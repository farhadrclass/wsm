And although I had some minor problems with it, I still enjoyed this book so much. First, who agrees with that quote above? Raise of hands please. Well, I totally do. Let me tell about you about Sarina. Sarina is getting married and she's about to see Eamon again after 7 years! Who is Eamon by the way? Well lets just say she's Sarinas 'There was this one time' so I guess its kinda normal that she's freaking out a little bit? What if she isn't over him like what she's saying?The One That Got Away is very light and fun. I can absolutely say that even though Sarina is older to me, she was relatable. I like her humor and how she thinks and acts towards her situation with Eamon. She have a fiance, and SHE KNOWS IT. Her action were very acceptable to me and I admire that the way she acts is perfect for her age! Not like some immature lady who is deprived of love. I never liked those characters.I had some problems with the pacing though. It was slow and there was a moment when I feel like it was dragging. I had to close it for awhile and talk myself into picking it up again.But the way the story wrapped up was realistically written and I really liked it. I was even stoked when I found out that there'll be more for Bethany Chase's other characters. I'm really looking forward to that. Overall, The One That Got Away is recommended for readers who inhales books in this genre. If you're looking for a beach read or a book for a lazy afternoon? TOTGA is perfect for that too!"}, {"userName": "Chelsea (chelseadolling reads)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16219087-chelsea-chelseadolling-reads", "userReview": "Contemporary-A-Thon read # 6: (doesn\u2019t apply to a challenge) - COMPLETE!This was cute!

A schoolgirl infatuation . . . where is he now, and more importantly, does he remember you? Yum!Loved the opening: That name you Google at two o\u2019clock in the morning.

Sarina\u2019s one night stand, a former fling seven years ago. She has never heard from him since. Not even a drunken late-night booty text. A guy she has never forgotten. Her roommate Danny\u2019s best friend from college. Sarina, now thirty-one an architect in Austin, TX has a dependable and stable boyfriend of four years, Noah\u2014 currently in Buenos Aires, working on a corporate merger. Noah made it so easy to fall in love with him\u2014 his southern charm; she could see a future with him, marriage. Noah, of course does not know she and Eamon slept together, once upon a time. OMG, now Eamon, a retired Olympic swimmer is BACK in Austin, asking her to renovate his new fixer-upper.Sarina: \u201cAnd God also knows the last thing I need is a time-sucking micro-project for an obsessive perfectionist. Especially one who will probably expect me to work for him as a favor because he deigned to sleep with me back at the dawn of time. No thank you.\u201d  However, she DOES love fixers! We, in the design world can relate to the temptation of the job, more so than the guy.  Let the fun begin, OR should we say \"a love triangle\". Maybe having Eamon back in Austin, will not be so bad? What does she really want?  Timing sucks.  Sarina: \u201cI watch till the lights of his car disappear around the corner, then exhale a slow breath. This is not good. This is not good at all. Despite my resolution to put a bullet in my crush, I\u2019ve been using his project as a way to indulge my craving to be near him, and, instead of burning out, it\u2019s just getting stronger.

From romance, sass, passionate kisses, Texas fun, sex, lust, jealousy, guilt, the south, roommates, cocktails, karaoke, hipsters, design, good friends, clients, love, crying, and laughing, a compelling and engaging chick-lit debut!  Fans of (my favs) Emily Giffin, Jennifer Weiner, Wendy Wax, and Sarah Pekkanen will devour THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY, and Chase\u2019s wit, charming banter, clever storytelling, and realistic portrayal of modern relationships, and cast of likable characters. Second Book: Can\u2019t wait for her upcoming second novel, featuring Sarina\u2019s brother in law, Colin and friend Hilary and more from Sarina and Eamon. (excerpt included). An author to follow. Personal storyI had to laugh thinking of my very young and innocent crush story. At a mere age of thirteen (looked sixteen),  with my parents and little sis in Florida for family summer vacation. In walks, Saul Griffith, Jr. age sixteen, hot, buff, sexy blonde, tan California surfer; on vacation with his grandparents\u2014staying at the same hotel. With innocent talks on the beach (within my parent\u2019s view, of course)  and a few stolen kisses. My strict Southern Baptist parents refused to allow me to accompany his family to dinner, upon their invitation. At thirteen, this was the end of the world. I hated my parents--- he was leaving the following morning.The next morning, the bellman comes to our hotel door, and informs me I have a message waiting at the front desk. I am rushing out the door, hoping he is still here in Florida. Unfortunately, it was a letter from SG telling me they had to leave and he wanted to say good-bye and how much he enjoyed meeting me, etc. \u2014I cried and cried over this stupid letter. Long forgotten, cannot recall exactly what was in the letter; however, remember re-reading this note for years before it was thrown away. Of course, back in the day, we did not have cell phones or emails, but I think he left his address. Of course, now divorced much older and much wiser - this book made me think about this one guy. Sorry, Bethany, I am a web analyst and pro searching the web; Curious, no luck on Google except for a famous Australian inventor which does not fit the age range (unless it is his son). Oh, well the blonde tanned good-looking surfer, at age sixteen is probably now fat, bald, and a loser.  The original image is a much better memory! Congrats, on a winner!  Could easily be a 5-star, but want to save a star for your next one.

The title of this book really says it all. Sirana -- a young architect -- is dating Noah -- a corporate lawyer currently based in Argentina. Seven years earlier, Sirana spent what she thought of as a very special night with Eamon -- an Olympic swimmer -- but Eamon disappeared immediately without an explanation. Then Eamon reappears, and the rest you can imagine but I will avoid any spoilers. The enjoyment of some books depends on where and when you read them. I read The One That Got Away while traveling on a 4 hour flight, and it was perfect entertainment to distract me from the tedium and crush of an overcrowded flight. While the story is predictable and while Sirana's self delusion started grating on me toward the end, what made this book very readable and a great distraction were the characters. Sirana, Eamon, Noah and their friends are lovely characters, and Sirana's relationship with her stepfather John is especially touching. The comparison to Jennifer Weiner seems apt -- the characters are smart, funny and not unidimensional. On occasion when the mood is right for the book equivalent of a romantic comedy, I would be happy to read another book by Bethany Chase."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "I picked up a copy of this book because of the references to authors, Emily Giffin and Jennifer Weiner. This book started out good. So much to the point that I had to stop reading for the moment to quickly go to my co-worker and have her read a certain passage in relation to when Eamon appears and Sarina's friend, Nicole sees Eamon after he has been gone for a long time. The conversation goes like this:Nicole is peering at Eamon like Gollum at the Ring. \"God damn\". \"He got even hotter. I can't believe you hit that, you lucky bitch.\"Sarina-\"If you mention that , I will shank you and leave your child motherless.\"I proceeded to keep reading this book for a while. I got about half way and put the book down. I came back to it after a short break but things changed and I realized that without the humor which then started to be few and far between, the characters were not that interesting and I felt no real chemistry involving Sarina, her current boyfriend, Noah or even Eamon.

But, if you ask me what my favourite book is, I\u2019ll tell you Something Borrowed by Emily Giffin. It\u2019s one of the only novels about cheating that I can stand (and I say this in every review I write that blurs the lines in regards to cheating). It\u2019s a hard balance to get right, so when I heard about The One That Got Away by Bethany Chase, not only did Emily Giffin\u2019s novel Love The One You\u2019re With spring to mind, but I was also DESPERATE to read it, because there aren\u2019t many authors like Emily Giffin. Some have tried, but none even come close to her greatness. Sometimes you just know you\u2019re going to love a book before you\u2019ve finished the first page, and I knew as soon as I started that The One That Got Away was a book you must NOT miss this year.I\u2019ve had a bit of a drought with regards to good Chick Lit books. They\u2019re few and far between these days, as a lot of them peddle the same stuff time and time again so I\u2019ve been mixing up my genres and, despite the fact I\u2019ve read 17 books so far in 2015, this is my first five-star Chick Lit read (or Women\u2019s Fiction, I literally don\u2019t care what name you use!) and comes at a welcome time when I barely even started my last book before giving up.The great thing about the novel is it will likely have a lot of people wondering about their ones who got away (or didn\u2019t get away, the lucky ducks) and Sarina is one of the most refreshing people to ever tell a story. I loved her. I loved her honesty, I loved that she was all girl-power and wanting to make her own way in the world, and I loved that she didn\u2019t actually cheat on Noah. That\u2019s ALWAYS my bug bear in these novels, where relationships start from cheating and then you\u2019re always on edge for ever more, because you just can\u2019t base a relationship on cheating (and only Something Borrowed has changed my mind on that, no other book has managed it). I loved that for a long time Sarina was loyal to Noah \u2013 at the end of the day, it would have been so easy to just forget Noah and jump in to bed with Eamon. A guy who digs you and is in your own state vs a guy who digs you all the way from Argentina? No contest, but Sarina was different.Sarina and Eamon are on a knife-edge the whole novel. We know how Sarina feels, but it takes ages before we see how Eamon feels, and I liked their banter. It wasn\u2019t always clean (in regards to Noah, I mean) but it toed the line enough that I was okay with it. I loved Eamon. I loved that he was so willing to let Sarina, a fantastic architect (Ted Mosby would have loved her!) help with his house re-build on his return to Austin. It was so cool to see how much Eamon appreciated and \u201cgot\u201d Sarina\u2019s plans for his house. Heck, it was just so cool to see Sarina being an architect. That\u2019s not what you see every day, but like Eamon, I totally got her vision. I loved how she appreciated buildings and put so much effort in to her work and it was a really fun to get a glimpse in to Sarina\u2019s work life. What made Sarina\u2019s dream of being an architect even more amazing was John, her step-dad. I love how he instilled so much in to her, and inspired her to become an architect and how John would get SO excited to see Sarina\u2019s work and the plans for Eamon\u2019s house etc.The One That Got Away was pretty much a pitch-perfect novel, I loved the triangle-that-wasn\u2019t-really-a-triangle, I loved Sarina\u2019s relationships with everyone in her life most especially John, who was such a special character. Sarina had such great friends, too! Danny and Nicole were amazing friends. Probably my only fly in the ointment was View Spoiler \u00bb I suspect though that that spoiler is just me being prim and proper. This novel made me laugh, it made me cry, and gave me that wonderful feeling in my stomach when two characters just finally do what you\u2019ve been wanting them to do for ages. Sigh, I miss that feeling, it\u2019s a rarity these days. The One That Got Away is a must read, I swear. And I am SO excited that the next book is Colin\u2019s story. The Roy family are the Maddoxes of the Chick Lit world\u2026 and I can\u2019t wait for the next installment!"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93254-michelle", "userReview": "Charming book I gobbled up in one sitting on a plane. I have an ARC, which doesn't have the final (amazing) cover art, so I was going to say that it is perfect for Emily Giffin fans (but even better ;) ). Then I see that Emily Giffin has a blurb on the cover! Perfect match! In this, protagonist Sarina is an about-to-be married architect who ends up working on a project with an ex. While this might sounds like standard fare, what sets this book apart is the sharp, funny writing, the Austin setting (love when an author ventures outside of the typical New York!), the delicious descriptions of homes and interiors (descriptions of the Blue Ridge Mountains are also spectacular), and perhaps, most of all, the beautiful, moving relationship between Sarina and her stepfather. It is so refreshing to read something where the main character does have some \"pain\" from her childhood but it's not because her parents were negligent or selfish jerks. Their relationship is such a highlight of the book. On top of this, I love how important Sarina's career is to her...it's not a sideshow as it is in most books of this genre.

On the cusp of success career-wise, she feels content with her job\u00a0and her relationship with her boyfriend Noah, who is thousand of miles away for work. None of the projects she has done could have prepared her for her next job involving \"the One.\"\u00a0Sarina's \"one that got away\" is Eamon Roy. After a one night stand and one hell of a connection, Eamon disappears, leaving Sarina heartbroken and feeling silly for envisioning him anything more than a one time thing. Now he's back in town and he wants her to remodel and design his new house \u2014 a job that will take well over a year. She doesn't plan on his presence awakening her heart.What I really liked about this book is\u00a0its premise. The idea that you get a second chance with that \"one\" from your past. An opportunity\u00a0for a do over. That small minuscule possibility that this person may feel something for you. Sarina's emotions were all over the place and rightfully so. Eamon's arrival shook up her whole world, leading her to ask herself some pretty important questions: Do I like him? Does he like me? Why did he leave? What should I do? But I love Noah...Noah...Noah. What do I want?While there is romance in this book, it's more of a journey of self-discovery for Sarina. Not only is she faced with making big relationship choices, she must has to decide what she wants out of life, what is important to her.I had a hard time being fully connected to Sarina and Eamon as a couple. The author presents Eamon\u00a0as a\u00a0swoon\u00a0worthy, funny, sweet, and kind guy. He and Sarina have the same sense of humor and are like-minded. They are perfect for each other in a lot of ways, but I feel like I needed more time with them to see their connection instead of connecting\u00a0the dots for myself. Also, towards the end of the book, there was a lot of contrived back and forth between Eamon and Sarina. Some of Eamon's behavior towards the end was very contrary to his supposed feelings for her, especially considering what he had asked of her. I'm all for characters making mistakes, but what his actions seemed out of character.I would recommend this book to someone looking for a sweet second-chance romance and thread of self-discovery. I definitely look forward to reading about Eamon's brother, Colin, and Hillary in the next book!* I received a copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.3 stars\n____________________________________________\u2605 Check out my list of UPCOMING BOOK RELEASES!!____________________________________________Find more of my reviews & other bookish things here:\u2725 Read this review on the blog!\u2725 My blog Reading Books Like a Boss\u2725 Like on Facebook\u2725 Follow on Twitter\u2725 Pin with me on Pinterest\u2725 Follow on Instagram\u2725 Subscribe by Email"}, {"userName": "Mary Kubica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18174103-mary-kubica", "userReview": "I simply can't say enough good things about this book.

I could not put this one down. Thoughtful, fun, and full of crazy tension. Plus it was set in Austin. So much to love.--- complete thoughts first posted on Rather Be Reading Blog.Sarina. She\u2019s hungry two hours after she eats. (I can relate.) She\u2019s creative. She is protective of her independence. She\u2019s also completely confused about her path, and I don\u2019t blame her. How many times have we made the safe choice that makes us somewhat happy because we are too scared, too apprehensive to switch gears even if it means the possibility of extreme happiness? Too many times to count, I\u2019m sure.Here we have Sarina perfectly content with her relationship (even if it\u2019s mostly long distance right now) and diving head first into her new business, trying to make a name for herself. She has great friends, a cat who loves her, and yet when Eamon comes back into her life \u2014 a guy she had such a connection with years ago but never called her after their night together \u2014 something shifts. I don\u2019t for one second think that Eamon is the sole reason why she started questioning the way her life was going. The catalyst would have come sooner or later. Maybe, just maybe, there is more to the life she has carefully crafted for herself.From the very beginning, the chemistry between Sarina and Eamon is off the charts but I have to give my girl some credit \u2014 she has self-control. Sure, many of her thoughts revolve around him, she loves spending time with him, but the boundaries don\u2019t exactly breakdown like they could have. (Like I\u2019ve seen them do so in other books.) Instead, Sarina and Eamon build a professional relationship (she\u2019s helping him fix up a house), laugh together, and slowly begin to lean on each other. At the same time, Sarina deeply cares about her boyfriend and doesn\u2019t foresee ending things with him. She throws herself into work, skypes with the boyfriend, visits with her beloved stepdad, and silently obsesses over Eamon until she realizes things can\u2019t remain the same anymore.Does her partner understand her? Is her business going in the direction she wants it to? Should she have to choose between her career and the kids she doesn\u2019t have yet? Will she ever stop mourning her mother\u2019s death? Is she scared of being happy? Of being honest with herself? Debut author Bethany Chase attacks each of these questions thoughtfully, peppered with humor and sexy moments. Halfway through, the ache associated with ending a book was already (!!) setting in. I already knew it would be hard to leave Sarina, her Austin, these friends, and her journey. That feeling is so heartbreaking but, at the same time, that\u2019s how you know a book is special, right?The One That Got Away covered a larger expanse of time then I imagined it would, and Sarina was constantly surprising me. Ice cream in bed, road trips, sweet supporting characters, late night drinking, and the promise of rustic home decor mixed in with all those difficult, big kid moments we hate to deal with \u2014 I am a solid supporter of this novel and can\u2019t wait to check out what Bethany is cooking up next."}, {"userName": "Christina (Ensconced in Lit)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3854740-christina-ensconced-in-lit", "userReview": "After blazing through and loving Results May Vary, I immediately went and picked up Chase's first book. I was not disappointed.The One That Got Away by Bethany Chase stars Sarina, who is a fiercely intelligent and driven architect (by the way, this was one of my favorite parts of the novel), and is almost engaged to a wonderful man, Noah. But an old flame from the past, Eamon, reappears when Noah is gone on a long extended business trip, and Sarina starts to realize that perhaps her perfect relationship is not so perfect after all.The writing I grew to love in Results May Vary is great here as well. And Sarina is a terrific, strong protagonist just like her counterpart Caroline. Eamon is smoking hot, and Noah is the sad, third wheel who is kind, but rather boring. I absolutely loved the fact Sarina was an architect and that she was driven to build a business for herself. She was obviously talented, and I loved the descriptions of how she designed her projects. There was one particular part of the book, which was my favorite, where she takes a random trip and it really changes things for her. I enjoyed reading about her and Eamon together, they were a sizzling couple from start to finish, and Danny and her stepfather John among others were entertaining secondary characters. Also, this book hit a very personal note, which made it that more poignant to me. Before I met my husband, I was in a relationship with a guy who told me after years of dating that he wanted a wife who didn't have a career and would stay at home with the kids. It was clear I was not that woman, and maybe it was in the heat of the moment, but I was devastated. It's difficult already in this cultural climate to have a career as a woman, but to have someone so close to me tell me something like that really rocked my world. So I could completely empathize and understand what Sarina was going through. And ultimately, I couldn't stop reading this book and read it in one sitting just like Results May Vary.A couple of personal issues (MINOR SPOILER ALERT): I don't like to read about people that think about cheating or cheat, and regardless of the circumstances, I'm not thrilled about it. I would especially think someone in their 30s to get a clue and realize there is something wrong with the relationship she is currently in if she can only think about another guy (but then again this is probably realistic thinking about the affair/divorce statistics). That said, Chase makes it a bit more palatable the way it all turns out in the end but I wish it were more of a conscious decision. I'm also not thrilled how Eamon totally pursues her even though she's practically engaged. That seems like a huge red flag for me, especially when Sarina very accurately points out that he likes to win and is a major competitor.Overall, a fast read with a fun, flirty and sizzling romance, but even more, a wonderful woman power book in which a talented, driven woman can succeed."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Tibbs", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8513995-stephanie-tibbs", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Ilariafiamma", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31069537-ilariafiamma", "userReview": "Soporifero."}, {"userName": "Carla", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2352516-carla", "userReview": "well, wasn't that just lovely."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3956348-jennifer", "userReview": "4.5/5 starsThe One That Got Away is a Chick Lit/Adult contemporary romance.The narrator is Sarina a 31 year old woman who has her own architecture business in Austin Texas. Danny is her funny/gay roommate. She is almost engaged to Noah (who is working out of town).The premise of the story is that 7 years before she had a fling with Danny's good friend swimming star Eamon. Now Noah is out of town and Eamon is moving back to Austin. And he wants to hire Sarina for a project.One thing I wish the author did was tell the reader how to pronounce Eamon. I enjoy unusual names. But I strongly dislike if I am not sure how to pronounce a name. I could not figure out if it was A-mon or Ee-mon (like Easter). I actually really enjoyed this book even more than I thought I would like it. The blurb sounded interesting. But the book had the right balance of heartbreak, sadness, and funny banter. If you enjoy Chick Lit then the book is engaging and enjoyable.There were quite a few original aspects to the story. First Eamon was a former Olympic swimmer. I absolutely loved this. My niece is a competitive swimmer so I really enjoyed hearing all of the details that pertained to swimming.Also Sarina was an architect. I loved this! She was so good at her job. What a fantastic occupation for a female narrator. I loved learning everything about what she did. It was fascinating.There is one part of the book that I can't decide if I liked or not: the leaps in time. It's not uncommon for a book to go forward a few weeks, but often it is mentioned as \"six weeks later\". In The One That Got Away there were numerous leaps in time and the reader just had to figure it out and follow along.I enjoyed many of the characters especially Sarina, Eamon and Danny. I know that books have to have conflict. And I respect that Danny did not pick sides (with his friendships with Eamon and Sarina). However, I think that so many of the problems in this story could have been avoided if Danny had talked to both Sarina and Eamon.Because I tend not to read the full book description (I dislike book spoilers and find that often the book blurbs give too much detail) the book took a very unexpected turn for me. I think I was expecting the book to be a fairly light read. But there were definitely some aspects that made me cry.The One That Got Away is a wonderful title that really gets to the point of what the book is about. I am sure that many people can relate to the idea of someone that they dated that got away. It was this intriguing concept that drew me to this book. And I must say that I was not disappointed. This book was excellent for a debut novel. I cannot say enough good things about it. Definitely a surprising and engaging novel.Thanks to Random House Publishing Group/Ballantine books and edelweiss for allowing me to read this e-book."}, {"userName": "Jaime Arkin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293701-jaime-arkin", "userReview": "The One That Got Away magically appeared on my doorstep courtesy of Ballentine Books, and while the summary sounded interesting I added it to my to be read pile, but thought I\u2019d get to it when I could.

That name you Google at two o\u2019clock in the morning.

She has amazing friends, she\u2019s in a wonderful relationship with her boyfriend Noah, and she owns her own architecture business that is just starting to take off. But when Eamon Roy, the now retired Olympic swimmer she used to have a thing for, shows back up and wants to hire her to help remodel his new home, she suddenly begins to question everything she has planned for future. I don\u2019t want to make you think that Eamon is the only reason behind Sarina\u2019s reevaluating her life, because he is only one part of the story. There\u2019s more here than just a chance at rekindling a romance.I love YA books you guys\u2026 you know this, but I honestly love when I can find women\u2019s fiction that I just absolutely fall for, and this was one of those books. I love being able to relate to characters that have experienced a bit of life already, and Bethany Chase does an amazing job creating that.From the plot to the characters to the use of one of my favorite tropes, I really just absolutely loved this. There were a few things that kind of bugged me a bit\u2026 I feel like some of the drama could have been alleviated if Sarina and Eamon had had a conversation, but overall this story just was a wonderful read. Chase creates a charming story of second chances, loss and love, filled with romantic, sexy and sweet moments\u2026 exactly what I was looking for when I picked it up! Definitely grab this one if you\u2019re looking for something in the women\u2019s fiction genre, with a strong voice and wonderful writing."}, {"userName": "MM Finck", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8549560-mm-finck", "userReview": "Chase may be a new voice on the scene, but she will most assuredly be a long-running one. The Austin/SXSW setting was perfect. Sarina, Eamon, and Noah were utterly human. Flawed and magnetic. I felt everything Sarina felt. The dilemma of being a talented, ambitious woman with a career she is killing herself to build, butting up against convention and her own desire for children and a husband hit me very close to home - which is a good thing. Chase wrote this woman so expertly that I felt that I was her. I too loved Noah. I too relaxed into myself with Eamon. The narrative line of Sarina's mother and stepfather John drew on another emotional level that was equally compelling. The love scenes too were crazy-hot. Perfectly drawn. I couldn't be more thrilled that Sarina and others will be living on in her next novel. I will be recommending this book to anyone within hearing distance for a year to come. *** read as an ARC. review posted with permission from the publisher. ***"}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie", "userReview": "I really liked this book.
