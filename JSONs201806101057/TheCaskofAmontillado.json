Since there are dozens of posts here, my review will take a particular slant: what German pessimistic philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer has to say about the psychology of revenge and how the revengeful narrator in Poe\u2019s tale relates to Schopenhauer\u2019s insights.Schopenhauer says we all suffer as the result of nature or chance but, as humans, we recognizes that is simply the way life works. He then writes, \u201cSuffering caused by the will of another, on the other hand, includes a quite peculiar and bitter addition to the pain or injury itself, namely the consciousness of someone else\u2019s superiority, whether in point of strength or of cunning, together with that of one\u2019s own impotence.\u201d It\u2019s that person to person dynamic that gives us the real sting; someone intentionally shoves or hits us, humiliates or insults us, and, for whatever reason, we simply take it. This is what happened in the aristocrat-narrator\u2019s mind \u2013 he was insulted by Fortunato. I say \u2018in the aristocrat-narrator\u2019s mind\u2019 since we as readers don\u2019t know if Fortunato actually intended to insult him.Schopenhauer sees two phases of compensation for the person who has suffered at the hands of another. 1) direct and legal \u2013 a stranger hits us and we take him to court and win a settlement 2) revenge \u2013 to deal with the psychological afterglow of the stranger\u2019s blow. Here are his words: \u201cRecompense, if possible, can cure the injury done; but that bitter addition, the feeling \u2018and that is what I have to put up with from you\u2019 which often hurts more than the injury itself, can be neutralized only by revenge.\u201d The narrator says his is not of a nature to merely threat. Being an aristocrat himself, that is, someone who is accustom to living life and having life on his own terms, he will not even consider direct or legal action or a mere threat. His first step is revenge, and a revenge where he will never be discovered or punished for exacting his revenge and a revenge where Fortunato will be fully aware he is the avenger. Here is the payoff for the avenger as Schopenhauer sees it: \u201cBy returning the injury, either by force or by cunning, we demonstrate our superiority over him who has injured us and thereby annul the proof he gave of his superiority over us. Thus the heart acquires the satisfaction it thirsted for. Where, consequently there is much pride or much vanity, there will also be much reveangefulness.\u201d This is where the philosopher\u2019s insights fit the characters in Poe\u2019s tale like a finely made Italian glove. Fortunato is a pompous aristocrat, a man full of himself, a man who, in the course of the story, calls another man by the name of Luchresi an ignoramus since Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry. The narrator, in turn, with his vaults and wines, his family crest and family motto, is filled to the brim with pride and vanity. And as he locks Fortunato to the damp wall and seals him up in the cold, dark nave, we as readers get the feeling his revenge is as sweet as sweet can be. As Alfred Hitchcock said, \u201cRevenge is sweet and not fattening.\u201dSchopenhauer\u2019s words on the psychology of the avenger are penetrating. He writes, \u201cBut, as every fulfilled desire reveals itself more or less as a delusion, so does that for revenge. Usually the pleasure we hoped for from it is made bitter by the pity we afterwards feel; indeed, an exacted revenge will often subsequently break the heart and torment the conscience; we no longer feel the motivation which drove us to it, but the proof of our wickedness remains visibly before us.\u201d Poe\u2019s tale ends with the narrator-avenger completing his stone and plaster task and feeling his heart grow sick from the dampness of the catacombs. But this is the rub. He feels his heart grow sick but it this truly caused by the dampness of the catacombs? Might the narrator-avenger experience pity and hear-break and a torment of consciousness in the days, weeks and years to come? If he is not mad, then perhaps; if he is mad, then perhaps not. Since this is a tale written by Edgar Allan Poe, madness is always a real possibility. Thus, we can imagine the narrator-avenger spending his remaining days drinking wine from his vaults with a smug, satisfied smile, knowing there is one more pile of bones in his collection."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201dA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from thethroat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For abrief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I beganto grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instantreassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs,and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells ofhim who clamoured. I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volumeand in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\u201d\nThe terror of this tale isn\u2019t just in the final act, but in the behavior of the narrator, Montresor. I read this story several times, trying to grasp the level of madness from which he suffers. Is this truly a tale of revenge as he states to us in the beginning, or is it a tale of jealousy fueled by insanity? Poor Fortunato, who is not fortunate at all, believes he is with a friend when he ventures down into the Montresorian Vaults to taste a cask of Amontillado. It is carnival in this unnamed Italian city, and Fortunato is dressed as a fool, and he is so drunk that, though he calls himself a wine expert, I am led to believe he is more of a drunken sod than an connoisseur. Montresor says at the very beginning of this story that he has been insulted by a \u201dthousand injuries,\u201d all perpetrated by Fortunato. I\u2019ve known a couple of people in my lifetime who considered any slight a major assault against them. It has been almost debilitating for them. Every molehill becomes a mountain in their minds. Most of us just slough those things off like a sprinkle of rain, but to thin skinned people, those slights become a torrential downpour of despair and projected animosity. Montresor believes that Fortunato looks down upon him. There is this moment in the story when the Montresor coat of arms is revealed: a golden foot on a blue background crushing a snake whose fangs are embedded in the foot's heel, with the motto Nemo me impune lacessit (\"No one attacks me with impunity\"). The question is, depending on how you read this tale, is Montresor the snake being crushed or is he the embedded fangs? Maybe, he is both. Montresor expects Fortunato to insult him, so every odd look or misplaced word from Fortunato becomes a condemnation of his friend, Montresor. Montresor might feel crushed, but he is about to embed his fangs.\nFortunato makes a symbolic motion with his arm and discovers that Montresor is not a Mason, though Montresor insists that he is, even showing Fortunato the trowel that is in his hand as proof. Of course, showing the trowel is great foreshadowing for the final act of immurement. The fact that Fortunato does not believe Montresor is further proof that he despises him. Montresor could have enacted his revenge anywhere. It is carnival season. The perfect time for a strangulation, a knifing, a drowning or a bludgeoning, and Fortunato would just be thought of as an unfortunate victim of some ruffians, but Montresor wants something more. He wants Fortunato to forever reside among the bones of his ancestors. He doesn\u2019t just want him dead. He wants to OWN him forever. The revenge, if that is what this is, will never end. \nIllustration by Harry Clarke.There is this moment when Montresor realizes he isn\u2019t feeling well. \u201dMy heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs.\u201d At the beginning of this sentence, I\u2019m feeling oddly relieved to discover that he is feeling some remorse, maybe the madness that has taken him over has finally been overcome by some horror at his own actions, but of course, all of that is quickly dispelled by him blaming those feelings on the dampness. There are a couple of points, too, where he suggests to Fortunato that they should turn back, but he tempered each of those suggestions with a prod that would insure that his inebriated friend would want to continue. Is this a demented way to assuage his guilt? Can he convince himself that he tried to save him, but it was Fortunato\u2019s choice to continue to his death? Edgar Allan Poe is most assuredly playing with your mind as he does in most of his stories. He sprinkles little clues that for the discerning reader are there to be discovered. My suggestion is to read this story a few times, and each time, hopefully, a new layer of the story will reveal itself to you. This is an excellent example of Poe and by some people considered his best short story.

I'm going to go out on a limb and argue that it's not. The only notion we have of revenge--of the narrator, Montresor, actually being wronged--comes in the wonderfully vague opening sentence: \"The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.\" It's Montresor himself who insists this is a revenge tale, but of course he's the ultimate unreliable narrator, so we shouldn't take him at his word. Notice that we get not a single detail concerning any of these injuries or insults. Typically you'd expect someone plotting revenge to stew over all those little details ad nauseam. Instead, we only know that Fortunato is a wine connoisseur and that \"[i]n painting and gemmary Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack.\" It seems that, at some level, Montresor simply doesn't like Fortunato (or perhaps doesn't like all Italians, especially Fortunato) and decides to kill him for no other reason than that. You also get the sense that Fortunato is more successful than the narrator (his name, Fortunato, isn't particularly subtle), so perhaps the killing is simply the result of jealousy. There's also that wonderful scene where Fortunato makes a Masonic sign, which the narrator doesn't understand (and call \"grotesque\"), and Montresor replies by producing a trowel from beneath his clothes and saying he's a mason, too. A grim joke, but one that points again to the jealousy burning inside him.OK, enough argument! The most important point is that this a wonderfully macabre tale that reprises several of Poe's major themes. I won't spoil the ending. I'll just say that it's a tale that leaves you thinking long after the reading is done. Not just thinking, but feeling: the damp caverns, the piles of bones, and the ever thickening \"nitre\" that \"hangs like moss upon the vaults.\""}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "Possibly my favorite Edgar Allen Poe story! Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature:Our narrator Montresor, an Italian nobleman, explains \u2015 in a suspiciously vague way \u2015 how his friend Fortunato has mortally offended and insulted him. Montresor sets himself on a course of implacable revenge \u2026 but he wants to do so in a way that Fortunato understands that Montresor is the source of revenge, but without being caught or punished.Montresor and Fortunato meet during a carnival festival \u2015 which at first seems by chance, but then you find out that Montresor has set up the situation so that all of his servants are gone (he told them that he would be out all night, but that they were NOT permitted to leave, and counted on the lure of the carnival to do the rest). Montresor tells Fortunato that he has bought a cask of fine Amontillado sherry at full price, but he isn\u2019t certain if it\u2019s the real thing. Fortunato, a connoisseur of old wines, volunteers to taste it.And so the two go (Montresor first donning a mask) to Montresor\u2019s palazzo and then into the depths of its damp catacombs hung with white webs of nitre, Montresor protesting all the time that his friend really shouldn\u2019t come, but all the time luring him in like an evil-hearted spider \u2026\u201cThe Cask of Amontillado\u201d is one of Poe\u2019s truly memorable horror stories, a tale of vengeance, and more enigmatic and complex than it appeared to me on first read, many years ago. Poe, as always, is great at atmosphere and setting. It\u2019s a tense revenge tale with some black humor, and some interesting ambiguities about guilt. There are so many ironic and symbolic details that add depth to the story: The irony of Fortunato\u2019s name, the \u201csupreme madness of the carnival season\u201d that echoes the narrator\u2019s mental state, the fool costume that Fortunato is wearing at the carnival, and many more. \u201cMontresor\u201d could be translated from French as \u201cmy treasure\u201d; it leads one to mull over what exactly is the narrator\u2019s treasure.Free to read online many places, including here.

Perhaps one of my favorite of all Poe's works, this literary genius stimulates one of everyone's deepest and scariest fears: to be buried alive. Though there are several macabre options to consider, in this fantastic tale set in Italy, a man is buried alive behind a brick wall. Poe goes to great lengths to describe the process, the emotions and the setting. As a reader, you are entranced in the action, caring little about the characters or the reasons why it's happening. You read each line in fear, wondering how it will all end. What I love about Poe's work is his ability to draw readers into a darkness that permeates all our senses. As you read the story, all five of your physical senses react to the vengeance plot he's fabricated... from the damp and dank smell of the dirt to the scraping of the mortar against the bricks, your body will twist and turn at the thought of what lengths mankind will when they are angry and hurt.Take a chance on this one... it'll give you a great sense of who Poe was both as a writer and as a villain.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

The narrator, Montresor, opens the story by stating that he has been insulted by his acquaintance, Fortunato, on numerous occasions and he wants to exact revenge. However, he wants to do so in a measured way without raising any suspicion. He knows that Fortunato is a connoisseur of wine. He approaches Fortunato during a carnival wearing a mask of black silk. He tells Fortunato that he has bought some wine that could be Amontillado, a light Spanish sherry. Fortunato (Italian for \u201cfortunate\u201d) wears the multi-coloured costume of the court jester, including a cone cap with bells. Is the shadow of the ratA sign of soon-to-come death? Montresor is an extremely shrewd person and wants Fortunato to play into his hands, so he tells him that if he is too busy, he will ask a man named Luchesi to taste the wine. Fortunato scoffs on hearing this. He claims that Luchesi could not differentiate between Amontillado and other types of sherry.  Fortunato is eager to taste the wine so that he could determine for Montresor whether it is truly Amontillado. Fortunato insists that they go to Montresor\u2019s vaults. So the latter quickly takes the former there. He had already told his servants that he would return in the morning and he wanted none of them to leave the house during his absence. He knew too well that they would consider this to be an excellent chance to go the carnival, leaving the house all for himself. Is this the passage to death? How will Montresor take revenge on Fortunato once they are in the underground vaults? Or will his conscience get the better of him, making him change his mind at the last minute? Will it be Fortunato who will be fortunate enough to read Montresor\u2019s mind and make good his escape in the nick of time? Read the story and find out yourself.So much to fearDoomsday is near. Colour and costume play a major part in this short story. Montresor wears a black silk mask. A mask acts like a shield covering one\u2019s true motives. Black is mostly associated with evil, dark and the underworld. Silk is smooth which could also allude to a smooth and slippery person. The vaults are underground which is pitch black, so they could be easily associated with the underworld where sinister and macabre things take place.  Fortunato is wearing a multi-coloured costume of the court jester. Multi-coloured could stand for a lively person, which Fortunato is. However, court jesters are renowned for their buffoonery and foolishness. There is every likelihood that Fortunato might turn out to be a fool and easily lured into Montresor\u2019s trap.

Because underneath the gratification of vengeance, there stands a wood into which Montr\u00e9sor does not which to lead us. He might find himself lost in the mists of his imagination. On the surface, it is easy to identify with our protagonist as he has suffered a thousand slights. We all know at least one Fortunato, especially in high school. In later life, when we have presumably learned to maintain our dignity in the face of low insults, the stakes are raised. The arena can be a professional setting to which we are shackled by economic necessity, returning daily to the chafing of the cubicle and the nitrate of water cooler gossip. It may even be an arena of our own construct in which we suffer the stalemate of abusive relationships, whether its scars are visible on the skin or not. By measure of violent and unbridled emotion, we would like to condemn our personal Fortunato to the most languid and contemplative manner of death known to man. Or woman. Our parting words before the last brick goes into place might even contain a pun on the name. There would be none of the sophisticated mechanical systems in place to alert anyone to The Premature Burial which were in vogue in Poe's time*.On second thought, If an insult to the family name was the straw that broke the camel's back, then why not simply resort to the gentleman's tradition of cold steel? Given the Venetian setting, either party was unlikely to perish: Italians had a reputation for squeamishness, with honour satisfied at the slightest draw of blood. \u201dThe thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.\u201dWhat is the nature of the thousand precedents that warrant this instance? We shall learn nothing of this from the mouth of our narrator, unless, for all his insight into the psyche of other men, he betrays himself to both the audience and the fool. Needless to say, he commits this error on two separate occasions, even before the two characters meet at the Carnaval: \"He had a weak point\u2014this Fortunato\u2014although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine [but] in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could\".  And more overtly in the discreet safety of the catacombs. Fortunato, however, fails to detect the veiled threat in his imbibed state. \"You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter\".He lures his victim with Pride. Yet which of the seven cardinal sins drive him? Mere Anger, or Envy? Does Montr\u00e9sor find his vineyard expertise outmatched, has it driven him to financial ruin? Has his standing in the community suffered accordingly? His lineage stretches back centuries, but what about the pedigree of Fortunato? Do we witness the proverbial clash between the old nobility and the nouveau riche? The part of Fortunato in the situation is particularly foggy; the opening statement hints at a gradual deterioration of their acquaintance. Yet even in sobriety he remains oblivious to a fault. It is also impossible to determine whether Montr\u00e9sor misreads him. I am disinclined to think that a singular incident pushed him over the edge. Whatever the origins of his silent wrath, Montr\u00e9sor is a man consumed. His thirst for revenge seems to stem as much from his character as from any wrongdoing by Fortunato\u2019s hand.  \u201dYou, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat\u2026 I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong. It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face.\u201d The measure of his cold-blooded predetermination is manifested once more in an understated manner before we descend into the family catacombs:\"There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honor of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\"Fortunato certainly shows himself to be a persistent personality, to the point of stubbornness when reinforced by wine. He deflects repeated perverse offers to turn back from the damp atmosphere of the vaults. Right before the trap springs, he betrays a certain callousness which is the only hint that Montr\u00e9sor may be not wholly unjustified in his set-up.  \u201cProceed,\u201d I said; \u201cherein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi\u2014 \u201d \u201cHe is an ignoramus,\u201d interrupted my friend.\u201d Is this casual dismissal how he treats people to their face? Or is it merely the outspokenness of youth? Because the final, contect reflection by Montr\u00e9sor on the fate of his friend utterly shatters the mental image I spontaneously glimpsed. Fortunato was to have a rotund figure, the face beset by fleshy jowls, the wrinkles of the forties smoothed out by the fat under the skin. Montr\u00e9sor appeared to me as a sort of Duke of Alba: impeccable in both dress and manners, with a streak of gray through his Van Dyke beard. Imagine the words \"But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.\u201d - with th\u00e0t look.Yet unless the latter has achieved a longevity uncommon to the dawn of the 19th century, this was a young man\u2019s game played out as the Bastille was stormed. Fortunate\u2019s demise almost foreshadows that of the Venice Empire: \u201cFor the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.\u201dA reader well vested in vestments will pick up on this sooner, amidst what is in my view a rare moment of hilarity, provided that your tastes run as dark as the subaquatic tunnels.

The fact that Montr\u00e9sor keeps his mason tool on his person is a bit odd; wh\u00e8n exactly did he hide it there? He bows his vistor through his palazzo into the catacombs speedily. Did he have it with him at the Carnaval? Why not hide it under the bones together with his stones and mortar?

Closed my eyes... and listened.Arrhythmia!!The story itself was rather straight point. Fortnato did something that insult Montressor. Montressor vow for revenge.

His stories linger on recurring fears, and the subsequent deaths caused by paranoia. This one felt claustrophobic, like it was enclosed and encased in a veil of darkness and petty revenge. As soon as the characters entered the eerie catacombs it became apparent where this tale was going; it was like a big spoiler: it became obvious that only one would leave alive because that\u2019s Poe for you. Try to resist his words: \u201cA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated, I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I re-echoed, I aided, I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\u201dSpoilers coming. He has a wonderful ways of putting words together, a way that is completely enthralling. I love the way that he writes. His characters are usually really complex too. Poe uses many different reasons to justify murder. Well, at least to the perpetrator. He explains their complex psychology, and the madness that resulted in such a deed. This one, however, appeared rather normal. The narrator is pissed off with Fortuna. He tries to sell Fortuna some cheap knock off wine; it isn\u2019t a cask of Amontillado. He feels like a fool and wants some revenge for some vague reason. By Poe\u2019s standard this is all very mundane. This is a guy who has just ripping of another guy. As the story progresses it becomes much darker. Montresor is the real case study. He claims that Fortuna has insulted him beyond reason; he has given him a thousand injuries. But there is no such proof to the claim. All we see is one man systematically plan the murder of another. There is no reliability in the claim or the story itself. It\u2019s a killing that is covered up by a vague and weak excuse. Perhaps Montresor invented the insult to give him an excuse to indulge in his dark passion. Perhaps he has gone mad, and has perceived insults that were not there. Either way it ends with one man buried behind a wall, and another perpetual mystery raised by the enigmatic Poe."}, {"userName": "A.

What atmosphere could be more chilling than a man murdering another for revenge at Carnivale time in a unnamed part of Italy? The protagonist, Montresor, somehow holds Fortunato accountable for his own decline in fortunes. Fortunato (obviously relating to fortune) is a happy, respected and an admired member of society, who has risen through the ranks, possibly with the aid of The Freemasons. He is everything Montresor once was, and apparently has made a few derogatory comments about Montresor, although whether this is the reason for his murder, or whether the reason is an envy bordering on lunacy, is questionable.

There isn't much to say about this story without spoiling the ending, other than the mystery lay in the narrator's motive for murder.

This is the story of a man and his friend sampling a bottle of liquor, only for things to turn drastically wrong.I didn\u2019t think much of this story. It started off fair enough, and was well written, but the story made no sense. There were no reasons behind the main character\u2019s actions, and it caused a lot of confusion for me, trying to understand why this was happening. I enjoyed the story, but it was confusing and didn\u2019t make much sense whatsoever.The sense behind the story really annoyed me. There was none whatsoever, from what I could discern, and it made the story had to follow.I wouldn\u2019t personally recommend this to anyone, but there might be some classical and/or horror lovers out there who find this more enjoyable than I did.It was alright. It wasn\u2019t the best story to read in the world, and I read it very quickly and mostly skimmed it, just to get through it and progress through the Terrifying Tales compilation."}, {"userName": "Sohaib", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31777090-sohaib", "userReview": "Another little masterpiece in capturing the sense of dread, malice and foreboding evil to come.
