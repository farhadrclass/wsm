I loved the premise of setting up a hotel in Ireland and found all the preparations exciting. The first half of the book largely focused on the life of the woman setting up the hotel, and it was enjoyable. However, the book became very boring once the hotel was established. During the second half of the book, each chapter focused on a new character or characters, and their story that brought them to the hotel, and a sort of redemption from the time spent in Ireland during their week stay. It felt like a book of short stories. It also seemed a little shallow and forced when person after person had some major life problem when they arrived at the hotel, which was then resolved during their stay. My biggest disappointment though was that the book ended after the last character's story. I had hoped that stories would be revisited at the end and the story would circle back to characters, but that never happened. The end result was that I felt like I bonded with no one. The book is a light-hearted, warm read and could be nice as a vacation book, but I was generally not very impressed."}, {"userName": "Sharon Chance", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2579638-sharon-chance", "userReview": "The literary world took a huge hit when it lost one of Ireland\u2019s best and most beloved authors, Maeve Binchy, last year. But one shining light was that Maeve had completed her final novel, \u201cA Week In Winter,\u201d before her death, and what a beautiful tribute to this amazing author this final book is.In her brilliant way of spinning a story, Maeve takes her readers to the west coast of Ireland to the village of Stoneybridge where hometown girl Chicky Starr has returned home to open a holiday hotel. As the story opens, readers are welcomed into the life of Chicky and the people who are helping her making her dream of creating a place of rest for others possible. There is Rigger, the bad boy who turns out to become a good man; Orla, Chicky\u2019s niece, who is brilliant with figures and computer skills; and Miss Queenie, the matriarch of the house who spread her delighted joy in all the proceedings.But it\u2019s the guests who make their way to Stone House for its first week of business who make this story sing. John, the American movie star who is incognito; Winnie and her future mother-in-law Lillian (if they don\u2019t kill each other first); Anders, the Dutch businessman who is facing a crossroads in his life; the Walls, the prize-winning couple who aren\u2019t too pleased with their prize; Freda, the psychic librarian; and Miss Nell Howe, the most unpleasant retired school headmistress anyone has ever met. It\u2019s this group of people and their individual stories that give the warmth and compassion that Maeve Binchy\u2019s books are so famous for. There are even references to a few of the other characters from Maeve\u2019s previous novels that make an appearance, although brief, in this tale. The setting of the book is inspiring, the characters are personable and real, and the story flows from one chapter to another with such ease that it is a joy to read.If an author\u2019s life can have a cherry-on-top at the end of their life\u2019s work, then \u201cA Week In Winter\u201d is certainly Maeve Binchy\u2019s cherry!"}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "This book is decidedly cozy. I am not saying that as a bad thing, not remotely. What saves it is that it is not saccharine. Cozy, but not sickly sweet. Neither is it a challenging read, nor are there ideas that will occupy your brain for days, just a belief that taking time for yourself, in pleasant surroundings, surrounded by people who genuinely like people and take care of each other, in a gorgeous setting, is good for the soul.It is not hard to convince me of this.

She's my writer hero and two of my high moments as a writer were having one of my Irish trilogy books appear in a display with her in the Shannon airport duty free shop, and last summer appearing on the New York Times bestseller list with her. Even with her weaker books (and this one wasn't), she's a better storyteller than most writers out there. Which, along with the fact that she kept me totally engaged and turning the pages, is why I gave A Week in Winter five stars.  One odd note, to me, was that the book seemed about 85% narrative. It worked for her voice, as if she was sitting across a table in an Irish pub, telling me the story over a foam-topped pint in front of a turf fire. And, as I said, I kept turning pages to find out what happened. But since books, at least in America, are so dialogue heavy these days, I couldn't help noticing it. There was something else niggling me about the story that I didn't figure out until I puzzled on it a few days after finishing the book. All the guests who arrive at the guest house the main character has restored have their stories told in a few chapters. Then there are a few scenes where they all are shown having dinner together, but Binchy could have switched all those chapters around and it wouldn't have made a difference because they were more like short stories woven together by putting the characters in the same house at the same time. Not that it didn't work. It did. But it wasn't a format most readers have come to expect from a novel. The worst part was getting to that last page and realizing it was the last new Binchy book I'd ever read."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4725799-dana", "userReview": "A Week in Winter- Maeve Binchy's posthumous novel is achingly beautiful, so well written, a gift to any reader, and a sad goodbye to one of the world's most talented writers. Binchy has always held her readers gently in her grasp, telling them stories of people and places that capture our interest from the first few lines, and keep us fixated on her tales til the last page. I could not put this one down, and yet I dreaded finishing it, knowing there will be no more novels to follow. Binchy finished this one last summer, and then died, unexpectedly, a few weeks later. Each chapter is connected to the others, yet concentrates on the life of a different character, all of whom end up, in some capacity, whether as owner, staff or guest at Stone House, an old home, turned bed & breakfast, set high atop a cliff in small town Ireland, far from the bustling life in Dublin. Brothers and sisters, husbands & wives, children, friends, lovers and scoundrels all fill the pages to keep us glued to the words until the book is closed, and the story becomes a happy memory. Every character has some adversity to overcome (don't we all?) and most have love to give. I envy anyone who has not yet read this novel, because so much joy and beauty awaits them. There are not enough stars for me to give to A Week in Winter. Binchy has never disappointed me, from her first, Light a Penny Candle, which I remember reading in my 20's, in 1982, until the last sentence in her final novel. I remember saying something similar in 2010 when I finished reading Minding Frankie. Binchy just \"gets\" people, and always makes me yearn for hot tea, a roaring fire, and a cat in my lap."}, {"userName": "Danette", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2149077-danette", "userReview": "So bittersweet to finish this Maeve Binchy book, knowing that there will be no more. Once again, it felt like coming home! Love all of the characters presented in this book, all of them traveling to Stoneybridge to either work or stay at Stone House. I think that if you want to read this book, you should first make sure that you've read many books she has written before, because old characters are mentioned, places are returned to, and it just gives that much more pleasure! So if you want to read this, go back and read her earlier works, including Quentin's, Heart and Soul, Minding Frankie, and maybe others. They're all so good anyway. Ah.

He convinces her to leave Stoneybridge in Ireland and come to New York with him, promising that they will always be together. Forever turns out to be a couple of months. Chicky is left alone in New York with no friends and no job. Luckily she finds work at Mrs. Cassiday's boarding house. Chicky doesn't want to go home and confess what a mess her life turned out to be, but Mrs. Cassiday finally convinces her and to her amazement, she loves being back. She loves it so much that she makes arrangements to buy Stone House from Miss Queenie Sheedy. Thus starts the plan to turn Stone House into a select hotel. This is a delightful, sunny story that makes you feel good inside just reading about Stone House and all the marvelous characters, guests and staff, that help to make the hotel a reality. The book is actually a series of short stories all tied together by the theme of preparing Stone House to become a hotel and welcome guests. Each story is complete, but they build on each other to compose the picture of the hotel and its guests. I highly recommend this book if you're a fan of Maeve Binchy, or if you just want to curl up and take a journey of the imagination to Stone House on the coast of Ireland. I reviewed this book for the Amazon Vine Program."}, {"userName": "Nuala  Reilly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15053480-nuala-reilly", "userReview": "As posted on my blog: http://nualareilly.wordpress.com/2013...It was in my stocking Christmas morning.Maeve Binchy\u2019s last book; A Week in Winter.I have mentioned before how much I loved her work. How much I identified with her characters and how reading her books made me feel like I was sitting down with old friends. Something about her words touched me in a way few other books do, and, like many of her fans, I have read (and own) every single book she ever wrote. When she died a few months ago, I actually cried. It felt like I had lost a friend.And then the news: Maeve had written one more book and her editor was finishing up the last polish on it and was going to release it.A Week in Winter is written in a style that Maeve was fond of in almost half of her books. We get the general idea of the story, and then she dedicates a chapter to each key character and tells us how they came to be a part of the story at large. This way we get a novel, but buried in it are several short stories and Maeve is still the queen of making me fall in love with a character in just a few short pages. Plus, her last book has a Nuala in it, so how could I not love it?I was reluctant to start it at first. My husband commented that he was surprised that I didn\u2019t rip into it immediately, but starting this book was bitter sweet for me, since it was the last new book of hers I would ever read. Eventually though, I did pick it up, crack the pristine spine, and begin to read.This time Maeve took us to the West of Ireland, which I loved, since that is the part of my father\u2019s homeland that I fell in love with when I was there two years ago. A small seaside town where people lived modest lives. Where young Chicky (as she is called) \u2018disgraces\u2019 her family by falling in love with an American visitor and running away with him to New York. To save face with her family and preserve her (and their honour) she invents, through her letters home, a marriage to him and a life very different from the bohemian one she is living.Alas, as happens, the romance fizzles out, but Chicky, not wanting to go home in shame, carries on living her life in New York and keeping up the lie of her life with yearly visits home and letters.Back in her hometown, the three Sheedy sisters who owned and lived in the large house on the hill begin to die. When the last Sheedy sister is left and with Chicky in town on a visit, the ladies strike a bargain to turn the grand home into a hotel and for Chicky to come home and run it. Her lover long gone, Chicky invents a tragic accident to her family, embraces life as a fictional widow and embarks on a journey to change her fate.As the first opening week approaches, Chicky is nervous of getting the hotel off to a good start. It\u2019s hard to promote a Winter vacation in a seaside place, but she manages to fill the rooms.Not wanting to spoil all the stories, I will tell you that the rest of the book goes into the lives of all the visitors in that first week of the hotel being open.With no surprise, Maeve delves into the lives of these people with a grace and warmth that holds my attention and makes me want to meet them, be a visitor at that table in the dining room and hear the laughter and conversation that happens over the lovingly cooked meals. She makes me want to walk the cliff paths she describes, play with the baby twins and sit in the Sheedy sitting room with a hot cuppa tea and the fire roaring beside me.I finished the book in less than a day, and, as happens when I close the back cover on one of her stories, I was sad to end it. Though, like most of her books, I know that I will pick it up again and again as the years go on and slip comfortably back into her characters like a pair of well worn slippers, the contours of which fit me so exactly its like they were made solely for me.Thank you Maeve, for leaving us with this sweet parting gift. Your words will ever be a song in my heart."}, {"userName": "\u2728Susan\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21276121-susan", "userReview": "This was a great cozy. I love how MB can creat such ingenious characters that really stick with you. This story is a walk through the lives and backgrounds of a group of people who have never met and are from different places in the world. One week they all end up at a magical bed and breakfast. Not a paranormal place, just a place where it's history creates a sense and environment prone to heeling. MB makes it easy to get to know, care about and take journeys with all her wonderful characters. Fantastic picturesque scenery settings of the Irish coast helped bring long walks and cave adventures to life.

Curling up with a Maeve Binchy novel is a bit like snuggling up on a cold winter's night with a big mug of hot chocolate. Like the chocolate, you never want the book to end, yet you cannot put it down until you do so. She gently pulls you into the plotline, introducing the characters one by one, each with their own agenda. The focal point in 'A Week in Winter' is Stone House, a newly-opened hotel, a project for Chicky, the central character, who carries a secret. The characters, from all walks of life, come together, ultimately finding things out about themselves and each other. A wonderful, warming descriptive narrative from the lovely Maeve, sadly no longer with us."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1403446-sue", "userReview": "Notification from Goodreads that this book was published landed in my email box November 3, 2012. I didn't realize that Binchy had a book remaining to be published when she died in August, but it's very possible since the time from author completion to publication can be lengthy. What was more interesting to me is that the person who wrote the synopsis of the book for Goodreads did not include the fact that this book is being published posthumously.

It was told only as Maeve Binchy could tell a story, in such a way that I was glad I didn't miss this last of her stories. And it confirmed something in me that I suspected was true.

Written more like a series of novellas than one long novel, this book deals with the different people who will eventually either work at Stone House or stay there for the inaugural week in the winter.This book was written with Ms Binchy\u2019s usual style and grace. The story is a bit of a typical one for the author, as she had been known to do lovely things with words and writing about people going through hard times and seeing the hope at the end of the tunnel.The varieties of people who will be making up the visitors to the Inn are eclectic indeed and entirely entertaining. With each story being different yet part of a whole, the reader will never get bored or overly annoyed with a character they did not like.

Knowing that it was the last Maeve Binchy book made me a little melancholy before I even started reading, and a book set on the rocky and stormy Atlantic coast of Ireland will have plenty of melancholy already! I love books set in Ireland, and while this one offered no surprises to fans of Maeve Binchy, it transported me to Stone House, an inn opened by Chicky Starr with the help of Riggy (a troubled young man who needs to find his way) and Orla (Chicky\u2019s niece trying to find her place). Separate chapters focus on each of these characters as well as an American actor who ends up there on a whim, a couple of doctors that are trying to recover from the tragedies they\u2019ve witnessed, a psychic librarian, a cantankerous school principal, a Swede torn between family duty and his love of music, a young girl and her not-happy future mother-in-law, and a prize-winning couple. Each has a different story and separate reasons for being at Stone House, where they will hopefully (mostly) find hope and a way forward in their lives. Unfortunately, Maeve Binchy did not get a chance to finish editing the book before her death, and in places, it shows. There are several awkward transitions, some characters that are not as well-developed as in her previous works, and some storylines that seem to be left unfinished.

The stories are pretty predictable with no real depth to them and the characters are quite bland and I could not really gel or care about any of them. I felt the writing was hurried and the novel concluded with the all problems solved. Just a bit too twee for my liking.It is certainly readable and I found myself plodding along with each chapter but for me this is not a book that will stay with me and I don\u2019t think it will make a good book club read as discussion would be pretty limited.I have enjoyed previous books by Maeve Binchy but this one is really not up to her normal standards.

I am not a fan of short stories normally and this book does have a little of that feel but in each segment the other characters are all woven in. Each chapter focuses on a certain guest, giving a \"history\" of sorts and how they ended up at stone house but as the chapter progresses, the other guests are brought in. I did think though that at some point chicky's secret about Walter would be revealed, although I am glad it wasn't. I have always wanted to go to Ireland, and stone house sounded like a place I would love to get away to. I did really enjoy this last book of hers, not as much as some of her earlier works like Tara road (which started me reading her books) and circle of friends and others that I found amazing.

Anyways...this was a cute little jem to find. I just found out she passed in 2012 and this was her last book as well. I am honored to have read a pretty decent read from an obviously very talented author. And to be honest this book didn't have the drama that keeps me interested in reading so I wasn't sure how I was going to like it. But her wonderful storytelling and the way the Irish Seaside came to life through her words was enough to keep me hooked. I really enjoyed reading about each characters lives, hopes, and struggles. Each character has their own story but they are all intertwined with their stay at Stone House. And I liked each and every character, well almost every, Miss Howe was just to extremely unhappy. Each one has an inner turmoil that has brought them to the beautiful Irish Coast to reflect. It was really a treat to get a look at so many people's lives in one book and feel an attachment to each story. Sometimes with multiple characters it can get a bit overwhelming but it was not the case with this book. Ms. Binchy does such a good job with each story.The only downside was the way the book ended to me. It was a let down after all the wonderful stories how the book concluded. It felt rushed and incomplete... I guess I was expecting a bigger better ending. And some closure for certain characters in particular. Anyways this really was a good book for anyone who likes to read about different cultures, a good general fiction/women's fiction book, or even short stories, because each story is kind of like a short story all wrapped up in bigger story.

That is not the case in this book. It's like Binchey waved a magic wand and sprinkled a writer's fairy dust on it while she wrote. I thought her last few ones had been a little weak but this one makes up for those. Binchey likes to intertwine characters from other novels into the new ones but this one is relatively sparse of connections. The characters eat at Quinns and there is some mention of the heart clinic but this is, basically, a clean slate of people to meet and enjoy.Chicky Starr returns to Western Ireland after a 20 year stay in New York. She buys an old neighbor manor house and restores it to its original elegance and converts it into a holiday place for those whose spirits need rejuvenating. She adds a small group of helpers whose lives are changed in the renovation. The old spinster who owned the house is swept along and enjoys the time of her life. A young boy headed for delinquency has his life changed. When the guests arrive for the opening, they too have problems that need resolution. And in the peace and quiet of Stone House, find the resolution they need. As the waves crash on the shore, people reevaluate their lives and allow a little pixie dust to create small miracles.Binchey's stories were my introduction to Ireland. I always wanted to find these little towns where people loved their land and were so welcoming. These towns had people who were so interesting that you felt like you could walk into their houses, sit down and have a conversation. They were so real. It was Binchey's genius that she made the setting and the people so realistic that you felt like you could reach out and touch them.If you liked Binchey's writing, you will like this book.

The first I've ever read by Binchy, but based on this, probably not the last, especially since her long time fans seem to indicate that this is not the best. Great characters, very little plot. The novel is organized around one Chicky Starr, and her efforts to restore an old estate and convert it into a full service inn. The first third or so is devoted to meeting Chicky and the small community of Stoneybridge on the west coast of Ireland. The balance of the book is developing the backstories, joys, and heartbreaks of two sets of characters: those who work at Stone House and the set of guests who come there in its first week of operation.While the setting and the cultures are very different, this nonetheless reminded me very much of the Ladies No. 1 Detective series. The same gentle and mostly kind observations about people that serve to remind us of our similarities as human beings, and how petty are most of the things that divide us. Not to overlook or downplay the petty, but just to serve as reminders that very few of us are perfect.A good read for anyone who wants a bit of light and kindness, triumph over adversity, and a protagonist who shows us what true strength is, and what community is all about."}, {"userName": "Nancy Steinle gummel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12968957-nancy-steinle-gummel", "userReview": "A Week in Winter by Maeve Binchy is another superb story telling by Maeve Binchy.

But, it's sad to read such a beautiful book by an author who is no longer with us. Binchy is able to bring a character to life in just one chapter. This one is a fitting final book.Stonybridge is a small village on the west coast of Ireland. It's a typical village in that the young people yearn to leave. Chicky Ryan was no different, and, against her parents' wishes, she took up with an American named Walter Starr, and went with him to New York City. But, Walter proved to be a dreamer who finally moved on, while Chicky was the one working for a living. As a dutiful daughter, though, she returned home to Stonybridge once a year, spinning a story about her marriage to Walter, and his subsequent death in a car accident. And, finally, Chicky Starr returned to the village with a plan. She bought an old mansion on the cliffs from the last of the three Sheedy sisters, Miss Queenie. Miss Queenie would continue to live there while Chicky turned the old house into a restful place for a holiday by the sea.And, Chicky finds the perfect people to help her. Rigger, a young teenage delinquent, is sent away from Dublin in disgrace, to try his hand working at Stone House. Chicky's niece, Orla, is a whiz at business, and she's asked to come home for a year to get the hotel off the ground. Once this unlikely group is ready, along with a small cat named Gloria, they welcome the first guests for A Week in Winter.I had forgotten how beautifully Binchy developed characters. She reveals the entire lives of Chicky, Rigger, and Orla in the opening chapters. And, then one by one, she tells the stories of the guests who come to the hotel, needy people who don't know they'll find rest and answers at the Stone House in Stoneybridge. Binchy reveals family connections and buried secrets and hurts. And, there are wise women to help each of them, beginning with Chicky and the women she surrounded herself with, Orla and Rigger's young wife. The Stone House is filled with a warmth and compassion that eases the pain for most of the guests. And, the story itself is filled with warmth and fascinating lives of an actor, two doctors, a Swede who yearns for music in his life, a couple filled with resentment, two women stuck together by their mutual love of a man, a librarian, and a retired headmistress.Chicky Starr changed lives, beginning with her own and Miss Queenie's. When Binchy leaves Chicky waiting for her next group of guests, it's hard for the reader to leave Stone House, and Maeve Binchy's writing, behind. The Irish landscape, the inside of Stone House, and the people themselves are so finely described it seems effortless. It's obvious that A Week in Winter was a labor of love, a last gift from a beloved author to her readers. It's a warm, comfortable last book, one that readers will remember with fondness."}, {"userName": "Ivonne Rovira", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3803671-ivonne-rovira", "userReview": "My sister-in-law Jane always knows best. You can just ask her! All joshing aside, Jane has been literally telling me for years that I needed to read Maeve Binchy. She couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t read one of her works already! But I always had so much to read, so I put it off. And off. And off. Until a colleague at work got me A Week in Winter.OK, Jane. You\u2019re right. Again.Free spirit Geraldine \u201cChicky\u201d Ryan runs away from Ireland\u2019s backward and provincial West of Ireland with a fellow free spirit, handsome American Walter Starr, much to the consternation of Chicky\u2019s hard-scrabble farming family and Walter\u2019s patrician family. In New York City, Chicky and Walter live in a commune apartment, and she maintains a cordial, weekly letter-exchange with family and friends in the village of Stoneybridge. But when restless Walter proves to be a little too free and decides to move on, Chicky needs to decide what to do. She\u2019s determined never to return to judgmental Stoneybridge and her disapproving family. For years, she lives one life in New York and reports a more successful, exciting life to those left behind in Stoneybridge. But in the end, at middle age, Chicky returns \u2014 but not as a sorrowful penitent \u2014 but as a returning conqueror, someone who turns the crumbling Sheedy mansion, Stone House, into a one-of-a-kind seaside hotel. Assisted by Miss Queenie Sheedy, Chicky\u2019s bright and business-savvy niece Orla, and Richard (nicknamed \u201cRigger\u201d), the wayward illegitimate son of Chicky\u2019s old friend Nuala, clever Chicky transforms not just broken-down Stone House but the broken spirits who pass through. Despite the bracing wind (read: \u201cfreezing blasts of air\u201d) in the west of Ireland, Binchy made me long to spend a week in such a restorative home under the guidance of the generous Chicky Starr. And for a sun worshipper like me, someone who develops gooseflesh at the grocery store in August, that\u2019s really saying something.Those lucky enough to read the audio version will find that reader Rosalyn Landor a right treat, as the Irish say.And, Jane, I hope all is forgiven. A Week in Winter won\u2019t be my last Maeve Binchy. You were right \u2014 as usual."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9160546-anna", "userReview": "As soon as this book was released, I was itching to buy it, but restrained myself as I knew Christmas was coming. Once again, my daughters did not disappoint and I awoke to find this final Maeve Binchy book under the tree for me. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and was only disappointed because it ended. I did feel that there were perhaps a few minor unfinished issues, but perhaps that is a metaphor for life. Not everyone ends up happy with all their problems solved; there are always unfinished issues. I really enjoyed the times spent at the big house on the coast, and reading about this wild part of Ireland made me want to go there all the more. I thought the characters were well rounded, and I had a clear photo in my mind of each of them as I read about them in their designated chapters. I enjoy books formatted like this, and when I read about a previous chapter's character from a different viewpoint, I think,\"oh yes I know her/him, I've met them before.\"Now that I have read all of Maeve's books, and the fact that there won't be any more, I may just have to go back and start all over again, perhaps with Firefly Summer which was the one that started my love affair with her writing. Rest in peace, sweet Maeve, and thank you!"}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28497722-jess", "userReview": "I can check off Maeve Binchy from the \"Authors I've Been Meaning to Try\" list. I see her books in supermarkets, library book sales, most garage sales, and pretty much every used bookstore. To my judging mind that equals that this author must be kind of prolific if her stuff pops up in most places where I see books in the wild-meaning not an actual buy new bookstore. I'm sure my judgement scale is highly scientific... anyhooo.. I don't think she's for me.  The premise of this book having a woman with a past buy and restore a brick house on the cliffs of Ireland near the Atlantic ocean is a lovely one. I love chick lit books like that. Breaking each chapter up from the point of view of staff person and the opening week guests was quite interesting. I just couldn't love this book or Binchy's style of storytelling. For starters: -(my biggest annoyance) do women not know the concept of birth control? There are three (yeah.. THREE) women characters mentioned in this book that have unplanned pregnancies. All three are teenage- meaning 17-18 years of age. One involves a summer fling from the male participant, another involves a marriage, and the third doesn't really explain what happened to the male. My overall impression was \"WTH\". Birth control isn't complicated and to have three of your characters experience the unplanned effects of \"being in love\" is kind of irresponsible, lazy plot creation, and just odd. This could be my ignorance speaking though... maybe teenage pregnancy was an issue in Ireland from 1960-1990s? -towards the end it becomes rather hodgepodge. Stories start to blur and I was left wondering what is the point Binchy is trying to make. It starts to ramble; which leaves me wishing \"Wrap it up already\" but when you have no idea what the point is... you have no idea how she is going to wrap up a pointless story. I feel like that is the beginning of some philosophical debate?-incredibly predictable. Sometimes the reader can take comfort in predictability. I think that is one reason we love \"easy\" reads. We want that comfort, enjoyment, and steadiness. It didn't start out as a predictable story. There are a few plot points that were novel and that is what kept my interest. However, two thirds of the way through, it was pretty apparent where she was heading with every guest narrated chapter. -the scenery is lovely. The descriptions of the house make me wish it did exist. -the idea that spending a week on the coast of Ireland in this house will bring clarity, rest, and perhaps a solving of your life problem is an attractive one. That's a piece of fiction I wish was a reality in this world. -I'm glad I gave it a go. I can say I tried it out and it just isn't the genre for me."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "I loved this book so much.

Though I am very aware of who Maeve Binchy was, I have only read a couple of her other novels--CIRCLE OF FRIENDS and TARA ROAD. I enjoyed both of them a great deal, even if I did find that the author depended a little heavily on co-incidence and happenstance. I chalked it up to a sprinkle of Irish magic. A WEEK IN WINTER, however, stretched my suspension of disbelief too far.The problem for me began with the protagonist Chicky Starr. As a young woman she flees Ireland with a dreamy American, who soon leaves her to fend for herself. She's so hurt and embarrassed that she lies to her relatives back home, telling them first that the couple has married and, later, that her husband has been killed in a tragic accident. Chicky returns to Ireland once a year to stay at a decaying mansion. Eventually, she buys the property and turns it into a guest house. Chicky's long and involved back story covers about twenty years and the first 20% of the novel. The balance of the book delves into the lives of the people who come to work for Chicky and the guests who stay for Stone House's opening weekend.Somehow the right people know the right people who connect with the right people, so that each of these troubled characters comes to Stone House where their lives are transformed. Ne'er-do-well teens become fantastic husbands-fathers-handymen. Enemies become friends. The hopelessly lost find themselves. In reality, the complications any one of these characters face could form the plot of a full length book. Squeezed into \"their\" (each chapter is named for the character whose story it tells) few pages, they can't be fully realized by the writer or fully appreciated by the reader. These \"Reader's Digest condensed\" plotlines left me dissatisfied and wanting more.In spite of the problems I had with the book, I did enjoy the world Binchy created. I just wish she'd allowed me to savor it."}], "description": "Stoneybridge is a small town on the west coast of Ireland where all the families know one another.
