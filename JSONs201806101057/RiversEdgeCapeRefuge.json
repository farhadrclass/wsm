I loved being back in Cape Refuge and meeting back up with familiar characters, and getting to know some new ones.I felt the subject of infertility was handled very sensitively, portraying well the feelings of those who go through this.The subject of physics and what the Bible has to say about them, and how they can affect us was also dealt with well. It was well played out through the characters. I was a bit nervous to start with when the subject came up in the story wondering where the author was going with the story line, but I soon relaxed as the story unfolded.

She feels that her books are her ministry. Sometimes when I read this type of book, I find the author very preachy, but she strikes a nice balance between an interesting story and sharing her beliefs.This story is the third book in the Cape Refuge series. This fictitious island off Georgia's coast has seen a surge of murders recently. Police Chief Cade is now on the hot seat as the mayor's race heats up. Two of the candidates (Ben and Sam)don't think he is doing a good job and would love to get rid of him. It's only long time friend, Jonathan, who is also a mayoral candidate who continues to believe in him.When Ben's wife disappears and is found murdered, the pressure is on to find the killer before he strikes again. Rumors are flying that Ben was having an affair. Perhaps he or his mistress were behind Lisa's murder? Rounding out the cast is Blair, who recently bought the island newspaper, her sister Morgan who desperately wants a baby, a psychic, a tabloid reporter, and the residents of Hanover House who are trying to put their lives back together again."}, {"userName": "Randy Tramp", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21953550-randy-tramp", "userReview": "Ben Johnson's wife is missing.

I do think that her more recent books are my favorite and a bit more suspenseful but this is still a great series. That being said this book is centered around infertility in every way. It was interesting to read about and get into the emotions of the characters. The murder is to a woman named Lisa who has been trying for years to have a child. Add some politics, shady business owners, and media and you have yourself a puzzle. I really like Cade, the man who looks into each murder in each book. He is a great character and it's nice to see how his life progresses throughout the series. I do recommend reading these books in order as the characters and parts of the storyline do flow in each of them. I really liked this book and the way the author tries to mess with the reader's mind. There is also a huge message on living a Christian life in a bit of a side story.

As usual I was kept in suspense throughout the whole story not even realizing who the killer was until the last chapter. Blackstock gives a testimony at the end of the book on her style of writing. No matter how much she mentions her writing, she always gives praise to the Bible and mentions how her books could not even approach the glory of the Bible. She praises the Word of God.

It is realistic and the characters are people who will draw you into the story and make you care about them from page one. The suspense of who killed Lisa Jackson will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end, and there are enough suspects to keep you guessing. I love to read suspenseful novels and try to solve the crime and figure out who the guilty party is before it is revealed, but Terri Blackstock in the Cape Refuge series (the two that I have read so far) always surprises me, and to me, that says the author did a great job with the story because it was intricately woven in a way that I thought I knew who dunnit, but I didn\u2019t.This series also includes a recurring group of townsfolk who keep you coming back to each book of the series. Their storylines include suspense and romance as well as real-life issues. Blair Owens\u2019s walk of faith is a joy to watch as it grows and she faces some of the spiritual struggles we all deal with.I would recommend this novel to anyone who loves a well-written story about realistic characters dealing with realistic issues. I also recommend this novel to anyone who loves a fast-paced suspense novel, as well as a mystery that keeps you guessing until the very end."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44386577-lauren", "userReview": "I'm still hooked on this series, and if your reading them you know why...We open this book with one of Jonathon's opponents in the race for mayor with a missing wife.

And what an introduction it is. Ms. Blackstock makes us hit the ground running and just does not let up with the suspense. Politics, infertility, missing wife and a psychic all this and more rolled up into one storyline. I think it takes a highly skilled author to pull of something like this and let me tell you I think Ms. Blackstock is one highly skilled author. Blair Owens and Police Chief Cade are well-defined characters that know what they are doing and whom we root for to figure out just what is going on. Once the action gets going Ms. Blackstock revs up the thriller quotient considerably which will have you reading and flipping pages as fast as you can.

She writes a decent mystery and the ending is brilliant, but her characterizations occasionally fall flat. Morgan really annoyed me in this book, because she behaves as a super-Christian with no faults at all. She's totally emotion-driven and apparently doesn't understand the basics of logic or reasoning. Not all Christians are like that. Meanwhile, her sister Blair (a better overall character) has taken over the newspaper and is writing about the murder of a prominent local politician's wife, but this causes her to clash occasionally with Matthew Cade, the police chief and the man she's deeply in love with. There's a subplot about IVF and infertility that involves Morgan and her husband, which bored me since I had two kids the good old-fashioned way (and I have married friends who are childfree). I have never understood women and men who put having a baby as the be-all, end-all of their lives. I certainly don't know any Christians who think that way. Some Christians deliberately decide to forsake having children in order to share in missionary work, but Morgan's job on this earth is, apparently, to be a mother. At several points in the book, I wanted to reach into the pages and slap her. Sheila Caruso is another fairly well developed character. She's a reformed (?) drug addict who's released from prison early and is attempting to start a new life at Hanover House with her children, Sadie and Caleb. She behaves in a fairly predictable manner, but she's at least realistic. The book is far more plot-driven than message-driven, but there is good counsel on why Christians avoid psychics and mediums and what it means to engage in spiritual warfare with the weaponry Paul described in Ephesians. All in all, a satisfying read.\""}, {"userName": "Julia Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29770295-julia-wilson", "userReview": "River's Edge by Terri Blackstock is book number 3 in the Cape Refuge series.

The murder mystery sucked me in and held my attention until the very end. I guessed and guessed, but still, the ending surprised me - in a good, satisfying way, of course.

Being the 3rd book in the Cape Refuge series, there's already been a foundation laid for the story and there are quite a few references to things that happened in the first 2 books. It's definitely not a stand-alone book. If you haven't read the first 2, then don't read this one yet, because you'll miss a lot.I really enjoyed reading about Blair's growth from rejecting God to accepting Him and learning more about Him. I also liked Cade's willingness to hold off on a relationship with Blair while trusting God to bring her to Him rather than rushing into a relationship and hoping that he could change her himself.The struggles Morgan and Sheila went through were pretty awful. No matter which situation you were in, it would be really hard to do what was right and what needed to be done. I loved the way the relationship between the two of them turned out. :)As for the killer... I usually either figure it out or have a pretty good idea who the guilty party is; but this time, I was pretty surprised and had no clue until the characters in the book figured it out.Really enjoyable read! And now I'm off to get my hands on book 4 in the Cape Refuge Series: Breaker's Reef. :)"}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7092147-nancy", "userReview": "A Mayoral Race Upset by MurderIn the third book in the Cape Refuge Series, Morgan and Jonathan are still running Hanover House, a transitional facility for drug offenders. To complicate their lives, Jonathan is running for mayor and they are trying to have a baby, but with little success. Morgan is drawn to Lisa, wife of another mayoral candidate because they both have fertility problems. When Lisa disappears, the investigation centers on her husband. The evidence is there, but Chief of Police Cade, has trouble believing that her devoted husband would kill her. The characters are believable. Morgan and Jonathan are the kind of sympathetic people that make running a transition house work. Their problems are something many people can relate to: the rigors of a campaign, and the heartbreak of being unable to conceive a child. It may surprise readers new to Cape Refuge that the book is not only a murder mystery, but also a portrayal of Christian values. Blackstock isn't too heavy handed with her Christian message, but the ideals of family and helping others are well illustrated by the way Morgan and Jonathan run Hanover House.I recommend this book if you like a mystery with a twist at the end that is relatively free of violence. I reviewed this book for BookLook Bloggers."}, {"userName": "Simran Pahwa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22042857-simran-pahwa", "userReview": "This novel is the third novel in the Cape Refuge series. Now, although I haven\u2019t read the first two novels in this series (Cape Refuge & Southern Storm), it wasn\u2019t as confusing as I thought it would be! There were some areas of the book where I was kind of confused as to what was going on, but I guess that would be my fault for not realizing that I had ordered the third book rather than the first! Anyway, moving onto the review. This novel revolves around a series of murders that begin to unravel after the disappearance of Lisa Jackson, wife of one of the major competitors in the mayoral race. River\u2019s Edge has the perfect combination of romance, suspense, and fraud, which makes this novel a very easy read, at only 360 pages! I was given this novel by BookLook Bloggers to review. I enjoyed it and I didn't put it down until it was finished! Great novel! It was very religious based, which i think kind of took away from the novel a bit. But still, I look forward to reading Breaker\u2019s Reef, the last novel in this series! I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone who's into Suspense/Christian Fiction."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/333533-andrea", "userReview": "My library went to the effort of getting the rest of the books in this series for me, so I feel obligated to finish them, but I have to say that the series isn't living up to my expectations. First, for a town whose typical crime is parking violations, there sure have been a lot of murders. I think I'd be packing up and moving. And, what is the deal with Blair and Cade? It seemed like they were together at the end of the first book. Then, the whole second book was about them getting together (well, it was about a lot of other things, but their \"relationship\" dragged on throughout). Then, same thing in the third book. They're probably still not really together in the last book of the series either.There were several \"spiritual\" parts that dragged on, and seemed to detract from the rest of the story. It's hard to explain, but sometimes an author can integrate that sort of thing very well and keep with the flow of the story. Wasn't working smoothly in this one.Those things aside, the story is pretty interesting. I had some suspicions about the bad guy, but was glad that I wasn't right on (who likes a really obvious story?)."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9326804-mary", "userReview": "In a world gone crazy with tragedy\u2014the Boston bombing, the West, Texas explosion, a friend forced to invite Hospice into her home\u2014turning to a good novel can be an escape of a necessary kind. My reading style allows background noise. So Thursday, I set the TV to breaking news and settled down with a novel that\u2019s been waiting for just such a week. River\u2019s Edge by Terri Blackstock, the 3rd in her Cape Refuge series, was perfect. I plunged into life in Blackstock\u2019s island town of Cape Refuge: Morgan agonizing over her miscarriage; Blair searching for stories for her thrice weekly newspaper issues; Jonathan running for mayor to save friend Cade\u2019s job as police chief. And amid all that, a murder . . . Blair probes into the mystery and turns up clues. But her new love interest, the police chief, feels that her headlines make him look incompetent and threaten his slender hold on his job.Taking a break from reading to check on Boston news, I saw reporters facing Blair\u2019s dilemma. They wanted to fully inform the public (me) but had a responsibility to the police authorities. Airing too much information might jeopardize their search for the bomber(s)."}], "description": "The man Lisa Jackson loved most may have betrayed her. Another used deception to manipulate her. But did one of them kill her? Ben Jackson is sure to defeat Jonathan Cleary in Cape Refuge\u2019s mayoral race, until his wife turns up missing the day before a major debate. Suspecting foul play, Police Chief Cade launches an island-wide search. But it takes a psychic\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d to point police to the riverside\u2014and Lisa\u2019s body. The evidence implicating Ben in his wife\u2019s murder is convincing. But as a local scandal escalates into a national media circus, Cade\u2019s instincts tell him to dig deeper. And he\u2019s not the only one. Blair Owens of the Cape Refuge Journal is using her investigative skills to uncover a rat\u2019s nest of dirty secrets\u2014and more than one person with a motive for murder. But Blair\u2019s methods are jeopardizing her relationship with Cade, and an unsolicited prediction from the psychic only adds to her troubles. Is the man\u2019s so-called gift truly from God, as he claims? Did Lisa\u2019s murder have anything to do with the mayoral race, her husband\u2019s alleged affair, or her decade-long struggle with infertility? Whoever the killer is, he\u2019s about to take his evasion of justice to the next, lethal level.
