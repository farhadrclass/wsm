It is autobiographical and the main character is called Christopher Isherwood. It describes Isherwood\u2019s time as a screenwriter on the film Little Friend in 1934. The central character is a film director Friedrich Bergmann (based on Berthold Viertel). It is set at the time of the rise of Nazism, just before the Anschluss; Bergmann is an Austrian Jew. It is a satire of the film industry, but it also depicts a time and place and captures the general indifference to the rise of Nazism. Isherwood explores the tension between creative artists and the insidiousness of commerce. Friedrich Bergmann is the stand out character, dominating the novella, a typical demanding and outrageous director; often self-important and unpredictable, but also charming and generous. Bergmann\u2019s family are in Austria and this adds to the tension. The ongoing human tendency to avoid reality is at the centre. But for Isherwood the future was clear:\u201cLike all my friends I believed a European war was coming soon. I believed as one believes one will die \u2026 It was unreal because I couldn\u2019t imagine anything beyond it; I refused to imagine anything: just as a spectator refuse to imagine what is behind the scenery in the theatre, The outbreak of war, like the moment of death crossed my perspective of the future like a wall; it marked the instant, total end of my imagined world.\u201dIsherwood\u2019s description of life in a film studio is also telling;\"It will interest you, as a phenomenon. You see, the film studio of today is really the palace of the sixteenth century. There one sees what Shakespeare saw: the absolute power of the tyrant, the courtiers, the flatterers, the jesters, the cunningly ambitious intriguers. There are fantastically beautiful women, there are incompetent favourites. There are great men who are suddenly disgraced. There is a most insane extravagance, and unexpected parsimony over a few pence. There is enormous splendour, which is a sham; and also horrible squalor hidden behind the scenery. There are vast schemes, abandoned because of some caprice. There are secrets which everybody knows and no one speaks of. There are even one or two honest advisers. These are the court fools, who speak the deepest wisdom in puns, lest they should be taken seriously. They grimace, and tear their hair privately and weep.\" The novel drifts along at a good pace, very enjoyable until the last ten pages and they are brilliant; Isherwood at his best. There is a coded description of his love life and then there is this;\"There is one question that we seldom ask each other directly: it is too brutal. And yet it is the only question worth asking our fellow-travellers. What makes you go on living? Why don't you kill yourself? Why is all this bearable? What makes you bear it?Could I answer that question about myself? No. Yes. Perhaps ... I supposed, vaguely, that it was a kind of balance, a complex of tensions.\u201dThis is a little gem of a novel."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37797281-pat", "userReview": "Scrive Manganelli nella nota finale: \u201cSe Isherwood scrivesse musica, la sua predilezione ha qualcosa di infantile andrebbe ai fiati: romanzi per oboe, clarinetto, per corno di bassetto.

This slim book shows you everything that's wrong and that's right in the times--and tells you all you'll ever need to know about making a movie.

As he puffed it, he seemed to grow larger than life-size. His pale eyes shone with a prophetic light.\u2018For years I\u2019ve had one great ambition. You\u2019ll laught at me. Everybody does. They say I\u2019m crazy. But I don\u2019t care.\u2019He paused. Then announced solemnly: \u2018Tosca. With Garbo.\u2019Bergmann turned, and gave me a rapid, enigmatic glance. Then he exhaled, with such force that Chatsworth\u2019s cigar-smoke was blown back around his head. Chatsworth looked pleased. Evidently this was the right kind of reaction.\u2018Without music, of course. I\u2019d do it absolutely straight.\u2019 He paused again, apparently waiting for our protest. There was none.Very funny and very sad. In the mid30s, Bergmann has fled to Vienna with his family, leaving all his money and possessions in Nazi Germany. He\u2019s come to England in 1938 to prostitute his art in directing a corny musical Prater Violet, leaving his wife and daughter in Vienna--he needs the money. Mid-film, the Germans take over Austria. Bergmann, already as amazed and frustrated as Zweig was that these English can\u2019t see the evil and duplicity of Hitler, is frantic about his family.All Bergmann\u2019s pent-up anxiety exploded. \u2018The picture! I s____ upon the picture! This heartless filth! This wretched lying charade! To make such a picture at such a moment is definitely heartless. It is a crime. It definitely aids Dollfuss and Starhemberg, and Fey and all their gangsters. It covers up the dirty syphilitic sore with rose leaves, with the petals of this hypocritical reactionary violet. It lies and declares that the pretty Danube is blue, when the water is red with blood...I am punished for assisting at this lie. We shall all be punished___\u2019I had just spent two days at the Deutsches Historiches Museum in Berlin when I found this in an charity shop. Two days (and much recent reading) submerged in images of the two world wars, and the stories of the people who started and suffered from them. Touring the gleaming new glass dome of the Reichstag that replaces the one damaged in the (probably Nazi-set) fire of 1933 and again later in the Allied bombing. So this felt like a continuation of living as much in the last century as in this one. Our horrific news from Sudan and Yemen and Afghanistan mirrored by news from Belgium and Austria and Poland and...people continuing to make movies like--take your pick.Isherwood wrote (or at least published) this right after the war, and his Bergmann predicts all the disaster that looms in front of Europe. That part of the story is icy and fierce. But it is just as much a droll send-up of the movie business, filled at the top with crass but cagy executives, assisted by Cambridge boys with amused, well-paid nonchalance, and staffed by skilled crew members quickly but individually sketched. The writing is excellent until the last two or three pages, when Isherwood inexplicably devolves into a personal remembrance that melts away the power of his story. So definitely read it to page 98, and then stop."}, {"userName": "Rachel Brown", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11193019-rachel-brown", "userReview": "[All through the book, we learn a great deal about Bergmann, but less of Isherwood. He turns his observant eye on others, but not himself. (An early line in Berlin Stories is \"I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking.\")In the very last pages of the book, Isherwood lets us catch a glimpse of his life, his self, his soul, and what his relationship with Bergmann really means to him. After an entire book skating over bright surfaces striped with dark shadows, it's like a sudden plunge into deep waters, startling and revelatory and beautiful.The last page returns to the original tone, sparkling and funny and understated. But now we know what was beneath-- what is always beneath all our surface interactions and appearances and silly projects and casual chat. The actual text is a letter from a friend, about how much audiences are enjoying Prater Violet and snubbing a politically superior and very serious indeed Soviet movie about the proletariat.The very last line informs us that Bergmann moved to America with his family. The implication is that the success of Prater Violet got him a Hollywood job and so enabled him and his family to escape the Holocaust. The silly comedy that Bergmann reluctantly poured his creative energies into didn't turn out to be a great work of art. But it did save lives.Those last few pages, together with the rest of the book, suggests to me that the frustratingly absurd, shallow, everyday work and interactions are also necessary and important. Though Bergmann and Isherwood discuss serious things, their relationship is built not only on that, but on sharing the absurdities of Hollywood and writing their fluffy movie. Similarly, the sparkling body of the book is what makes the depth of the climax work.

But you will have to read it for yourself in the final few pages of this brief but varied novel.Hitler's war is looming. England dithers. Austria faces social unrest and a voracious Germany. The Jews exist perilously posed. And a trite Viennese musical is undergoing production in London under the baton of a larger than life Austrian Jew who detests his fairy floss creation,while his wife and daughter face peril in the real Vienna.

PRE-READ:This is a \"reward\" book given to myself...short and well-written, by a favourite author who has never disappointed.Having just read \"The Hare With Amber Eyes\",I feel I am in very familiar territory with this one,since it concerns an Austrian Jew, Friedrich Bergmann,a larger than life character,who is in England directing a film with a Viennese setting.He is in semi-exile from the Vienna of Dollfuss which fell to a bullying Nazi takeover and a very quickly organised Jewish persecution since anti-semitism was rabib there as \"The Hare With Amber Eyes\" chillingly illustrates.When a workers' socialist uprising occurs in Austria, the film director, whose wife and daughter are in Vienna, is naturally thrown into despair.Within the context of the film-making and the Nazi threat,nestles the delightful relationship between the young writer Christopher and the fatherly, dynamic,creative and generous European director.Isherwood plays a role very reminiscent of the French writerand a BIG favourite of mine, Colette, who often introduces herself into her stories playing a supportive role.Her \"Chance Acquaintances\" is such a novella which I never tire of reading and whose merits I have of course proclaimed on Goodreads.Another bonus is Isherwood's clear and lucid style.In comparison to \"The Spartacus Road\" whose gnarled style is exhausting, yet intriguing and challenging,I feel I am riding on a slippery dip with my old mate Chris.Thanks Chris wherever you are!!!"}, {"userName": "Gitte", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2963923-gitte", "userReview": "First Line: \u201cMr. Isherwood?\u201dYes, the protagonist of this book is Mr. Isherwood himself. Quite unusual, but also quite brilliant. The story takes place in London just before WWII, where Isherwood is working on a screenplay with Friedrich Bergmann. We follow the writing process and part of the movie production of \"Prater Violet\" \u2013 probably inspired of Isherwood\u2019s (i.e. the real Isherwood) own experience as a screenwriter in the 1930s.The story is also about the friendship between Isherwood and Bergmann. Their relationship was very amusing to follow. What a character we have in Bergmann! Just take a look at what Bergmann utters after meeting Isherwood for the first time:I am sure we shall be very happy together. You know, already, I feel absolutely no shame before you. We are like two married men who meet in a whorehouse.\nI LOVE Isherwood\u2019s writing! To me, he\u2019s one of the best. And I always love his description of the 1930s and 40s. He knows how to create a interesting setting about to be destroyed by the Nazis lurking in the background. Take another look at what he says about the Nazis (again, speaking through Bergmann):That is how they wish you to imagine them, as unconquerable monsters. But they are human, very human, in their weakness. We must not fear them. We must understand them. It is absolutely necessary to understand them, or we are all lost.\nIsherwood is a true master of setting, tone, characters and writing. His characters are always so real. And amusing. One of the things that really cracked me up was his description of himself as a fictional character: An arrogant, whiny, lazy little prat. But we love him for his honesty. And aren\u2019t we all whiny, lazy and arrogant from time to time? And don\u2019t we all know this feeling:I was feeling temperamental and sulky that day, chiefly because I had a bad cold. My conscience had driven me to Bergmann\u2019s flat, and I felt that my sacrifice wasn\u2019t being properly appreciated. I had expected to be fussed over and sent home again.\nThat one made me laugh! So all in all, Prater Violet was an entertaining and unusual little story. But I\u2019m still glad it was only 122 pages.

Also, it's the finest Isherwood book I've read, and I'm a lover of his words. A Single Man and A Meeting by the River are small, late works, full of brilliance, but incomplete. My Guru and His Disciple is a masterpiece of yogic truthfulness, but has no real ending. Isherwood was -- it's now believed -- a great diarist, but couldn't create literary structure. Here he does. On one level, this is a satirical memoir about moviemaking (but in London, at \"Imperial Bulldog Pictures,\" not Hollywood). On a second level, it's a remembrance of 1938, of Kristallnacht, of the threat of Hitler suddenly becoming real -- for the politically astute, a daily nightmare. Ultimately, the book is about Isherwood himself, shaking off his English provinciality and becoming a man. (Soon after, he and Auden expatriated to the USA.) Prater Violet illustrates the sadness of friendship, the burdens of accepting a stranger as an equal. (Also, it's a great title!)The Jews are never satisfied. They're always suing someone: each other, the goyim, God. They invented Marxism and psychotherapy, but that didn't help -- or rather, it only helped briefly. A Marxist sees the world clearly, but how can she act, knowing that all her blood and life flow into the evil designs of the bourgeoisie? Prater Violet confronts this question.

Set, as with The Berlin Stories, during Hitler's rise to power, Isherwood (the character--not the writer) is able to observe from the sidelines, involved in, but never truly of the action. He is the consummate observer--well-informed, empathetic but still relatively objective, and possessed of enough distance to be able to take the long-view. Here, Isherwood's role as a \"Carraway\" is compounded--he's observing Germany's invasion of Austria from England (through his eyes as well as those of his new found Austrian director friend), and he's also observing the world of movie-making from his position as a script writer/dialog doctor. Never fully immersed in either sphere, he floats along unfettered, a natural narrator who allows us to observe the story taking place as if almost through our own eyes."}, {"userName": "Quinn Slobodian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/235153-quinn-slobodian", "userReview": "Isherwood is the weird third in a trio with Sebald and Bola\u00f1o.

Or rather, of his writing. I was well aware of him before now. My close friends had read his work and always talked highly of him. I had seen the movies \u201cCabaret\u201d (1972) and \u201cA Single Man\u201d(2009) \u2013 both of which were based on his novels and both of which I had thoroughly enjoyed. I knew that he was a great friend of the poet W.H. Auden and I knew that Gore Vidal had described him as \u201cThe best prose writer in English\u201d. I even took in the occasion when the good Doctor, Matt Smith, played him in the one-off BBC television drama \u201cChristopher and his kind\u201d (2010). All this I knew; I just had never read one word of his work. So it was with some sense of anticipation, and a little trepidation if truth be told, that I started reading \u201cPrater Violet\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book revolves around Isherwood\u2019s relationship with the Austrian Jewish film director, Friedrich Bergmann, during their time together in the mid 1930\u2019s. It begins with Isherwood, an aspiring screenwriter, going to meet Bergmann in London to discuss his latest project: a historical romance called \u201cPrater Violet\u201d. Isherwood is cajoled and flattered into knocking the script into shape in collaboration with the brilliant but temperamental Bergmann. However, it becomes clear that his role also involves helping the studio to manage the great director\u2019s moods so they can be channelled creatively into finishing the movie. These \u2018moods\u2019 come about inconveniently for the studio as the director\u2019s thoughts turn, understandably and increasingly often, to his endangered family and his endangered homeland as Europe teeters perilously towards the Second World War.The novel, though perfectly plausible as a piece of non-fiction/autobiography given what we know about Isherwood\u2019s life as a novelist and Hollywood screenwriter, is actually a fictionalised first-person account which was written looking back at the 1933-34 period from the hindsight of 1945. This is not a criticism but it does explain Isherwood\u2019s standpoint and reasons for writing the novel. In Jonathan Fryer\u2019s biography of Isherwood, imaginatively titled \u201cIsherwood: A Biography\u201d (1977), he asserts that \u201cPrater Violet\u201d came out of Isherwood\u2019s experience working as a screenwriter on the movie \u201cLittle Friend\u201d (1934) for British Gaumont. \u201cLittle Friend\u201d was directed by Berthold Viertel, whom we can assume may have been the inspiration for Friedrich Bergmann in this novel.In terms of the quality of the prose, Isherwood is invariably deft of touch. The attention to detail in his descriptions of the chaos and jolly bonhomie in the production of this fatuous movie are extremely evocative. \u201cIt must have been exactly like that\u201d you think to yourself. Isherwood, though perhaps an unreliable narrator, is great company to observe the entire goings on as he humorously makes comment throughout the 103 page entirety of the novel. Indeed, the novel is short and it is slight. Very little happens of consequence. Isherwood himself does very little as our central character, he merely observes. He does not act. There is no action.This then is why he is an unreliable narrator. The apathetic Isherwood is a character, a fiction as much as Bergmann. All the while, the Isherwood character is describing frothy scenes of sound engineers joshing with over-officious producers, he feeds his writer\u2019s fury (the fury and frustration born of the hindsight of 1945) to Bergmann through his dialogue. As the \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201ctemperamental\u201d director rants and raves on set about his worries about Hitler\u2019s influence spreading like a pestilence, his worries for the welfare of all Europe and the international community\u2019s inaction, it sinks in that Isherwood the writer has seen it and felt it too. The storm clouds of Nazi Germany gather and rumble loudly throughout this novel. They are ever present and yet no one is listening. Or perhaps they are choosing not to hear.Hence, 1930\u2019s England\u2019s soft underbelly is exposed viciously by Isherwood the writer. The idea that these portents will sort themselves out through a misplaced trust in our political leaders - using common sense (or appeasement) or whatever - is held up for ridicule. Likewise, the \u2018splendid isolation\u2019 attitude of looking after what is closer to home - these are \u201cfar away places with strange sounding names\u201d after all - as the most sensible approach to navigating your way through shared global political issues is similarly punctured.What is unsettling is just how virus-like these attitudes are. It is clear to see, both in terms of national and international politics (since the end of the Second World War and up to the present day) how short people\u2019s memories can be and how limited & short-term our thinking can be in terms of how far we tend to extend our duty of care. It reminds me of the poem by the German pastor, Martin Niemoller:\n\"First they came for the\u00a0communists,\n\n and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.\n\n\n\nThen they came for the\u00a0socialists,\n\n\n and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a socialist.\n\n\n\nThen they came for the\u00a0trade unionists,\n\n\n and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.\n\n\n\nThen they came for me,\n\n\n and there was no one left to speak for me.\"\n\nThis poem, like \u201cPrater Violet\u201d, was supposed to have been written in 1945-46. Like Isherwood, Niemoller had become disillusioned following his experience during the war and long before it (Niemoller was a one-time supporter of Hitler who later opposed him and was consequently arrested and imprisoned in Dachau for not being enthusiastic enough about the Nazi movement).With such a well-documented time period as this there is the danger that fatigue sets in for the reader or viewer of any \u00a0piece of art we come across that seeks to depict it: there is a \u2018we\u2019ve heard it all before\u2019 attitude. Perhaps, this too affected me as I mistakenly dismissed \u201cPrater Violet\u201d as a bit of whimsy on first reading.On the contrary, Isherwood\u2019s prose fizzes and bubbles lightly like an alka-seltzer in water before sinking like a brick in the pit of your stomach. It sits with you and stays with you. I think more of it as each day passes. I can see parallels every time I switch on the TV news.IN SHORT \u2013 A deceptively frothy tale with hidden depths.

It\u2019s an interesting feature of his work that he blurs the line between memoir and fiction.As in Goodbye to Berlin, in Prater Violet Isherwood writes in the first person as a character named Christopher Isherwood and bases the tale on his own experience, in this case, his first foray into film. Nevertheless, it is a novel that reads like a novel. It has the freedom and snappy dialogue of the best fiction.Friedrich Bergmann, Viennese intellectual director, is a memorably-depicted figure. The character of Isherwood is only slightly less successful, perhaps because one has seen the type of the effete university-educated product of a middle-class home unable to act on his sympathy for the down-trodden before (most recently, in my case, in the author's Berlin collection). Still, this portrait is an interesting variation on the theme.While some of the supporting characters are sketchy, others are vivid; I think of Lawrence the technician, Chatsworth, the producer, and Ashmeade, Cambridge poet-turned-studio intriguer. The juxtaposition of the self-important, insular, crisis-ridden studio and the percolating instability of central Europe under the shadow of Fascism works for me. I was glad that the one was not clumsily portrayed as the counterpart to the other. The points of contact Isherwood evokes are sufficient, and deftly handled. A very good read."}, {"userName": "Sergio Caredda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14896465-sergio-caredda", "userReview": "Un libro strano per certi versi, che per\u00f2 sottolinea la grandezza di Isherwood come autore. Ambientato a Londra poco prima dello scoppio della seconda guerra mondiale, narra del modo con cui viene girato un film. E si incentra su un personaggio strano, un regista austriaco. Il racconto si muove veloce, in uno ritmo di commedia che a tratti diventa quasi umorismo puro. Se non fosse che il tutto avviene sullo sfondo dei fatti che porteranno all\u2019Anschluss dell\u2019Austria da parte di Hitler. Ed \u00e8 questo il punto che fa alla fine riflettere. Come i grandi temi della vita, la morte, la guerra, l\u2019amore vengano spesso vissuti sullo sfondo di una sorta di commedia che si astrae dalla realt\u00e0. Una lettura facile e veloce, simpatica in superficie, ma che nelle ultime pagine risuona di una sonora critica alla realt\u00e0 umana. E ci parla di Isherwood stesso come uomo e amante.

It's fascinating to hear about the film making process of the thirties in London. The more serious underlying narrative is the growing unrest due to the rise of Hitler, accessed through Bergmann's worries about his country and family, and, by the end, Isherwood's reaction to this looming catastrophe. But again you're left feeling that Isherwood has erased or deliberately disguised himself. He's a conduit for the story, not to be looked at.
