I remember thinking: How dare the sun rise, as if it were any other day, after such a gruesome night.\u201dFirst of all how do you rate someone\u2019s life? You can\u2019t give one or two stars and say things like \u201cuh, didn\u2019t like it\u201d or \u201cboring\u201d. That\u2019s not how it works.This is the first time that I\u2019ve heard of Sandra Uwiringiyimana. Sandra is a young woman, born in the Congo. Her tribe, the Banyamulenge, come from a province in Congo called South Kivu. They have Rwandan origins and as their appearance, language and accents differ from Congolese and Rwandan people, they don\u2019t belong to either nation and are often discriminated against. Sandra is working towards a broader awareness of her tribe\u2019s situation. She spoke in front of the United Nations and was interviewed by Charlie Rose during the Women in the World Summit in 2012. She wants more fairness and to end the hate and persecution that her people suffer from.I don\u2019t want to take away too much beforehand so let me just say a few things. This book tackles lots of important topics, including discrimination, persecution, feminism, mental health and family. It is moving and empowering and most of all: It\u2019s real. I started reading Sandra\u2019s book \u2013 about how she was raised, survived a massacre and later immigrated to the US \u2013 thinking only \u201cOh this sounds interesting.\u201d I\u2019m in a position where I have the luxury, the choice to face ugly news and truths or to blend everything out. Sandra could not. Further into the book I started to actually realize that this was real, that Sandra is someone who has left and is still leaving footprints. The events she describes in this book can be glimpsed on Youtube or Instagram. That\u2019s when reality hit me. A reporter asked Sandra in an interview how she survived the horrors of her past, like having a gun pointed at your head, seeing people getting slashed and burned. It felt like such a terrible question. How could you ask anyone this? But what Sandra is doing is brave and crucial. She fights for justice and for acceptance.This book is a raw and emotional autobiography, and while I wished to read more about what lead to this books creation, and about Sandra\u2019s work as a Global Ambassador, I think it\u2019s an amazing biography.Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin", "userReview": "Audio book narrated by the author, Sandra Uwiringiyimana. 6h 25 min  Wow! This November 2017 memoir about the author and her family 's journey from the DRC to refugees in Rochester, NY is definitely one of my favorite reads of this year.

All thoughts are my own. This was such a powerful book! I loved it, I mean I really loved it! To hear what Sandra has been through was heart breaking, but it also opened up my eyes to other atrocities that plague the world and how they go unnoticed or forgotten by the public. Sandra reminds us that although it may not be happening to us it definitely is happening all over the world.

It is the story of a girl who was looked at as an outcast no matter where she went. It is the story of a girl who left behind everything she knew to come with her family to America. It is the story of a girl who felt she didn't fit in a culture that was so different from the one she had known. It is the story of a girl who has to put her mental health before the approval of her family.

I love Sandra's quiet power in how she compares her life in The Democratic Republic of the Congo and her new life as a middle-schooler in the USA. Some of the comparisons are funny, and some are just horribly sad.I love the bottom line message about how race in the USA is a much bigger deal than it is in Africa. Sandra talks about how she never really thought about her skin color in Africa, even though there were many different skin tones and even white people in Africa, it wasn't a big deal until she got to the USA. She also tackles large issues like poverty, everyday racism, PTSD, and depression. I loved this book for it's strong narrative voice and its ability to tell a very needed story in a simple and engaging way. This book is easy to get into right from the start and stays poignant all the way through to the very end. Though she hobnobs with celebrities by the end of it all, Sandra remains a humble person and simply wants to get her voice out there and make a difference for the millions of displaced individuals in Africa and around the world. THEMES: war, race, poverty, family, death, PTSD, depression, refugees, rapeTHE BOTTOM LINE: A must-have for any middle or high school library. How Dare the Sun Rise tackles important issues like war and race with quiet dignity and hope.

The first few chapters were repetitive but it quickly picks up after that. I love how the author described everything in great detail. This is the story of a African war child and her move to America. A true testimony of a survivor. My favorite part of this book was her transition to America. The author describes everything when it came to food, culture, and race.

Also, I do generally read novels, so perhaps I am also judging this from a fictional standpoint, not nonfiction.For the negative first, ultimately, this just isn't the best-written book. Some parts are incredible, especially early on as she describes growing up in Africa, becoming a refugee, and the massacre on her refugee camp. But the further the book gets, there are an increased amount of weaker parts of the book. She gushes about the famous people she gets to meet in response to her activism, and she relies too much on a \"BUT THEN EVERYTHING CHANGED...\" vague cliffhanger too often. Also, her discussion of her depression/PTSD at the end felt a bit surface level. Which may be my preference for fiction coming through, but it didn't feel deep enough. Which is something else that I found weak--Sandra has experienced A LOT in her young life, but the book felt a bit unfocused in its subject. It covers war, violence, the refugee experience, moving to a new land, family dynamics, depression, activism, women's rights, race in America, and probably more I'm forgetting. Especially towards the end, this makes it feel unfocused.HOWEVER.I wish that everyone would read this book, especially in the political climate here in America. Being a refugee is not a choice. It is not anything but hard, and Sandra's story encapsulates this. Even as someone who supports refugees, some of her views were new to me. Or perhaps just a reminder that we are all human. What I want, those refugees want, too. Even with something like having cute clothes. Teens especially would benefit from reading this, as she talks about her experience at school. Overall, anyone who reads this will be sure to learn something about someone who is different from them and foster better understanding."}, {"userName": "Susanchitter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30320590-susanchitter", "userReview": "The author is a member of the Banyamulenge tribe from Rwanda who had settled in the Congo generations before. Because their customs and language were different they were always considered alien and subject to attacks. As a ten year old her family was living in a refugee camp Gatumba when it was attacked and over a hundred people brutally massacred including her youngest sister while many of her family were shot and left for dead. Eventually her family was allowed to come to America where they had to adjust to a completely new way of life. The book is simply written and delves into many current issues such as refugees, race relations in America and her hopes for the future. As a teenager the author began to tell the world of her people's situation at important world meetings and making a difference.

This is now at the top of my list of books that I highly recommend to students. Undoubtedly, adults will enjoy it, too! Sandra loses her sister in a massacre, endures poverty, flees her homeland to America, and her struggles don't end there, but despite her unimaginable hardships, she becomes an artist and an activist, and I can't wait to see what she what she accomplishes in the future.

The family, Rwandans, considered a hated Banyamulenge minority, lived in the mountains of South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Because of the wars and rumored wars, the family were stateless, and moved from place to place. They had settled in Uvira Province, a city in South Kivu, where the close-knit, loving family lived a peaceful life until, again, unrest started. In 2004, the family were placed in a refugee camp in Gatumba, Burundi. There is where 10-year-old Sandra witnessed the rebel massacre of families, including her six-year-old sister, Deborah, cousins, and the shooting of her mother, brother, and aunt. In 2006, Sandra\u2019s father heard of a resettlement program initiated to help displaced persons. After numerous interviews, the entire family were approved and immigrated to Rochester, New York, in 2007.The memoir explores Sandra\u2019s mental and emotional struggle, her coming of age in a new society, defining herself counter to the cultural expectations of family and, navigating through the angst of her teens, and living in America. Some might question Sandra\u2019s behavior in some instances, but I believe she suffered Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and guilt over Deborah\u2019s death. The family established a new life in America, but received no family therapy. Sandra did receive brief therapy while attending college. However, Sandra mentioned that culturally, the family does not speak of their loss or unhappiness; instead, they have a strong belief in the power of prayer.

The descriptions of Africa and life there were enlightening. The part about the massacre in the refugee camp was sad and tragic. Heartbreaking. The second half of the book was frustrating for me. I almost put the book down and stopped reading it. She is very focused on race in her book. She has a strong victim mentality that was hard to listen to.

There were a range of emotions that I experienced reading this book, fear, angry, sadness and joy. Sandra told an amazing story of herself and her families escape. Her life in constant war was normal or so it seemed, always fleeing her home and coming back, until one time she left and never had the chance to return home. She explains the struggles that she faced living in the refugee camp, the scarcity of water and food. Sandra takes us through the extensive interviewing process that she, and her family had to take to get to America. Once in America Sandra explains to us the struggles that she face not only being a African American women in America but the struggles she faced being from Africa. The stereotypes, the diversity, the separation of skin tone colors even with the African American community, everything was so new to her and hard to understand. Overall, I loved loved loved this book, this gave me hope, and a new understanding of what it is to be different. Sandra spoke on the taboo of mental illness even in her county, and mental illness is always a taboo subject in the African America culture. Sandra even spoke on how PTSD controlled her life in many ways.

Uwiringiyimana's story is compelling, heartbreaking, and astounding - as she states, it's shocking that the massacre she and her family endured was not international news. I'm not sure how a child lives through and recovers from that type of horror, though sadly thousands of children have to do this each year. Her determination to use her tragedy to fuel good for other refugees and the people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is beyond honorable, and I salute her courage and her work. She embodies heroism.That would have caused me to give it a 5 upon review. However, what brings it down to a 3 is because I'm never able to be drawn into her feelings or experiences because everything is factually stated. This happened. This happened. I did this. My people did that. But there is never a deep delving into her true feelings about any of it. I was understanding and tolerant of that about the massacre; she was a child and that was an experience from which most minds would want to shield and distance themselves. However, toward the end of the book, when she was experiencing flashbacks and nightmares, thrust in the midst of a deep depression, she doesn't share her feelings during that time either. She has some major feeling-inducing changes in her life, but it's still very factual. Telling me that you cried doesn't tell me why you cried or how you felt while you were crying. This was a very emotional journey; I wish Uwiringiyimana would have allowed the reader to go on it with her."}, {"userName": "Andrea at Reading Lark", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1844284-andrea-at-reading-lark", "userReview": "Review Posted on Reading Lark 4/27/17: http://readinglark.blogspot.com/2017/...This was a powerful memoir, but a difficult one to read. Sandra Uwiringiyimana is a young woman who grew up in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. War was a constant worry for her and her family; they were often displaced as fighting broke out. Things were even worse for Sandra's family as they came from a tribe that faced severe persecution in Congo. While Sandra's life in Africa, has many happy memories associated with it, it also holds some of her deepest pain.The book begins in happier times when Sandra recalls playing with her pet monkey, laughing with her little sister, and getting into trouble with one of her older brothers. She describes life in her village and remarks on how much she loves attending school. Sandra's family is unique in the fact that they value education for females in a society that does not always see this as good use of time for girls. Many girls learn the basics and then begin to train for their lives as wives and mothers. Sandra's parents want their children to have options in life beyond becoming a spouse. I admired Sandra's parents and the way they operated their home and managed their large family. My heart also broke for them when Sandra's oldest brother, Heritage, was kidnapped and forced to fight in the army. Sandra's father refuses to rest until his son is returned home which will eventually happen, but Heritage will be plagued by his time as a young soldier and fitting into life with his family will take time.As the family is beginning to make headway with Heritage, war breaks out. At the age of ten, Sandra finds herself living in a refugee camp in Burundi after her family had to flee their home in Congo. Life in a refugee camp is stressful and tedious. There seems to be a good bit of boredom for the kids and the adults carry the heavy burden of figuring out what is next for their family. One night as Sandra is getting ready to sleep next to her youngest sister, Deborah, who is only six, men with guns invade the camp. A violent and bloody massacre ensues which will forever change Sandra's life and outlook on the world. When the sun rises the next morning, Sandra realizes that her family will never be the same. Her account of this event is heartbreaking and difficult to read. I kept thinking of how her mother must be feeling during the entire event as she didn't know where all of her children were and if they had survived the brutal night. As a mother, my heart broke for her; I cannot imagine living through something so horrible.I was also shocked as this massacre was not something I had heard about before. As Sandra states in the book, so many Americans don't realize what is happening in Africa. I'm guilty of that. The news tends to dominate political matters and focus on other regions of the world, but reading Sandra's story and learning more about the plight of her people makes me want to be more educated about the current situations in Africa. After the massacre, the family moves to Rwanda where things are difficult and they live in extreme poverty. Things begin to look up for them when they learn about a possible relocation to the United States. After multiple interviews, the family is relocated to Rochester, New York. Sandra believes that her family has been handed a golden ticket. She will finally be able to experience the freedom and wealth that she believes all Americans possess, but she quickly realizes that the America on tv isn't reality for all Americans. Her family lives in a poorer neighborhood which comes with its fair share of crime. Furthermore, Sandra quickly begins to realize that race in America is not a simple thing. Her honest and heartfelt dialogue on race in the U.S. was another aspect that was difficult for me to read. I know that race still plays a huge factor in how people interact with one another, but it still hurts my soul to know that people in 2017 make assumptions about others solely based on race. I can only hope that one day we will learn to embrace our differences rather than use them to continue to divide us.I highly recommend this memoir as it touches on topics that are significant to current global and domestic issues. I could easily see it being used in a World History or US History class. Sandra's story deserves to be heard and Americans need to be informed about the current climate in Africa. I also applaud Sandra for being brave enough to share her story with the world. We need more young women like her speaking out and fighting to put a stop to injustice.One Last Gripe: My only complaint with this one is the pacing. Some sections I craved more detail as they sped by too quickly while other segments felt like they moved too slowly.Favorite Thing About This Book: This is one of those books that sticks with you. Days after I have finished it, I can't stop thinking about it and Sandra. No child should have to experience the trauma she endured.First Sentence: The night began softly."}, {"userName": "Devon H", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28101334-devon-h", "userReview": "A memoir from Sandra's perspective, How Dare the Sun Rise is the story of Uwiringiyimana's childhood in a war torn country and her family's immigration to the United States as refugees. Uwiringiyimana grew up in the DR of Congo and later moved to Rwanda as a refugee, ultimately emigrating to the us. She speaks from the heart very honestly and openly about her experiences. She loved school, but often school was interrupted by war, and she would flee with her family.\u00a0Uwiringiyimana's worst nightmare occurs when she watches her mother and sister gunned down before her. She writes about the event throughout the book, as the story continues to be revisited and to ultimately unfold in her grief and post-traumatic stress.\u00a0However, her problems are not all solved when she moves to America. Much like the book I just finished reading, Girl in Translation, Uwiringiyimana moves to New York with her family where they are put in a new school where she doesn't understand the other kids' customs and culture. They tell her she acts white, but the white kids don't want to hang out with her because she looks black. She finds herself often in between binaries with nowhere to go because the binary doesn't create space for someone who grew up in Africa.\u00a0At one point in school, after she has established herself more and speaks English more fluently, her class watches Hotel Rwanda. This is the first time many of the kids from the US have seen the violence that happened to Uwiringiyimana play out before them, and they were unaware that war occured in that way. Uwiringiyimana shares it as a kind of break through with the other kids because she is able to share with them some of her background and they show empathy towards the people in the movie and towards her.\u00a0From then on Uwiringiyimana never gives up the idea that people will care if you share with them, that rather than being unsympathetic, people are just ignorant and don't know of the horrors in the world. She continues her activism, sharing her story more and more so that people cannot ignore the tragedies that befell her people. Her story is one of grace, and I appreciate so much the work that she does and the compassion that she draws out of people.\u00a0This is a must have book for schools, as it's so important to share these stories with our children so they know how to move through the world with compassion and without ignorance."}, {"userName": "Anna Silverman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51807359-anna-silverman", "userReview": "Extremely inspirational; a beautiful story about survival and overcoming whatever demons you experienced in your past."}], "description": "In this powerful memoir, Sandra Uwiringyimana, a girl from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, tells the incredible true story of how she survived a massacre, immigrated to America, and overcame her trauma through art and activism.Sandra Uwiringiyimana was just ten years old when she found herself with a gun pointed at her head. The rebels had come at night\u2014wielding weapons, torches, machetes. She watched as her mother and six-year-old sister were gunned down in a refugee camp, far from their home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The rebels were killing people who weren\u2019t from the same community, the same tribe. In other words, they were killing people simply for looking different.\u201cGoodbye, life,\u201d she said to the man ready to shoot her. Remarkably, the rebel didn\u2019t pull the trigger, and Sandra escaped into the night. Thus began a new life for her and her surviving family members. With no home and no money, they struggled to stay alive. Eventually, through a United Nations refugee program, they moved to America, only to face yet another ethnic disconnect. Sandra may have crossed an ocean, but there was now a much wider divide she had to overcome. And it started with middle school in New York. In this profoundly moving memoir, Sandra tells the story of her survival, of finding her place in a new country, and of her hope for the future.", "title": "How Dare the Sun Rise: Memoirs of a War Child", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31751594-how-dare-the-sun-rise?from_choice=true", "average": 4.27, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1477313227l/31751594.jpg", "reviews": 324, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14775725.Sandra_Uwiringiyimana", "name": "Sandra Uwiringiyimana"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14775726.Abigail_Pesta", "name": "Abigail Pesta"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Biography", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31751594-how-dare-the-sun-rise", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31706524-how-dare-the-sun-rise", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33518697-how-dare-the-sun-rise"]}
