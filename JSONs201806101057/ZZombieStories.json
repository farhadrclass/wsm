All of the stories in this anthology (save the final entry from Thomas S. Roche) have been previously published - a fact that I completely missed when I started the book. Having read Rot and Ruin, imagine my surprise when I started Jonathan Maberry's \"Family Business\" only to find that it was the same (truncated, introductory) story! Luckily, that was the only entry of the bunch that I had read, so diving in was as simple and smooth as incisors biting through a pile of fresh, juicy, warm brains. \"Family Business\" by Jonathan Maberry tells the story of angry, young Benny Imura, who resents his sickeningly responsible older brother Tom. In a post-apocalyptic world, Benny resists joining the family business of zombie killing - but as he's just turned fifteen, the law dictates he get a steady job and give back to society. Faced with no other alternatives, Benny reluctantly learns the ropes from Tom, and discovers that his older brother has depth and secrets he never could have imagined. This entry from Maberry is actually the first part of Rot and Ruin (a full length YA zombie novel), and focuses on the strained relationship between two brothers from the (irritating) perspective of young Benny. I wasn't the biggest fan of Rot and Ruin, though I eventually came around once Benny stopped acting like such a ginormous, self-entitled tool - unfortunately, \"Family Business\" focuses entirely on this early characterization, leading up to Benny finally realizing just how tough Tom's job is. It's a great character arc, and \"Family Business\" does a great job of insulating and encapsulating that larger storyline in a relatively small amount of space. I don't know why (other than some personal taste quirk), but Benny really, really annoys me and that high level of frustration distracted from my reading pleasure, both with the original novel and this shorter story. That said, he's not written badly - it's just a personal taste thing. \"The Wrong Grave\" by Kelly Link features another douchey teenage dude protagonist. When Miles's girlfriend Bethany dies, he's distraught and romantically decides to bury his numerous love poems with Bethany in her coffin. Ten months later, though, he wants his poetry back to enter a contest (and, idiotically, Miles didn't save or make copies of his work). The only way to get his work back is to dig it up Bethany's grave... but he accidentally digs up the wrong dead girl. A strange, macabre story, written in Kelly Link's trademark quirky style, \"The Wrong Grave\" is a wryly funny and ultimately touching story about life after death - for both the living and the dead. \"The Days of Flaming Motorcycles\" by Catherynne M. Valente is one of my favorite stories of the anthology, told from the point of view of Caitlin Zielinski, the last non-infected person in Augusta, who knows more about the so called \"zombies\" than it seems anyone else does. Eloquent, precise, and beautifully written, \"The Days of Flaming Motorcycles\" shows a different side of the infected - that of remnant intelligence and the ability to grieve. \"The Barrow Maid\" by Christine Morgan is another clear favorite from this anthology, a Norse Viking tale of destiny and revenge from beyond the grave. When the great, heralded warrior Sveinthor the Unkillable is inexplicably killed in battle, his beautiful wife Hildirid proudly drinks poison and lies by his side at his grave to accompany him to Valhalla... except she wakes up hours later, still alive. Due to a profound act of treachery, the great Sveinthor and his king father have been betrayed and Hildirid has been spared, but that won't save the traitor or the invaders from Sveinthor's reach as he rises from the grave to mete out his grim justice with Hildirid, his beloved barrow-maid, by his side.\"You'll Never Walk Alone\" by Scott Nicholson tells the story of a boy and his father as they take refuge in their church and faith from the zombie apocalypse, hiding from those that are \"gray\" and punsihed for their sins. Written in heavy-handed country dialect (i.e. \"The sun come up higher and I wondered about the cows. Did the gray people eat them all? It wasn't like they ain't enough sinners to go around.\"), this story wasn't my favorite, but does examine the apocalypse from a different perspective than any other entry in this anthology.\"The Dead Kid\" by Darrell Schweitzer feels a lot like Stand by Me (or, more appropriately, \"The Body\") from Stephen King. There are a couple of violent, sick bullies that find a dead boy that isn't quite dead, and decide to keep him around for fun. Davey wants to fit in with Luke and his tough crowd, but discovers that fitting in comes at a high cost - and inexplicably finds his life changed for the better by the dead kid. I liked the idea of this story and the examination of the draw that bullies have on others, but wasn't a fan of how the author chose to end the story (with a bit of a cheesy, moralizing look into the future and how senseless Luke and his whole crew were their whole lives - there's really no need for the explicit message-making).\"Seven Brains, Ten Minutes\" by Marie Atkins is, if nothing else, memorable. Eerie. Super weird. Disgusting. There's this boy, see. He likes this beautiful, bitchy girl, and decides that to save her and impress her, he's going to win a competition...for zombies. He's not a zombie, but he pretends to be one in order to beat a brains-eating record. Need I say more? In what universe would this master plan end well? Delightfully squishy, and juicy, and entirely gross.The Third Dead Body\" by Nina Kirki Hoffman tells the story of a reanimated murdered prostitute, following two other murdered prostitutes before her, finally has her revenge on her killer. Stumbling a little in its execution and a little unclear as to who Sheila really is and how she's become the way she is (embodying the spirits of the fallen, murdered women before her), I loved the concept of this story and its melancholy end.\"The Skull-Faced Boy\" by David Barr Kirtley is another memorable entry, featuring two different types of zombies - the mindless, rotted corpses of old, and the newly converted dead capable of higher cognitive function and manipulation. Oh, and it's also a story about two friends fighting over a girl. One of them wins...sort of. \"The Human Race\" by Scott Edelman was probably my least favorite of all the stories, only because the juxtaposition of zombies and terrorism felt extremely heavy-handed to me, not to mention the fact that an act of terrorism followed by the zombie apocalypse is just a *little* bit over the top. \"Deepwater Miracle\" by Thomas S. Roche brothers speed away from pirates and zombies on a boat. That's unique. Action packed, zippy, and the only story in this anthology that is original to the anthology, I enjoyed this fun, nautical zombie take. Like any collection or anthology, some stories are bound to be stronger than others and such is the case with Z: Zombie Stories. I'm not sure that the anthology truly is indicative of YA/coming-of-age zombie fiction, but the highs of the book outweigh the few duds. Recommended for the short fiction fan.Notable Quotes/Parts: From \"The Days of Flaming Motorcycles\": Now, zombies aren't supposed to get sad. Everyone knows that. I've had a lot of time to think since working down at the Java Shack on Front Street became seriously pointless. I still go to the shop in the morning, though. If you don't have habits, you don't have anything. I turn over the sign, I boot up the register - I even made the muffins for a while, until the flour ran out. Carrot-macadamia on Mondays, mascarpone-mango on Tuesdays, blueberry with a dusting of marzipan on Wednesdays. So on. So forth. Used to be I'd have a line of senators out the door by 8:00 am. I brought the last of the muffins home to my dad. He turned one over and over in his bloody, swollen hands until it came apart, then he made that awful howling-crying sound and licked the crumbs off his fingers. And he started saying my name over and over, only muddled, because his tongue had gone all puffy and purple in his mouth. Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin.So now I drink the pot of coffee by myself and I write down everything I can think of in a kid's notebook with a flaming motorcycle on the cover. I have a bunch like it. I cleaned out all the stores. In a few months I'll move on to the punky princess covers, and then the Looney Tunes ones. I mark time that way. I don't even think of seasons. These are the days of Flaming Motorcycles. Those were the days of Football Ogres. So on. So forth.Rating: 6 - Good"}, {"userName": "Cecelia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67555-cecelia", "userReview": "Back in September, when I discovered that Night Shade Books was releasing a young adult zombie anthology, I wondered what that would look like (and I told myself to hope for the best). After checking out the author lineup, I knew I\u2019d find stories equally interesting, weird and well-written in this volume. And I did. I just didn\u2019t quite bargain for the crazy, gross and not-right that came along with. But, after all, it\u2019s zombies. You\u2019ll say I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised.All of the entries in this anthology (except for the final story) have been published previously in other volumes, and some of them were already familiar to me. Of course, that doesn\u2019t diminish their charm. I\u2019ll say a little something brief about each one, shall I? Great. \u201cFamily Business\u201d by Jonathan Maberry \u201cFamily Business\u201d appears to be the first several chapters of Maberry\u2019s young adult zombie novel, verbatim. I reviewed Rot & Ruin here on the blog. This excerpt should draw you in and make you want to learn more about the Imura brothers and their quest to survive. \u201cThe Wrong Grave\u201d by Kelly Link A disturbing and funny tale about a boy who digs up the wrong grave \u2013 and finds something entirely unexpected (and persistent). There\u2019s a good dose of magic and side of uncanny in this tale. Fans should next look to Link\u2019s Pretty Monsters. \u201cThe Days of Flaming Motorcycles\u201d by Catherynne M. Valente If I\u2019m honest with myself, this is the story I was most excited to read. Valente has a way with words, and it doesn\u2019t desert her here. \u201cFlaming Motorcycles\u201d is about a girl living in the remains of Augusta, Maine, but it\u2019s also a meditation on the nature of zombies, acceptance, and what could possibly be important after death. True and truly weird. \u201cThe Barrow Maid\u201d by Christine Morgan I never thought I\u2019d write this, but Viking zombies are the freakiest and best idea ever. \u201cThe Barrow Maid\u201d combined epic storytelling in the style of Beowulf with the undead \u2013 a startling, unnerving, genius mixture of creepy and outstanding. \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u201d by Scott Nicholson Would you like a chilling, atmospheric story that will drift into your mind like mist and never let go? This story\u2019s spiritual overtones somehow made the apocalypse seem more eerie and terrible than ever. Beautifully written, and the sort of thing that might inspire nightmares, in a The Knife of Never Letting Go sort of way. \u201cThe Dead Kid\u201d by Darrel Schweitzer Not what I would call a teen-friendly story, this one veers into horror territory. It is unsettling and all-around freaky. \u201cSeven Brains, Ten Minutes\u201d by Marie Atkins If you like your zombie stories gory, this one\u2019s for you. Somehow until now I\u2019ve managed to read a lot of zombie lit without reaching a level of gross-out. Well, I\u2019m there now. Scott\u2019s \u2018evolution\u2019 certainly made me queasy. Not for weak stomachs. \u201cThe Third Dead Body\u201d by Nina Kiriki Hoffman Hoffman does deeply disturbing very, very well. There\u2019s no beating around the bush \u2013 this entry is HORROR, and it\u2019s also full of revenge, twisted longing, and extreme violence. Adults only. \u201cThe Skull-Faced Boy\u201d by David Barr Kirtley In this tale, it\u2019s about die-and-live or die-and-kill, and the result is a battle not between the living and the dead, but between those with consciences and those without. It doesn\u2019t end well, and in the end is a sickening portrait of the worst in humanity. \u201cThe Human Race\u201d by Scott Edelman Terrorism, dark despair, and a zombie outbreak combine to create a perfect storm of hopelessness for one girl. \u201cThe Human Race\u201d explores what people can withstand \u2013 and what will probably destroy us all. \u201cDeepwater Miracle\u201d by Thomas Roche To end the collection, a story with a bit of light-hearted survival. Okay, it\u2019s not so light-hearted, but SURVIVAL. After the darkness in the middle of the anthology, this one brings you back out into the light. How? Two brothers stuck on a boat in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico figure out how to go on while the world on land ends around them. Gripping reading. In Z: Zombie Stories, editor J.M. Lassen brings together well-written stories of mayhem and apocalypse. However, the level of scary and disquieting varies from story to story, and it is not for everyone. While each tale may feature a teenager, the entries are not necessarily young adult. For those seeking a gentler initiation into the world of zombies, check out Justine Lavaworm and Holly Black\u2019s Zombies vs. Unicorns instead.Recommended for: mature teens and adults accustomed to horror, and those who can\u2019t resist the unsettling power of a good zombie tale."}, {"userName": "Karissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4057501-karissa", "userReview": "I got an advanced reading copy of this book through Netgalley(dot)com. This was an excellent collection of zombie stories. It started out really strong with some excellent stoires; most of the stories were well done and all-in-all it was an above average anthology of zombie stories. Most of these stories have appeared in other collections: the only story original to this collection is Deep Water Miracle by Thomas S. Roche.The first four stories in the anthology were some of the strongest. Family Business by Jonathan Mayberry was so touching and creative that I want to go out and read his zombie series Rot and Ruin right now! The Wrong Grave by Kelly Link was a fun story and full of irony. The Days of Flaming Motorcycles by Catherynne M. Valente was beautiful and darkly sweet. The Barrow Maid by Christine Morgan was an interesting fantasy story with a very creative take on zombies; also exceedingly well written. My other favorite was The Human Race by Scott Edelman; this story was so beautiful and haunting just absolutely wonderful.These stories encompass a wide breadth of new and known zombie mythology (to put it loosely). I think those who enjoy zombie stories and creative takes on them will enjoy these stories. The beginning of the anthology consisted of incredibly well done stories, I was very impressed. I like the collection of zombie stories in here much more than I liked the collection in Zombies vs. Unicorns.Some of the stories are gory and most of them are a bit depressing (you know end of the world and all that) but they are aimed at a young adult level. Overall this is a very solid collection of stories. Some of the stories in the beginning are especially remarkable. Fans of zombies should definitely check this out. See below for a full list and mini-reviews of the stories included.- Family Business by Jonathan Mayberry (5/5)A brother learns the family business of zombie killing from his older brother. A very touching story, very creative, and I absolutely loved it. This definitely convinced me to go and pick up the Rot and Ruin series by Mayberry. It's a great story.- The Wrong Grave by Kelly Link (5/5)A boy digs up his girlfriend's grave to get his book of poetry back and gets more than he bargained for. This was a super fun story and had some nice surprises in it. I enjoyed it a lot.- The Days of Flaming Motorcycles by Catherynne M. Valente (5/5)A beautiful and excellent story about a girl who learns that zombies can be sad. I loved how this story was written and loved the imagery in it. An absolutely terrific story.- The Barrow Maid by Christine Morgan (5/5)A Norse tale where an unkillable warrior is killed and then rises again to seek vengence on his enemies. A sweet tale, with some wonderful action and fighting, beautiful description too.- You'll Never Walk Alone by Scott Nicholson (4/5)About a country boy and his dad who run away and hide in a church during the zombie outbreak. The story is told from the son's point of view and is well done. It is a sad and distubring story and a bit ambiguous, but all in all I liked it.- The Dead Kid by Darrell Schweitzer (3/5)About a kid growing up who is trying to get in with a bad crowd. He ends up being saved by a dead kid.- Seven Brains, Ten Minutes by Marie Atkins (3/5)About a boy posing as a zombie who gets stuck in a brain eating contest and gets a bit carried away.- The Third Dead Body by Nina Kiriki Hoffman (4/5)About a young hooker who raises from the dead to find revenge on the man who killed her. Well done and creepy.- The Skull Faced Boy by Daivd Barr Kirtley (3/5)Two boys get into a car accident and turn into intelligent zombies. Okay story, but nothing super creative.- The Human Race by Scott Edelman (5/5)A girl whose family has just been killed by a terrorist attack wanders London only to find herself in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. Beautifully written, I loved this story. Edelman captured the depression and emptiness of the girl wonderfully. I love how through the mass death in London she finds the will to live her own life.- Deep Water Miracle by Thomas S. Roche (4/5)A couple of brothers outrun pirates and laughing zombies on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico. It was a good story. Well written and engaging."}, {"userName": "usagi \u2606\u30df", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1101220-usagi", "userReview": "This was a fun bunch of stories, but I was kind of disappointed. Some of the pieces used for this anthologies have been around for awhile, and I was kind of hoping for totally brand new stories from everyone all around. Don't get me wrong - I loved these entries (especially the beginning of \"Rot & Ruin\" by Jonathan Maberry. What was definitely the strength of this anthology was the sheer amount of variation there were between the entries. Some were very emotionally touching, some were funny, some had a dystopia-like living situation going on, and some were all of the above all in one story. I really enjoyed Kelly Link's contribution to this one, and loved the idea of her character keeping track of time with whatever picture is on the cover of her notebook (in this case, flaming motorcycles) - I thought that was incredibly clever, and it's definitely one of my favorites within this anthology.But I do admit, as I said before, I do wish this had been something entirely new, and not just stories collected within the last two decades of YA lit. While I understand that YA lit has now grown to approximately 25% of the literary market, and gathering these stories is a great way of showing how YA has expanded in the last twenty years, I just wanted a completely shiny new anthology whose pieces I hadn't seen somewhere else had already been used. But since the sheer amount of variation (and quite frankly, some of the best of the best) in the stories used really won me over, this is why it gets a four out of five. If you're looking to get into zombie lit, or you're looking to get into YA lit through some delicious zombies, I highly suggest you try out this anthology. It's a great way to get into the Halloween mood, but it's also a great way to see how far we've come in terms of YA lit in such a short time. Just don't read it at night alone, or you might have a few nightmares (like I did). Or do so anyway, and enjoy those nightmares. Either way, give this anthology a try - it's definitely a fun read for all.(posted to goodreads, shelfari, and witchoftheatregoing.wordpress.com)"}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/267866-audrey", "userReview": "Zombies have been hot for the last few years, and this anthology showcases some of the latest works featuring teens in zombie scenarios. Many of the stories tell tales of post-apocalyptic zombie-infested zones. That isn\u2019t all there is though: there is a story about a living dead boy who is made that way through magic, the faithful servants of a dead king who rise again when called upon, and the psychological changes that undergo a person who is pretending to be a zombie. Usually horrifying, often funny, this anthology has a story that\u2019s sure to please every zombie fan.The only disappointment I had with this anthology is that so much of the stories were first published elsewhere. I\u2019d already read the Jonathan Maberry and Kelly Link stories in other books, and so I skipped over them. This was a real bummer because I\u2019m such a fan of their work and was looking forward to something new. My complaint shouldn\u2019t turn off people who haven\u2019t read these already, though, since they are very strong stories and do add a different dimension to the anthology.That said, all but two of the stories here were new to me, and I read a lot of zombie fiction. If you\u2019re curious, take a look at the table of contents, and I\u2019d bet that most of the stories will be new to you. After I finished each story, I felt compelled to move on to the next, which meant that I finished this anthology fast.

A couple of stories focus more on the horrors of humanity than flesh-eating, these include The Skull-faced Boy, The Third Dead Body, and Seven Brains, Ten Minutes. There were a couple of weaker stories, but overall this was an interesting collection.Strangely, the strength of this volume is also its weakness. The diversity of the stories is excellent, but at times a bit distracting. This is a collection that it would be good to take down off the shelf, read a story, and put it back for a week or two rather than reading the entire thing through in one go.

Other noteworthy stories are \"Family Business\" by Jonathan Maberry (although ending is predictable), \"Seven Brains, Ten Minutes\" by Marie Atkins, and \"The Third Dead Body\" by Nina Kiriki Hoffman.Overall, however, the anthology as a whole is about average and the stories all appear in other sources (nothing new for this collection).

There are many kinds of stories here -- some apocalyptic, some not. There are several stories about survivors against the horde, and several about young people who either by choice or accident join the horde (there's an interesting theme of community in such stories, of loneliness and the need to be part of a group, even if the group is the dead). And many varieties of story in between. Here are a few that stuck with me:This is the third (or fourth) time I've read \"The Wrong Grave,\" by Kelly Link, in which a young man digs up his girlfriend's grave to get back his poetry, only to find he's dug up the wrong one. It's just as creepy and fun to read the third (or fourth) as it was the first. Marie Atkins' \"Seven Brains, Ten Minutes\" has to be the most viscerally horrifying of the lot. In it a young man goes to desperate (and disturbing) extremes to rescue and impress a girl he likes, leading to an ending that is terribly and delightfully unsettling.Like most of Catherine Valente's stories, \"The Day's of Flaming Motorcycle,\" is hard to sum up, but it's certain intellectually fascinating in the way it approaches the zombie. The story of a girl living in a town full of zombies -- without much hassle -- is entertaining, but there's also an underlining sense that this story should be analyzed in more detail, because it means something.Then there's \"The Human Race,\" by Scott Edelman, which is so, so heart-wrenching. About a girl whose family dies in a terrorist explosion while traveling in London. While she's traveling there to identify and collect her family's remains, a worldwide zombie outbreak occurs. I won't say more than that, because it's really a beautiful story that deserves to be taken on its own merits. and finally - SPOILER - Johnathan Mayberry's story, \"Family Business,\" is interesting to me from a conceptual point of view. I like the idea of respect for the dead, even if the dead are trying to kill you. In it a boy learns the \"hunting\" business from his brother, who leads him beyond the fences of the community to hunt the undead. But it's shown to be more complicated than just killing zombs, as there is an emotional reality that lies behind the dead walking. It reminds me of a scene in Walking Dead, where the survivors say, \"We bury our own, and burn the rest,\" which is to say, we take a moment to respect those who meant something to us and give them proper burial. Mayberry's story makes it clear that every zombie belongs to someone (is someone's father, mother, brother, sister) and therefore deserves a respectful burial. However, I'm not sure I'm in love with the execution of the story, as ever step of the hunting trip leads the character to this ultimate understanding. The problem is that I could feel the straight line of the argument that was being mounted (not just for the character, but for the reader, too), and so the effect came off preachy. So..., not my favorite of the stories, but still very, very interesting."}, {"userName": "Michelle Ehrich", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6783359-michelle-ehrich", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book from Goodreads for free through the first reads program.

With books like this, I tend to skip around but still end up reading the whole thing. I think my favorite was The Barrow Maid. It was so different from other zombie stories that it really drew me in. I recommend this book, it's entertaining and a very quick read."}, {"userName": "Sarah Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4727547-sarah-wilson", "userReview": "I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads. I didn't enjoy most of the stories. I liked \"Family Business\" by Jonathan Maberry best out of this collection. I would rate that story 3 stars.
