This book is absolutely soaking in quotables and may have the best prose of any noir I\u2019ve ever read. Add in a classic main character and a solid plot and you have a nice shiny bundle of win.\u00a0PHILIP MARLOWE:\u00a0Chandler\u2019s iconic PI is an arrogant alcoholic who fails every PC test you can formulate. He\u2019s racist (from what I recall he insults African-Americans, Japanese and Native Americans and maybe others), homophobic and sexist enough that I would blackjack him on the braincase before he ever got within 10 yards of either of my daughters. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019s also mesmerizing and fills up the page with his presence. His entertainment value is off the charts and he cracks wiser than anyone this side of Sam Spade. But whereas Hammett\u2019s Spade is all slick, smoky quips and cat-like grace, Marlowe is the \u201cother side of the tracks\u201d version. He\u2019s unkempt, rugged and surly and his words are crusty with barbs.\u00a0Whereas Spade\u2019s every move seems coordinated and cross-referenced like a well-rehearsed play, Marlowe is all reaction, counterpunch and intuitive hunches.\u00a0However, like Spade, he\u2019s also smart (much more than he usually lets on) and has a knack for clear thinking and being able to read people. Best of all though, the man is incapable of cutting slack or giving inches and is saltier than the Pacific Ocean.\u00a0THE PLOT:\u00a0A convoluted series of mini-mysteries all stemming from Marlowe\u2019s search for the ex-girlfriend of a just released from prison man-mountain named Moose Malloy. Fairly typical noir stuff but very well executed and paced to perfection by Chandler.\u00a0THE WRITING:\u00a0Finally\u2026the prose. The real star of the show. I would say Chandler\u2019s writing is a masterful example of noir. There may be others as good but it is hard for me to imagine any better. I would put Chandler\u2019s prose into 3 separate and equally impressive categories that you don\u2019t usually see from a single pen. First, you have a whole host of \u201cI have to remember that\u201d lines that are just fun to read. Quotes like:\u00a0\u201cThe eighty-five cent dinner tasted like a discarded mail bag and was served to me by a waiter who looked as if he would slug me for a quarter, cut my throat for six bits and bury me at sea in a barrel of concrete for a dollar and a half, plus sales tax.\u201d\u201c\u2018Who is the Hemingway person at all?\u2019A guy that keeps saying the same thing over and over until you begin to believe it must be good.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything. I lit my pipe again. It makes you look thoughtful when you\u2019re not thinking.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt was a nice walk if you liked grunting.\u201d\u00a0\u201cShe gave me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI like smooth shiny girl, hardboiled and loaded with sin.\u201d\u00a0\u201cA Harvard boy. Nice use of the subjunctive mood. The end of my foot itched, but my bank account was still trying to crawl under a duck.\u201d\u00a0Second, Chandler has a wonderful facility for painting descriptions so that you feel like you\u2019re walking right beside Marlowe and he does it in such sparse, efficient style. \n1644 West 54th Place was a dried-out brown house with a dried-out brown lawn in front of it. There was a large bare patch around a tough-looking palm tree. On the porch stood one lonely wooden rocker, and the afternoon breeze made the unprunned shoots of last year\u2019s poinsettias tap-tap against the cracked stucco wall. A line of stiff yellowish half-washed clothes jittered on a rusty wire in the side yard.\u2026I was looking into dimness at a blowsy woman who was blowing her nose as she opened the door. Her face was gray and puffy. She had weedy hair of that vague color which is neither brown nor blond, that hasn\u2019t enough life in it to be ginger and isn\u2019t clean enough to be gray. Her body was thick in a shapeless outing flannel bathrobe many moons past color and design. \n Those descriptions materialized in front of me more than pages of less polished prose could accomplish. It felt like I was there. Finally, there are the passages that aren\u2019t just clever quips or snappy dialogue, but that convey a real sense of emotion.\u00a0\u201cShe hung up, leaving me with a curious feeling of having talked to somebody that didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\u00a0\u201c\u2026a sudden flashing movement that I sensed rather than saw. A pool of darkness opened at my feet and was far, far deeper than the blackest night. I dived into it. It had no bottom.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThere was just enough for to make everything seem unreal. The wet air was as cold as the ashes of love.\u201d\u00a0That is the trifecta of writing. Brilliant, sharp and fun\u2026.descriptive, informative and polished\u2026and evocative, moving and powerful.\u00a0Yes, 5.0 stars and a definite must read for fans of noir, mysteries or just superb prose.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!"}, {"userName": "Henry Avila", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5431458-henry-avila", "userReview": "Mr. Philip Marlowe, is six feet tall, and weighing 190 lbs. man, women find quite attractive, maybe a tough guy, to many onlookers, in a sleazy, and a low -paying occupation, too, but is not a superhero, no eyes in the back of the head, when someone smashes his skull with a club, from behind, bigger, stronger men can, and do beat him to a bloody pulp, but the private detective is relentless and will get up...

Of his novels,I'd say this is one of the best character-driven ones.It was published in 1940,and the content is somewhat old fashioned,but every time I open this book,I can meet timeless Philip Marlowe,a man of principle.Just for this reason,I'll be reading it forever."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "Philip Marlowe is looking for a woman's missing husband when he encounters Moose Malloy, a brute fresh out of prison, looking for his lost love Velma. Moose kills a man and Marlowe gets corralled into looking for the missing Velma. In the mean time, Marlowe gets another gig as a bodyguard and soon winds up with a corpse for a client. Will Marlowe find Velma and get to the bottom of things?As I've said before, noir fiction and I go together like chronic constipation and heroin addiction. Farewell, My Lovely, Philip Marlowe's sophmore adventure, is one of the better noir tales I've ever read.I wasn't completely sold on Farewell, My Lovely at first. It seemed like it took a little longer to get started than the Big Sleep. Once Marlowe got warmed up and I forgave it for not being The Big Sleep, I was completely absorbed by the writing. Chandler's poetic prose only got better in the gap between the Big Sleep and this book. There were even more quotable lines in this one. Chandler's similes reminded me of P.G. Wodehouse's at times, maybe the kind old Plum would write if he was in the grips of a powerful hangover.\"I lit a cigarette. It tasted like a plumber's handkerchief.\"As for the plot, it's only slightly less convoluted than the Big Sleep. The two cases didn't intersect much until the end and I only guessed the big twist a paragraph or two before it happened. As with the previous book, the prose was the star of the show. Marlowe took so many blows to the head in this one that I had sympathy pains while reading it.While I wouldn't say it's as good as The Big Sleep, Farewell, My Lovely is a classic and not to be missed by noir fans.

Are there other authors or titles that come to mind, perhaps even more focused on the primacy of style?Steve: Well, let\u2019s see\u2026 Maybe the first book I read where a certain shadowy deportment really popped as a pure statement of style was Raymond Chandler\u2019s Farewell, My Lovely. The book itself was a cannibalization of three earlier short stories of his. Whereas the stories were neatly contained as standalones, the edits in piecing them together were more slapdash, sacrificing both congruency and clarity in the process. Chandler responded saying, \"My whole career is based on the idea that the formula doesn't matter, the thing that counts is what you do with the formula; that is to say, it is a matter of style.\u201d And of course that hard-boiled, noir feel of his is prevalent to this day. Audience Question: I may be taking you further afield, but is this visual, visceral style brought on by Chandler one that necessarily de-emphasizes plot?Steve: I don\u2019t think so. Style is not everything. (Nor is image, much as Andre Agassi would have us believe on Canon's behalf.) Furthermore, \u2026Audience Question: [interrupting what would surely have been an insightful elaboration on the topic of substance v. style] But think back to the movies. When you picture Bogie and Bacall in The Big Sleep, do you remember the on-screen chemistry and the wise guy patter, or is it a plot detail, something like the perp who stole the falcon, that stuck with you? Steve: Actually, wasn\u2019t that Dashiell\u2026Audience member: [blurting out] For me, it\u2019s Bogie and Bacall. Even in black and white they sizzle. Steve: Admittedly, HumpBac, as I like to call them (retrofitting a nickname) were iconic, but\u2026Another audience member: Those couple combo names have kind of run their course, don\u2019t you think? Who\u2019s even together at this point? Certainly not Brangelina. TomKat? \u2013 no. Zanessa? \u2013 no. Yet another voice from the audience: What about Bennifer? Are they? It\u2019s hard to keep track. And another: I don\u2019t think so. I suppose Lizard (that is, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton) were the first of the on-again, off-again power couples.Host: I\u2019m afraid we may be veering off course as litterateurs, my friends. This isn\u2019t an episode of I Love Lucy, after all. Should we redirect ourselves? Steve?Steve: Actually, that\u2019s often how it works with me \u2013 seemingly on point for brief spurts before devolving into flapdoodle.

It's a classic of crime fiction; it was first published in 1940, and it's been reviewed thousands of times, mostly by people far more competent than I.Suffice it to say that this is the second full-length novel featuring Los Angeles detective Philip Marlowe, following The Big Sleep, which had been published in 1939. Marlowe was the prototype for all the tough, wise-cracking P.I.s that would follow, and Chandler was really the first crime fiction writer to fully exploit the setting of Los Angeles. Scores of writers have followed in his footsteps, but very few have succeeded as well as Chandler did.As the book opens, Marlowe is searching for a missing husband when he encounters a mountain of a man named Moose Malloy who is staring up at a bar above the barber shop where Marlowe had hoped to find the aforementioned missing husband. Malloy, fresh out of prison after an eight-year stretch, is looking for his lost love, Velma. Malloy hasn't heard from Velma in all of that time, but that has not quenched his affections for the woman who used to work in the bar.Eight years is a long time, and in the interim, the bar, which used to be a white establishment, has now become an African-American one, although in 1940, no one would have described the place quite that politely. Well, one thing leads to another and Malloy drags Marlowe up the stairs and begins demanding answers from the people in the bar who, not surprisingly, have never heard of Velma.Malloy winds up killing someone in the bar and takes off, leaving Marlowe to explain things to the cops. From that point on, Marlowe is entangled in Malloy's search. As a sideline, he also takes a job body guarding a guy who is trying to exchange cash for a valuable jade necklace that was stolen from a friend.Neither job is simple and neither turns out very well, and before long, Marlowe is up to his neck in trouble with the cops and a whole lot of other people as well. Before it's all over, he'll be beat up, doped up, pushed around, and lied to, but it's all in the nature of the job.The plot really doesn't make a lot of sense, but nobody reads Chandler for the plot. The book is beautifully written with one great line following another. Through Marlowe, Chandler rolls back the curtain and exposes the seamy side of pre-war L.A. It's not a pretty sight, and you sometimes get the impression that Marlowe might be the only honest, decent man in the state.The Big Sleep may be one of the greatest crime novels ever written, and it's an impossible act to follow, even for Raymond Chandler. I like this book a lot, but I don't think it's quite on a par with the first book in the series. A solid 4.5 stars for me."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "Phillip Marlowe is one of the most famous and influential characters in detective fiction. He\u2019s also a racist alcoholic, and after all the blows to the head he routinely takes, he\u2019s almost certainly suffering from post-concussion syndrome so you gotta question his judgment.But he\u2019s also the guy that says things like this:\"It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window.\"And this:\"He looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food cake.\"And this:\u201d\" I needed a drink, I needed a lot of life insurance, I needed a vacation, I needed a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat and a gun. I put them on and went out of the room.\u201dSo I always find myself making allowances for Marlowe\u2019s bad habits and personal failings.Marlowe is working a boring job trying to find a missing husband when he has the bad luck to come across Moose Malloy. Malloy is a giant hulk of a man who just got out of prison and is looking for his lost love, Velma. Unfortunately, Moose is kind of simple and doesn\u2019t know his own strength so he ends up killing somebody when asking questions. As a witness, Marlowe tells the cops what he saw and is coerced into trying to find Velma by a lazy detective. However, a real paying job as a bodyguard for a guy delivering a ransom for the return of stolen jewelry comes up so Marlowe ditches the Malloy mess. But things don\u2019t go quite as expected.One of the better Chandler novels, this is pretty typical Marlowe. The plot doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, but that\u2019s not really important. It\u2019s all about atmosphere and attitude. If you can get past the casual racism that litters the early chapters, you\u2019ll find one of the classics of noir fiction."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Not as complicated as it seems or as Chandler would like you to believe. And that's a-okay! I love a little private dick action and this is perfectly satisfying!This story of a thug getting out of prison and trying to find his girl is fairly straightforward, but Raymond Chandler throws a bucketload of red herrings into Farewell, My Lovely in an attempt to throw you, dear reader, off the trail. Stick to the yellow brick road, Dorothy, and you'll figure it all out in short order. Fresh off The Big Sleep detective Philip Marlowe is at it again in this sequel to that highly popular and well-written mystery. Farewell, My Lovely is an admirable followup, but it would be tough to meet or top one of the best detective novels of all time. Book two in the Marlowe series marches forward, doing its best to recreate the original with a bevy of interesting characters that are relatively well-drawn for the crime noir genre. All that good, whip-smart, wise-crackin' dialogue you know and love is in place. It's just the plot that's a little out of whack. Chandler attempts to confuse the situation, and generally succeeds, but not in a particularly clever way. It's like a muddied up pond, but a pond nonetheless, so you can swim fairly easily through the murky waters to the other side.Don't get me wrong, Farewell, My Lovely is still really good reading and any fan of the genre will enjoy it.

There is a scene where he watches a little bug moving round the office and it's really quite funny and observant.It's dated -largely in a cool way. Nowadays attitudes are different but there is racism, referring to overly groomed men as pansies, the way women are thought of and described- these are historically accurate now and were contemporary at the time of writing. Everyone chain smokes and is practically alcoholic too.I love Chandler's writing and I have a black and white movie visual going on the whole way through.

When his employer is tucked in for the big sleep, Marlowe tries to piece the crime together, taking a few lumps in the process.As abrasive as a sheet of sandpaper coated in shattered glass, Philip Marlowe isn\u2019t one to check his attitude at the door. He\u2019s also an alcoholic, a racist, and unapologetically hardheaded. With all these character flaws, why is Raymond Chandler\u2019s signature series so damn enjoyable? It probably has something to do with Chandler\u2019s endlessly quotable prose.The backbone of any story worth reading is the way the author\u2019s prose plays out on the page. You could have the most exciting plot imaginable but if the writing isn't up to snuff, it\u2019s not worth the paper it\u2019s printed on, but sometimes an author can be so good that the plot is almost secondary. The true joy can come from random musings about life, death and everything in between or even the exceptional way an author crafts a setting or describes a character. Raymond Chandler is one such author and while the case surrounding Farewell, My Lovely isn't particularly outstanding, he is certainly a masterful storyteller.Throughout the story, Chandler takes the reader in a multitude of directions and when Marlowe makes any sort of headway, a new element is introduced thus changing the case. It\u2019s often a wonder Marlowe gets anything done when half the time he\u2019s soaking himself in bourbon while seemingly trying to burn bridges with his smarmy attitude and general distaste for anyone he meets.Farewell, My Lovely is an excellent novel and a more than worthy follow up to The Big Sleep.

Phillip Marlowe is a great faceted character which contrasts nicely against the one-dimensional villains, cops and women who populate the stories.

There was so much going on that, at times, I lost the thread, but that was only a minor irritation. The ending brought everything together and made the chaos of what preceded make sense.If the book had been written today, I would have felt it to be derivative, but this is one of the originals from which noir is derived! And if it had been written today, the view of and language used about Negroes, Italians, Mexicans and Jews would put me off for sure. But it wasn't written today and spending some time in 1940's LA made reading this book a treat. And did I mention Elliot Gould was brilliant?"}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda", "userReview": "Some dithering on my part between 4 and 5 stars\u2014but I am going for 5 because I so enjoyed the reading experience.I fear that I will repeat myself a lot from my review of The Big Sleep. Chandler\u2019s writing is awesome\u2014very expressive, yet very spare. Each novel is a complete joy, but not padded with anything extra. Occasional, brief descriptions of surroundings paint a full picture with very few strokes. His vocabulary choices are spot on. A delight to read.I very much receive the impression that Philip Marlowe is Raymond Chandler\u2019s alter-ego, the man that he fantasized about being. Handsome, brave, always knowing what to do, street smart, alluring to the ladies, and able to handle his liquor or a punch to the face. By all accounts a troubled man, Chandler certainly wrote the drinking scenes like he knew what he was talking about. It may have been the thing that he and Marlowe shared most in common.Beautiful writing about less than beautiful subjects\u2014Chandler is one of the masters."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "After reading two of his novels now, I'm beginning to like Raymond Chandler much more for his writing than for his plots. For anyone who thinks crime fiction has no place in the literary world, the Marlowe novels might make you change your mind. Chandler's an amazing writer when it comes to social commentary, the similes, metaphors and the sharp, electric prose he's famous for, and of course, his superb depiction of the city of angels of the 1940s that is so lifelike you almost feel that you're along with him for the ride. The novels are also a way for Chandler to examine American society of the time.While I am not much of an analyst when it comes to reading -- a) there are a huge number of analyses of Chandler and his writing all over the place and b)I'm just not good at it so don't pretend to be -- one thing I particularly noticed in my reading was Chandler's use of the color red. To me, where ever Chandler focused on mentioning red, some kind of danger -- emotional or physical -- was nearby. Velma, Malloy's old sweetheart, was a redhead. Anne Riordan, daughter of an ex-police chief and an ally of Marlowe's in this book, is also a redhead. He likes her enough to keep some of the worst details from her and finds himself thinking about how her apartment would be a \"nice room to wear slippers in.\" He watches a red neon light flashing in the hotel room where he stays just before getting on the water taxi to go out to the gambling boat. He meets ex-cop and boat driver Red Noorgan, with \"hair the shade of red that glints with gold,\" who has \"Violet eyes. Almost purple. Eyes like a girl, a lovely girl,\" with skin Marlowe describes as \"soft as silk\" and a voice that was \"soft, dreamy, so delicate for a big man that it was startling. It made me think of another soft-voiced big man I had strangely liked.\" There are likely more instances, but I found the use of red quite interesting here. The mystery plots that eventually tie together are a little clunky, but I loved this novel and I wish I had read these books long before now. The writing alone is worth working through the convoluted plotlines, but most of all I love the character of Marlowe. As I found in The Big Sleep, he's a knight of sorts in a city where knights don't really have a place -- and I really like that about him. FYI -- this book was written in the 1940s so you're going to encounter some pretty ugly racial slurs and racist attitudes as you read. That sort of stuff is a bit shocking, but considering the times, not so unusual for back then.definitely recommended -- now on to the third Marlowe novel."}, {"userName": "Erik", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik", "userReview": "Reading Raymond Chandler is a bit like wandering through a haunted house. You know that around every corner will be something new, some person popping out with a chainsaw to make you scream. In Chandler's case, it is an incredible description or metaphor or stylized piece of dialogue that will make you scream, and they'll be screams of delight.Consider this description:A large, thick-necked Negro was leaning against the end of the bar with pink garters on his shirt sleeves and pink and white suspenders crossing his broad back. He had bouncer written all over him. He put his lifted foot down slowly and turned slowly and stared at us, spreading his feet gently and moving a broad tongue along his lips. He had a battered face that looked as if it had been hit by everything but the back of a dragline. It was scarred, flattened, thickened, checkered, and welted. It was a face that had nothing to fear. Everything had been done to it that anybody could think of.In one paragraph, Raymond Chandler's genre-defining noir detective Philip Marlowe perfectly describes this bouncer and what he looks like. And when the huge convict, one Moose Malloy picks him and tosses him aside, easy as a lion swats aside a ball of yarn, well... you know you've got a man who's not to be trifled with. And you know you've got a story with more twists n turns than that same ball of yarn. But somehow, someway, Marlowe will manage to unravel it.I could, perhaps, talk more about how Philip Marlowe has spawned the long-lasting archetype for the gruff, wise-cracking broody and flawed detective with a heart of gold. But I find myself unable to give it justice. Instead let me just quote Raymond Chandler himself:In everything that can be called art there is a quality of redemption. It may be pure tragedy, if it is high tragedy, and it may be pity and irony, and it may be the raucous laughter of the strong man. But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. The detective in this kind of story must be such a man. He is the hero; he is everything. He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor\u2014by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it, and certainly without saying it. He must be the best man in his world and a good enough man for any world. I do not care much about his private life; he is neither a eunuch nor a satyr; I think he might seduce a duchess and I am quite sure he would not spoil a virgin; if he is a man of honor in one thing, he is that in all things.He is a relatively poor man, or he would not be a detective at all. He is a common man or he could not go among common people. He has a sense of characters, or he would not know his job. He will take no man\u2019s money dishonestly and no man\u2019s insolence without a due and dispassionate revenge. He is a lonely man and his pride is that you will treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you ever saw him. He talks as the man of his age talks\u2014that is, with rude wit, a lively sense of the grotesque, a disgust for sham, and a contempt for pettiness.The story is this man\u2019s adventure in search of a hidden truth, and it would be no adventure if it did not happen to a man fit for adventure. He has a range of awareness that startles you, but it belongs to him by right, because it belongs to the world he lives in. If there were enough like him, the world would be a very safe place to live in, without becoming too dull to be worth living in.Farewell, My Lovely is my favorite Chandler novel. It's got just the right mix of sadness and mania, truth and deception, all wrapped up in Chandler's scintillating prose. So if you're the type of person who loves fine writing, you'll be hard-pressed to find finer than in these pages and a thrilling crime story to boot. That's like having your cake AND eating it too, and that's a rare thing."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley", "userReview": "\"Even on Central Avenue, not the quietest dressed street in the world, he looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.\"I'm gonna admit right up front that the fourth star of my rating comes entirely from Raymond Chandler and his way with words. Nobody knew how to turn a phrase like good old Ray-Ray. I mean, what a guy. What a kick he must have been at parties.I don't normally read books for language alone. I'm an emotional reader, and my emotions tend to be tickled by character development and plot rather than language, and I'm a sucker for a well-turned phrase in service of plot or character. But Raymond Chandler's books I really couldn't care less about character or plot. With him, it's all about atmosphere, and despite the dark seedy underbelly exposed in his books, his sense of diction is so playful. Just take a look at this gorgeous passage. It's so simple, but so full of attitude:\"The call had come at 10:08. Marriott had talked maybe two minutes. Another four had got us out of the house. Time passes very slowly when you are actually doing something. I mean, you can go through a lot of movements in very few minutes. Is that what I mean? What the hell do I care what I mean? Okay, better men than me have meant less. Okay, what I mean is, that would be 10:15, say. The place was about twelve minutes away. 10:27. I get out, walk down in the hollow, spend at the most eight minutes fooling around and come on back up to get my head treated. 10:35. Give me a minute to fall down and hit the ground with my face. The reason I hit it with my face, I got my chin scraped. It hurts. It feels scraped. That way I know it\u2019s scraped. No, I can\u2019t see it. I don\u2019t have to see it. It\u2019s my chin and I know whether it\u2019s scraped or not. Maybe you want to make something of it. Okay, shut up and let me think.\"I mean, come on! I was going to try and imitate his writing for this review, but I just don't have that kind of sass in me. Who calls getting banged on the head \"getting my head treated\"? I don't know. There's just something about it that makes me laugh.And the plot in this one is extra discombobulated because Chandler cannibalized three separate short stories he'd already written and reworked them into one story. so it's like he's got three separate things going on with very little to connect them: a story about a very large man just released from prison who Marlowe witnesses killing a black man in a night club, and who the police are looking for; the search for a night club singer that used to work in the night club, but hasn't been seen for eight years; and a story about a psychic who also deals in organized crime, and has bought off sections of the police force. But still, he makes it work because what he's concentrating on is the writing and the characters, not the details of the plot. He's like a magician waving his hands and getting you to look at one thing, and forget the other exists.I highly recommend the Philip Marlowe audiobooks, specifically the version narrated by Elliott Gould. His voice is absolutely perfect for Marlowe, and he nails the deadpan tone of the thing."}, {"userName": "K.D.

But this book had a personally touch to it. I felt intrigued, captivated and amused by this unconventional character that by the time I finished Farewell My Lovely, I could only see Marlowe as a real person come to life, rather than a fictional character. This case was a serious and dangerous one for Marlowe, HE was the one being targeted. It started when an escaped convict, looking for his girlfriend dragged Marlowe into a coloured establishment. Who then shot two employees out of confusion, and fled the scene. Marlowe was reluctant to get involved in the search for the convict \u2013 he was broke and was in need of a paid job - but a lazy and incompetent Investigating Officer pressured Marlowe to do a little snooping. Which led Marlowe into a sequence of seemingly unconnected events involving corrupted police and politicians, a jewelry heist, crime bosses and drug lords. But Marlowe interference was upsetting an unknown person or a gang, and they wanted him out of the way. He was drugged, severely beaten and choked. The torture he endured here had a lasting effect Marlowe, ruined and disturbed him in a big way. I tried to yell, for no reason at all. Breath panted in my throat and couldn\u2019t get out. The Indian threw me sideways and got a body scissors on me as I fell. He had me in a barrel. His hands went to my neck. Sometimes I wake up in the night. I feel them there and I smell the smell of him. I feel the breath fighting and losing and the greasy fingers digging in. Then I get up and take a drink and turn the radio on.Chandler seriously out done himself; the writing was phenomenal, and while I loved what I\u2019ve read to date, I can finally say I have witness a true literary genius in the great man. Farewell My Lovely is overflowing with exquisite razor sharp dialogue and phrases - I wanted to frame them up on my wall. Yet there were moments in his dialogue where Marlowe revealed more of himself where he openly expresses out loud or through his train of thought, his vulnerability, his fears and distressed And it felt like the characteristics that we know so well in Marlowe - the sarcasm and hard edge attitude and the excessive drinking problem that was so prominent in this book - was just a way to cover up or to numb those feelings away. Farewell My Lovely is clever plotted crime, not as complex as The Big Sleep, but equally as intriguing and tense, vivid imaginary of seedy LA in the 1940 and superb literature that is a class of its own. Now I\u2019ll leave you with one of my favourite quotes:They had Rembrandt on the calendar that year, a rather smeary self-portrait due to imperfectly registered color plate. It showed him holding a smeared palette with a dirty thumb and wearing a tam-o\u2019-shanter which wasn\u2019t any too clean either. His other hand held a brush poised in the air, as if he might be going to do a little work after a while, if somebody made a down payment. His face was aging, saggy, full of the disgust of life and the thickening effects of liquor. But it had a hard cheerfulness that I liked, and the eyes were as bright as drops of dew.I was looking at him across my office desk at about four-thirty when the phone rang and I heard a cool, supercilious voice that sounded as if it thought it was pretty good. It said drawlingly, after I had answered:\u201cYou are Philip Marlowe, a private detective?\u201d"}, {"userName": "Red Panda", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-red-panda", "userReview": "Philip Marlow makes for a distinctly distasteful protagonist. He's a homophobic, mysogynist racist with a pretty large booze and cigarettes monkey hanging from his back. A lot of this can be put down to the time in which he operates; almost everybody held the same prejudices in that time and place. It still makes for uncomfortable reading for this 21st century liberal at times.Why am I reading this, then? Well, it's pretty simple: Chandler's writing is phenomenal. He pretty much defined the crime noir genre with his beautifully descriptive writing. (Could he be any more seminal? Sorry; wrong Chandler...) He doesn't so much write as paint pictures with words and beautiful, if grimy, pictures they are.Also, his 'voice' is so distinctive and so engaging that it supersedes the unlikeable nature of his characters and skewers the reader like a maggot on a rusty fishhook, making it impossible to look away.

It lends a lot of character to Philip Marlowe who, in the hands of another writer, wouldn't be nearly so interesting. It's funny reading Chandler and realising that a lot of books I've read before were influenced by him. There's racism and misogyny and it's kind of like a time capsule from times and places I'll never see, but what I read it for is the writing style: the crisp images, the lack of cliche, the precise choice of words. Speaking synaesthetically, it tastes nice.Somewhere in the middle I lost track of exactly what was happening and why, in between all the different parties and the (rightly) confused parts with Marlowe all drugged up and a bit incoherent. Anne Riordan isn't a bad woman or an unlikeable character, but she doesn't seem to have much point in the plot, either.It's easy to read, even when you don't really get what's going on.

While I liked The Big Sleep I think the former is better. This novel's keyed me into how and where Chandler crosses that magic line between literature and the forgettable books lining the Mystery section shelves. Farewell, My Lovely's storyline is solid but secondary to Chandler's whip-smart dialogue and top-notch inner monologues. Marlowe is less of a dick (I don't mean private detective) here, but he's not, well, hugging people or whatever. He goes deep and dark with the self-loathing, much of which is arguably deserved, but his hammer-headed approach provided the template for so many similar characters. While I'm not comfortable asserting that Chandler invented his own genre, from what I can tell he refined one to the point where his work is considered a gold standard. Farewell, My Lovely isn't perfect; the way Marlowe falls into the case made my eyes roll just a little bit. But put all that shit aside and enjoy yourself. A few passages (e.g. the one when Marlowe tries to sleep in a seedy waterfront hotel, the one when Marlowe hooks up with a slutty girl) rise to greatness. Books of depth aren't often this much fun.
