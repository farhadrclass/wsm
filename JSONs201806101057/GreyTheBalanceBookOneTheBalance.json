So take that as a review in itself, but why I wanted to write one for \"Grey\" is because paranormal books are almost all gender specific. \"Grey\" is NOT! My wife and I are both avid readers but we have trouble finding books we both like in the genre. For guys you have the Dresden files with stuff blowing up (which I like but my wife rolls her eyes to) or for the ladies you have what? Anita Blake, Sookie Stackhouse, or Rachel Morgan? I tried those but there were way too many lines like \"His ass looked yummy!\" I'm not homophobic but reading about guys yummy asses just doesn't work for me. The words \"yummy\" and \"ass\" to the best of my recollection never appear in the same sentence in \"Grey\".If you want to read a funny, gritty book that is real and entertaining no matter what gender you are I really recommend this, oh and the second book in the series is even better."}, {"userName": "Supergeekgirlsam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11387982-supergeekgirlsam", "userReview": "I thought this was an absolutely brilliant story! I loved the flow, the language, the humor and the philosophy. In the world of modern spoon-fed fiction, Stienbeck\u2019s influence on Shamhart\u2019s style is obvious. The story though quick-paced is complex and the vocabulary nothing short of perfect. The dialogue \u201csounds\u201d like real people. No wooden characters speaking with perfect grammar even though they\u2019re from some place like inner-city Detroit. The humor and interaction between the characters brings to mind Joss Whedon\u2019s ill-fated, yet wonderfully written \u201cFirefly\u201d. If you are tired of recycled concepts and want something original that will make you think and make you laugh then I highly recommend the Balance books.There are few series that beg to be re-read. I mean if you're a big fan boy or super geek, sure you're going to re-read your favorites over and over until you get to the point where you don't even really need to read them because you know the story so well, but re-reading it gives you that childlike you of re-watching the same cartoon over and over. Each of the Balance books so far have had that re-read drive, but not for the \"It's my geek out favorite\" that other series are. The re-reading is because the stories are so intertwined that you pick up so much that you missed the first time around. There are references to later books in \"Grey\" and I'm sure there are other ones in the other books. The whole series is intertwined. Unlike anything else but King's Tower books.There are also short stories that elaborate on side characters on the author's website. Really cool extra information and stories! http://nickshamhart.com/short-stories/"}, {"userName": "Mitch Jackson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15235786-mitch-jackson", "userReview": "I loved this book, but my girlfriend hated it. Without getting too personal she is younger than me by more than a few years. She is smart for her generation, but \u201cGrey\u201d and the other Balance books require a person to know or at least to have been through life long enough to understand that they aren\u2019t going to live forever. She loves vampire books and I think she my actually believe vampires are real, on some level. I\u2019m not joking. So, no these books aren\u2019t good for young people who may actually believe vampires are real. The philosophy in the Balance books is the best application of complex sociology, religion, and plausible science in a contemporary action story I have ever read. I\u2019m an atheist. I don\u2019t believe in an afterlife, but I\u2019ll be damned if Shamhart doesn\u2019t make me wonder."}, {"userName": "Cathy M.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15458674-cathy-m", "userReview": "This was a wonderful creative read. The concepts of continued life after death are the questions of every person religious or not in their heart of hearts (they all doubt). I cannot get over the believability of the characters and realism of their interaction with each other and the one-sided dialogue with the title character Grey and the reader is nothing shy of brilliant. The language is rough enough to be real without over doing the speech patterns of a country cowboy. I bought this book for my dad and he loved it too. I do agree with some of the other reviews that say readers who predominantly go for YA books are not going to appreciate the intricacies and double meaning in this book. The symbolism and duality of human nature concepts are not YA material."}, {"userName": "Jack Winston", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7723334-jack-winston", "userReview": "I know people give lengthy reviews rehashing the story. I will not. The best review I can give this book is \"Action for the Intellectual\"! I read an article comparing Shamhart's language skills with that of Twain. I am a huge Twain fan, so I picked this book up with the idea of tearing it apart and saying, \"Never!\" to the comparison.Shame on me, I was wrong. Sure there are better stand alone novels out there. But as far as the first book in a series goes? You will not find one that comes close to \"Grey\". I am very eagerly awaiting the rest of the Balance Books."}, {"userName": "Heather J.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16564419-heather-j", "userReview": "I love originality in the books I read. I\u2019m not a big fan of the mainstream trash you find at Wal-Mart and Target, which are quickly becoming the only places you can buy paperbacks without going to a used or Indie bookstore where the prices will be too high.\u201cGrey\u201d was fantastic in the presentation. I enjoyed the back and forth narrative, and the other books are even better. Some author\u2019s can\u2019t write outside of what they know. How many Stephen King characters are authors the same age as he was when he wrote the book? I like the fact that each character has a distinct \u201cvoice\u201d in this series. I read an interview with Shamhart where he talked about the forms of his characters. He said something like personalities are becoming so uniform because everybody watches the same shows, movies, and reads the same books that they mostly fit under some genre labeled personality type: the Scoundrel Hero, the Femme Fatal, the Loveable Big Guy, the Accident-prone sidekick. He wanted to use those characters, but make them the origins of those clich\u00e9s. Grey lived in the time of cowboys. He \u201cIs\u201d where the cowboy personality model comes from. Raven was the original Femme Fatal from the time of Jackboots, and so on. I thought that was cool because it was a descent rational for using characters that people say are overused, but what other characters are there? Nobody wants to read about the nerd that sits at her computer all day.I also have always been agnostic. I thought the way Shamhart blended Western Religion with Eastern Philosophy and a bit of real science was very inventive. I could take of leave the humor. It was there. I chuckled, but I didn\u2019t think it was that funny, but I was looking at the depth, not the slapstick."}, {"userName": "Mike Sheffield", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7562167-mike-sheffield", "userReview": "Fascinating book. First off you just don't find a book with this much humor on the fiction market outside of books shelved under \"humor\". There were several places I had to stop because I was laughing so hard. The characters in this ghost story, I guess that's what it is, I'm kind of stumped on how to classify it, are awesome. You love them all and they leave you wanting more. I have never enjoyed the first book of a series so much. First books always have to explain the rules and introduce the characters, Nick Shamhart does that in an exciting way that no one else has before. Step aside Harries Potter and Dresden, move along Roland, there is a new supernatural sheriff in town, meet Grey!"}, {"userName": "Tina Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7529793-tina-lynn", "userReview": "I love paranormal fiction.

Look, I'm a woman, I have needs sure, but I also want to just read a damn book, too.Mr. Shamhart shows a talent that is very rare in many authors his senior in experience. He gives you action and deep thought all in the same book.

There is too much for the author to tell and build for it to be a five star book. Though I see lots of people disagree with me. I won't say that I wasn't tempted to five star \"Grey\" but it just still falls short. It does everything the first book in a series should. It pulls your attention in. It does it with style and creativity. And most importantly it leaves you wanting more.So as far as a first book in a series goes I can't recommend \"Grey\" more. The first Potter book is boring and childish in its simplicity. The Hobbit is really dry. The first Dresden book almost had me not read the rest. Dune is good for what it started, but that first book? Did I say the Hobbit was dry? Dune is dry both figuratively and literally. The character Grey or Jasper Reynolds is my kind of guy. He plays the tough cowboy card because that's his history, but he still has a sense of humor and is a deeper thinker than I will ever be. The two part story is a blast. It gives you a look into the character's head. It makes what is typically a two dimensional character and adds that third level, making him feel real, like he is personally talking to the reader. The series as a whole is outstanding, and this is a great start!"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17015738-heather", "userReview": "\u201cHave you ever wondered what happens to you when you die?\u201dThis book is a great spin on that age old question. We all ask ourselves it. No matter what our religious beliefs are, or aren\u2019t. We all wonder about death. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if death was just the beginning of the adventure? That\u2019s what \u201cGrey\u201d is, the beginning of the adventure.Most times the first book in a series just sets the stage and it isn\u2019t until the later books that you really get cooking with the characters, but I loved all three of the available Balance books equally and cannot wait for the next installment.There is something for everybody in these books: slapstick comedy, smartass wit, action, deep philosophy on par with Jung and tweaked with Zen if you know what you are looking for, plausible science, believable dialogue, and it\u2019s an quick, easy read. I would recommend this book and series to anybody with a sense of humor, a thirst for adventure, and if you\u2019ve ever wondered about life after death!"}, {"userName": "Cammie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11907092-cammie", "userReview": "This was an amazing first book in a series.

I go to church every Sunday. I will also admit that a lot of what I read in the Bible and the more I found out about my religion, the more I find I question it. I believe in a God. I grew up with Christianity so that is what I practice. I'm not saying something zany like I believe that the Balance is my new faith. I think those Scientology whack jobs need to get in touch with reality. Here's what I am saying, if there are thousands of people out there that believe in a cult created by a science fiction author, with little to no theological basis, then something like the Balance should have millions of cult followers! This universe makes more sense than anything based on aliens! Mr. Shamhart knows more about my own faith Christianity than I ever will. That is obvious halfway through the book. The Balance is about faith, science, and that gut instinct we all have that the world needs to be in harmony. It incorporates all religions and philosophies. No one who believes in something should be offended by these books. If you miss out on the religious quality of these books and you're just reading them for the action and the humor then you are really missing out."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9031472-alicia", "userReview": "I almost missed this!

I read for pleasure and I read for insight. I don't force my ideas on people because that just shuts down their listening. The Balance books are fantastic! A look into the psyche of each of the series major characters instead of just the lead character running the show. The insights are amazing and beyond what I have found in anything shy of theological and psychological books.I think that's why when I scroll down through the reviews it is almost all Really Liked and Loved, but the occasional sore spot sticks out with. I didn't get it, or I didn't like it, I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Just like trying not to force people to see the suffering in the world and how to alleviate their own pain with Buddhism, the people that didn't like \"Grey\" are the ones who you wouldn't discuss religion or politics with, because they have their solid viewpoint and they refuse to look at the world any other way. The kind of people who seem to always be jealous of their friends and are never happy for anyone else, because they are unhappy. See, that's what these books bring out in me. They want me to show people the path to enlightenment even though that's a path everybody has to find on their own.The books are very original and inventive if you know what you are reading. They have such a believable Zen feel. You want more of each character's thoughts and views. The overall story is just a fast paced action thriller, but when you look deeper you see plausible science and philosophy put in an applicable daily setting. \"Imagine no religion.\""}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20896354-christine", "userReview": "I thought Grey was a little wordy in places and I really had to use my Kindle's dictionary feature. Which was cool because I know it's there but I rarely get the chance to use it. The back and forth flow was really cool! I like the TV show LOST and the backstory and then current story reminded me of the first couple of seasons of LOST when the show was still fresh and made more sense than the end. I'm not a religious person. I don't go to church or believe in God. The idea of the Balance and the Source of life as something outside of human understanding was something I really liked. Grey gave me an idea of an afterlife I could believe in. It explained all the weird shit that happens but we don't have explanations for and contrary to most of the other women readers my age I get tired of the gratuitous sex in fiction.

Too often life is viewed in terms of good and evil, black or white, and the balance point tipping in either direction is ignored. Why should the afterlife be any different? We are given a choice when we die to move on to the Source, stay on earth and slowly evolve into more of what we were (good people become angels and bad people become demons), or a chosen few can work to keep the Balance between them. The title character Grey is such a warrior who works to maintain that balance. He wishes to retire by moving onto the next phase of existence (the Source), so he needs to train a replacement. Grey recruits Pete to learn how to destroy demons and when necessary smack angels around to keep them in line. With help from an eclectic crew of other metaphysical \u201cpolicemen and women, like the no nonsense Raven,\u201d Grey and Pete stop the biblical demon Legion from destroying a small town in Illinois, setting off a chain reaction that could upset the balance in this supernatural buddy cop comedy.The novel is written in two styles. Each chapter begins in a soliloquy from the title character Grey, where he tells pieces of his back-story intertwined with philosophical muses in his western argot that pertain to the subsequent chapter. Said chapter is then told in a third person narrative.", "title": "Grey: The Balance: Book One\n      \n          (The Balance)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12925357-grey", "average": 4.55, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327928162l/12925357.jpg", "reviews": 59, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5286911.Nick_Shamhart", "name": "Nick Shamhart"}], "type": ["Humor", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Paranormal", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12925357-grey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12925267-grey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13548255-raven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17410363-the-fog-within", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15799433-zeus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16194056-the-knight-s-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18488872-gabe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213061-leviathan-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
