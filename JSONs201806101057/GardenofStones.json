The tour also featured a twenty-minute film depicting the events of what had happened that day. And as I looked around the auditorium while the harrowing movie played out, I couldn't help but wonder what was going through the minds and the consequent emotions as they watched the film. I didn't - couldn't - hazard a guess.I've always wondered what had happened to the Japanese-Americans in the States after Pearl Harbor. World History in High School was a little bereft. I didn't know that they were taken in internment camps. While I was reading this book, a history buff at the office told me that it also happened in Canada and the Japanese- Canadians pretty much suffered the same fates as their American counterparts.This book tells the story of a mother and daughter whose delicate beauty made them easy targets for unwanted attention. When I picked up this book, I was already feeling the heavy dread weighing in my gut. I'm not very good at reading anything that would depict torture, abuse, and most of all, rape. I think I read this book with my eyes half-covered. Thankfully, I soon found out that I was worrying for nothing. It wasn't that disturbing, to be honest. Sure the conditions at the camp was severe, the food atrocious, and the treatment of the prisoners were what can be considered now as violations against human rights. But Sophie Littlefield didn't really delve too much into the camp life; in fact, she sort of just glanced over it.The story of Miyako and Lucy Takeda was equal parts heartbreaking, pitiful and poignant. The then recently widowed had to endure the grief of losing the gentlest, most caring husband to uprooting what was left of her family to a place where she'd had to live out the horror of what kind of evil men would do to covet her beauty. The core of the premise is really how far and how much would a mother endure to protect her child. And Miyako did everything she could even so far as to doing the unimaginable.Lucy Takeda's story was just as difficult but not nearly as heartbreaking as her mother's. I guess in the end, and despite the trying life Lucy has had as an orphan, Miyako's sacrifice had been fruitful nonetheless. Lucy was at a tender age when they moved to Manzanar. There, in the camp, she found and lost her first love. When the terrible tragedy struck, a nun took care of her until she begged to leave and find a life for her own. Her story, and how she found and yet again, lost her second love began at a motel owned by a feuding siblings.I think the most frustrating of all is Lucy's lack of voice. She was like her mother - self sacrificing. But where Miyako's capitulations stemmed out of desperation, Lucy's wasn't because she lacked hope and solution. I think she could've fought for Garvey; she could've fought for her happy ending. She folded onto herself and it was because of her love for Garvey that she accepted the things that were thrown her way.The suspense that the murder mystery the book started with will keep you turning the pages. But the mother's and daughter's past lives will keep you entranced until you find yourself no longer caring for the outcome of the crime that had happened in the beginning of the novel. Sophie Littlefield's account for the lives of the prisoners wasn't really that detailed so I can't say whether or not it was done accurately. I also couldn't discount it just because I don't know much about it. My point is, I found that aspect of the book muted because I got too caught up with Lucy's and Miyako's stories. The author also spun some pretty fascinating and surprising twists into the story but what it lacked is the ability to conjure tears and emotions for a book that tackled delicate issues."}, {"userName": "Tracee Gleichner", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5057403-tracee-gleichner", "userReview": "I started reading this book without knowing what it was about \u2013 I had downloaded it on my Kindle and without the book cover and synopsis (it was downloaded from Net Galley), I started reading it one night just by chance. And I am so extremely glad that I did!This is the story of Lucy Takeda, a young girl who was a Japanese American during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The review is going to contain some spoilers \u2013 fair warning!The story starts with a murder accusation \u2013 detectives show up at Lucy\u2019s house looking to speak to her about the murder of someone Lucy knew years ago, someone from the Manzanar camp she was in. Was he a friend of hers? Absolutely not, as a matter of fact Lucy despised and feared him as a girl, but was it enough to make her kill him?Lucy and her mother, Miyako, led a privileged life. Lucy\u2019s father owned his own business and was well respected in the community. Lucy knew how fortunate she was to have such nice clothes and belongings, she also knew that she had the most beautiful mother around. Miyako was a woman that would turn heads whenever she went out. She took great care and pride in her appearance and it showed. Lucy was lucky enough to take after her mother when it came to her looks, she loved her father but he was average in looks and much older than her mother. She married him because he made her feel safe, and you are led to believe that her looks have made her feel as if this is something she needed badly. There are rumblings in the community on unrest between the US and Japan and Lucy starts to tension at school. She sees her father struggle with his health and unfortunately it gets the better of him and he passes.Not too long after this, Lucy and her mother are taken to Manzanar \u2013 a camp that has been constructed for Japanese Americans. And to say that the accommodations were below par would be an understatement. Sleeping on cots in buildings constructed from scrap lumber and thrown together, the desert sand not only blows through the sides of the building, but also through the floorboards. The food is almost inedible and the bathroom facilities are embarrassing and don\u2019t work the majority of the time. But, being resilient, Lucy tries to make the best of her situation. Her mother takes more time, but she too eventually starts to act like her old self, wearing make up, doing her hair, and dressing well. She also decides to apply for a job that she is well qualified for and gets it. Even though she is qualified, she isn\u2019t hired by the staff due to her talents, but more for her looks. And when she starts to come home with bruises on her body, Lucy begins to wonder what is really going on. When she is confronted by her mothers \u2018friend\u2019, and he tells her he will be seeing her soon, her mother takes drastic action to make sure that nothing will EVER happen to Lucy \u2013 her beauty has been a curse for her her entire life, she will not allow her daughter to be in the same position.This is a story that brought so many emotions \u2013 not knowing much about what happened to the Japanese Americans during the war, I was appalled to read the conditions they were kept in. It broke my heart to read about Lucy and her mother and when you find out about Lucy\u2019s friendship with Jessie, and her relationship with Garvey\u2026wow. Again, my heart ached for her as she never seemed to catch a break and be truly happy like she should have been able to. But, would the things that haunted her past be enough to drive her to murder? You\u2019ll just have to read to find out.I absolutely LOVED this book, and was so thrilled that I picked it to read. If you have read it, I would love to hear your thoughts!"}, {"userName": "Leea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2181877-leea", "userReview": "What Lucy had was a tiny seed inside her, a hard thing like a popcorn kernel. But Lucy's Kernel - she didn't know where it was located exactly, in her heart perhaps, or more likely in her spirit, wherever that might be found - would explode large as well. She didn't want much - a place of her own someday, a job of her choosing. But she meant to have it. And when she finally exploded, no one would ever be able to take her future from her again.\nGarden of Stones is the story of Miyako and Lucy Takeda... what happens to them when the world shifts and Japanese Americans are put into concentration camps not long after Pearl Harbor is bombed. The day to day struggle when your life shifts from being an upper middle class citizen to having most of your belongings taken away and you freedom evoked. At the same time there is this murder mystery taking place in the more present time, 1978. The past shapes the future but what happened to Lucy that has changed her life forever? This is not my first novel by  Sophia Littlefield in fact I would call myself a fan of her work. Which is so diverse that when I saw she was writing a novel about he Japanese American experience during WWII I had to read it. I know what took place in that black mark of American History because of a family friend who was born in an internment camp. So the horrors that Miyako and Lucy would endure were not far from my mind. I was prepared to have my heart broken and believe me it did but what I was not prepared for was at the end of this book... the last page the last word to feel for Lucy in such a way that I almost felt her pain. Not even her pain, but her choices, those decisions that lead to where she ended up. Her little life carved out of pain, hurt, violence and injustice. Such a little thing, what Lucy wanted. No more than any other girl in this county or the world. But for her, it seemed like she was reaching for the stars.  Sophia Littlefield wrote Garden of Stones from the view of Lucy, 14 years old and taken for everything she knows. Her view on the world is muted by her age and her fears are those of a 14 year old girl. How will she make friends? What will she occupy her time doing? She's beautiful, pale, and smooth like her mother, Miyoko who has seen the horrors this world can give a beautiful women before. Those horrors come back to haunt Miyoko and she does everything in her power to protect her developing daughter. There is nothing a mother wont do to protect her children a theme that  Ms. Littlefield has explored in her other books and that is revealed in this one. Those choices made, layed the groundwork for Lucy's whole life... She wonders the world with this quiet fire. Never letting anyone even Lucy's daughter, Patty know her truths. I found myself glued to the pages of Garden of Stones with tears in my eyes and a prayer in my heart for Lucy. In the end, I believe Lucy got what she wanted, something small for herself and I was glad for that. It was a more real life ending than anything, true to the character in this book. I cannot help but want more for Lucy but also see how this was all she ever wanted.Garden of Stones felt like two books in one package, yes the stories are very much related but I couldn't help but feel there seporation. There was this unnatural mix of internment and taxidermy (I don't mean for this to be funny, it's true).  Ms. Littlefield writes Lucy's journey from the concentration camp to her job as a maid as a sort of transition between her life of a child and the life she will make for herself. Garden of Stones is beautifully written, well researched and full of twists and turns. In the end I was left with this overwhelming feeling of sadness. For those who endured and forever where changed. \nAnd so it was Lucy who walked with Patty today, Holding tightly to her daughter's arm, unsteady in her satin shoes, trying to ignore the people starting at her. The alter seemed a mile away. I can, I can, I can, Lucy repeated in her mind, just like a hundred other times, and before long they arrived.\nThanks - http://badassbookreviews.com/ for this book :)Children of the Camps and From a Silk Cocoon:http://www.fromasilkcocoon.com/crew.html"}, {"userName": "M.J.

Is it well written (prose/language wise)? Yes. About these things, I'm certain. What I had a bit of a problem with was the style - more specifically, I think the author had difficulty choosing one. The first half of the book is a solid, gritty, real family drama, set mostly against the backdrop of a World War II Japanese American Internment camp. Lucy Takeda is a fourteen year old Japanese American girl who is in the middle of the eighth grade when Pearl Harbour is attacked. Just before this, her father dies suddenly, leaving her already emotionally fragile mother, who suffered traumas at her daughter's age that she never discusses with anyone, almost broken. The other children at school distance themselves from her, or openly taunt her, and on the day of her father's funeral, all people of Japanese American heritage are interned at a camp in the mountains. The abuses that her mother suffers at the hands of the American officers who run the camp tear away at what little grip Miyako has until the prospect of her daughter suffering her fate leads her to do something so unspeakable, it literally made me shriek. After this MASSIVE twist, however, the story changes tack, and descends slightly into melodrama, (ugh!). Then, right near the end (and I am talking the last chapter here), it kicks back into gear again and hits us with not one, not two, but three more plot twists, each one more astounding than the last. At first, I found this annoying (I could just picture this part of the story being read out to an astonished group of party guests by Agatha Christie's all-too-predictable Inspector Cleusau). The twists seemed tacked on and way too coincidental to believe, but then Littlefield justifies them with the real, subtly dramatic style with which she began Lucy's story. Overall, it is a very enjoyable read, but I would have to say that the first half is better executed than the second."}, {"userName": " Marple", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25267726-marple", "userReview": "Actual rating is 3.5 stars.I have a mixed feelings regarding this book. I liked it specially this is the first time i read about the Japanese -American war.This book made me want to read more about this topic.So many things covered in this book such as Motherhood, family bonds , sacrifice, rape and children abuse. And how beauty can be a curse and attract unwanted attention.Thank god the rape and abuse scenes were very light and not descriptive because I don't have the heart to deal with those sensitive topics.The writing was very simple and the mystery factor was unnecessary in my opinion because it was very weak and undeveloped.I hoped to get more from this book and i feel I couldn't get the full picture.I will be reading for the same topic very soon.\nThis book recommended to historical fiction fans."}, {"userName": "Shelleyrae at Book'd Out", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1607230-shelleyrae-at-book-d-out", "userReview": "When the police come to question Lucy Takeda regarding a murder, she is forced to reveal the past she has kept secret from her daughter for nearly forty years. In 1942, Lucy was an intelligent, pretty fourteen year old mourning the recent death of her father, when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour and all US residents with Japanese ancestry were forcibly 'relocated' to camps established for the duration of the war. Sent with her mother, the beautiful but mercurial, Miyako, to a camp in California's desert, the mother and daughter are forced to endure the trials of corruption, injustice and tragedy.Garden of Stones is a moving, emotional story of loss, prejudice, love and survival. Flashbacks reveal the harrowing experiences of Lucy and her mother in the poorly constructed and under resourced internment camp. While the prisoners did their best to create some semblance of a normal life during their interment, Littlefield describes overflowing toilets, badly prepared food and a shocking lack of privacy, conditions thousands of internee's were forced to endure for years. It's a confronting historical circumstance post-WW2 generations are largely ignorant of and the author portrays the situation with compassionate honesty.After the shock of arrival at Manzanar, Lucy's natural optimism and energy asserts itself and she works as a courier while attending the camp school. Still mired in grief it is weeks before Miyako, urged on by her sister in law, shakes of her debilitative depression to begin work as a seamstress in the camp factory. Lucy is overjoyed that her mother is finally adjusting to life within the camp until her innocence is shattered when she learns the emotionally fragile Miyako, is being forced to submit to the sickening desires of the camp officials. Unable to extricate herself from the officer's attentions Miyako is led to commit a desperate act that will change everything for Lucy.Lucy is such a lovely child, spirited, smart and resilient, so the contrast with her adult self in the dual time narrative is unbearably poignant, even though at times I felt it was intrusive. For Lucy's daughter Patty, to whom Lucy is an enigma, understanding her mother's early life becomes key to absolving her of the present murder. As she uncovers her mother's past she is stunned by the revelations, though there are still many secrets that Lucy keeps, as a mother determined to protect her child. Well written, with wonderful characterisation and an intriguing storyline, Garden of Stones is a heartbreaking, fascinating and poignant tale of struggle and survival whose bittersweet ending haunts you long after the final page is turned."}, {"userName": "Judith Starkston", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4596767-judith-starkston", "userReview": "When we think of internment camps and WWII, we don\u2019t think of California, Arizona and Utah, but we should. Sophie Littlefield\u2019s upcoming book, Garden of Stones, which moves between WWII and the 1970\u2019s, draws us into this shameful chapter of US history after the bombing of Pearl Harbor\u2014the rounding up, financial ruin, and forcible detention of Japanese Americans in desolate camps. I remember attending an exhibit in the early 70\u2019s of photographs and artwork from the camps\u2014a book of that exhibit is still around, Executive Order 9066\u2014because my father was an historian and he\u2019d helped put it together. I had a jarring sense that this piece didn\u2019t work in my limited teen framework of history. How could we have done this? It stank so much of the behavior on the other side of the Atlantic we\u2019d fought to stop. Any good book set in this particular historical moment would be worthwhile. There have been several earlier ones such as Farewell to Manzanar. Sophie Littlefield\u2019s novel does an outstanding job of depicting a heartbreaking view of this national failure of conscience. For example, she interweaves into her plot the orphanages that had been relocated to the camp. Did we really fear the espionage of infants so much that we endangered their well being in order to lock them up? But Sophie\u2019s book accomplishes more than a vivid reminder of this chapter of history. Littlefield portrays three generations of women, a mother, daughter and granddaughter, of such depth and idiosyncratic character that it would not matter when or where the book was set, we would read on to feel these three lives vibrate with tragedy, inner strength, mental delusion, and peculiar joys. Littlefield\u2019s entwining of these particular lives within the historical details makes for smart, mind-bending reading that you can\u2019t put down. There\u2019s a murder mystery at its plot center, but this book is so full of human crisis and coping that the murder becomes only one of many pieces broken loose by this tale\u2019s full-spate river. We are compelled to consider the rights and wrongs of actions so much more anguished and subtle than simply why our government locked up law-abiding citizens (valuable as that reminder alone would be). Garden of Stones tugs us along through mental illness, rape, sexual abuse, bigotry, and the ambiguous but powerful bonds between mothers and daughters. Perhaps most of all, this book provides a nuanced portrayal of the nature of forgiveness and acceptance."}, {"userName": "Marcie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1359040-marcie", "userReview": "Perhaps my review of this book is colored by the fact that I had just finished reading another book about the Japanese internment camps, but I did not like this book as much as I expected to. The story starts with a murder when Lucy is an adult, then flashes back to Lucy's life as a child, then flashes forward and back again several times. I found myself much more interested in Lucy's life as a child in the internment camp, and so the murder investigation in the flash-forward times seemed distracting and even unrelated until the very end of the story. And although Lucy was a strong and likeable character as a child, she didn't seem to have a voice at all in the flash-forward parts of the story, and so it was hard to get a sense of her as an adult. While I expect that the troubles Lucy and her mother encountered in the camp were depressingly possible, I found her story too bleak and the ending too hopeless to make this book enjoyable to me."}, {"userName": "Keri", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2335749-keri", "userReview": "Why I rated a SL 3 stars. This was a well written book, no doubt. But the subject matter made it a very tough read. The bulk of the book takes place during WWII when we see our fellow Japanese Americans taken away from their lives and put them into camps like cattle. Of course you know what happens when you get oppressed people and a completely uncaring government. You get men who think nothing of abusing the people under their care. That is the story we have here and it was very emotional as we see Lucy's world through her teenage eyes. An HEA for Lucy would have went along way with me and bumped my stars. But SL has stated before she doesn't write romance so I shouldn't have been surprised at the ending, but gosh darn it I was.

The first chapter anticipates the murder of an old man. The second chapter introduces Patty Takeda and her mother Lucy. Patty, visiting her mother in the days leading up to her (Patty\u2019s) wedding, wakes to find Lucy having an early morning chat with a police inspector. Lucy is being questioned because she knew the victim decades prior, and neighborhood residents placed her at the scene. With her horrible facial scaring, she\u2019s hard to miss. The third chapter is where the novel\u2019s structure becomes apparent. It flashes us back to the Los Angeles of 1941.Having just met the caustic older Lucy, we are now introduced to the stunningly beautiful adolescent version. This privileged young girl is about to suffer a series of blows leading up to the United States\u2019 entry into the war. Her Japanese heritage is suddenly a huge liability. From there, the novel moves back and forth in time between the events of 1978 and those in the 1940\u2019s\u2014with the bulk of the tale occurring in the past. Lucy is sent to the Manzanar internment camp, along with her family, friends, and neighbors. It is events that occurred at Manzanar that directly cultivated the woman Lucy was to become\u2014and perhaps to the murder that has occurred.Now, I have been a fan of Ms. Littlefield\u2019s for years, and I love the sheer breadth and depth of what she writes from comic mysteries to zombie apocalypses. The set-up above seems like another mystery, but truthfully, it\u2019s more of a historic drama. The subject of Japanese internment strikes close to home to me\u2014literally\u2014having spent the past decade living a block from San Francisco\u2019s Japantown. My neighborhood was greatly impacted by this shameful period of California\u2019s history. I think fiction can be a powerful medium for evoking history. Through fiction, stories live on and are humanized. I also think that a lot of research went into this novel, and yet I felt somewhat frustrated by viewing this history through the eyes of an unsophisticated teenage girl. Those flashback sections of the novel had something of a YA feel about them. Now, I have nothing against young adult fiction\u2014I read a ton of it\u2014but here I was hungering for a little more\u2026detail \u2026maturity \u2026 substance. That would be my complaint. That said, I found myself very caught up in the story of these characters. Littlefield writes, \u201cIt was as if her mother had once been an entirely different person, and Patty faulted herself for never having seen far enough into her depths, for not being curious enough to coax out the story until now.\u201d Lucy Takeda lived an extraordinary life in a period of great historic significance. As events led up to what felt like a climax, I realized that I was only at the center of the tale. As Lucy matured, I became more and more invested in her story. The frustration I\u2019d felt earlier in the novel disappeared. Character development has always been Ms. Littlefield\u2019s strength, and that is again the case here. Still, by the time I\u2019d reached the novel\u2019s end, she managed to truly surprise me with a couple of unexpected plot twists. One, in particular, was really cleverly done. Ultimately, the murder that opens this novel is little more than a framing device, but as such it works well. Garden of Stones is a great choice for readers interested in mother-daughter relationships, or who are simply looking for a great story set against a historic backdrop. While it took me a little while to become fully invested in the tale, the deeper I read, the more I enjoyed this novel."}, {"userName": "Eustacia Tan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan", "userReview": "I think in history class, the World War Two narratives were pretty straightforward the Nazi's were all bad (although there was Sophie, who spoke out against them and was killed for it) and the Japanese were all bad. We don't really hear about people like Sophie or Sugihara, who did some truly commendable things. Likewise, we don't hear about things like how the Americans used Japanese body parts to make, ugh, objects (I refuse to list). Or about the concentration-camp-like places that loyal Japanese-Americans were sent to just because of their origin.Apart from Weedflower by Cyntha Kadohata, this is one of those rare books that deal with the Japanese-American experience during World War II. Using a dual-narrative structure, it tells the tale of life just before, during and a little after the concentration camps (of Lucy and her mother), and the murder of a former worker of said camp (dealing with Lucy and her daughter Patty).The camp was horrible. Keeping in mind that these are patriotic Americans, the way they were treated was just terrible. Apart from terrible living conditions, they had to deal with sexual harrassment and obvious prejudice from the White people. I know this is a novel, but I'm pretty sure it's based on real life.Really, this is a haunting story. The story of Lucy and her mother is obviously the main tale, and it's very well-told. The book flowed and I really couldn't put it down. In fact, what broke the flow was, ironically, the secondary plot.The secondary plot is a sort of murder mystery, that is supposed to wrap up the events that happened so long ago. The only problem is that there were leaps that I couldn't follow, which got me confused. Plus, when compared to the power of the camp-narrative, it just lost a lot of attraction.Character-wise, I felt a connection with Lucy much more than Patty. Lucy loved much and lost much, but Patty is just cruising in life. Yes, she does a lot to defend her mother, but she doesn't change that much during the book. She doesn't find out the true circumstances of her birth, and I expected her to come to a conclusion about her fiance in the book. I don't think she loved him (it didn't show), but she still got married to him. I guess they are a happy couple from the start, but it's not very obvious, and without any events, I can't see anything (what I thought was a conflict turned out to be a non-event).But, this is an excellent book. It's a really good look at the infamous war, from a very different perspective.Disclaimer: I got a copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for a free and honest review."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4382238-dawn", "userReview": "There are stories that we Americans are fond of shouting to the sky. Tales of daring, boldness and the great courage in \"making do\" in order to stand on your own two feet. We tell stories of wars, of exploration and the exploits of semi-mythical figures that loom large off the page. We like the stories, they define us, they define the American Dream of making a life a success on one's one terms. But there are also stories we don't tell. Ugly stories, which we (often successfully) try to forget. This is one of those- a story set in a national shame that we have carefully swept under the carpets of time. The internment of Americans Of Japanese Descent during World War II.Some will be hearing of this for the first time. Some will wince away from the slightly dirty feeling memory. Some are followers of George Takei and have heard the story there, and he tells it well. As does Sophie Littlefield; although her story is more fiction than fact, it too holds power.Garden Of Stones is about loss, on it's surface. A girl who slowly loses everything. Her beloved father dead. Her mother lost to grief, her home shut up, and herself taken away and sent to finish growing up in unfinished shacks in the middle of the desert, disconnected from the whole world, but for one boy. But underneath, it shows us faces of evil that mirror our own. The man who threatens and beats a woman to bend her to his will. Callous law enforcement, breaking in on a funeral. The woman so jealous she poisons everything she touches. The hard reality: that we look to the other as holding evil, but it's hidden in our own visages. A well written, fast read, Littlefield evokes the confusion of adolescence perfectly, and manages not to telegraph the plot changes she throws in her protagonist's way. As for the accuracy of her setting, others will have to judge, but her characters ring true. Part of me thinks it could have been longer, with more exploration of the camp itself, but the author's choice keeps the plot from getting bogged down in side-plots. Overall, it's a good read, and worth picking up, particularly for those interested in the period, or in American History in general."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93254-michelle", "userReview": "Lucy is a Japanese teen in the Little Tokyo area of Los Angeles when Pearl Harbor is bombed and she\u2019s moved to an internment camp. I\u2019m fascinated by this time period as I feel American history really glosses over it. We quarantined tens of thousands of people based on race alone, with some shoddy \u201cthey might be spies/infidels/etc.\u201d rhetoric. Meanwhile many of these folks had never been to Japan, didn\u2019t speak Japanese, and saw themselves as nothing but American. Because they were. The confusion young Lucy experiences leading up to her family\u2019s relocation feels authentic (e.g. what, are they talking about? I\u2019m American). Indeed one particularly simple but gripping part had a neighborhood shop with an \u201cI am an American\u201d sign in the window. The theme of identity in this book is compelling and strong, not just as it relates to being an American but in many, many other areas. Really beautifully done.I also loved the commentary on mothers and daughters, parents and children. I definitely teared up on multiple occasions. I also like that some of it took place in Lone Pine \u2013 a town I\u2019ve driven through many times on the way to somewhere else. I\u2019ve always wondered about that little town and the people in it. It was cool to read a version of what might\u2019ve been.The narrative oscillates between Lucy as a teen and Lucy as an older woman with an about-to-be-married daughter. These late 70\u2019s chapters are told through the daughter\u2019s perspective as she tries to unravel the mystery of her mother\u2019s past. I felt like there wasn\u2019t enough here. I wanted more of Patty. She is an interesting character and we don\u2019t get to know her very well. There is a mid-to-late breaking reveal/twist I found fantastic \u2013 one of those turns that is completely unexpected yet makes total sense. However there is a late, late, late twist that I\u2019m not sure about. It was certainly unexpected but I think I would\u2019ve liked the book even more had that not happened. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed this read and was caught up in the heartbreaking tales of these women.

What could you be driven to do, if like Miyako Takeda in Sophie Littlefield\u2019s beautifully rendered and touching novel, Garden of Stones, you knew that, ultimately, you could not be there to protect your young daughter from the horrible assault you know lies in wait for her? The answers to these questions would be difficult enough under ordinary circumstances, during peace time. But for Miyako and her daughter, Lucy, who are imprisoned and subjected to the inhuman treatment those of Japanese descent endured while they were kept in the U.S. interment camps during World War II, the times are anything but ordinary. When the story opens, it is some thirty years later, and a man, an American, who was associated with the camp, is found murdered. It\u2019s a mystery and a source of terrible concern to Patty, Lucy\u2019s daughter, when her mother is implicated. Unaware of much of her mother\u2019s and her grandmother\u2019s painful history, Patty assumes her investigation into the matter will prove her mother\u2019s innocence. But what Patty learns, through a series of shattering revelations, will alter forever her ideas about herself and her courageous and lovely mother and grandmother. In this poignant narrative, a tragic history is recounted, and the true bravery of women and mothers is explored; there is the murder of a man, too. The ending contains unexpected twists, and a haunting question: Who is really responsible? Who committed the more heinous crime?"}, {"userName": "Deborah Ledford", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2286720-deborah-ledford", "userReview": "Let me first say that I am a huge Sophie Littlefield fan. I\u2019ve read almost all of her books, from her riotous Stella Hardesty crime novels, the Aftertime series, and her young adult novels. Ms. Littlefield never fails to keep me flipping the pages. Her latest, GARDEN OF STONES, puts this talented writer on yet another genre list--that of literary author. Prowess and perfection dot these pages, filled with insightful perceptions, lyrical phrasing and most of all, captivating characters I won\u2019t soon forget.This is a complex, multi-cultural tale of survival during and after a terrifying time, revolving around instances I wasn\u2019t fully aware of until now. Historians should applaud Littlefield\u2019s efforts.Following these fascinating multi-generational characters, we leap over any cultural boundaries as the mirror is put up to our own face--not to judge, but rather for us to remember, and dare not repeat our shameful past.For lovers of mysteries, historical fiction, to flat out literary prose, this is a must read."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "3.5 starsI liked this historical fiction novel. It centered around one Japanese family's experience as they were swept away from their comfortable, free American life and taken to the Japanese internment camps.

Sharing the fate of over 120,000 other Japanese Americans, Lucy and her mother Miyako are forced to leave their home to be \u201crelocated\u201d to Manzanar, the first of the ten concentration camps to be established in the US to house these political prisoners. Having been born in America and growing up as the privileged single child of a wealthy American-Japanese businessman, Lucy is a Nisei, a person of Japanese ancestry born in America. She identifies strongly as American, like many other fellow camp inmates with similar backgrounds. Yet they are being treated like prisoners, having to endure harsh living conditions, a total lack of privacy and personal freedom, and being subject to abuse from senior camp officials.Miyako, a strikingly beautiful woman who has been suffering from bouts of depression and mania as long as Lucy can remember, is finding life in the camp especially hard, often staying in bed for days. Left to her own devices, spirited and proactive Lucy soon adapts to her new circumstances and unjust internment, making friends and holding down an after-school position as delivery person in the camp. But when Miyako starts a new job and catches the eye of a cruel and corrupt camp commander, their lives change for the worse. Abused, beaten and broken, Miyako tries to save her daughter from the same fate, committing an act of desperation that will forever shadow Lucy\u2019s future and shape her life in ways she could never have envisaged.Garden of Stones is one of the best books I have read all year, presenting yet another completely different aspect of the effects of WW2 on members of the population. With a keen insight into historical events and human relationships, the author brings this era of history to life in ways that drew me in completely, keeping me spellbound until the last page had been turned. It is impossible not to suffer with Lucy, a plucky, intelligent and spirited child, whose life is completely derailed by large political events as well as corruption and cruelty on a local level. Camp life is realistically portrayed in a way which allowed the reader to see it through the eyes of an adolescent girl and feel the effects of the imposed hardship on Lucy\u2019s personality, making her stronger and more resistant to adversity.Misadventure seems to follow her mother Miyako, drawn in by her exceptional beauty and her damaged psyche. \u201cI am cursed\u201d, Miyako confides to her friend when Lucy\u2019s safety is also threatened, \u201cWe are both cursed. I should never have had her.\u201d Careful not to throw in any spoilers, I will just say that Miyako\u2019s act of desperation to save her daughter from the \u201ccurse\u201d is so extreme, and so unimaginable, that I reeled from the shock of it and put much of it down to Miyako\u2019s fragile state of mind. Surely no mother in her right mind would go to such extremes \u2013 or would they? It is hard to fathom the despair of someone cornered, trying everything in their power to protect their child.Lucy makes a wonderful protagonist, and my heart bled for her. Getting back up again after every knock, overcoming every hardship, Lucy is a person I admired greatly. Yet the older Lucy, who the reader is introduced to in the modern-day segments of the story, seems to have lost a lot of that unlimited positive energy and resilience that defines her in her youth. Only towards the end of the novel the reader is able to understand just how deeply her mother\u2019s \u201ccurse\u201d has affected her, shaping her life and robbing her of the future that should have been due to her young and beautiful self.The dual-time structure of the novel worked well for me, with the modern-day murder mystery initiating the tale of Lucy\u2019s childhood experiences. The historical events form the larger part of the novel, but its modern day components add depth to the characters and slowly reveal the mystery at the heart of the story - which ultimately solves the murder case and reveals much about the characters involved. Lucy\u2019s daughter Patty, so different to the young Lucy we get to know, stays a bit of an enigma all along, but the series of events towards the end of the book provides the big \u201caha\u201d-moment, bringing all loose threads together.For me, Garden of Stones was an evocative, thought provoking and heart-wrenching tale of injustice, suffering, human relationships and the triumph of the human spirit. The story opened my eyes to a part of history I had given little thought to, and its haunting tale will stay with me for a long time.

The book starts in 1978 when one of the former camp officials has been found murdered in San Francisco, and tells the story of Miyako and her daughter Lucy through a series of flashbacks to 1942-1943. In one sense, this is actually two books, one describing a place, time and existence that are, sadly, a factual part of our history, and the second a fictional tale of two Americans women of Japanese heritage who lived in that place and time. The factual account of the camp and it\u2019s conditions is an interesting, though depressing and shameful account, and the fictional tale is mostly so depressing and without hope that the reader begins to wonder if they really want to be reading this book. The saving grace is the brevity of the book, that the characters are likeable (or hate-able in some cases) and fairly credible, and that there are a few genuine surprises in the last chapter that I truly did not see coming.The family is the Takedas, living the good life in Los Angeles in December, 1941. The father, Renjiro, is a successful businessman and has done well for his family, wife Miyako and daughter Lucy. They are wealthier than most other Japanese immigrant families; however that wealth will not protect them from the mistrust and sometimes hatred by the American public when Japanese warplanes bear down on Pearl Harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941. Renjiro himself will not survive that fateful day and dies perhaps from the stress, or perhaps from understanding too well what will follow. Miyako and Lucy will be sent to Manzanar, the internment camp, or concentration camp as some have dubbed it, to the north of Los Angeles. There, their lives intertwine with other prisoners in the same situation, but also with camp officials who have not failed to notice Miyako\u2019s extraordinary beauty, as well as that of her daughter. And the story follows an almost predictable path from there. That said, this is a tale of almost complete hopelessness and devastation of lives. I failed to find a ray of hope or even a small seed of hope for a brighter future, and that is what made this a \u201cthumbs down\u201d book for me. There have been two great shames in the history of the United States: our treatment immigrant slaves and their ancestors, African-Americans, throughout our brief history, and our treatment of Japanese immigrants and Americans of Japanese heritage after Pearl Harbor and in the following years. This is a tale of the latter and while it is a fictional tale, there is much presumably well-researched historical content of the Manzanar camp during that period. Manzanar did exist, housing more than 11,000 at its height. Conditions at the camp were not good: cramped quarters, inadequate warm clothing, insufficient and poorly prepared food, and unfinished barracks with dust constantly blowing in through the cracks. This novel outlines serious abuses of the prisoners which may or may not have actually happened, but given the elements of human nature, most likely is not too far a stretch of the imagination. This book paints a fairly vivid picture of the camp, however if one is genuinely interested, I would recommend Farewell to Manzanar, a memoir by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston published in 1973."}, {"userName": "Sam Still Reading", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162915-sam-still-reading", "userReview": "Garden of Stones is a different book to what I was expecting from the cover \u2013 and I mean that in a good way. I thought the book would be about a mother with a young daughter struggling in an internment camp. While the book does highlight the struggles of Lucy (a teenager, older than the girl on the cover) and her mother, this story is a gripping, heart wrenching one of love and sacrifice. There are scenes that will cause you to gasp in horror, shake your head in disgust at brutal cruelty and weep at the power of love.Garden of Stones has a dual narrative (fast becoming one of my favourite types of reads) and Littlefield executes it beautifully. We see Lucy Takeda and her mother Miyako forced to abandon their home for the Manzanar internment camp. This world is different to what either of them have known. While Lucy adapts somewhat, making friends and getting a part time job, Miyako becomes depressed. Later she is forced to do things that she can never share with Lucy, nor does she want Lucy to suffer a similar fate.In 1978, Lucy\u2019s daughter, Patty is getting ready for her wedding when police inform her that her mother is a potential suspect in a murder case. The dead man was a guard at Manzanar, but Patty knows little about this life. Little by little, Lucy\u2019s story is revealed.I haven\u2019t read a book before that dealt with the Japanese-American view of World War II. Littlefield portrays their awkward position very well \u2013 they are American, but being treated as the enemy. It is a grim period of history that should be talked about more so the same mistakes are not repeated. Manzanar is described in great detail \u2013 from the streets to the tiny gardens offering a sense of normality in cold, bare living conditions.This story also asks the question \u2013 how far would you go for your daughter \u2013 or for your mother? Lucy, Miyako and Patty all make great sacrifices in an attempt to protect their loved one. In Miyako\u2019s case, it was somewhat extreme (I\u2019m not going to spoil the scene) but it does ask \u2013 where do you draw the line? Were there other options?Despite the bleakness of the setting and the severity of the subject matter, Littlefield writes characters that are easy to relate to and empathise with. Lucy, the main character, is someone I felt very sympathetic to given the struggles she had faced in her young life at Manzanar and afterwards. Patty seemed to be more of a product of the 1970s \u2013 she was lighter and more casual, but still had a backbone of steel when it mattered. Don\u2019t we all when it comes to family?There are also happy, loving moments in this novel and the overall feeling of love was strong. I enjoyed this book (reading late into the night) and was surprised to see that Littlefield has written very different genres prior to this! She\u2019s a natural at this kind of historical fiction.Thank you to Harlequin Australia for providing me with a copy of this great book!"}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "When I first picked up Garden of Stones, I thought the author's name sounded familiar, and it was only when I was more than halfway through that I realised she is the author of the zombie / post-apocalyptic Aftertime series. I haven't read Aftertime, but I was impressed at how versatile an author Ms. Littlefield is - after all, zombies and historical fiction are two of my favourite genres but are as pretty much far apart as genre's can be.Garden of Stones is not an overly sympathetic book. There are some shocking events within the pages, a mystery and characters that are quite hard to break through the surface of, but Ms. Littlefield maintains an objective view without falling into dramatics.The story is told in alternating POV's - Lucy's story just before, during and just after her internmet at Manzanar, and Lucy's daughter Patty's POV in the late 1970's. Both are difficult characters to get to know - Lucy's experiences have made her a closed, secretive character, and although I didn't have a particular issue with Patty, I also didn't find her overly engaging, and it was only very late in the book that I actually liked her as a character. However, Patty's part in the story is only as a connector, and the vast majority of the book is set in the 1940s.But I can see what the author was trying to achieve with the characters, in creating an air of mystery it is inevitable that the characters are harder to get to know - it's not really possible to have one without the other. Especially Lucy, it's not that she's an unlikeable character at all, and in fact is very brave and admirable, but forming a connection with her was difficult.Overall I really enjoyed Garden of Stones, and reading about a subject that is not often explored in books, and Sophie Littlefield's storytelling matched perfectly with the plot and characters.Read more of my reviews at The Aussie Zombie"}, {"userName": "Amantha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4939550-amantha", "userReview": "Like almost every American student of my generation, I had to read \"Farewell to Manzanar\" for school; in my case, 7th grade. I was twelve, and to be honest I remember nothing about the book other than how depressing it was. Manzanar was a travesty, a horrific aspect of American history that they teach us about in order to make sure we don't repeat our mistakes. When we went to war against \"terrorism,\" Americans may have felt like putting people of Middle Eastern heritage in concentration camps, but they didn't. Because I guess Americans can occasionally learn from their mistakes. I know, I'm shocked too.When a man is murdered at his place of work, Lucy Takeda becomes a suspect in his death. She knew him from Manzanar, though she claims she hasn't seen him in years. A witness, however, places her at the scene of the crime shortly after it was committed. Lucy's daughter, against her mother's wishes, starts her own investigation into what this man meant to Lucy, and ends up getting more than she bargained for. Told largely through flashbacks, we learned of the abuse Lucy and her mother, Miyako, suffered while at the camp, and then later when Lucy leaves to work at a nearby motel. It's a story of the power of beauty, and how that power can become a detriment rather than a benefit.Occasionally I got frustrated with some of the characters and their actions. Additionally the resolution of the murder case felt altogether too contrived and easy. But the murder wasn't the point, the abuse and horror suffered was.

Maybe it was the writing style, but it was definitely a page-turner. And maybe because we didn't know too much of the intimate tragic details of what really happened during this period, it was possible to focus more on the role of women and the survival struggle of Lucy Takeda. Sophie Littlefield is such a thoughtful and engaging writer - her descriptions of the internment camp really took me there and it was compelling. I could envision Lucy navigating the camps quite easily (I may have been influenced by the couple of visits I've done to see concentration camps in Germany). In any case, I was truly interested in the whole plot and was wondering about some of Sophie's decisions of not resolving a storyline in her book. The one thing that I couldn't grasp as much is the Japanese culture as such. I'm sure this played a lot into the choices the Japanese women took in this particular book.

Back in the 1940s, if you were in the US but had Japanese ancestry, they assumed you were an enemy, a spy, or whatever false accusation they could come up with. And thus so many innocent civilians were stolen from their lives and dumped into \"internment camps\". I don't even know what that means, but the very fact they existed screams of racial profiling, prejudice, and all that other awful stuff.The Pearl Harbor bombing and the unrelated death of Renjiro Takeda changes little Lucy Takeda's life forever.

It is a moving chronicle of injustice, triumph and the unspeakable acts we commit in the name of love.\u00a0\"Littlefield has a gift for pacing...page-turning action and evocative, sensual, harrowing descriptions.\" -Publishers Weekly", "title": "Garden of Stones", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15731876-garden-of-stones", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349137873l/15731876.jpg", "reviews": 466, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2949152.Sophie_Littlefield", "name": "Sophie Littlefield"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "War", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15731876-garden-of-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16082913-garden-of-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9065272-aftertime", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7488686-banished", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6515329-a-bad-day-for-sorry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10322436-rebirth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12109352-horizon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
