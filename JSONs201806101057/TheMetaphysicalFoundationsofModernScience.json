First, Terry's older sister Jan was there. I had dated her briefly several years prior and the charm was not gone. Second, Bob, another friend, even more charmed, had driven up to be close to Jan. She did not want to be close to him. I don't recall him leaving the car. Third, there were dogs, big dogs. Fourth, the cottage had recently been inadvertantly burned down and everyone was staying, with the dogs and some bicycles, in a playhouse built by Bill and his dad during Bill's childhood. It was cramped. Terry was with Bill. Jan moved in on Martin. I moved to the pier on the lake.And, as one does at such times, I turned to philosophy, namely E.A. Burtt's doctoral dissertation on the faith assumptions originally motivating and currently underlying the physical sciences--a book which I find has had considerable impact on my subsequent thinking about the sciences. Of all the books I've read since about the origins of the contemporary physical sciences, this study of its axiomatic assumptions is the best."}, {"userName": "the gift", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3403278-the-gift", "userReview": "this is a later addition: i can see through this summary how husserl was so interested in putting philosophy on a scientific basis, how he could be, as our entire western culture, so convinced this is the way of thinking not 'theoretical', not 'experimental', but source of way of thinking that describes an ontology of being always already in the world by referring to what we experience. this is 'phenomenon'. this is why husserl calls phenomenology the 'first science'... but this also reflects concerns that by 'mathematization' we are deleting an aspect of life. though in this book there is an awareness of this limiting effect. 'mathematization' is what early continental philosophers contend with, a belief the way of natural science thinking is not the way to understand the world, only as cartesian coordinates of x, y, on a graph. continental thought recognizes how left, right, before, behind, are perspective 'lived world', but all this is a challenge rather than reason to discard analytic science thought unless you are heidegger...first review: my knowledge of science- as it is defined here, 'natural science' meaning mostly physics- is in many ways advanced beyond my knowledge of poetry, but both as theory, not practice. i have never thought or worked as a scientist. so this is a rating perhaps from experienced ignorance, but it reflects how this work stimulates further interests even as it summarizes how we got to this thought space, that of 'modern science', in opposition to classical greek and roman and its varied strands throughout the middle ages. this is 'western science'. this is itself a historical document, from 1924, and explicates this worldview along the lines of biographies of great men...starting with copernicus, kepler, galileo, descartes, on to hobbes, more, gilbert, boyle, all leading to newton, this biographical order happens to be that of great ideas, order to much of which i am not familiar. my cosmological history is simply that through the centuries, man has gradually diminished in models of how the universe worked. how qualities of scholaticism were overcome by quantities of science...i have always had copernicus and kepler conflated- copernicus was more theoretician, bothered that orbits of the planets as defined by ptolemy, with the earth at the centre, required too many circles upon circles. kepler took this idea and searched for experimental evidence, receiving much from tycho brahe. no, with the level of tech available, predictions and descriptions by the heliocentric model were not really more accurate, but the idea had the beauty of simplicity...galileo is the man who devised tech by which such modern cosmology could be examined, though at least as important, he was the one who could unify the glory, order, eternal beauty, of the heavens, with the rather more messy confusion of our terrestrial world. proving copernicus accurate was not only moving man from the centre, the purpose, the religious duty, of the universe- but also uniting little mankind with the sublime, awesome, patterns of the heavens...descartes, as the previous names, did some science, but it is his philosophy that resonates, that animates, for the entire history of modern science. famously, he advanced doubt as a method, the first meditation the 'i think therefore i am', and this is perhaps the beginning of displacing a christian god, from the creating and guiding of all the complexities of the universe. physical science promises to do everything by regular laws, though it is not surprising to see these europeans insist god behind it all, even if no longer final cause (why the universe) but only efficient cause (how the universe)...hobbes and more, leading to gilbert and boyle, are less interesting to me. the only part where physics is not solely the 'modern science' which this book describes the founding, adding some 'physical chemistry'- but primarily this is fascinating to read arguments, hear disputes, between this and that natural philosopher. they had no facebook, but it seems like everyone knew everyone and there was no lack of correspondence... all of which leads to the biggest name, the final name, so dominant the term 'modern science' could be named after him alone, this is where authors of this book most clearly show the rising divide between science and philosophy...newton is worth the long chapter given him, and certainly i can see how modern scientists can be so impatient if his genius is not acknowledged, for this entire book is a good story, an engaging narrative, and he is here the model of scientist. so there may be some doubt towards his thought, there is apparently some frustration that he, no more than galilleo, wrote little about how he came up with science answering such a wide range of physical experience, wrote little about how he decided what he studied, wrote some rather unscientific work as enthusiastically- this being to aver to god all teleological difficulty, as well as what we consider pseudosciences, like alchemy...so newton was not perfect. but what he did come up with! starting with his fourfold progression of concepts, his 'rules': simplicity (no more than this), identical causality (same effects must derive from same causes), universality (all like this), validity (empirical truth)... yes, he tended towards philosophy, to metaphysics, when he was not looking... and then through his 'method', which he would not call 'hypothetical deduction' (hypothesis is a big no for newton), by which he came to believe proof of his rules, here three: simplification of what examined (no more than this), mathematization (transforming real into math such as calculus- where i started to discover i would not be a scientist) and experimental verification (not hypothetical but actual)...this book ends with a modest chapter summing up where metaphysics of 'modern science' has brought us, throughout the world, in all cultures, in the early 20th century not much different from in the early 21st century. the author holds out the promise the story is not yet over, as any work building on it will make a great sequel- though he is writing from 1924, the aspiration to see such remarkable progress in the 'human sciences' still seems current, and likely as frustrated. but then maybe this is what philosophers are for, this is what artists are for..."}, {"userName": "K", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8642635-k", "userReview": "I am quite baffled by the fact that I had never heard of Burtt's book in my prior discussions of 20th-century post-positivist philosophy of science. This book is primarily a competent refutation of the positivist doctrine by means of an analysis of the metaphysics of 17th century thinkers. Secondly, it is a historical inquiry on the emergence of modern scientific metaphysics. Burtt's study begins with Copernicus and his first seeds of a mathematisation of the world, and culminates in Newton's theological conclusions and the latter's divinisation of space. One of Burtt's main arguments is that despite appearances, the Aristotelian metaphysics of essence, substance and quality were not discarded in favour of a positivist worldview, but were rather replaced by the metaphysics of mass, time, and space. An important defect of the new metaphysics, however, was a separation of minds from the world of sense experience. More specifically, the Galilean doctrine of primary and secondary qualities (as well as its subsequent evolution in French and British natural philosophy) sets the stage for dualism: on the one hand, the world is intrinsically geometrical; on the other hand, minds resist mathematical treatment. As the French historian of science Alexander Koyre once wrote, \"[t]wo worlds: this means two truths. Or no truth at all.\""}, {"userName": "Ali", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23073617-ali", "userReview": "\u062f\u0648 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062a\u063a\u06cc\u06cc\u0631 \u0645\u0633\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0634\u06cc\u062f\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0648 \u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0645\u06cc \u0647\u0645 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0628\u06af\u0631\u062f\u0647\u0627"}, {"userName": "Ali Al-ismail", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36755822-ali-al-ismail", "userReview": "\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0636\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u062a\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0636\u0645\u0646\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0641\u0647\u0648\u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b. \u0639\u0628\u0631 \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0633\u0627\u0647\u0645\u062a \u0641\u064a \u062a\u063a\u064a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0641\u0647\u0648\u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0646\u060c \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0643\u0648\u0628\u0631\u0646\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0633\u060c \u063a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0644\u0648\u060c \u062f\u064a\u0643\u0627\u0631\u062a\u060c \u0648\u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0623\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u064a\u0648\u062a\u0646\u060c \u064a\u0648\u0636\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u062a\u0637\u0648\u0631 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0636\u0627\u062a \u0644\u062a\u0635\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0634\u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0646\u062f \u0646\u064a\u0648\u062a\u0646."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james", "userReview": "In my Junior year at The University of Wisconsin I took a History of Science survey course and, while Burtt's book was not on the syllabus, I read this book as additional reading for the class. This classic provides a thoughtful overview and analysis of the shift from the medieval to modern view of man's place in the universe. In doing so it examines the works of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Gilbert, Boyle, Newton, and others. Both a criticism and a history of the changing world view due to the revolution in science experienced during the lives of those thinkers, it assists in understanding both their methods and accomplishments.

I would have given this book 5 stars, were it not for the last chapter dedicated to Newton. Everything that comes before leads up to Newton who, we are told, is the culmination of the new metaphysics introduced by Copernicus and carried along different paths by Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Hobbes, et al. All the preceding chapters dedicated to these thinkers are thoroughly fascinating, especially the first two, in which the divergence with Greek and medieval metaphysics can be seen more clearly. And because there are many contributors to early modern science, we get only a brief overview of their main metaphysical commitments, which makes for quick and easy reading. But when we get to Newton, the pace of reading slows down considerably, as we go into the minutiae of, for example, Newton\u2019s various characterizations of the ether or his idiosyncratic conceptions of the deity in relation to the new mechanical world. In the end, however, I got the impression that Newton made no significant contribution to metaphysics. The author himself notes that Newton, in eschewing philosophical speculation, simply inherited the metaphysical prejudices of his time. But if that was the case, why is Newton so important as to make him the culmination of the whole book? I have no idea. On the basis of what was presented, I take it that Newton functioned merely as the last step before the thorough mechanization of our image of the cosmos, and this mainly because once the mathematics was worked out for such an obvious and powerful force as gravity, future scientists simply had no need for Newton\u2019s confused intermingling of science and theology. In other words, because Newton's philosophical contribution was negligible (or confused), his successors needed only to look to his mathematics. I found myself skipping several long quotations of Newton, because I just didn\u2019t see the point in trudging through them. They were that boring.The good news is that the rest of the book is top notch. For anyone that wants to understand why it is that modern philosophy is bogged down by puzzles like the mind-body problem, the primary/secondary-qualities distinction, and the natures of time and space, this book will give you the background, as well as a glimpse of how ancient and medieval philosophy approached these issues. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2881115-ed", "userReview": "As I understand this book Burtt is distressed that the world view that says that the only valid description of reality must ultimately be mathematical. Newton is the central figure in this story, but Burtt starts earlier to give an interesting account of how the Aristotelian qualitative world picture was overthrown. I think that Burtt's argument that we should consider the values at work in the selection of the explanatory models used by scientists has been taken up by many since Burtt. While this may make Burtt seem 'old hat,' his passion, attention to detail and clarity of exposition make this a book still worth reading."}, {"userName": "Brittany Petruzzi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4254456-brittany-petruzzi", "userReview": "If you were moved by Lewis's Discarded Image, Burtt's work will take what you love poetically and bring it down to earth with all the weight it deserves."}, {"userName": "Mahdi Taheri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63572574-mahdi-taheri", "userReview": "\u0686\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0628\u06cc\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0636\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0645\u061f\u0686\u0647 \u062a\u0641\u0627\u0648\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u0628\u06cc\u06cc\u0646 \u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0636\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0627 \u062a\u0641\u0633\u06cc\u0631\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628\u06cc\u060c \u0627\u0633\u0637\u0648\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0648...\u0648\u0642\u062a\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u0645\u062f\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0636\u06cc \u062a\u0628\u06cc\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u06cc\u06a9 \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0645\u060c \u0633\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0621 \u0631\u0627 \u0633\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0645 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0638\u0645\u06cc \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0648 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0632\u06cc\u0628\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f. \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0686\u0647 \u062a\u0636\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u06a9\u0647 \u0648\u0642\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0621 \u0628\u0627 \u0686\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0638\u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0646\u0627\u0631 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0646 \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u062f \u062f\u0627\u062f\u061f\u0622\u06cc\u0627 \u0645\u062f\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0636\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062a\u0628\u06cc\u06cc\u0646 \u0648 \u062a\u0641\u0633\u06cc\u0631 \u06cc\u06a9 \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u0641\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u061f\u0622\u06cc\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0628\u0627 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0647\u0646\u06af \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u0648 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0632\u06cc\u0628\u0627 \u0634\u062f\u0646 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc \u0627\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0621 \u062f\u062e\u06cc\u0644 \u062f\u0631 \u06cc\u06a9 \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u062a\u0628\u06cc\u06cc\u06cc\u0646 \u06cc\u06a9 \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0645 \u0648 \u06cc\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0644\u0630\u062a \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u062f\u0631\u0627\u06a9 \u0646\u0638\u0645 \u0648 \u0632\u06cc\u0628\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u061f\u0622\u06cc\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u0627 \u0628\u0627 \u0645\u062f\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc\u060c \u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u0631\u0627 \u062a\u0648\u0635\u06cc\u0641 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0645 \u06cc\u0627 \u0630\u0647\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0634\u0646\u0627\u062e\u062a \u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u067e\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0632\u062f\u061f***\u0627\u06cc\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0633\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u067e\u0633 \u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u0647 \u0630\u0647\u0646\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f."}, {"userName": "Mihai Barbat", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7825156-mihai-barbat", "userReview": "I have to confess that this was one of the hardest reads of my life so far.

He shows how modern scientific thinking resulted from a change in the view of reality itself ascribing all that is to mathematics. There was also a complete change in the opinion of the human mind.
