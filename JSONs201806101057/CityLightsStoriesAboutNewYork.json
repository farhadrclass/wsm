These stories captivated me. I laughed, cried and read with anticipation....hanging on to every word. His stories of every day people are proof that we do not need sensational journalism. If you know New York, you want to read these stories, and if you don't, you want to read these stories. City Lights is about us all. Here are the stories I read twice: People Cringed, But Twelve Cameras Never BlinkedA Thousand Words?

This is a collection of Dan Barry's \"About New York\" column from the New York Times. He wrote the column from 2003 to 2006. Each of the columns collected here tells a story about a New Yorker. A few are famous, but most are not. They are ordinary New Yorkers, but their stories are nonetheless extraordinary, especially to someone like me who does not live in such a city. The stories of our lives are more fascinating than we think, and this book proves the point with the addition of the magic spice of Gotham. You will meet the umbrella salesmen; you will meet the man with decades of memorabilia stored in an office; you will meet a group of people who gather at a bar to learn Irish stepdancing; you will meet the Mayor of Central Park. All of these characters, and more, wait for your discovery. I enjoyed this entire book, every single page. It nourished me. It captivated me. It made me laugh, and it made me feel pain. It took me out of my little world and into dozens and dozens of other little worlds. You will not regret visiting those worlds. Go out and buy this book wherever you can. You will love it like I love it, especially if you love New York."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3374528-sue", "userReview": "O.K.

So it's good for a quick snack of a read while you're waiting for the coffee to brew.The best pieces are the very few in which Barry is able to stretch out a bit from the usual confines of his column, like the aromatic valedictory to the Fulton Fish Market (p. 61). The section of wrenching 9/11 columns should be taken in small doses. If the Texas Hold 'em piece is a little cheesy (p. 139), still it's good to know what really happened to David Hampton (p. 160), the inspiration for Paul in John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4346459-chris", "userReview": "For anyone who lives or wants to live in NYC, this book really brings out the many hidden stories of people who live there everyday and show how the city affects their life.

Wandering the city as a columnist for The New York Times, Barry visits the denizens of the Fulton Fish Market on the eve of its closing; journeys with an obsessed guide through the secret underground of abandoned subway stops, tunnels, and aqueducts; touches down in bars, hospitals, churches, diners, pools, zoos, memorabilia-stuffed apartments, at births and funerals, the places where people gather, are welcomed, or depart; talks to the ex-athlete who caught the falling baby, the performance artist who works as a mermaid, the octogenarian dancers who find quiet joy in their partnership, and the guy who waves flags over the Cross-Bronx Expressway to wish drivers safe passage.\u00a0 \u00a0Along the way, Barry offers glimpses of New York\u2019s distant and recent past. He explains why the dust-coated wishbones hanging above the bar at McSorley\u2019s Old Ale House belong to the doughboy ghosts of World War I. He recalls a century of grandeur at the Plaza Hotel throught the tales of longtime doormen who will soon be out of a job. He finds that an old man\u2019s quiet death opens back into a past that the man had spent his life denying. And, from the vantage of the Circle Line cruise around Manhattan, he joins tourists as they try to make sense of still-smoldering ruins in Lower Manhattan three weeks after September 11, 2001.Each story in City Lights illuminates New York, as it was and as it is: always changing, always losing and renewing parts of itself, every street corner an opportunity for surprise and revelation.", "title": "City Lights: Stories About New York", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/358068.City_Lights", "average": 3.79, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388332708l/358068.jpg", "reviews": 14, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/205132.Dan_Barry", "name": "Dan Barry"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Writing", "Travel", "Short Stories"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/358068.City_Lights", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6411509-city-lights", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10410420-bottom-of-the-33rd", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156452-the-boys-in-the-bunkhouse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1786680.Pull_Me_Up", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36372923-egypt-may-1908", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39978106-mexico-march-1916"]}
