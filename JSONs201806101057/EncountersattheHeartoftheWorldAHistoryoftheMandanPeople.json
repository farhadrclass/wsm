This is a tribe that was once a large, thriving people that over time was nearly decimated. They battled natural elements, disease and rodents brought by European traders, and battled area tribes, losing 90% or so of their population. Today they are remembered and their descendants have begun to reignite the customs and ceremonies once celebrated by the Mandan people.Very interesting look into a tribe that I had not previously heard (or remembered) of.

The Mandan lived in villages comprised of impressive earth lodges in present day North Dakota along tributaries of the upper Missouri. They are believed to be distantly related to the Sioux tribes or at least the roots of their language suggest so. Tragically the Mandan people were decimated by 1837 (from a population of several thousand to only 100 people) due to drought and an outbreak of smallpox. Their population had been dwindling but the tragic events of 1837 were the coup de grace. Since so few Mandan survived most of the known history is from journals of fur trappers, many explorers such as David Thompson and Lewis and Clark and George Catlin the Indian ethnographer. The Mandan were traders. Although they had their share of conflicts with the Arikara there were no battles with the U.S. military. The region was not even settled by Europeans until many decades after the Mandan population and their tragic decline. I would consider this book to be good scholarship but a dry read. Very few personal stories are told since the emphasis is on the Mandan tribe and to a lesser extent the Arikara and Hidatsa. The author made very little effort to describe the natural landscape or the flora and fauna of the region other than to relay instances of the very cold winters and the notable droughts that occurred. This lack of description is a pet peeve of mine with some history books. When describing a people I want to understand their surrounding environment and how they interacted with it and at a minimum be able to visualize it. I visited the Knife River National Historic Site in 2017. I found the exhibits on the Mandan and Hidatsa at the visitors center and the ranger talks to be more informative than this book. With that said, this book did methodically cover the chronology of the Mandan in this 200 years of recorded history and does contribute to the cannon of Native American history."}, {"userName": "Julia Hendon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15368490-julia-hendon", "userReview": "An impressive feat of research and writing that makes the most of a scattered and diverse set of sources to produce a fascinating history of the Mandan people through the early 1800s. Renowned throughout the Missouri River watershed as traders and farmers, host to Lewis and Clark, and willing to extend cordial relations to all comers as long as they kept the peace, the Mandan were powerful players in the complex social framework of the region. Fenn emphasizes how they saw themselves as at the center of their world, not on a remote frontier as perceived by the French. British, and Americans.

Lewis and Clark met them; it's where Sacajawea and her husband joined the group.Wein's book is a, as she calls it, a mosaic. It is not a linear history, but more of a cultural history.

We know of the Sioux, Apache, Blackfoot and Crow - largely through many \"Westerns\" (movies) - but because the Mandan were largely farmers and traders, and their lives was not \"sexy\", they never make it to the \"big screen\" and hence into our imaginations.That said, Elizabeth Fenn brillantly weaves the remaining threads of Mandan history to tell a story of the great culture that played a Central role in North America's history. I was impressed with their society and the way they bought and sold everything from physical goods to know-how and intellectual property. They were big time capitalists! Fenn's work is clearly worth of the awards it is now receiving. Finally and as a portent to all of us, the Mandans were great, but ultimately overcome by \"Guns, germs and steel\" to quote the title of Jared Diamond's great book. Neigbouring tribes with horses and Western weapons put pressure on their lifestyle, germs (Smallpox, Wooping cough, Cholera and pests (rats) ultimately wiped out 90% of their people, and ultimately the steel of the West caused their anihilation. This book is a tragic story and an important lesson for us all. Our civilization is strong, but unless we can adapt to a changing world include climate challenges and clashes of civilizations, we too will be in trouble."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2225001-tom", "userReview": "Having lived in rural Kansas, I like reading books about the plains Indians.

I never really new what the story of the Mandans was, who they were, how they came to help Lewis and Clark, and how they pretty much disappeared from history within a few decades. This book takes a mountain, well, a large hill, of scattered historical documents and sources and has turned it into clear narrative which tells what happened. Along the way we meet successful and clever Mandans, Europeans a long way from home either for trade (which always made sense to the Mandans) or just to see and document in words and pictures a fascinating and rapidly changing world. How things changed, what caused that change, from shifting trade patterns to measles, whooping cough and smallpox to Norway rats. Advantages of raiding nomadic tribes like the Lakota, who, for example, didn't have to worry about rats because they had no food stores, are shown without a political or moral agenda. For the most part, this is not a story of good versus evil, noble savage versus corrupting whites, but it explains in a convincing way why things changed so quickly after centuries of relative stability. I learned a lot, and highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about this time."}, {"userName": "Roger", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3490044-roger", "userReview": "I gave this book three stars because I did learn some things about the Mandan, but overall I found the book too Eurocentric and a weak attempt at truly understanding the Mandan. It was a book about the Mandan culture through a European lens of diseases and epidemics and needed more of a Native American view. There was too much focus on the author\u2019s background of writing about smallpox epidemics in America and it carried over far too much in this book. Overall the book lacked continuity and needed more focus on the oral history of the Mandan (if it exists). I think that if the reader has a background in Native American cultures this book will add pieces to ones knowledge, but if you don't have this background try another book because you will be frustrated (if you want to understand the Mandan culture.)"}, {"userName": "Maggie Reed", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7435958-maggie-reed", "userReview": "Believe it or not, this is another book that is overfilled with footnotes.

In every category, from spiritual to militarial to cultural, Fenn treated the views and actions with respect and told them unbiasedly. I rarely felt she was inputting her own opinion/view into the matter, and that is how a historical author should write. I want to know what happened, not how you view what happened. After giving some statement, she did not follow it up with a comma and then a short snide or supercillious remark (as many authors are wont to do). This was the facet of Encounters at the Heart of the World that I was most pleased about.Also, I believe Elizabeth did a wonderful job piecing together the history of the Mandan people. It must have been a difficult task as the primary sources are scant, hard to come by, and difficult to interpret. Add to that that when sources do exist from a trader or explorer they have a nasty habit of exaggerating, ommitting, or glossing over many of the details. Thus, it was good work on Fenn's part to vet and piece together the sources.The demise of the Mandan people was in many ways sudden and of course very sad. They had been a mainstay of the upper Missouri region for hundreds of years until they were ultimately conquered by, not by another tribe, not by invading Europeans, they were not even driven out of their homelands by the encroaching spread of America, but they were conquered by disease, namely smallpox. They survived one epidemic of smallpox in 1781, which while it killed many Mandans, they were able to recuperate and regain strength. Over the next 40 years they were beset by other new and foreign diseases such as whooping cough and cholera. But then in the early 1830s they were hit by another wave of smallpox which killed an estimated 7/8ths of the Mandan people. It was a shockingly swift and heartbreaking decimation of the Mandans. In just one year they were reduced to a shadow of their former self, no longer large enough to even occupy their own villages but rather they had to ally themselves with the Arikaras and live in a village with them. On last note, it was fun to read this book as the homeland of the Mandan people is almost literally in my backyard. It was neat to read about places close by and familar to me in North Dakota."}, {"userName": "Sherry", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4958153-sherry", "userReview": "What a loss it is to the world that the Mandan were brought so low.

I am convinced that not many of us know or understand the history of American Indians before European arrival. The story of the Mandans was completely fascinating.... so much I did not know: the Mandans were the corn agriculturists and they traded for most of their meat from the nomad tribes that were the hunters. Serious and planned trading! I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the trading among American Indians! We tend to not use our recognized leadership and business adjectives (trustworthy, determined, creative, influential, charismatic, successful, bullish) for the American Indian...but they could have actually taught the Europeans about trading and the nuances of 'making the deal.' Also, the northern plains Indians regularly traded for items from the southwest...again, the trading was extensive.Of course, I knew about the effects of European diseases, but I did not realize the effect of the rat that came with the steamboats; rats \"obliterated the horticultural bounty that had created stability for the Mandans for centuries.\" The effect of European traders on the established Indian patterns that had existed for centuries was profound...especially the negative aspects of competition it engendered. One effect was vastly more warring among the tribes.Also, the steam engine severely changed life for the Mandans because the traders could easily by-pass their villages and move on to the US established trading forts. And, the ships brought new diseases, cholera and smallpox. Everything was forever changed.This book keeps just the right pace to take the reader through the complete transition from the successful centuries of the Mandan people to domination by the Europeans.

The writing was great. The maps, pictures, and art were a great addition to the history of the Mandan. I wish she would have continued to the 21st Century the way she developed the years prior, however, I am sure that it is difficult after the tribe was nearly wiped off the face of this earth by smallpox virus brought by a riverboat... Elizabeth Fenn did a wonderful job writing this book. There are book marks all over my book that I have enjoyed sharing. The other night as my husband and I were sharing some of our produce with our neighbors and taking a look at the rather large pumpkin we have growing. Our neighbor asked if we were singing to our garden. While I thought this a little off, I responded with, yeah maybe, my husband is always roaming around singing.

Since their homeland was in North Dakota, they were isolated from colonialism longer that many of the plains tribes. The book is very well researched but has gaps, making a reader wish that the sources included fieldnotes from some 19th century ethnographer. I did appreciate the inclusion of the author\u2019s experience of the Mandan territory. The book is also a caution about the process of data interpretation. The author emphasizes the power of women using words such as \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201cdomain.\u201d The data, however, clearly reveal that all the tribe\u2019s manual labor was relegated to women.

Overall it is an excellent book for those who are interested in American Indian history and want to know how one tribe lived and thrived for hundreds of years before white contact decimated their population.

We know of them mostly because Lewis and Clark spent the winter of 1804-1805 with them, but why don't we know more? Who were they really? In this extraordinary book, Elizabeth A. Fenn retrieves their history by piecing together important new discoveries in archaeology, anthropology, geology, climatology, epidemiology, and nutritional science. Her boldly original interpretation of these diverse research findings offers us a new perspective on early American history, a new interpretation of the American past. By 1500, more than twelve thousand Mandans were established on the northern Plains, and their commercial prowess, agricultural skills, and reputation for hospitality became famous. Recent archaeological discoveries show how these Native American people thrived, and then how they collapsed. The damage wrought by imported diseases like smallpox and the havoc caused by the arrival of horses and steamboats were tragic for the Mandans, yet, as Fenn makes clear, their sense of themselves as a people with distinctive traditions endured. A riveting account of Mandan history, landscapes, and people, Fenn's narrative is enriched and enlivened not only by science and research but by her own encounters at the heart of the world.", "title": "Encounters at the Heart of the World: A History of the Mandan People", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237181-encounters-at-the-heart-of-the-world", "average": 3.94, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1421087349l/22237181.jpg", "reviews": 78, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/165537.Elizabeth_A_Fenn", "name": "Elizabeth A.
