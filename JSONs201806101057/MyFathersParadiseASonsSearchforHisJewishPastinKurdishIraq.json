I turned each page feeling slightly elated.The author's father, the subject of the book is a professor in UCLA. He spent his early years on a tiny river island in Kurdistan. This river is mentioned in the Bible as when the Jews went out to Mesopotamia (Iraq) 2,700 years ago. The lingua franca of the Middle East for a thousand years was Aramaic. This is a milennia before the Arabs conquered it and imposed Arabic, a daughter language of Aramaic itself. Aramaic still lives in little pockets of Iraq, although ISIS are doing their best to kill off the last Assryians - the name for Christians there and Mandeans near Mosul. Yona Sabar was the last Jewish boy to be barmitvah in the town of Zahko, Iraqi Kurdistan. The Jews had lived in harmony with the Muslims for more than a millenia, but with the coming of the State of Israel in 1947, the Jews became an extension of Israel to the Muslims and life there became untenable for them. It's not the only place where people known as individuals as well as a community have suddenly become the enemy and subjected to extreme privations and even death. Think of Germany, Poland and Austria before and during the Holocaust. Yet in other countries, such as Albania, the people's political sympathies might lie elsewhere but they zealously protect their Jewish neighbours. Why are some people identifying as the same religion and even same politics so full of love and others so full of hatred towards people they know as individuals so well?As one of the few known speakers of Aramaic in the US, Professor Yona Sabar has been called on by Hollywood on quite a few occasions. He has contributed lines of Aramaic to many films and shows, including George Burns' Oh God!, The X-Files and Curb Your Enthusiasm, although not The Passion of the Christ. Mel Gibson wanted only a Christian to do it. It's really interesting to read of Iraqi Kurdistan in times only recently gone by where people still lived a stye of life more ancient than modern and speak a language that survives, just, from biblical times."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "Finished - wow! What can I say? I guess first of all I want to (((HUG))) GR for existing, for showing me all these MARVELOUS books!!!! OK, about the book. Well, how does the relationship between father and son(author) end up. It ends up right where I wanted it to end up, but you will have to read the book to find this out! It is summed up in the first three sentences on page 322 in the last chapter. Here is one last interesting quote: \"There is a counterpoint to the familiar immigrant story of opportunities won: It is the story, less often told, of cultures lost.\" Yes, cultures are at least watered-down, but if we are aware of this danger maybe we can take steps to help preserve cultures. Furthermore, I believe that we pass on to our children and they to their own children the cultures of our ancestors. Family customs have a tendency to stick, although perhaps not in exactly the original form. This is evident in the author's family, in mine too, and I think in all families where they have emigrated to a new land. I think for many of us we learn to like some things about the new country and also like other things about the country we have left. We pass on these memories to our children. How horrible the world would be if it lacked diversity. What should I read now....... So exciting to start a new book!Through page 272: I MUST add this too! Father and son are at Cambridge taking part at a high level academic conference on the Neo-Aramaic Language. The author MUST be beginning to see the the wonderful character of his father. His father is one of the few of academia who can talk so we all understand, who can make us laugh and feel passion for a subject, who brings all the scientific gibberish back to plain, straight, clear understandable words that ALL understand. Through page 269: What is it like to go back to a place where you grew up? Not many of us live in the same place all our lives, so this is a question that speaks to us all. I have found that the man-made things, yes, they change. Nevertheless you recognize the \"land\". The hills the trees. Somehow the landscape remains and you can reconnect. This is easier in the country rather than in urban areas where everything is practically gone, but teeny bits remain even there. Also, is going back a disappointment? Another topic in this part of the book concerns the author's attempt to reconnect with his father. Quite simply their relationship was not at all good. They were up to that point very different people. When the author had a son himself he started understanding what it is like - \"to be a father\", to love a child irregardless of differences. Maybe it is pure biology, but you just do love your children. All of them, and they too are usually very different from each other! That is where I am now. I do not know where this will end up for these two people, the author and his father.Through page 209: Studying at Yale the author very well captures how it must feel to fall into east coast American ivy league life, having first grown up in a a remote Kurdish village. Even life in bustling Jerusalem has no comparison to life at Yale. I have read lots of immigrant memoirs, but this is one of the best, something I clearly recognized.Through page 176: The family emigrates to Israel. An analysis of the Jewish melting-pot is fascinating: \"Itzhak Ben-Zvi and David Ben-Gurion were sometimes called 'the twins'....Ben-Gurion as Prime Minister, Ben-Zvi as President. Yet, on the question of Israel's Middle Eastern immigrants, they never saw eye to eye. To Ben-Gurion Israel was a melting-pot. ....Ben Zvi was perhaps the only man in Israel with the stripes to challenge the melting-pot theory....For Ben-Zvi, the truth about Jews' common past could best be glimpsed, not through an erasure of differences, but through the light refracted by its many subcultures.\"Or on page 69 and 70 about the great Muslim, Kurdish warrior general Saladin, a champion of jihad born in Tikrit 1138, who repelled the invasion of King Richard the Lionhearted and his Crusaders:\"Yet Saladin is remembered today less for his military cunning than his chivalry. When Richard's horse was killed, Saladin sent two replacements. When Richard fell ill after his victory at Jaffa, Saladin sent a sorbet of fruit and snow to cool his rival's fever. Christian crusaders had slaughtered thousands of Muslim prisoners, but after his victory, Saladin let Christians exit Jerusalem unmolested.\"There is so much here of interest! Religious extremism was rare. Is that the key difference? History moves in cycles, but can't we lessen the waves' peaks and troughs? Through page 69: I love this, so I am sharing a bit with you. Lots of fascinating history dating from 2700 years ago up to what happened to Iraq in WW1 and during WW2. Absolutely fascinating. If history isn't your thing it is still marvelous b/c family life in the isolated mountain village of Zakno constitutes the dominant thread. There are photos of the people and the place and a map - hurray for books with maps, although it is a bit rudimentary. I suck up hearing about how the Jews, Christians and Muslims ENJOYED each other's company:\"Seclusion (in the isolated mountain village) bred fraternity: Muslim, Jew and Christian suffered alike through the region's cruel cycles of flood, famine and Kurdish tribal bloodshed. They prospered alike when the soil yielded bumper crops of wheat, gall nuts and fragrant tobacco. In important ways they were Kurds first and Muslims, Christians and Jews second. Muslims sent Jews bread and milk as gifts after Passover. They ate matzoh, which they called \"holiday bread\" as a delicacy. They sent their Jewish neighbors hot tea during the Sabbath, when Jews were forbidden to light fires. Some Muslims even asked the synagogue to wake them early in the days before Yom Kippur . They viewed early rising on Jewish days of penitence as bringing good luck. And the Jews paid back the respect, forgoing cigarettes , for instance, during the holy month of Ramadan , when Muslims may not smoke.\" Can't we learn from this? In Baghdad, at this time, riots and fighting between Muslims and Jews were violent and constant. Through page 28: I am totally loving this. Although predominantly non-fiction, the uthor is a true story teller. His grandfather is described, when he is first presented to his future bride, who is only 13, as: \"a short man in a shalla u-shappiksa of such brightly colored stripes that Miryam had to resist twin impulses - the first to giggle, the second to flee. The traditional billowy trousers and short sheep's-wool jacket radiated every color of the rainbow. Someone, it seemed, had gotten a little carried away in Mr. Beh Sabagha's dye shop.\" The factual information about the almost dead language Aramaic is fascinating. The book is both about this language and the author's family."}, {"userName": "BlackOxford", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford", "userReview": "The Lost Tribe Loses the PlotA moving story, as so often the case, of Jews dispossessed and exiled. In this instance from the remote region of Kurdish Iraq. There is no question that this story of personal travail is worth telling and worth reading. Among other things, it is a story which provides essential background for the recent rise of Islamic State and its persecution of Kurdish Christians in a re-play of what the Iraqi government did to the Kurdish Jews almost seven decades ago. But Sabar\u2019s main theme isn\u2019t personal, despite his use of his own family on which to paint a picture of what he himself refers to as one of the Lost Tribes of Israel. His primary point is a cultural one. The book is a sort of a conciliatory homage to his father who, removed from the ancestral home of the Kurdistan Jews as a child, is one of a disappearing remnant of this ancient fragment of the Jewish Dispersion directed by the Assyrian empire in the 8th century BCE. His father is, understandably, obsessed by his heritage: \u201cMy father had staked his life on the notion that the past mattered more than anything.\u201d For him, the lost culture of Kurdistani Judaism has an intensely emotional and sentimental import: \u201cThe past felt safe, like a hiding place.\u201d He devotes his life to the documentation of the Neo-Aramaic dialect that was all but lost in the mass emigration. Again, from a personal perspective, this is a not unreasonable response to traumatic dislocation. But the subject of the book isn\u2019t his father, it is the culture in which this arcane dialect persisted and to which his father has devoted his adult life to remembering.What kind of culture was this? Certainly beyond primitive, beyond simple patriarchy. It was a savage, uneducated, feudal culture of subsistence, not one of arts or technology or social graces or even modest civilisation. It was a culture in which not only was a boy-child valued infinitely over a girl (despite a long-term decline in population), but one in which an infant was given away to a nomadic wet-nurse whom no one knew, and who was not pursued when she didn\u2019t return the child as per agreement merely because her father was not so inclined to postpone pressing business engagements. Subsequently he cavalierly risked his sons in his smuggling operations. This was apparently a culture based not on personal, family, tribal, or religious loyalty, but solely on the prospects for trade, both legal and illegal. Its brutality, necessitated in part by the severe physical environment in which it existed, was made an order of magnitude more brutal by the reduction of human relationships to their functional usefulness in maintaining the dominance of males. Think of the poverty of Dickensian London overlaid with the social barbarity of the barrios of Sao Paulo, and the Maoist destruction of family feeling in the Cultural Revolution. This is the world of Kurdish Jews in the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s as portrayed by Sabar - verging itself on tragedy in its very existence. Why then should one be tempted to mourn the passage of such a culture? Sabar\u2019s sentimental quest for his roots as a mode of reconciliation with his father is understandable. But remarkable as is the survival of a remote Jewish enclave for 2700 years, its voluntary assimilation into the modern world, principally the modern world of Israeli Judaism, is hardly a profound tragedy. The life of a Kurdish Jew was no idyll. Viewed as an historical relic, the loss of this remnant of the Assyrian-ordered diaspora and its oral traditions is perhaps of somewhat less significance than the Taliban\u2019s destruction of the Buddha of Bamiyan. Much of the oral tradition could at least be recorded for posterity unlike the ancient statue which is irrecoverable. Viewed as the rescue of a group of impoverished, disadvantaged, illiterate, and hopelessly dying human beings, this same loss can only be viewed as a successful and fortunate work of mercy.There was however one major characteristic of this culture worth saving: its religious tolerance. The isolation of the Kurdish region insulated local Jews, Muslims, Christians and others from the religious ideologies promoted elsewhere - from pan Arab Islam to Zionist Judaism to Evangelical Christianity. Whatever the level of patriarchal brutality existing in any of the Kurdish religious groups, they all had a remarkable degree of mutual respect for tradition and custom according to Sabar. Muslims, for example, routinely carried out sabbath-day tasks forbidden to Jews while Jews refrained from smoking during Ramadan. He describes a sort of equivalent to the Iberian Golden Age of tolerance and civil assistance, without of course the intellectual component. This amicability was destroyed not by Dominican religious agitprop of course but simply by improvement in communications with the ideologically enmeshed world. Having been touched by religious and nationalist propaganda and by the increased political interest in that part of the globe, there was no way inter-religious relations could remain stable after the Second World War.Nevertheless, despite this apparently accidental, and perhaps incidental, religious tolerance, it is difficult to conceive of the conditions in which Kurdish Jews existed to be, as the title suggests, in any way paradise-like. Paradise as a sentimental conceit certainly but not as any ground-truth. No, as a memoir of personal displacement and courageous re-establishment, the book works. As a memorial to a lost culture whose contribution to the world will be missed, it is an inevitable failure."}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina", "userReview": "Read about 4 years ago.

He is also a celebrated linguist who has worked tirelessly to document his language before it dies. This book traces that effort, weaving a colorful tapestry of Jewish life in Iraq, Kurdish life in Israel, and immigrant life in America.Though the portions of the book dealing with Ariel himself were less compelling, the tales of Yona's early life in Kurdistan are hypnotic- I had a difficult time putting this book down. The writing is excellent and the character of Yona breathes throughout the book. The book is never technical about linguistics; the story of Yona's work is presented as I believe he experienced it- a treasure hunt generating excitement with each new clue.Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1066546-michelle", "userReview": "Wow. I really had my expectations exceeded with this one, yet it is hard to describe. Story of Kurdish Jews? (I didn't even know there WERE Kurdish Jews.) Story of the demise of Aramaic? I didn't know anyone still spoke it. Story of a man who immigrated from Kurdish Iraq to Jerusalem to New Haven to LA? Story of a son coming to terms with a father he had never understood? Story of keeping roots in a different land? Maybe all of these things. This haunting part-journalism, part novel, part memoir has elements of all of these. It is a beautiful book, but with a part of it always just out of reach, like the missing aunt the author desperately wanted to find but couldn't. I loved the way the author re-imagined, re-created the past he could not completely pin down through interviews--something I've often toyed with doing myself, although with less exotic material. I cried as he imagined his grandmother, forced to hand over the daughter she could not nurse to a wet-nurse, and then never seeing her again.

Amidst the Middle East conflicts following World War II, Zakho Jews were airlifted to Israel, exposing them to the challenges that the new state of Israel was faced with \u2013 making arrangements to house, feed and deal with the thousands of Jews streaming in from all areas of Europe and the Middle East \u2013 the magnitude of which they had not anticipated. Yona, Ariel Sabar\u2019s father was one such Jew, who eventually made it across to the U.S. and became a preeminent professor at UCLA focused on the studies of language and folklore of the Jews of Kurdistan. Growing up in Los Angeles, Ariel Sabar turned a deaf ear and eye on his heritage and his father, embarrassed and dismissive of his father\u2019s path and struggles. He wanted nothing to do with his immigrant father, nor the \u201cstrange\u201d ways and beliefs his father tried to inculcate in him, preferring to hang out with his hip friends skateboarding, having a good time and ignoring his father whom he began addressing as Yona.

A well-written and absorbing book that not only provides an authentically rich landscape of what it was like for Jews living in Kurdish Iraq, but also takes us into the complex world of a father-son relationship that collides amid the cultural backdrop of old vs. new \u2013 the immigrant vs. first generation."}, {"userName": "K", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k", "userReview": "\"My Father's Paradise\" describes the life and family background of Yona Sabar, the author's father. Yona was born in Zakho, Kurdistan; moved to Israel with his family at the age of twelve; and left for America in his twenties where he became an important scholar of the Neo-Aramaic language. Ariel Sabar's carefully researched book, while focusing essentially on Yona's story, also includes some interesting information about the history of the Kurdish Jews in Zakho and their ignominious reception in Israel in the 1950s, plus a bit of background about the advent of Neo-Aramaic as a recognized language for study. This book was something of a slow starter for me, especially since I wasn't crazy about Ariel's efforts to reconstruct his family's early history in narrative form by fleshing out anecdotes with imagined and sometimes stilted dialogue. Gradually, though, I became fascinated with the story of Yona's rise as the young son of impoverished and uneducated Kurdish parents who never quite learned the ropes in Israel, becoming a Yale graduate and renowned academic. Ariel's journalistic skills are evident in this book -- it is clearly the product of numerous interviews and extensive investigation but the tone remains readable and engaging, never heavy. Ariel also displays admirable honesty as he describes the rebellious attitude he displayed toward his immigrant father as an aggressively American California teen, and how this attitude was eventually transformed to one of closeness and respect.This is a book I probably would not have picked up had it not been for my book club, but I'm glad I did. Like The Man in the White Sharkskin Suit: My Family's Exodus from Old Cairo to the New World, it exposed me to an unfamiliar Jewish community and was a touching story of immigration, trying to reinvent oneself in a new culture, and the complicated relationships within a family. Ariel doesn't shy away from complexity; he shares some choices that his father and his family had to make that might be difficult for 21st century readers to understand, and does so in a sympathetic and respectful way. If the topic interests you at all, I definitely recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1419231-kathy", "userReview": "An excellent, award winning biography from a California raised man trying to better understand his father's journey from Kurdistan to Jerusalem to the United States. Tucked on an island in the river, cut off from the other tribes of Judaism, lived a small but thriving community of Kurdish Jews. Now a part of Iraq, the island town of Zakho found Arabs and Jews living peacefully together, speaking the ancient tongue of Aramaic, until the Jews were forced out of Iraq in the 1950s. Israel absorbed hundreds of thousands of these Sephardic Jews, but they were not welcomed with open arms like the Jews of Europe were. Ariel Sabar's grandparents had a very hard time assimilating, but not so his father Yona, who was just shy of his 13th birthday when they landed in Israel. Yona Sabar thrived in Jerusalem, his fluency in Aramaic proving to be his ticket to a better life, via graduate study at Yale University. Instead of returning to Israel, Yona stayed in the United States, married and moved west to work in the Middle Eastern language department of UCLA. Like his parents, he also had trouble assimilating, finding the United States a very confusing place to live. His children grew up typical California children, embarrassed of their immigrant father.By traveling back to Zakho to learn about his ancestry, Sabar comes to write a very interesting and readable story. It is a story of maturity and coming of age from the author, a story of the history of a little known group of Jews who evolved so differently from the more well known Jewish tribes, a story of the difficulties of immigrating and assimilating, and a story of tolerance and acceptance - from the Arabs who lived so peacefully with the Jews to the parents who accept their Gentile daughter-in-law to the son who embraces his Judaism but rejects customs that many Jewish parents would find unthinkable."}, {"userName": "AnnaMay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1522238-annamay", "userReview": "Fantastic book.

Before reading this, I can't say I knew what a Kurdish Jew was, really, and how one differred from European Jews I'd read about. I didn't have an understanding of Israel/Palestine/Iraq and their relationship with one another, other than knowing it was full of turmoil. Sabar did a great job of interjecting snippets of history (those paragraphs I sometimes had to read a few times to make sure they sunk in) in a great great story of his father's upbringing and immigration to America. I was fascinated, having never been in touch with anyone's story who grew up in an isolated part of the world where Aramaic (\"the language of Christ\") was the main language (and just spoken at that. Zahko, where Sabar's father grew up, was so isolated that many villagers didn't even read. They were born, lived and died in Zahko, having never ventured into the 'outside' world.) Fascinating.

Ieder die dit boek leest hoeft zich volgens mij niet langer te laten overtuigen dat Yona een grote rol heeft ingenomen in het leven van Ariel, als vader. En dat beide mannen ieder op hun manier veel respect voor elkaar en elkaars keuzes hebben. Ariel neemt je mee gedurende het leven van zijn grootouders en zijn vader en hoe anders het leven voor verschillende generaties in andere culturen kan zijn.Het verhaal van het boek Paradijs van mijn vader is echter niet alleen het levensverhaal van Yona en ook niet alleen het verhaal van hoe een man een stervende taal wil doorgeven aan nieuwe generaties. Nee het verhaal omvat veel meer dan dat. Dit verhaal biedt ons inzichten op het leven van Joden in Koerdistan en Irak. Hoe vredelievend de verschillende culturen naast elkaar konden wonen (en hoe wij daar een voorbeeld aan kunnen nemen), hoe ze de verschrikkingen van de tweede wereldoorlog bespaard zijn, maar hoe ze daarna te maken kregen met het verplichte heilige land Isra\u00ebl en het bijna verplichte vertrek uit het vaderland.Erg interessant om dat als Europeaan ook eens mee te krijgen. Heel af en toe door alle verschillende plaatsnamen en landen waar ik niet bekend mee ben lastig te volgen. Het verhaal van Yona betrok me heel erg, af en toe vond ik de onderbrekingen over het lod van de joden dan ook wat jammer. Vooral omdat ik zo graag wilde weten hoe het verhaal verder ging. Ariel heeft dan ook een knap staaltje werk neergezet. Niet alleen omdat dit een mooi verhaal is en mooi verwoord, maar vooral omdat het over zijn vader gaat.

My son gave me this book and I thank him for it and would encourage him to read it. In fact, I plan to send it to him tomorrow so that he can take it on vacation next week.I would divide this book into thirds. The first third is almost like a fairy tale as the author describes what he has learned about his father's family through interviews and historical research. Like the beginning of Hanta Yo, you can't tell what is legend and what is fact. I really enjoyed this part - who knew that there were Jews in Kurdistan speaking Aramaic in the 1950's?The second third describes his father's life, starting in Kurdistan and ending in Los Angeles. Quite an amazing journey! Also very enlightening and interesting.The final third includes the author himself, his father's son, and his total rejection of his past, his total immersion in the LA lifestyle, his marriage to a non Jew (not a terrible thing in and of itself, but...) and, in a rejection of tradition that I can never forgive him for, refusing to circumcise his own firstborn son because his wife, a child psychiatrist, is essentially afraid of it. I really didn't like him. He tried to redeem himself with readers and with his father by engaging in what is ultimately a fruitless quest to find a long lost aunt. It really didn't work.In the end this is an easy to read and interesting story of a family who's story spans three continents and many centuries. The experiences in Israel of this \"oriental\" family uncovers and highlights some of the basic prejudices in Israeli society that probably still persist today.

The neighborhood of the Katomonim was working class and Jewish Kurdish. Not Moroccan, or Yemenite, or Iraqi, but distinctly and undeniably Kurdish. I didn't know at the time that the Kurds were considered to be at the bottom of the Israeli social hierarchy. I didn't then know that the language the older folks were speaking was actually neo-Aramaic, the surviving remnant of the language of the ancient land of Israel, found in Books of Ezra and Daniel and in the Talmud. I thought of them only as ordinary working class Mizrahim, \"Sephardic\" Jews from Arab lands.We young Americans in Katamon Vav, for our part, were real oddities. We were from the golden medina (how do you say \"golden land\" in Kurdish Aramaic?), but poor, living on student stipends and minimum wage jobs. They must have wondered what the hell we were doing in their world. In some global sense I was on the top of the heap - I had a college degree and an American passport! But in another sense, with my broken Hebrew and lack of money, living on white cheese, lehem chai, lemon juice syrup and cucumbers with three other bachelors, I was below these Israeli Kurdish natives in social status. I may have had a fine American life waiting for me if I left, but I was a miserably incompetent Israeli in their world. We did not interact much with our Kurdish neighbors. They didn't invite us into their lives. I was curious about them, but busy with my studies at Hebrew University. It was just a rental situation in a poor neighborhood. Ariel Sabar's \"My Father's Paradise: A Son's Search for his Jewish Past in Kurdish Iraq\" puts everything I experienced in Kurdish Jerusalem in context. Through his eyes I understand better what Iraqi Kurdistan once was, what my neighbors must have experienced in making the vast cultural jump to Israel, and who they were in a deep sense. Reading Sabar a new affection for them replaces what was largely an experience of curiosity mixed with non-communication and misunderstandings, mostly of the ordinary landlord-tenant kind, but exacerbated by cross-cultural miscues. Sabar's narrative is a two level story, personal and historical. At the personal level, it is the story of his own struggles in America with his immigrant father, a double immigrant, from both Kurdistan and the Jerusalem Katamonim where I had lived. By the time of Sabar's birth in 1971, Sabar's father had left the Katamonim and Israel to become a world renowned academic scholar of neo-Aramaic. He was ensconced at UCLA and Sabar would be raised in Los Angeles of the 1970s and 1980s. Their relationship was difficult and the book is the story of Sabar's effort as an American to understand his father, so culturally alien in manner and perspective. It is an old immigrant story, a father from the old country and a son in the new who do not understand each other, and it is beautifully told in a modern manifestation here.But beyond the personal the book is also an historical narrative of the entire Kurdish immigration and settlement, describing the deep history of the Jewish settlement in Kurdistan, beginning with the original Babylonia exile in 500 BCE, and then moving forward across hundreds of years of little recorded history in a mountainous back country, using fragments of historical texts and family history to tell the story of the entire Kurdish Jewish situation, culminating in the mass exodus of the Kurdish Jewish community to Israel in 1951. Anyone who has lived in Israel or has relatives (like I do) who were immigrants from the lands of e'dote ha'mizrach (the eastern communities) is familiar with the 1950s ma'aborot (transit camps) and the stories of the struggle, bigotry and discrimination that Middle Eastern Jews experienced at the hands of the Ashkenazi Israeli establishment of the era. Sabar's narrative brings that experience to life. As his family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) and friends make clear, the dislocation and the poverty were profound, and the 1950s era bigotry was cutting. When Sabar's father received a scholarship at Yale in 1965 it is no surprise that he leaped for the life it promised as an American academic. His siblings however remained in Israel and their stories, explored here in some detail, are more typical of Kurdish immigrants to Israel like my former neighbors in the Katamonim. But beyond my year in Katamon Vav, the personal parallels between my own life and Sabar's make this book feel intimately familiar to me. He and I share Los Angeles. Ariel Sabar grew up in Los Angeles in the 1970s and 1980s. I was some ten years older and grew up there in the 1970s. His father was a professor, the son of immigrant parents, who found freedom and professional renown in faraway Los Angeles. My father was also a professor, the son of immigrants (Russian Jews living in the Bronx, New York 1930s) who found freedom and professional renown in faraway Los Angeles. Ariel Sabar struggled more overtly with his father than I did with mine, but in the end we both developed a sense that the thing we were missing in the cultural break created by our parents' movement to the sun-baked sterility of Southern California had something to do with the obscure past our parents left behind. Sabar's need to discover a past seems to have its roots in the dystopian eternal now of West Los Angeles. There is a special ahistorical madness that develops in that California sun. It got to me, and it got to him. In a world without a past, sometimes you have to write one yourself.Twenty seven years have passed since I lived in Katamon in 1985, a full generation. That's as much time as had already passed since the Kurds had first come to Israel and moved into the Katamon neighborhood when I was there in the mid-1980s. When I returned in 2009 the neighborhood looked perhaps slightly improved in the intervening quarter century. I thought I recognized the house I lived in. (See GoogleMaps link below.) I didn't knock. I couldn't remember the landlord's name. You can't go back. At least, you can't go back in any simple sense. Sabar does a lot of going back in his book, and discovers what remains and what has been washed away forever. Ariel Sabar's story of searching for his father's past, and thus his own present, is marvelous as journalism, memoir, family history, Jewish and Middle Eastern history, and a beautiful exploration of an uneasy relationship between a father and a son. He does not wrap it up for us in a bow, or pretend that all the differences and breaks are reconciled. He saves the biggest disappointment for the end, and discovers the people who can never be reunited and the breaks that can never be repaired. But he does show us how it is possible to come to terms with the personal and cultural breaks that emerge as people grow into new cultural situations and migrate apart. It's a broken world he seems to say, but it can still all hang together in a new way if we weave the right web of words. The web of words will bind us together and a livable coherence will emerge, and yet there will be story lines whose conclusions will be forever lost and questions that can never be resolved. ---Postscript: I lived in one of these low buildings at 25 Antigonus (see GoogleMaps link below, in Katamon Vav (Katamon Six), Jerusalem, Israel, a Kurdish neighborhood.

It is an excavation into a corner of civilization itself.Ariel Sabar looks for his own roots by searching for his father\u2019s, and his search takes him back nearly three millennia.After a short introduction of himself as a teen-age L.A. hellion, he novelizes his family\u2019s Kurdish past, not in the manner of Khaled Hosseini in The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns but more like Michener, except the characters are his own forebears. He brings alive in historical context his father\u2019s native Iraqui Kurdish village of Zakhor, a ways north from Mosul (we all know that name now, don\u2019t we?) But Zakhor isn\u2019t just any little Iraqui village.Here is some of the history: When the ancient (700 b.c,) Assyrians scattered the Jews hither and yon, two main groups ended up in Assyria (now Iraq, more or less). The northern Judeans (or the southern, I forget which) ended up around Baghdad, where they wrote wonderful poetry (\u201cBy the waters of Babylon . . .How can we sing the Lord\u2019s song in a strange land?\u201d the singer in the famous Psalm 137 writes.). They built cities and businesses, wrote the Talmud, and generally maintained a peaceful, sometimes loving and friendly, coexistence with their their Arab neighbors. The southern Judeans (or northern, see above) ended up in said village of Zakhor. They, too, integrated well with their neighbors, but they were humble tradespeople, generally illiterate. Neither group knew of the other\u2019s existence except by rumor. In fact, some believe the Jews of Zakhor are truly the lost tribe of Israel. They did, however, in their isolation, do us all an enormous, albeit inadvertent, favor. They kept alive the Aramaic language. The language of Jesus. The language that was the lingua franca of the middle east for centuries. For millenia, through all the conquests of Alexander, Rome, and Greece.All this fell apart during the 1940\u2019s when the UN established Israel and the presence and very existence of Jews suddenly became abhorrent to every government in the Arab world (though not by any means to all Arabs, who mourned the loss of their neighbors, who had been truly family.) So the Jewish-Arab love affair that had lasted for twenty-seven hundred years, years during which they sang each other\u2019s songs, danced at each other\u2019s weddings, shared far more of themselves than they held back, a love affair that survived all those conquests, the rise of Islam and four hundred years of the Ottoman Empire, the affair that lasted so long you would have thought it would never end went through that sudden and incredibly violent divorce. And you might say that we children of the divorce live with its pain today.On the other hand, it was that divorce that brought Ariel Sabar\u2019s father first to Israel, then to America. It\u2019s quite a story. In the Israeli pecking order, Kurds were (are?) at the very bottom. Even lower than the Morrocans. As Sabar puts it, Israel was a European solution to a European problem, and there was little thought or consideration given originally to those who still lived in the Holy Land. These unruly, Arabized, peasants threatened the grand vision of European zealot Zionists like David Ben-Gurion and Chaim Weizmann, and they took them in only when they had no other choice. And they did not treat them well.So, for Sabar\u2019s father, Yona, to claw his way from a slum-dwelling despised minority through Hebrew University to a Yale scholarship to a distinguished UCLA professorship is equivalent, say, to an east L.A. cholo with illiterate, Spanish-speaking immigrant parents, wrangling his way to a position on the Harvard faculty.Then comes the standard memoir part, the author\u2019s own story. That of an L.A. 60\u2019s American kid wanting desperately to fit in and be popular. He\u2019s held back, he believes, by a nerdy father with a funny accent (His mother is American.) He defies, disrespects, denies, and rejects his father at every turn. All the while, his father\u2019s life work--analyzing and preserving his rapidly disappearing boyhood Aramaic language, is gaining him global renown. But what does the kid care about that? He\u2019s all grown up, a hotshot reporter on an eastern newspaper with a shiksa wife.Then a door opens. A Hollywood door. X-Files wants to raise Lazarus in one episode, and a producer calls his father for some genuine Aramaic to accomplish the deed. Ariel\u2019s reporter\u2019s instinct tells him there\u2019s a story here, so he calls his father, and their relationship takes off from there. Their collaboration creates investigations, searches, interviews, trips into dangerous territory (Would you have chanced being a Jewish-American journalist on the streets of Mosul in 2005?) So amid the moving father-son-and-the-rest-of-the-family drama, there\u2019s lots of adventure. Don\u2019t depend on my summary, though. It\u2019s like looking at a street map of Paris compared to strolling the Left Bank. You\u2019ve got to be inside the book to get the experience.What I took away from this compelling and expertly written work more than anything else if this: For those of us who have lived through the last sixty or seventy years of Arab-Israeli strife, who like to compare Islam-Christian atrocity stories dating back to the seventh century, who sometimes think that it has always been thus and always thus shall be, remember that there was once a sort of middle eastern Camelot, and it prospered, and it lasted much longer than the contemporary blood feuds we\u2019re wringing our hands over. Al Quaeda and Hamas and Hezbollah and Saddam Hussein and Benjamin Netenyahu will last only a blink compared to the enduring wonders of Zakhor and the Assyrian Jews and the brotherhood they shared with their Arab neighbors. That\u2019s the past we should hearken to, and My Father\u2019s Paradise makes you think it just might be possible."}, {"userName": "Victoria Raun", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26290479-victoria-raun", "userReview": "Sabar writes an eloquent history of his family and of the Kurdish Jews of Zakho, Iraq.

The book shifts from the social and political aspects of the culture and it's struggles to maintain the legacy of it's heritage and language to the tale of how his father, Yona, and his family lived in Zakho, a small town in Kurdish Iraq, and their eventual departure. But instead of being a quaint saga of a family's lineage, it is rather a homage to his father and the accomplishments he has made in the preservation of a people that are fast disappearing. I learned to love Yona Sabar, just as his son and students did. He humbled and awed me with the diligence that kept his people's language alive.I came to this book with little familiarity of the region and it's people, and felt that the author excelled at highlighting the reasons and ramifications of the Jews eventual emigration to Israel from Iraq, and the adversity that they faced in their new home. It was distressing to realize that this modest group of people were hated and marginalized in a place that they hoped would be a haven and sanctuary for them. Against all the odds, Yona Sabar achieved what most had never dreamed of: success and notoriety as a professor, author, and language consultant. Though, sadly, he could not accomplish this in Israel. After moving to America, his success came with struggles to assimilate with its culture. These passages were deeply affecting and stirring. I felt heavyhearted reading about his loneliness and isolation in a new country, so alien from his own.The author's relationship with his father was portrayed with unflinching honesty and true feeling. It seemed it was not always easy to have a father who was so different from everyone else. But the very things that initially created distance between father and son later came to be the things that brought them together. It was a poignant reversal that closed the generational gap. As the author searched for meaning and understanding in his father's past, his father became the touchstone of his ethnic identity.This book ran the gamut of emotions: there was pleasure in the tale of the aged storyteller of the village, who used his stories to enlighten his people as well as attain his own ends; there was sorrow in the story of a missing relative who was lost in the sands of time; and there was anger in the subjugation of a noble people who struggled with their new circumstances. Though there was much sadness, I ultimately found this story as one of hope.Another thing I liked about this book was the conversational style in which it was written. The information was not dumbed down for the audience, and neither was it too complicated to be accessible. I felt as though I got to know the author as well as the subject through his use of a welcoming style of journalistic approach. The book includes black and white photographs as well as facsimiles of noteworthy documents. I found this extra detail very inviting. It was gratifying to be able to see some of the people who I was getting to know.This was a very pleasing book. I learned a tremendous amount about a culture that was previously unknown to me, and the people inhabiting the pages were so detailed and their motivations were so amply described that I felt as though I could have been right there with them, comforting them when they cried, and sharing the sound of their laughter. Yona I found to be particularly enjoyable. He was funny and self-depreciating, as well as being intelligent and kind. His quest to save the Aramaic language was deeply impressive. I admired the skillful handling of these subjects by the author, and would definitely recommend this book to others."}, {"userName": "Trupti Dorge", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1656694-trupti-dorge", "userReview": "I read the first 100 pages of this book and then I misplaced it. I was very disappointed as I was really into it. And then after some time I found it again. It had slipped underneath my bed from the tiny space between the bed and the wall. When I started reading it again from the point I left, I couldn\u2019t follow the story, so I thought I would skim the first 100 pages again. But I ended reading them instead of skimming. And I\u2019m so glad I did. I understood the book so much better because of that. For someone like me who didn\u2019t know anything about Kurdish Jews or Zakho, I\u2019m actually glad I misplaced it. This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have to re-read the beginning too. I know that\u2019s just me. That\u2019s just to say how engrossing the book was even the second time around.In a small and dusty village called Zakho at the border of Iraq, nestled between the mountains and almost secluded from the rest of Iraq, a boy called Yona Sabagha, Ariel Sabar\u2019s father, was born. Yona was the son of Rahmain and grandson of Ephraim, who was a respected dyer and was known to talk to angels. Yona spent his first 11 years in Zakho, a place where where Muslims and Jews lived in Harmony. But somewhere around the time of the Second World War, things began to change. The Arab Islamic movement took hold in Baghdad and the rest of Iraq, which resulted in conflicts between the Jews and Muslims. Majority of the Jews from the Arab World fled to Israel. Along with the millions of Jews, Yona\u2019s family too had to go.In Israel, Yona struggled with life and getting a job and studying. What really amazed me was the courage and conviction of Yona and his friends to become something, to pull themselves and families above the poverty line. When Yona was granted scholarship in the States, he decided to take it. There he met his future wife. So in a way his son Ariel did not experience or know what it was like to be a Kurdish Jew. He was an American through and through. Yona could never really accept the American culture, nor could he go back to his past.S o he was in a way strange to his son.After many years Ariel decides to go back to Zakho with his father in the hopes of getting to know him better and also to close the rift that had divided them for so many years.I absolutely LOVED this book. It reads like fiction where he describes his father and his life and like non-fiction where he writes about the Kurdish Jews and the history of Aramaic. But no where does it get boring or over-bearing. The descriptions of Zakho, what it was like then and now, were mesmerizing. It was like discovering a whole new world.The journey of a son to understand his father, his past and his own roots was beautiful, heartbreaking, captivating and hopeful. This book felt like a tribute to his father and the Jews from Zakho who are relatively unknown to the world. Author Ariel Sabar has documented history in the most beautiful way possible.Very highly recommended.

In some respects, the author seeking to uncover truth about the family member is a surrogate for the reader, who embarks on his own voyage of discovery by reading the book. The intertwining of a family story and a larger historical and cultural story can maks for rich reading. My Father\u2019s Paradise is such a book. Yona ben Sabagha grows up in Zacho, a town in far northern Iraq. He is a member of the Kurdish Jewish community, which dates back hundreds or even thousands of years. While the Kurdish Jews, have a rich oral linguistic tradition of folk tales and life ways in their version of the ancient Aramaic language, they never developed a written language. Unlike other Jewish communities, the Kurdish Jews, isolated in their mountain region, retained the characteristics of an earlier time of \u201cprimitive\u201d cultural traditions, and lived in total harmony with their Moslem and Christian neighbors. At the end of the 1940\u2019s, the Iraqi government and much of the populace turned against the Jewish community, and expelled them from the country. Twelve year old Yona, together with others in his family, had to leave practically everything behind and emigrate to Israel. Although the Israeli government was committed to ingathering of the exiles, it had little to offer them when they arrive. In Israel, the Kurdish Jews were seen as the lowest of the low, the butt of ridicule. Yona, who tried to assimilate by changing his name to Yona Sabar (literally, Yona the Sabra) eventually gained an education and became a university student. Against the tide of assimilation, he developed fascination with the culture his family left behind and wents on to become the leading authority on the Kurdish Jewish language and the author of a dictionary that preserves its meanings. Yona\u2019s son Ariel Sabar grew up in Los Angeles where his father, a celebrated teacher but also someone who never adjusted to American mores, seemed to him to be out of place in the contemporary life of the family\u2019s community. Belatedly, Ariel comes to appreciate his father and the traditions that his father has spent his life preserving in memory and through scholarly study. This book, which is as much a non-fiction novel (with some parts that are as much imagined as reported) as a memoir or biography, makes for absorbing reading.

The story begins when Yona is a Jewish boy growing up in Kurdish Iraq in the early twentieth century, a time when the Muslims, Christians, and Jews of the region lived in relative harmony. When religious tensions began to escalate in the Middle East mid-century, teenaged Yona and his family emigrate to Israel, thus forfeiting their Iraqi citizenship. Yona eventually moves to the United States and becomes a leading scholar at UCLA in Aramaic, his native language. I was really fascinated by the part of the book that took place in Israel. I had never thought much about the difficulties that were encountered as the country\u2019s population grew so quickly with immigrants from so many different regions and nationalities. Yona and his family struggled to make their way in a society dominated by European Jews, facing the stereotypes and prejudices against Kurdish Jews and Middle Eastern Jews in general. I was very impressed by the Ariel\u2019s personal journey and the way his relationship with his father grew. He spent his teenage years and young adulthood embarrassed by his father, trying to distance himself from his father\u2019s heritage and become a full fledged American. When he has a son of his own, he begins to realize the importance of family legacy, and starts a journey to understand his father\u2019s past. Ariel and Yona travel to Israel and Iraq together to gain insight into the past. The book was very well balanced between history, politics, and personal narrative. I learned a lot about the history and politics of the time and region. The book is by no means overly political or religious, but there are definitely valuable insights into both. The personal story was very well-written and heartfelt. The author did an excellent job depicting himself, his father and their relationship. I was in tears by the end of the book seeing how their relationship progressed. I debated between four and five stars. I would definitely recommend this book."}], "description": "In a remote corner of the world, forgotten for nearly three thousand years, lived an enclave of Kurdish Jews so isolated that they still spoke Aramaic, the language of Jesus.
