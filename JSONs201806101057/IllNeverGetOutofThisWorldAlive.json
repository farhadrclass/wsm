The punch line is Steve Earle\u2019s debut novel which is populated by the above group of misfits who as a group do go into a bar at one point in the story.The title comes from the last Hank Williams song to be released prior to his death on January 1, 1953. He was twenty-nine years old when he died in the backseat of his Cadillac on the way to a concert date. Written by Williams and Fred Rose, the song was meant to be humorous and ironic, but the irony took on a different tone after the singer\u2019s death. It quickly soared to the top of the country charts.Apparently a doctor had been summoned to give Williams an injection of vitamins mixed with morphine to help him cope with the chronic back pain caused by the spina bifida he was born with, which caused him great misery throughout his lifetime and had caused him to become addicted. The drug mixed with the alcohol that he was consuming at the time has been given as the explanation for his death.In an interview Steve Earle stated that he always believed that a doctor was travelling with Williams and that it was he who administered the injection, but who then skedaddled when it became apparent that Williams wasn\u2019t going to survive. It is that imagined doctor, Doc Ebersole, who is the central character in the novel. Due to his morphine addiction, he has lost his license to practice, but practice he does in the Yellow Rose Resort Home in San Antonio\u2019s red light district where he finally landed after leaving Louisiana. Among his patients are the wounded and maimed and uninsured, who avoid hospital emergency rooms because they would be asked questions that they do not want to answer. But those are not the patients who provide him with most of the income that he needs to feed his drug habit. Because the year is 1963, and because it is ten years before Roe v. Wade, the doctor\u2019s room in the Yellow Rose is not only an emergency room, it is also an abortion clinic. The doctor justifies his performance of the illegal procedures on the basis that the women he serves are poor. The rich, he says, can always get an illegal, but safe, abortion, but the poor can\u2019t. At least, he rationalizes, when they come to him their lives will not be unduly jeopardized.Oh, did I mention that he is haunted by Hank Williams\u2019 ghost? He and the ghost are able to engage in conversation, but their relationship is an uneasy one. Hank often asks Doc for morphine to ease his back pain and Doc refuses on the ground that it is impossible to inject a ghost and besides he says that Hank is \u201cas pitiful an excuse for a ghost as he was as a human being.\u201dDoc\u2019s life is changed after performing an abortion on Graciela, an illegal Mexican immigrant, who is only a teenager. She not only has a positive transformative effect on Doc, but by some mysterious and magical way she also changes the lives of others with whom she comes into contact.I don\u2019t want to venture into spoiler territory, so that\u2019s enough about the plot. But I will add that the grim story is lightened somewhat by moments of humor \u2013 dark humor, to be sure \u2013 but humor nevertheless.A mixture of reality and mysticism \u2013 what has come to be called magical-realism \u2013 doesn\u2019t always work for me. There is a fragile balance between the two elements that has to be maintained but I believe Earle successfully maintained that balance. The critic for the LA Times put it best: \u201cEarle is pointing out that reality can merge with myth in the service of a larger truth.\u201dThe realism element in Earle\u2019s story stems from the fact that he grew up near San Antonio and knows the town. He also knows the people who populate his novel since he was arrested for possession of heroin in 1993 and cocaine and the illegal possession of firearms a year later. He was sentenced to a year in jail but was released after serving two months. He recently separated from his seventh wife, actually his sixth, since he was married twice to one wife.The magical element, on the other hand, is the product of a tremendously creative brain. He is not only a singer and song writer, but he is also a poet and a playwright and an actor, and has published a short story collection that received good notices. And now he has written a novel that is being developed as a film. And he is a musician who plays the guitar, mandolin, banjo, harmonica, and bouzouki. If you don\u2019t recognize that last instrument by that name perhaps you know it by one of its two other names --trichordo or tetrachordo \u2013 or perhaps not."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9104103-ian", "userReview": "Steve Earle is a problem for many a blue collar Republican. He started out making music by looking and sounding a lot like them, his songs about making a better life, patriotism, love won and lost, and God, resonated and they were hooked. Mostly they still are, only along the way Earle's experiences of heroin addiction and prison altered his perspective as his life was touched by injustice and the oppressed. He couldn't ignore it.His brilliant first book, Doghouse Roses, comprised of short stories mostly developed from his song writing, themes familiar to fans and to those who like his music yet can't stomach his forthright politics and championing of the 99%.His detractors need have no fear of his first novel as he has avoided preaching and concentrated on pure storytelling, indeed he has very skillfully, and non judgmentally, navigated his way through both sides of a number of debates not least those concerning abortion.In I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive, using his love of common man with all of his flaws, and experiences of a side of life most readers will never have to come close to experiencing, Earle has crafted a solid story adorned with intricate details.Rather like a virtuoso musician however it is the notes, or details, which Earle leaves out which are often most important.Set in early 60s Dallas, the three principal characters are the protagonist Doc, his devotee the curandera Graciela, and Manny his dealer.Doc is a struck off medic forced to live off the only skill he knows as a back street abortionist and self taught surgeon to no goods wishing to avoid hospitals at all costs.He succombs to a life of drug dependency and requires daily fixing of increasingly more dangerous doses to function and work to live and feed the habit.Doc is terrorised by the vision of Hank Williams who we are led to assume perished at the hands of Doc although it is also likely the end was nigh before Doc administered a fatal dose of morphine.It is my reading that rather than a ghost visitation the appearance of ol'e Hank is a trippy hallucination driven by Doc's troubled conscience and therefore the vision takes on a sinister personality.Earle does assume in the reader a certain prior knowledge of Hank Williams and his unfortunate end. and the portrayal of Williams may be misinterpreted but I'm sure Steve was aware of that possibility when overlaying Doc's guilt onto his nightmare vision of Hank.It is when the more more wordly yet mysterious young Mexican immigrant Graciela appears for an abortion, literally dumped with Doc by her loathsome boyfriend, that life begins to turn around, slowly and painfully, for Doc, and for a cast of characters surrounding him. The consequent push and pull with Hank is redolent of the effects of cold turkey. Graciela is the miraculous yang, Hank the demonic yin.There are many turns and sub plots, and a cast of characters which include a black transvestite prostitute and a sinister Catholic priest, before we find out if yang defeats yin for Doc, and if he finally makes peace with his conscience in the form of Hank.The journey to redemption for Doc, Graciela and Manny is beautifully told by Earle with great knowledge of the extraordinary time and place, and well researched input of Mexican healing and spiritual traditions.A cameo of the Kennedy's visit to Dallas seems an unecessary sideshow but I can only assume Earle intended its inclusion as a place and time setter to aid the imagination. It adds nothing I could ascertain of substance to the plot other than suggestions of fascination with Jackie and a subliminal connection to Graciela's prescience, and a quite bizzare and a scarcely believable daytrip for the principal characters. It is a very minor criticism of a wonderful novel which deserves to be read widely and hopefully marks the beginning of a regular outlet for this talented writer to express his visions beyond what is possible in a four minute song.There's no hard core socialism here only balance and heart felt experience from this hard core troubadour, and a finale of surprising sensitivity and extraordinary vision."}, {"userName": "Lisa Reads & Reviews", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5395843-lisa-reads-reviews", "userReview": "Grammy award winner, singer/songwriter Steve Earle named this novel after his 14th studio album released in 2011. He has acted in roles on television and in movies. While I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive is his first novel, Earle has also written a play and a book of short stories. To be honest, I hadn't heard of him before reading his novel, so my opinion is only swayed by having read about him on Wiki, and liking his anti-war, anti-death penalty, etc views. The man has led a colorful life, to say the least. As Earle is a recovering heroin addict, I give him credit for the consistency and range of his artist endeavors. As for the novel, Earle achieved the goal of causing this reader to want to know what was going to happen, which is not a trivial accomplishment. It is not a story with soaring prose or deep insight. It is not well written. In fact, I believe an unknown author would never had sold it to a publisher--at least until it had been further developed and edited.The story itself reminded me of Mister God, This Is Anna. When I first read Flynn's story, I was deeply touched, amazed, and tearful at the end. It had been presented as non-fiction, followed by controversy and exposure as being pure fabrication. I read it again, a couple years ago, and regretted the loss of magic. In any case, Earle's novel reminded me of Flynn's but Flynn's was better. Both novels revolve around a miraculous young girl. Flynn's Anna is beyond religion. To her, church was like going to a park with \"Keep off the grass\" signs everywhere. Anna was wise, insightful, and viewed always from the main character's POV. This allowed her to be mysterious. Earle jumps from one POV to another, including brief glimpses inside Graciela (who turns out to be a Mexican shaman with a sprinkling influence of Catholicism). For me, this POV jumping reduced the impact of the characters. This was but one example of the problems I saw with Earle's novel. But then, I'm a struggling, self-published novelist and Mr. Earle is a successful entertainer. You might enjoy the novel, especially if you are a Steve Earle fan.

Steve Earle is a songwriter, so I expected the book to be deep and inspirational.What it really was like: such a disappointment. Even though some parts of the books were inspirational, the story itself was really lightweight and not at all what I've\u00b4 expected.

He gets by providing abortions and other medical services to skid row characters who for various reasons can't or won't go to a hospital.

Maybe it wasn't the best or most delicious in all the lunchroom, but it was made with love and frugal thoughtfulness, neatly wrapped in a brown paper bag. While Earle's writing is in no way groundbreaking or wholly original in its style and contents, it's pure, it's crisp, it's clean and it's from the heart. I was amazed by the depth and redemption of his characters, the lush moral contrast of the churches and back alleys of South Prisa Strip and the fusion of history and the otherworldly. I would have, however, liked to see Earle dig deeper into the political undertones of his novel (specifically the conflict of abortion), being that his treatment of them was fairly brusque and watered-down. I'm sure he was afraid that by getting more political, he would compromise the magical-realistic element of the story, however I think that it would have made the book much more relevant, especially considering the upcoming American presidential elections.

Doc Ebersole is a down on his luck physician. Having been one of Hank William's last friends and physicians he has watched his life fall into an extreme state of disrepair. Strung out on heroin and having lost his medical license he spends his days shooting up and his nights performing illegal abortions in the most desolate street in San Antonio. All the while he is haunted by the ghost of Hank. Until Graciela comes along. First a patient, it soon becomes obvious that there is more to this girl than meets the eye.Earle has written a masterful reflection on loneliness, addiction, despair and redemption. With the hand of a seasoned writer he weaves in abortion, liberation theology, Mexican theological mysticism and an indictment on the moral bankruptcies of the priesthood.This is not an easy tale. It is grit and dirt and despair. But oh, is it beautifully written and chock full of characters worth remembering.

That would be this one. The characters are almost representations of a kind of person instead of an actual 3D character, which gives the story an almost fable-like feel. Considering the themes, this may have been conscious and appropriate. I was a little iffy on the motivations of some of the characters, as well as some of the dialogue, but Earle really spun an enjoyable yarn into what I would see as ideal summer reading.

This was an instant cover buy for me and I didn't expect much, however, it pleasantly surprised me and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this! The premise is one of my favourite time periods of US history - 1960s with the Kennedys, that won me over! I wouldn't say that the plot was unusual or extraordinary but Earle definitely had me turning pages, wanting to find on what was was going to happen, which is not a trivial accomplishment. What made me really love this book was the diverse set of characters, mostly Mexican, which was refreshing to read because I don't remember the last time I read a novel with a character who was Mexican or had South American roots. However, the fact that Doc, the protagonist, was still white kind of bugged me because if you've set the entire novel with characters who are diverse and a setting/premise which is unusual too, might as well have a different protagonist. The portrayal of all the characters was very natural - their thoughts, how they talked was very realistic but at the same time, most of how they behaved kind of reinforced certain stereotypes about their racial/ethnic background which was a bit problematic. All in all, the characters had a very natural, real, feel to them and I could easily relate to them. The writing wasn't perfect, but wasn't something that would made me regret reading this book; there were even instances when it was amazing. I wouldn't call this a serious novel by any means but I really liked that without losing the feel of fiction, this book addressed real-life issues such as the taboo associated with abortion because of religion, racial inequality within religious organisations like churches, drug addiction and lives of sex workers, with ease like a non-fiction would do. The ending wasn't a shock because I already anticipated it, however the way it played out was quite different then what I thought it would be, so I was a bit taken aback by it.

Es fasst die Stimmung des Buches, das offensichtlich nach diesem Lied benannt wurde, perfekt zusammen. Es ist ruhig, schon fast monoton und dennoch dramatisch, trostlos, mit einem Funken Ironie, sowie Hoffnung. Doc ist ein sehr passiver und Protagonist. Man erf\u00e4hrt wenig \u00fcber seine Gef\u00fchlswelt und noch weniger \u00fcber die der anderen Charaktere. Der Erz\u00e4hler beschreibt das meiste zwar aus Docs Sicht, doch die Charaktere sind bis zum Ende ein R\u00e4tsel. Aber darum geht es auch gar nicht. Es geht vielmehr um die Geschehnisse und die Handlungen der Personen, um die Beweggr\u00fcnde.Mich hat von Anfang an etwas in seinen Bann gezogen. War es die Atmosph\u00e4re? Oder die Neugier, wohin mich das Buch f\u00fchren will? Vielleicht war es auch der sehr sch\u00f6ne Schreibstil, ich kann es nicht genau sagen. Im Grunde fehlt dem Buch ein roter Faden und teilweise wei\u00df man gar nicht, was man denken soll. Existiert Hank, der Geist, der Doc heimsucht? Oder ist er eine Einbildung, w\u00e4hrend dieser von Drogen berauscht ist? Was ist mit Graciela? Bilden sich alle nur ein, dass sie Wunder bei Verletzten vollbringen kann, oder ist sie wirklich eine \u201evon Gott gesandte\u201c bzw. eine Hexe? Diese Fragen kl\u00e4ren sich nicht auf. Ich bin mir sicher, dass man diese Dinge in einem \u00fcbertragenen Sinn betrachten sollte, doch ich bin immer noch unschl\u00fcssig, was Steve Earle vermittel wollte. Vielleicht, dass Menschen sich nicht in gut und b\u00f6se einteilen lassen. Dass niemand, der schlechte Dinge getan hat, aussichtslos ist. Dass man immer noch eine gute Richtung einschlagen kann, egal, wie schlimm es ist \u2013 solange man jemanden hat, der einem dabei hilft. Unverbl\u00fcmt und trotzdem ruhig erz\u00e4hlt Steve Earle hier eine Geschichte \u00fcber den Tod, um S\u00fcnden, Reue und Vergebung. Ich kannte ihn als Musiker vorher nicht richtig, aber dieses Buch vermittelt, was sonst wohl seine Songs vermitteln w\u00fcrden \u2013 nur mit einer gr\u00f6\u00dferen Auswahl an Worten. Ich kann mir vorstellen, dass die Botschaft und der Sinn des Buchs deshalb nicht ganz klar wird, damit es metaphorisch und interpretierbar bleibt wie ein Song. Dennoch h\u00e4tte ich bei einem Buch ein bisschen mehr Klarheit nicht schlecht gefunden. FazitEin eindrucksvoller Roman, der sich sehr gut lesen l\u00e4sst, der einen nachdenklich und zufrieden hinterl\u00e4sst, obwohl er so viele dunkle Themen behandelt. Lest die ersten Seiten, und ihr werdet das Buch zu Ende lesen wollen. Mir ist immer noch nicht klar, was es ist, das einen so in den Bann zieht \u2013 aber irgendetwas erzielt genau diesen Effekt. Einen halben Punkt Abzug gibt es daf\u00fcr, dass vor allem am Ende der rote Faden ein bisschen verloren geht.

This is a tremendously well-written and creative book with characters that slowly reveal themselves to be more complex and sympathetic than you might think, and a plot that mixes despair and hope with a little bit of mysticism. It's the fall of 1963 in a rundown neighborhood of San Antonio. Doc Ebersole is a disgraced former physician struggling with a severe morphine addiction\u2014and he's being haunted by the ghost of his former patient and fishing buddy, Hank Williams. (The rumor is that Doc gave Williams the morphine shot that might have killed him.) Doc lives in a boarding house and, in an effort to support his habit, treats the local criminals, prostitutes and drug dealers for sexually transmitted diseases, gun and knife wounds, and other injuries and illnesses\u2014and performs abortions for women who find themselves \"in trouble.\" Into this mess comes Graciela, a young Mexican immigrant in need of Doc's services. She stays with Doc after she recovers, and after she sustains a wound that won't seem to heal, she discovers her ability to heal Doc's patients and send them on the road to a new life. But not everyone is happy about these supposed miracles\u2014including the local clergy nor Hank Williams' ghost. This book really took me by surprise. When I started reading it I thought it would be a harrowing story of a man near the end of his rope, struggling with a debilitating addiction yet trying to help others to feed his habit. But Doc was much more complex than I expected, and the people that surrounded him, including Graciela, were layered, fascinating people. I even found the mystical parts of the book enjoyable, although I felt the subplot with the local priest to be a bit unnecessary. Even as I had suspicions where the book would go, I savored every page. Earle is a talented writer, and he has created a fascinating little world that might not be pretty or happy, but it sure is interesting.

Doc Ebersole was once a fairly respected physician, but all that began to change when he got mixed up with Hank Williams. Then he basically became the guy who kept Hank's back pain at bay with a steady supply of morphine, right up to the night he gave Hank that fateful shot that finally killed him as he lay in the back seat of his Cadillac. Since that fateful night, Doc has been haunted by Hank's ghost. Now he has lost his licence to practice medicine and has been drifting from city to city, only to wind up living in the Yellow Rose boarding house in the run-down red light district of San Antonio. Here he treats the assorted wounds from guns and knives that the locals acquire in fights, or just as innocent bystanders, and provides the prostitutes with the occasional abortion that keeps them on the job, all the while feeding his own monstrous morphine habit. The other primary occupier of his time is arguing with Hank's ghost, mostly in his dreams and during those times when he is soaring on morphine. His life is changed when a young pregnant girl named Graciela is dropped off by her punk boyfriend, who is never seen again. When a group of admirers from the neighborhood makes a pilgrimage to the local airport to see Jackie Kennedy arrive, Graciela sustains a wound to her wrist that will not heal, but she is apparently also given special healing powers to go along with the wound.

In \"I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive\", Earle renders the anti-hero into a hero, addiction falls into redemption, and those meant to be Saints are the worst sinners of all. Doc, the main character, is a morphine addicted former MD stripped of his license. He is \"haunted\" by the ghost of Hank Williams (yes, THAT Hank Williams), whose presence and general obnoxious behavior seems to both prompt Doc to continue his downward spiral - and somehow comfort him as well. Doc affords his addiction by performing abortions for anyone who can pay for them. The abortions are performed in a rooming house - the same place where Doc lives. It seems like 'just another day' when Graciela arrives for her 'procedure'. She is dropped off - and abandoned - by the man who had impregnated her. Barely 18, illegal and afraid to return home after her abortion, Graciela transforms from a weak, quiet woman-child into Doc's assistant...and the healer of those around her. Be warned - this novel is not for the faint of heart. Abortion, addiction, prostitution and other 'less proper' things are spoken of in matter of fact terms. There is also liberal use of profanity/vulgarity within the novel. These were daily occurrences for the characters in the story. South Presa was not High Society, but all of the characters, despite their flaws (or sins) were all class acts. This is equally beautiful and brutal to read.

Also, I enjoy Earle's music.Earle's new book reads a bit like a country song. At times a bit exaggerated in order to fit the rhythms and storytelling tradition behind the genre. Doc is a man haunted by both his drug habit and his past in the form of Hank Williams's ghost. The reader will be captivated by the gritty reality of Doc's life as a dopehead and the people he must interact with, not only to feed his habit, but to absolve his past sins and hopefully make a difference in a troubled community. Things take a turn for the better and the stranger in Doc's story when a young Mexican girl named Graciela is dumped on him, she eventually begins to assist him in his abortions and other procedures. Graciela then develops stigmata and the ability to heal and begins changing the lives of those around her.This is a story of redemption and acceptance of God's plan, even when it goes against what has previously been taught. The story is a bit strange, and the drug usage is prolific and sometimes distressing, but I think a number of people will find this an interesting read."}, {"userName": "Jeremy Garber", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5896222-jeremy-garber", "userReview": "Steve Earle\u2019s first novel, set in San Antonio in 1963, is a sweet but flawed story about drugs, heroism, race, spirituality and religion, and ornery Texans. The protagonist, Doc, is a former physician with a serious heroin problem who makes a living providing illegal abortions to the outcasts of society. Compounding his difficulties is the continuing mysterious presence of the ghost of Hank Williams, who may have been killed by Doc providing his last dose of smack. Doc\u2019s nosedive flophouse existence takes a sharp turn when he encounters a saintly Mexican teenager with the power to heal. Earle\u2019s dialogue is amusing and his powers of description effective. You might read Earle\u2019s book more sympathetically if you consider the characters as archetypes rather than human beings \u2013 they\u2019re a little cartoony to be the latter but work fairly well as the former. Unfortunately the ending (w/o spoilers) tends toward the stereotypical portrayal of evil institutional religion vs. good homegrown spirituality, but it\u2019s worth a good read on an overly hot afternoon with a PBR at hand."}, {"userName": "Jason Mills", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2892211-jason-mills", "userReview": "It's 1963 in Texas, and Doc is down on his luck. Haunted by the irascible ghost of his sometime friend and patient Hank Williams, Doc has fallen out of practice and into dope addiction, scraping by in a boarding house by performing back-street abortions for prostitutes and poor girls. One of these waifs, Graciela, is left behind with him, unable to speak English and with nowhere to go. Over time he and Graciela become partners - in 'crime', if not precisely in love - but her startling and inexplicable healing powers begin to draw unwelcome attention.This is a smart novel at the bottom of society. Steve Earle's prose is economic and pointed and he evokes the time and place very well. Ultimately the characters are fumbling towards ways to get right with themselves and their gods, and Earle deftly mixes elements from Mexican, Catholic and American cultures, his fantasy inclusions nodding towards magic realism. A word-fencing conversation between two priests, pulled out of a hat near the end, is a particular treat. The book is a heartening yet clear-sighted redemption song."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "This book combines reality with magical realism,involving a supporting cast of colorful drifters, drug addicts, prostitutes, a priest, a cop, and Graciela the Mexican healer. The action revolves around Doc Ebersole who lives with the angry ghost of Hank Williams in the Yellow Rose boarding house in San Antonio in 1963. Doc had given Hank several morphine injections just prior to his death, and the ghost of Hank seems to be waiting around so that they can eventually travel to their final reward together.The story is a crazy trip, sometimes humorous and sometimes sad, as Doc practices medicine on the wrong side of the law, specializing in abortions and gunshot wounds. Graciela, with her magical healing, transforms the lives of the addicts and hookers in a positive direction.Underneath the humor and magical realism, the reader can also understand the reality of life for this population living on the edge in the red-light district."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337746-lisa", "userReview": "I am so glad Steve Earle read this novel himself because no one else could have done it justice. I loved the characters right down to Big Tiff. Well, maybe I didn't love Big Tiff, but I loved how Earle drew her, read her, made her come alive.The story itself was about the people most of us choose to ignore. We don't want to know about their wretched, chosen existence. Earle made them sympathetic or, at the very least, human. Strong in the eye of the storm, frail in the calm of the morning. These characters carry the story. The story is one of redemption, friendship, and love.

In 1963, ten years after Hank's death, Doc himself is wracked by addiction. Having lost his license to practice medicine, his morphine habit isn't as easy to support as it used to be. So he lives in a rented room in the red-light district on the south side of San Antonio, performing abortions and patching up the odd knife or gunshot wound. But when Graciela, a young Mexican immigrant, appears in the neighborhood in search of Doc's services, miraculous things begin to happen. Graciela sustains a wound on her wrist that never heals, yet she heals others with the touch of her hand. Everyone she meets is transformed for the better, except, maybe, for Hank's angry ghost\u2014who isn't at all pleased to see Doc doing well.\u00a0 A brilliant excavation of an obscure piece of music history, Steve Earle's I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive is also a marvelous novel in its own right, a ballad of regret and redemption, and of the ways in which we remake ourselves and our world through the smallest of miracles.", "title": "I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9861642-i-ll-never-get-out-of-this-world-alive", "average": 3.65, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347450870l/9861642.jpg", "reviews": 427, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/35957.Steve_Earle", "name": "Steve Earle"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Music", "Magical Realism"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9861642-i-ll-never-get-out-of-this-world-alive", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12405450-i-ll-never-get-out-of-this-world-alive", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15924375-i-ll-never-get-out-of-this-world-alive", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13591014-i-ll-never-get-out-of-this-world-alive", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11236399-i-ll-never-get-out-of-this-world-alive", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63887.Doghouse_Roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63888.Steve_Earle_Songbook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22511153-i-can-t-remember-if-we-said-goodbye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38881141-no-29", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21314780-goodbye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
