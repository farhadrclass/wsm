Can you imagine living in a series of caves deep underground for 344 days, without once seeing the sun? That is what a group of Jewish villagers, all related by blood or marriage, did to escape from the Nazis during World War II in Ukraine. The details of their life underground are described by the survivors, whom Taylor tracked down and interviewed. He then went to the Ukraine and joined a team of spelunkers to venture into the caves, where they found artifacts left behind by the villagers, including names that they wrote on the cave walls. Their physical and mental survival under such stressful conditions is a testament to their courage and familial bond. Taylor includes lots of photos of them then and now, as well as photos of the caves and the artifacts and a map of the cave system. If you think that living underground in a cave might be fun, this book will change your mind. Recommended for anyone interested in caves or the Holocaust\u2014a most unique narrative."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1841257-michael", "userReview": "Amazing story of survival, great photos.

This book is appealing for being about WWII survival, for being about caves, for being about living underground, and for having incredible photos. It's also tragic - the family's losses in the escape from one cave into the other, and the cruel way in which Jews who had managed to survive the Holocaust were treated even after the slaughter was over are heart-wrenching. I only wish that Sally Walker had written this book, because the writing is okay but not stellar, and there's a really annoying repeat in the text - there will be extended callout text (collected from what must be a fascinating unpublished account of the family's experience) that is exactly repeated in the smaller, regular text.

Summary: \"Two explorers survey caves in the Western Ukraine and relate the story of how an extended Jewish family, fleeing persecution by the Nazis, lived for two years in a large cave, Popowa Yama, and survived the war.\"The author talked to survivors, gathered old photos, talked to the modern-day cave explorers, and described day-to-day life underground. 36 people lived in this cave system for over a year. Those who did not sneak out to get supplies did not see sunlight (or moonlight) for over 300 days. I found it fascinating that they completely broke the Official World Record of the man who voluntarily spent 200+ days underground (he had catered meals and stayed warm). The Jewish families in Ukraine were starving, wet and cold, but they pulled together and survived.

On one of the trips, he heard locals telling stories about Jews who had gone into a cave during World War II, but no one was sure what happened to them. In his explorations, he found man-made walls and artifacts, and began to search for information. Nearly ten years later, there was an email from the neighbor of Sol Wexler, who was one of the 38 survivors. This is the story of Sol, his cousins the Stermers, the Dodyk family and the Kurz family. As Jews in wartime Eastern Europe, they faced being forced into Nazi ghettos and death camps. Instead, they chose leave their homes at midnight on October 12, 1942 to hide in the first of two local caves. With no weapons and limited supplies, the group lived in fear, darkness, constant chill and damp, making dangerous supply runs at night. When the Nazis discovered their first hiding spot in late March of 1943, Esther Stermer blocked their advance and stood toe-to-toe with the commander, challenging him so that her family might have more time to escape through the hidden exit. The few who were captured managed to escape and return, and the group moved to the larger Popowa Yama cave where they lived in darkness until April 12, 1944. Family love and loyalty are central to this amazing story of courage and survival against all odds. The design of this book is color coded -- pages telling the survivors' stories are colored, with historic photographs and maps and quotes from Esther Stermer's own memoir of their time in the caves. Pages showing modern photos and details of the expeditions into the caves are white, with photos of artifacts within the caves. Part archaeology, part survival story, and all history, this is an amazing record of human strength and will. A must-read for the Holocaust unit in 8th grade"}, {"userName": "Sarah Wilbern", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34429349-sarah-wilbern", "userReview": "Taylor, P. & Nicola C. (2007). The Secret of Priest's Groto: A Holocaust Survival Story. Minnesota: Kar-Ben Publishing.2008 NCSS Notable Social Studies Trade Book for Young People.Informational Book Choice. This book was very interesting. It told the story of how a couple of families stuck together to live during WWII and the Holocaust. One of the main Families talked about their experience during WWII and the Holocaust. They were scared for their lives, they didn't know if they were going to live throughout the war. They stuck together and risked their lives to get food and the needed materials they needed. They were determined not to go to a concetration camp, because they knew that was an automatic death sentence. They fled their town in search for a good hiding spot. The first place they hid was in a popular tourist attraction cave. They lived there for a few months when the cave wasn't open to the public. But, then they were found by the Germans. Most of them escaped. The families then made their way to Popowa Yama -Priest's Groto. Here is where they would spend almost a year in hiding, trying to stay safe. The men of the camp would only venture out at night for food and supplies. A few people who lived around the groto helped teh Families in the Groto. One night, the families almost were killed because Nazis Police had found their hiding place. But, fortunately the near by farmer's destracted th Nazis. This is a good book for 4-12 graders. It tells the story of how some Jewish people survived the Holocaust and WWII. This book wasn't too violent for young children. This book would be good to teach children about a historical event."}, {"userName": "Kandace", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1925676-kandace", "userReview": "The Secret of Priest\u2019s Grotto relates the story of how several Jewish families survived the Holocaust of WWII by hiding in the caves of western Ukraine for over 300 days.

I liked how it showed how they found out about these people showing the old shoes, keys and other artifacts they found, while exploring the cave in first person. I also like how the narrator shows the people while they where hiding in the cave from the nazis. This book did change my perspective I thought a cave would be impossible for people to find them easy to survive in cause it under ground and shelter from the weather but I was wrong. During this book I found out that their supplies ran out fast and the humidity in the cave condenses making there clothing wet and at night putting them at risk of hypothermia. During the book it talked a about the getting more supplies, almost getting killed by people or sickness and it shows the grand children of these people. I really enjoyed how it described what it was like for the people hiding in the cave and kinda made me feel like I was there.

Yet, during World War II, that is just what a small band of Eastern European Jews did to survive. To date, no other persons have come close to living underground in the conditions they did for so many continuous days, enduring sensory deprivation, near starvation, and physical and psychological discomfort.  This book details the methods by which the caves were explored and how the archeological evidence of the group's existence was discovered bit by bit during the expedition undertaken by the author to document this amazing Holocaust story.  Fortunately, several survivors were alive and willing to be interviewed for this book; their insights added a very meaningful emotional layer that enhanced my entire reading experience.

Several extended families hid in these caves for 1.5 years until the Russians drove out the Germans above ground in April 1944. Their ages span from 2 - 76 years old. This was one of the hardest documentary viewing experiences ever. Not only did the researcher find numerous survivors to retell their tales, their hardships were etched so indelibly that they, in turn, imprinted them upon us when we viewed their testimonies. Note: the bulk of their testimonies was taken at face value by the movie maker. Besides physical evidence in the cave (stove, stone flour mill, personal effects) that prove they were once there, there was no collaboration on other parts of their story such as duration & circumstances.

Taylor and Nicola present the harrowing tale of Jewish families who escape to underground caves to survive the Holocaust.

Taylor and Nicola alternate details of their modern day cave exploration (of the sites inhabited by displaced Jewish families), with the reflections and images of those families. This technique effectively draws in the reader, attaching modern significance to harrowing tales.
