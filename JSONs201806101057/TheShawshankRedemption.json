It's hope that keeps you going - even after everything horrible that you can ever imagine has already happened to you, even after life has knocked you down over and over again, even after there seems to be nothing left. Hope is the last thing to die, they say. Andy Dufresne has taken that saying to heart, apparently.The Shawshank Redemption is a prime example of why Stephen King will always remain among my favorite authors. Branded a horror writer, a representative of a genre that is so easy and tempting to altogether judge and dismiss by book snobs lovers\u00b9 (and I have been among them on more than one occasion, I must confess) results in way too frequent overlooking of his captivating storytelling skills and excellent character development that is the driving force behind his stories. His best books - and this is one of them, undeniably - are based on \"what if?\" approach, and then watching his characters try to find their way out of the \"what if?\" situation, shaping themselves in the process of writing into fully fleshed figures which are so much more than just the vehicles for necessities of plot development.\u00b9 From Neil Gaiman's interview with King:\"I was down here in the supermarket, and this old woman comes around the corner, this old woman \u2013 obviously one of the kind of women who says whatever is on her brain. She said, 'I know who you are, you are the horror writer. I don\u2019t read anything that you do, but I respect your right to do it. I just like things more genuine, like that Shawshank Redemption.'And I said, 'I wrote that'. And she said, 'No you didn\u2019t'. And she walked off and went on her way.\"\nThe Shawshank Redemption is the story narrated by Red, a prisoner at the fictional Shawshank prison in Maine, immortalized by Morgan Freeman (what a fitting last name!) in a well-known Frank Darabont screen adaptation of this book. Red tells us the story of his fellow prisoner Andy Dufresne, falsely accused of a murder he did not commit and sentenced to a life behind bars as a result. Andy, a small calm level-headed former banker, who would seem to be destined for the role of perpetual victim in the place where brawn seems to be worth more than brains, where he has met violence and humiliation and senseless brutality from both guards and prisoners. It was a place destined to break Andy's spirit. It's supposed to do that to everyone. That's the point.And yet Andy Dufresne calmly refuses to be broken. Andy so fiercely clings to his humanity, to his hope that he becomes a legend. His demeanor - that of a free man even caged seemingly forever - is what gives hope to others, especially Red, his friend and narrator.\n\"So yeah - if you asked me to give you a flat-out answer to the question of whether I'm trying to tell you about a man or a legend that got made up around the man, like a pearl around a little piece of grit - I'd have to say that the answer lies somewhere in between. All I know for sure is that Andy Dufresne wasn't much like me or anyone else I ever knew since I came inside. He brought in five hundred dollars jammed up his back porch, but somehow that graymeat son a bitch managed to bring in something else as well. A sense of his own worth, maybe, or a feeling that he would be the winner in the end... or maybe it was only a sense of freedom, even inside these goddamned gray walls. It was a kind of light he carried around with him.\"\nAndy Dufresne meticulously and patiently clings to a bit of hope, so irrational and fickle that anyone would have given up. And it's this hope, so inherent to his nature, that allows him to retain his humanity and quiet but undeniable dignity in a place where neither is supposed to exist. Violence, corruption, power, greed, cruelty - Andy goes through it all with his unexpected backbone of steel, allowing all of it to only barely tarnish his amazing resilient spirit, winning his little victories against the system along the way, in his own way brightening the existence of those for whom there'd appear to be little left, patiently fighting his fight to keep little glimpses of humanity in the place where they are rarely seen.\n\"Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you. And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.\"\nI first read this book as a fourteen-year-old teenage cynical know-it-all - and when I got to the end, I cried. Because it hit me then how, despite my teenage sense of invulnerability, the world can be cruel to you for no reason, and sometimes hope is all you have left. Now I'm twice that age, having seen a bit of the life's cruelty that King so frequently alludes to, and I no longer cry at the ending of this book; instead, I marvel with a feeling of sadness and quiet fascination at how aptly he captured the need to keep going despite all odds, even when it appears there is nothing left to live and hope for. Because hope dies last, and sometimes you just need to see it through to the end. And as long as you haven't lost yourself, your inner little sense of worth, there remains something to live and fight for.\n\"I find I am excited, so excited I can hardly hold the pencil in my trembling hand. I think it is the excitement that only a free man can feel, a free man starting a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.I hope Andy is down there.I hope I can make it across the border.I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.I hope.\""}, {"userName": "Nayra.Hassan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL":

Almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. What makes this book different is the message it conveys - one of eternal hope. I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope, friendship, and redemption. The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufresne, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.Stephen King is one of the most enchanting storytellers of our time, and perhaps, the only one alive. His prose is equally enchanting, wonderful, and mesmerizing. It was a sheer delight to read him. And, by the way, it was my first Stephen King novel. All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is a riveting tale about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck, that will leave you in utter amazement!

I've vowed to read more Stephen King because if you skip those of the horror genre, his other books are such wonderful, human stories. Having recently been in on some discussions of another prison book, The Enchanted, I couldn't help but compare the two books as I read along. I love both books, with their similarities and dissimilarities; but Shawshank offers such hope and redemption (I mean it is right there in the title), that I think that gives it an edge with me. Also the characters of Red and Andy are so great. The narrator on the audio was not Morgan Freeman--darn--but was very good.

from expressions like 'awesome', 'mind-blowing' or 'must-read', not too much can be said about stories like these. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why I tend to enjoy writing snarky reviews of books I disliked way more than trying to compose a decent review on a story I loved and want everyone else to read as well.\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" is one of them. I have to admit, I am a huge fan of prison stories and the way they are able to explore what imprisonment and isolation from society can do to a human's mind. Stephen King managed to explore this in such a perfect way, allowing hope and despair to flow into his words simultaneously. I've read many other reviews emphasizing it, and I can only sign what they are writing: this is not only a story about life in prison (which, by the way, is depicted in a very realistic way - not that I would be able to judge how life in prison really feels like, but at least King managed to convince me this is how it would feel like to be imprisoned for more than thirty years), but also a story about hope. And it is perfectly done. Not many stories before have been able to nearly reduce me to tears at the ending, but \"Shawshank Redemption\" is one of them.It's no long story and, thus, will not take much time to read, so I can highly recommend giving it a try. Now, watching the movie version with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins will gain a high place on my to-do-list (right beneath reading more Stephen King novels), as nearly everybody seems to have watched this movie - and loved it - except for me."}, {"userName": "KamRun", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12342179-kamrun", "userReview": "\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u06a9\u0632\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0627\u0642\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0633 \u0622\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0686\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06af\u0646 \u0631\u0650\u062f\u061f \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06af\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0648\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0647\u200c\u0627\u06cc \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0648 \u0628\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u062a\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc\u0645 \u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0648\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u067e\u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0646\u0645\n\u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u067e\u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u0627\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0634\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0631 (\u0648 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0633\u06cc\u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0622\u0646 \u0628\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u06cc\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0648 \u0645\u06a9\u200c\u06a9\u0648\u0626\u06cc\u0646)\u060c \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0627\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631\u06cc: \u0631\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0627\u0648\u0634\u0646\u06a9 \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0628\u0647\u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0698\u0627\u0646\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0633\u0648\u0628 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0631 \u062f\u0648 \u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646\u200c\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u200c\u0627\u06cc \u06cc\u06a9\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0646\u062f: \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u0631\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u062f\u062a\u200c\u0647\u0627 \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u062e\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u0622\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u062e\u062a \u0622\u06cc\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0648\u0644 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u0686\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u0622\u0645\u062f!

Probably not.I cannot believe I have never read this. Actually, I listened to the audio and the narrator was superb. Having seen the movie countless times and identifying it as my all-time favorite, I pictured Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins throughout the story but that neither added to nor detracted from the experience for me...and this was just that...an experience.

Period. For anyone out there who accuses King of not beinjg able to write well, this set should end that argument.Shawshank: \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" is a masterpiece. A streamlined cast of characters and clever telling of the story using the narrator as a main character, only to shift into first person to finish the story with expectant yet unresolved hope.Apt Pupil: Scary. Really spooky stuff. Not so much for the blood and gore, although I had an itchy feeling know how much thought the author put into how to properly knife a hobo to death. No, the creepiest idea is that a person could come so far off the tracks and still be able to function undetected in society. Very believably done.The Body: Almost sweet in its recollection of waning childhood. A story of friendships doomed to end, innocence dead but not yet buried, and a quest to see something awful leads to understanding. Written by another man at another time, this story might be considered a classic. I hope someday it's recognized as such.Breathing Method: The weakest sotry of the bunch, and tip of the hat to people who love King for his ability to shock and get all the \"gooshy\" stuff just right.

If you have not seen the movie, stop reading my review and go watch the film. It is amazing. I have recently discovered the 'free' audio-books on the library. (Thank you tax dollars). The Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King is a relatively short book. It is also a short audio book, only 3 cassettes (my POS car has a tape-deck). Frank Muller narrates Stephen King's tale of prison life. Here's the thing, if you must audio a cassette, don't get an old cassette from the library, buy a new one. With me, it just skipped and pretty much stopped playing, so I had to plead with the powers that be to let me finish the story of Red and Andy Dufresne.Bitching and moaning aside, I thought Frank Muller's voice was perfect for the story. He sounds like a grizzled felon with a heart of gold. As audio-book connoisseurs know, the voice really adds or detracts from a book.I felt the characters were fascinating. I genuinely liked Andy Dufresne, disliked the corrupt guards known as screws, and Red - the man who can get you anything in prison. Andy embodies hope within the most confining circumstances, jailed for murder of his wife and her lover -- he really has little hope of parole. There's no way he'd ever get out, as the DA used Andy's case as leverage into a higher position. You have the guards who represent the institution, who do their best to exploit Andy's tax-preparing expertise, and try to squelch Andy's hope. You have Red who's been in jail for so long that it feels safe to him, he has a position of prominence within the prison as the man who can get anything. Red makes for an intriguing study of the psychological effect of institutionalization.I loved King's writing style, he can really make me guffaw, then feel broken hearted, then fit to burst with joy all on one page. I know some people hate King and his super-long books, but I am an unabashed King fan. I think there is a reason he is the king of horror, and I think his efforts to reach into other genres are fantastic (i.e. The Green Mile -- wasn't horror to me), so maybe I do have some bias. I love that King makes me contemplate the freedom of being able to see the night-sky unimpeded by bars.However, I will admit, I felt the movie was definitely better. There is a reason it is the number one user voted film on IMDB.com."}, {"userName": "Nelly", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73636846-nelly", "userReview": "\u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, \u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b7, \u03c4\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03cc\u03bb\u03b1!!"}, {"userName": "kostas  vamvoukakis", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14057149-kostas-vamvoukakis", "userReview": "140 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1...\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1...\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2...\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae"}, {"userName": "Nu-Jahat-Jabin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28423887-nu-jahat-jabin", "userReview": "\u098f\u0995\u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 \u09ac\u0987 \u09af\u09c7\u099f\u09be\u09b0 \u09ac\u0987 \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u09ae\u09c1\u09ad\u09bf\u099f\u09be \u09ac\u09c7\u09b6\u09bf \u0985\u09b8\u09be\u09a7\u09be\u09b0\u09a8 \u09b2\u09c7\u0997\u09c7\u099b\u09c7\u0964 \u09ae\u09b0\u0997\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a8 \u09ab\u09cd\u09b0\u09bf\u09ae\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a8\u09c7\u09b0 \u0995\u09a3\u09cd\u09a0\u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09b0 <3"}, {"userName": "Mia (Parentheses Enthusiast)", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23106940-mia-parentheses-enthusiast", "userReview": "\"Well you weren't writing about yourself, I hear someone in the peanut-gallery saying. You were writing about Andy Dufresne. You're nothing but a minor character in your own story. But you know, that's just not so. It's all about me, every damned word of it. Andy was the part of me they could never lock up, the part of me that will rejoice when the gates finally open for me and I walk out in my cheap suit with my twenty dollars of mad-money in my pocket. That part of me will rejoice no matter how old and broken and scared the rest of me is.\"God, I love this story. It really is timeless, and just wonderful. It's a story in the old fashion, with an incredible plot and characters that interact meaningfully and a great setting that binds it all up... There's nothing abstract or unreachable about it, and I think it's one of the most accessible and easy-to-relate-to tales I've ever read. There's just something about Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption that plays into our human desires: the desire for justice, the burning need we have for wrongs to be put right, the way we respect and root for people who deserve better than what they got. It's so appealing on so many levels, and since it's well-written and touching to boot, this story really is perfect.I've mentioned elsewhere how I love moral greyness and the vast area between black and white, but every now and then I need some good old-fashioned good vs. bad, wrong vs. right. I've loved books with almost no plot to speak of\u2014 The Road and  Wolf in White Van\u2014but now and again I need a simple yet compelling plot, one that makes sense and has all the trapping of a story. Not a character study, not an exploration of morality, a STORY. Sometimes as a reader I feel like a child who just wants to curl up and listen to their parents read them a bedtime story, and while Red makes it clear that prison is no place for fairytales, this one has that same calming, spellbinding effect.The film adaptation of this is my favourite movie of all time, as I suspect is the case for many people, and I know you're wondering: Which is better, the movie or the book? Well, I'll have to chalk this one up to one of those rare occasions like The Princess Bride where they're both equally great. I have to give credit to the filmmakers here, because they kept all the good parts intact and left everything more or less unchanged, and what they added enhances the story rather than obscures it. I'm also kind of in awe as to how they captured Red's voice so well; even apart from the voice-over parts (most of which is exact quotes from the novella), the way the plot unfolds is so spot-on when compared to the narrator's straightforward, earnest, yet thoughtful way of storytelling in the novella.Other than that, there's not too much more I can say, other than I recommend this novella to... well, pretty much everyone. If you have a heart and a pair of eyes and the ability to read, you'll find something to love about this story._______________________________PRE-REVIEW, 25 AUGUST 2017:Here I am sitting in a hair salon among the sounds of ladies chattering and blowdryers and pop music, blinking away tears, feeling like the oldest ex-con walking away from Shawshank Prison, getting his first taste of that cold bracing air that whispers freedom.Hope springs eternal, indeed.Review to come shortly."}, {"userName": "Brit Cheung", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49013470-brit-cheung", "userReview": "Every time I Saw the movie, it would give entirely new perspective from which I could continuously break the old self and entrench the new.

Hearing the story from Red's gentle and detailed perspective was intriguing. Red has a great sense of humor throughout the book. He tells the story in a way that allows you to see the passing of time. This is not as evident in the movie version. Although short, this book gives the reader something to hope for in their own life. I also loved the peek into the prison world. It's hard to imagine the living conditions that some prisoners face. Best of all I think was that Red was a murderer. That may seem irrelevant. However, I feel that Red did change. He made a mistake, but that mistake was not the entirety of his existence. He was a man with deep emotion, skill, trustworthiness, and he was Andy's friend.

the entire collection, Different Seasons. I intend to read it at some point, but when I came across this audiobook I couldn't pass it up.The enduring fame of Shawshank is in large part thanks to the film. I've found many people are surprised to hear that Stephen King wrote it. I'm guessing these are the same people that believe he's just a horror writer, and here you can almost hear the strained twang of elitism in the voice. But sorry, Charlie, Uncle Steve has a bag and it's full of tricks. For my part, I sort of assumed before listening to the novella that sure, the story would be okay, but the film was obviously going to be a major improvement. You could say I was right and wrong about that.Frank Darabont's 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever made. It's also one of the most watchable. Directed, casted, shot, scored, and scripted to near perfection, there's hardly a naysayer willing to show his face. Sometimes in a group project like filmmaking the parts just come together, and like a good symphony it creates something truly special. It's not surprising, then, that some folks might approach the novella with suspicion. It's a legitimate fear: how the hell could anything possibly compete with something that good, even if it is the friggin source material?The bridge, I believe, is that the two were very close. Yes, the film had the opportunity to smooth over and rearrange the plot a little. The novella strikes me as slightly more plausible and realistic in retrospect, and seems more bent on character than a prison break story. There were a few minor alterations such as the character of Warden Norton\u2013\u2013who is a composite of three characters from the novella\u2013\u2013being given a more substantial role as a villain. But in general the differences were mild.I enjoyed the reader. He captured the smooth rolling quality of King's prose, and even though he was attempting to compete in a sense with Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding\u2013\u2013or suicide, as I would normally call it\u2013\u2013there weren't many times aside from the final monologue where I thought a change of cast was in order.I once again stop shy of five stars because the novella, while a wonderfully engrossing read, was not quite as good as the movie. I reserve the sacred five star rating for things like the film, the unforgettable, the near numinous works of art that go unfazed by time and use. They were close, but there is a gap between them. And so I would say that while the film was an improvement, it was not a major one. Read the story, and be merry.\"I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it is the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope....\""}, {"userName": "Veronika Duritzdeschain", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5998835-veronika-duritzdeschain", "userReview": "One of the few books in history that was actually as good as its on screen counterpart, although how they managed to squeeze so much screen time out of such a short story still amazes me. I originally read this book when I was 16, missing my school prom to finish it and I loved it then as I love it now. The true mark of a good story is one that can be told time and time again without you ever realising that you have read it before. This is certainly one of those great stories, from an equally great compliation book (Different Seasons) and THE great Stephen King."}, {"userName": "Ashish Iyer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38414168-ashish-iyer", "userReview": "I hadn't read a truly frightening book of his. Yes, King's novels are disturbing, but not scary. A truly powerful yet disturbing account of an injustice law system, and the effects it has on a young man's life. Although imprisoned unjustly, he doesn't complain: it is not in his character. Instead, he decides to fight the system: not with his fists, with his mind. He succeeds. If you liked the movie, you will not be dissapointed in the moody, honest and bold novel. But in the sad case when you haven't seen the movie, don't read the book."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "I liked this. It was probably 3 stars for me, but just because I loved the writing, I will add an extra star. I love Stephen King's writing. His characters are richly drawn. There is so much vivid detail that makes them leap from the page. I always love that. There is always a special emphasis on the emotions as well. These details didn't just apply to the characters, but they were also poured into the setting so that you could truly see it."}, {"userName": "Gwen (The Gwendolyn Reading Method)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250598-gwen-the-gwendolyn-reading-method", "userReview": "Can see why it's a classic"}], "description": "A man convicted of murder lives in a prison brutally ruled by a sadistic warden and secretly run by a con who knows all the ropes and pulls all the strings.", "title": "The Shawshank Redemption", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9836767-the-shawshank-redemption", "average": 4.52, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1291588016l/9836767.jpg", "reviews": 942, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King", "name": "Stephen King"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/40573.Frank_Muller", "name": "Frank  Muller"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Short Stories", "Horror", "Audiobook"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9836767-the-shawshank-redemption", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39664.Rita_Hayworth_and_Shawshank_Redemption", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25012164", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33799256", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35484747", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531681.The_Shawshank_Redemption", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15361310-shawshank-redempt-27", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4945932-the-shawshank-redemption", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11588.The_Shining", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149267.The_Stand", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10614.Misery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43615.The_Gunslinger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10592.Carrie"]}
