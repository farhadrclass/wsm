I come from a huge family and nearly all of my sisters are married, except me. I started reading this book today, while dealing with some drama with a boy friend. Half way through today, he broke up with me, half way through this book I realized what God wants from me. Never have I read a book that struck home. I was in tears for most of the book, because I relate so much to Jessie. This line from the book struck home for me. \" you are worth more. You are worth a guy who is willing to stake everything he has on you, not some guy who wants to give you a test run while he picks up the pieces of his life.\" I sobbed when I read that. That's what my ex was doing with me. It's like God had this author write this book for me. I'm worth more then a measly test run, and I can see what God has in store for me. I can fully surrender my \"purple pen\" to God for Him to write my story, and it will be an amazing one at that!"}, {"userName": "Casey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3194216-casey", "userReview": "I loved this book, I read it in one afternoon I loved it so much. I really wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect from the premise. A 30 something woman who can\u2019t fall in love embarks on a romance with God \u2013 in the flesh \u2013 here on earth!Could the authors pull it off??Oh. Yeah.This book is fantastic! So good in fact I want to read it over and over. What I loved so much is the authors never put words in God\u2019s mouth. All the examples of what God did in the story can be found in scripture as relating to the God we serve. As a young woman who is a hopeless romantic and can sometimes wait most impatiently for Mr. Right, I wanted to fall deeper in love with God. \u201cNever the Bride\u201d pushed me to trust and love deeper with my God, to give my love story writing back to Him.I wish I could go on and on! The book has humor (I haven\u2019t laughed this much from a book since Janice Thompson\u2019s Bella), it has character, it has charm. And the HERO?? Ladies, take my word for it: this is one awesome hero. And not only that, it has a message the young (and maybe not so young) hopeless romantics need to read. Who can\u2019t help but fall in love with a hero as amazing as our Lord and Savior??This review is my honest opinion. Thanks to the publishers for my copy to review."}, {"userName": "Jane Maritz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2385656-jane-maritz", "userReview": "I have to be honest here. A chapter or so into the book, I was rather disappointed. It was like a shallow chick-lit; all about trying to find a guy. Nothing wrong with chick-lit when I'm in the mood for it, but I was expecting something a little more substantial.Well, that all changed when God suddenly showed up in the storyline. Literally. And He wasn't who I expected. And that made me think. (Not necessarily agree, but think.) And suddenly all the witty romantic dialogue wasn't so shallow any more.Oh yeah. When I realized one of the authors was a screenwriter, it made perfect sense that I was visualizing this story on the big screen all the way through. The quirky dialogue and the action. Scenes kept flashing into my mind: Evan Almighty. 27 Dresses. The Wedding Planner. Etc.So yes, this book has the elements of successful chick lit. Fast-paced, witty, funny, feminine, romantic, with chocolate, purple pens, surprise twists, and a happy ending. If that interests you, you'll enjoy the book. But watch out for that serious God line. And let it challenge your perspective about how God wants to write the intimate details of YOUR life."}, {"userName": "Christy Lockstein", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379040-christy-lockstein", "userReview": "Never the Bride by Cheryl McKay and Rene Gutteridge is a charming novel of romance and faith. Jessie Stone has always lived by the rules; her friends can set their watches by her punctuality, and she's almost OCD in her need for order and control. She's lived all of her 34 years waiting for Mr. Right to sweep her off her feet, filling 109 journals with dreams of the perfect marriage proposal and wedding. Speed dating and online match services aren't working, but when God literally steps in and offers to help, Jessie isn't sure if she's willing to trust Him enough to do it to her standards! This book reminded me of all the reasons I love to read! It was funny and sweet and charming and had a strong message of faith. God's appearance in Jessie's life is beautiful and heart-breaking. Her friends and family think that she needs to be committed when they catch her talking to herself, and when she tries to tell them the truth, they ask her why is she so special that God would choose to step into her life. Their reactions are perfectly rendered, and oh so true of how I think people really would react to Jessie's story. God asks Jessie if she's willing to let Him write her life story, and there's a lesson in her story for readers. Her date with God brought tears to my eyes, as did their confrontation on the beach. The entire book was pitch perfect, just flawless. I laughed, I cried, I learned a lesson about my Savior. It doesn't get any better than that."}, {"userName": "Nora St Laurent", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1100689-nora-st-laurent", "userReview": "\u201cYou don\u2019t know me yet, so there is no reason you should care that I\u2019m stuck on a highway with a blowout. But maybe we can relate to each other.\u201d Don\u2019t you just love these first lines of the book? They totally made me want to know what happened next. This story definitely went in a direction I didn\u2019t expect, and I was pleasantly surprised!This book reminded me of the movie Evan Almighty. Evan realized that strange things were happening in his life. They really got weird when he met God. Then God wanted him to build an ark. Jessie isn\u2019t asked to build an ark but God asks impossible things of her- or so she thinks.Authors Cheryl and Rene describe the single life and how people are creative about meeting one another. They describe the Valentines rush dating process that is hysterical and sad all at the same time. One friend says,\u201d \u2026you can tell a lot about a guy by what he asks you.\u201d Boy is that so true.Here\u2019s what Jessie thinks of God, \u201cGod has never been in the business of coming to my rescue. Or doing anything for me, for that matter.\u201d So, why should she listen to Him now? It\u2019s probably not Him- she thinks \u2026just the return of her childhood imaginary friend. It could happen. Or she could be going crazy! She was rooting for the imaginary friend.Jessie argues with God when she says,\u201d Everything I\u2019ve accomplished in my life, I\u2019ve done myself. Me. Alone. Why should I trust you..?\u201dI loved what she thinks God is saying to her; \u201cYou haven\u2019t asked me for help\u2026Of course, you can keep doing things your way. Is that\u2019s working for you.\u201dI remember this very statement being said to me,\u201d Is what your doing working for you, Nora?\u201d It really stopped me in my tracks. No, it hadn\u2019t been working at all!! I had to surrender my will for His. That\u2019s what God is asking her to do too. Jessie thinks this is the craziest thing on the planet to do..surrender?\u2026never! \u201cI\u2019m a woman. In case you didn\u2019t notice. I don\u2019t have to make sense.\u201d Jessie has all the answers\u2014or so she thinks! Grin!This story will touch your heart, make you laugh out loud and choke you up and bring happy tears to your eyes. The Lord touched me deeply when I read about Jessie\u2019s struggles in life and how God was trying to get her attention. Oh, Lord if I only listened to you when you told me to do things the first time. The Lord loves us so much if we all could get a hold of that concept the world would be a different place. God is the ultimate gentleman, patiently waiting for us to run into His arms of Love; where we can feel safe, secure, deeply and utterly loved. I don\u2019t know about you, but I want that. This book reminds me of when I first received God\u2019s love in my heart and realized how much God loves me. It reminded me I\u2019m not alone in the struggle to do what He\u2019s asked me to do\u2026.no matter what it is. You\u2019ll want to read this over and over again.

The main character of this book, Jessie Stone, was a role model for a TSTL-heroine, pathetic and continuously complaining about her fate not to be married. Her main goal in life was to have a family and someone who loves her - what is per se a valid goal for (almost) everyone. This plot alone to find Mr. Right could fill a book and the author had the nice idea to add God into the mix too. One day (he seems to have had enough about her complaining and decided to help her - just to be rid of her whining, I assume) God appears \u2013 invisible for everyone but Jessie \u2013 to help her to achieve her goal. Of course Jessie doesn\u00b4t first believe it\u00b4s really God (who would) and of course she doesn\u00b4t follow his advices or requests to go to certain places or do certain things, no she\u00b4s too self-absorbed in her own greatness and husband obsession and clearly her failings to find her special someone are based on her inability to make compromises. I think this book is labeled to be comedy but I didn\u00b4t find it particularly funny, no giggling on my part as some others reviewers mentioned.I just found the heroine annoying and her lack of faith tiresome but eventually after suffering some harsh setbacks at the husband-hunting-front she finally relents to God\u00b4s will and her happy end is within reach...I have to confess that although this book wasn\u00b4t bad it just wasn\u00b4t my cup of tea and I was disappointed with the heroine who was too obsessed with her husband hunting for my taste.

Hopefully, I am not a drama queen in the negative sort or connotation that this label elicits, but in the very fact that I\u2019m in charge of the drama program at my church. Why do I tell you this? It\u2019s because of the advice that my pastor always gives me- he says, \u201cPlease pick the comedy skits, because you get to people\u2019s hearts through the back door with them, not hitting them over the head with the heavy stuff, it just sort of gently comes to them through their own laughter.\u201d And so I comply with his requests- you will find this concept brilliantly executed with Cheryl McKay\u2019s and Rene Gutteridge\u2019s novel Never the Bride. There is no hitting you over the head, but lots of laughter and great insight, if you pay attention. We meet Jessie Stone broken down on the side of Pacific Coast Highway with a flat tire bemoaning the fact that there is no guy in her life to take care of these frustrations for her. Yes, the title of the book Never the Bride sums up her attitude on life in spades. After failed online dating services, failed speed dating, and just plain old failed relationships, Jessie Stone is at the end of her \u201cforever single\u201d rope. And then enters a tall, dark, and handsome man with gorgeous blue eyes. Hmmm the answer to her dreams (?) - Oh yeah, but maybe not as she thought. It\u2019s God Almighty in the flesh trying to get Jessie to see things His way, that He might have a few ideas on how to handle her love life. Does she listen to Him? Well, sort of, but with a few detours of her own. This story is told with a wonderful sense of humor, a brilliant fresh writing voice and is a plain, absolute joy to read. As this was written as a screenplay first (Cheryl McKay) and adapted to a novelization later (Rene Gutteridge), it is easy to see how it would make a great movie, but trust me it works as a great novel as well. The scenes are very easy to visualize, especially the scenes where God shows up in various times and places and completely un-nerves our heroine Jessie Stone. His timing is always off according to Jessie and right on time according to God. He manages to get her completely outside of her comfort zone with regards to her ideas on her profession, her beliefs with regards to Him, as well as, of course, her love life. But isn\u2019t God like that- His ways are always better than ours, if we will just listen.So from this drama queen to you I say\u201d Bravo\u201d on \u201cNever the Bride\u201d and I will be rushing to the Movie theaters if this is made into a movie. It was darling, winsome and full of great spiritual messages. I can think of quite a few friends to recommend this book to and I truly hope to see Cheryl McKay and Rene Gutteridge team up again- they are a formidable force. 5 stars."}, {"userName": "April Parrish", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17824910-april-parrish", "userReview": "This book was great! I've always loved Rene Gutteridge, and this book was no exception. I literally laughed out loud MANY times--so funny! I also found myself very much relating to the main character. We have a lot in common. I do, however, have one complaint about the book. I feel that God is portrayed a little irreverently. I get the idea behind it and the reason for it as far as the book is concerned. However, though I firmly believe that God is interested in every detail of our lives, and is walking with us as Christians each step of the way, I take issue with how He is represented here. I just think we always need to remember that God is holy and is to be reverenced--even as our Best Friend. He is, after all, the Creator of the universe. Anyway, that being said, I loved the story itself, and just the reminder that God has a plan for our lives, and His plan is the perfect one--we just need to give Him the pen.

I would call it chick lit with depth. Just Saturday I posted reviews of some of my favorite non-fiction authors, Eric and Leslie Ludy, and their book \"When God Writes Your Love Story\" was one of them. This book is such a compliment to the concepts the Ludys talk about. I loved watching the way it might play out if you actually gave God the pen to your life and let Him write your love story. Only in a very humorous fashion. Not only is the story wonderful and funny, but it will make you think.

She\u2019s been a bridesmaid nearly a dozen times, waved numerous couples off to sunny honeymoons, and shopped in more department stores for half-price fondue pots than she cares to remember. But shopping for one key component of these countless proposals hasn't been quite as productive\u2013a future husband. The man she thought she would marry cheated on her. The crush she has on her best friend Blake is at very best\u2026well, crushing. And speed dating has only churned out memorable horror stories.So when God shows up one day, in the flesh, and becomes a walking, talking part of her life, Jessie is skeptical. What will it take to convince her that the Almighty has a better plan than one she\u2019s already cooked up in her journals?

I didn't read all the reviews, but I should have, because the very last one on the first page talks about how this book shows how powerful God's plan is for us. Nope. Nope, nope, nope.First of all, I had no clue this was going to be so religious and devotional. Seriously...I was expecting a lighthearted beach read rom-com whatever. And then it turns out to be this weird, weird, weeeeeirrrrdddddd book. It makes more sense when I view it through the lens of a believer, but as a non-believer, boy did this book get weird. As an atheist, I didn't even realize how sincere this book was about its God message until about 60% of the way through the book and then I felt really stupid for not having realized earlier. I thought God was a gimmick character or something, but nope. And then how can I hate a book that is so sincere about such a topic?But still, I don't really know how to feel about this book. I felt like I got suckered into reading it almost, but I didn't hate it. Mostly I just feel tricked. In a good way (?) if that's possible, because it's not like a dirty trick, but more like admiring-- as in, wow somehow I ended up reading a religious romance novel. Is that possible? Amazing.Also, I hated the main character. Seriously hated her. And no wonder. Without her, we wouldn't understand how great God's love is. So this is definitely not a traditional sort of chick-lit book. If only I had read the genre descriptions first. Christian Fiction. First genre suggested. I'm an idiot.

Jessie Stone is 35 and wants to be married. We start the book by joining her at a speed dating session. Speed dating in this book involved speaking to a member of the opposite sex for 8 minutes before moving on to the next one. At the end of the night, each left contact info with the manager, along with the names of the people they wanted to get to know better. None of the guys picked her. Jessie is a control freak and is stuck in a job she hates. She also keeps a journal and over the years she has scripted hundreds of romantic proposals. She just wants someone to propose to her--but he has to be the RIGHT someone. Then one day God starts appearing to her, in the flesh--well almost in the flesh. She can see Him; no one else can. He tells her it is time to let go and let Him write the script. Based on what He says, she quits her job and starts a business scripting and producing romantic proposals for guys who just can't figure out how to make the moment special. Still, she wants a guy for her very own. When God tells her she isn't ready yet, she's insulted. Eventually though....I was expecting some light silly chick-lit with a little religion thrown in; but this book was highly religious. There was some light and silly, like Jessie telling her business partner sister that if they didn't drum up more business, she'd have to use Cover Girl makeup and Wal-Mart hair products, but somehow to me, having regular audible conversations with God takes it out of the silly category. Jessie is like a lot of us, she wants things on her terms, not on God's and in this book, she didn't get what she wanted until she did things His way.

Some things to about Jessie: 1) She's allergic to chocolate (but she eats it anyway even though her face gets puffy because it swells up! It cracked me up though how she kept bags of M&M's in her desk drawer and would snack on them..). 2)She's a hopeless romantic who has always dreamed of the perfect \"proposal\" and wedding. 3)She is always doodling/writing these proposals and other things in her journal using her \"purple pen\". 4)She's still searching for the \"one\".This book is very funny along with inspirational in my opinion. I didn't like it at first because it started off a little slow but I couldn't put it down towards the end because I wanted a \"Happily Ever After\". The reason this book is inspirational is because one day when Jessie is least expecting it, God actually shows up (in the flesh) and starts following Jessie around. Jessie finally realizes it is Him and starts asking why her perfect man hasn't come along and why can't she be happy like all her friends are that are getting married around her. Of course, if you are a spiritual person, we all know that God has a special plan for us all. And, in this book, you find that sometimes when God is hinting around and trying to make you see what is RIGHT in front of you, you sometimes miss it. Eventually though, in Jessie's case, she finally gets the bigger picture and you will love the ending :). There is so much more that I could say about this book, but if you are interested, you should definitely read it. I found it heartfelt, funny, and over all a good book."}, {"userName": "Holly (2 Kids and Tired)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/584266-holly-2-kids-and-tired", "userReview": "Whenever you read a book you go into it with preconceived ideas. Always. Whether it be from the cover, the blurb, a review or your own experiences, you always have some sort of expectation. It's great when those expectations are met and it's disappointing when they're not.Never the Bride is a fun novel, no doubt about it. It is laugh out loud funny in places. The premise is actually thought-provoking, rather than simply being light and fluffy. Jessie Stone has always wanted to be married, but too many dating horror stories have taken their toll. When God shows up, looking like a real man, Jessie isn't quite sure what to think. But, as she allows God into her life, interesting things happen and He shows her that He is the one who is in control, if she'll only let Him lead her.I enjoyed the explorations in the conversations Jessie has with God and I was surprised at some of the depth. I liked the thought that God is a person who loves us and knows us and wants what's best for us. Accepting Him and loving Him and accepting His love in return isn't always as easy as we think it is. Being an \"older\" bride when I married, in some ways I could relate to Jessie, although I was never fixated on marriage like she was. I did like Jessie, although some of her shenanigans were annoying. What disappointed me was who God turned out to be. The idea that as Jessie looked back in hindsight, she hadn't known that at certain times when she thought she was with God, she was actually with someone else. I didn't care for that part. I think it was too confusing and it could have been done differently.Still, the novel is entertaining and surprisingly not as light-hearted as I expected. An easy, entertaining Christian read."}, {"userName": "Joy Mukami", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45215321-joy-mukami", "userReview": "I loved this book a lot;it made me feel like it was me,constantly how i keep letting go and letting God then grabbing my pack of dreams again from God and getting frustrated again.its hilarious,and simple and interesting, and most of all i loved the very happy ending.Indeed,when God writes our love story, it turns out so beautiful!!"}], "description": "Eleven Bridesmaid Dresses Don\u2019t LieSince she was just a little girl, Jessie Stone dreamed up hundreds of marriage proposals, doodled the romantic ideas in her journal with her treasured purple pen, and fantasized about wedding dresses and falling in love.\u00a0She\u2019s been a bridesmaid nearly a dozen times, waved numerous couples off to sunny honeymoons, and shopped in more department stores for\u00a0half-price fondue pots\u00a0than she cares to remember.
