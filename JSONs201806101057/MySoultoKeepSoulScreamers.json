So I warned you, keep that in mind.Please hold me. I feel like somebody came in, grabbed me and swept me off my feet, made me feel warm on the inside while he whispered everything I wanted to hear into my ear and so much more, and then suddenly I'm being dropped on my ass, a bucket of ice water gets dumped over my head and to top it off, I get stabbed in the gut with a blunt knife, making my insides bleed and burn, while I watch the guy I want to grow old with make out with my arch enemy.Multiply that feeling by 634 and you are not even close to feeling what I'm feeling right now.It's not the most mature reaction to a book but I really feel like dying. I knew this train was going to derail sooner or later (thank you Jess) but, I kept thinking things just couldn't get any more worse while I was watching it fly past stations like \"I-would-never-hurt-you\", \"Saneville\", and \"FUBAR\". My smile fell a little bit each time one of those signs passed me by, until my face froze up in terror, when the damn thing finally stopped, blinking away my tears while I read the \"Nuclear Disaster Land\" sign in front of me. I vaguely remember slapping my palms on the window and letting out a gut-wrenching NOOOOOO, right before I collapsed and lost consciousness.I don't even know what to say about Nash. In my mind, I conjured up his image and I've been staring at him for the past half hour, and he's looking at me like he's expecting me to say something but there are just no words. He just... I know he's... And that he couldn't... But what he did was just.... I can't believe it... ..."}, {"userName": "Maggie \u2618 (Reader in Wonderland)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40477684-maggie-reader-in-wonderland", "userReview": "*2,3/5 stars* \n\u201cI got swirling eyes and the capacity to shatter windows with my bare voice. Tod got teleportation and invisibility. The supernatural world is so far from fair.\u201d\nWell, this series is just more and more disappointing. I really wanted to loved this after the promising first book, and it's not all gloom and doom, but I can't overlook the angsty teen-drama, the horrible love interest (I'm seriously starting to hate the name Nash now tbh.) and it just seems all flat to me. I quite like some of the characters - Tod, Kaylee, Emma - but I'm not loving any of them, I'm not invested in the story as I should've been after reading three books already. \n\u201cYou want me to go?\u201d Tod asked me, his back to his brother.Nash implored me silently to say yes. Tod waited patiently.\u201cNo,\u201d I said, looking right at Nash. He scowled, and his shoulders sagged.\u201cGood.\u201d Tod stood and kicked the rolling chair out of his way. \u201cI just checked on your friend in the straitjacket. But first\u2026\u201d The reaper swung before either of us realized what he intended to do.Tod\u2019s very solid fist slammed into Nash\u2019s jaw. Nash\u2019s head snapped back. He stumbled into the wall.\u201d\n <--- Tod, the Savior of this whole mess of a book. #Nash totally deserved that.One of the few things I like about these books are the mysteries. They are always captivating and keep me reading till the end. The plot is interesting enough and takes some unexpected twists and turns - But not in this book, mind you. I guessed that thing from the start, while Kaylee was entirely oblivious to it, stumbling in the dark. I may take back my statement of her cleverness from my previous review. On the other hand my biggest problem with the books are the characters. And great, well developed characters are one of the most - if not most - important things in a book for me. If I'm not able to love and connect to at least some of the characters, it's pretty much done deal for me.\n\u201cBecause you don\u2019t seem to understand that the world isn\u2019t yours to save. This isn\u2019t a game, Kaylee. You\u2019re not an undercover cop. You\u2019re just a little girl who\u2019s in way over her head, and I\u2019m not going to let you get yourself killed over some stupid hero complex.\u201d*****\u201cI said stop.\u201dHe frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? I\u2019m not using any Influence.\u201d\u201cI know. Just\u2026slow down.\u201dHe sat up and frowned while I tugged my shirt back into place. \u201cIf we go any slower, we\u2019ll be moving back in time. You\u2019ve been teasing me for months, Kaylee. Anyone else would already have walked away.\u201d\n <--- Nash, the Douchebag and crappy boyfriend.Let's take Nash. I neither liked him nor hated him in the two previous books. I thought that Tod would be a better choice, that Nash is a bit spoiled and self-centered, but now he definitely managed to make me hate him with the burning passion of a thousand suns. He acted horribly (and suspiciously) the whole book, especially toward Kaylee. I never really liked their relationship, but he never ever acted badly toward her. Well, until this book. He acted like a controlling douchebag and insulted her. He manipulated her. He lied to her. Kaylee was too much forgiving toward him. In her place I would be all but nice to him. >Mentally kicking Nash<\n\u201cNothing I didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d She crossed her arms beneath her breasts. \u201cWhat? You think Nash is perfect?\u201dMy pulse spiked and I thought about him Influencing his way up my shirt that morning. But Em didn\u2019t know about that. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Emma sighed and leaned with both elbows on the counter, watching through the glass as Doug unlocked his car. \u201cI\u2019m just saying guys only come in a couple of models, and Nash didn\u2019t exactly break the mold. So lay off my boyfriend until you\u2019re ready to take a closer look at yours.\u201d\n <--- Emma, the Voice of Reason.I will still read the following books, but I have given up any hopes that the series will improve or that Kaylee will leave Nash for good and be with Tod. Or at least that Nash - Selfish. Manipulative. Asshole. - will suffer an unfortunate demise. #SorryNot\n\u201cRegret couldn't fix what he's broken. Apologies couldn't bring back what he's lost. What we'd lost.\u201d\nOverall: Bloody frustrating mess. Recommended for a reader who doesn't mind tons of teen drama."}, {"userName": "Alex ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11057966-alex", "userReview": "BR with little Amy :DThe best installment of The Soul Screamers so far!!! Darker, sexier, scarier!More Netherworld, more Avari, more demon breath. I just wish there was a little more Tod!!!!I like Kaylee, she's an ok heroine.

His lies and betrayal will be difficult to forgive, I hope.Tod... *swoon*\nMy right foot snagged in the hem of Sophie\u2019s dress and one hand went automatically to my ear to protect my hearing, while the other flew out in front of me to keep my face from hitting the asphalt. But before my palm could hit the ground, someone hauled me to my feet, tearing the dress with a dul thread-popping sound. Tod pulled me back, pressing me into his own chest as the creature on our right drew himself up to a terrifying height. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d I cried as Tod backed us swiftly away from the beast whose grayish cheekbones were literally sharp enough to slice the flesh from his face.\nThis excerpt made my heart beat just a little bit faster.

Seriously I was fuming mad when I got to the end of this book. This is what I wrote as I finished the book:\"Dear Nash,You are lower than pond scum! Seriously - you suck! Some things should be unforgivable! I'm sure Kaylee will ultimately forgive you but I'm not sure how you can possibly redeem yourself in my eyes.\"Make sure you have book #4 on hand so you can begin it as soon as you finish this one. It was midnight when I finished but there was no way I was going to be able to sleep because I was so worked up by what was revealed at the end of this book. I had to get 1/3 of the way into the next book before I finally fell asleep. I think that is one of the things I like most about Rachel's writing - the emotions her books ellicit in me, I'm connected to the characters, I care about the characters, they seem so real to me.My Soul to Keep took on some dark & heavy subject matter. Addiction and everything that comes with it is not a warm and fuzzy topic. However My Soul to Keep was original, fast paced and very well written. I loved this addition to the Soul Screamer Series.Rating: 5 Stars - I Loved It simply for the amount of emotion I felt while reading it.Content: everything was a step up from the last book - more language, more wandering hands, more innuendo, etc.Source: Audible.com Download"}, {"userName": "Jaime (Two Chicks on Books)", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3722438-jaime-two-chicks-on-books", "userReview": "Ok so after reading this book I am completely in love with Tod his character becomes much more human in it.

I think that had I not known what was going to occur in this book before reading it, I wouldn't have picked up on all of the un-Nash-like behaviour to the extent that I did and had I not known what was going to occur beforehand, I don't think I would have put together all of the subtle clues/ guessed how this book was going to turn out. I think that knowing what was going to happen allowed me to accept, \"Yes, this is going to happen and it is something that I just have to get used to\", whereas had I now known, it would have come as such a surprise to me and I think that I would have had a very difficult time accepting how it unfolded...That being said, this is hands down the best book in this series...As I have said, I am not a Nash fan and it may sound kind of heartless, but I did like seeing him being knocked down a few notches in this book. I felt like seeing a more vulnerable side of him made him seem more human (Er human? Right, he isn't human. Ummm... More nice bean sidhe who I can relate to and actually tolerate?). And surprise, surprise! I actually found myself experiencing other emotions besides hate and loathing towards him, I found myself sympathizing and feeling bad for him in certain instances, for instance in the case that he wasn't the route cause of the addiction. In \"My Soul to Save\" he was totally against helping Addy and Tod and only went along with the crazy plan because of Kaylee, and for that, the initial addiction was not his fault. What was his fault was how he dealt with the knowledge that he was addicted afterwards and I don't feel any sympathy for him in that regard whatsoever (those darn hating and loathing feelings emerge once again). He was the one who went to the Netherworld in order to get a fix, he was the one who gave up his memories of Kaylee, knowing that it would break her heart, and he was the one who allowed those he cared about to be possessed, all the while knowing that his mom is the master of Netherworld cures who could helped him overcome his addiction right from the start.Though Tod was more so at fault for the death of Doug and the downfall of Scott, than any other character besides Avari, I didn't find myself feeling any animosity towards him. In Nash's actions he was only thinking about himself, in Tod's actions he was thinking about Addy, and how he could lessen her pain and suffering in the Netherworld and that was something that I can respect and accept. I thought that it was also really nice to see Emma grow as a character in this book- I now find her to be much more than the blond friend who she was in the beginning of the series, the friend who was pretty oblivious to everything that was happening around her, only being concerned with what clothes she could steal from her older sisters. Also, I found myself feeling extreme sympathy/ pity for Sophie (even though she would probably hate my pity and bitch me out for it). That poor girl has just had a hard time, she really needs a break. First she loses a member of her dance team, then she dies, but comes back because her mom dies, she knows that her dad, uncle and cousin are keeping something from her, her boyfriend becomes an addict, is a huge jerk, and eventually ends up in a mental ward. So yeah, she deserves a shopping spree or something along those lines in the next book to make her feel better...As for Kaylee? Well props to her for not just accepting the fact that her boyfriend is a complete user- both in using drugs and in using her and their memories together to further his own ends, and props to her for not forgiving him right away like some girls may have (just for the fact that he is Nash Hudson and he is such a catch! UGH!). I think that this experience even though it was quite horrific, will only strengthen Kaylee, making her an even more kick-ass female character."}, {"userName": "Kristi-The Book Faery", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4387706-kristi-the-book-faery", "userReview": "First Impressions: When I finished My Soul to Keep, the third installment in the Soul Screamers series, I realized that I had hardly moved for the last half of the book! I also realized that Rachel not only created a brilliant piece of dark fiction but she also touched on many real issues that teens/adult\u2019s face in today\u2019s world. My Reflections: Kaylee has been through more than her fair share of horror. Born a Bean Sidhe, motherless and with an absentee father she\u2019s had to survive being institutionalized, taking trips into the Netherworld and fighting off evil relatives bartering for her soul\u2014among other things. But, she has Nash, her gorgeous boyfriend to even things out. He understands\u2014he\u2019s a Bean Sidhe, too, and he\u2019s always been there for her.My Soul to Keep starts with Kaylee and Nash at a party where a classmate is using Demon\u2019s Breath. It\u2019s deadly and from the Netherworld and Kaylee is going to find out just how this dangerous substance ended up in the hands of kids at her school. What Kaylee finds out is shocking and puts her life and those she loves in grave danger. I felt every emotion that Kaylee felt throughout the book. Betrayal, shock, hurt, fear\u2026 All those emotions are so cleverly written into the story. The ending was fierce although I expected nothing less from Kaylee; she\u2019s a strong independent young woman and has really grown into her character. Touching on issues such as drug abuse and all that goes with it could really hit home for a lot of readers. Rachel Vincent cleverly puts all the signs of abuse in the text and although this is fiction, it sends a strong positive message out.The next in the series, My Soul to Steal is guaranteed to be another page turner."}, {"userName": "Asia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19555546-asia", "userReview": "3.5 starsReading this book was like watching some paranormal telenovela.

However, I was still frustrated with both the main character and the general plot until the halfway point.Vincent showed shades of Richelle Mead by liberally bashing me over the head with clue-by-fours. By the second chapter, I\u2019d already developed strong suspicions about who might be involved in the Netherworld drug scheme (yes, all of those suspicions came true). Constantly foreshadowing plot twists through the repetition of significant words, Vincent prevented me from experiencing the shock and dismay I was no doubt meant to feel. In addition, I wanted to smack Kaylee and force her to see what was right in front of her. (I briefly considered the book\u2019s YA status as a reason for such blatant hints, but dismissed the idea since that wouldn\u2019t be giving teen readers much credit.) Lessons in subtlety would not go amiss for this writer. That\u2019s not to say all the surprises were ruined. There were some involving Tod in particular which added intrigue and offered a great deal of insight into the true character of my darling young bad boy. And yes, he is indeed darling. From the very beginning, I\u2019ve had a soft spot for Tod. His snark and his mischievous tendencies make him a wonderful foil for the habitually serious Kaylee and Nash. Though Tod prefers to do things his own way, he is not the selfish or unthinking person Nash claims him to be. Instead, Tod is there for those who need him. He\u2019s dependable and in this book he shone. Nash on the other hand\u2026From his first appearance, there was something about Nash that rubbed me the wrong way. He continued to irk me in this book, to the point where I wanted Kaylee to give him hell. I suppose many teens are reluctant to express displeasure in their first real relationship, but having never been that way, I found it hard to relate!As in the previous books, the kids save the day without the aid of their parents. However, in a moment I found rather hard to believe, this time there was an adult who knew what they were planning and made no move to stop them. Completely out of character for any responsible parental figure. There was also a lot of the Blame Game being played. Not only were adults and children alike blaming themselves for things they had no power over, several also blamed their own personal failures and worries on someone else. It happened often enough to be noticeable and lessened my opinion of certain characters.The second half of the book was far more exciting. More action, more information flowing, more emotion on display. Unlike in the previous books, Kaylee the newbie did not magically have all the answers. She had to piece things together as she went along and rely on the knowledge of the boys to fill in any gaps. Little Miss Know-it-all was banished, thank goodness. A trip to the Netherworld uncovered potential dangers, different species of fae, and a new character whom I hope we\u2019ll learn more about in future installments--his backstory and potential wealth of knowledge could be fascinating if handled properly. Kaylee became more take-charge and sensible as she finally listened to her intuition. She stood her ground in an incredibly trying situation, impressing me with her maturity and strong sense of self. The potential for the Soul Screamers series is evident. Vincent is obviously imaginative, she has a good handle on the teen perspective, and she\u2019s capable of conveying believable emotional turmoil. My wish is that she picks up the pace earlier next time around. I also hope Kaylee, Nash and Emma break even further away from the Typical Teen mold (they often come a little too close to embodying the everyteen in their reactions). Most of all, I want Tod to have more page time since he\u2019s easily the most dynamic, entertaining character on the Soul Screamers roster. I will definitely continue with the series, but as of now Vincent needs to step up her game to keep me engaged for the duration."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2276205-kelly", "userReview": "My Soul to Keep deals with the issue of drug abuse, but if you're worried it will be a preachy Very Special Episode type of story, worry no more. Rachel Vincent raises the book above that level -- both by allowing the damage to strike very close to home for Kaylee and by placing the issue in an enthralling plot -- so that it never feels like a simplistic \"drugs are bad, mmmkay\" fable.In My Soul to Save, Vincent introduced readers to Demon's Breath, a sought-after intoxicant among the denizens of the Netherworld. Kaylee now emerges from her month-long grounding to find that someone has brought Demon's Breath to her high school and that several of her acquaintances are using it. And for human kids, using Demon's Breath is a nearly inevitable ticket to insanity or death. Then, Vincent makes terrific use of a tiny, forgettable detail from book two and puts Kaylee through a wrenching betrayal. Now she has to deal with the repercussions of that betrayal while thwarting a hellion's sinister designs.The human (and bean sidhe) characters have believable shades of gray that inspire compassion even when their behavior is reprehensible. For example, one Demon's Breath user became addicted by accident; that initial event was not his fault at all. Yet he is still morally culpable for what he did after that to feed the addiction. As for the hellion, he's horrifying; My Soul to Keep features so many chilling ways a hellion can destroy lives and relationships.Kaylee shows admirable strength at the novel's end; I'm reminded of Albus Dumbledore's words about the courage it takes to stand up to one's friends. I am so tired of wilting heroines and it's so gratifying to see one who calls people on their bad behavior and stands up for her own needs.This ending leaves the Soul Screamers series in an uncertain place -- but at the same time it's blown wide open, with so many interesting directions Vincent could take it. I had been slightly disappointed in My Soul to Save and unsure whether to continue -- but after My Soul to Keep, I'm eagerly along for the ride."}, {"userName": "Kristy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2705039-kristy", "userReview": "So far this has been my least favorite of the \"Soul screamers\" books....For some reason I just couldn't get into the beginning.

Kaylee got on my nerves just a bit though... I did stick it out though. And, I have to say I ended up enjoying the late middle/end. I love Tod even more now than ever.

I wish he'd been left behind instead of Addie by the end. Seriously. I didn't like her in book 2 but I really disliked Nash here.

She seemed like she would there for a minute and I hated the idea of her just giving in to him. I really like Alec for his part in the serious. He and Emma sort of lighten things up in some moments.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADNumero Uno! What the actual Hell was Nash thinking? I mean, really?! Really?!! You know how dangerous this stuff is! You know what it can do to you! You are seeing what it is doing to your friends\u2026as you use it! You, my dear bean sidhe, are an idiot of Netherworld proportions. IDIOT! Why on earth would Kaylee forgive you? You used her! You let a hellion use her body to sell you Netherdrugs. What is wrong with you???? And then you want forgiveness. She had better not. She really better not. She needs to ride off into the sunset with Tod and be done with you! How could you violate her like that? Tod should kick your ass from this world to the Netherworld and back! Asshole!Now that that\u2019s done, Kaylee, what were you thinking? Why would you wait so long to involve Harmony and Brenden and Aiden in this? Seriously. Emma called you on it. Nash was never perfect. Of course, who would have thought he would go over the deep end and decide to take Netherdrugs? Not me. Still, you should have at least given them to Tod at the first sight of Nash\u2019s use, and there were clues, Kaylee. The story itself wasn\u2019t as suspenseful as the previous two and I think that has something to do with the lack of urgency, at least up until the very end. There were limited people using the Demon\u2019s Breath, so for the time, even if Kaylee couldn\u2019t come to the rescue, it was still only two people, which is sad, but not tragic. I would\u2019ve liked the story more if we\u2019d known all along that Avari was planning to open a giant portal to Hell through the school doors. At least then I would have cared. Personally, the lives of Scott and Doug just didn\u2019t matter to me. As usual, this story was character driven. I cared about what happened to Nash and Tod and Kaylee and Tod and Emma but mostly Tod, and I cared about their outcomes. I want my Taylee ship to sail so badly. They are so close.

I don't want to rant unreasonably but..The idea of banshees is wonderful and unique, but when you stick it in a high school and have underlying everyday high school problems with a paranormal twist...it just loses the charm. Anyone know of other book series on banshees?The adults here are badly written. First, the right thing is done because the adults are actually clued into the banshee business and everything; in fact they ARE banshees too. It's a genetic thing. The problem falls when at every turn of events the main character (wait what's her name again?) is in some dire circumstance (as happens in most climaxes) and she repeatedly refuses to call her dad, or clue in her uncle. Anything. Anybody. Why? Because she is afraid of getting grounded. You know, I really don't have to keep going on that subject. It's ridiculous.And one last small thing. The protag's cousin Sophie, aka Ice Bitch Queen Character....yeah she's freakin 15 years old. Think of that. I can't even imagine being mollified by a fifteen year old. And I hope I'm using that word right, because I don't want to be sounding like a fifteen year old.But REALLY, I get that the protag is only barely 17 or something, but that just makes me roll my eyes.Okay rant over. I'm disappointed. I really wanted to like this series, and I figured three books were enough to judge a seven book series.Oh. Don't get me wrong, there were aspects I liked about these books. Tod the reaper. Netherworld-building. Wait.Yeah that's it.The first two books were bearable.

(Can you tell by my adding an extra exclamation point?)Kaylee and Nash have now been dating for awhile, and things seem to be going relatively well in regards to their relationship and life in general. That is, until the two realize that several of the guys they know have been using Demon's Breath, a strong narcotic for those with non-human blood, but deadly to those who actually are human. So in this installment of the series, Kaylee and Nash work together (along with our good friend, Tod the Reaper) to get rid of the drug, and hopefully save their friends in the process.So, as I said before, this series has gotten pretty intense for me! I actually am liking the direction this book went in, by giving Kaylee and Nash's relationship a more realistic turn, and allowing for actual conflict. (I enjoy sunny relationships, but there's something about this one that has me actually preferring it not to be.) I'm still liking Kaylee. Still thinking Nash is a bit of a tool. And still loving Tod, cause even with how things turned out for him in the second book, he continues to be his funny and 'nuisance to Nash', self. Oh, and Kaylee's best friend Emma is still her wonderfully, understanding self. Maybe too understanding at times, cause I would really get upset if I was constantly being told nothing, when it's obvious that something is going on, but her trusting Kaylee has her mostly accepting what she is told. (I'm not saying she's a pushover, cause she's not. She's just that good of a friend.)I'm still really enjoying this series, so it's on to the next for me."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2850786-jennifer", "userReview": "The Good: Tod is becoming a much more compelling character. He seems to be growing into his role and becoming a better person, in sharp contrast to his brother. I really enjoyed the Demon's Breath/drug angle of the book and how that played out with involving the students at Kaylee's school.The Bad: Kaylee conveniently forgets crucial details on a regular basis. It drags the books out, ridiculous when they're so short as it is. Any reader even halfway paying attention will completely remember these things and grow increasingly frustrated throughout the book. And then there's the whole boyfriend hiding things from her. Unforgivable things. Add that to the fact that the characters continue to hide everything possible from the adults in their lives for no good reason other than \"parents just don't understand.\" Except, these parents would completely understand and help. Yet, let's just screw ourselves over and go completely unprepared into mortal danger time and again because parents are dumb or whatever. Maybe this thing resonates with teen readers, but as an adult with the ability to judge the parents on their previous reactions to situations in the series, these kids are coming off as complete idiots begging to be killed."}, {"userName": "Jac", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3824750-jac", "userReview": "I think this was the most disappointing book so far in the series. Tod is rapidly becoming my favorite character but there was so little of him in this book. Once he came back into play, I wanted to keep reading simply because he was involved. Nash's character really disturbed me because in this book compared to the others he had a completely different personality. To me it was almost like she was writing about another character entirely just with Nash's body. I realize that was her intention but it was seriously off putting from the very beginning. Also, the issue in this book seemed too \"real-world\" for a paranormal fantasy which really irked me. A deadly drug running rampant throughout a public high school. <Nevertheless, I did enjoy the book once it picked up (about 2/3 in) so I still plan to read the sequel when it is released. I do enjoy Vincent's work I just hope she returns to why I enjoyed this series to begin with.

Kaylee Cavanaugh is just your everyday high school student, except she was a bean sidhe (banshee). Along with her boyfriend Nash, who is also a bean sidhe, and his brother Tod, the reaper, Kaylee is coming to grips with her powers and her tie to the Netherworld.First LineThe whole thing started with a wasted Jock and a totaled car\u2026\u2026 My SynopsisKaylee Cavanaugh first night out, after being grounded for a month, ended with a real bang. She was hanging out at a party with her bean boyfriend, Nash Hudson and the rest of the \u2018shining throng\u2019, better known as the popular kids. When one of Nash\u2019s teammates and her best friends love interest, Doug Fuller, hit Kaylee\u2019s car. Doug was under the influence, but it isn\u2019t what you probably think. The jocks of Kaylee\u2019s high school are taking a substance called Frost, better known in the Netherworld as Demon\u2019s Breath. It is highly addictive substance, that can kill humans or maybe worse drive them insane. No matter how hard Kaylee tries to stay out of the Netherworld and it\u2019s problems, they just keep finding her, With the help of Nash, Tod, and a cast of unlikely characters, Kaylee has to figure where the Demon\u2019s Breath is coming from, and who is bring it from the Netherworld to her world before it\u2019s to late. Kaylee has to proceed carefully, or she may lose something that she holds very dear.My ReviewI first want to applaud Rachel Vincent, for taking on issues that are very real to today\u2019s teens. This book deals not only with drug use, but addiction and it consequences. It also deals with the pressure on teens to have sex. These issues may be wrapped up in the world of ban sidhe\u2019s, but this situation could happen in any high school in America. Also, the teens is in series sound and react like real teens, not how an adult might thinks a teen would sound and react.I enjoyed reading about how Kaylee is dealing with her relationship with Nash through out the beginning of the book. She\u2019s questioning how he really feels about her. Are they soul mates? I mean forever is a long time when you are a bean sidhe. She\u2019s questioning how far they should take their relationship physically. She\u2019s also feeling the first stirrings of jealousy. I remember going through these same issues as a teen, and I can really relate to her character.For me the stand out character from this book is Tod. He really steps up in this book. He does what has to be done, even risking the love of his undead life, to help Kaylee. Though he isn\u2019t without his own faults (ie. crossing Nash over no questions asked and carrying unknown substances from the Netherworld to real world), but for methe reason behind the actions are solid. He\u2019s the like the big brother Kaylee never had, and he seems to have soft spot when if comes to her. He may, at first, come a crossed as somewhat obnoxious and self centered. I see this as more of a smoke screen. With each book, we get to see more and more of who he really is, and I really like it. I read the last chapter with my hand covering my mouth in complete and utter shock. All I wanted to do is cry for Kaylee. I just couldn\u2019t believe what Nash did, though the signs were all there. I guess, I just saw Nash as Kaylee\u2019s rock, the person she could always turn to for everything. That is probably why I didn\u2019t see it coming, and neither did Kaylee. My heart broke after reading what Nash had done, and how he had treated Kaylee. His actions had so many awful consequences. Will Kaylee, in time, come to forgive Nash for his appalling behavior? I just don\u2019t know, but I just hope that he can get himself together and be the man Kaylee deserves.The Soul Screamer books are getting better and better, with each book released.

Ma fortunatamente questo non \u00e8 il caso.La trama \u00e8 stata organizzata alla perfezione, rendendo il libro emozionante e mai scontato. I personaggi si evolvono, crescono e affrontano problemi concreti e tematiche sentimentali. Il mondo dei bean sidhe si evolve ed entrano a far parte nuove e misteriose creature, e un nuovo pericolo minaccia gli amici dei nostri protagonisti.Ho apprezzato lo sviluppo della storyline in un arco temporale molto pi\u00f9 ampio, dando cos\u00ec modo ai personaggi di avere un ampio spazio per essere analizzati.Kaylee, anche se a mio avviso soffre della sindrome del buon samaritano (indispensabile ai fini dello sviluppo di una serie di romanzi cosi lunga), riesce ad integrarsi nel mondo magico di cui fa parte, capire le dinamiche che lo muovono, e riuscire anche a sfruttarle a suo vantaggio.Nash, di cui ho avuto una strana sensazione dall'inizio del libro, \u00e8 stato protagonista di comportamenti al quanto discutibili. Nei libri precedenti si era sempre comportato come il ragazzo perfetto, dolce disponibile e sempre presente e pronto a proteggere kaylee quindi potete immaginare come mi sia dispiaciuto leggere della sua d\u00e9bacle ma capisco che era inevitabile, sia ai fini della storia che dell'evoluzione della protagonista. Sono rimasta stupita e orgogliosa, invece, della scelta di Kaylee di non perdonarlo, nessuno al mondo dovrebbe, mai e poi mai, essere considerato da un'altra persona con cos\u00ec poco rispetto e fiducia, e soprattutto mai dovrebbe essere usato. Ancora una volta la Rachel conclude il libro facendo in modo che i suoi personaggi comprendano una lezione, ed \u00e8 bello che questo genere di libro porti con se un insegnamento morale, cosa che non accade spesso con i romanzi YA.I personaggi secondari hanno la loro possibilit\u00e0 di farsi conoscere di pi\u00f9 dal lettore, Emma e Tod sono molto simpatici e particolari. Tod in particolare lo trovo un personaggio molto umano, capace di vivere di sentimenti puri, anche considerata la sua posizione di reaper, dimostrando al lettore che per amore si \u00e8 pronti a far sacrifici che in altri casi non penseremmo neanche due volte di fare. Inoltre \u00e8 dolce leggere di come questi sia capace di essere presente per Kaylee nel momento del bisogno, a differenza del fratello.La storia che si intreccia in questo terzo volume \u00e8 accattivante in modo particolare, l'introduzione di nuovi personaggi del mondo magico, l'evoluzione e il cambiamento di alcuni personaggi fanno in modo che il libro si apra a nuove possibilit\u00e0, lasciando il lettore piacevolmente stupito all'evolversi degli avvenimenti.Lo stile della Rachel \u00e8 sempre molto emozionante, ti immerge completamente all'interno della lettura portandoti a finire il libro in poco tempo.4 Stelle"}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7233968-chelsea", "userReview": "Never exactly a light series, Soul Screamers takes a notably dark turn in this book. After a party that gets out of hand, Kaylee begins to suspect that some of her classmates are using demon's breath--a Netherworld substance with hallucinogenic properties. She and Nash set out to cut off the source of the drug before things turn deadly.First of all, I have to applaud Vincent for attempting to tackle as difficult a topic as addiction. What I have admired about this series most thus far is that she manages to address real problems common to many teenagers, but does so through fantasy elements. From parents and school, to the will-they-or-won't-they aspect of Nash and Kaylee's physical relationship, these character read like real teenagers. In this particular book the addiction is used to illuminate many of the character's flaws, fears, and inner demons. There was a great deal of character development and many emotional moments.Vincent continues to build the paranormal aspects of her world, hinting at more interesting facets and possible future plot threads all the time. While this takes a back seat in many cases to the internal struggles, it's still fairly well done and worth noting.Kaylee is left on he own or with very limited help many times throughout this book, and in many cases that seemed needless. I questioned many times why she did not find someone stronger or more knowledgeable than herself to help. I'm continuously bothered by the apparent lack of competent adult policing/fighting forces in this little supernatural world. One would assume that if there are a decent number of banshees and other creatures, there should be some kind of leader, or a warrior class, anyone at all that could step in when someone evil threatens multiple lives. Or it could all be left up to a teenage girl...that seems fine too.My other major complaint is the utter lack of resolution in the ending. BIG SPOILER ALERT:One of two things needed to happen in this ending: either Kaylee needed to leave Nash for good because of all of the crap he did to her, or she needed to forgive him and try to start over. She half-asses it instead, saying she wants him to get better so she can have him back. In a long established relationship, that would make sense: I would be able to believe that she loved him and that their relationship could sustain temporary separation for the purpose of mental healing. However, their relationship is fairly new--three months I believe. Realistically, even if they felt in love, taking a break at this point would mean the end because the relationship is not established enough to survive it. So yes, I hated the ending and I felt it was a massive cop out on the authors part.These complaints aside, this was a good book overall. It had a lot of depth and emotion without needless angst. 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Chibineko", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4436152-chibineko", "userReview": "If you haven't read any of Rachel Vincent's SoulScreamers series, then you are seriously missing out. Young & old alike can find a lot to enjoy in this series. For the adults, there's well written plot lines, great characters & for the younger readers there's just as much to love. They get to enjoy all of the stuff that the adults would like but they also have the joy of knowing that at no point does this book \"write down\" to them. As a teen I'd often get irritated at the overly perfect characters & the preachy morals that many authors tried to insert into their work. (The good girls never drank or stayed out late, always studied...) Vincent tries hard to avoid those cliches & worn out ideas in her series- and succeeds.Kaylee's had it rough. Not only has she spent most of her life assuming that there's something wrong with her, but even after she discovered her bean sidhe heritage it hasn't been easy. She's had to fight demons, save people from death- or worse, & put up with her bratty cousin. Kaylee's just hoping that she'll finally get some time to relax with her hunky boyfriend & be as normal as she possibly can be. Unfortunately for her, someone's smuggling Demon's Breath into the mortal world- a substance so incredibly addicting that coming down from it can kill you. It's up to her to find out a way to stop the distribution of it before her entire school becomes addicted.Once again Vincent manages to write a fantastic & fast paced read. Kaylee manages to remain an intriguing & sympathetic character that many teens will find themselves relating to. Also interesting is the character of Nash, Kaylee's boyfriend who may or may not be more in love with the fact she's a bean sidhe than with Kaylee herself. He goes through a lot of character development in this book, which is a good thing- he needs to prove himself to the audience & to Kaylee.There's also new characters introduced in this book, one of which will hopefully turn into a new suitor for Kaylee. (Hey, Nash needs competition.) Teens will love the pacing of the book & parents will love that the book deals with sensitive subjects like drug addiction & sex (Nash wants it now, Kaylee wants to wait) in a way that won't alienate anyone or go over the top.This is a great entry into a series that has been strong from the start & looks like it will be going strong for quite some time. If you haven't been reading the series, I highly suggest that you start from the first book in the series as well as reading the free \"chapter zero\" available on Vincent's site.(ARC provided by NetGalley)"}, {"userName": "Donna {Book Passion for Life}", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3024878-donna-book-passion-for-life", "userReview": "Wow, what a ride My Soul to Keep was. After reading My Soul to Save I was a little bit disappointed that is wasn't as good book one but Rachel Vincent is definitely back.In this instalment we see Kaylee go through a whole new challenge. When her friends at school get a hold of the deadly Demon's Breath, they soon start becoming addicts and of course Kaylee takes it upon herself to try and sort out the problem. With the help of Nash and Tod, Kaylee battles through the Neverworld yet again but when she finds out the person closet to her is also an addict.....Kaylee's world is turned upside down and now it becomes a battle to save the one she loves most.My Soul to Keep was a perfect example of why I enjoy Rachel Vincent\u2019s work. It was thrilling, dangerous and FULL of emotions and I loved every minute it. It's safe to say I definitely felt more connected with this novel than book two. I feel the reason for this is because this time around, the danger is surrounding Kaylee\u2019s close friends and loved ones rather than someone we didn't really know and I loved it all the more. Kaylee this time around, I felt grew as a character and she truly stands up for what she believes in. It is sad to say that this time, her journey is a sad one because she is trying to save Nash who is addicted to Demon's Breath and that opens up a can of worms for their relationship. Kaylee feels betrayed because Nash doesn't confide in her about his problem and there are things that she just can't get over, so they do break up. I can totally understand why she feels like this but I couldn't help feel sorry for Nash. It's not his fault he was exposed to Demon's Breath, it was just his fault he hid it and lied about it. My heart honestly broke for him, I love Nash...honestly love him and I seriously hope he gets back to his normal self and him and Kaylee work on their problems.Despite all the sadness in this book, it was good to see Tod interact more with Kaylee. I've already heard of a potential storyline that might happen between them and I'm not sure how I feel about it at the moment but for now, I did enjoy getting to know him better and I loved how he supported Kaylee.

In the previous two books, Kaylee and Nash met, fell in love and realised the lengths they would go to prove their love for each other. Without giving away the plot, My Soul to Keep is a whole different matter as Nash fundamentally betrays Kaylee and her character is tested to the limit as she must overcome her shock and pain to push forward nevertheless and save the lives of Nash and her father.My Soul to Keep starts with Kaylee and Nash at a party where a classmate is using Demon\u2019s Breath. It\u2019s deadly and highly addictive and of course, it's from the Netherworld; Kaylee is going to find out just how this dangerous substance ended up in the hands of kids at her school. What Kaylee finds out is shocking and puts her life and those she loves in grave danger. As with all the books in the series, the best character in the book is Tod and I cannot wait to see more of him. I felt every emotion that Kaylee felt throughout the book. Betrayal, shock, hurt, fear\u2026 All those emotions are so cleverly written into the story along with a strong sense of being there. The ending was fierce although I expected nothing less from Kaylee; she\u2019s a strong independent young woman and has really grown into her character.  Rachel Vincent has a terrific style of writing, and is able to convey humour, sarcasm and descriptions effortlessly, without weighing down the flow of the story.

It takes place a month after the last book and it is full of action and intense emotion. Rachel has a way of making Kaylee's experiences mirror the experiences of what may happen to a typical teen. The Netherworld has opened up the door to things Kaylee never knew were possible, and this book proves just that. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that I am thrilled that the boyfriend (Nash) is not perfect. Every relationship has issues. This story brings back some characters that I didn't expect to see again. I was thrilled that the story focused more on Kaylee's school. I wanted the chance to get to know some new characters see how she deals with high school issues.This book delves deeper into Kaylee's new home life as well. The development of each character was amazing. I really felt like I knew each of them better after this story. One of the biggest examples of that was with Tod. I think I mentioned in my mini-review of My Soul to Save that Tod was really brought onto a new level in that book. This book emphasizes that even more! Gotta love Tod :)The smaller intimate parts of this book were my favorite. The interactions between each character were amazingly written. Each small detail carried such significance. As I was reading it I felt that each fight, each touch, or each look carried a lot more meaning than in most stories. I enjoyed those parts even more than the action.Very emotional, very shocking, and sometimes very heartbreaking, this story shakes Kaylee's world.

My Soul to Keep  certainly is the best installment of the series so far. It\u00b4s darker, scarier, deeper and full of mystery and heart break. Perfect October read.

The guy is always there to help them, even though he\u00b4s putting his life (death?) on a line. Still, every time something goes wrong he\u00b4s the first to blame. While for others means justify actions and certain behavior born from love or concern are considered romantic and selfless, same situations do not apply for him. Instead, he\u00b4s left regarded as reckless and dangerous. I\u00b4d appreciate some more gratitude and general friendliness for his constant help.

It combines the average drug problem youth is confronted with with the Netherwordly danger and craziness. I\u00b4m glad the plot took a turn out of happy peppy rainbow world and Kaylee\u00b4s perfect relationship gets seriously bumped up, because - surprise - the guy messed up. Big time, this time.
