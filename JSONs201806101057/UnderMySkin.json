I won't post spoilers but will give you a summary of my thoughts as I read the book. After the funeral of her husband, Poppy runs away...somewhere, she can not remember. She has lost those two days of her frenzied grief and now it is imperative that she remember where she was and what she did. Poppy thinks she is being followed by a mysterious man wearing a dark hoodie. Detective Grayson doesn't seem to be of much help in solving the brutal murder of her husband, Jack, but does he suspect Poppy could have been involved? Poppy's best friend since childhood urges her to come stay with her family and Layla wants an accounting of Poppy's whereabouts each day. It is frustrating for Poppy, but, also may be necessary since Poppy showed up a hysterical wreck at Layla's home after her loss of time. So as the story progresses the reader wonders if Layla knows more about Jacks death, or is she just trying to be a good friend.Poppy is experiencing vivid night terrors and recently she has started episodes of hypnagogic hallucinations during the day while she is awake. The scenes are very real and she is having trouble decerning real time from the hypnagogia. Poppy cannot sleep and is getting through each day with the help of her prescription from Dr. Nash and a secret stash of pills Layla gives her to take.The various possibilities of what happened to Jack and why are many. There are many mysterious characters in this story and they will keep you guessing! Some of the scenes are repeated and the time sequence changes from past to present and from real to hallucination are often. That can be a bit confusing. I don't think I would want to listen to audio due to that, but reading through the book it is clearer about the timelines."}, {"userName": "Reading", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3564223-reading", "userReview": "This story is a mess. Written in first person, I couldn\u2019t tell when the story was hallucination, flashback, present, or even wondering if it was a preview of something happening in the future. I\u2019ve never been so confused in a story. The sad thing is that the bones of the story are great. Was Poppy\u2019s husband\u2019s death a random act of violence or was it a part of a brutal conspiracy?I would love to see a complete rewrite so that the story of a grieving widow hunting for the solution to this mystery could be read with pleasure instead of constantly going back in the story to see just what the heck is happening."}, {"userName": "Stephanie ", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1007476-stephanie", "userReview": "I don\u2019t recall reading much of Lisa Unger\u2019s work, but I am somewhat of a sucker for the plucky heroine in danger genre, so I was happy to get a copy of Under My Skin from Harlequin-Hanover Square Press and NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.I did read this book pretty much in one day, so I was able to keep on track in terms of the plot line, but I wonder if I had been reading a bit at a time over a span of several days (or more) if I might have gotten lost in the story.The plucky heroine is Poppy, whose beloved husband Jack was murdered while on an early morning run, which Poppy elected to sleep through. The event was so traumatic for her that she had a breakdown and doesn\u2019t remember anything about a stretch of time. She only knows she was found by her uber-wealthy friend Layla and was hospitalized.The story includes both the reality of Poppy\u2019s life (about a year after the breakdown as she tries to regain the missing time) and her dreams/memories/imagination. Poppy is desperate to get it together: when she looks in the mirror she sees \u201c\u2026a tired, wrung-out version of the person she used to be.\u201dPoppy and Jack were both photographers who had successfully traveled the world before they settled down and started an agency (also successful), but it\u2019s a bit unclear whether they both were completely happy. And Poppy knows that \u201cEveryone wants you to think their relationship is perfect. But nothing\u2019s perfect, no matter what they post on Facebook.\u201d And Poppy\u2019s view of the world is that of a photographer: \u201cOur faces, our body language, the changing light of a room, every second is different than the one before or after The photographer chooses one among the infinite. It\u2019s both a lie, a trick of light, and an irrefutable truth.\u201dI loved the writing and the use of language. I am not good at solving the mystery in a book \u2013 generally, I get an \u201caha!\u201d at the end rather than figuring it out, so it isn\u2019t a surprise that I didn\u2019t figure this one out\u2014also, there were several red herrings and plot twists which were good. Personally, I viewed Poppy\u2019s uncertainty about the reliability of her memories/hallucinations as a normal result of the tons of pills she was washing down with alcohol, and thought she was an addict who needed to get straight if she really wanted to get it together.I had some mixed feelings about the end, but can\u2019t see how another resolution might have worked. I liked it, and it entertained me and made me feel and think, which all adds up to four stars."}, {"userName": "Glady", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32876648-glady", "userReview": "I received a free ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.Under My Skin is an overly long, somewhat repetitive mystery that really can't decide what it is. Ghost story? Murder mystery? Psychological drama? Family drama? Despite the redundancies, Unger manages to keep me reading. Poppy's husband, Jack, has been murdered and now, a year later, there is still no resolution to the crime. After his death, Poppy disappears for a few days and then reappears with no memory of those lost days. She has been unable to re-emerge into her own life since her grief is so overwhelming that she self-medicates with a variety of pills and alcohol. Occasional hookups with random men she meets via a dating site add to her confusion and despair.Supporting Poppy in these lonely sad days are Layla, her best friend from childhood, her mother, and Layla's family. Here is where the redundancy comes in. Yes, Poppy's mother was somewhat distant and she was closer to her now deceased father. Yes, Layla came from a violent family where her father abused both her mother and her. Yes, Layla was \"rescued\" by Poppy and her family. Yes, Layla is now married to a very successful workaholic. I got it the first time; I didn't need to read it over and over.Poppy's loss is so all-consuming that she questions every last conversation she had with her late husband. Her self-medication also sets her into almost a hypnotic state where she envisions her husband covered in blood warning her to back off. Other bloody visions and detailed conversations with friends and strangers (real or not) add to the uncertainty of Poppy's rational mind. All in all, Unger's novel isn't bad; it's just too repetitive."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7306509-janet", "userReview": "I received a DIGITAL Advance Reader Copy of this book from #NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

What an amazing book. I loved it. Intense Hypnagogia anyone? Lucid dreams while awake. I shuddered through most of this book, what a tragedy that happens to poor Poppy. Her husband is killed one morning while out for a run, after the funeral Poppy has an episode where she is gone for days and doesn't remember anything from that time. My second book this week with such an intense tragedy .....so bear with me. My heart poured out for poor Poppy. Can we just say train wreck? I mean you can see everything coming but to be inside this girls head while she figures it out is just horrifying and amazing at the same time. The author does such a good job putting you behind this girls eyes as she fights to determine what is real and just what is a dream. I was amazed at the writing. I wanted to reach out and strangle her friend Layla at some point when she helped her get more pills, when all she needed was clarity...not more sleep. I loved it.

Lisa Unger's story of Poppy, a woman whose husband was murdered, her subsequent breakdown and her resolution of events was visceral read. Admittedly it took a few chapters to get into the story; however once I did I was hooked and had to continue reading until the end. Weaving the narrative between Poppy's reality and her fragmented imagination, dreams and memories, Unger immerses the reader into the roller coaster that is Poppy's life. I could really feel Poppy - her confusion, elation, grief - and cheered her on, yelled at her to smarten up, rejoiced at her resolve and then became angry with her and the author. The end really upset me but maybe it was the author's way of saying that not all is as it seems, which is a bit of a theme in the story. In the end, the story roused emotion in me, and that for me is always a good read."}], "description": "From New York Times bestselling author and master of suspense Lisa Unger comes an addictive psychological thriller about a woman on the hunt for her husband's killer What if the nightmares are actually memories?It's been a year since Poppy's husband, Jack, was brutally murdered during his morning run through Manhattan's Riverside Park.
