Although this is my first book by this author, I can certainly say it won't be my last. It started slow, but it captured me from the beginning. The many varying facets of this novel enthralled and bewitched me. There're many points I loved, and far fewer I disliked. So, as always, let's start with my list of loves:-languages I don't know about you, but I've always been interested in learning languages. I'm partly fluent in Latin, less fluent (but still partially) in French, and working on Italian currently. Whew. Lydia knew around 8 (maybe more) languages. Personally, that was thrilling to read about. Brownie points. >.<-insta-loveSometimes I'm passive about 'love at first site'. But not normally. I enjoy romance, but not chic-lit. I was pleased with how the romance was handled. The hurdles they had to cross, that they annoyed one another, starting out as a platonic relationship... It was fresh (like bane ;) and enjoyable. -wittyI hope you enjoy books that make you laugh just as much as I do. Period romances usually aren't strong on this point, but Camden incorporated it adroitly. -slow salvation The salvation and beliefs of the main character were believable. It wasn't 'let me pray one prayer and now I'm a faith giant'. It was gradual and natural. -drug useI believe I would be correct in saying this is the first book I've read that deals directly with drugs for the main portion of the plot. Intriguing, to say the least. -consequences of drugsAfter becoming addicted to drugs, Lydia (toward the very end of the novel) goes through rehab and experiences pretty brutal withdrawals. She tracks the steps of rehab over the weeks and how she recovers, covering every harsh and painful detail. By the end, you're positive you want nothing to do with opium (to be clear, I didn't want anything to do with it before. Now it's just even more so). ;) -motives Bane (the protagonist/love interest) has a purpose. A clear and precise mission. The drive of the novel is clear, and it's excellently chosen. I especially love that Lydia recognizes Bane has such a strong purpose in life (to eradicate the lethal opium trade) and is almost disheartened, to a degree. When I look around in my life, I see friends of mine that have their entire life planned out, who know exactly how they want to live, and they have a clear purpose. Me? Well...not so clear. I could relate to Lydia, so that was nice. -ocdMost times when an author attempts to display a character with OCD, they wind up exhaustingly annoying. She used Lydia's 'disorder' to the advantage of the plot, and didn't make it stand out unbecomingly. Now that I've swooned, here's a few critiques: -Bane's perfection He had some rough spots he worked through in the way past, but he didn't have any character flaws. Although I will readily admit, he was adorable.-believability/plot-driven This wasn't really a major deal, but for a few things (I won't mention them due to spoilers) were too coincidental. I could believe most of it, but it went a little too far just a few times. So there it is! One of the few historical romances I've ranked as 5 stars!See the full review (with content overview) at Literary Cafe: http://literarycafe.weebly.com/home/a..."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18780551-anne", "userReview": "Boston, Massachusetts and Vermont, 1890'sIf you're in the mood for something different, try Against the Tide by Elizabeth Camden, and you won't be disappointed! This was my first novel by this author, and we're off to an excellent start because this was simply incredible!After a difficult and uncertain childhood, Lydia Pallas manages to land a job at the Boston Navy Yard as a translator, given her exceptional skill with languages. She is finally able to settle into a routine, and comes to love it so much (having a routine) that she becomes quite OCD. Books and dictionaries must be arranged just so  on her desk, ink bottles have their specific order, and she always orders the same food at the same place at the same time. Only one person ever dares to disrupt her order: the enigmatic, impossibly good-looking Lieutenant Alexander Banebridge, who takes wicked delight in fooling around with Lydia's things. For the longest time, that becomes a routine as well; Lydia works at her desk and Bane strolls in on his way to the Admiral's office, disturbs a few things without her noticing, but never talks to her. But one day, events start throwing them together, and quite suddenly, he's disturbing a lot more in Lydia's life than only her desk. Together they get caught up in a deep web of intrigue, danger and espionage in the terrible fight against opium, and will need to resort to great lengths and really give all they have to overcome the difficult struggles. Amidst all the suspense, a romance naturally develops between them, and I assure you no two persons have ever been more suited to each other than they are.Just when you think the story can't get any better, or any more suspenseful, it does, and surprises await at every turn. I was completely enthralled with this book! Lydia emerged from it all incredibly brave, selfless, and determined. She is undoubtedly the strongest heroine I've encountered this year, and was simply amazing. Bane also was a wonderful hero, and their story was simply extraordinary. The bond they shared was truly unequalled and resulted in a fierce, passionate love as is rarely seen in pure romance novels. It was just breathtaking.A truly riveting and intense read, Against the Tide is definitely a novel not to be missed! Rich in historical background and details, and entertaining from start to finish, this is not a tale I will soon forget. Recommended for more mature readers however, as it is a \"darker\" book and deals with mature subjects such as drug addiction and kidnapping.Buddy-read with Maria and Tweety! Thank you ladies :)"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19799133-maria", "userReview": "Lydia Pallas\u2019 childhood was not easy. Uncertainty and fear are the only two words that can describe it. But now, at twenty-four, she has got a job she loves as a translator for the US Navy, a lovely apartment in Boston and new hopes and dreams for her future life. But her skills with languages will put her in danger when she meets Alexander \u201cBane\u201d Banebridge and accepts to work with him in order to accomplish a delicate mission.You know you loved a book to pieces when you cannot stop thinking about its story and characters, and that is exactly what happened to me with this novel. This was my first book by Elizabeth Camden and it was definitely a winner! I loved how the author wrote about a very serious problem -smuggled opium- while adding to the story a thrilling and enchanting romance. It was simply wonderful! I have to admit that the blurb did not impress me a lot, but since this was a buddy read I started to read it all the same although with no particular expectations (just the anticipation of a lovely chat with my friends Anne and Tweety ;)). I was not ready for all the emotions I would feel!! From the very first page I knew this was going to be a great read and I just loved Ms. Camden\u2019s writing. I found that she got straight to the point, she never once bored me and everything was extremely compelling. Every time I picked this book up I always found myself saying: \u201cOK. Just one more page.\u201d... and I ended up reading two more chapters! The main theme is not easy to deal with. It all starts with illicit ways to sell opium and then goes deep into describing opium addiction and its consequences. But it is not at all a heavy read! The author cleverly adds wonderful characters, some actions and a sweet romance to give us readers one of the most engaging books ever written in history! -I- will definitely add it to my list of favourites! If you have never read a story with a strong heroine, you need to read this one as soon as you can because Lydia Pallas is one of the most determined and stubborn heroines -probably the strongest one- I have ever met. She is not perfect, far from that actually, but she never lets anything or anyone stop her from achieving her goals. Her life has always been difficult, nobody has ever given her anything as a gift. All she has, she has earned it with perseverance and firmness of purpose. Bane is... a whirlwind. A tornado. Someone that arrives and turns Lydia\u2019s life upside down. He teases her for her meticulous way of leading her life but deep down he needs that stability, too. He knows that he will never have it because of what he did in his past, but every time he stops and thinks about his life, he longs for peace and joy. He would never admit it but he desires more than anything a life free from danger. What a chemistry between these two!Two amazing characters, a thought-provoking story and just a little bit of action that had me on the edge of my seat, \u201cAgainst the Tide\u201d is a great read that you absolutely do not want to miss. I would recommend grabbing a copy as soon as you can!"}, {"userName": "Nymeria", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16051625-nymeria", "userReview": "Decided to drop this one.I liked the first half: Heroine is a translator for a US Navy office based in 19th century Boston? Awesome!But then everything went downhill fast. This book was not for me:1*The heroine had a really tough life. She was really scared she'd end up dirt poor again and guess what? She does. Because of the hero. The hero who used her and then abandonned her to pursue his anti-opium crusade. The hero she can't help but being in love with. He's all \"I'm so sorry you suffered because of me\" but it doesn't change the fact he left her in the lurch for several months.That's the point where I wished the heroine would do that when she sees the hero again:\nBut of course she doesn't. She luuuuvessss him so much.2*The inspirational aspect of the book really started to make me feel uncomfortable. It was barely there in the first half but then we have the hero deciding that the only true gift he can give the heroine is having her find God (because he knows best and there's no other way she'll be happy according to him). I have nothing against religion but this was just so much out of my comfort zone.Mental note: avoid inspirationals at all cost in the future."}, {"userName": "Amber Stokes", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3571177-amber-stokes", "userReview": "Deep, dark, and captivating. I started this book one evening and finished it a while later in the early morning hours - not because it is a quick read, but because it completely swept me away with its descriptions and its flawed, amazing characters. Camden has a wonderful talent, and her writing continues to get more and more remarkable with each new book! Against the Tide begins with Lydia, giving a sketch of her fascinating but tragic background and then diving into her life as a confident and intelligent adult with a unique career. Some of her quirks ring true for me, and I love her character for her strength and her all-too-real weaknesses. Camden throws challenge after challenge Lydia's way throughout the story, and it's so horribly sad to witness what she goes through. But oh! The empathy!! What a beautiful thing to be able to feel a character's pain so much that it causes tears and gut-wrenching empathy! It is not an easy journey for Lydia - especially towards the end - but it is a meaningful one with hope and newfound purpose (with a nod to Bane's character - his deep devotion and passion). To be able to feel her emotions so deeply myself....to understand how hard it was for Lydia to make the right choices and to accept love while in such a difficult, humble state...it was a powerful reading experience.Perhaps not everyone will connect with Lydia's character the way I did, but I really think that Camden does a marvelous job of getting into her characters' minds and hearts and helping the reader to do so, too. And while I was most impacted by Lydia's emotional struggles, this story also has plenty of intrigue and suspense, along with a romance that is thrilling, tender, and thought-provoking. There is a lot to love and a lot to ponder with this story!If you enjoy a well-written historical romance that is flooded with mystery and drama, Against the Tide is a great read. But if you're like me, take note: you might just find that the emotion comes up like a sneaker wave and engulfs you.*With thanks to the publisher through CFBA for providing me with a copy of the book in exchange for my honest opinion.*"}, {"userName": "Rissi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16024231-rissi", "userReview": "Writing historical fiction demands the writer have a talented pen \u2013 and a lot of patience. Any historical author worth their salt will take hours in preparation to research their subject or setting or the era, and as a girl who appreciates an anticipatory historical novel, I respect this. Elizabeth Camden is probably one of my favorite authors \u2013 this is her third novel and out of those, two have been relegated to a spot on that ever-growing keeper shelf. Many fans may remember Against the Tide\u2019s hero \u2013 Alexander Banebridge or Bane as he is more commonly known \u2013 from Camden\u2019s debut novel, which may have been published last year, but I feel like \u2018Tide\u2019 is the best in its genre from this year \u2013 comfortably so. Camden\u2019s voice has matured to the point of expert dialogue and brilliantly written settings that intrigue and tease, never giving away \u201ctoo much.\u201d This is perhaps what will most impress aficionados of history - Camden\u2019s \u201csense of setting.\u201d It was interesting and leaves a reader loathe to turn the last page \u2013 the era was very well presented and it made everything more authentic to read (historical note) what one of Camden\u2019s starting points was for this novel. Woven into the period details is a deeper, subtle message of faith. The achievement of the message and its greatest asset is the hero. Using the \u201cheroes are made, not born\u201d adage to the best advantages, Camden formed Bane, an anti-hero into a very noble, swoon-worthy kind of hero who, while redeemed as a new life in Christ (this we never doubt), it was interesting for the observer to still pick up on some of his previous attitudes and \u201cbad habits.\u201d Bane was once always on the cusp of pure evil (or this is my recollection), even now while shadows cling to his person, he\u2019s a better man. I am not sure I\u2019ve seen it done so well before \u2013 the narrative thread (of faith) wasn\u2019t prominent nor overwhelming but the discerning reader will \u201cfeel\u201d the passion and grace Bane emulates. Pacing of the story also factors prominently in the \u201cbig picture\u201d of the plot. Writing with an easy, pleasant prose, Elizabeth anchored the story in rich period authenticity, true but also important is the integrity of the characters; she never lost sight of their emotions. Doubling down on its fast-paced adventure was the pacing \u2013 even in the quieter moments. There\u2019s excitement and still plenty of time to savor the hero and heroine\u2019s \u201cbonding.\u201d Bane is not the only complexity in the story \u2013 Lydia is also, though hers is through innocence. As a reader, I didn\u2019t expect all her story entailed and admired because her character was a risk and it paid off. In the elements revolving around both Lydia and Bane as a couple, it surprised me how little the romance factored in \u2013 Lydia falls hard for Bane but an unusual amount of time separates them and the love story isn\u2019t the easiest to \"buy\" given that timeframe; that being said, I never doubted her love for him, and likewise (despite his claims), his for her. Weaving a beautiful story that is facilitated by its accuracy of the surroundings, I was undeniably impressed with Elizabeth Camden\u2019s third novel. It\u2019s one I am sure to re-visit, and it leaves me breathless for her next endeavor... \u00a9 Copyright 2011-2013 Dreaming Under the Same Moon / Scribbles, Scripts and Such"}, {"userName": "Monique", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7267268-monique", "userReview": "As a beautiful work of historical Christian fiction, I consider Elizabeth Camden\u2019s \u201cAgainst the Tide\u201d a great read for all\u2014not just for Christian readers. This book is very well written with fascinating characters and an excellent blend of mystery, suspense, romance, and redemption.The plot of \u201cAgainst the Tide\u201d is centered around an opium (a narcotic drug) addiction problem in the U.S. that had led to extreme crime and severe suffering in the late-1800s, and from what I could tell this book is historically accurate. The author really did her research. I found this story especially interesting because the U.S. is facing a very similar problem today with opium.The development of each character is very well paced. Camden keeps you guessing as the history and motives of each character are slowly unveiled with brilliant timing. Most of the characters have visible flaws, which I really appreciate because this makes them much more realistic, more human.Bane in particular is such a complex, mysterious, and intriguing character! The Bane you see in the beginning, middle, and end of this story, are all very different. This character is constantly evolving throughout this book and my opinion of him changed drastically from beginning to end, which I love. I believe he has more depth than any other character in this book.There is also a character that is so inherently evil that reading about him/her made my skin crawl, however this character has an outward appearance to most of a well-educated and highly intelligent individual with a kind disposition, which makes this person even more creepy\u2014a definite wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. I won\u2019t spoil who this character is, but I will say that he/she added a lot of shock and suspense to this story!Outside of some necessary terrors that keep the reader on the edge of his or her seat, this book is clean with no cursing or sexual situations in it, which I really respect the author for. I also admire how the author blended faith into this story without being overbearing or \"preachy,\" making this book appealing to believers and nonbelievers.Finishing \u201cAgainst the Tide\u201d was bittersweet. I'm happy to have read this book, however I'm sad to be finished with it because I was enjoying it so much that I didn't want it to end. This was a very realistic and exciting read with an element of adventure to it.I highly recommend this book and I know I'll want to read it again in the future.I finished reading this book for the first time on May 14th, 2017."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5252799-anne", "userReview": "May Contain Spoilers!!!Bane! Bane! Bane! That was my refrain after reading The Lady of Bolton Hill. I wanted Bane's story. I'm sure he was meant to be only a secondary character but for me, he stole the show in that book. Once a renowned and highly feared drug dealer, Bane was raised by a terrible man who takes young children as hostages in order to control their parents. No one knows that the Professor is an opiate dealer and that he taught Bane everything about the business, grooming him to take over one day.Against the Tide is set 10 years after we've witnessed Bane receive Christ and begin his journey to freedom. He has dedicated his life to thwarting the Professor's drug operation. There are no close, personal relationships for fear that the Professor would kidnap whoever he thinks is meaningful to Bane in order to control him. I love Bane's character. He's always fascinated me with his cunning and intellect; that doesn't change. His drive and determination are incredible. I love the way he manages to get under Lydia's tough exterior. The scenes dealing with Lydia's drug addiction are realistic. They were intense and such a big part of the story and her relationship with Bane. We learn much about how opium was used and how easy it was to become addicted to the substance without even knowing it. The author does a great job of depicting poverty and wealth, evil and good. The story is unbelievably well written and the dialogue exchanges between the characters is riveting. I highly recommend this book to fans of Historical fiction.

This was the first novel I've ever read where one of the main characters has a drug addiction and must realize it and overcome- the unique and real life twist made it all the more grievous and compelling, as the reader gets drawn in and comes to understand the impossibility of the hero and heroine finding happiness so long as the situation remains.I'm so glad Bane had his own story because he was one of my favorite characters in the previous novel (well, towards the end. ;))!Very well done - I look forward to reading Camden's other works.

Really, this book is thick with historical detail about the Nineteeth Century opium trade. This is one of the things I love about Camden's novels ... the history. BUT! For those of you who hate history like I despise mathematics, do not be faint of heart! This is not a history book. It is a novel. And, I believe even those who aren't huge on historicals will enjoy this one.Here's why....Characters: Lydia is an orphaned young woman who will have an intelligence level I will never attain. Her ability to learn languages makes her character unique in many aspects and sets her aside from the proverbial historical independant woman. I love that Elizabeth Camden has made her heroine spunky and independant while choosing a one-hundred-percent unique career with the U.S. Navy of all places. No mail order brides, seamstresses, or school teachers here folks. Nuh. Uh. And don't get me started on Bane -- the \"bane\" of Lydia's existence -- his over-confident charming arrogance had me at \"hello\" (although I believe we did see snippets of him in past Camden writings-- if my memory serves me right). He reminds me of that know-it-all type who can do anything and has no weakness - anywhere - except when it comes to Lydia.Setting: The drug world of the 1800's. And we thought we had a meth issue! Talk about drugs. Opium to be specific. Who knew Americans tanked their infants up on drugs and orphanages used drugs to subdue orphans. Now that's a new take on discipline. I'll pass. But really, it's intriguing, suspenseful, deadly and the greatest base for a GREAT novel!Romance: Thick. Did you ramp it up this time, Elizabeth? Cause I don't remember the romance being this gripping. And it's not like the two main characters are macking on each other. Seriously. I think it's the tension and the thick attraction in spite of the odds. I don't know, honestly.

While it was building groundwork for the plot, it was more everyday matters they were going through. The second half of the book simply exploded with plot and intrigue!2nd: I've never read a book where the \"lovely, perfect heroine\" goes through a struggle like the type Lydia Pallas did! I can't say what it was or I would spoil some of the story for those who haven't read it, but I will say that I appreciated having the characters see each other at their worst (sounds strange, I know, but it makes the story more realistic than your average fluffy romance where the heroine's hair is never awry, and the hero always keeps his cool).As a side note, the hero for this story first appeared in The Lady of Bolton Hill. I have not read that one, but it did not ruin the story for Against the Tide.Overall, I'd say this was a solid 4.5 stars. There were several random comments or descriptions made in the book that I thought were not necessary, but they did not ruin the story. Also, I would have liked for the Gospel and salvation message to be clearer (the author was aiming for it, but never really came out and said it.

I was pleased to find that the story inside was as wonderful as the cover. The story gripped me from the beginning and kept me turning the pages until the end.After reading a disappointing book with typical romance, this was just what I needed to read. The romance was not typical. Instead of denying their feelings for each other, they admit it. That alone was a refreshing change. The only thing about the romance that I didn\u2019t like is that the two of them decide at one point that even though they know they can\u2019t be serious about each other, they will indulge in a flirtation. However, even that has a redeeming quality to as they soon realize that that is impossible. Also Bane is a Christian and Lydia is not when they start their romance. It didn\u2019t bother me much, but I wish she had become a believer before Bane became serious about her.Lydia was a character that I could instantly fall in love with. She had a hard early life, but she worked hard to overcome it. She is a wonderful mix of sweet and strong. In fact, all the characters in this book were amazing and well done. They are all complex, all make mistakes, but in the end, the good guys do what is right. I also really enjoyed the complex character of Bane.I didn\u2019t know how I would feel about reading of efforts to end the opium trade, but I was fascinated. Elizabeth Camden brought history to life in this story without making it too disgusting to read. She managed to show how opium hurt many people of the time without going into so much detail that it made you want to put down the book.I think this book would be a great book for parents and teens to read together and discuss everything from how much drugs can cost you, to why casual romance is problematic (and can even be dangerous), and many other topics.I highly recommend this book for those who love historical fiction, unique characters, thought-provoking stories, or just a great, page turning read.I received this book from Bethany House in exchange for my honest review.

Not the usual, expected story, but a crazy, tense, and wonderful tale that leaves you wishing for more!

We follow the story of a young man who was once caught up in smuggling the vicious drug; and a young woman who'd been spoon-fed opium since she was a little child. Also, of a insane man who kidnaps little boys and collects ancient books. With a good dose of breath-taking suspense, an impossible romance, and a lethal and seductive drug, Against the Tide makes for a superb novel.

I don't think it's a secret that I absolutely loved Bane when I first met him in The Lady of Bolton Hill, so I could barely contain my excitement when I found that Bane would have his own book! And Against the Tide more than lived up to my frighteningly high expectations. Lydia was the perfect heroine, and the perfect complement to Bane's larger-than-life, \"glorious rascal\" persona. The characters touched my heart and swept me away, Ms. Camden has created a pair of characters that I will remember LONG past the turning down of the final page, and that I plan on revisiting in the future. I loved Bane's passion and sense of duty, as well as his fierce protective streak. Lydia was so admirable, yet she had her own personal struggles, and she overcame so much! Lydia was a wonderfully rounded character!Adventure abounded within Against the Tide 's pages! The characters and the fast moving plot kept me glued to the pages long past my bedtime. Well written and researched, Against the Tide is my favorite of Ms. Camden's books so far!Overall, an entralling read that left me hoping that this wasn't the last I would see of Bane and Lydia, maybe they could cameo in an upcoming book? Natural descriptions and a wonderfully fleshed out setting, really brought Lydia and Bane's world to life.

It started out strong. I loved Lydia's earlier life with her parents, her painful losses, and her endurance. But, as the story progresses, the characters act inconsistently and not appropriate to the time period. Secondly, I struggled with Bane (the hero) and Eric, (the admiral). In the beginning, the admiral was larger than life; riding to the rescue of damsels in distress, ignoring conventional boundaries to do what was right for others, and basically being an all-around decent soul. But, then he just drifts away from the pages, literally. When he reappears, his metamorphosis to a cruel, unforgiving man didn't fit with his earlier character.Now on the other hand Bane, the hero, was consistent. A consistently annoying, pompous,vain individual who hid behind his faith, and his drive to prevent opioid addiction, as an excuse for selfish bad behavior. I didn't like him from start to finish. His relationship with Lydia was toxic. She deserved a better man.It sounds like I didn't enjoy the book. I actually did, but it was slightly off-kilter."}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64111391-courtney", "userReview": "I absolutely enjoyed this novel, there was not one thing that I did not like about it.

No hab\u00eda o\u00eddo hablar de Elizabeth Camden pero ya me he puesto al d\u00eda gracias a Goodreads, esta autora tiene unos cuantos libros publicados de este estilo, la mayor\u00eda autoconclusivos como este, ojal\u00e1 podamos seguir disfrutando de sus historias. Con este libro aterrizamos en el Boston de 1891, contada en tercera persona desde el punto de vista de los protagonistas.Ha sido una lectura muy interesante por varias razones pero en especial por Lydia, nuestra protagonista, con apenas veinticuatro a\u00f1os posee la bravura de todo un ej\u00e9rcito, a pesar de la \u00e9poca en la que vive no se deja amedrentar y consigue un trabajo como traductora en un astillero naval. No solo habla a la perfecci\u00f3n cinco idiomas (ruso, alban\u00e9s, griego, turco e ingl\u00e9s) sino que tambi\u00e9n sabe desenvolverse por el mar, desde bien peque\u00f1a vivi\u00f3 en un barco junto a su familia, hasta que queda hu\u00e9rfana. As\u00ed que su trabajo le viene como anillo al dedo.La muchacha vive en una c\u00f3moda rutina, siendo su \u00fanica preocupaci\u00f3n reunir todo el dinero posible para pagar su apartamento. Bebe los vientos por su jefe, el almirante Fontaine, un viudo de unos cuarenta a\u00f1os. Siente la obligaci\u00f3n de demostrar su val\u00eda d\u00eda tras d\u00eda para que su superior vea que, a pesar de ser mujer, tiene la misma capacidad que el resto de sus compa\u00f1eros.Su burbuja de felicidad se ve atacada por el Adonis, Alexander Banebridge (Bane). Nuestro protagonistas tiene varios nombres, aunque no dir\u00e9 por qu\u00e9. Es un amigo del almirante y contrata a Lydia para que le traduzca diversos textos, animada por su jefe la chica acepta de buen grado.Sin comerlo ni beberlo, Lydia se ver\u00e1 inmersa en numerosos peligros a causa de Bane. Aqu\u00ed es donde la protagonista demuestra toda su val\u00eda, dejando en un segundo plano a Banebridge. Bane ha luchado contra la distribuci\u00f3n y venta del opio durante a\u00f1os, sin la ayuda de Lydia no hubiera podido lograr lo que consigue al final del libro, la muchacha se enfrenta sola a El Profesor y adem\u00e1s logra superar una dura enfermedad.\u00ab... a menos que ocurriera un milagro, ella y Bane no ser\u00edan m\u00e1s que dos barcos que se cruzan en el oc\u00e9ano en mitad de la noche.\u00bbSu relaci\u00f3n en un primer momento era tirante, m\u00e1xime con los muros que levanta el hombre contra cualquier tipo de relaci\u00f3n o afecto. Lydia ir\u00e1 rompiendo muralla a muralla hasta poder llegar a \u00e9l. No ser\u00e1 nada f\u00e1cil.\u00ab-Llevo mucho tiempo buscando un faro, una gu\u00eda, pero todo es in\u00fatil. Una y otra vez choco contra las rocas y me veo arrastrada hacia el mar.\u00bbEl comportamiento de Bane me result\u00f3 bastante ego\u00edsta, me hubiera gustado que Lydia acabara con Eric -aunque tampoco se port\u00f3 bien con ella-. O mejor a\u00fan, que permaneciera soltera. Creo que ha sido la \u00fanica con seguridad, agallas y valent\u00eda suficiente para hacer frente al culpable de todas las adicciones de la sociedad.Para m\u00ed Bane no ha estado a la altura, adem\u00e1s ha soltado unas perlitas que no me han gustado nada (\u00abyo no me caso con ....\u00bb, no termino la frase para no hacer spoilers). En ning\u00fan momento duda en poner en peligro a Lydia, la chica siempre acaba sac\u00e1ndole las casta\u00f1as del fuego y despu\u00e9s la aparta.Aunque alguna vez le dedica alguna palabra bonita como: \u00abLydia yo soy tu faro. Ahora mismo, mi prop\u00f3sito en el mundo es sostenerte y guiarte hasta el puerto. No pienso abandonarte.\u00bb. Soy m\u00e1s de hechos que de frases.Por \u00faltimo, no s\u00e9 si es la traducci\u00f3n, correcci\u00f3n o estilo de la autora pero he encontrado una barbaridad de adverbios de modo (acabados en -mente). No s\u00e9 si es una man\u00eda personal pero me chirr\u00eda verlos, sobre todo si hay varios en una misma p\u00e1gina. No son necesarios ni imprescindibles (suavemente se puede sustituir por \u00abcon suavidad\u00bb por ejemplo). Empobrecen bastante el texto y es una pena porque la autora escribe muy bien.En resumen, \u00abContra la marea\u00bb es una novela que nos sumerge en el mundo de las adicciones y el naval, de la mano de una protagonista fuerte y con gran personalidad que desde bien peque\u00f1a solo sobrevive e intenta hacerse un hueco entre los hombres. Siendo independiente y luchando por sus convicciones. En medio de esta trama llena de misterio tambi\u00e9n habr\u00e1 hueco para una relaci\u00f3n casi imposible, aunque Lydia no se rinde con facilidad."}, {"userName": "Gwendolyn Gage", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5596940-gwendolyn-gage", "userReview": "A survivor of tragedy and a childhood spent in an orphanage, Lydia has worked hard to establish a comfortable and secure life for herself, and she\u2019s proud of her job as a translator for the Boston Navy Yard. Along comes a blond-headed archangel who\u2019s acquainted with her boss and calls himself \"Bane\", and even if he is a shameless flirt bent on destroying the order of her desk, he\u2019s willing to pay an extravagant amount for translations of various foreign documents, and she needs the money for her apartment. Her questions about Bane eat at her conscience, even as she appreciates his money. Why does he need menus translated? Is he simply throwing her foreign nonsense in order to keep up their association? Who is he and where does he come from?Bane was an awesome, and I loved him. After finishing \"Against the Tide\", I learned that Bane made his first appearance in another of Camden\u2019s books\u2014\"The Lady of Bolton Hill\", and I wish I had read that book first. I will certainly be reading it now! Bane was a character, and had a great mix of admirable qualities and flaws. I found his willingness to risk Lydia consistent with his lack of non-business relationships. I mean, his association with the admiral is the closest thing he has to a friendship, he was raised by a psychopath, and until Lydia, all he knows is his dedication to hacking away at the lucrative opium empire. Rather than a woman wanting a coddling, over-protective gentleman, he needed someone who would embrace his risky lifestyle and rise to challenges with him. And given Lydia's contradictory craving for adventure and obsessive need for order and security (great paradox by the way), I thought she and Bane went together like peanut butter and jelly.My favorite part of the book is the flirting between Bane and Lydia in the beginning\u2014Bane waltzes into the Navy Yard office, on a mission to mess with Lydia\u2019s orderly desk while passing by to the Admiral\u2019s office. And the scene with the cow, just beautiful, lol. The romance happens early on in the book, but the characters' hunger for companionship combined with flirtation and interaction time, worked to make it believable. A few times, I was slapped by pivotal decisions, and wished I could've seen the flow of thought that proceeded those decisions, but for the most part, the author handled transitory passages with skill, knowing when to zoom into a scene, and when to summarize.There were a few things I thought inconsistent with the late 19th century time period, for instance, \u201cTurkey\u201d instead of Anatolia or the Ottoman Empire, and the hero massages the heroine\u2019s feet (I don\u2019t think a modest 19th century woman would have allowed him, but then, given her circumstances...)It's clear to me why \"Against the Tide\" won this year's Christy and Rita awards. The character development, the building suspense, the stunning set-backs and flawless way the author built the plot through character action (rather than writer contrivances)\u2014simply awe-inspiring. Great pacing, and the setting details never got away. Not to mention the fascinating history behind the world\u2019s indulgent use of opium. I knew that adults used opium freely back then, but I didn\u2019t know they gave it to teething babies!My favorite bit of the book\u2019s brilliant flirtatious banter:Lydia says, \u201c \u2018Besides, you looked awfully dashing yourself, conducting business with the governor at the State House. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t have a trail of women following you.\u2019Bane flashed her one of those negligent smiles. \u2018Well it is true I\u2019m terribly sought after. I can hardly walk down the street without women pestering me. I am a victim, really. You should be much kinder to me.\u2019 \u201d"}, {"userName": "Heidi Hart", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19577177-heidi-hart", "userReview": "I've never read inspirational romance, but I'm trying to expand my horizons and get out of the English Regency rut, and I was intrigued by the prospect of a book set in Victorian Boston. The heroine is a Greek orphan who works as a translator for the Navy, on the cover she is looking out at a ship in the harbor, and the book is called Against the Tide: I thought there would be sailboats, and I am a sucker for Tall Ships. Unfortunately, this book is not about boats: it's about opium and faith.Lydia's parents and baby brother were lost at sea when she was at school one day, leaving her to be raised in an orphanage where the staff kept the kids in line by dosing them with Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup. Now grown, Lydia still uses Mrs. Winslow's to sleep and treat headaches: little does she know, the medicine is full of opium, and she's been an addict since childhood.Bane was kidnapped as a child and raised by a shadowy bibliophile named The Professor, who funds his mania for rare books by smuggling opium, and who kidnaps boys like Bane from harbor masters and customs officials to secure the success of his smuggling operation. Back in the day, young Bane was the Professor's protege and an active participant in the opium trade. Then he found Jesus, and now he's made it his mission to foil the Professor at every turn.The dialogue in this novel seemed distractingly anachronistic, and there were some details specific to my native Vermont (where the Professor lives) that were flat out WRONG: there's no need to \"build a bridge\" from Vermont to Canada (they share a border without any body of water between them), and maple sap generally doesn't run at night (it's too cold). These flaws really got under my skin, and I also felt the plot was predictable, but I kept reading to the end because of the novelty factor. I'd never read a historical romance set in New England. I'd never read an inspie (and the proselytizing, while surely not everyone's cup of tea and not especially subtle, was not so heavy handed that it detracted from the story, and besides, I gave some leeway because proselytizing is partly the point of this sub genre). More importantly, I'd never read a book where the heroine is struggling to overcome a narcotic addiction, and I think that part of the story was really well done and very topical to anyone who has ever struggled with addiction or tried to love or live with an addict. Given the prevalence of addiction in our society, I bet there are a lot of people who might find comfort in this story, despite its flaws."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah", "userReview": "Such a great story!

I've actually got some old books that have the Mrs. Winslow's ad in the back.One of my favorite spots was the mention of the jasmine and rose soaps from Kentucky...since I'd literally just put down the \"Rose of Winslow Street\" book!Content caution: there is frank discussion of opium use and side effects and a description of withdrawals."}, {"userName": "B.

The protagonists were described correctly on page 350: \u201cThey were two imperfect people who had weathered the storms of life and had battle scars to show for it.\u201d Ms. Camden researched this book thoroughly. I was particularly impressed when Bane commented on Lydia\u2019s handwriting. My spouse is both a Certified Graphologist and a Certified Graphoanalyst. She advises me that that the conclusions he reached based upon the handwriting sample he described appear to be reasonably accurate.I enjoyed the Christian elements as portrayed here, particularly in describing Lydia\u2019s struggle to find her faith. However, I found that there is a doctrinal difference of opinion with the statement found on page 52 where it states, \u201c\u2026 if the serpent had never offered Eve the apple, they would all be living in Eden.\u201d Many Christian Churches share this belief. However, my Faith teaches that Adam and Eve, by voluntarily eating the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, actually opened the door for Spirit Children of God to come to this earth. Had they not done so, none of us would be here today. I found the storyline to be generally true to life and believable, with one possible exception. I found it a little hard to believe that Lydia would return to the woods night after night to make contact with Bane merely assuming that they were so \u201cin tune\u201d with each other that he would meet her there. That is a bit of a stretch. At the same time, I commend Ms. Camden's description of Lydia\u2019s ordeal in overcoming her addiction to opium.Against the Tide is not a feel-good romance. It has it\u2019s dark side, particularly in describing the manner in which the Professor maintained control over those he manipulated. The action kept me reading rapidly to find out where the next plot twist would take me. I heartily recommend this book and this author to my friends."}, {"userName": "Nidofito", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24180684-nidofito", "userReview": "What I loved about the book- The setting: It was completely different from anything I've read. I loved our heroine working as a translator, her connection to the navy/sea and her personality. - The addiction and recovery from drugs: Again, I've never read an HR, and more so a Christian HR, that went into such depth of drug addiction and how hard it is for users to stop. Elizabeth Camden is wonderful in using actual historical events and building a story from it. It gives the story a solid foundation and makes it rich and credible. Additionally, when was the last you ever read HR where the hero/heroine were less than perfect? Camden was also able to fit in our hero nicely within the drug business. Everything was done very smoothly.What I disliked about the book -The hero: As much as Bane was shown to be a better man, somehow he always came off as manipulative to me. Even when it came to Lydia, his behavior towards her for some reason never made me swoon. -The villain: Despite being a drug lord, our villain never once mentioned or referred to opium. Why was half the book about rare Greek manuscripts when he was supposedly the largest smuggler of opium into the States?-The story (part of it): I was hoping for a more nautical story, where Lydia's extensive sea traveling and language knowledge, combined with the use of opium, comes together on a really cool quest with Bane as they travel place to places to catch the villain.Special mention-The romance: The romance is always meh for me in Christian fiction. While I adore the simplicity and completeness of our couple's feelings (no love triangles or wishy-washy attitude here) I always want MORE, especially during scenes when they have physical contact. It does not necessarily mean sex, yet I'm always looking for more intense, stronger words when, say, kissing or during a romantic moment.-The religion: Again, I'm mostly indifferent about religion mention but it was a bit of a tune off in this book because it was a bit too much, especially how Bane approached the subject and his way of converting Lydia."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3458028-ruth", "userReview": "This was a fascinating look at a very dark period in American history, which I don't think I've ever seen or heard about in popular media, except in a passing, romanticized way in Sherlock Holmes stories. This book takes the insidious evil that was widespread opium addiction and weaves it into a wonderful story of American hope and new beginnings.I'm not a fan of Christian fiction or romances, but I'm an open-minded sort of person, and apart from a few pages towards the end which I felt might have verged on the preachifying just a little, I came away thinking that this author used the hero's faith as a means of broadening our understanding of him, in the process making him more real, more tangible and more interesting. People have all sorts of different reasons for doing what they do, and using his faith to explain this character's motivations made absolutely perfect sense to me and enriched the story IMO.Apparently, the hero, Bane, appears in a previous book in a series, but I didn't know that, and it didn't influence my choice nor my enjoyment of it. I was hooked by the cover, which is just about perfect, and then sucked in by the description, and I have to say, this book was a wonderful, wonderful read, with very few tropes, a lot of originality, and a very simple writing style, which I found endearingly straightforward. The only issue I had was that it wasn't exactly clear why the hero and heroine fell for each other. It is clear how well they get on together, and how productive they are in achieving their goals, but there is a world of difference between friendship and respect and actually falling for someone, and I don't think this book really managed to bridge that.Anyway, 4 stars, I really liked it, and was not at all put off by the Christian themes."}, {"userName": "Kelli", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3596262-kelli", "userReview": "I thought the writing in the prologue was phenomenal! But once into the story, it gets super repetitive. Everything that goes through the main characters head, gets repeated and re-repeated. The story doesn't need fill-in thoughts, and for some reason the author writes them in. Also the time period is completely forgotten. The scenes are written like an 80's crime drama. People didn't talk like these characters do in the 1800's. And I really didn't love the fact that Bane a follower of Jesus and Lydia is not, when they start 'dating'. Yet he allows HER to pursue him? Not really historically or biblically ok. The stuff Lydia says half the time is incredibly desperate as well. Not an attractive trait at all. Towards the middle of the book, she full on goes after him even when he continually rejects her. Its sort of an odd mind game to the story, and not at all pleasant to read.
