This is sort of an open question in my field which most people aren't very actively addressing. But the topic always comes up at some point whenever we encounter a new model which seems to be doing something interesting. Inevitably someone asks the question: \"But does it really understand language?\"I was shocked and pleased to find that those sorts of discussions are not unique to the field of artificial intelligence. So too have researchers in nonhuman primate language acquisition been asking: \"But does he/she really understand?\"This book seriously awakened me to the degree to which Chomskian linguistics had infiltrated my thoughts about animal communication. Savage-Rumbaugh takes a strong stand against a mainstream (eastern-seaboard USA) linguistics, which she casts as dominated by over-theoretical, syntax-obsessed pedants. While the image of east-coast US linguistics isn't much better over here in the San Francisco Bay Area, her strong rhetoric against this mainstream really shocked me out of my preconceived notions of language. This book has motivated me to update my research direction. I now have some new ammunition for my next discussion once someone asks, \"But does it really understand?\"------I benefited a lot from the book for sure. But it gets three stars for 1) unnecessary biographical information, including unhappy diatribes about how her research was ignored and rejected from journals, 2) not very well grounded linguistic reasoning in places. These may not be a bother if you're just looking for a smooth read. But for someone who just wanted a grounded, no-nonsense introduction to a field, they were certainly distracting."}, {"userName": "Tani", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51941-tani", "userReview": "I put this on my to-read list back when I first joined Goodreads in 2005 or 2006. I guess it says something about my reading habits that it took me more than 10 years to finally read it. Oops? Anyway, I put it on there because I find language to be deeply interesting, and Kanzi is one of the most famous of the apes that was involved in the numerous language studies. Only later did I find out that a lot of those studies had been discredited. So, I was nervous that this book was going to be bad, to say the least. Thankfully, it was a very pleasant surprise! I really enjoyed this and found it quite interesting, despite the fact that quite some time has passed since the book's publication. Despite the title of the book, it focuses only loosely around Kanzi, which was a pleasant surprise. Instead, the book goes over the history of ape language studies, including the author's early efforts with the chimpanzees Sherman and Austin. And although Kanzi makes up a considerable part of the mid-section of the book, it also addresses issues with the application of the studies to assisting developmentally disabled children, as well as steps that the author recommends for the future of this research. I was really impressed with the thoughtfulness of the work that is embodied in this book. It's clear that a lot of thought went into these studies and into the notion of what language actually is. I was astounded to read of some of the things that Kanzi became capable of, which are far beyond what I had expected to see. Of course, it's necessary to take the work with a grain of salt, given that the researcher is also the author, but I felt that the author took care to point out as many alternate explanations and caveats as possible. I did have mixed feelings on the chapter about the application of the ape language studies so the children with developmental disabilities. First, given the time that this book was published, it does use correct terminology, but times have changed, and I definitely cringed every single time that the phrase 'mentally retarded children' was used. I also felt that this was by far the least detailed part of the book, which is a shame, as I would have liked to learn more. (Although, to be honest, this would likely have been the most outdated part of it, so I suppose the decision to be vague makes sense.) Overall, I really enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I would. I'm no expert, and I certainly can't make any statements about where studies are in the current day, but I enjoyed what I read here, and found that it gave me some serious food for thought."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob", "userReview": "Complex subject matter discussed adeptly and in-depth while keeping the language and concepts clear enough for a lay-person. Sue Savage-Rumbaugh manages to raise critical questions about the nature of language (and language acquisition) in this analysis of her work with Kanzi, taking special care not to anthropomorphize the bonobo too much. Beyond the intriguing scientific discussion, the book is also an engaging story about the author's work and the relationship she has built with her subject.A few other notes:* The title is a bit over-the-top and over-states the case a bit. That Kanzi appears to have developed his own language and grammar does not necessarily make him \"at the brink of the human mind\". Reading about his behaviors, he is still very much a chimp.* The images (photos, illustrations, diagrams) are very helpful in making sense of some of the text.* Videos would be helpful as well. Too bad you can put videos right onto the page. I would suggest you look for some out on the web. They're really quite amazing."}, {"userName": "Joe Iacovino", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5152368-joe-iacovino", "userReview": "Surprisingly more global than I had presumed. Although the bonobo Kanzi gives his name to the title of the book, the book itself allows itself intelligent extrapolation of the data he provided. All in all it was an interesting mix of data, anecdote, evolutionary history, as awareness plea, and philosophy. This was an easy read which flowed well. I was simply surprised about how much information there was with regard to things learned through the research with, and directly from, Kanzi. My only complaint is that my copy of the book for some reason repeated pg 181 on 183 for no apparent reason and the contents of 183 were missing."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/156977-amy", "userReview": "I had my students read portions of this for Animal Behavior.
