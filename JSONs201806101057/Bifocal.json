Racism is bad. Religious intolerance is bad. In this post-9/11 world we live in, danger can come from anywhere and it's very easy for anyone to be accused of terrorism and this is also bad. I PROMISE, YOU HAVE MADE YOUR POINT. I understand and respect what you were trying to do with this story - having one of you write from the perspective of a white football player and the other write about a Muslim Afghan boy and then tossing them together at a high school where a Muslim student has been arrested as a suspected terrorist was a good idea for a story. I just don't particularly love the way you both chose to go about telling the story. For starters, both the main characters (Jay and Haroon) are, for lack of a more polite word, pussies. Everyone around them has strong opinions and actually does something about them; Jay and Haroon are always just sort of going along for the ride and trying not to draw attention to themselves. It is frustrating when you have to root for a pair of fence-sitters who are, really, sort of spineless. Also, the ending was a total letdown. You set up this whole interesting premise where a group of suspected terrorists has been arrested, and one of them is a sixteen-year-old boy. But do you tell us anything about the actual trial? Do we get to see a trial or know how this kid was connected to the other suspected terrorists? Do you even tell us how the police decided to arrest this kid? No, you do not. I realize that this is realistic, but just because something is realistic doesn't mean it'll make a good story. Good storytelling involves tying up loose ends, and your story starts multiple threads and then just leaves them dangling so we can watch Jay and Haroon do nothing some more. So in conclusion, I understand what you were trying to do with this story. I just didn't really understand why you decided to tell it the way you did.Sincerely, MadelinePS: I don't know what made Eric Walters think he could write accurate teenage dialogue, but he was wrong. So very, very wrong. He sounds sort of like whenever that guy who writes Family Circus decides to throw in an American Idol reference to remind his audience that the comic doesn't take place in the 50's - misguided and a little sad.

At Bifocal\u2019s Central Secondary, a high school in an unnamed Canadian metropolis, there\u2019s a section for the kids from India, Pakistan, and the Middle East called Brown Town. There\u2019s a place over by the doors, nearly outside, for the Goths and \u201cemos,\u201d who are \u201csort of diet-Goth.\u201d The black kids sit in Cafrica near the Asian kids who dress like blacks and are called Jackie Chans. Of course, as anyone who went to high school knows, the jocks sit nearest the food and the pretty, popular girls sit where the jocks can see them.The authors\u2019 strategy for creating this book about bigotry and fear is ingenious: the text is written by two people, alternating the points of view of two different characters. Eric Walters, a social worker and coach with forty-six books to his name, writes from the perspective of a white athlete, Jay, a rising football star being groomed for the position of captain in his senior year. The book opens with Jay and other teammates climbing through a ceiling to get some perspective on a \u201clockdown\u201d situation at the school. From their elevated position, they vocalize both wonder and contempt for the SWAT teams, bomb squads, and fleets of police that surround the school.The other main character of the story, Haroon, has an entirely different take on the proceeding. It was in his classroom that the trouble began when police burst into his \u201cReach for the Top\u201d rehearsal (an inter-school quiz competition) and cuffed him and the only other \u201cbrown\u201d kid in the class, Azeem, for charges unknown. Deborah Ellis, the author of the Haroon segments, is a peace activist who has traveled the world to hear the stories of children marginalized by poverty and conflict.Bouncing back and forth between white and brown, Muslim and everything else, right, wrong, high, low, and the \u201cwar zones\u201d of football field, dinner table, and community, Ellis and Walters\u2019 cooperation is both energetic and thoughtful. Bifocal will interest teens of all colors and backgrounds, and will make an excellent resource for teachers who wish to discuss controversial issues in their classrooms.

Told by the two main characters with alternating viewpoints, the book tackles a number of controversial issues which could lead to some excellent class discussion. Haroon and Jay are two senior boys from vastly different racial backgrounds,trying to survive in an ethically divided high school which has worsened since 9/11. We share their experiences, perceptions and participation in a number of events including physical violence and verbal attacks. Neither of the two boys is perfect, they both make mistakes as they try to deal with everything going on around them. While I found Haroon the more convincing character, Jay was still likeable. There are a few unpleasant scenes described in this book and some of the issues raised are not essential to the story, but overall it is quite a page-turner and ends on a positive note."}, {"userName": "Sumayyah", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1485895-sumayyah", "userReview": "3.5 starsI liked it, even though it is VERY flawed, with a few inconsistencies, but it gets the point across (although both authors are white, and far removed from their teenage years).It could have been done much better, but I still liked it, if only that there are few teen books that deals specifically with this type of racism. (Well, there are books about this, but are almost always written by real Muslims and almost never see a mainstream following.)Additionally, it deals almost completely with the AFTERMATH of the lock down of the school due to \"terrorist\" activities and focuses on students were not a part of the suspected terror cell.

I realize this came out a while ago (2007) and Deborah Ellis is famous in some circles but not others yet I have no idea why this title has not received more publicity and recognition. This book is amazing. Ellis and Walters (they wrote the book together) created an incredibly engaging and thought-provoking novel that, at times, can make you uncomfortable but gets you thinking and asking questions about our own stereotypes and prejudices in a way that doesn't sugar coat yet leaves you feeling hopeful and optimistic. The story is told through two alternating points of view. Jay is a white high school football player who has a limited understanding of Islam and thinks he's a tolerant (non-racist) person because he has friends from various cultures. Haroon is a third generation Afghan-Canadian who feels very \"normal\" and mainstream yet he experiences a lot of prejudice on account of his skin color and faith and is mistaken for an Islamic terrorist. It's a very down-to-earth story with very little flashiness or exaggeration. The two perspectives are striking because they are different and show how different these two teens' lives are but what's even MORE interesting to me is seeing how SIMILAR they actually are.I enjoyed the supporting cast of characters possibly even more than I enjoyed reading about Jay and Haroon. Haroon's sister Zana is fantastic for standing up for her faith and against prejudice even when it was not easy. I liked Steve a lot -- his mixed-race perspective added another dimension and I absolutely loved the part where he and Jay talked after their prank. It was such a heartfelt and real moment that sort of made it \"click\" as to why hate is so pointless. I obviously disliked Kevin but people like him exist so we need to find ways to deal with them and stand up to their messages of hate. I also liked Ms. Singh (even though she was a big preachy) and I really loved Haroon's parents. They were not stereotypes and they showed that even though they are immigrants (second generation) and even though they are Muslim, they are not close-minded and actually have very progressive views on life and freedom. I wish this was required reading for middle school. I wish I could have found out about it sooner so I could have had more of my students this year read it. I wish this book got more publicity. I hope to encourage a lot of people to read it and to really stop think about what the book is telling you."}, {"userName": "Bego\u00f1a Pereda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46337892-bego-a-pereda", "userReview": "This fine piece of literature written by two award winning authors originary from Canada, Deborah Ellis and Eric Walters. Something I really liked about it is that it was written in two perspectives Jay's and Haroon's Jay's part was written by Eric Walters while Haroon's was written by Deborah Ellis. Jay is a white boy that likes to exercise and Haroon is 3rd generation Canadian Persian who is really intelligent.  The story takes place in three places, Jay's house, Haroon's House and their school, it is in the present time. The book starts with a lockdown and Jay decides to go to the top of the building, which he isn't allowed to, and Haroon stays in his classroom. When the chaos is over the police blames Haroon for being a suspect. This is the first clue of racism in the book and as it goes on it increases and shows how every story can have two different sides some can be good and others can be bad. I think this book is very well written because it combines the stories of both narrators and main characters, Jay and Haroon. The way it switches makes it more interesting and easy to read. I think that if the book was only narrated by one of the characters it would be a completely different story with totally different views. This book really made me more open minded and I think anyone who reads it and takes it seriously wil feel the same as me. Even if it is a fiction book things like this happen in the real life. The way it changes of perspective it makes you feel as if you were in their place, feeling what they feel and everything. I also really liked the end of the book because it has a lot of meaning and represents friendship in all races, religions and cultures."}, {"userName": "J.S.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s", "userReview": "Jay is a relatively new kid at school, but as a good football player he's already managed to integrate himself into the team and the coolest crowd at school. He's even managed to become good friends with the team captain and quarterback, and it looks likely he'll be recommended for captain next year. Haroon is a quiet kid who's a backup for the \"Reach for the Top\" team, an academic TV competition. He's also a Muslim, his grandparents having emigrated from Afghanistan long before. But things start to change for both of them when a terrorist plot is uncovered and a student is arrested and accused of being part of it. Haroon takes that boy's place on the academic team after nearly being arrested right alongside him, and Jay begins to see signs of prejudice and hatred even among his friends. My 11 year-old son and I read this and we both really enjoyed it. The story is told alternately from each boy's perspective with plenty of excitement and drama, and both kids see the effects of racism although they're each affected by it in different ways. The book tries and mostly manages to show both sides of the various arguments and how judging others can be unfair and harmful, although I didn't always think it was the most balanced view. The story isn't about terrorism but about how segregating into different crowds can have unintended consequences, whether it's whites who believe all Muslims are terrorists or Muslims who withdraw behind a burka and label all whites as racist. And I appreciated that the book seems to try very hard not to be preachy. We enjoyed it very much and especially liked the ending."}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32237373-autumn", "userReview": "Bifocal is a book about terrorism in a high school. It\u2019s told from two different perspectives; Jay and Harron. Jay is a jock, he plays on the high school football team. Harron is on a high school game show team and extremely smart, he is also Muslim \tThe beginning of the book set the scene as the terrorist attack was happening. It also introduced the characters. For me, the beginning and the end of the book were the most exiting parts; through the middle it just kept re-explaining the same scenario over and over again. It was extremely boring, it seemed like the authors were trying to make up time in the book. There was a lot of repetition. The end of the book is where the main action was, and the problems started being solved. But the very ending was made me really mad. The main question was never solved. In the begging of the book, Azeem, Haroon\u2019s friend was arrested because he was accused of being in a terrorist organization. The whole time we are waiting to find out if he is guilty or not, and we never find out! It is more realistic this way, but it also made me feel like reading this book was a waste of my time. \tThis book is good in the fact that it educates people about racism and also different religions and cultures. It seemed to be aged towards 13-18 year olds. Although it was a difficult read, it still educated me. \tOverall, I did not enjoy this book. It could have been a great book, if it was executed properly. Normally one would think a book written by two professional authors would have been twice as good, but this is not the case.

He gets decent grades, is on the football team and is pretty popular but nothing un-ordinary. Haroon is a Muslim boy whose parents originated from Afghanistan.

And things at there school are not the same. In their minds they are completely different but they are more like each other then they think.I finished this book because it is quite suspenseful, not only that but the idea of discrimination always seems to concern me.I think every kid should read this book because you will get inspired by the doings of Jake and the courage of Haroon.

Maybe in NZ we are more tolerant or keep our racist thoughts to ourselves.
