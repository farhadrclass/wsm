Children are naturally fanciful, unreliable creatures - not dishonest, but only able to offer the truth as their immature brains can grasp and explain it. When the story is revealed as the author's own, the reader feels compelled to accept a fictionalized account as mere degrees of separation from the truth. What Vaddey Ratner has accomplished with her striking and lovely In the Shadow of the Banyan is a tone poem. Its outline is based on the atrocious Khmer Rouge regime, but the narrative floats on themes of family, mythology and the deadly beauty of the author's homeland. The nanny of the story's narrator, Raami - the author's mirror character - says it best when she declares that stories \u201care like footpaths of the gods. They lead us back and forth across time and space and connect us to the entire universe.\u201d In the Shadow of the Banyan is a story that connects us to Cambodia's recent past and the genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge during the late 1970's. Because we are seeing the events unfold through the eyes and within the heart of a seven-year old girl, we are twisted and wrenched by a child's vulnerability and hope but spared the most gruesome details of torture and obliteration. In many ways this is a grace, for it allows us to focus on the child's small world of her privileged family and their servants without being overwhelmed by the incomprehensible horror of Cambodia's civil war. But it also renders some characters shadowy and incomplete and glosses over context that would have helped create a firmer narrative. Although the book jacket declares the novel covers the four years of the Khmer Rouge regime, the action is heavily concentrated on the first days and weeks after the capture and exile of Raami's family. The first half of the book is a near moment-by-moment recount of the first weeks after the Khmer Rouge declares a new state on April 17, 1975. The second half chronicles the splitting apart of Raami's family as one relative after another is slaughtered outright or dies as a result of their enslavement. There is a reference to the second anniversary of the Revolution and to Raami's ninth birthday. The book's final pages mention the war between Vietnam and Cambodia and the retreating Khmer Rouge armies, so it must end in the early weeks or months of 1979. This is significant to me because I feel the details invested in the early parts are tedious at times, whereas the shifts of time and events in the latter third of the novel, as Raami ages and suffers and grows as a refugee in her own homeland, are given broad, vague brushstrokes.Ultimately, however, it is a book I feel honored to have read. Ratner's language is lyrical and stirring; she creates gorgeous and vivid portrait of Cambodia, filling the reader with longing to see, hear, taste, and touch a vibrant, complex land. It offers a unique perspective into a history and culture little or mis-understood in the West and I hope other readers have the same reaction as I - of wanting to know more, to read more, to hear other survivors' stories - in an effort to understand and to humanize the newspaper headlines. My husband, as a teacher of high school history and social studies, received a Fulbright grant and spent several weeks in Southeast Asia a few years ago. Cambodia and Vietnam, in equal measure but for different reasons, touched him to his core. Vietnam's recent history he was, of course, more familiar; U.S. history books treat Cambodia's chaos as a post-script to the \"American\" War (as the Vietnam War is referred to in Southeast Asia). When you begin to fully grasp a reality that is little mentioned in our own history books, it's a horrible slap in the face - a sensation of guilt and anger that in your ignorance, you are somehow complicit. It is through the gift of authors such as Vaddey Ratner that these stories are told so we all can wake up and learn."}, {"userName": "Martha", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2020567-martha", "userReview": "This novel was slow going for me. This was a story the author admits is pretty much her own, of a childhood derailed and torn apart by the Revolution in Cambodia in the 1970s. As a sheltered and privileged child, she and her family are particularly vulnerable and very much unaware of what is brewing around them as they are evacuated from Phnom Penh and sent off to become farm laborers. Maybe it's just that she writes it a little too carefully, hanging on to people and moments a beat too long, fleshing them out with a little too much poetry, but I found her voice to be much more mature than seemed possible for a child narrator, even one who had to grow up fast in a matter of months. So as fascinating as I found the story to be, I wish the child had told the story as a child or that the adult that child became had told it from a more mature point of view. But I was grateful to read this story, this inside view of a place and time where idealism and reality showed different faces and very little of it seeped out into the world until long after so much damage was done and so many lives were lost."}, {"userName": "Didi", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682140-didi", "userReview": "I read In the Shadow of the Banyan at the beginning of the month. It took me three and a half days to read but then plunged me into a week + worth of thought. We\u2019re nearing the close of the month of May and I still can\u2019t get this book off my mind. I figure my reading for the month of May was all worth it because I had the pleasure of experiencing my second 5 star book of the year 2014. Now if you\u2019ve been following me here or over at frenchiedee you know that I absolutely don\u2019t have a habit of giving out 5 star ratings.In the Shadow of the Banyan is the fictionalised story of Vaddey Ratner\u2019s four-year ordeal living through the genocide that took place in Cambodia once the Khmer Rouge took over in 1975. The main character is called Raami and she is seven years old when the story begins. The first few chapters we are introduced to her family and their lifestyle. They are a wealthy and privileged family. They are a royal family in Cambodia and her father is a poet as well. Soon there after we learn that the Khmer Rouge have taken over the country and are driving the population from the city to the countryside. There they are made to work in the rice paddies, surviving on little food. The Khmer Rouge are enforcing Marxist philosophy on the population and forcing them to forget life as it was before. People of privilege, professors, scientists, teachers, artists, musicians, etc. are hunted down and killed. They are perceived as enemies to the Organization.This story is more than just a retelling of a historical event and of Ratner\u2019s experience. It is a story of human survival. One wonders how they would behave if they had to go through such a situation. I thought through it so much and feel as though I would have caved in and hoped for a swift death. Ratner shows the limits of human beings and how survival is not necessarily dictated by what one may think. Raami thinks a lot of her father, the things she remembers that he said to her, and of his poetry. Sometimes it\u2019s the simplest things that can help someone to survive.The writing in In the Shadow of the Banyan is absolutely beautiful! That Ratner could write such beautiful prose about such a blight on Cambodian history and on her family is remarkable. Since we see this story through the eyes of a seven year old, things are recounted with much detail. This detail may be perceived as wordy but I assure you that it is not the case. The descriptions are there so that we as readers are literally transported to Cambodia. We see, feel, and taste what Raami describes. There were passages that were difficult to read, but Ratner\u2019s writing becomes a metaphor for the insidious behaviour of the Khmer Rouge. In the beginning the people don\u2019t understand what is happening to them but quickly things change and they realise they are trapped in horror. Even Raami develops over the 410 pages tremendously. In the beginning, she is naive young and joyful despite her handicap, but her character development is portrayed with the right flow of the story.Another interesting aspect of this story is the relationship between mother and daughter in such a traumatic life/death event. Their relationship at the beginning of the story seems fairly undefined but thrown into the uncertainty of this historical event, mother and daughter learn a lot about each other and marvel over each others\u2019 strengths. This is one of the most touching parts of the story. I just can\u2019t gush enough over this novel. It\u2019s a must read. Pick this one up because you won\u2019t regret it."}, {"userName": "Tania", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6450088-tania", "userReview": "I didn't know so much sadness could exist in so small a placeThis must be one of the most exquisitely written books I've read in a long time. It's based on the authors own experience during the regime of Cambodia's Khymer Rouge. There is a few things that stands out and makes this different to other war/genocide books I've read. Firstly, the first part of the book is very slow and focuses on the beauty rather than the impending horror. At first I didn't understand, but closer to the end I realize that this is the way children see things. They are extremely adaptable, and as long they still believe that their immediate family is save, they think that they are protected and that nothing bad will happen. Especially as Raami had a very protected childhood before the war. The second differentiating factor was that the author really shows in detail how you can lose your life and everything that you love in an incremental way, and not in one big event. The war itself was also fascinating, I've never read anything about the Cambodian war/genocide, in fact I've never even heard of it before.

How can certain passages be of a horrific nature & yet be written in such a beautiful way that you must go back & re-read them? I don't know how, but this book does that. A story about the Cambodian genocide and all the tragedies that came from the Khmer Rouge coming into power in 1975, it is nontheless a beautiful book. The subject matter is heartbreaking & disturbing, reading about the true evil some people posess always is, but it's also a story of the strength of spirit & the endurance of love between people & the truly remarkable way people have of surviving the most terrible tragedies imaginable. That the story was told through the eyes of a 7 year old worked for me because it was written extremely well & though Vaddey Ratner wrote about her own experiences & drew the main character of Raami after her own self it followed more of a literature format than a memoir and this is what makes this book stand out from others that may be similar in subject matter. There were some truly beautiful moments in this story, words that swirled around your mind as you read them & enchanted you. I loved Ratner's inclusion of a love for poetry & words from 2 of the main characters, their love of stories, it was a beautiful connection between them & as an avid reader you can't help but connect to those feeelings.

As a novel it doesn't fare so well. I found myself skimming most chapters to extract an ok story from a swamp of flowery prose. The content-to-fluff ratio is about 1:3 most of the time, with occasional stretches of more focused story telling. It's not bad fluff as the stuff goes, and if it's your kind of thing then it may heighten your appreciation for the book. The only other downside is the dubious perspective that it's natural and right for royalty to be elevated above and fawned over by a population. This is likely an unconscious slip since the author makes a couple overt attempts to promote the opposite idea. Those scenes are not convincing and the undercurrent running through the book as a whole undermines them. It's also a little awkward at the end when the author parades her own position as royalty under the guise of honoring her father (a slain prince).If there were half stars, this would be 1.5 material."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "It is a few hours since I turned the last pages of this haunting and powerful novel, and I am still trembling from its nearly unbearable power. Such is the power of Vaddey Ratner\u2019s story telling.And it is story telling that is at the core of this book. At one point, Ms. Ratner reflects, \u201cA story, I had learned, through my own constant knitting and re-knitting of remembered words, can lead us back to ourselves, to our lost innocence, and in the shadow it casts over our present world, we begin to understand it.\u201dHer story is as universal as mankind, and yet uniquely her own. The story has been told \u2013 in varying ways \u2013 by Carolina De Robertis in Perla, by Naomi Benaron in Running the Rift, by Thomas E. Kennedy in In The Company of Angels, by William Styron in Sophie\u2019s Choice. It is as old as the hills, man\u2019s inhumanity to man, the brutishness, cruelty and sheer sadism of those who inflict damage in the name of an evil cause.In Ms. Ratner\u2019s capable hands, this familiar story rises to sheer poetry as she not only survives, but also transcends. In it, she inhabits her younger muted self and gives her a voice. (In an epilogue, we learn that details have been changed but her character\u2019s story is, in essence, her own). Raami \u2013 the little girl who speaks for Vaddey Ratner \u2013 is only seven when her world shatters; the infamous Khmer Rouge comes to power, destroying her innocence, her youth, and her family.What ensues is achingly real and beautifully realized. We follow Raami as she undergoes the ultimate in heartbreak, deprivation, loss, and sadness as the Khmer Rouge endeavors to destroy the last sparks of individuality and humanity. Yet even the worst humiliations cannot break her spirit; she clings to hope through the power of story telling and through small gestures of kindness. This impossibly brave author ended up in the United States after four years of forced labor and starvation and went on to graduate Cornell University, summa cum laude. Just as her father \u2013 a gentle poet \u2013 offered her wings, so she offers those wings to her readers.

Yes, it was well done. Probably the reason I liked it was that it is based on the author's experiences, from which she has crafted her novel. I thought the end was better than the beginning. The end very well depicted the horrors and the supreme idiocy of the Khmer Rouge regime. The tamer beginning reflects the innocence of the young girl, which is not inappropriate. She was at the beginning only seven! In reality, the author was only five.The traditional Cambodian culture and Buddhist beliefs are adroitly interwoven into the events. There are beautiful stories told, all part of the native culture.This book can more accurately be described as a story about the author's father seen through the eyes of his beloved child, the author. His name is not changed in the novel. He was a Cambodian prince, a man of of high ideals, a poet and man of much wisdom. His wisdom is not based on merely book knowledge, but rather a deep, morally sound understanding of people.This is both a philosophical novel (remember those stories) and a historical novel.The narrator, Greta Lee, easily read both the untranslated native language and English. The young daughter is telling of her experiences from 1975 through to 1979, when the Vietnamese entered the country, squashing the Khmer Rouge, freeing the Cambodians. The narrator does sound like a young girl - not an easy task when describing such horrendous events perpetrated by the \"Revolutionary Soldiers\"!This is the book to choose if you want to read about the Khmer Rouge and what they did 1975-1979. Well done, a splendid mix of a moving story that will pull your heart strings and give you the historical details too.

My sincere thanks for the opportunity to read this in e-galley format. With a poetic voice, Ratner plunges us into this personal trial of a royal family wrenched from their home in Phnon Penh, Cambodia, during the late seventies; a time of revolution. Robbed of her childhood, the narrator, seven year old Raami, brings us on this horrific displacement as she and her family endure homelessness, hunger, hard labor and the death of loved ones in the 4 years the story depicts. Though Raami's story which parallels with Ratner's own could easily leave my heart weighted down with sorrow, the beauty of Ratner's writing and the brilliancy of the human spirit manages to leave me with hope. In the end what struck me most about In the Shadow of the Banyan was that the imagery of this fictional memoir mirrors a truth that is far worse.

No shop assistant had pointed me in its direction. I stumbled across this beautiful, heart-felt debut by chance, and I'm glad I did.\"First and foremost, I wanted to honour the lives lost and those who made momumental sacrifices to save me.\"\u2013 Vaddey RatnerConsidering that Ratner began to learn English as an 11-yr old, the exquisite prose is all the more impressive. The East-Asian setting was brought to life with delicate wording, though some passages may have been overly descriptive for my taste. The beautiful writing clashes with the horrifying content \u2013 escape, hunger, and bloodshed. The story is told from the view of Raami, a young girl who had grown up in a noble family until the first days of war shattered her peaceful childhood. Knowing that the author had probably experienced many of the events described in the book herself made the content all the more gut-wrenching. To the me as a reader, it made no difference whether I was reading from Raami's or Vaddey's point of view, as biography and fiction probably blur seamlessly in In the Shadow of the Banyan. Though the narrator's voice was a bit too mature for a child of this age, the direct thoughts and actions were those of a young girl nonetheless.For me, this book holds importance due to many of us in our little tourist bubbles have forgotten what horrors Cambodians experienced during the Khmer Rouge regime. The Khmer Rouge, a nationalist movement blooming in the shadow of a communist party, were responsible for orchestrating a Cambodian genocide. During their reign, members of the former Cambodian government, intellectuals, and ethnic minorities were tortured and executed. As a descendant of King Sisowath, Vaddey Ratner's \u2013 and therefore also Raami's \u2013 royal name, which had once meant protection and comofrt, marked them for death during the Khmer Roughe reign. Ratner's childhood during the regime consisted of forced labour, starvation, and near execution. The despair of a child caught in the web of war is well reflected through the suffering of Raami.During the years of hardship, Raami's only source of hope are her father's stories and poems about courage and resilience. Words are an important tool of survival in this book.\n\u201cWords, you see,\" he said, looking at me again, \"allow us to make permanent what is essentially transient.

It takes place in Cambodia during the reign of the Khmer Rouge. Born in Phnom Penh, the author\u2019s father was a member of nobility and an intellectual. While they questioned the inequity of their culture, the coup of 1970 developed into an equally corrupt system. People were forced into labor camps, starved and executed. Families separated. The vision of a socialist utopia had turned in to a form of genocide. Anyone perceived as an enemy of the state was systematically removed. Overthrown by the Vietnamese in 1979, an estimated third of the population had died. Vaddey Ratner worked such a significant number of parallels into her novel that in my humble opinion it is more a memoir. She suffered from polio and lost her father among other things. Without giving away the story, a reader should be prepared for the brutality and loss. The main character Raami survives in part through the transforming nature of her father\u2019s poetry and stories. And Ratner\u2019s writing is as lyrical and laden with metaphors. When her father\u2019s royal status is discovered, he basically sacrifices himself to their captors.

The family who lived underneath me had a little girl about Raami\u2019s age. I remember with horror the stories they told about losing all they owned in the revolution, the forced labor, the beatings, escaping through the rice paddies at night, threats of cutting off fingers when the Khmer Rouge couldn\u2019t get rings off, months and years in refugee camps.

Through her eyes Vaddey Ratner displays the evocative environment of Cambodia as it is torn asunder by the Khmer Rogue. Raami and her family are forced out of their home and into a world of brutal labor and starvation. She fights to survive, even as she loses her family members one by one.As one might expect when reading a book about Auschwitz or the Holocaust, getting through Ratner's work was a painful trial due to the extent of human suffering portrayed. While Raami's narrative could be a bit dry at times, it never falters, taking into account all the details and stories one would expect from a child. That this book acts almost as the author's account of her own childhood in Cambodia makes it even more touching and bittersweet.Overall I recommend this book for those interested in a story of human sorrow, hope, and beauty, all delineated through the perspective of an insightful and honest seven-year-old girl.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4148831-karen", "userReview": "I visited Siem Reap as part of a 3 week trip to Southeast Asia in April 2012.

From 1975-1979, the country's people endured incomprehensible horror and systematic genocide. 1975 is no longer- the revolutionaries have declared it Year Zero. When Raami and her family are ousted from their home, they begin the trek which will take them on a journey of wrenching agony and tears. This first uprooting will be the first among many in which they will lose family, friends and belongings. Each 'leaving' is a leaving of love, of memories-the things that tie them to their past.Raami has grown up in a family of privilege, of royal lineage and she has this very close bond with her father who is a just, caring, gentle man. He tells her stories and teaches her about the beauty of the natural world. He tells Raami that the reason he told her so many stories was: \"to give you wings\". He tells her that his greatest desire is to see her live. \"When I lie buried beneath this earth, you will fly. For me Raami.

It is these words that give her the will to go on.The story is heartbreaking and painful but the authors ability to intersperse beauty amidst the horror allows the reader to continue reading what would otherwise be unbearable. It is a testament to Vaddy Ratner's inner strength and resilience that she has written a story that requires her to re-live this period of her life so that her family's struggle, as well as all those who also endured might live on. she is their voice.She has written a beautiful, haunting novel that will not, nor should be, soon forgotten."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "The killing fields of Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge in power from 1975-1979 before the Vietnamese drove them out, by this time one to two million Cambodians were either killed, starved to death or committed suicide.

Told entirely from the viewpoint of Raami, this book and the way it is told has a poignancy and yet a strange beauty too as it is not only about a horrible revolution but about the strong bond and love between a father and daughter. This is in fact the authors own story, though she was only 5 when the actual revolution happened, and as she explains in the afterward she writes this book to honor her father and those who never made it through this horrific time. This book is beautiful;y written, my only question is would a seven and eight yr. old have the capacity to relate all these things she had seen? I decided that what she did';t understand at the beginning, after everything she sees and experiences, she would have grown up relatively quickly so I think that this is entirely plausible.

Despite loss and starvation, forced labor and wanton cruelty, young Raami never gives up her belief in the power of stories to save us, the power of words as wings. One thought, and I wonder if any other readers had this reaction. I really enjoyed reading this book, although enjoyed is not quite the right word - more accurately, I appreciated reading it. But I kept wondering about the author's decision to tell the entire story from the first person point-of-view of a child. On the one hand, the child's innocence balances the horror of the facts. On the other hand, I craved a more layered perspective, a more complex telling. I kept wishing, odd as it may sound, for a glimpse into the inner world of one of the Khmer Rouge \"organization\" believers.

Each of the three books was about a young girl who, with their families, suffered under the Khmer Rouge communist regime and their genocide campaign. The Khmer Rouge took control of Phnom Penh, its last obstacle to ruling all of Cambodia, on April 17th, 1975. They turned the cities into ghost towns, evacuating or killing the city dwellers and forcing their populations into the countryside. They nullified the monetary system, making them all destitute. And systematically executed all those in the former government and military, the teachers, the doctors, the religious leaders, and any they viewed as intellectuals...sometimes just because they wore glasses. All this was done to satisfy Pol Pot's dream of turning Cambodia into an agrarian state isolated from Western influence. But, this was just the beginning of the Khmer Rouge atrocities. When the country was liberated from the regime in January of 1979, an estimated 2 million Cambodians had suffered death under the regime. Almost an entire nation was orphaned. Both First They Killed My Father by Loung Ung and When Glass Floats by Chanrithy Him are autobiographical. In the Shadow of the Banyan was such a different reading experience from the other two because it was a novel steeped in poetic prose. The protagonist, Raami, is still based on the author and Raami's struggles mirror the struggles of Ratner but the novel format allowed Ratner to tell her story in a much different voice. \"Words, you see,\" he said, looking at me again, \"allow us to make permanent what is essentially transient. Turn a world filled with injustice and hurt into a place that is beautiful and lyrical. Even if only on paper.\" (pg 106) \"I told you stories to give you wings, Raami, so that you would never be trapped by anything - your name, your title, the limits of your body, this world's suffering.\" (pg 134)If you are only going to read one of the three, I'd honestly read First They Killed My Father, but if you are going to read two or all three, I'd recommend reading this novel first. It is filled with Cambodian tradition and stories that will give you a sense of the spirit of this people before humanity was taken from them. Through this coming of age story, Raami was able to see the violence and suffering around her without losing her ability to find the words that would give her wings."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "It sends chills through me when I think about the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge when they gained control in Cambodia in 1975. Vaddey Ratner wrote a fictional story that was based on her family's actual experiences.Raami was a seven-year-old girl living a life of privilege as the daughter of a prince. Her father was a poet who loved telling her traditional fables, which emotionally helped her after she had polio as a one-year-old. Her father told Raami, \"When I thought you couldn't walk, I wanted to make sure you could fly.\"The story starts off slowly as it shows the family's life as royals. There was mass confusion when the Khmer Rouge came into power, and intellectuals and royals were marked for extermination. The Khmer Rouge forced people out of their homes. They were sent to work in the rice paddies, or off to dig earth and stones to form huge dams to hold back the water from the monsoons. The people were starved, tortured, and killed. The survivors were dealing with the grief of losing their loved ones. The story of Raami's family keeps picking up pace--and increasing in terror--until Raami is mute and near starvation before they finally escape.The author was only five-years-old in 1975, and she escaped into Thailand four years later with her mother. They arrived in the United States in 1981, and she became a high achieving student. Vaddey Ratner writes in a beautiful lyrical manner. It must have taken great courage to relive this experience in her mind as she was writing this book."}, {"userName": "Sonja Arlow", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow", "userReview": "This semi-autobiographical novel is based on the invasion of the Khmer Rough in Cambodia during the 1970\u2019s. Although it contains beautifully graphic descriptions of scenery and the Cambodian folklore I really struggled to connect with this book. The story was told mainly in metaphorical flowery prose by a narrator whose voice didn\u2019t ring true. No 7 year old child, no matter how precocious, could remember so much detail or draw such poignant connections and observations of her surroundings. Perhaps if the book was written in the form of an adult looking back it would have felt more authentic.I did however enjoy the Author's Note at the end of the book about her actual experience during this horrific time. It outlined what the Khmer Rouge occupation which made me understand the severity of the situation.I am still trying to figure out exactly why I did not enjoy this book (besides the issues I had about the narrator).

It's told from the perspective of 7 year old Rami, daughter of Cambodian prince Ayuravan Sisowath. Vaddey Ratner, the author, is the only child of Cambodian prince of the same name that survived Khmer Rouge imprisoment. To give the voice of the one that were lost during one of the most radical and savage social experiments in the world, she decided to do it through fiction instead of memoris, although ,as she explains in Author's note, Ramis experiences were in essence her own. Khmer Rouge were one of many gorilla groups that trouble young Cambodian democracy during the Vietnam war that was spreading though the border to Cambodia. They gained power and support in the country side with idealistic communist propaganda and under leadership of Pol Pot within 4 years they've killed 1/3 of its population. The writing flows and so the story. It's impossible to put the book down. If you are the ones that prefer to stay away from the books that offer too detailed description of genocide brutality, I can calm you down. Ratner gives only as much of brutality as absolutely necessary focusing rather on her characters strength to survive, family love than brutality. Rami and her family are marked. They are the enemy class. Rami, survives only due to her parents love, the stories of her father based on Buddhist religion and Buddhies/folk mythology help her to strive for survival while she suffers hard labor, starvation and is moved from place to place often spending days on her own. Those stories and Rami's mother strength to push forward to save the daughter, gave her life as Ratner, the author, herself noted, over and over again. The power of the story that Ratner believes in was one of the reasons she has written this great book for. It's one of the best I've read this year and I'm giving it 4,5 stars, not for literary reason, that are absolutely fine, but for the fact that it makes me want to explore the complicated history of this region more, Buddhist philosophy as well, and it reminded me about the power of the storytelling."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12769608-susan", "userReview": "4.5 stars.

Raami is consistently viewing the world through an adult's eyes, verbalizing observations that go well beyond a child's level of understanding. It's not that she necessarily realizes things that a child wouldn't be aware of, rather that she describes them so specifically, spelling them out for the reader. It's a tactic that is both condescending for a mature reader (who, were the scenes properly written, would be able to see everything through subtlety), but also completely and totally contradictory to Raami's age.Ratner has Raami describe and interpret EVERYTHING, which kills any possibility of subtlety (and further emphasizes the age discrepancy). It's clumsy writing. It is so focused on being richly written and vivid and beautiful, that it fails to scale the simplest heights. The novel is overwritten. It's overwritten for its narrator but it's also overwritten in that the sentences drag, creating overly elaborate imagery that ultimately leads nowhere.The plot pacing is equally frustrating. The core story is fascinating - how could it not be? This is recent history displaying humanity at its worst. But beyond this core, it isn't particularly interesting. Ratner's tendency to overwrite means that this novel feels bloated and long. It didn't take too long for me to get tired of the many descriptions of this \"exotic\" locale, or talk of jasmine, and butterflies, and other repetitive descriptions used to give the story what I can only imagine was meant to be \"flavor\". I was supposed to feel attached to these characters, supposed to care about their lives and their world and their reality.

Raami is just seven-years-old when the novel begins, when the Khmer Rouge comes to power. The murderous regime over the course of four years was responsible for as many as two million deaths, wiping out about a third of the Cambodian population in their attempts to establish a communist utopia. The story is described in blurbs as \"lyrical.\" I thought at first too lyrical, bordering on purple, as Ratner paints an idyllic life among mangoes and butterflies and jasmine and the banyan tree, poetry and legends. It wasn't long before I was pulled in though; it occurs to me all that lush imagery isn't without its purpose--and not the one I thought at first. It's not so much that the golden world of her childhood is presented as a contrast to the horrors to come, as that it's a vision that sustains Raami through it. Raami's parents are especially strong characters. And the warmth lingers through much of the novel. I couldn't help comparing this in my mind to Wiesel's Night, the memoir of his time in Auschwitz when barely in his teens. That wasn't cloaked as this story is in fiction. But the main difference is that this story somehow escapes its bleakness, despite the at times graphic brutality. Hope and faith even to the end shines through. It's not as powerful as Night, and the voice did strike me as a bit too sophisticated for such a young child, but this is still a moving story and very evocative of time and place with characters to care about."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802440-cynthia", "userReview": "Ratner\u2019s use of language and imagery is exquisite.

I\u2019m sure most people are aware that during the mid 70\u2019s these communists took power and subjugated their fellow Cambodians.

Along with their country people, Raami and her immediate and extended family\u2019s homes were destroyed, they were kidnapped, and then hustled from one place to another, and from one back breaking manual labor task to another.

I'm honestly not sure who the intended audience is for this book.
