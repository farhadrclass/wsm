But it was worth it.Melina Marchetta never fails to remind me why she is one of my favourite authors and, in my opinion, this is the best of her books I've read so far. It's very difficult to put into words how I feel about On the Jellicoe Road, all I can say is that my heart has been ripped out and shredded, my throat has sealed up with emotion and when I finally get some sleep, I get the feeling I'll probably dream about Jonah Griggs.The story is of Taylor Markham, a girl who was abandoned by her mother as a young child and now resides in a boarding school for kids who are troubled, neglected or criminally inclined, her closest friend and mentor being Hannah, a woman who lives on the edge of the school grounds. Taylor is elected as a leader in the territory war games played by her school with the Townies (locals) and Cadets. She tries to balance this responsibility with her own worries about Hannah's sudden disappearance and her belief that it is connected to her own mother. On top of that is Jonah Griggs, one of the Cadets and a boy from her past, who knows her a little too much for comfort.The biggest concern of mine is that the intended young adult audience may not fully appreciate Melina Marchetta, I know she's somewhat of a celebrity here on goodreads but she's hardly a household name... and it irks me. I want to tell everyone to read this, scream praise from rooftops, and glare with disapproval at the teens in my local library until they drop Halo and pick up these fantastic works of fiction. But it makes me sad that Melina Marchetta is probably too sophisticated a writer for the Twilight generation.Saving Francesca, The Piper's Son, On the Jellicoe Road... every book I read seems better than the last. She creates moods that permeate the entire book so even the most simplistic scenes or conversations become deeply emotional, and Melina Marchetta plays my emotions like Jimi Hendrix played guitar. I can't think of a single book that has had me choked up more often than this one.And Jonah Griggs, you stole my heart. Though I do think Melina Marchetta could quite easily persuade me to fall in love with a goldfish. Basically this book is everything... beautiful, powerful, tragic without being melodramatic, and I know this wonderfully sad story will stay with me for a very long time."}, {"userName": "Lora", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4632071-lora", "userReview": "There's a reason why books like Twilight don't receive those. They don't give those to just any book, and when you factor in excellence . . . well, a lot of titles just don't make the cut. But it is clear to me why Melina Marchetta's third tribute to YA literature received a Printz award back in 2009. It is because it is excellent, to the very meaning of the word.If all YA contemporary writers wrote like Marchetta, I doubt I'd play in any other genre playground very often. She writes these beautifully inspirational, relatable, and emotionally-charged novels that seem to affect me in an undescribable way. Some of the passages in Jellicoe Road seem to beat with their own heart:\"These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.\"\"'What do you want from me?' he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More.\"I've always believed that an exceptionally good writer can take you places emotionally that others can't, and, for me, Melina Marchetta is one of those writers. I'm going to end this review here for two reasons: 1) I believe this is the type of book that should be experienced first hand, without much knowledge of the story going in. So, go read it and remember, the beginning is confusing, but plow through it and I promise you won't regret it; 2) I'm tearing up thinking about this story and its characters, so all you'll be getting from me is the aforesaid and this: I love this book and I'm anticipating the day when I can read it again. I highly recommend Jellicoe Road to everyone.Oh, and one more thing: I \u2665 Jonah Griggs."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "[and can i just say how my heart went out to jude, who was so like my beloved jude the obscure - who just wanted so badly to be let into christminster/the tragic bond the other kids had forged on the old jellicoe road?? i mean, he ended up better than hardy's jude, but still - the yearning!! you have my heart, jude.

But not every will love this book. I will also preface this review by saying that you shouldn't decide whether you belong in group A or group B before you get to page 125 or so. The first 125 pages are a confusing, emotional slog that seems to be about territorial \"wars\" between rival teen sects in Australia. But it's really brilliantly done -- because that is exactly what the main character, Taylor Markham, thinks of things. It's busy and there are plot threads everywhere and all I knew was that I loved SAVING FRANCESCA and Melina Marchetta was doing all of this for a reason. And she was. It ties up beautifully in the end, and there's a scene which even made me shed a tear -- me, who has not cried since THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (three tears) and while writing my second novel SHIVER (one tear from each eye) -- and I'm left feeling just about cheerful about everything in the book though it was not a Hollywood happy ending by any stretch. I think quite possibly my absolute favorite thing that Marchetta does is the character reversal. She introduces a character which we view in a terrible light because the main character views them in a terrible light, and then she completely changes our mind about them in a subtle and realistic way throughout the book until finally we and the main character are in love. She did this in SAVING FRANCESCA and she pulled it off again in JELLICOE ROAD even though I was watching for it. By the time we get the first kiss in the novel, I was sort of clapping embarrassingly like a seal. This is one of those books that I know will be wonderful on the reread, because I'll get to look past the busy beginning to see the groundwork Marchetta was laying. Happy sigh. I'm very happy this one won the Printz this year.***wondering why all my reviews are five stars? Because I'm only reviewing my favorite books -- not every book I read. Consider a novel's presence on my Goodreads bookshelf as a hearty endorsement. I can't believe I just said \"hearty.\" It sounds like a stew.****"}, {"userName": "Kristin (KC) - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4971692-kristin-kc---traveling-sister", "userReview": "*5+ Stars! Gorgeous*Books like this make me realize just how insignificant words become when attempting to convey raw emotion. On the Jellicoe Road is more than just a book; it is a hauntingly beautiful journey towards an unexpected destination where tragedy and despair become the bridges to the greatest of friendships.\u00a0\n\nAnd life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.\n\nThis story is told in alternating perspectives set in both past and present which, at first, seem entirely unrelated. But as the mysteries of this plot unravel, they begin to show hints of their glorious connection. If you find yourself confused or frustrated at first, don't give up - you are strategically been fed only pieces to a larger puzzle that will all fit together nicely in the end.\u00a0The character development in this story is extraordinary; no one is denied the sweetness of redemption and transformation. Seventeen year old Taylor Markham has been living on the Jellicoe Road after being abandoned by her mother at a local 7-11. The school she attends partakes in traditional games of territory wars where Taylor eventually becomes a leader. Taylor is tormented by the grief and uncertainty of her abandonment and keeps herself emotionally distant from others. She has few memories of her childhood, but when her history starts presenting itself she begins a relentless quest for answers.\u00a0The writing in this story is captivating as it flows methodically from one vivid scene to the next. Taylor's character, as broken as she appears, is actually quite funny in a dry and witty, sarcastic sense - which is my favorite type of humor. I appreciated being able to smile and laugh in the midst of such angst-ridden scenarios. Taylor's love interest, Jonah, is equally damaged and initially comes across as arrogant and crude. But, as their gentle relationship develops, it not only becomes one of the most loving but also one of the most inspiring.\u00a0\n\nBeing part of him isn't just anything. It's kind of everything.\n\n Every single element and occurrence in this book is connected to some larger piece of the story. Everything. Most connections are prominent enough to take your breath away, but then there are those as subtle as whispers, and if you're not careful enough you just may miss them. I was still connecting the dots even after the book was done. The way this author seamlessly executes this perfect union of all that exists though past and present is truly astonishing.\u00a0Touching messages of hope, love, and determination tugged at me endlessly while reading this book. This story brought me to tears - from being just so deeply moved and so humbly inspired.\u00a0\n\n\"Hold my hand because I might disappear.\"\n\n\n\nBook Stats:\n\u25aa\t Genre/Category: Young Adult\u25aa\t Steam: Clean\u25aa Romance: Beautiful love story involved, but not sole focus. \u25aa\t Characters: Complex, well-developed, lovable. \u25aa\t Plot: Uniquely focused on tragic events forming powerful friendships.

Normally these are the books that either horrify me (Unwind, The Handmaid's Tale) or delight me with superb writing (The Queen of Attolia, The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks) or awe me with imaginative world building (The Left Hand of Darkness) or make me cry (Before I Die). Jellicoe Road definitely falls into this last \"made-me-weep\" category.Jellicoe Road is the location of a boarding school for kids that are often neglected or with criminal tendencies. Taylor Markham is residing in the school because her mother had abandoned her at the age of 11 at a nearby 7-Eleven. Now Taylor is 17 and unexpectedly selected to be the school's leader in the game of territory wars with the Townies (locals from a tiny neighboring town) and Cadets (who spend several weeks a year in the Australian wilderness). Taylor is not sure she can handle the responsibility. She is uneasy more than ever - her mentor and friend Hannah disappears and Taylor is sure it has something to do with her mother; Jonah Griggs, a Cadet who she has a shared past with, is back and seems to know her all too well; she is plagued by dreams of a young boy who attempts to tell her something. What follows is Taylor's journey through the past and present to uncover the reasons why and how she was abandoned by her mother. As always, it is hard for me to explain what I like about a 5-star book, but I'll try. Melina Marchetta draws characters that are deep, complex, and real. The relationships among them are touching - more than anything I think, this book is about the power of friendship and, boy, there are some magnificent examples of friendship in this book! The book is also about grief, guilt, forgiveness and, of course, love.If I am forced to point out any flaws in this book, I'd say the writing some might find confusing in the beginning. It takes a few pages to figure out what is a dream and what is a page from a story Taylor is reading; what is from present and what is from the past. But soon enough all pieces of the puzzle fall together and you are faced with a deep, meaningful and heartbreaking story. Another thing that might bother readers is that some characters go through a lot of tragic events, sometimes too many. However, the story never becomes overly melodramatic or emotionally manipulative IMO. Jellicoe Road is a remarkable work of YA fiction and rightfully deserves the Printz award it was given in 2009. I have no doubt I will read Marchetta's books in future."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "'On the Jellicoe Road' is the first book I've read/listened to by this author. After all of the glowing reviews for this one, I was prepared to be blown away. Unfortunately, it just didn't work out that way for me. It ended up being an \"okay\" story for me.My first problem has less to do with the actual story, and more to do with the format that I chose. I listened to the Audible edition and that was a big mistake. The problem didn't stem from the quality of narration, so much as the complexity of the story. There were simply too many moving parts for me to try and keep track of while listening to an audiobook. It is incredibly hard to pull off a book like this in audiobook format and it didn't work for me.I spent hours trying to figure out who the characters were and what the hell was going on. The transitions between characters and time frames was not always obvious, making matters even worse. I must have been hours into the story before I figured out that there were actually two stories playing out -- one in the present and one in the past. Needless to say, I lost a lot of time being utterly confused and unaware of what was going on. By the time I began to piece some things together, I had already missed so many of the \"connections\" and details that it was kind of pointless. When the big reveals came toward the end, they were kind of meaningless to me. I never really connected with the characters or the storyline. I had simply missed too much to play catch-up at that point.The story centers on Taylor Markham, a girl that was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road by her mother at the age of 11. She lives at a boarding school (orphanage???). When the lady that has taken care of her disappears, she is certain that something is amiss. Taylor sets out to find Hannah, or discover what really happened to her. When she runs across a book/journal written by Hannah, she begins to unveil some long-standing secrets. Along with some friends from her school, she has several creepy encounters and a variety of adventures. There is some sort of rivalry described between the two groups of kids...but I was pretty confused so I can't say I ever really grasped what that was about for sure.Overall, this ended up being a middle of the road story for me. I do suspect that I'm not doing this story justice though. I was just too lost for most of the book to take much away from the experience this time around. I do plan to re-read this in the future, because I have some lingering questions. I'm sure they were answered along the way and I just didn't catch it. I definitely won't be listening to the audiobook on my second attempt. This story will require my full attention.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com"}, {"userName": "Nataliya", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya", "userReview": "[unprotected sex?

It's not like I hadn't already started to pin the pieces of the puzzle early on for myself. It's the sheer beauty and mastery with which Miss Marchetta constructs this tiny little world and its complex characters who don't feel like characters at all because that's how deep in you are. It's that constant air of enigma and enchantment, that underlying presence of hope mixed with tragedy that draws you in so very thoroughly; all presented without the need for tasteless dramatics, maudlin behavior or overattention to romance.When you can manage making my heart feel so passionately for a person who only exists in whisps of memories throughout the entire course of a novel, I salute you. To me, reading this book felt like a \njourney\n. An experience in and of itself. And quite frankly, the first time, in a long time, that I've been taken away to that far away place we all go to with the simple power of words.Word of advice\u2014 suitably apt mood music will make reading this endlessly more exhilarating.

This book. -----Note: I\u2019m not sure where the words \u2018On the\u2019 went\u2026 I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s different for the British version and not that I have a defective copy.Also\u2026 while I\u2019m Note-ing: This review will be a lot shorter than other reviews because this book is best read knowing nothing about it. Initial Final Page Thoughts.Breathtaking. I need to listen to the masses more. High Points.JONAH GRIGGS. Sorry, had to get that out there. Taylor Markham= New Soul Sister. Australia. Mystery! Nostalgia. Childhood games. Raff. Beautiful writing. Amazing character development. Heartbreakingly perfect ending. Low Points.When I read books (real books, not Kindle ones because they have the nifty \u2018Add Notes/Highlights\u2019 button) I have a pink polka dot notebook that I jot down page numbers, thoughts and quotes in. I know that\u2019s not a radical thing to do because I know a lot of people who do similar things, and as I read this novel I found myself writing down questions that I believed would be answered at the end. Most of them were and everything made sense, but there were two questions that I had that I really wanted to know the answers to. The answers wouldn't really add anything to the story... I'm just nosey.Not that I\u2019m hankering after a sequel because this book was perfect on its own and I think a sequel would be pointless, but I feel like I need to sit Ms Marchetta down and ask her my questions just for some closure. So, if you\u2019re ever in Manchester MM, there\u2019s a caffeinated drink on me!Heroine.I loved loved loved Taylor Markham and from the first page I knew that she was going to be a part of the League of Soul Sisters (along with Vera, Katniss (don\u2019t mention Mockingjay), Viola and The Rat) that I am considering setting up.I\u2019m going to be the \u2018funny one\u2019 in this group, obviously, because I lack the coolness, wit, feistiness and the ability to throw a ball in a straight line never mind shoot an arrow. Taylor was the perfect mix of disgruntled moody teenager, spunky heroine and confused young girl. Yes, she can teeter on the edge of being a bitch but I think that\u2019s what I liked about her. She\u2019s flawed and she\u2019s normal and she\u2019s trying to deal with so much I practically encouraged her to be a bit prickly. YA fiction is so full of impossibly perfect heroines that make it so hard to relate to. But I really related to Taylor and her outlook on life and in the time it took me to read this book, I found myself really caring about what happened to her. And I think that\u2019s why a lot of people really love this book. So yeah, Taylor, keep your eye out for the postman because there's an official invitation in the post for you...Love Interest.Oh Jonah. When I heard you described by many a girl as the mysterious loner with a dark and tortured past, I have to admit that alarm bells were going off.There\u2019s something about the word \u2018mysterious\u2019 and 'loner' when used to describing boys that triggers an alarming adverse reaction in me (lots of frowning, yawning, skipping of pages, eye-rolling, eye-clawing-out etc).But you, Jonah Griggs, you are my kind of guy and you are allowed your dark and tortured past. I don\u2019t want to say a lot on this subject because if you haven\u2019t read it already then you need to experience JG first hand. But this guy brings the swoon and I have to agree with Taylor on one thing (well, on most things, but this one in particular)\u2026 I prefer him in his fatigues. BOOM.Also an honourable mention has to go to Santangelo, with his abs (don\u2019t worry Taylor, I wouldn\u2019t look away either) and Ben, my violinist and his medieval jousting. Hot damn. Theme Tune.Local Boy in the Photograph - Stereophonics. I immediately thought of this song... not just the subject matter but the whole message of the lyrics. Bitter sweet. Angst Scale.9/10. I really don\u2019t want to say anything in this department for fear of spoiling things. But my favourite part of this book was the way past events were interwoven with the present day and how they affected the characters. I found these passages that were filled with innocence, hope, lost youth, impossible situations and, most importantly, the power of best friends so beautiful and captivating. Recommended For.EVERYONE. People who love mystery books. People who are comfortable with having butterflies in their stomach permanent because when JG brings the swoon\u2026 sorry, I\u2019ll stop. People who like kick-ass, resourceful and perfectly complex heroines. People who love beautifully written and fantastically paced prose.

Quite possibly, my favorite book of the year, because it is so unique and so gut-wrenching and so enrapturing it deserves the title. This book is not merely a reading experience; this book is a journey. One filled with two emotional plotlines, past and present, that overlap in places only to thread themselves together in a masterful and sad, yet agonizingly beautiful story. \nThis book is about finding yourself. About hating the world and cursing the universe for forcing you to exist when you're left abandoned by everyone else. About your whole life being a question mark. And about finally opening up to the world and embracing it to the fullest. \n\u201cHold my hand because I might disappear.\u201d\nThis book is about love, every kind of love. The one between siblings. The one that's so intense it's everything to you and leaves you dying when that love suddenly stops. The one that's as natural as breathing. The one that you try to bury beneath excuses. And about the love for life, for living, despite it continuously trying to shove you down. \n\u201cIt's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\u201d\nThis book is about the ugliness of humanity. About serial killers. About drug addiction. About neglected children. About pedophilia and child pornography. About goddamn cancer. About abuse. About suicide. About car accidents. About being parentless. About loss and about death. \n\u201cIs a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?\u201d\nBut, I believe, most importantly, this book is about friendships. I cannot find the words to describe how amazing the friendships portrayed in this novel are. They just filled me up with immense joy and plastered smiles on my face and gave me a sense of family. With their banter, their bromance, their love for mischief, their leadership, their honesty, their support for one another and their endless, boundless, eternal love. \nAlso, this book is about clever and magical storytelling. About how an author can enthrall you with some words on a page and make you cry like you lost someone dear to you. About how she can twist your heart and make you curse out loud for (fictional) live being so unfair. About how she can give you goosebumps and butterflies in your stomach and sighs and accelerated heartbeats. And this book is about me and how I have fallen in love with its every single character. I love Taylor. I love Jonah. I love Santangelo. I love Raffy. I love Ben. I love Jessa. I love Trini. I even love Chloe P. and Richard and Sam. And I adore Webb and Narnie and Tate and Fitz and Jude. They were the backbone of this book, its essence, its soul. And oh, Fitz, I just want to hug the poor precious boy. And oh, Narnie, I just want to destroy her numbness.And oh, Tate, I just want to hold her hand and be there for her.And oh, Jude, I just want to save him from the heartache. And oh, Webb, I just want to place him in the sky between the stars where he belongs because he is perfection. After I finished reading at 5AM, I kept asking myself: Why haven't I read this sooner? How much can a single person cry in one night? How much can you love a book? What to do with my life now? And so here I am, begging you to read this book if you haven't done so yet. Let it be a journey for you. \n\u201cYou just have to belong.

Just like how the individual colors may look beautiful in a certain particular nuance but as a whole the rainbow emanates probity and pulchritude like a contented sigh from the firmament.You know that moment when you just sit there staring at off nothing and thinking of everything, sometimes at night when you can't sleep ?That's what it was with me, those few times, with my iPad on my lap,\n not quite a respite but a reprieve from the maelstrom of emotions that rose from the book.\nBut not quite a reprieve either.As for the characters and the writing, it's, Melina Marchetta. Need I say anything more ?Lemme get one thing clear, The story is confusing for the first half. It takes time to get into the story and may make one feel perfunctory and slightly out of the loop, like you know, visiting your old friends and seeing them together, talking about things they share and you no longer do.Like that. But if you cop out because of it, it just shows that you don't deserve this story. It's not yours. And I'm on cloud nine right now that I'm not one of them.But then, it is \nhaunting\n in the second, not the ghastly kind of haunting, \nthe sinuous kind of haunting that follows you, enervates you and makes you forget that time and the rest of the world exist.\nWhen the obfuscated truth hits you squarely on the chest at the end, that feeling is devastating. Devastatingly beautiful.Breathtakingly beautiful.Achingly  Beautiful.Beautiful.Just like that.You might be wondering why I'm so profound and poetic ? Because that's the only way I can do justice to my thoughts, to my feelings and most importantly, this book."}, {"userName": "Stacia (the 2010 club)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4013351-stacia-the-2010-club", "userReview": "Simply incredible. I cried way too much, but it was so worth it. Will review tomorrow when I can wrap my head around what to write.*moves ahead a day in time*After sleeping on it, I'm still struggling with how to write a proper review. There are some books which are virtually impossible to explain, and this is one of them. The GR book summary gives no indication what the book is really about, and truth be told, I'm not sure you'd want to know what the book is about before reading it.The first 150 pages or so are completely frustrating and confusing. I knew this ahead of time, but I also knew that just about every single person who has read this has said the exact same thing, yet still gave the book 5 stars. There is a reason for this. The first part of the book is only giving you glimpses of the player's lives and their world. It almost reminded me of one of those movies that you watch in reverse, where the ending is the beginning and the beginning is the end - yet not quite. All I can do is echo the voices of those who prodded me to read the book - DON'T GIVE UP. You will not forget this book. You will not regret reading. It is so worth the read. Keep some tissues handy.As the story unfolds, the author starts giving us a crumb of information, then another, then another. Slowly the pieces of a broken story come together as one revelation follows another in a wave - a very emotional wave at that. Just when you think you've heard it all, more starts to come. Then more, then more. Pay attention to every single character. Just about every person's life is intertwined with the other characters in this story.I'm done trying to prod you to read this. Just read it. You will not be sorry for making the effort. Please, I beg you...battle through the first part of the book (which is confusing) until you get to the part that starts to get into your soul. Let's call this a dare. I have yet to find one person who did not love this book."}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "You gut me, Marchetta.

Completely, totally fucked up. Everybody in it is fucked up, and living their lives is fucked up, and by the time you're done with it, you're fucked up, but you can't tell because your head is cloudy from all the tears you've shed getting through this fucked-up book. I hate On The Jellicoe Road. I hate books that make me cry, and this book made me want to weep tears of blood for all that lost youth and promise, and the pain of loss and the promise of the future. If somebody had told me how mixed-up and emotional this book was going to make me feel, I would have abandoned it in a corner and floated off to the simple uncomplicated world of supernatural ass-kicking, where nobody dies and even if they do, they rarely stay dead. In the big debate of Saving Francesca versus Jellicoe Road, I would have to pick Jellicoe Road. I liked Francesca better, but that's because it made me laugh and think and smile mistily, but it never, ever, shoved me into the wringer and brought me out feeling like a limp dishcloth. It never made me feel that piercing tender pain you get when you think of things long past that can never be regained. It never made me feel like I was drowning in the lives of people who are so real, it's hard to believe they don't exist and haven't consumed your life. Jellicoe Road is a harsher, deeper read, the sandpaper to Francesca's paint peeler. Undeniably, the writing is brilliant. It's evocative and tender, it makes the emotions in each page almost tangible. The characters are drawn brilliantly too, and despite the fact that over half of the main cast wants to kill themselves at one point or the other, you cannot help but be drawn to them. I loved Taylor and Griggs and Santangelo and Raffy, but my heart got well and truly tangled up with Narnie and Webb and Judd and Tate and Fitz. It's for them that my heart broke, and shattered into a million pieces. The story is told largely from the perspective of Taylor, but it is the ghosts that predominate, that breathe life into the story, ironic as that sounds. This is not a book for people who want a straightforward love story with a dash of drama. This is for people who want to appreciate good writing, and don't mind losing a little bit of themselves between the covers of a book in the process. Oh man, this book is just so seriously Fucked. Up. And I would so totally KILL anyone who dissed it.

I counted.\nReading one of Marchetta\u2019s stories should be one of the \u201c10 things to do in your lifetime\u201d. Seriously, this woman is one of the most creative people alive, one of the most amazing writers I came across and I wish I could put into words the awesomeness of this book, but I feel at a loss for words once more.In fact, I should invent a new language with a dictionary full of ways to praise her talent.Because Melina Marchetta doesn\u2019t only write books, she creates entire worlds full of fleshed-out characters and shattering emotions, and after you read about them you feel like you\u2019re the luckiest person in the known Universe and beyond. Because not many people in this world are able to feel what she makes you feel, and not many authors get to create such strong connections between the characters and the reader.I feel like her stories have a soul. Like her characters are living beings trappend into a fantasy world, waiting for us to come and listen to their stories. They seem to breathe through our emotions, and I don\u2019t remember a moment when I didn\u2019t feel something (deep) towards this story and these wonderful characters.Her words sing to me, they reach into the deep core of my own soul, they make me laugh through tears, they break my heart into thousand pieces but they also put it back in together, making it beat in a whole new rhythm, making it love and ache on a different level.Once again, the complexity of the plot left me lightheaded, in awe, even though I knew what was coming my way. It\u2019s been a while since the last time I read this book and I felt it all all over again: the confusion, the despair, the hope, the heartbreak, the happiness. My teary eyes could barely read and I was left breathless too many times to count. I loved EVERYTHING about this book, after all this time it is still my favorite story and I really hope that when (and if) you read this book you will be able to feel just a tiny-tiny part off all these blissful emotions flowing through my heart right now.\nTHE STORY:How much heartbreak can a heart take?Jellicoe road is a roller coaster, a story meant to break hearts \u2013 one about true friendship and love, about forgiveness and salvation, about hope and disappointment, about life and death and everything in between.It simply left me in awe again because there is no tiny detail, there is nothing less important in this story. Everything has value, all words have power \u2013 to make you laugh or cry, to dream and hope.. and the real beauty of it is connecting all the threads in this fabulous piece of art.But as heartbreaking and intense as it might be, it is also fun, and I found myself smiling more than once. So don\u2019t go thinking that this is a depressing book, it is not; it has the perfect balance between joy and sadness, between delight and heartbreak \u2013 but don\u2019t believe me, see it for yourself!THE CHARACTERS:I can\u2019t put into words how much compassion I felt towards the characters in this story. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one that didn\u2019t leave an impression on me. Some times they made me laugh (even through tears), some other I just wanted to hold them close to my heart and protect them from all the hurt in their lives.\nCONCLUSION:Every time I read \u201cOn the Jellicoe Road\u201d it simply takes my breath away.I fall in love with this book all over again, it hits me full strength no matter how well I think I know the story, it makes me smile and cry and sometimes both in the same time, all while I get drunk on the beauty of Marchetta\u2019s words.

You find that reading it a second time offers you a whole other reading experience. Those once slow 100 pages now whiz you by, and you realise it was not the pace that was at fault, but your confusion.You savour it so much more. Make sense of certain references - crush on the plot, characters and writing, and fall in love with Jonah Griggs all over again.It frustrates me so much to know that I can never do this book justice. That so many readers out there have yet to read this beauty. The thing is, somehow, even though I knew what was going to happen, I choked up and laughed like a mad women at the exact same scenes I did the first time around. What made me smile at times was how the little tissues were still there. So many times I would be about to bookmark a certain moment only to realise that it was already bookmarked. I suppose I know myself too well ;)When I approached the last 100 pages I decided to read them outside in the garden. I have never had that urge before, but It was dark outside, silent and soothing in a way that I couldn't imagine it being inside. It felt right to read those last pages alone - in a peaceful surrounding. Yet, like last time, I dreaded that last page, and when it had ended - I closed the book and just allowed my thoughts to take over and savour them, because I knew it would be a long time before any other book would ever make me feel like this again. I took that moment to mourn characters and a world I genuinely felt I had lost - taking some solace in the fact that I would return to them when the feeling of loss became close to unbearable.You know, I can see myself reading this every year, discovering something new every time, loving the characters even more - if that's even possible.Once again I was left with this undeniable ache that made me want to be a part of these characters lives, but I think what bothered me the most, and what really made me feel somewhat of a loss, was knowing that I will never know a Tate, Hannah, Webb, Jude, Fitz, Jonah, Ben, Raffy, Chaz, Jessa, and Taylor. I feel like I'm saying goodbye to something personal every time I turn over that last page, but now I know that's hardly the case.

I started reading this book last week, but I was in a horrible slump, and apparently this book is not the best book to read during one. So, I stopped reading it for a few days while I fixed my slump.

This book, Jellicoe Road by an Australian novelist, Melina Marchetta is our book of the month and we will have our face-to-face book discussion on Saturday. As a moderator and one of the senior members of the group, some members ask me what I think of the book. Even if they don't say or admit it, my views influence some of them. At this point, I guess my job is to encourage them to read the book and join the actual book discussion. That's why even if I did not like this book, I cannot rate this with 1 star. Why I did not like this book?1. I cannot understand why the first 100 pages should be made confusing2. The claim or fight for territory has nothing to do with the rest of the book. Also, I do not understand exactly how it is supposed to work.3. The love affair between Taylor and Briggs is too mushy for my taste. Felt like Katniss-Peeta or Bella-Edward. I'm too old for that.4. Taylor is a pathetic female character IMO.5. Taylor is asked to lead even if she is asthmatic. Is there nobody else who can lead?Anyway, according to my trusted friends in this group, the book is amazing. Maybe they are still young and the story \"speaks\" to them. So, let's leave it at that. However, I can say that this book has a good intent. It also has a developed story that other readers can emphatize with. I guess that this is just not for me. But it is my ardent desire that this book will influence our North Korean friend to back off in his evil plan of building nuclear arsenal in the side of the world. Stop your expansionist plan, please and be content on what you have. Then if you have to test nukes, please don't point it to the Philippines! See, we also love Melina Marchetta!

It's a Cybil's Finalist and a ALA Printz Award Winner. So people LOVE Jellicoe Road and I usually follow popular librarian opinion, but I just can't get on this bandwagon.I felt like the writing was very, very confusing. For the first 100 pages I really couldn't tell what was going on. Don't get me wrong - dramatic and interesting things were happening, but I couldn't even begin to see how they were related. The character development is very spread out and most of the characters do not become clear until the end.There are two plot lines -1 - Taylor's life at Jellicoe School - The school has tradition of playing war games with the local townies and the cadets of a military school. They fight over territories, trails, and clubhouses. They take it very seriously, but it\u2019s mostly in good fun. Taylor is the student leader of the Jellicoe School (like head girl - very big responsibility), but the school is made up of 6 houses and all of the houses have leaders too and they must collaborate to wage war against the townies and cadets.2 - Taylor's life before Jellicoe School \u2013 Taylor\u2019s father has been killed and her mother is an abandoning drug addict. Taylor has no family to speak of but is taken care of by a local woman named Hannah. Hannah is writing a book about the goings on of Jellicoe School when she attended and Taylor is using the book to piece together her own random memories to understand what her life was actually about \u2013 mainly the story of her mother and father.In my opinion, these two plot lines do not mix. I didn\u2019t know when to take Taylor seriously or when she was in deep emotional distress. One moment Taylor\u2019s reclaiming territory for the Jellicoe School and the next moment she\u2019s drowning a cat with her bare hands.There are very moving parts to this story. I felt for Taylor, Hannah, Griggs, & Jude, but everyone beyond that didn\u2019t touch me. They were just part of the confusion.Will someone please, please tell me what they LOVE about this book and what makes it a multiple award winner?

And boy, do I have a lot of gratitude that she pulled this book to the forefront of my TBR list.I'm gonna be honest, when I first started reading this I didn't find myself immediately drawn into the story. I was like that new kid in a group that's sort of hanging out on the edge of conversation, listening but not really participating.But then I saw the light.Things started to come together for me once Taylor began to pursue the truth of her past. But looking back, the beginning being on the slower side gave me a chance to get to know the characters and so I'm not going to say that it's a bad thing overall. It seems like the only other issue I had with this book could also be chalked up to personal preference and not something that's objectively wrong with the story. I just didn't love the setting of the Townies vs. Cadets vs. Students. Before things came into clearer focus I was thinking:\"What the fuck? People are actually getting hurt? These are school-aged kids? Whaaaat?\" But this setting does begin to feel much more appropriate once you get a bit further in.God, everyone in this novel was so intense.Once I started realizing what was going on, who was who, and why certain things were relevant... Damn. My heart was beating so fast while making these discoveries, and they are all individually and magnificently devastating.This is a book that slowly sinks its claws into you, and before you know it you're caught.

Each character has her or his own terrible past to come to terms with, and sometimes I wondered: How do these people manage to live on when even I almost can\u2019t cope with what they\u2019ve been through?

I had been DYING for it's release ~ and can still remember how tingly and giddy I felt as I walked home with my copy. Back then, I had 3 kids under 5 and couldn't wait for them to get in bed so I could curl up and savour my new Melina Marchetta.On The Jellicoe Road is notorious for people finding the beginning confusing ~ and I have seen lovers of the book urge people to persevere to find it's magic. It was not like that for me. From the first chapter ~ I was spellbound. I remember thinking it was beautiful and haunting and funny and so entirely utterly appealing ~ the prose and the mystery and the characters. I guess I did feel a little like: what is going on? But not in a distracting way. It was absorbing and engaging and mesmerising. And entirely unexpected.I LOVED how gorgeously chaotic the story initially felt. I knew NOTHING about it ~ I even wondered if Santangelo would be the love interest in the early days (which quickly flew from my mind as Jonah's (JONAH!) story started unravelling).I LOVE that I knew nothing about it. Not one review, not one opinion. I had my expectations of awesomeness (it was, after all, a Melina Marchetta and I had read (and re-read) her previous two books countless times. Reading it blindly was a stunning experience: I felt like the whole world was just me and the book. That the entire experience was mine. That no one had gone before me. That the story was for me and I was a part of the story. I still feel like that, in a way. I see others discovering it and loving it and I am SO proud of it (as if, somehow, it is mine, haha) ~ but a small part of me feels like it belongs uniquely to me. More to me than anyone else (I know this is a ridiculous sentiment, but I still feel it). I almost feel private about it ~ as if it has become a part of me and talking about is like letting others peek into my soul.That very first time: I read it all in one go. I was shattered and absorbed and breathless and incredulous. I fell in love with the characters and the prose and the setting. I still recall finishing the book and how I felt gutted and euphoric and in awe all at once. Too stunned to cry (even though it would have been lovely to weep), I lay in my bed for an hour, just thinking about it. And then ... I picked it up and started reading it from the beginning all over again. Since then, I have read it every year (sometimes more than once). It has never lost it's magic. It weaves itself deeper into me. It is my own personal cult book <3It seems ridiculous that I have not reviewed my favourite book of all time. I think I just feel entirely too inadequate to be up the the task. I also feel like it is such a part of me that I want to hold it close and not share it with the world. Yet another part of me feels like I could talk about it all day long and never tire of things to say and quotes to quote. This isn't a review, per se. It is me, humbly telling you, that 'On The Jellicoe Road' is my favourite book of all time. It is brilliant and hopeful and ache-y and truly soul-changing. It is the kind of chaotically gorgeous masterpiece that you only ever-so-rarely stumble across. It is perfect in it's brilliance. It radiates life and hope even as it is filled with grief and sorrow. It is everything,  everything , I love about reading, in such a way that it almost ruined me for other books ;) I am completely undone for it."}, {"userName": "Alienor \u2718 French Frowner \u2718", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31461418-alienor-french-frowner", "userReview": "\u2620 Territorial War buddy read/reread with Chelsea, Jennifer, Jen, Laura & Harriet \u2620What happens when you reread this incredible book?

Melina Marchetta's books show me something I was eager to learn, because even if I knew it deep down inside, I was seeking out the moment I'd unravel all my doubts : No, I'm not a cold-hearted reader. I was just longing for stories which really speak to me, because, never, ever again I want to find myself thinking 'oh, I think I'm supposed to cry right now'. The beauty of her books lies in the surprise they never fail to create in me : I could express it with a single word : suddenly.And that emergence of unexpected feelings? I live for that shit. \u2592  But this book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592Jellicoe road takes us into the life of characters so strongly convinced of the uselessness of their life that we want to fight for them. We want to tear the appearances out, and above all that, we're grateful to Melina Marchetta because her characters are so relatable and real that we can find pieces of ourselves in them. Pieces of our friends. Pieces of our family. Pieces of my heart that broke for Jonah Griggs over and over again. \n\"Please don\u2019t be crazy, Taylor,\u201d Griggs whispers, leaning his head against mine. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be crazy.\u201d He kisses me, holding my face between his hands, whispering over and over again, \u201cPlease\".\n Therefore don't worry if you're confused throughout the 100 first pages, I swear to you, there must surely come a stage when you'll find yourself utterly captivated by Taylor's journey. Moreover, after reading it a second time, I can assure you that this experience was even more emotional and that Marchetta wrapped her plot brilliantly - I noticed some things I couldn't see the first time and WOW. Just WOW. This structure? Incredible. Everything has a sense. Everything has a purpose. Nothing's useless. Nothing. \u2592  But this book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592This is a tale about where we belong. Is it a place? Is it a person? Is it love? Can we stop belonging somewhere? Can we earn the right to belong or is it something we have in our heart no matter what we do? Can we allow somebody else to be our everything? Because what happens, I'm asking I'm yelling, what happens if our everything disappears? *whisper* Do we disappear as well?Now, I don't want to scare you how that's too late? and I can assure you that Jellicoe Road isn't the kind of book that makes your eyes ache all long without never releasing the tension. No. That's just life, you know? So prepare yourself for a ride - you're going to laugh, to be pissed, to be desperate at times, to lose hope and then fight to find it again - You're going to live and feel and smile. \n\"Go on, admit it. When he hits the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?\"\n\u2592  But this book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592I don't want to talk about the plot. Damn, I just can't and I'll say only one thing : even if I guessed some parts of the mystery pretty fast, following Taylor and Jonah was an experience I'd have been sad to miss and that captivating and splendorous story will linger in my heart and in my thoughts for a very long time.\nYou know what you have to do.\n \n\"I reach the bottom and smash into him with my fists as hard as I can. He falls and I can't believe he goes down that easy, caught off balance.\"You care about nothing, you piece of shit!\"I'm on the verge of tears, like I always seem to be these days, and I hear the catch in my voice and I hate myself for it. He throws me off him and I can tell there is a fury in him.\"Never,\" he tells me in a tone full of ice, \"under-estimate who or what I care for.\u201d\nPS : I have a million quotes to write, a million stories about Jonah, Webbs, Tate, Narny, Jude, Fitz, Taylor, Jessa to tell. But I won't. I won't because this is a book which must be savored blind. I won't even if Jonah Griggs is certainly one of the characters I will never forget. Just meet them, and if that's already the case, go reread it. That's even better the second time around, trust me.

This beautifully heart aching novel did something to me I cannot explain. The truth is the beginning of the story kept confusing me that I almost wanted to quit reading. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t because if I had, I wouldn\u2019t have known of a wonderful though devastatingly painful but inspiring story of love, grief and friendship of two different generations but whose lives are intricately connected to one another.  The mystery behind the characters is also one great reason that kept me reading on, wanting to find out the connections among the characters.  The story also relates the different ways by which people process grief through the different characters and by reading the story, it was as if I was grieving with each character. Good thing, like any other process, grief too has an end or at least a point in which the person must move on and the story thankfully ends with the inspiring message of moving on and living and appreciating life the way those whom you\u2019ve lost would want you to."}], "description": "I'm dreaming of the boy in the tree.
