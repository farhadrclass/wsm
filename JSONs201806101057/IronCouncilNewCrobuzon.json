But I don't know if I've ever read one of his books before. Generally speaking though, people I respect enjoy his books, and that's the best way I know to find new things to read. Simply said? I really enjoyed it. Strange enough to be wondrous, but not so bizarre that it's nonsensical. Good story. Good use of language. Good characters. Perhaps more than anything else, I was impressed by the moral ambiguity of the book. And I'm not talking about cheap moral ambiguity, where characters disagree. Or there's some questions along the lines of \"was that the right thing to do?\" None of that weak tea here. This book was full of difficult situations and choices, and I can't think of another book I've read where so many people had radically different opinions about what the best course of action was. They disagreed, each took their own path, and and at the end of things, I still don't know who was right. What's more, the author pulled that off in such a way that it didn't feel fruitless and frustrating to me as a reader. My hat's off Mievile there, that's a *very* difficult balancing act. My only irritation was that I picked this book up without doing my usual research though. It's only now that I came to enter it into goodreads that I discover what I've fucked up and read the third book of the series. It speaks well of the book that that didn't keep me from enjoying the story or getting into the world. (Though it does explain the steeper-than-average learning curve at the beginning of the story.)"}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "Overtly political, teasingly intricate, and deeply intertextual, China Mi\u00e9ville's Iron Council is everything I expect to love in great speculative fiction, and nearly everything I know I love in Mi\u00e9ville's work.Yet, since its publication, I have only read it once, and I still find myself ranking it third of Mi\u00e9ville's Bas-Lag books. I've been baffled by my restraint with Iron Council. My admiration of Mi\u00e9ville's other books is boundless, bordering on madness, and I haven't understood how a book so filled with wonders -- Toro and its teleportation headdress, Judah's time-golem, the Iron Council train and its unparalleled mobility, Spiral Jacob and his Teshian machinations to overthrow New Crobuzon -- could keep me at such a distance -- until today. Today I recognized my problem with Iron Council (I am making my way through The Scar for the fourth time, you see, and it finally came clear). There is a character missing, a character that is fundamental to my admiration of Mi\u00e9ville's work. I can still appreciate him without this character; I can luxuriate in his gorgeous prose without this character; I can even lose myself in Bas-Lag without this character; but it is this character that makes Perdido Street Station and The Scar such fundamental books in my literary pantheon. And that character is place.Perdido Street Station introduces us to New Crobuzon. And New Crobuzon becomes a character, not just a setting. It is not just the people who are being ravaged by the Slake Moths, but the sweltering, desert dryness of the Glasshouse, the shadows of the Ribs, the gardens of Sobek Croix, and the refuse of Griss Twist. These boroughs, bestowed with sensual reality, suffer as much from the literal \"dreamshit\" as the people who lose their minds do. And Mi\u00e9ville spends time making us know New Crobuzon. He lingers in every borough, makes us smell and taste and feel everything. It's his intention, and it makes New Crobuzon, perhaps, the most important character in Perdido Street Station.The Scar, then, gives us Armada. Another character setting. Another unruly, sensually realistic, passionately crafted city, this time floating over the oceans of Bas-Lag, a giant Pirate vessel with its own internal politics, its own \"quarters,\" its own industry, its own secrets and identity, all tethered loosely together as each ship is tethered to each ship in a technicolor mosaic of shipbuilding eclecticism.But Iron Council gives us the world, and it is too much. Mi\u00e9ville offers too many places in his third book, and he never lets us know one place with anything close to the depth or intimacy we come to know New Crobuzon and Armada. There are wonders, yes, but they are too scattered, too sparsely drawn, too quickly passed over and through for them to percolate into our imaginations. And that is why Iron Council fails to live up to its predecessors (although I consider that higher praise than I would give most books).It is not a coincidence that all Mi\u00e9ville's Bas-Lag books have, thus far, been titled after places. But Mi\u00e9ville doesn't just love places, he loves cities and expresses cities -- stationary or floating -- better than any author I've read, so his next book, The City & The City, should be a cracking return to what Mi\u00e9ville does best.No, Iron Council isn't brilliant, but still it IS damn, damn good."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Dear China,It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.I wanted to like Iron Council more, and there were parts of it I really did like, but the old magic was just not there.I remember first meeting you on the pages of Kraken, and your fantastic images, scenes and people made me want to spend more time with you.Then we spent some time together stepping in between Bes\u017ael and Ul Qoma and I realized the depth and virtuosity was more than a flash in the pan, you were on to some heady stuff, THE NEW WEIRD. I was hooked.Then I came to visit you in Bas-Lag. I was impressed by Perdido Street Station and blown away by The Scar.When I came back to Bas-Lag by way of the Iron Council, I was again impressed. A western? Steampunk fits that genre, sure! Only China could imagine that and then pull it off. And the politics, why not? Leftist political issues are important to you and so why not throw some of that in, the subversive intrigue would add a Joseph Conrad element to the narrative.All of the world building ingredients of your impressive imagination was there: the cactusae and the Vodyanoi \u2013 even an appearance of the Weavers.And yet \u2026The narrative tended to drag, the action waxed and waned and bless your heart, you went on and on and on. Some editing, a hundred or so less, would have been more.You\u2019re still a weird genius, still a bright star in the speculative fiction genre, and we can still be friends.Love,Lyn"}, {"userName": "Nataliya", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya", "userReview": "Iron Council is China Mi\u00e9ville's most overtly political fiction work, but don't pigeonhole it. Between the revolutionary fervor, fantasy, trains, and Western-like parts runs a common theme of love and the painful, desperate, doomed human longing. I loved this book. It was not the insta-love like it was with \"The Scar\" but a long, careful, slow-to-build-up affair that by the end of the story fully blossomed. This book is fascinating, passionate, brutal at times, thought-provoking and deliberately anger-inducing. But at the same time, it's like Mi\u00e9ville deliberately made it not as easy to love as his other works. Let me explain.I've read 4 Mi\u00e9ville's books by now, and I think one of his greatest strengths as a storyteller is the ability to not just create amazingly imaginative and creative universes but also to lovingly make the setting of the story a true protagonist. \"Perdido Street Station\" was the ode to New Crobuzon; \"The Scar\" was a love song for Armada; \"The City & The City\" was a story about the divide between Besz\u00e9l and Ul Qoma. Here, however, we are taken on the quest, getting glimpses into many different corners of Bas Lag, only quick looks at the really changed New Crobuzon, and for a while only a teasing promise of the titular Iron Council. Yes, eventually I did love Iron Council, but it took so long to get there that it never became the same real character as Mi\u00e9ville's other locales did.But once I got past the grief of not falling in love with a geographical location, I was able to fully appreciate and passionately love the painful and difficult themes of this book. The ramifications of Crobuzonian politics, only glimpsed in the first two novels, finally take the center stage. Mi\u00e9ville is not subtle about where he stands on social rights and inequalities, and I loved the passionate and open expression of his views. It is not difficult to draw parallels between our less-than-perfect society obsessed with money, power, greed, and inequality, and the world of New Crobuzon, on the verge of collapse and catastrophe.New Crobuzon, the (in)famous festering filth of a city, believe it or not, has changed for the worse. The political oppression is at its worst, it's basically under the martial law, the xenophobia is at its height due to an undergoing war, the poverty and corruption are appalling, and no wonder that social dissatisfaction and unrest are brewing. Instead of exciting time on the barricades, however, we get to take a look into the heart of the brewing revolution - the tensions between revolutionary factions, the differences between the 'talkers' and the anarchists, the plottings, the mistrust, the fear. The oppressiveness is palpable, the atmosphere is rotten and suffocating, and the overall effect on the reader is powerful.At the same time, we get to see even more of the single greatest horror and injustice of the Crobuzonian system - the Remade. The horrific bodily remaking that the criminals (including the political ones) undergo marks them as outcasts, permanent slaves, nobodies, people below the regard of society. They were briefly shown in PSS; their plight was mentioned in \"The Scar\". But it is only in Iron Council that we get to see more of the ramifications of this. We get to see their suffering and their fighting back. I could not help but feel my heart break a bit over their pain and torture. And it made me reflect on all the ways our present-day society marginalizes those it does not approve of - the effect I'm sure CM was going for.We also see the gender issues that up until now were not addressed much in Crobuzonian universe. I found it striking how women are degraded and marginalized, how a strong Remade woman is an abomination because of her 'unwomanly' strength, how even during the strikes and rebellion the women are treated as vastly inferior, nothing but instruments for men's sexual satisfaction which they 'owe' them - to the point of creating 'rape squads', and how a woman's revenge is even described as simply a 'grudge'. Yet again Mi\u00e9ville does not give us an ending we would love to have - you know, the one where conflicts get resolved, the bad guys get their comeuppance, and the good guys are vindicated. But life does not work like that, life tends to reset itself towards the status quo with maybe small new hope brewing under the surface - and CM reflects this in his writing. It is 'weird' and fantastical, with adventures and monsters (even though we can agree that the true monsters are always people) - but it is nevertheless very painfully real in its emotions and psychological effects of the outcomes. Everything comes at a cost and the costs are often very hard to bear. It's not a comfort read, not a book that will make you feel better - but that is not always the purpose of literature, is it now? Sometimes the purpose is to unsettle you and make you think.But the part I loved the most, the one that left perhaps the biggest impact on me, was the art about love and human longing. It underlies every action, every event of this story. The revolutionary fervor is fueled by longing for change and better life. The Iron Council is triggered by the longing for freedom and justice. And, of course, there was the love and longing of Cutter and Judah - albeit, sadly, not for the same thing. Cutter was heartbreaking in his love, devotion, and longing for Judah - the feelings that he knew too well weren't shared or reciprocated, but quite often seemed to be simply used. He was so touching, so pained in this that I felt a lump in my throat at times reading about him. No one, I repeat - no one should be doled out sorta-kinda-love simply as a gesture of kindness; that is just cruel.\"When Cutter understood that the sex would only ever be an act of patrician friendship, profane and saintly generosity would only ever be a gift from Judah, he tried to bring it to a close, but could not sustain the abstinence.\" Judah, with his \"parasite innard goodness\", with his never-ending devotion to and obsession with the Iron Council - to the point where we, along with Ann-Hari, question whether his love gives him the right to do what he ended up doing. Ann-Hari and Ori, with their longing to change history, to find something bigger than them, to help make something better. Toro, longing for revenge long-overdue. All of them are desperate, unhappy, driven by forces that they may not comprehend and yet cannot resist. So heartbreaking. \"He feels pinioned by history. He can wriggle like a stuck butterfly but can go nowhere.\"And this leads me to another theme that I felt I was not even qualified to talk about as I think I may have missed the significance of it in quite a few parts of the book was the power of history, its relentless march, sweeping everything in its wake towards... something. The relentless pull of history that makes you feel small and insignificant. I may need a reread to fully grasp the implications.===========================================Overall, a rather challenging but ultimately rewarding and emotionally uneasy read that makes you ponder quite a few difficult questions. 4.5 stars. I recommend it highly, and advise sticking with it even if you do not fall in love with it right away. That love will come eventually, I promise."}, {"userName": "Mona", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7020601-mona", "userReview": "I gave this four stars, but I also gave Mieville's \"The Scar\" four stars.But they aren't equal. (This highlights the difficulty with the Goodreads rating system).\"The Scar\" probably deserved a 4.5 (nearly perfect), where this rates more like a 3.5.This is the third book in the New Crobuzon/Bas Lag series.The first two were \"Perdido Street Station\" and \"The Scar\".\"The Iron Council\" takes place in the same universe but many years later, in the nineteenth century (where the earlier two books were in the eighteenth century). I cannot remember the exact timeline, but Mieville does mention it somewhere in the novel.Mieville has said he wants to write a novel in every genre. \"Iron Council\" seems to be his version of a Western. There are transport and pack animals, guns, outlaws, and the building of a railroad. This is a fascinating tale in spite of its large faults. It got wildly mixed reviews from both professional critics and Goodreaders. Many people found it tedious. I can understand why they didn't like the book. But I was hooked, after a doubtful start.This story follows the history of a motley group of revolutionaries who attempt to overthrow the brutal, elitist government of New Crobuzon (a city which is a sort of fantastic version of London) both from within the city and from outside of its boundaries.One of their biggest grievances against the government is its method of punishing criminals by \"remaking\" them (grafting pieces of animals, humans, or machinery to their bodies, often in cruel ways). The \"remade\" are ostracized by New Crobuzon \"whole\" humans. There is also a lot of racial tension between the humans and the various other races of New Crobuzon (the Kepri, who have human bodies and insectoid heads; the Cactusi, who are shaped like walking cactuses), etc. There is also tension between the haves and the have nots in New Crobuzon.Those issues aren't new, and Mieville has already said a lot about them in the previous two books.Part of the book is the story of the attempt by the TRT Corporation (Transcontinental Railroad Trust) to build a railroad connecting New Crobuzon to other parts of Bas Lag. The labor is hard, the foremen are brutal, and a lot of the workers are remade or those of other races (especially Cactusi, as they are strong and good at tough physical work). Another part of the story involves the activities of various subversive political groups within the city. Eventually the two story threads converge.The major characters are all involved in one or both of these threads.The main character is Judah Low. No one seems to have noticed that his name deliberately resembles that of Judah Loew, a real character in history. Loew was a sixteenth century rabbi, Kabbalist, and tzaddik (Jewish saint) who created the Golem of Prague. The Judah Low of \"Iron Council\" is a self taught and very talented golemist (maker of golems). Golems are creatures created out of inanimate objects (traditionally earth or clay) that are animated to serve the wills of their creators, who can also return them to their original inanimate state. Judah, in his role as a scout for the new TRT railroad, contacts an indigenous tribe, the Stiltspear, and learns golem making from them. He then expands and perfects the art on his own.Judah disappears from New Crobuzon for a long time. Cutter, a shop keeper and Judah's on-and-off lover, organizes a small group to go into the wilderness of Bas-Lag to search for him. Cutter's love for Judah is unrequited. He is quite a bit younger than Judah. Cutter's search party includes a human couple, Elsie and Pomeroy, and Drogon, a \"whisperer\" who latches onto their group and saves their lives a few times. (The whisperer can be heard from a great distance and can whisper commands or suggestions). Another major character is Ori, a day laborer and underground resistor who gets involved at first with a left wing group that publishes a newspaper called \"Runagate Rampant\". This group talks a lot and doesn't do much, in Ori's opinion. Ori goes on to become a member of a more action oriented radical group lead by the mysterious and dangerous Toro. Ori is also fascinated by Spiral Jacobs, an elderly homeless man, who traverses New Crobuzon, painting spirals everywhere. There is Ann-Hari, also Judah's lover. Ann-Hari becomes a firebrand radical. At one point she organizes a (somewhat humorously presented, but dead serious) prostitute's strike. Although Mieville is clearly on the side of the radicals, he also shows them making grievous mistakes, including unnecessary killings and infighting. These errors undermine their cause. Mieville is also not afraid to show the serious character deficiencies of the rebels. Ann-Hari, for example, becomes such a fanatic she can no longer listen to reason. Ori, after various traumas, becomes too paralyzed to act when he should. Judah is vain and self-involved. And so on.One of the main problems with the book is the characters. Not one of them is terribly compelling or sympathetic. \"Iron Council\" lacks engaging main characters like Bellis Coldwine in \"The Scar\" or Isaac and Lin in \"Perdido Street Station\".Another problem is the sometimes wearisomely lengthy and inscrutable descriptions of esoterica. For example, Mieville lost me in a battle scene in which fire elementals clash with air and (possibly) water elementals (I was never entirely sure). As usual, Mieville is a master of language and verbal pyrotechnics, but sometimes he seems to glory in making his language nearly opaque.Still, in spite of these problems, this story is so fascinating one cannot stop reading (or in my case, listening). And Mieville is an original, as usual. There's nothing derivative here.But, be forewarned, there are no happy endings. And things are not neatly tied up at the book's close. If you require happy endings and unambiguous resolutions, this novel is probably not for you. Actor Gildart Jackson does an excellent job of reading the audio."}, {"userName": "Ivan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31294609-ivan", "userReview": "Full review to come at some point in future hopefully.For now like the rest of the series, combination of very weird but very well written steampunk and real world politics with ambiguous sides and no truly right answer."}, {"userName": "Jacob", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/637062-jacob", "userReview": "December 2008Gods and Jabber, I don't know why I love this one the most. It's not necessarily better than the other Bas-Lag Books (don't you dare call them a trilogy, don't you dare. Old China says he'll always come back to this; there's more to come), and it's nowhere near the worst. There's just something about this that feels so radically different, so alien, so apart from the others. Perdido Street Station was new and fresh and amazing, yeah, but it felt familiar enough--while still being strange and fantastic, of course--that you still felt just-so comfortable reading it (or as comfortable as you could be reading about sex with bug-people), and The Scar was a fun old adventure story, exotic and equally fantastic but still an ab-sequel to PSS.But here, here, Iron Council rips us away from mid-1700s (Anno Urbis) New Crobuzon and tosses us thirty, forty years into a city that barely remembers the Midsummer Nightmares, and what's this? No more constructs? Jack's dead? Ben Flex is just a name? The fucking Militia's out?You want the same old city, you wish it could stay frozen in time, but New Crobuzon is different. Changed. It's darker, uglier, more cynical. And even when Cutter and the others escape, chasing the near-prophet Judah Low on his quest for the Iron Council, the city still clings to them like an oil slick. The city in Isaac's day was hardly bright and cheerful, but back then it still echoed with adventure. Now the militia are out, and everything else had to go into hiding. It's time to go west to bring the Iron Council home.That long out-west adventure-quest itself, and the long-ago middle piece detailing the uncertain gestation and sudden, violent birth of Iron Council, make up the bulk of the story, mixed with snatches of back-home reports of the small revolutionary movements taking place in the city, and this jump back and forth from cynical near-despair to hopeful optimistic questing is what makes this a hard, weird novel. It jumbles in places, it tosses about; it's not always a pleasant read, or an easy one. It's tougher, more political, more insistant. But it's so good. So rewarding. And even the end, that fat and unnatural anticlimactic-climax, that so-wrong final meeting of the Council and the City, even as you want to yell \"that is not how it should have happened!\" you cannot help but think \"Yes, yes, that is how it was, how it is, how it should be.\" There is something strange and wonderful about Mieville's works that both frustrate and inspire.Mieville likes playing with cities. New Crobuzon is exotic enough already, and the ship-city of Armada from TS was plenty awesome. Here we have Iron Council itself, the perpetual train, ungrateful child of New Crobuzon. Makes you almost giddy wondering what Old China will give us next."}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "I love the first two Bas-Lag books but it took me ages to get around to this third volume due to the relatively high number of less than enthusiastic reviews on Goodreads and elsewhere. Yes, I can be swayed by reviews if the consensus opinion leans towards the negative. At the end of the day though I could not resist picking this book up as it is the last Bas-Lag volume for the foreseeable future (Mi\u00e9ville may come back to it but he seems to have no plan to do so at the moment). Another thing in Iron Council's favor is that Mi\u00e9ville himself is aware that it is not as well received as the previous Bas-Lag books but still consistently defends it to the hilt during interviews. He even said that it is his favorite volume of the three (I may add sources for this bold statement later, but in the meantime Google is your friend!). If I remember correctly he feels that it is the most well written and mature of the three. What I am not sure he realises or acknowledges though is that it is also the least fun.The book is essentially about the citizens of New Crobuzon\u2019s struggle for equal rights, justice, and a good life. Parts of it reminds me a lot of Les Mis\u00e9rables, unfortunately, it does not have Victor Hugo\u2019s well developed and colorful cast of characters. Characterization is not normally a problem for China Mi\u00e9ville but the character h development on this novel is not up to his usual standard, not appalling by any means just not quite up to snuff for him. One major advantage the Bas-Lag series has over most epic fantasy is its sheer weirdness, its bestiary includes Khepri ladies with insects for heads, the amphibian Vodyanoi with their water sculptures, Garudas, Cactacaes (cactus people) etc. There is no place in Bas-Lag for trolls, elves, ogres and dwarves, they can eff off as far as Mr. Mi\u00e9ville is concerned. Even wizards can eff off unless they are called thaumaturges instead. Then you have the remades, humans grotesquely modified \u201cthaumaturgy\u201d as punishment for crimes (major and minor). One example is a character who has his head permanently turned back to front, and another with a baby\u2019s arms attached to her head.This is the most political novel of his that I have read so far with the titular Iron Council being a steam train kidnapped by rebels, former railway employees cheated of their wages. They soon become legendary inspirations for the rebels of New Crobuzon who conspire to bring down the oppressive government. In the meantime, the city of New Crobuzon is also at war with another city called Tesh who are masters of some particularly weird and horrific magic - natch, thaumaturgy. Quite why the war between the two cities is relevant to the novel\u2019s main story arc I am not sure though the thaumaturgic warfare is wonderfully bizarre. Another bizarre idea is the railroad for the Iron Council which is built just ahead of the train and disassembled behind it, how is this logistically possible I am not sure though you can get a lot done with thaumaturgy. When reading a China Mi\u00e9ville book you never have to worry about having to tolerate sub-par prose, his writing is as literary as ever. The only snag is you may want to have a dictionary within reach and also be prepared to decipher some of his neologisms. Words like tenebrotropic, atrabilious and subvocalurgy are sometimes arcane words you can find in a dictionary, while other times the author\u2019s inventions. There is a large chunk of the book narrated in some kind of mythical or legend style where dialog is rare is quotation marks are not used. I kind of understand why Mi\u00e9ville may have wanted to write this portion of he novel this way but it reads like a rather detached second or even third hand account of events. I also add another layer between the reader and the story which makes it harder to immerse into the story.The weirdest thing about this book is that it seems more enjoyable in retrospect than during the actual reading of it. There are some wonderful ideas, creatures and world building. At the end if the day it is something of a disappointment for this particular fan. Not at all unforgivable, though, I am always keen to read more Mi\u00e9villes."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "We live in a culture that desires fragmented stories; stories that are told quickly and compellingly, so we can move on to the next tale. It is why we love visual forms so much. It is why YA fiction is increasingly popular with older crowds. It is why graphic novels are on the rise as a literary form. But where are the novellas? Where are books like One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, The Old Man and the Sea, Heart of Darkness, The Awakening, A Clockwork Orange?I have been looking, waiting, hoping, for a resurgence of the novella as a popular form, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be coming. Roth\u2019s The Humbling was a novella and so was Meyer\u2019s The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner, but novellas from a literary giant like Roth and a throwaway sequel by a hack like Meyer hardly suggest a healthy return of the form. So I\u2019ve been growing despondent, wanting desperately to see the form I love become a form of choice once again.But then I noticed something. The novella isn\u2019t gone. It\u2019s just hiding. I\u2019ve discovered the novella is still out there; only now it is hidden in the middle of bigger works. Publishers are unwilling willing to publish novellas because publishers think novels are the safer, more familiar bet for the consumer. Novellas, after all, are for University students and academics; they are not for everyday teenagers, housewives and grumpy old men. But when novellas are hidden, they\u2019re no threat at all. Sometimes they can be a part of a novel, and sometimes they lie in combination with other novellas to create a loosely linked group of stories posing as a novel (see the works of David Mitchell) \u2013 but they\u2019re out there still; they just don\u2019t look like novellas. Case in point is one of the finest novellas ever written ... by anyone ... anywhen -- anamnesis: The Perpetual Train. This unparalleled tale is hidden in the center of China Mieville\u2019s most ambitious Bas-Lag novel \u2013 Iron Council \u2013 and it is a breathtaking display of everything that makes the novella a beautiful form.Its prose is sparing; its story is tight, compact, compelling and rich. It focuses on one man, Judah Low, and his journey from corporate funded adventurer to anti-imperialist somaturge to founding iron counsellor is perfect and complete all by itself. Nothing more is needed than anamnesis: The Perpetual Train\u2019s cancerous spread across the land turned iconic standard for worker solidarity. The rest of Iron Council is superfluous. Which leaves me even more in awe of Mieville than I have ever been, but a little frustrated with him too. The events in Iron Council, which sprawl around anamnesis: The Perpetual Train like suburbs, are beautiful in their own right. They bravely incorporate sexual politics, economics, uprising, war, poverty and corruption, fleshing out Bas-Lag with a perspective that raises a middle finger to the more conservative traditions of speculative fiction. But, as impressive as it all is, I don\u2019t think it was necessary, and I wish that Mieville had simply left good enough \u2013 actually, great enough \u2013 alone. anamnesis: The Perpetual Train would have been one of the greatest books ever written. I really believe that. But we\u2019ll have to settle for Iron Council being merely excellent.That\u2019s not so bad."}, {"userName": "Ben Babcock", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-ben-babcock", "userReview": "Recall in my review of The Scar how I was whining about my opinion of China Mi\u00e9ville and his novels remaining relatively constant? How I wanted to read something different, something I could say didn't rank equally with the other three novels by him that I have read?This is the story of why I should have been more careful with my wishing.I knew something was wrong\u2014perhaps I should say off\u2014almost from the beginning of this book. The opening was grandiose in Mi\u00e9ville's usual style (which, if you've read Mi\u00e9ville, is explanation enough; if you haven't\u2014why haven't you?) but our first meeting with the main characters is more confusing than enlightening. Worse still, none of the characters are all that interesting. I didn't care about Cutter, Elsie, or Pomeroy. I didn't care about Ori or Spiral Jacobs or Toro. I certainly didn't care for Judah, who seems like a monumental jerk wrapped inside a coat of comfortable self-sacrifice.Characterization in The Iron Council is not sloppy, because nothing Mi\u00e9ville does is sloppy. From purple prose to passive voice, Mi\u00e9ville writes with impunity\u2014and a vocabulary to show it\u2014because the end result is something captivating and beautiful; the novel itself is work of art. So it's not sloppy; it is, unfortunately, rather lacklustre. Both of the preceding Bas-Lag novels, \nPerdido Street Station\n and The Scar, had a strong central protagonist: Isaac and Bella, respectively. We lack such a protagonist in The Iron Council. The present-day narrative alternates between two convergent plots, with Cutter and Ori providing a perspective for each respective storyline. The middle of the book tells the genesis of the Iron Council and follows Judah; ironically, while Judah is my least favourite character, this is probably the best part of the entire novel.Cutter follows Judah out into the unexplored wilderness beyond New Crobuzon. Judah is searching for the Iron Council, a runaway train of railworkers, Remade slaves, and prostitutes. He knows that New Crobuzon is finally sending an expeditionary force to wipe out the train, and he wants to find the Iron Council first. Cutter follows Judah not because he has faith in the Iron Council but because he has faith in Judah (this point is important to the rest of the plot); Cutter is in fact in hopeless, unrequited love with Judah.Neither Cutter nor Judah seem very real or three-dimensional; they are just names, with the barest amount of personality. So I didn't feel a lot of sympathy for Cutter as he allows Judah to manipulate him:There were none of the chances Cutter had wanted, no opportunity to tell the stories of the Collective, to ask for the stories of the Council. It was rushed and ugly. He felt desperately angry as the Councillors prepared to die. He felt as well a sense of his own failure, that he was letting down Judah. You knew I couldn't do it, you bastard. That's why you're still there. Getting ready some plan or other for when I fail. Still, even though Judah had expected it, Cutter hated that he had not succeeded.The dynamic that Mi\u00e9ville creates between these two is brilliant, and it's a rather timeless tragedy. In this case, however, its characters are not drawn with enough depth, and so the tragic effect is instead rendered a clich\u00e9.Back in New Crobuzon, Ori is the New Crobuzon equivalent of a Marxist disenchanted with all the talk and ready for some good ol' proletariat revolution. The New Crobuzon of The Iron Council is an even grimmer place than the city of Perdido Street Station. The fallout from Isaac's alliance with the Construct Council caused a messy curtailment on the use of constructs throughout the city. Coupled with economic recession and a war with Tesh, and New Crobuzon is under martial law in all but name. These are not fun times. But Ori is tired of reading newspaper articles and meeting with a group of people who all call themselves \"Jack\" the way a communist uses \"comrade.\" He wants some action.Ori, like me, should be careful what he wishes for.He falls in with a group led by Toro, a character who wears a massive helmet forged in the shape of a bull. With the helmet, Toro can sense magical energies and even teleport through space (by charging like a bull and tearing a hole in reality with the helmet's horns). The group plans to assassinate Mayor Stem-Fulcher (remember her from Perdido Street Station?), reasoning that a successful mission would be like beheading the \"snake\" of Parliament. I'll leave it up to you to guess how well that works out.I quite enjoyed Ori's storyline, if not Ori himself, and the tale of revolution on the streets of New Crobuzon. It was almost like the good old times back in Perdido Street Station, when the city almost felt alive through Mi\u00e9ville's careful descriptions. Almost, but not quite. New Crobuzon is present in The Iron Council, but it is no longer the front-and-centre locus around which the novel revolves.Instead, Mi\u00e9ville once again chooses a mobile location as his central focus. This time it's a train instead of a floating city. There's some metaphor to be found within the idea of a train, which is bound to go only where there is a railroad, representing one's freedom. (Indeed, one of the conceits of The Iron Council is that these fugitive railway workers are constantly tearing up the track behind them and laying down new rails before the train. It's odd, but it's very Mi\u00e9ville.) As with so much else of his work, he creates an almost-but-not-quite-romantic vision of life on an ever-changing railscape. Like New Crobuzon and Armada, the citizens of the Iron Council are cosmopolitan; however, the scale of the city is a lot smaller and more constrained. We get a sense of the fragility of the Council\u2014everything is reused, if possible, because their resources are limited\u2014as well as the sense of boundless adventure\u2014they have maps no one in New Crobuzon has. In that respect, the Iron Council is as well-developed, as a \"weird city,\" as any of Mi\u00e9ville's creations.I'm very ambivalent about the fate of the Iron Council and the ending of the book. Part of me hates it, if only because it seems so inevitable the way Mi\u00e9ville has written it. Part of me enjoys its creativity. It is consistent with my favourite thing about this book, which is its portrayal of the difficulty of staging a class revolution. Ori quickly realizes that it's one thing to begin an uprising and quite another thing to succeed at it; the militia is ruthless, and even the death of New Crobuzon's mayor is not necessarily going to stop them. This real but unattractive truth fuels a lot of the tension in the last part of the book, as well as Judah's final act that affects the Iron Council and everyone aboard it.If anything, The Iron Council, with its brief allusions to the events of Perdido Street Station, hasjust made me want to reread that first Bas-Lag novel all over again. I want to return to the delightful machinations of Mayor Rudgutter and then-secretary Stem-Fulcher; I want to see them negotiate with the Ambassador from Hell and the Weaver. In addition to these allusions, there are plenty of new, small glimpses at the weird and wonderful world that is Bas-Lag. Once again, Mi\u00e9ville shows that his imagination and his ability to create a world are without parallel. And beyond the worldbuilding lurks a good tale too: The Iron Council is a strong story of standing up to authority and striking, albeit not always succeeding. However, none of its characters could interest me, and I found that to be a massive stumbling block in reading this book. I read it, but I wasn't really into the story. There was no point where I would have been disappointed if something had interrupted me during my reading; I was a casual visitor to Bas-Lag this time. I suppose there is nothing wrong with that, per se, but with a writer as good as Mi\u00e9ville, I'm always going to be disappointed when the experience is just casual."}, {"userName": "Oscar", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1754850-oscar", "userReview": "\u2018El Consejo de Hierro\u2019 es una novela ambientada en el fant\u00e1stico mundo de Bas-lag, donde tambi\u00e9n transcurr\u00edan esas obras maestras que son \u2018La estaci\u00f3n de la Calle Perdido\u2019 y \u2018La cicatriz\u2019.

According to interviews, Mieville sounds like he has every intention of returning to the world of Bas Lag in the future, so I won't refer to this as \"the last Bas Lag novel.\" But, as of 2009, it's the most recent.I found the experience of reading Iron Council markedly different from the first two books set in this world. For one, in this book the story isn't as localised. We have met the city of New Crobuzon in Perdido Street Station and the pirate collective of Armada in The Scar. Now, we're in New Crobuzon again, along with tons of other places. Iron Council chronicles the war between Tesh and New Crobuzon, a war that is occuring at the same time that citizens of New Crobuzon are attempting to overthrow the political party in power. The Iron Council itself is a essentially a runaway train--a train that was intended to link New Crobuzon to other large cities. But, when the government refused to pay the workers on this train as they traveled along, building the tracks, the workers stole the train. They began picking up the tracks behind them, and the train passed off the border of any maps. They went so far that New Crobuzon was afraid to follow. Well, rumor has it that the Iron Council is returning. In an already heated political climate, the return of the Iron Council is gunpowder. The novel has a very compelling plot, and some of the most poetic and fantastic scenes in the whole Bas Lag sequence. As his characters travel through uncharted regions, bizarre creatures we haven't seen before show up regularly. Also, this story has the most optimistic ending I've yet read from Mieville. It's not exactly a \"happy\" ending...but, aren't those just boring anyway?This book had a lot of things going for it. However, it wasn't as satisfying or engaging of a read as P.S.S. or The Scar for two main reasons. First, the main characters weren't as engaging. With one exception, the main characters weren't as complex as those from the other books. Character complexity is always a very big thing for me. Usually, it's the most important thing. Here, the main characters tend to have one motivation, one inspiration, and their actions follow logically from it. The characters don't act in ways that surprise me. The other reason this book wasn't as engaging is the writing just wasn't as clear. In a book where the fantastical and unusual is happening on a regular basis, it really helps if the writing puts a clear picture in the reader's head, and if new concepts aren't just tossed in without explanation. Through much of the book, I wasn't quite sure who was talking or exactly what was happening. I found myself frustrated on numerous occasions by the obscuring word-choices that Mieville made. Despite everything that I liked about this book, I gained no momentum while reading it. At no point was I particularly compelled to keep reading, and at no point did I really care how things would turn out for anyone involved. Although I thought the end was strong and moving, it didn't make up for all of the non-engaging passages that had come before. So, by no means was Iron Council a bad novel. But, it could've been as great as the other Bas Lag books, and it wasn't."}, {"userName": "Stuart", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart", "userReview": "I wanted very much to like Iron Council, considering how much I was drawn into the worlds of Perdido Street Station and The Scar, but despite my best efforts, I couldn't do it.

Judging from many of the positive (though qualified) reviews of other GR readers, the story is difficult but rewarding, but I think if I don't care what happens by the mid-way point, then it's not going to happen.I didn't connect with the characters or locales of the story, or the language itself, which is much more terse, downbeat, and distant than the first two books. It's a dark, muddled story, and I couldn't get through The Perpetual Train part, detailing the story of Judah Low and emergence of the Iron Council. There is a tendency for books these days to take many pages to establish a setting and storyline, but for me, if the first half doesn't grab you, there's no point in continuing on, especially with almost 400 other books on the to-read list.

Both books involve a renegade, mobile city that interacts weirdly with a bizarre breach in the fabric of the setting (here, the Stain, there, the eponymous Scar). Both involve ambitious plans by the outcasts with broad geopolitical implications. Both testify to the abject failure of grand plans.The master figure of the writing is intervention. The terms appears expressly on very many occasions, referring most prominently to the golemetry of the foremost protagonist, who takes his name directly from the czech legend (a connection that is not frivolous, considering that the lengthy anamnesis section, itself a rhetorical intervention into the regular flow of narration, is a marxist retelling of the biblical Exodus); to the anarchist leader's nifty trick, an \"ontic abomination\" (397) that intervenes through space (327); to political puppet shows (306); and to numerous other items, including the cacotropic intervention of the Stain into normal space.The golemetry stuff is almost always an \"intervention,\" and is very compellingly contrasted with the art of the elementarii (500 ff). Golemetry is \"an argument, an intervention, so will I intervene and make a golem in darkness or in death, in elyctricity, in sound, in friction, in idea or hopes?\" Rhetoric is golemetry, then, as is political praxis. The golemetrist here undergoes a transition, from a railway scout, engaged in genocide; to an amateur-xenologist-gone-native, whereupon he acquires golemetry skills; to radicalized railway worker; to senior revolutionary; and to several other roles, none insigificant. His trajectory is complicated, but memorable.Only slightly less important figuratively is puppetry, of all things. We're keyed into this figure early in the narrative, when a leftwing activist involves himself in a provocative (and perhaps Brechtian) puppet show, as part of his transformation from a traditional socialist (concerned with labor unions, strikes, parliamentary procedure, learned discussions about the \"toil concept of worth\" and \"graphs of the swag-slump tendency\" (96)) to a propaganda-of-the-deed anarchist who lacks both Hoffman's wit and Alinsky's cleverness. Groups are revealed to be unwitting puppets of other groups on several occasions. While this is business as usual on the bourgeois side, the revolutionaries regard this type of malappropriation to be worthy of execution in both instances where it occurs among their own leadership, working nicely with the discussion of Garuda law at the end of PSS.Another, the museum: the text presents several--a dead culture (167), a venereal grotesquerie (410), and impoverishment amid bourgeois excess (366). The denouement itself creates a unique museum, as part of a singular intervention. This last represents the ultimate in propaganda-of-the-deed tactics.The denouement makes plain its judgment over which leftwing strategy is superior, regarding the tactical disagreements between some anarchists and some socialists (not to suggest that those terms are necessarily or always mutually exclusive, of course). It nevertheless defers judgment on the issue of which internal socialist tendency is superior. The text's \"to the Finland Station\" moment is perpetually deferred at the novel's conclusion--and thus the very Soviet post-February-pre-October dyarchy of the city resolves itself without the arrival of the setting's Lenin. (The ending's deferral-of-a-difference, a chiasmus of difference-that-defers, is a slick Derridian joke, for those who like that stuff, incidentally.)The text sounds a pair of warnings: a revolution can become the tool of its own ruling class, and it can become the fifth column of another state's ruling class. Each of these possibilities is noted, insofar as railway industrialists might be able recapture their long-awaited profits, and as propaganda deeds can distract as much as they can awaken, even contrary to the intentions of the revolution.There's more to be said about many other items; every page is pregnant--but this should suffice.Recommended for sinistrals, fans of subversive puppet shows, and committed golemetrists."}, {"userName": "Camille Stein", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19308897-camille-stein", "userReview": "Handlinger / Manecro - http://ow.ly/uIbKc & http://ow.ly/uIbF0 No escogemos lo que recordamos, piensa Judah, las historias que llevamos con nosotros.Eran jardineros de quitina.

I highly recommend the Iron Council to folks who like feminist/leftist science fiction that want to read a fantasy novel that doesn't celebrate the aristocracy. Iron Council is a novel about class struggle and the people in it, and it happens to be fantasy.I'm disappointed that Iron Council doesn't have many prominent female characters, although Mieville does show consistently shows women in positions of leadership and usually writes \"she or he\" and \"women and men\" to place women in the forefront. The main woman in the book is Ann-Hari, a leader in the iron council who initiated a sex-workers strike. Queer content is great! Of our three male protagonists, Judah is bisexual, his lover Cutter is gay, and we never learn Ori's preference one way or another.Mieville's monsters and magic is fresh and disturbing, too.

Iron Council is definitely my least favorite of the three, despite (or perhaps because of) being the most overtly political. Perhaps because of the focus on revolution, I felt the characters of this novel were much less interesting then the previous two. Unlike Isaac or Bellis, I never really connected with or identified with Cutter, Ori, Ann Hari or any other person or felt drawn into their conflicts (which I was completely with Perdido Street Station and the Scar). In particular, I felt the character of Judah to be fairly bland and I admit to being a bit bored with him and the whole Iron Council saga that took up a majority of the middle of the novel.However, Mieville does continue with his unique brand of world building, making the blend of a corrupt industrial-magical society seem not only completely alien but also very real, from the bizarre Cacotopic Stain to the various neighborhoods of New Crobozon. I also liked that, as in his previous novels, there is a bit of genre blending taking place in Bas Lag, which I find interesting. Perdido Street Station, for instance mixed a lot of horror and some noir into its fantasy while the Scar was very much a swashbuckling adventure story. In Iron Council, there is some definite Western stylings showing up, though the extra genre is a little less evident then in previous Bas Lag stories. In conclusion, I felt that Iron Council was a bit slow moving with comparatively undeveloped characters, though I enjoyed this last exploration of the world of Bas Lag and particularly, the city of New Crobozon and continues with Mieville's brand of genre blending."}, {"userName": "pearl", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1421798-pearl", "userReview": "This book was fantastic. I picked it up with some hesitation because of reviews I'd read, which said that Iron Council was \"the weakest\" of the series, that the plot and setting were a far cry from the complex, violently magical and Victorian-inspired backdrops of the previous two books. Other reviews simply said the book was too slow.And to some extent it is all true. Iron Council takes the reader much farther from the brilliant magics, sciences, and mythologies depicted in Perdido Street Station and The Scar. It explores less of the amazing creatures and races that were first introduced in those two books. And it also takes a much longer time to develop and for the motives of the main characters to become apparent. However, while I agree that Iron Council is the weaker of the Bas-Lag books for these reasons, it is still an incredibly powerful story for those very same reasons, and because of it, Iron Council stands alone as one of Mieville's most meaningful works.The focal point of the story is the titular Iron Council, the constantly moving train manned and lived in by former railroad workers turned renegade. Many of these railroad workers had once been criminals, jailed, then brutally (surgically) remade by the government into horrific mutilations of flesh, gear, steam, and engine, as eternal reminders of their crimes and lives as outcasts to be spat upon by society. It is this government of New Crobuzon that the workers, prostitutes, and renegades rise against, and from whom they steal the Iron Council. In doing so, the Iron Council becomes a beacon of necessary and long-sought freedom for all the people of back in the city-state of New Crobuzon, who themselves are caught in the chaos of political turubulence, as well as in war with the distant and fearsome land of Tesh.New Crobuzon itself is a city to explain all cities. In Perdido Street Station we are immersed in it, its sheer size and incredible diversity, and also its gruesome, horrifying underside. The Scar is set far away from New Crobuzon, but also further explores those people Remade by the government. But it is only in Iron Council that all these things are brought to a culmination. Its tremendous cast is what keeps this story amazing. They are shopkeepers, loom-workers, minorities, and Remade criminals. They are the commonality, they are you and I, oppressed by a government that is so ferociously bureaucratic, so sprawling, sick, and massively apathetic, that the appalling Remaking of its citizens has become accepted. Rebel organizations fill the streets of New Crobuzon, to debate, plan, and put into motion some way to subvert this despotism, to end the bloody, meaningless war with Tesh which is bringing home their soldiers maddened and horribly disfigured. They are stymied again and again, but with growing hope they speak about the the Iron Council, which is making its return, they say, to bring change to New Crobuzon. To renew and remake the city.Iron Council is a much more realistic book than its predecessors. I say \"realistic\" not because I mean that it features less of the fantastical. What I mean is that it places at the forefront issues which speak directly to our own society's struggles. The nature of freedom and visionary ideals are so beautifully explored in this story. While Perdido Street Station bespoke redemption and The Scar, possibilities, Iron Council is a testament of hope as well as challenge. The Iron Council must live on."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151899-tom", "userReview": "[after second reading]Yeah, I'm sticking with the two stars. Is it about preserving history? Is it about the inaccuracy of monuments? Is it about the sources of inspiration being stronger for what they inspire than for their truth? I'm not sure, and I don't care.As other reviewers have said, the reason Iron Council is less satisfying that Perdido Street Station or The Scar is because it's mostly endless description of conflicts and fights and there's very little character development. Ultimately, I don't care about Cutter or Judah or Ann-Hari or Ori or Elsie or Pomeroy or Thick Shanks or Drogon or, well, anyone. It feels like Mieville spends a lot of words to say very little.**I'm currently re-reading this to see if I was too hasty with my two stars.[after first reading]Compared to the other books set in Bas Lag, \"Perdido Street Station\" and \"The Scar\" this is definitely the weakest of the three. In fact, I would almost recommend avoiding this one.The book's problem stems from the fact that it keeps jumping between several different characters' perspectives and you have to rev up your interest each time it jumps. Part of the reason it's hard to sustain interest is the characters aren't that engaging this time around. I kept finding myself wondering what the point of this book was going to be. I got excited near the end of the book when it seemed like we were finally going to see where Mieville was taking us, but it just wasn't very interesting.It does have a couple of interesting scenes where we learn a little more about a couple of peripheral characters from \"Perdido Street Station\" but that wasn't enough for me to really like this book. You can read any of these three in any order, but do yourself a favor and read \"Perdido Street Station\" then \"The Scar\" and only pick up \"The Iron Council\" if you have nothing better to read."}, {"userName": "P.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/236606-p", "userReview": "I absolutely raced through Mieville's previous efforts, but this one was a slog. There were too many battles for my taste, and the characters had no depth whatsoever. Instead of trying to create depth, Mieville just repeats the same information over and over. Cutter loves Judah. Oh he loves him so much. Judah is unable to love, or is just priest-like. Why should I care? I never managed to care through the whole almost-600 pages. He also commits the literary crime of describing other fantasy races in the same way every time they appear in the story. I am really really aware by now that khepri women communicate through their head-scarabs with \"chymical\" blasts, because I've read it about 100 times over. And all the cool ideas that Mieville has aren't given time to impress; they're just sort of listed and thrown around, like look at me! I'm a cool word/idea!So maybe I liked it less than I thought."}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "I had eagerly anticipated reading Mieville's latest - but while I certainly enjoyed returning to the world of New Crobuzon, I have to admit that I did not like this book nearly as much as either 'The Scar' or 'Perdido Street Station.' Of course, I love both of those books, so my expectations for this one were very high. Still, I felt that the concepts in this book overwhelmed the story - the characters and events were secondary to Mieville's thoughts about repressive societies, social economics, the motivations of revolutionaries and seditionists, crime and punishment, the destructive cost of 'progress' etc. Not that these are not interesting topics - and admittedly, his other novels may also be more about milieu than about character.... but I just didn't get into this one as much.The setting of this story is conceptually interesting - a train, which is taken over in a workers' revolt, and which becomes an itinerant legend, laying tracks before itself and taking them up afterward... Meanwhile, seditionists in New Crobuzon ready for revolt...This would be a good candidate for a book club discussion - there are a lot of political parallels, a lot of comments on human nature... a lot of ideas.I'd definitely recommend it - but only to those who have already read The Scar' or 'Perdido Street Station.'"}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "Iron Council is one of those books that you don't so much read as tussle with. It's an adventure, a quest, and I often feel like there are underlying themes deeper than the obvious ones, ones that make me wish Perdido Street Station, in particular, was more recent in my memory. I feel that the three New Crobuzon books I've read hang together as a commentary about revolution and rebellion.

The conceit behind the eponymous Council is far-fetched--even in Mieville's crazy world--but Mieville pulls it off with his usual talent for language, description, and the evocation of something otherworldly and yet still grounded. I enjoyed this foray into Bas-Lag, and if Mieville ever turns his writing back to that vibrant, lusty world, I will sign up for the trip."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1378222-gary", "userReview": "This would be a 3.5 stars review if it were possible. I've become a China Mieville fan late compared to some (Amanda) via Kraken and King Rat and others but I confess I found Perdido Street Station to be very hard reading ( a bit like Jeff Van der Meer's early work) and Iron Council although easier than Perdido.. was still slow for me. It's something to do with his writing style I am sure because the ideas in the book are phenomenal. Truly original and very imaginative. The themes are big too - overthrow of corrupt/tyrannical government and inter-species relations (you can read this as racial tension without missing a beat). Mieville's style is poetic at times but his prose style in this and Perdido.. is not exactly experimental but it does push the boundaries of more run of the mill writing and he should be commended for his difference. The moral questions raised at the end of the book are extremely pertinent for us all and should make us question why we decide on certain courses of action, perhaps putting our own wants ahead of other's rights to decide for themselves. The ultimate fate of the iron Council is poignant in deed. Well worth reading."}, {"userName": "Arun Divakar", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar", "userReview": "There are quite a lot of wordings swirling inside my head now. Words like 'Power' , 'Revolution', 'Government' and so on. I am stuck with putting them down into coherent sentences. This was the outcome of the book for me : a muddled mind. The landscape of New Crobuzon is not unfamiliar to me thanks to Perdido Street Station.I still count that as one of the best books ever. But where the first book was one that cut across genres, here the tone is overtly political. There is a tone of an impending overhaul of the political system all through the plot. Mieville is exceptionally skilled at describing landscapes and the inhabitants. It is the most powerful part of the book too, these dreamy descriptions of fantastic landscapes.This was where it ended, after a while it started to get fuzzy. Two overlapping story lines building up to the climax is the structure and what i followed for a long time. Somewhere along the line of the tale, I lost track and like many a book that does not arouse interest in you this one became just another that I was trying to finish. I might not be the right person to rate this book but still for its wondrous descriptions I give it two stars."}], "description": "Following Perdido Street Station and The Scar, acclaimed author China Mi\u00e9ville returns with his hugely anticipated Del Rey hardcover debut.

New Crobuzon is being ripped apart from without and within. War with the shadowy city-state of Tesh and rioting on the streets at home are pushing the teeming city to the brink.
