But sometimes you can, and you do, even when you don't deserve it.\u201dI was no fan of this. Under normal circumstances I would have given it two stars instead of one. Only really bad or offensive books get one star. But in this case my personal dislike for the book won me over.Let's start with the main character. Sometimes I wonder why authors decide to create a main character that is so dislikeable. And not for literary reasons. Not like Jane Austen's Emma who is supposed to be a difficult and arrogant person. Apparently J. H. Trumble found him sympathetic and friendly and thought to herself that she was going to write the book about Nate, when his boyfriend Adam's side would have been so much better.Let me tell you about Nate. On a jealousy scale from 0 to 10 Nate is a 10. He has zero trust in his partner and gets upset about the tiniest things. He is so jealous that he even gets annoyed when his boyfriend, as opposed to him, does not get jealous when Nate mentions hanging out with another guy. Nate gets super angry at his boyfriend for hiding their relationship and being flirted with by a girl, even though he was the one to suggest hiding it. Out of anger at his boyfriend he starts a so-called relationship with a completely unexperienced guy two years younger, and uses him, fully aware of the fact the this boy adores him to pieces. I could go on and on. Nate is most of the things I hate in a main character.I think young adult literature has come far in the last few years. When you're used to Adam Silvera, Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz and Shaun David Hutchinson, books like this fall short. Especially since they know what they are talking about because they are actual gay males, while Trumble is neither. The world isn't divided into people who accept gays and complete rednecks. Only in this book it is. Not everyone will pour their drinks over you, beat you up, harrass you and whisper behind their backs because OHMYGOSH TWO GUYS HOLDING HANDS. Not even in 2011 when this book was released.Again, I could go on forever, but I want to put this book aside and get over it. I'll just think about the coming release of There Will Be Other Summers instead.Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/763271-nancy", "userReview": "Cross-posted at Outlaw Reviews and at Shelf Inflicted If you decide to read this book, there are two things you need to overlook. -\tThe frequent time jumps throughout the story can be disorienting. Considering that very bad things happen to the main characters, I appreciate the author\u2019s use of this technique that in some ways helps to lessen the intensity of the events and in other ways makes them even more horrifying. Just pay attention and you will find the story flows nicely and comes together in the end. -\tThe end! The craptacular ending that takes place 10 years after the story\u2019s events. Though it was nice to see most of the story\u2019s main conflicts resolved, I wanted more evidence of the characters\u2019 work to get to that point. I also felt that certain significant issues were not addressed, which left me feeling vaguely unsatisfied. Nate and Adam meet in high school and are joined at the hip. Their love is true, but Adam heads off to New York to take an acting job after graduation, putting great strain on their relationship. Nate and Adam\u2019s relationship has all the passion and intensity of young people in love and was portrayed so effectively and authentically, that I found myself remembering my own difficult teenage years. It was easy to empathize with Nate and Adam, even if they lacked communication skills that would have prevented many of their problems. This is not just a love story, though. There is pain, heartbreak, and betrayal in spades. And there is the brutal sexual assault that left Nate emotionally wounded long after his injuries healed. Sensitive readers need not worry. Trumble skillfully interweaves details of the attack and its aftermath delicately through flashbacks. I loved this book and gobbled it up in two days, discreetly swiping my tears while I was riding the bus to work. Nate and Adam were so real that I wanted to reach through the pages and hug them. Though Nate\u2019s neediness and insecurity irritated me at times, I had to keep reminding myself that he is a teenager who suffered a traumatic experience. I\u2019m glad Nate and Adam had the support of their friends \u2013 Danial, a straight ally of Pakistani descent; Juliet, Adam\u2019s best friend who has a crush on Nate; and Luke, a sensitive, closeted boy who is drawn to Nate and is equally as needy. While I liked the supporting cast, I couldn\u2019t help being slightly annoyed by Juliet. One of these days I would like to read about a strong female character who can have a close gay male friend while still having a fulfilling life of her own. I realize this is a book for young adults, but I was slightly bothered that the sexual intimacy between Nate and Adam was perfunctorily handled and lacking in sensuality. It would have been nice to have a tender love scene contrast with all the homophobia and brutality. Minor complaints aside, this was an amazing book. Very highly recommended! I can\u2019t wait to read Luke\u2019s story."}, {"userName": "Heather K (dentist in my spare time)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time", "userReview": "One of the most angst-filled books that I have ever read... holy crap. This book is completely polarizing among my friends. Some hate it and 1 starred it, others loved it and favorited it. I feel like I'm on both ends simultaneously, so I settled on 3 stars. What I liked:- This book felt like an older YA book and I'm not talking about sex content. The way the characters acted and felt was authentic and mature while still staying appropriate for their age. It is a huge pet peeve of mine in YA when the characters are portrayed as simple or underdeveloped, like that's okay because it is YA. It isn't. Here, the 18 year olds had passion, fears, and angst poring out of every orifice- like real 18 year olds. It felt very, very true-to-life for me. - The relationship felt like a real relationship. This was a difficult point for me to acknowledge. I remember what it was like with my high school boyfriend- the ups, the downs, the misunderstandings, the drunken fights... it all was present here. As much as I loathed reading about the relationship between Adam and Nate at times, it rang painfully true. I felt their love, their passion, and really felt like I knew them as a couple, very intimately. - The character of Danial. Awesome in every way. - The grandma. Awesome in every way. - The editing and the writing. This book feels polished and professional. Someone took painstaking amounts of time to make it so. And it shows.- The way this book made me feel. F, it takes a lot for me to feel this passionate about a book, for good or for bad, so I have to acknowledge that this book elicited big emotions in me. - The character of Adam. You tried your best, poor thing. What I didn't like- I'm going to have to limit this because it could get a bit... rambly. I'll start with the time-jumps. It was confusing as hell for me at times. Time jumped from different points in the past to the present, and I often had trouble following. Just didn't really work for me.- Nate. Nate, you narcissistic, broken, needy little f-er. I have this strange love/hate relationship with him. I hate him for what he did to Adam. God, Nate was so needy and difficult and selfish at times. I really can't forgive him for some of the things that he did. I wanted to punch him towards the end of the book. Hard. But I also got where he was coming from a lot of the time. He was truly in need of some serious therapy and he took on way too much. I think this book catches him at an incredibly difficult point in his life and I don't think it was the most flattering time for him. I feel for him but I'm still angry at him.- Luke's dad. The school principle's reaction towards him was 100% unrealistic and insane. - Juliet. Was I the only one who thought it was strange that she kept hitting on Nate, even while he was dating her best friend? - The angst up to wazoo. I'm an angst lover but this was even pushing it for me at times. The misunderstandings were out of control. - That ending. I felt like it was a cop out. Overall, I loved parts of this book and hated parts of this book. However, I think that this author is fabulously talented, so I can't wait to read more by her."}, {"userName": "Sean Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2535186-sean-kennedy", "userReview": "[ yes!

It\u2019s romanticised, mythologised \u2013 frequently sanitised \u2013 and at its most beautiful, its most pure, there is no single greater force for good in this world. Yet soured or corrupted, or viewed from aside with a poisoned heart, the hatred it incites is perhaps the most destructive, and it is this \u2013 love and hate, and the price of both \u2013 that Don\u2019t Let Me Go examines \u2013 in often heartbreaking extremes.It\u2019s a basic right, particularly in the Western world, that we may love who we choose, or, should the adage prove true, who our hearts decide we must. Yet many who take this simple freedom granted for themselves do not believe it a right, but a privilege, one earned by merit of religion, the colour of one\u2019s skin, position, or gender.We meet Nate, our narrator, and Adam, the Juliet to his Romeo \u2013 or vice versa \u2013 on page one, which also happens to be the middle of their story. Through a series of flashbacks, Trumble shows the couple\u2019s past and present: sweet romance and horrifying brutality in parallels to a present of petty fights and bickering, of distance which renders hearts strangers, not stronger in their affections. Yet to talk of Don\u2019t Let Me Go in context of romance or of ethical allegory alone is to do it an injustice, for it is so much more than each, or either.It's a story of extremes, of shining love and blackest hate, of marginalization and bullying, and about a gay teen dealing with a world who views him as a thing which must be \u2018dealt with\u2019, rather than a boy with feelings and a beating, hurting heart. Concerned as it is with hate and homophobia (though I suppose the two are, truly, synonymous), it is far more than a simple parable. Dealing with the broader meaning of love than romance alone, family, friendship, and, above all, finding oneself, Trumble handles her characters with sensitivity, warmth and humour. The story\u2019s heartache is balanced with joy, and a love story so tender and pure in its honesty, its messiness, its good and bad, it\u2019s intoxicating. Don\u2019t Let Me Go a \u2018feeling\u2019 book, an emotional one, one driven very much by its vividly real characters.The cast of Don\u2019t Let Me Go is varied and disparate, and amongst its friends and families and heroes, is a love so beautiful and fierce it is humbling to witness. Yet none of them are perfect. Some are certainly more so than others \u2013 Adam\u2019s family, Nate\u2019s grandmother, the lovely Juliet and hilarious Daniel Quasimi among them. Others are profoundly flawed, with Nate \u2013 broken, combative, and self-destructive \u2013 winning that race by a country mile. Nate is not always easy to like. He makes impulsive, foolish decisions, acts in anger and hurts those who love him most. Yet there\u2019s a painful authenticity to his actions, and Trumble doesn\u2019t make excuses for her characters, showing them simply as they are: human. Despite his failings, readers will find in Nate a sympathetic hero, even more so as his story and history unfolds in heartbreaking clarity.Four hundred years ago Shakespeare penned his now famous maxim on the path of love and, while comic in context, it rings, loudly, true in Don\u2019t Let Me Go. Marrying (500) Days of Summer and Hannah Harrington's Speechless with the raw emotional authenticity of Brigid Kemmerer's Elemental series, Don\u2019t Let Me Go is a powerful story with a profound message.Don\u2019t Let Me Go starts with goodbyes, and ends with hope, with promise of a future just beyond a not-so-distant horizon. It\u2019s not possible to take the journey through this tale without seeing horrifying truths and the blackest sides of humanity, but, ultimately, it is \u2018much to do with hate but more with love,\u2019 and it is this \u2013 love \u2013 which makes it such a powerful story. Interwoven with a deep appreciation of music, a warm sense of humour, and profound understanding of how much our world needs books such as this, and needs to have such conversations, Don\u2019t Let Me Go is a gem \u2013 one uncut and unpolished, authentic and untainted, and immeasurably precious.I sometimes wish simply saying 'read this book\u2019 were enough \u2013 because this book has something very important to say, and to teach, and it's also (when it's not utterly heartbreaking) an absolute joy to read. So perhaps I'll say it anyway, if I may: Read this book. And love. Above all things, in all things, love."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "I really wanted to love this book. I moved heaven and earth to find it. Well, not really - I searched all of my local libraries, and the nearby bookstores. I couldn't buy it on Amazon in case my mom got to it before I did. I resorted to ordering it through Barnes & Noble, and I'm still not sure why Don't Let Me Go was so difficult to obtain.It's like gay chick-lit, but better. The story revolves around Nate Schaper, a high school senior who has already found his soul mate. Nate and Adam are inseparable, bonded by true love that has survived huge amounts of homophobia - even a heinous hate crime. But when Adam graduates and gets an acting job in New York, their relationship is put to the ultimate test.There should me more books like Don't Let Me Go. I loved how J.H. Trumble addressed homosexuality and how tough it can be to be gay in high school. She took a sensitive and honest approach to coming out, cycles of abuse, and gay/straight friendships. Her care for the characters appeared prominently on every page.Before I get into why I didn't love the book, I want to make it clear that I have every intention of reading Trumble's next novel. Her writing is raw and sincere, and her utilization of flashbacks uniquely fleshed out the characters. I only wish she had showed some of the scenes instead of telling them. However, the romance in the novel was real and intense and made me wish that I had a boyfriend. Perhaps that's how girls feel when they read books like Anna and the French Kiss.Now, the only reason I'm giving this book three stars instead of five is Nate. Nate. Schaper. It's taking every ounce of my self-control not to just rant about him. As the protagonist of the book and the narrator, I did empathize with him. I understood how hurt and vulnerable he was. But there comes a time when characters cross the line from emotionally distraught and damaged to acting like an insensitive, immature idiot. Almost every single plot problem arose from his insecurity or his inability to communicate like a mature human being. The pain I felt for Adam cut way deeper than the pain I felt for Nate. He deserved a sharp slap across the face, or something that would wake him from his slumber of stupidity.Don't get me wrong, I still recommend this book, especially to those searching for a great story centered on a gay relationship. Just get ready to put up with a protagonist who is not exactly likeable.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."}, {"userName": "Brigid", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3973089-brigid", "userReview": "Okay, so this book was amazing.

The whole story was just beautiful and fulfilling and ... seriously, I just want to hug Nate. You know how sometimes you read books and you want to shake people and say, \"You need to read this book!!\"? This is that book. This book made me want to be a better writer. There is some sexuality and language in this book (no explicit sex, but a few occasional explicit references to sex), but everything suited the story perfectly, and everything was true to each character.I know some reviews mentioned that they had a problem with the time line. The story is told in alternating periods of current time and flashbacks, but I thought it was exactly what the story needed. It was very reminiscent of Barry Lyga's Boy Toy.Seriously. Read it.

I absolutely love the premise and I totally swooned over the cover. Other reviewers compared this to works by David Levithan and John Green, so I was expecting to be wowed.And I was. Just not in a good way.To be fair, I am not gay. I am also not a guy. So I have no idea what it's like to be a recently-out 17-year-old high school boy. But I DO read a fair bit of GLBT YA fiction, so I'm not completely unfamiliar with the genre.I have so many problems with this book that I don't even know where to begin. Which is why I'm so glad that I took notes on my Kindle, once I started getting really annoyed.1. In this book, everyone who is not gay is either: 1) head-over-heels in love with someone of the opposite sex who IS gay (taking \"fag hag\" to an extreme); 2) a mother or a sibling of someone who is gay; or 3) a hateful person who spews vitriol at every opportunity and beats up homosexuals. I mean, EVERYONE. Parents. Friends. Schoolmates. Strangers. There isn't a single person who is indifferent or supportive.2. All gay guys look like this:No, wait. This is okay.3. If you are of any sort of ethnic heritage, people automatically cannot pronounce your last name. Because there are so few non-Caucasians in Texas.4. School administrators don't care if students are bullied, assaulted, or attempt suicide. Or are beaten by their parents.5a. Some cheating is okay, but just don't get caught! 5b. Even if your ex wants to fool around, you don't HAVE to! No one is forcing you, no matter how much he begs and pleads! Seriously. Stop being such a baby about it.6. Gays need bodyguards.7. Teenagers don't know anything about blogs.8. The timelines and chronology were all over the place, which made the story really hard to follow. There were random sections with a lot of unnecessary detail: re-stringing a guitar; tuning a guitar; the temporormandibular joints (just say TMJ!); and playing football.9. The mid-story angst--the arc of the story that is supposed to tug at your heartstrings and make your stomach plummet with dread--felt very forced. And then there was swine flu! And a huge fight (or four)! And OMG, I should feel something! But no.By the time I got to the epilogue, I wasn't sure I could handle the inanity of last few pages: everyone is happy and in love and making babies and seeking closure to those few drama-filled days from TEN YEARS AGO.I am actually debating whether or not to request a refund from Amazon.

Not since I read Maria McCann's As Meat Loves Salt have I actually let my emotions meld with those of the characters themselves. I fell in love with these characters. I got angry at them. I felt their pain and their loss and their joy. There were at least eight times when I had to turn the book over and set it aside for a moment because I was so upset at what they had done. Once, I actually punched the book. Punched it. For real. I read this book voraciously, whenever I had the time. I was actually angry when I had to be somewhere else and counted the minutes until I could be home again reading.Ms. Trumble's writing is very true; the voices are real. Each character felt distinct to me in every way. I could envision each of them in my mind and hear them talking. The prose felt natural and flowed like listening to someone tell me an amazingly emotional story.I am glad I found this book. I am glad I got to read it. As much as I wanted to punch many of the characters in the face, I suppose that is a sign of good writing; the fact that I cared that much is rare.

It made me feel more then many of the books I have read combined. It has gone not only days, but weeks, and I find myself thinking about it. Nate and Adam was a excellent couple, I loved them both so much. It's a lovely story about first love.This books starts when they have been together a year are as happy that any couple can be. Their happy but angst filled past, are told in flash backs. Something I don\u00b4t normally like, but the author makes it work. She is a fantastic writer. If any couple are meant to be it is Adam and Nate. That is obvious through the whole book. But their relationship begins to weaken when, newly graduated Adam, gets a job in New York and he and Nate are forced to a long distance relationship. Trust issues begins to take a toll on their relationship, and maybe they aren\u00b4t so strong as they and everyone else think?This is not only a excellent love story, it also contains some serious topics like homophobia.The language is very easy to get in to, and the author sure knows how to make the reader turn the page. I am so glad I have read this book and one of the guys, Adam, has qualified to be one of my book boyfriends. He must be one of the most perfect guys in the world, honestly. So if you are looking for a compelling read between two guys that are destened to be, but also with some real life matters, then \nDon\u00b4t let Let Me Go\n is the book for you. This beautiful novel is one of the best books I have read lately and it will stay with me for a long time. Even if you don\u00b4t usually read m/m novels, I really recommend this!

This wonderful book is exactly the opposite. We get to see Nate and Adam when they are young, just coming to terms with their being gay. We get to see them struggling with family and school and hate crime while coming out. We get to see what happens to them (and many others) when one half of a high school love affair moves away. Then we get the epilogue, ten years later.This was such a great book. I felt so much of what the characters were feeling. I found myself smiling, laughing, crying and feeling actual anxiety like I was living their situation. I know, it's pathetic to be that involded with fictional characters. But, that's the thing. Nate, Adam, Luke, Danial and Juliet are so well written, that I was able to feel like I was there with them. I can name on one hand the books that have made me feel this close to the characters.Don't Let Me Go is appropriate for YA. It is clean, the sex is handled delicately and I believe young people who are struggling with or coming to terms with their homosexuality will easily identify with these characters. That said, I am a 47 year old woman and I identified with them. Anyone who is or has ever been a teenager (and who hasn't?) will feel things and remember their own high school experience.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Not just for lovers of M/M romance, although it is at heart, a gay romance. It is also a story about friendship, being a parent, being a child and all the mistakes we all make in life and redemption for some of those mistakes."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9104633-jason", "userReview": "4.5 Because Nate & Adam aren't Ben and Tim (although this novel is by far more sophisticated).... and epilogues are so cheap.I also demand, as do many others, that J.H.

However, given the great depth and the author\u2019s adept skill with the exploration of m/m adolescent relationships and life in general, and her keen awareness of straddling real, raw subject matter, yet not sensationalizing it, I feel obligated to provide some trigger warnings.T.H Trumble has tremendous strength in her ability to traverse dark/tragic/horrifying topics, in a manner that avoids the heavy handedness that other authors take up when writing similar novels. This method is painfully more realistic and hurtful. She omits things, creating unbearable tension. Sickening, unbearable, uncomfortable tension. It was written like a slow churning horror story, with parental abuse, LOTS OF BULLYING, suicide, sexual assault, and homophobia at its center. I have encountered \u2018mild\u2019 homophobia, but this wasn\u2019t what set me on edge. The events surrounding the sexual assault, which slowly materialized, had me clutching my boy parts, grabbing the couch cushions and shoving the book away. I\u2019ve never been sexually assaulted. This represents the power of this book. Again, this is a strikingly accurate portrayal of growing up gay.This novel is difficult to review, partly because it is two different perspectives, the past and the present, but also because it is so scrumptiously captured, a feat for all YA to cower by its giant feet, that I feel I\u2019ll f it up. As most high school loves begin, Adam and Nate meet in a hallway over a banana and a bullying incident. The flirtatious spark that ignites is hard to ignore, and as their two lives intertwined, with a very flashy-the-opposite-of-modest-redhead Juliet as adhesive binding the couple, it intensifies. Things are all sad for a while for jealous Juliet, but she gets over it; barely. It\u2019s junior year, for Nate, and senior year for our handsome Adam.As Nate recounts his past, much of it pleasant, an overwhelming amount not so much, the reader sits among memories of coming out, the integration of their sexuality/sexual identity with their parents, friends, and school their intimacy blooms. There is bliss, as the two fortify against covert homophobia, non-verbals and whispers, and verbal, physical/sexual abuse, and other forms of overt homophobia. Adam holds a figurative, and sometimes physical, hand out for Nate, literally stifling a reenactment of Carrie. They go to plays. They drink coffee and eat with Adam\u2019s stepfather and mom. They exchange sweat, spit, and\u2026 They go to parties, exposing a hesitant, but sometimes welcoming crowd to same sex relationships. They hold hands in public. They challenge conformity, both of a heterosexual dominate society, as well as gay stereotypes. Then there is the bad. The black plague of modern culture; spiteful venomous hate. After the \u2018event\u2019, Adam and Nate, tormented and torn by guilt, fear, and their own hate\u2014an obvious, harrowing residue from the assault\u2014, as a couple retain a solid frame. It is worth noting that T.H Trumble brilliantly conveys, not only the event itself, but the tragedy that befalls a person, a couple, and a community. PTSD is handled respectfully and accurately. She does this, not through a shock-porn lens, but carefully and delicately, through an exploration of the outfall, the court proceedings, and ever so slightly touching on the actual event. It isn\u2019t graphic per se, and it certainly is on the other side of the continuum of Flynn, waving and yelling, \u201cThis is how It\u2019s done, bitches\u201d. Then there are the self inflicted wounds of being in a relationship, which are almost has bad as the wounds they inflict on one another.On the shores of a beach, and after a disclosure from Adam, we watch as Adam and Nate, ever resolved in the survival of their relationship and attentive to each other\u2019s needs\u2014though, you know, Adam more than Nate\u2014, agree to a long distance relationship. Adam is thrust into New York, as an actor. Nate, still damaged from an atrocious and gut-wrenching sexual assault that still makes me want to give my tonsils a boat ride in the nearest toilet, remains in the turbulent undertone of past trauma. Juliet, the conjoined twin of Adam and Nate, is still there, though, and she offers stability. There is one other special guy that is a huge ally. There is Danial, a handsome fellow with Pakistani roots. Nate and Danial grow close, and soon Juliet, the ever so tag-along, cuddles up to the two. As always, Juliet the instigator, unable to fully recognize that she won\u2019t ever have Nate, continues her dance for whomever is attentive. One of them becomes her bed partner. Nate and Danial become closer, and Nate, all high up on one of Danial\u2019s vices, sorta kinda has a Jack (Will and Grace) moment, or two. He becomes Nate\u2019s confidant, and eventually, when shits the minor and then huge fan, Adorable Danial becomes somewhat of a knight. It really is fucking adorable! All.of.it. all.of.it.Alone, except for Juliet and eventually Danial, Nate no longer has the restraint provided by Adam. He basically announces at a loud speaker, \u201cFuck that noise\u201d. He does this as only Nate could; though a t-shirt protest, an ever growing fan and ally, supportive peers, and a blog. The whole world, or at least the school, screams back with equal might, both for and against equality. Slowly, but singlehandedly, Dearest Lovable Nate scissors through the sinew, revealing both hate and love, forcing the hateful, the victims, and the bystanders, to bare swords. And boy do they go at it. Dance-ins, public displays of affection, protesters, t-shirts and more t-shirts AND MORE, principals being the assholes my generation knows they can be, teachers struggling to sustain an ethos of hate while others stretch thumbs up to the sky. It all happens, it all happens. Adam and Nate\u2019s relationship continues during this year. While they have a few face-to-faces, and these really only allot for brief tosses between the sheets, the majority of their interactions are restricted to online. Skype dating becomes as annoying as one of those singing Hallmark cards. Skype slowly makes for the exit, as texting and brief phone calls take its place. Confusion, manipulation, and infractions abound. I could relate to Nate. I could relate to Adam. That was scary stuff. The end result may or may not be what one initially expected. At the start of the t-shirt protest a new face graces Nate\u2019s life; fucking Sad Clown Luke (FSCL). FSCL is a sophomore, closeted, growing up in a household smothered in masculinity. He is stuck to Nate like a Chinese finger trap. He is whiny, manipulative, and has a myriad of character flaws. The impact FSCL has on Adam and Nate is smoldering at first, but as Danial waves a warning finger, it seems far to late for even the largest gaggle of firewo/men to extinguish. It seems avant garde for T.H Trumble to make the choice she made\u2014at the very end of the book\u2014, one that seems so out of character for Nate. For a boy who was stripped of his integrity and then carefully rebuilt it, this seemed far from what he was capable of, even if it was \u201cTime for Luke\u201d, or whatever the line.This is a gay anthem, and that warrants repeating, however, it wasn\u2019t without its faults. The division between past and present was dizzying, kaleidoscopic, and I struggled with it until about half way in. I could say that this was a unique way to help the reader orient him/herself to Nate\u2019s troubling past and questionable future, but this would be way, way beyond a reach. Once finished I can reflect back on the structure of the book and tip my hat to Trumble. She fully embraced the style, and did it expertly, but at times the flipping between time periods was distracting, and I feel strongly that it detracted from the overall book. I liked it, but I wished that the corset\u2019s laces were less slack.The incident between Nate, Luke, Luke\u2019s father, and the assistant principal was bewildering. Perhaps the level of accountability, and the management, both legally and ethically, is far different up here in the north, but I don\u2019t believe any principal would leave himself culpable and responsible for the ramifications of protecting Luke\u2019s father, at least not to that degree. One of my other complaints was the way sexual acts were portrayed. Trumble held such a delicate finger over the subject matter, that sometimes it was so vague and translucent. There was one scene, towards the end, that really required further exploration, mainly because of the configuration of the two people and their moral compass, but also because of issues pertaining to sexual experience. In my opinion this would have clearly been a place brimming with emotions, emotions that we, as readers, should have been a part of. Likewise, I found it troubling that Nate and Adam\u2019s sex life was so cryptic, that it deviated from their physical displays of public intimacy. Other than the repeated line of orifices hurting\u2014I kid you not, and this playful wording contrasted sharply with the delicate portrayal of sex\u2014, we really didn\u2019t get to witness the emotional context of sex. Defining sex and appraising its emotional value for each character was an important portion of the last few chapters, and we didn\u2019t have anything for comparison because of the way it was handled earlier. The worst of worst, though, was the 10-year jump. It\u2019s endlessly tiring to see books neatened up in this way. HFN is not a bad thing, and should be an accepted way to conclude a book. Trumble clearly values neat, remarkably swift, and elusive style to writing. Unfortunately, by concluding the book with a hastily raked up epilogue, the spirit of this remarkably successful book suffered. Equally important was that, in an effort to fold the kami as tightly as possible, the pacing was unbalanced and awkward. The author overcrowded these few papers with the ten years of life of Juliet, Luke, Danial, Adam, and Nate. There was so little detail, because the grand swift swipes by the author only allowed for a general abbreviated version. It was a pity. This could have been ended at the 'incident' and picked up in a second book.Overall, a hugely successful and triumphant accomplishment, and an honest and genuine gay anthem. I regard this as one of the more remarkable pieces of gay lit, YA or otherwise. It was expertly written, finely tuned, the characters well conceived, and the overall book was magnificent. I really, really, urge you to read it.As always with these books, I beg you, if you are lonely, hurting, questioning, PLEASE, PLEASE reach out.

All I do remember is putting it on my wishlist and checking the release date every Tuesday for at least a month before I was finally able to download it to my nook. I gotta say, it was well worth the wait.Don't Let Me Go is told from the point of view of Nate, a gay high school senior recounting his relationship with Adam, his first and only boyfriend, and the many events that bind them together. When Adam leaves Texas to work off off-Broadway for a few months, things threaten to fall apart and their love is put through some heavy trials.Let me just say, I had some worries early on, thinking that this could turn out to be some shallow romance story of young gay love (*cough* Boy Meets Boy *cough*), but the more I read, the more I was hooked. There were more than a few nights that I didn't get in bed until 3AM because I didn't want to stop reading. I was just that involved in the story, which is a rarity for me as most books have to fight for my attention. I don't take the world of fiction very lightly, boys and girls.What J.H. Trumble managed to do here was capture that teenage passion and emotion so accurately, it was almost unnerving. Multiple times in the book I would catch something all too similar to my own experiences 10 years ago (sometimes less, but let's not go there), whether it be fights with boyfriends, that dramatically unyielding desire to be with someone or simple interactions between former friends. I could see pieces of myself in Nate, Adam and Luke (a closeted gay boy in Nate's school) to the point where I actually felt embarrassed realizing my own past actions were mirrored on the page. I know so, so many readers, gay or straight, will see themselves there too and it's one of the things that make this book such a valuable read regardless of age, gender or orientation.These characters are so honest and real that their actions can make you sting or your heart melt. I liked these people and enjoyed learning their ins, outs, desires and motivations. Hell, I, the self-professed anti-romance cynic (newly appointed as of Summer 2011) even got misty eyed over moments between Nate and Adam. Granted it didn't make me want to run out and start dating again, but it did remind me of what it felt like to throw yourself into someone heart and soul (read the book, you'll get it), regardless of consequence.If Goodreads allowed half stars, this would be a 4.5, missing the 5 star mark only because I'm stingy with the stars and I have some minor issues with the last 2 chapters. But hey, that's only due to the fact that I'm a cynical bastard with just a few blocks' walk to Thirtiesville.But don't let my curmudgeony attitude deter you. READ THIS! I absolutely loved it and will be pushing it on my friends startinnnnng...now."}, {"userName": "Trisha", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35320405-trisha", "userReview": "Delicious, delicious angst. God knows I love it. And this book delivers it in spades. We jump right into Adam and nate's relationship and are introduced right as they are about to step out of the honeymoon phase. Adam is a year older and heading to New York, while Nate is to stay behind and finish his last year of high school. We are reassured by flashbacks of how much this couple went through to get to where they are (coming out, being harassed, being sexually assaulted, abandoned by parents). Heavy stuff. Somehow, the humor and puppy love between this adorable pair and the characters keeps us readers afloat. But what happens when that love they fought so hard to keep falls apart? As I said before, this story has a lot of angst. The jealousy, petty arguments, insecurity, trust issues...checkmate. Hearts are broken because of the stupidest miscommunication and the characters are so stubborn you may be inclined to throw your kindle or preferred reading device at various points throughout the book. They make things a whole lot harder for themselves.It's annoying, but it's also being in love for the first time at a young age. It's growing up and all of the shit that comes with it. And out of the ashes, the most beautifully broken pieces can come together. I'm old enough to say that now, right? We are all better for breaking!

An sich nichts Ungew\u00f6hnliches, wenn man die Tatsache au\u00dfer Betracht l\u00e4sst, das sie beide Jungs sind. Gerade f\u00fcr Nate ist dieser Umstand neu, denn er hat sich erst vor wenigen Wochen zu einem Outing entschlossen. Wie man sich nun denken kann, st\u00f6\u00dft er damit nicht nur bei seinen Mitsch\u00fclern sondern auch in seiner eigenen Familie auf Unverst\u00e4ndnis und muss sich schlimmsten Anfeindungen und Vorw\u00fcrfen gegen\u00fcberstellen.Doch da ist Adam, der Nate unterst\u00fctzt und in gewissen Situationen ganz besonders besch\u00fctzt. Doch die Anfeindungen und \u00dcbergriffe in der Schule werden immer schlimmer, bis schlie\u00dflich das Unfassbare passiert.F\u00fcr Nate und Adam ist danach nichts mehr wie es war und obwohl man als Leser zun\u00e4chst nicht direkt wei\u00df, was nun genau passiert ist, so ahnt man doch, dass Nate etwas Unglaubliches angetan wurde. Es gibt w\u00e4hrend der Story mehrere Zeitspr\u00fcnge, die aus der Gegenwart erz\u00e4hlen, nachdem Adam an einer Schauspielschule in New York angenommen wurde und dann wiederum aus der Vergangenheit, wie Nate und Adam ihre Liebe f\u00fcreinander entdeckt haben. Adam ger\u00e4t \u00fcber lange Strecken des Buches mehr in den Hintergrund, da Nate die eigentliche Hauptfigur in Don\u2019t let me go ist. Ein starker, entschlossener Junge auf den ersten Blick, doch unglaublich verletzt, einsam und unsicher auf den Zweiten.Man muss mit dem Thema Homosexualit\u00e4t umgehen k\u00f6nnen, um dieses Buch zu verstehen. Das w\u00fcrde ich interessierten Lesern auf jeden Fall raten und ich meine es nicht nur in sexueller Hinsicht. Sicherlich spielt Sex einen sehr zentralen Part in diesem Buch, doch ab einem gewissen Punkt geht die Story viel tiefer, wird eindringlicher und versucht zu sensibilisieren. Sehr unverbl\u00fcmt, sehr realistisch und somit stellenweisen wirklich ungeheuerlich werden die Reaktionen von Menschen beschrieben, die immer noch nicht im 21. Jahrhundert angekommen zu sein scheinen. Eben Menschen, die man an jeder Stra\u00dfenecke dabei beobachten kann, wie sie andere Menschen dem\u00fctigen und dabei nur ihre eigene Schw\u00e4che und ihr Unverm\u00f6gen \u00fcberspielen wollen. Nate beschreibt seinen Alltag, was er f\u00fcr Adam empfindet und wie er von den Menschen um sich herum wahrgenommen bzw. behandelt wird.Er f\u00fchrt ein Blog, um anderen Jungs Mut machen zu wollen, rebelliert f\u00f6rmlich gegen die Anfeindungen auf offener Stra\u00dfe. Zun\u00e4chst wirkte er dabei wie ein Eisberg, an dem alles Negative einfach so abprallt; nur langsam merkt man, wie nahe ihm das alles tats\u00e4chlich geht. Das er Angst hat. Vor allem davor, Adam zu verlieren. Dieser scheint in New York so unglaublich weit weg und baut sich ein eigenes, ein neues Leben in der Gro\u00dfstadt auf. Ein Leben in das Nate, in einer texanischen Kleinstadt nicht mehr hineinpasst. So kommt es Nate jedenfalls vor. Die Beziehung wird durch die Distanz auf eine harte Probe gestellt.Es gibt wenig, was ich an dem Buch auszusetzten habe, denn es wirkt einfach so unglaublich durchdacht und abgerundet. Es ist schockierend, es ist romantisch, es ist sexy, lustig und traurig. Man kann sich eine Track Liste der Songs aus dem Buch bei iTunes runterladen, der Titel des Buches wird zum zentralen Thema und auch das Cover passt perfekt zur Story: ein Junge, der Angst davor hat, sein Gesicht \u00f6ffentlich zu zeigen.An gewissen Stellen hatte ich allenfalls das Gef\u00fchl, das Nate und Adam ihre Beziehung ein wenig zu sehr \u00fcber Sex definieren, dass da ein bisschen zu wenig Gef\u00fchle r\u00fcberkommen. Besonders gegen Ende des Buches gab es eine Stelle, an der ich mit Nates Charakter in einen ziemlichen Zwiespalt geraten bin. Doch im Grunde machte ihn das nur noch menschlicher und zeigte auf, wie verwundbar ein Mensch doch ist. Von dem Ende kann man denken, was man will. Vielleicht war es ein wenig \u00fcberzogen, doch ich fand, es wurde der Story einfach gerecht.Ein Buch, das nicht nur junge Leser wachr\u00fctteln und f\u00fcr mehr Offenheit und Toleranz sorgen will. Denn wie sagt Nate im Buch so treffend: \u201eYou don\u2019t have to understand. You don\u2019t have to agree.

The synopsis intrigued me and I downloaded a sample to my ereader. And boy, am I glad that I did.Don\u2019t Let Me Go is a story of love and hate. Love, because the two main protagonists are in an all consuming relationship; and hate because of the repercussions the two main protagonists have to face as a result of their sexuality.Nate and Adam are madly in love with each other. After skirting around the subject that they may have feelings for the other (and with the added complication of Adam\u2019s best friend, Juliet, trying everything in her power to make Nate her boyfriend), they finally come out to each other and, subsequently, to their friends and family. And their coming out is not without its consequences.Nate falls victim to a horrific and violent attack and is trying to get his life back on track with Adam\u2019s help. Yet when Adam graduates and is offered a part in an off Broadway production (which Nate convinces him to take), it means that Nate has to face his demons on his own. And herein starts the fallout.Combine Nate\u2019s anger at the abusive attitude of his peers, with the fact that Adam\u2019s roommate is blatantly trying to make a play for him and Nate starts to spiral out of control. What follows is a roller-coaster of emotions as we live through Nate\u2019s pain and anger, his love and jealousy, his loneliness and his feelings of abandonment.As Nate starts to realise he is losing Adam, he forms a friendship with Danial who ultimately becomes his savior; and Luke who (I felt) Nate recognises as being a younger version of himself.Told part in flashback and part in present time, the brutality of Nate\u2019s attack is handled sensitively. Whilst it is not told in detail, there is no denying that the events that are hinted at are horrifying and something that no one should have to experience. And, I felt, it was Nate trying to seek closure of some kind on this incident that formed the basis of his relationship with Luke, the younger, more impressionable guy who \u2018fan boys\u2019 Nate and (unwittingly or not) causes the fallout at the end of the book.Throughout this story my allegiances with the four main characters changed with every chapter. I went from loving both Adam and Nate and hating Danial, to loving Nate and Danial and hating Adam, to loving Danial and Adam and being immensely frustrated with Nate; to loving all three of them. As for Luke? I\u2019ll leave let you decide how you feel about him.The relationship between Nate and Adam is told with tenderness and warmth and there was not one single chapter that didn\u2019t pull at my heartstrings particularly towards the end when the relationship between them breaks down completely. The meeting between Nate and Adam at Juliet\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party in particular, had me reaching for my tissues.J.H Trumble manages to use the perfect words and phrases and just the right descriptions to leave you with the warm and fuzzies and with heartache at exactly the same time - and it is for that reason, that I found myself thinking about this story long after I finished it (so much so that I couldn\u2019t do anything else except read it again immediately!). I cried, I laughed, I swooned and I cried some more.The content of Don\u2019t Let Me Go isn't for everyone, but if you are willing to think out of this box, then I would ask you to give this a chance. Because above all, this is a story about relationships - falling in love and learning to be loved; being selfish and being selfless; depending on others and others depending on you; passion and fury; give and take; trust and distrust; promises to break and promises to keep.And as far as promises go, I can assure you this - once you've allowed these characters into your life, you'll never want to let them go."}, {"userName": "Sandra Cortez", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9988899-sandra-cortez", "userReview": "Oh my gooodness I was expecting a sweet M/M YA romance but holy angst.

I didn't like Nate and his voice at the beginning of the book, but surprisingly enough I loved him by the end. I thought he was selfish and self centered, but it turned out that he was one of these complicated characters that unintentionally craved attention just to find a new hiding place. I strongly wanted to strangle Nate, and then wrap him in a fluffy blanket to get him warm and cosy, that's how polarizing this character is.Adam, he is an angel, and I think it might not be even fair enough to call a character that literally light the whole page when its name is spoken an angel. I loved how he handled everything that was going on between him and Nate wisely and lovingly.I might not have liked Luke that much but I felt so sorry for him and maybe shed a tear or two or millions for that matter for him.Danial, Danial Danial, Danial, you Aristotle-ish black-haired love guru!

It wasn\u2019t perfect or completely happy, and it was so refreshing to read about a real relationship since so much of young adult is littered with fairytale romances.I applaud J.H. Trumble for not holding back. Her writing is raw and emotional and real, and you can tell she really cares about what she is writing. Every word is filled with passion, and it shows in Don\u2019t Let Me Go. I cannot wait to read more from this talented author, but it\u2019s going to be pretty hard for anything else she writes to surpass Don\u2019t Let Me Go. But I\u2019m sure she can do it. No pressure, girl!Even if I didn\u2019t agree with the characters all of the time, I liked reading about them. Each and every one felt like a real person. Even the characters that aren\u2019t in the spotlight were very dimensional and realistic. They made me laugh, cry (yes, I cried), scream and shout (okay, not those last two, but you get what I\u2019m saying); the characters are what really makes Don\u2019t Let Me Go a standout piece of work.I don\u2019t know what else I can say besides, read. this. book. Please do it, because even if you don\u2019t think this is something you\u2019d enjoy, I know you will. Unless someone is completely narrow-minded, I don\u2019t see any reason somebody would not enjoy Don\u2019t Let Me Go after they read it."}, {"userName": "Arch Bala", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4261899-arch-bala", "userReview": "Don\u2019t Let Me Go is an emotionally charged book that encompasses the joy and perils of young love between homosexual teens. I\u2019ve a lot of difficulty reading this book because it felt too heavy \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s just hitting closer to home I guess. More than half of the story was in flashbacks and I usually find that annoying but in this book, I\u2019ve this intense feeling of wanting to know more about Adam and Nate.There\u2019s just so much of a reality in this book that at one point, I find myself gritting my teeth in annoyance and perhaps anger. [I just don\u2019t get parents who couldn\u2019t give unconditional love to their child]I loved how the character of Danial puts it about how short life is: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand. You don\u2019t have to agree. Just leave people alone. When I look at the moon and planets and stars, all that narrow-mindedness and hate seem so petty. The universe is such a big place. One hundred thousand light years just from one end of the Milky Way to the other. One hundred. Thousand. Light years. In the time it\u2019s taken for light to travel from one end of our galaxy to the other, thousands of generations have passed. It really makes you realize how small we are, doesn\u2019t it? How short our time on earth is.\u201dDon\u2019t Let Me Go is a stirring narrative of young love, fear, forgiveness, acceptance, defiance, ignorance and most of all \u2013 truth. A book that\u2019s worth every second of your time!Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Edina Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4520379-edina-rose", "userReview": "I don't like stories where one person has to give up his dreams for love. I also don't like stories where the two lovers have an unhealthy interdependent relationship. And I can't stand characters who are self-centred, selfish, whinny and weak. You've got all that in this book, and I can't believe it but I liked the book!?! WTH? I guess I'm changing, or it's this author's magic, or both. Adam and Nate met in their junior year and felt in love. Nate is high maintenance and Adam likes to be his devoted knight. Well, he will pay the price of love. Nate is really a lousy boyfriend. He is weak and calls Adam \"the strong one\". Nate is always taking, barely giving. He is insecure and always thinks the worst. And, to top it up, he cheats. And his reasons for cheating are really weak. I'm still shaking my head thinking about them. Poor Adam. \"He'd forgive me\", thought Nate. And he was right. Adam always forgives, it's what he does. At least the author makes Nate literally grovel at Adam's feet for weeks before he is forgiven. But did Nate learn his lesson?Ten years later, we see them really settled and happy together, so I hope Nate did become a better man."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6261796-wendy", "userReview": "I finished reading this book last night, and I'm still feeling raw. I felt so much while reading Nate and Adam's story. Mostly, I was sad and angry, and the last chapter broke me. Thank goodness there was a HEA, Nate and Adam deserved it after everything they went through. That epilogue not only gave the MC's closure but it gave it to me as well. Don't Let Me Go is the best YA MM book I've ever read. Def recommend it, just have tissues ready, and be prepared for a roller coaster ride."}], "description": "Some people spend their whole lives looking for the right partner. Nate Schaper found his in high school. In the eight months since their cautious flirting became a real, honest, tell-the-parents relationship, Nate and Adam have been inseparable. Even when local kids take their homophobia to brutal levels, Nate is undaunted. He and Adam are rock solid. Two parts of a whole. Yin and yang.But when Adam graduates and takes an Off-Broadway job in New York\u2014at Nate\u2019s insistence\u2014that certainty begins to flicker. Nate starts a blog to vent his frustrations and becomes the center of a school controversy, drawing ire and support in equal amounts. But it is the attention of a new boy who is looking for more than guidance that forces him to confront who and what he really wants.J.H.
