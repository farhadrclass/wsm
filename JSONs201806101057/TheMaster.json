Perhaps 20 books of the 80 or so have been Phenomenal (thanks, 1001 Books to Read Before You Die List). Seriously, the majority of these are at least above average, some of them are true essentials that you mustmust MUST absolutely experience). In that vein, \"The Master\" reigns supreme. Novels about novel-writing are a hit because they embody the \"perfect package\": it's drama about drama, prose about prose, what the unfictitious writer had to do to ultimately get his fiction out there... even whole sets of poetics and stylistic inclinations have a TRUE (dare I add, educational) purpose in these exciting, intrepid endeavors. Yeah, Cunningham hit a home run with \"The Hours\"--his trying to explain a writer's madness somehow allowed it transcendence of the boundaries of time and space. And in Joyce Carol Oates \"Blonde\" (my favorite novel all year), there is a sincere and Godly effort to portray the ARTIST in all her bright and dark dimensions. THE MASTER is a work about the restraint felt by the artist, in this case, the incomparable Henry James, and how every small moment is erected in his mind with hints of feeling and memory. He feels sadness for children--for their future lives that seem so distant and so full of possibility, including, of course, the possibility of demise. For his sister, for mortality; for the new form of novel which could (and in my very humble opinion DID) surpass his own brand of the same.Like Woolf, James is a victim of his age, his society--we all are. But Woolf was intrepid; James was insistent on the PROPER way to write a novel (see also, \"The Art of Fiction\"). His ideas went into his refined and sophisticated art; indeed with so many tuggings and distractions, & clashes with historical events, acquaintances, social gatherings, etc., James became diverted from his clear literary tasks. He is a master of his element, in his element; a brilliant man of unexpected colors.This one, to me, is PERFECT. Yes, a book about the contemplative nature of one of the greatest writers in the English language is, not boring or dull, but magnificent in its courage to properly give the Master back his due. This is one of the greatest of tributes imaginable. It must be said that this stands as a clear example of apprentice beating master. I will read Colm Toibin in the future with enormous expectation."}, {"userName": "Fionnuala", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "I first read this book in 2004. I had chosen to read it because it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, not because it was about Henry James. Thirteen years on, I rarely read books in the Booker shortlist but I'm definitely interested in Henry James so it was with a certain curiosity that I picked this book out of a box I was unpacking and opened up its yellow-tinged pages. In the years since my first reading, I'd always maintained in any discussion about Toibin's books that The Master was the best of his I'd read, partly because of a powerful scene that has remained vivid in my memory, and partly because his book seemed so much better than David Lodge's version of Henry James's life, Author, Author, which I read around the same time (again not because I was particularly interested in Henry James but because I was a fan of David Lodge (though I failed to finish a later book of his so I should probably now call myself an ex fan)).T\u00f3ib\u00edn chose the year 1895 as his starting point for this fictionalised account of the Master's life. James was fifty-three at the time, and living more or less permanently in England. T\u00f3ib\u00edn describes the next four years in great detail, and while the the book is mostly concerned with those years, T\u00f3ib\u00edn also roams back in time to what he clearly regards as significant moments in his subject's experience. He doesn't project forward however even though James lived on until 1916, and wrote what I think of as his best work during that later period: The Wings of the Dove, 1902, The Ambassadors, 1903, and The Golden Bowl, 1904. I'm conscious now of a certain relief that T\u00f3ib\u00edn didn't visit those years in James's life.If I'm giving the impression that I liked T\u00f3ib\u00edn's fictionalised biography less second time round, that is only partly true. The book is sprinkled with excellent paragraphs and it's clear that T\u00f3ib\u00edn has done a lot of research, some of which I was grateful to discover. 1895 to 1898 was the period when James wrote What Maisie Knew, and as I'd just finished reading that book when I picked up this one, finding out what inspired it was interesting. T\u00f3ib\u00edn describes a house party James attended in 1895 where he came across a little girl who seemed to be exposed by her neglectful mother to all sorts of adult occupations and preoccupations. The detailed descriptions T\u00f3ib\u00edn gives of this episode recall certain scenes from The Turn of the Screw which James wrote around the same time as the Maisie book. Since I found those two books quite different from the rest of James's work, and since I was curious about why he picked those themes, T\u00f3ib\u00edn's scenarios helped to satisfy my curiosity. They also underline what seems to be one of the main rationales of T\u00f3ib\u00edn's project: searching for exact parallels between James's life and his books. As I read, I found myself wondering if James would have appreciated such a close investigation of his motivations and inspirations. And apart from my curiosity about the oddity that is What Maisie Knew, I'm not very interested in knowing who or what inspired this or that aspect of James's work. I'm also less interested than I expected to be in the details of his life, who he might have loved, who he might have regretted not loving enough. If he told no one while he was alive, if he carefully edited his letters and papers, and destroyed many of them, it is surely because he wished to guard his privacy. T\u00f3ib\u00edn frequently stresses James's desire for privacy yet he tries to uncover his innermost feelings at every turn. Take the following episode, for example, in which his friends tried to reserve holiday accommodation for James although he'd indicated he hadn't yet made up his mind to travel and would in any case make his own arrangements:Slowly, in the weeks after he received the news that she and Mrs Curtis had been searching for an apartment on his behalf, he felt a powerlessness that he had not felt since he was a child. When I read a sentence like that, I find myself exclaiming, How can you possibly know the strength of his feelings or what they even were in the first place! And why give such banal arrangements so much consequence? I exclaimed more and more frequently as I read on. Here, for instance:In the months that followed neither William nor Henry ever mentioned the name Gus Barker to each other. Each of them felt, Henry guessed, a guilt that they did not wish to admit to, or discuss.So T\u00f3ib\u00edn is guessing at what Henry James might have been guessing about what he himself might have felt. Such pointless speculation really irks me. And the repetitions of 'he felt' and 'he thought' ruin some otherwise good passages, as for example: She came from a distinguished family of alluders, he thought; her mother and her aunt and her uncle the novelist usually succeeded in breaking silence on most matters and did not have many unspoken thoughts. The raised eyebrow and the pointed remark ran in the family, he thought...That passage is otherwise so very like James's writing that it could be directly out of one of his novels. There were other passages that reminded me of James's turns of phrase: Her manners too were brilliant...It was as though a thunder and lightening storm of the happiest kind had arrived by carriage at Lamb House in plenty of time for lunch and was playing itself out cheerfully in the drawing room.In the Afterword, I found this statement from T\u00f3ib\u00edn: I wish to acknowledge that I have peppered the text with phrases and sentences from the writings of Henry James and his family. It would have been nice if those pepperings had been in italics or otherwise signaled but of course that would interfere with the notion that this is a fiction. I asked myself as I read through the book if there was perhaps another way to fictionalise this 'life'. T\u00f3ib\u00edn doesn't give us all of James's thoughts so why give us any? Why not take example from the Master himself - I can think of several characters in his books whose thoughts are never revealed. The characters move about, they speak, they act, but they remain essentially private. I would have liked more of that privacy for Henry James.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 So not only have I become an ex fan of David Lodge, I also seem to have become an ex fan of Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. However, the vivid scene that had stayed in my mind from the first time I read this book was still as good as I remembered it. So not quite an ex fan - more like a vexed fan."}, {"userName": "Kalliope", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope", "userReview": "PROJECTIONS\nComing out of a cinema having watched a film, one often feels, for a very short moment, somewhat astray. But very quickly one\u2019s consciousness grapples to take hold of its position and put the realm of the movie into a contained and defined locus in one\u2019s brain\u2014somewhere on the side, no longer projected at the very back. Only then can one resume one\u2019s life and self, and start chatting to friends about what did they think of the film.With this novel I have felt a similar disconcerting magic that sucked me in and hauled me out from my viewpoint. Somewhat aware of my bewitchment I was anticipating a similar bewildering effect when I would finish the book and closed its back cover and its world and transform it back into the shape of a cardboard box. Yes, not unlike coming out into the open city, after the absorbing and dark session in a cinema.During those reading hours I lived in the Henry James that Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn was projecting so very skillfully.And yet, at times I stirred in my seat. A certain mistrust was unnerving me.May be the fact that T\u00f3ib\u00edn choses to begin with a literary flop in the career of Henry James (HJ) and then follows it with too much of a focus on the (homo)sexual inclinations of his subject.Knowing little about HJ before I began reading The Master, and considering that it was my first two James novels that showed me the beauty of the English language, T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s initial approach did not accord well with my perceptions. Later episodes or comments confirmed my impression that T\u00f3ib\u00edn had set out to catch HJ in his faults.This attitude was particularly problematic when recounting the friendship with and the fatal end of Constance Fenimore Woolson (CFW). May be others too, but certainly T\u00f3ib\u00edn wants to point fingers, in what I consider a dangerous and futile game of \u2018what-ifs\u2019 that are impossible to confirm, and for the most part the result of a simplistic view of cause-and-effect in life, a complex phenomenon. In Spanish we call this the futuribles. T\u00f3ib\u00edn also bites the baited hook tended for literary biographers: looking for the persons who were the source for his fictional characters. HJ\u2019s cousin Minny Temple is one such \u2013 of James\u2019s most famous female personalities, Daisy and Isabel. And I wonder if T\u00f3ib\u00edn himself has not also drawn on real people around him when writing his novels. To veer too much away from real life could also lead a writer to write about what he does not know anything about, as T\u00f3ib\u00edn tells us of HJ\u2019s work \u2018in the French mode\u2019 when he wrote about an adulteress when he was still a very young man. T\u00f3b\u00edn includes Henry\u2019s elder brother William mocking him for this.At times, when tracking the original identities HJ\u2019s success at creating characters is presented as if he had been stealing the life of the persons around him to convert them into fiction on paper; a sort of literary vampire. Or the opposite, so that we also come to the subverted situation in which T\u00f3ib\u00edn reproaches HJ for not making the character quite like the real person.So that Isabel Archer saw what Constance Fenimore Woolson saw and may indeed have felt what she felt, if only he could have fully divined what Constance felt.For T\u00f3ib\u00edn judges HJ. He sees HK not able to empathize enough with his friend CFW. I, however, felt that CFW had also not understood HJ\u2019s need for independence and privacy and may have drawn too many expectations.This quest for Henry\u2019s faults is nonetheless balanced out with the episode that narrates the relationship of the American writer with his problematic servants, the Smiths. Here HJ is portrayed under a warm light and the writer\u2019s generosity is allowed to shine.I also wished we had learnt more about HJ as a writer. A couple of times, his complex sentences are alluded to, and his fastidiousness with language is also amusingly presented when he admonishes his nieces when they say that they are going to \u2018fix\u2019 their hair asking them: \"To fix it to what, or with what?\"All these negative aspects are to justify the missing star in my rating, because, as I have accounted at the beginning of this review, I have felt a very strong pull when reading The Master that disconcerted me strongly. The four stars shine on their own; the difficult one to identify is the missing one.T\u00f3ib\u00edn has succeeded in fascinating me with his account. His fictional rendition of a person who in real life seems to have been despairingly inscrutable to those around him is masterful. His Henry James is so plausible that it has been my resistance to believe in its truthfulness that has led me to wrack my brains attempting to identify the dissonances that could signal to me that his account was a siren\u2019s call. And it has been precisely this push & pull rhythm in his novel that has been captivated and fully engrossed me.Even if I find that I have to try and restore Henry James, the writer \u2013 with his novels."}, {"userName": "Jim Fonseca", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca", "userReview": "The Master is the story of the key life-shaping experiences of Henry James. While we learn a lot about James' life, the book is not at all structured as a traditional biography. It begins late in James' life when he was settled in England and it has him reflect back on these experiences. In particular, three women, very close to him -- an invalid sister, a brilliant favorite cousin, and an author friend died relatively young. Another life-forming event was a summer camp experience with a large group of young people - siblings, friends and cousins, so formative, that in a sense James learned everything he needed to know about people to write his novels from this one experience.James had a lifelong love-hate relationship with his domineering older brother, the psychologists and scholar, William James. Growing up, James lived with his family in Cambridge in Boston and summered among the elite in Newport, Rhode Island. In this insular New England literary culture, James mentions one day he would like to meet Nathaniel Hawthorne. His father had talked with him last week; James, mother and aunt knew all the women in Hawthorne's family, and James' younger sibling went to school with Hawthorne's children. So, a small world in literary Boston.The author, who has written other gay-themed works (Blackwater Lightship) assumes James was a closet gay who never consummated a relationship with man or woman. Thus Toibin focuses many of James' formative experiences along this theme - sharing a bed as a youth with Oliver Wendell Holms, or enduring the inquiries of a good friend who, when names of customers of Oscar Wilde's \"rent boys\" were going to be made public during that affair, pressed James in so many words: \"Well, will you be leaving for France like the others?\" And the criticism, including that by his brother, why a MAN would want to write stories about WOMEN.James did have a love affair -- with a house -- now the Lamb House, open to the public in Rye on England's south coast. There is humor, such as James' drawn-out effort to fire an elderly husband and wife butler-cook team who had become alcoholics. It's a great book; like most of James' work, it is much more interesting than it sounds; indeed it's a fascinating read, and James comes off as aloof but likeable."}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5974610-kris", "userReview": "I loved this book. I thought T\u00f3ib\u00edn did a beautiful job adapting his style to one that was evocative of Henry James, although more easily readable. The novel moves with James to London, Ireland, Italy, and Rye, and effectively integrates James' memories of the past in flashbacks that come as responses to his relationships, tensions, and interactions with others.T\u00f3ib\u00edn has been described as a writer who is keenly interested in his characters' psychology and relationships, and this interest comes to the fore in The Master. James emerges very much as an isolated figure. He worries about how he appears to others, he struggles to maintain his composure, and in his zeal to maintain his privacy, he shies away from intimate relationships with others inside and outside of his family. He even (or especially) shields himself from knowledge of his true identity, particularly with regards to his sexuality. T\u00f3ib\u00edn's style, restrained and formal, beautifully (and sadly) conveys James' isolation and separation.Finally, I also found T\u00f3ib\u00edn's depiction of James's writing process to be revealing. Through chapters that focus on James's relationships with important figures in his life, including his sister Alice, T\u00f3ib\u00edn explores ways in which James used his writing to communicate with, remember, and in some cases make amends to ghosts in his life. I was left thinking about the limitations on intimacy that this approach can lead to - the barriers a writer can erect by being an observer rather than an active participant, the instrumentality of relationships formed and experiences sought primarily to provide material for a novel or play, and the betrayal felt by friends and family when they read James's work only to see themselves appearing as characters."}, {"userName": "Helle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6909470-helle", "userReview": "Life is a mystery and (that) only sentences are beautiful (\u2026) The disadvantage of listening to an audiobook, however mellow and fittingly transatlantic the accent of the narrator, is that one cannot hold on to the sentences. They seem more fleeting when listened to, even when, as in this case, I went back many times to pay more attention to the beauty of a sentence, the significance of a word. And there was much I wanted to hold on to and savour in this gorgeous novel.It is the story of Henry James, of his writing, his family, his friendships, his worries and regrets; his life in solitary, sedentary exile, in self-repression, sexual and otherwise. We meet Henry, as he is called throughout the novel, when his play Guy Domville fails miserably in London. After this disaster, he slowly, finally, turns toward fiction. (On the opening night of his own play, afraid to witness the audience\u2019s response, he attends an Oscar Wilde play, Lady Windemere\u2019s Fan, and utterly dislikes it. Already here we get a glimpse of the sombre figure T\u00f3ib\u00edn paints: Henry James, although an aesthete like Wilde, seemed to embody the very opposite position of the dandified, larger-than-life Oscar Wilde). It is a novel of \u2018startling excellence\u2019, as the reviewer in The Observer stated. As far as I can tell from having so far only read four of James\u2019s novels, T\u00f3ib\u00edn borrows aspects of James\u2019s style such as tone, vocabulary and register, but he is more modern, and he has to a large extent abandoned the overly long sentences that were one of James\u2019s trademarks (and which have made me, I blush to admit, abandon The Ambassadors more than once). The result is one of ponderous beauty as well as a fascinating literary excavation into the emergence of many of James\u2019s stories and characters \u2013 as imagined and interpreted by T\u00f3ib\u00edn. I especially appreciated the direct line he portrays from Georg Eliot\u2019s Gwendolen Harleth in Daniel Deronda + Anthony Trollope\u2019s Lady Laura Kennedy in Phineas Finn + James\u2019s own cousin Minnie to Isabel Archer in The Portrait of a Lady. (Apropos Georg Eliot, I had to smile when Minnie claimed that  you know much more how strange and beautiful it is to be alive after having read The Mill on the Floss than after a thousand sermons. Ah, indeed. I only just read that novel myself a few weeks ago).A few sad truths are indicative of the Henry James we meet in T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s rendition of the Master in this novel:(About how he managed to avoid the American Civil War:) His war was private and further He lived as if his life belonged to someone else; like a character not fully imagined.It is an old-fashioned kind of story, in the very best sense; quietly paced, itself almost sedentary; a novel version of a biography about a refined hermit who devoted his life to his art (even if, at one point, T\u00f3ib\u00edn lets Henry\u2019s brother point out to him that his sentences have become too long!) By employing the Master\u2019s Christian name throughout, T\u00f3ib\u00edn cunningly makes the reader feel that much closer to the writer, as if we are truly offered an intimate insight into his life and his thoughts.I immediately want to read more by Henry James, which was no surprise, and three of his books (two of which I\u2019ve seen film versions of) are already on my to-read list. More unexpectedly, but most emphatically, I want to read more by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. What an imaginative, beautiful feat this novel was!"}, {"userName": "K.D. Absolutely", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "userReview": "The subtle third-person narrative of Tolm Coibin (born 1955) masterfully portrays Henry James (1843-1916) as person in this 2004 Booker-shortlisted novel, The Master. Covering a period of 5 years, 1895 to 1899, this includes his defeat at London Theatre when Guy Domville (1895) flopped, his self-seclusion in Rye East Sussex, flashback to his former life in America, before going back and ending the story in Rye. I picked up this book because this is both a 501 and a 1001 and I have been postponing this book for almost two years now. My brand-new copy then is now starting to yellow so I decided that before the pages become brittle, I have to give it a try. I did not have any prior idea of what the novel is all about except that it was shortlisted in Booker.After 5 pages, I thought of dropping the book and then return it to my bookshelf. The reason: I have not read any James' books (shame on me) except with some sketchy ideas on Daisy Miller which is one of the books included in Azar Nafisi\u2019s Reading Lolita in Tehran. The blurbs on the first few pages of the The Master say that Colm Toibin adapted the Henry James\u2019 style of writing: calm literary realism. And this being a biographical fiction of Henry James life is also my first since I have not also read Michael Cunningham\u2019s The Hours which I heard also uses exactly same the approach: a splice of Virginia Woolf\u2019s life told in Woolf\u2019s stream-of-consciousness style of writing.But I persisted by reasoning to myself that I have to start somewhere. I am glad I did. This is an unforgettable read.There is nothing like it yet: the calm prose of Henry James. His silence as this novel\u2019s main character.Supposing that it is true that Coibin\u2019s style here is exactly the same as James\u2019, I particularly enjoyed his taut, luminescent and deep narration. Normally, a novel with characters not talking is boring for me but this one is different. I never knew that paragraphs and paragraphs of descriptions about what\u2019s going on in a character\u2019s mind can be interesting. Now I know better. If the character is as interesting as Henry James, who wrote the classic excellent novels like The Portrait of a Lady (1881), What Maisie Knew (1897), The Wings of the Dove (1902), and The Ambassadors (1903), among many others, coupled with the masterful prose by someone like Toibin, then definitely it should be a must-read.My favorite parts are those that describe the house in Rye in relation to James\u2019 reminiscences and thoughts. That is the house where James \u201chibernated\u201d after his flopped play in London. The house provides the main backdrop of this novel and it feels like it has a life of its own (just like the clock tower in Virginia Woolf\u2019s Mrs. Dalloway) by the way Toibin described it in the James-like prose that is akin to an impressionist painting: vivid and detailed, depicting the right lighting and the right angle yet achieved with very minimal brushstrokes. For example, the first time Henry entered the house (descriptions: blah blah), while looking around, he saw his room (descriptions: blah blah). It dawned on him that it will be the place where he would die. What with the 21 years of mortgage and he was already 52. I cannot even paraphrase the blah-blah\u2019s because obviously I am neither Colm Toibin nor Henry James.For me, the main message of The Master is at some point in the second half of our lives, we need to look back and reflect on the first half to know where we are going or how we want to spend the rest of it. We get setbacks, yes, but those points should not stop us from what we want to do. Rather, those should inspire us to do more. While in seclusion, James reflected on the series of deaths (mother, father, sister Alice, cousin Milly, a friend) in the family and felt almost alone in his house by the bay in Rye except towards the end of the story when his elder brother William, his wife and daughter visited him. I mentioned those deaths because each of them brought out who James was (at least in the eyes or imagination of Toibin): calm yet profound, loving yet detached, artistic yet devoid of dramatic nuances. After his 5-year stay in Rye, he was 57, he bounced back and wrote most of his more \u201ccomplete\u201d (his word; with The Ambassadors as what he called to be his favorite work) novels. Just to drive home the point that sometimes we have to slowdown or even stop, reflect, wind up, then continue what we were doing and possibly achieve greater success in life. Definitely, I will be reading some of the works of Heny James soon and probably pick up another book or two by Toibin.P.S. Colm Toibin is an all-out gay. Henry James was said to be gay too. His contemporary was Oscar Wilde who was an outlandish and scandalous (according to this book) gay. There are implied homosexual acts in the book but not as descriptive as in Augusten Burrough\u2019s Running With Scissors. Well, I should not have compared this masterpiece to that trashy memoir in the first place but I just want to give you a strong contrast just to point out that this, The Master is a must-read book for those who love the works of Henry James and of course Colm Toibin. But still if you are squeamish about gay love, this book is not for you."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul", "userReview": "Thoughtful and well considered novel about a short period in the life of Henry James the novelist. It is set in the late 1890s when James lived in Rye and is entirely told from the point of view of James and is placed in his interior life. James is not an author I have read; apart from some of his shorter stuff, but that didn't present any problems in reading and appreciating the book. The basic knowledge I had about his life and family was enough.This novel moves slowly and is very descriptive,but is none the worse for that. James's reluctance to become too close to anyone is delicately observed and the oft debated question of his sexuality is explored in an oblique way through well described flashbacks and current encounters. The relationships with the novelist Constance Woolson and the sculptor Henrik Anderson and James's reticence: his wish to be private and alone conflicting with his wish to be close to someone. Aloneness won. There are interesting accounts of his relationships with his formidable family.Beautifully written, rather slow, James was somewhat infuriating in his reticence. I wanted to shake him and make him express some passion, grab one of his adored but distant objects and feel some human warmth (the bloke, the girl; I didn't care which; as they weren't around at the same time, preferably both). It may be that it was that very reticence, being an observer rather than a participator that made him the novelist he was. I ended up feeling rather sorry for him."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve", "userReview": "\u201cNuanced\u201d is one of those great homological words. (\u201cPolysyllabic\u201d is the usual example \u2013 a word that describes itself.) When multiple blurbs for a book call it nuanced, you can bet it\u2019ll feature more in the way of inner life and less in the way of plot. Of course, this can be good or bad depending on how skilled the writer is, how interesting the drill-downs are, and the extent to which the M.O. might otherwise be hackneyed or boilerplate. It\u2019s like jazz standards. I\u2019m not talking about the ivory tickler at Joe\u2019s Piano Bar in Des Moines \u2013 all glissandos and grace notes; I\u2019m thinking more like Jarrett, Peacock and DeJohnette, where nuance is everything. We already know the tune, so our favorite jazzmen can play us the complements instead, merely hinting occasionally at the melody. The indirections alter our balance just enough to enjoy the ride. Often it\u2019s the notes they don\u2019t play that are the most transcendent. (Thanks, Thelonious, for that insight.) Before I get too carried away, I should say what must already be obvious: The Master is nuanced. In a good way. The standards are themes like love, longing, grief and regret. Toibin comes at these in an understated way, with subtlety and refinement to spare.This is an interesting slice of biographical fiction based on the life of American-English writer Henry James. The action, such as it is, takes place from 1895 to 1899 in England and the continent. There is conflict, as any good book must include, but it\u2019s usually the personal kind. Toibin\u2019s account begins as Henry\u2019s new foray into play writing is given a bad reception. Meanwhile, Oscar Wilde\u2019s new play at a rival theatre was packing them in. For something to do the night his own play opened, Henry witnessed Wilde\u2019s production, where \u201cas the curtain rose and the audience began to laugh at lines which he thought crude and clumsy, he felt under siege. He did not laugh once; he thought not a moment was funny, but more importantly, he thought not a moment was true. Every line, every scene was acted out as though silliness were a higher manifestation of truth. No opportunity was missed in portraying witlessness as wit; the obvious and shallow and glib provoked the audience into hearty and hilarious laughter.\u201dLooks like Henry was quite the earnest highbrow, perhaps concluding that Wilde lacked nuance. Toibin did a good job going back and forth in time to give the context needed to understand the present-day Henry and his complicated relationships with people. One of these relationships was with Oliver Wendell Holmes who he knew from school days at Harvard. Here\u2019s another snippet that reveals more about Henry\u2019s perceptions (and Toibin\u2019s fine writing) as it applies to Holmes and other Americans Henry had known who later became famous.\"When they came to England, they appeared mysterious to him, so confident, so adept at finishing their sentences, so used to being listened to, and yet they seemed to him, compared to men of their kind in England and France, oddly raw and boyish, their brashness a kind of innocence.\"Another friend was the writer Constance Fenimore Woolson. She was also an American who lived in Europe. They travelled together, critiqued works of art together including each others, and might have become closer still had they both been the right types. Sadly, as Henry wrote to another friend, \u201cshe had always been a woman so little formed for positive happiness that half one\u2019s affection for her was, in its essence, a kind of anxiety.\u201dBefore the book, I knew next to nothing about James aside from the fact that he was prolific and from a famous family. His father was a prominent intellectual, his brother William was a famous philosopher and psychologist, and his sister Alice was a noted diarist. Toibin\u2019s meticulous research provides what I\u2019m sure is the real deal. And there\u2019s plenty to be learned. To give the account even more authenticity, his text includes bits taken from letters by James, his friends and his family. Those familiar with James\u2019s books say that Toibin captured the voice well with his ornate sentences and keen observations. The back cover likened it to Michael Cunningham\u2019s book The Hours. Henry was sometimes hard to figure. His reluctance to act often had repercussions that were every bit as consequential as dramatic actions would have been. Several people \u2013 a favorite cousin, his sister, his friend Constance \u2013 expected him to share more of himself with them, but he was bound to disappoint, often using his work as an excuse. Then there was a failure to act on certain other impulses, which I\u2019ll come to in a moment. His brother William observed another aspect of his nature, fairly or not:\u201cI believe the English can never be your true subject. And I believe that your style has suffered through the strain of constantly dramatizing social insipidity. I think also that something cold and thin-blooded and oddly priggish has come to the fore in your content.\u201dBooks like this which rely heavily on a sense of period often focus on manners, it seems. This may be especially true where the n-word (nuance) is involved. Isn\u2019t Jane Austen described as being all about manners? With her it was always women seeking men. With this one, it\u2019s man seeking, uh, we\u2019re not really sure, but it\u2019s pretty clearly from a vantage point deep within the closet. The impulses I mentioned earlier, felt but not pursued, fall under this category. You can read as much into this as you want, but to me it was just another part of a man with more going on beneath the surface than above it.Graced with nuance, the cowardice, the guilt, and the extreme sensitivity that would typically form an unsympathetic figure are combined with more redeeming traits to create an interesting composite. I wasn\u2019t always sure I liked the guy, but he had a lot of facets to consider. The only knock I have against the book is that with all the long descriptions, my mind would sometimes wander. That said, it often wandered in entertaining directions \u2013 character parsing and the ineffable way of folks. All in all, it was a solid 4-star experience."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "9.\tThe Master (2004), Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn The Master is a novel by Irish writer Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. The Master depicts the American-born writer Henry James in the final years of the 19th century. The eleven chapters of the novel are labelled from January 1895 to October 1899 and follow the writer from his failure in the London theatre, with the play Guy Domville, to his seclusion in the town of Rye, East Sussex, where in the following years he rapidly produced several masterpieces. The novel starts with a portrait of Henry as a public figure who feels humiliated in an unexpected way, not just in the public side of his writing career but also in a more personal way, in which all the precautions he had taken to carry on with his life as he wished it to be, come to a crisis. Henry resolves to reduce his public life by buying a house in Rye and there he nurses his loneliness and is haunted by all the consequences his need to maintain a protected space in which to live and write has generated all through his life. He's in his fifties and he's very much aware of how he had to refuse the company of his ill sister, whom he adored, at some point, how he chose to stay away from his country and his family, how he felt to turn cold with a writer friend he had been very close to previously and becomes a bachelor with an unresolved sexuality, certainly close to homosexuality, living in a house with servants in the South of England and a daily visit of the stenographer to whom he dictates. The portrait of Henry, a man appalled by the Oscar Wilde case while repressing his self and his sexuality, shows a complex and ambiguous man. He copes with life by exerting control over how much he'd reveal, even to himself, and choosing to be a writer in order to achieve precisely that.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u067e\u0627\u0646\u0632\u062f\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u0633\u0627\u0644 2011 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u06a9\u0648\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0648\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0644\u0646\u062f \u0642\u0631\u0646 21 \u0645\u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "Description: The Master tells the story of Henry James, a man born into one of America's first intellectual families two decades before the Civil War.

Sometimes in the night he dreamed about the dead - familiar faces and the others, half-forgotten ones, fleetingly summoned up. Now as he woke, it was, he imagined, an hour or more before the dawn; there would be no sound or movement for several hours. He touched the muscles on his neck which had become stiff; to his fingers they seemed unyielding and solid but not painful. As he moved his head, he could hear the muscles creaking. I am like an old door, he said to himself. Not being much of a Henry James fan I didn't mind the implications, yet do wonder if this was slightly bitchy.

(Because there are other James family members appearing throughout, in person and in recollection, I refer to Henry James as Henry rather than as the customary James.)Although the eleven chapters focus on the events taking place during specified months, beginning with January 1894 and ending with October 1899, the narratives within often slide backwards in time, following Henry\u2019s thoughts as present actions remind him of past events. His mind is not bound to the times specified by the chapter titles. Not having been that familiar with Henry\u2019s life, as I read I would frequently take time out and explore biographical information about other characters (like Alice James, Constance Fenimore Woolson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Minny Temple) and stated events just to see how grounded this novel is in biography. What I discovered certainly matched up with how people and events are portrayed in the novel. Even though T\u00f3ib\u00edn has based the core of the novel on solid research (he credits Leon Edel\u2019s five-volume biography with the place of honor in his acknowledgements), this book soars far beyond biography because of the author\u2019s imaginative invention of Henry\u2019s state of mind.For me, the quiet and restrained tone of the novel speaks clearly about the personality of a man who has spent a lifetime approaching then running from people important to him and from his understanding of his own life. He lives in denial of his less than loving behavior towards his sister Alice, his cousin Minny Temple, and his dear friend Constance Fenimore Woolson. He invites them to visit him, to be a part of his life, then abandons them in fear of further responsibility or intimacy. Sometimes his retreats have devastating effects on those he loves. We see him bury his knowledge of his unloving actions, as he also buries his knowledge of his shortcomings, of his sexuality, of his feelings towards his family. An especially strong passage in the novel portrays the struggles between Henry and his older brother William. This part of the book crackles with reality, even though T\u00f3ib\u00edn has invented the conversations between these men. And there are other scenes like this one, which are too surprising and too satisfying to spoil by hinting at them here.T\u00f3ib\u00edn portrays Henry\u2019s interpretations of and imaginings about what is going on around him act as \u201csources\u201d of literary works written during 1994-1999 (like What Daisy Knew and \u201cThe Turn of the Screw\u201d) and also of those greatest novels written shortly after 1899 (The Ambassadors, The Wings of the Dove, and The Golden Bowl). Readers familiar with Henry\u2019s writings will hear echoes of them throughout.In its very quiet way this novel grip its readers and make us feel we are there.

He grows more revered and unread with each passing decade. Shifting tastes, including a century of sensory overload, have rendered his social and emotional precision almost invisible. Students still struggle through his ghost story, \"Turn of the Screw,\" but he's otherwise drifted off high school reading lists. When forced to confront \"Portrait of a Lady\" or \"The Ambassadors,\" college students find him effete, boring, obsessed with irrelevant issues of class structure and manners. It doesn't help that we pretend there is no class structure in America; there are certainly no manners.James was not unaware of the problem of finding an audience. His older brother William, the legendary psychologist at Harvard, suggested that his novels were insipid and priggish. His effort to take London by storm led to one of the most disastrous opening nights in theatrical history. He depended on the family fortune to sustain him when - frequently - writing couldn't.Whatever his struggles for an audience, he enjoyed particularly good fortune in attracting a biographer. Leon Edel spent the better part of his career chronicling James's life in five volumes, which won a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award.And now James has seduced a novelist commensurate with his own sensibilities. \"The Master,\" a new biographical novel by Irishman Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, reflects all the brilliance and challenge of Henry James's work, sweeping through the author's life and mind with a scope that's both broad and precise. It's not likely to win any new fans for James, but lapsed ones should feel roused by it, and members of the cult will embrace \"The Master\" as a new testament.T\u00f3ib\u00edn narrates in the omniscient third person, focused on James's perspective, a kind of \"What Henry Knew.\" The carefully labeled chapters, starting with \"January 1895\" through \"October 1899,\" belie the novel's extraordinarily complex and fluid structure.T\u00f3ib\u00edn seems to have memorized the voluminous journals, letters, and published works of the whole eccentric James clan, allowing him to re-create conversations and interior monologues with remarkable fidelity. He enjoys total command of the decades that were the foundation for these five years, and tends to refer to events and people long before they've been clearly identified for us. Indeed, anyone less familiar with James's life, which is likely to include everyone but Leon Edel, will experience periods of bewilderment, but for those with the stamina to persevere, the rewards here are extraordinary.The novel opens in London during preparations for \"Guy Domville,\" a play James wrote when he sensed (incorrectly) that his days as a novelist were over. \"He awaited the opening night,\" T\u00f3ib\u00edn writes, \"with a mixture of pure optimism - an absolute certainty that the play would hit home - and a deep anxiety, a sense that worldly glamour and universal praise would never be offered him.\"Too nervous to watch his own opening, he attends Oscar Wilde's \"An Ideal Husband\" nearby and loathes it. \"The writing, line by line, was a mockery of writing,\" he thinks, \"an appeal for cheap laughs, cheap responses.\" Leaving Wilde's smashing success, he walks back to his own theater in time to receive a torrent of boos and catcalls.The experience - with its particularly public dimension - devastates him and throws him back into fiction with grim expectations. But T\u00f3ib\u00edn catches in James's response a mingled sense of humiliation and superiority: \"He had failed, he realized, to take the measure of the great flat foot of the public.\"Meanwhile, Wilde's spectacular success aggravates his disappointment and envy further (another one of Wilde's plays opens in the theater that \"Guy Domville\" exits). It also introduces a major theme in \"The Master\": James's ambiguous sexual orientation, treated here, like everything else in this story, with exquisite subtlety.James listens hungrily to news of the playwright's outrageous behavior with a strictly enforced air of casual detachment. He's too elegant to gloat over Wilde's trial, too terrified to pant over Wilde's exploits. This portrayal of intense but unarticulated desire is a triumph of wit and psychological precision. Another scene of James lying awake all night next to a naked and presumably straight Oliver Wendell Holmes is even funnier and just as brilliant.As the novel moves through James's relationships with his sister, his cousin, a friend's butler, and a young sculptor, we see again and again the same tension between his attraction to these people and a desperate need to withhold himself from them. \"He found the waiting for them, the sense of expectation before a visit, the most blissful time of all,\" T\u00f3ib\u00edn writes. \"He also relished the days after the guest had departed, he enjoyed the peace of the house, as though the visit had been nothing except a battle for solitude which he had finally won.\"What's most touching, even heart-wrenching, is the way those closest to James accommodate his detachment as the price of his friendship. He and the novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson, for instance, enjoy a passionate meeting of minds in Italy. But as she sinks deeper into depression, she never dares to ask outright for his help, and he never stoops to answer her veiled cries. In every case, the people who desperately need him allow him to perpetuate the illusion that they're as self-sufficient as he is.Only as the casualties mount and a few friends have the nerve to confront him with his own ruthlessness is he willing to consider the fear of entanglement that cauterizes his affections.T\u00f3ib\u00edn's work displays the kind of depth and sensitivity that few authors can offer - or demand. After all, writing a novel that captures Henry James is like deriving an equation that calculates Albert Einstein. It's an audacious attempt that manages to beat the master at his own game, while avoiding the perils of parody or sycophancy. The result is a beautiful, haunting portrayal that measures the amplitude of silence and the trajectory of a glance in the life of one of the world's most astute social observers.http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0525/p1..."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "It's pretty audacious to make Henry James the hero of your book.

My gratitude is enhanced by its unpredictability: Henry James has never become very readable for me, as I tried to do when I was very young. Now I see that I had been misled by a teacher who had too small a concept of the age and patience reading James requires. So I had led myself to open The Ambassadors, never quite figuring out a word of it, thinking at times it had been written through thick gauze and then translated from some other language.As a result, James has always stood as the embodiment of high sensibility, a lofty poshness of bloodless prose, hardly an American writer at all. Not Dreiser or Howells, certainly not Whitman, not Emerson. Not that kind of mastery or sensuality. How my affection for a novel about Henry James has occurred is a mystery. A mystery: I think that is the purpose reading, to find a mystery at its heart. Any reading, newspaper, diary, garden book. Why does this happen? What must happen next? How does this engender thought? What are these unprecedented thoughts?The Master was an experience of slow, interrupted reading, always in the background as I struggled to write a long chapter about the aesthetics of fiction, and how that art works within us as we read and live it. Toward the end, the essay uses the words of Mark Edmundson. \"\u201cThe test of a book lies in its power to map or transform a life. The question we would ultimately ask of any work of art is this: Can you live it?\u201d (Why Read?, p. 129) I lived this book and experienced the qualities of light in its English and Italian rooms. I noted its extraordinary feelings: the interior longing for confidence in love; the complexity and doubt of human relationships, doubling and folding over with age and memory; and the immeasurable distances between persons seated in the same room, gazing at the same sculpture, or grieving the same loss. Reading slowly, I lived Henry's thinking, lived at Henry's pace.The novel begins in 1895 and ends in 1899, just as the year turns into a new age. Henry, born in 1843, will die in 1916, outliving his siblings. William James and his wife Alice are strongly present in the final chapter; their parents, sister Alice and two brothers are present in flashbacks as well. (The mother sends a message from the grave, in fact.) This period includes a catastrophic writing failure; finding a home away from London; a retrospective view of the Civil War, inspired by a visit from Oliver Wendell Holmes; travel to Italy; surviving the loss of a beloved woman; a passionate but unconsummated friendship with a young sculptor; a family reconciliation with a view toward death. A book, therefore, about loneliness and silence; about exile and about being American; about a complicated family of genius; about responsibility and guilt; about creating a place for oneself; about sleeping alone for a long lifetime.At the end of the book, speaking about writing with the visiting Edmund Gosse (who is about to write about his own conflicted life in Father and Son) Henry is asked to tell \"the moral\" of planned stories he has begun to write. One story is about a man who anticipates something dreadful for all his life, not seeing until it is too late that \"his own coldness\" is the catastrophe. Another is about an intelligent man with a suppressed \"sensuous nature.\" Toibin writes, \"'The Moral?' Henry thought for a moment. 'The moral is the most pragmatic we can imagine, that life is a mystery and that only sentences are beautiful, and that we must be ready for change ...\" The moment is celebratory and light, in fact, but it closes with these truths: Henry embodies human resonance in all its unclarity, and sentences are beautiful.Toibin is himself a master of the telling, knifepoint sentence. In a recent interview he says he once told a class, \u201cYou have to be a terrible monster to write.\" That is, you must be willing to cut out and thieve the intimacies of others for your fiction and coldly put them on display. And yet here, Henry James has had five years of his life, and all the ruminations in it, stolen for these pages in a way that softens his monstrosity for me, and elevates the writer's heartlessness to a form of exquisite art. It helps me to revise my thinking, and to understand the irony that the failed writer fails because he has not been heartless enough.This is a book that I will not recommend because my joy as its reader cannot be trusted or assumed to transfer, though I think it is a rare and unpredictably moving masterpiece. I am now a decade older than Henry James was in 1899 and I too am far from where I started. I understand his distances from others; his disappointments with himself; the definitive Jamesian quality of restraint and longing; the desire and captivity of words. But I can just barely imagine the density of the tapestries of James's perceptions, their great weight; the continuities traced among lives and settings; nor can I fully grasp the rooms, the images in those mindful tapestries. However, I think with great admiration that they have been beautifully taken from the master and threaded here by Toibin's hand."}, {"userName": "Pechi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41578933-pechi", "userReview": "While most biographies deal with the external lives of their heroes recording the pivotal moments in their histories and their material accomplishments, The Master unwaveringly charts the inner life of Henry James - his emotional topography and vivid introspections - with stunning clarity that leaves you feeling dangerously intimate to him, as if he were your favorite sibling. The restrained prose could be compared to a deadly calm lake at night - steady without any ripples, beautiful and reflecting moonlight - breathtakingly eloquent. Though Henry James is a legend, Toibin must have faced enormous difficulty in novelizing this extremely dull writer's life. Surprisingly, the book is extremely engaging and that alone is a testament of Toibin's raconteuring prowess. Henry James as a person is not very likeable - he is selfish, tedious, at times hypocritical and to top it all - he loathes Oscar Wilde. But, The Master manages to deliver a very favorable impression of this novelist who seems to have been as tedious as his sentences. And that's its feat. A satisfying read even if you were wondering whether Henry James is a renaissance painter or a Russian dictator. Novelization has its perks, indeed!P.S: Beware, if you haven't read any of Henry James' works. You'll have to dodge quite a lot of spoilers like I did."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126644-jeff", "userReview": "it's been a couple weeks since i finished _the master_, so i approach this review with both the benefit of critical distance and the burden of a poor memory for detail.ostensibly a fictional account of the life and inner mental workings of henry james, _the master_ ironically succeeds in painting nuanced portraits of james's cohorts while treating james himself as little more than a caricature-montage of social withdrawal, repressed homosexuality and inadvertant emotional carelessness. While one may argue that because james's contemporaries are presented through his own intellectual prism (the book is written in third person free indirect discourse) we can infer his mental disposition through those portraits, the reader is ultimately left with a confusing authorial dynamic that in bizarre ways pits toibin against james; in point of fact, we simply can't know whether the depictions of minny temple, constance fenimore woolston, et al, are toibin's own or ones that can be safely ascribed to james the historical personage. maybe it doesn't really matter._the master_ also flaunts its exhaustive research on the events of james's life without seeming to realize that the historical accuracy of where he lived in which years and with whom he dined can be of no import to most readers (save the odd 19th century lit professor here and there). while i applaud toibin for the homework, _the master_ grafts historical occurrences onto an otherwise interesting story with excessive fervor.similary, toibin draws correlations between james's historical circumstances and his novels with a bit too much ease. in many cases, an interaction here or there gives rise to an immediate emotional epiphany and, in turn, a major james novel. i admire the attempt to assimilate james's life with his art, but i find it hard to believe that something minor happens and, bang, he churns out _portrait of a lady_. there can be no question that toibin's prose is fluid and engaging, if a bit precious, and i found the descriptions of american life abroad among the educated rich at the turn of the 20th century extremely compelling, but in the end i expected more from a book recommended by the inimitable andrea lynch (as well as the booker prize committee), both of whose taste is generally flawless."}, {"userName": "Paola", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8934711-paola", "userReview": "This is my first Colm Toibin, and it definitely won\u2019t be the last - he writes so beautifully, it is a joy to read, and this alone would earn top marks for me. But I did find the subject matter disorienting. I did not do any research before starting this novel, and so I can only presume that a lot of what the Henry James does and writes is based on Toibin\u2019s own research, perusal of correspondence, and so on. But what about what Henry James thinks? How he feels? Hammond\u2019s hand on his shoulder, the meaningful silences peppering most conversations, the dress that wouldn\u2019t sink in Venice lagoon: these are the culprits in Toibin\u2019s 'Henry James whodunnit\u2019, these are the details and nuances that answer who James really was. There must be much of Toibin\u2019s himself in this: does he also borrow heavily from those around him to create his story? Does he also savour the peace of the morning, does he long for work, or is he overcome by darkness at the end of a novel like Constance? The mix of fiction and fact, a writer interpreting another writer did disorient me, and at times I lost touch with the novel itself, as when watching a movie or play in which the identity of the famous superstar actor does not allow you to suspend belief and fall into the plot.Just one caveat: after finishing the book, I have read several reviews, most of which put homosexuality (mostly James\u2019 undeclared one) centre stage, often relating it to that of Toibin\u2019s himself - this seem to occupy a disproportionate share of the reviews. Of course sexuality is part of being human, and Toibin depicts James\u2019 sexuality as complex as anyone\u2019s - but that is about it, and turning this as the main theme of the book is to me thoroughly unfair, detracting from the many layers of this beautiful book.

James was born of a wealthy Boston family, but lived much of his life in Europe. Throughout this book, James struggles in his relationships with both family and friends. He never completely loses his aloof standoffish behavior as well as the book hints of a struggle accepting or exploring his sexuality. I have to say that I really struggled with this book. As I read over other people's reviews and I kept thinking - Is that the same book? Maybe it is because I've only read 1 short story by Henry James - The Turn of the Screw. As the novel covered how James came up with his ideas for the characters and plot of this ghost story, I did find that interesting. But I kept on hoping for a breakthrough in his own personal life. Either by developing a long lasting friendship, or at least acceptance/contentment with his life. Maybe my dissatisfaction was due to the audio production - the narrator, Ralph Cosham was flat and morose (which seemed to match James' life...).

One does not need to be a fan of Henry James or to even have read his work to enjoy this portrait- the novel is beautifully rendered, intense and fascinating.

I have a vague memory of at least attempting it. But otherwise, I have never had the courage to try Henry James; his reputation of writing complex sentences that go on for pages have frightened me away. Having now read The Master, I am much more curious about James\u2019 work. Toibin makes a few suggestions as to who in Henry James\u2019 circle of friends inspired certain stories or characters (though be warned, the end of Portrait of a Lady is spoiled in these pages). The Master is the portrait of the artist as a man who was desperately lonely yet also purposefully alone, \u201cRemaining invisible, becoming skilled in the art of self-effacement, even to someone whom he had known so long, gave him satisfaction.\u201d Toibin suggests that at least in part, James held himself aloof so as to better observe and gather material for his novels but perhaps mostly because he feared intimacy. There is one section near the end that was funny when William James accuses his brother of writing novels that no one will read in the future\u2026Who knows if that was William\u2019s true opinion or not but The Master is littered with other true-to-life American novelists and writers whose works have not withstood the test of time. I found this book, which only covers only about a year of Henry James\u2019 life, with flashbacks to his past, strangely mesmerizing. The chapters are very long and they start in one place then digress but always come back to the original subject. I don\u2019t know if this is an imitation of James\u2019 writing style or not. Maybe. I know that Michael Cunningham did this with The Hours and I hated it. I can read Woolf directly; I don\u2019t need to read an imitation of her. So perhaps it is a good thing that I haven\u2019t tried James\u2019 works yet."}, {"userName": "C.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1425694-c", "userReview": "Margaret Drabble, Tracy Chevalier, Sarah Dunnant et al., please take note: this is good historical fiction.Although it was unclear to me at first the extent to which Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's beautiful book The Master is historical fiction and to what extent it is biography. Whatever it is, I absolutely adore it.I don't know much about Henry James (in fact, I'm somewhat ashamed to say I've never read any of his books - I'll get to it eventually I promise), but from reading some reviews, I get the impression that The Master is a whole lot of speculation based around a framework of real events. This doesn't actually bother me at all. I am fast coming to realise that characterisation may well be my favourite thing about literature, and I know from experience that filling in the gaps of what you don't know about a character in a way that may not be strictly true but is true to the personality of the character as you know them is one of the single most enjoyable and satisfying things you can do.In relation to this, I'd like to quote this review from The Guardian: \"How the books grow out of the life is the novel's deepest story. The phrase \"I can imagine\" crops up several times in the imaginary conversations. It irritated me, as it seemed so anomalous - but it's a clue to what T\u00f3ib\u00edn is doing. He shows us James's capacity for imagining his way in minute detail into, say, the state of mind of an abandoned child, his superhuman attention to \"figures seen from a window or a doorway, a small gesture standing for a much larger relationship, something hidden suddenly revealed\". T\u00f3ib\u00edn too \"can imagine\" his way into Henry James with exceptional attention - and, particularly, into the process of turning his own \"personal store\" of memories and relationships into fiction. Sometimes he allows himself simplistic biographical links, but at its best, the novel deals carefully and subtly with the complicated, mysterious process of how a novelist - above all, this master-novelist - goes about 'masking and unmasking himself'.\"It is such a clear, if often unflattering, portrait of James that I feel like I know this man I had barely heard of before. He is gorgeously flawed. He is idealistic, selfish, snobbish, self-absorbed, self-justifying and so, so, so believable. I fell in love with his flaws again and again and again. It helps that he is also endlessly introspective. I adore introspection. I suspect I indulge in it far too often, but then perhaps so does T\u00f3ib\u00edn's James.I have only two possible criticisms of this book, and I say 'possible' because I'm not entirely convinced that they are bad things. The first is an occasional tendency to lapse into sentimentality. I hate sentimentality, so I suppose it's telling that it barely grated at all in this case. To me it seemed to be in character, and I barely noticed it except occasionally when it maybe got a tiny, tiny bit out of hand. So tiny I can't even think of an example, which is pretty pathetic on my part and says a lot for the inconsequentiality of this criticism.The second is that it is highly episodic. First he talks about the failure of James's play Guy Domville, but then he goes straight onto something else, I think it might have been James's relationship with his cousin Minny Temple. From there, on to something else. It frustrated me a bit. Some novel-reading part of me wanted it to have some common thread arching throughout. Although Guy Domville is portrayed as such a crucial event of James's life, it is only mentioned occasionally in the latter part (by which I mean almost all) of the book, and then only as a very, very marginal comment. I didn't sense that any of the episodes were more important or central than any others, though of course there are themes present throughout - the conflict between public and private life being an obvious one - but somehow I wanted at least one of the events to be more omnipresent.The reason I wonder if this is really a criticism is because once again, it is true to life. Life is episodic. We have our temporary preoccupations, our transient obsessions. Something that seems monumental at the time will have receded into the minutiae of the past after a few days - weeks - months - years. It is rare for one event to dictate the course of one's life, and for this I doubt my own assessment.I'd like to end on a quote from the book itself. ' \"I view the historical novel as tainted by a fatal cheapness and if you want a statement from me on the matter... it would be all one word.\" Henry said. \"One simple word. It would all be humbug!\" ' I too have felt this intrinsic 'cheapness' of the historical fiction genre, and it is so all-pervasive that I have come to equate the two. Perhaps this is unfair. No matter. Simply rest assured that there is nothing whatsoever that is 'cheap' or 'humbug' about The Master."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "My rating: 3.5 starsThis is the fictionalized story of Henry James life in the period of 1895 to 1899.The author describes his turbulent family life, including the suicide of his father, the tragic and early death of his sister Alice, his cousin Minny Temple who suffered from tuberculosis.Along the narrative, the author show the influence and/or friendship of some authors on Henry James during the referred period of time of this book: John Gray, Oscar Wilde among many others.His strong friendship with Constance Fenimore Woolson - the great-niece of James Fenimore Cooper - played an important role in James\u2019s females characters.His relationship with Hendrik Christian Andersen is also described in this book.Another interesting book on the same subject as Toibin\u2019s book is A Private Life Of Henry James - Two Women & His Art by Lyndall Gordon.4* Nora Webster3.5* The MasterTBR BrooklynTBR The Blackwater LightshipTBR The Testament of MaryTBR The Heather Blazing"}, {"userName": "Bandit", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit", "userReview": "I liked Brooklyn and wanted to read more of T\u00f3ib\u00edn's work. Maybe this wasn't the right choice, but all the praises and reviews and awards seem to suggest otherwise. Granted I'm not a fan of James, I have no formed opinion of James, having never read his work, though I saw the film adaptations and they never made me want to read James. Like some classic literature tends to, James' work seemed to be something of a ploddingly slow variety, although most likely well written. Appropriately enough just like The Master itself. As a historical fiction, it's an interesting read on the late 1800s. As a novel, it's positively soporific. James comes across as a fairly dispassionate observer of life, who travels through Europe witnessing more so than experiencing. Despite having written of complex human emotions and, of course, the chief one of them all...love, it doesn't appear as though James has actually engaged in any of it, aside from his unrealized homosexual longings. It isn't particularly engaging to read about an unengaged, emotionally aloof character, regardless of his place in the literary realm. T\u00f3ib\u00edn is unquestionably a very talented writer, he does some spectacular things with words. It just wasn't enough in this instance to entertain, delight or even sometimes keep awake. The completist in me stubbornly stuck around for the duration, but was glad to see it over.
