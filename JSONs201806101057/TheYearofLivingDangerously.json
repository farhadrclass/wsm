If you haven't seen the film, it's one of the best. The story of a rookie journalist caught up in the growing turmoil of Indonesia, followed by his wise but disgruntled cameraman (a dwarf named Billy Kwan), The Year of Living Dangerously is a book deep with history, friendship, romance and horrible frustration for a country on the brink of true horror. As unfortunately was the case, Indonesia was hit by a terrible genocide in the 1960's in real-life. This book doesn't really discuss that, but for any history buffs reading it, you'll have it in the back of your mind knowing all too well what's to come."}, {"userName": "Joe Valdez", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez", "userReview": "The Year of Living Dangerously, the 1978 novel by C.J. Koch, is a towering disappointment as reading material. I say that as someone who loves the 1982 film based on Koch's book--a classic, end-of-summer romance of tremendous passion and sophistication starring Mel Gibson, Sigoruney Weaver and in her Academy Award winning performance as a male Chinese-Australian dwarf, Linda Hunt--but who also has a particular distaste for passive narrators who observe characters through a telephoto lens. In Koch's book, the emotional stakes are distant, the passion and intensity fleeting and the information dumps sky high in what should have been a compelling narrative.The story is the first person account of Cook, an Australian reporter in his late thirties who bares an awful resemblance to Koch and conveniently observes all. In the summer of 1965, Cook is posted in the sweltering Indonesian capitol of Jakarta, where populist strongman Sukarno placates his impoverished people with threats against the West and promises a return to glory. At the Wayang Bar, an oasis for the foreign press corps inside the air conditioned Hotel Indonesia, a Chinese-Australian dwarf and freelance photographer named Billy Kwan introduces himself to Guy Hamilton, the newly arrived correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Service. Kwan recognizes in Hamilton dashing good looks and naked ambition, as well as the newsman's existential problem. The ABS correspondent Hamilton has been sent to replace left Indonesia without showing Hamilton the ropes or sharing what contacts he had. Kwan takes Hamilton outside the hotel compound for a stroll through the slums, exposing him to the poverty and degradation of the people, voicing support for the overtures Sukarno is making to improve their living conditions. The next morning, Kwan proposes a partnership--Hamilton for the words, Billy for the pictures--and offers to help him build contacts in both Sukarno's government and in the Communist insurgency, the PKI. Hamilton ashed his cigar, and studied the end of it for some moments without speaking. He began now to entertain a suspicion which was to be the subject of a number of discussions in the Wayang Bar: that Kwan was involved with the PKI, and was perhaps a Communist Party member. This might cause trouble in the future; but he decided not to question his good luck.\"If this works out,\" he said finally, \"I'll make a deal with you. I'll give you all the film you can handle from now on; I'll use no one else, and you won't need to scratch for work again. There's just one condition. You check in with me every day before you take any other assignments--and if you have any more contacts like this, you give them to me. Okay?\"Kwan blinked twice, then broke into a broad grin. \"Fine,\" he said. \"That's what I've always wanted--a real partnership. You're a hard bugger, but I think you and I will get on, Guy.\" He jerked in his chair. \"You'll get an interview that'll make an international stir. It'll get things rattling on the diplomatic circuit here, I can tell you. An interview like this needs a good instrument to transmit it.\" His chin lifted, and his face wore a new expression: one of almost fatuous pride. \"I've chosen a good instrument,\" he said.At the pool behind the hotel, Kwan introduces Hamilton to Jill Bryant, a secretary at the British Embassy who works for Col. Ralph Henderson, British Military Attache. One of the few single white women in Jakarta, Jill is heavily pursued but wary of involvement with another man after her affair with a French diplomat ended badly. Her friendship with Billy serves to keep suitors away, but having met with the cameraman's approval, Hamilton gets the impression that Billy is conspiring to get him together with Jill. He wins points with Billy by deliberately losing a swimming race against the Colonel when he sees how bad the elder Brit wants to win.The top foreign newsmen--a British fop named Wally O'Sullivan and a crass Canadian correspondent named Pete Curtis--have to concede that Hamilton has usurped them with his scoops. While Curtis makes no secret of his taste for the Javanese prostitutes who sell themselves outside the cemetery after dark, Cook carries the secret of Wally's sex life: a proclivity for young men. Cook's confidence with Hamilton reveals no sexual perversions, only a blind pursuit for something big on the horizon. Hamilton is assisted in his work by an Indonesian named Kumar who the newsman is generous toward and respectful of, but begins to suspect is affiliated with the PKI.Once Hamilton and Jill become lovers--with Billy's blessing and even encouragement to use his garden bungalow for privacy, which Guy is given a key to--the photographer's behavior grows erratic. Jakarta is edging closer to civil war. Jill dispels Hamilton's suspicion of her long hours working with the Colonel by revealing that the Chinese have floated an arms shipment to the PKI. Hamilton refuses to promise he won't use this bombshell in his reports, estranging himself both from his lover and from his partner. Billy grows increasingly disillusioned with President Sukarno as well and begins to assume all the characteristics of an assassin.Having gone to earth, Billy Kwan preoccupied us in the Wayang more than he had done when he was visible. Perhaps it was a symptom of our own general exhaustion and malaise. Even Henri Bouchard and Kevin Condon discussed him to an extent they would not normally have done. Wally's expulsion, and Kwan's suspected part in it, made some post-mortems inevitable, but they continued to a morbid extent: we were like voyagers on a cruise that had gone on too long. And outrage became replaced by a black amusement.The Year of Living Dangerously has some vivid writing in it. Its strength is the eloquence in which Koch describes the atmosphere of Jakarta and how it serves as a pressure cooker for his characters. Koch, a radio producer for the Australian Broadcasting Service in Sydney for many years before he became a full-time writer, based much of Guy Hamilton on his younger brother Philip, who covered Sukarno's downfall and signed his broadcasts off in much the same manner as Hamilton does. Hamilton, a prince, and Billy, a dwarf who serves the prince, would appear to have a dynamic relationship, juxtaposed nicely against the lore of the wayang kulit, the Indonesian shadow puppet theater..The critical flaw in the novel is the use of the author surrogate \"Cook\" to tell the reader everything. We are told about Sukarno. We are told about Javanese culture. We are told what Jill Bryant looks like, exhaustively. We are told what characters are thinking and what they uttered in private conversations with each other, even though \"Cook\" would have no insight into most of these details. Some of his information is vital to the story but very little of it revealed through the actions of the characters, which are Hamilton and Billy. Guy & Jill's romance is largely absentee here, communicated to the reader with all the excitement of a letter a mother might write you while you were at summer camp.The novel goes off the rails when Koch drops Billy from the story and follows Hamilton on holiday to Tugu, where Kumar arranges a rendezvous with a Russian spy who wants the itinerary of the Chinese arms shipment and is prepared to seduce Guy to get it. This transaction was dropped from the Australian-American production directed by Peter Weir and adapted by C.J. Koch and Peter Weir & David Williamson, which focuses on \"A Love Caught In The Fire Of Revolution.\" Hunt's award-winning performance as Billy Kwan gives the character a gentle nature not evident in the book, where Billy is often depicted as an exotic creep a la Peter Lorre."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "[cheating (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "I may be one of the few people who never saw the movie but I really enjoyed the book!

It's disgusting. It makes Indonesians and Sukarno seem like mindless idiots, like they have no political acumen, and what is to be expected when it is written by a white man? White people hate it when we refuse to allow them to exploit and rule us anymore and so this shit is what we get. White people giving this book a good review, you're all fucking racists.

Your internalized racism makes you even more disgusting than the White man cos it's your own people you're selling out. If I could give this book a negative star I would. This book is only for the Asians who like to put down other Asians to get the White mans approval, and the Whites yearning for the good old days where they were rich and could do as they please and think they are somehow better than the rest of us mindless savages.

I watched the movie (probably half a dozen times) before I ever read the book years ago. I'm not sure what compelled me to pick it up again, but I'm so glad I did. While I love the movie for its atmosphere, I love the book for its insights into the politics of Indonesia in the early 1960s. That time period was so politically volatile, and it was completely overshadowed by the rapidly growing war in Vietnam. This book also helps the reader understand the Western mind set that led to the Vietnam War. The story of the complicated friendship between an Australian journalist and a Chinese-Australian photographer (I'm over-simplifying, but I don't want to give anything away) as Indonesia perches on the verge of a bloody civil war, this book is appealing for its variety of characters --- each a type (though not a stereotype) of person who finds himself far from where he is from, torn between cultures, unsure of where to call home after so many years adrift in foreign lands. I'm also impressed with the way Koch weaves spirituality with politics, tradition with progress, and the conflicts of loyalties to one's nation and loyalties to one's self."}, {"userName": "CD ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1455178-cd", "userReview": "Thirty years after I first read this, Koch's writing still evokes the same sensations and feeling it did originally. It is if I had only read it yesterday. The now long gone era of post colonialist fervor of Indonesia in the pre Suharto days of the Bung Karno (Sukarno's mad regime) is brought to life if only in the dreams of the characters and shadows of wayang kulit puppets to the sound of the gamelan music.While the style of writing may be different than current fashion dictates, it is not dated and perhaps borders on ethereal overlaid by a first person perfect journalistic commentary.The Year of Living Dangerously is the god-king Sukarno terminology for a stage of behavior of 'his' people to employ in their struggle with the rest of the world during 1965. Confrontation and other mad, as insane, phrases and reinvented words are bandied about in the politics of Indonesia in this moment in a revolutionary time. A small group of western journalists are on hand to watch and report the deterioration of society. The group includes an Australian half Chinese dwarf photo journalist whose intellectual fervor takes him along for the ride in to the depths of the beast of the fervor gripping the populace. The main protagonist, Guy Hamilton, another Aussie journalist becomes the victim of the many behind the scenes intrigues culminating in a final physical confrontation and punishment that foreshadowing hints at for a third or more of the book. If not morally deserving of the injury coming to him, he at the least, is another not innocent scapegoat. Contradictions abound in this world of unending darkness.Set in the cultural and climatic density that is South Eastern Asia, The Year of Living Dangerously hints and overly rails at many virulent topics from racism, to poverty, to tyranny, to the cultural morass and depravity left from colonial times as the people afflicted choose a new social model. Blood, death, and chaos are never far behind the dancing shadow tales of a people entering into this world of Dangerous Living.It is all Water from the Moon"}, {"userName": "David Winger", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9925735-david-winger", "userReview": "Reading Patrick Holland's new novel got me thinking about Australian authors covering S E Asia and digging through my library for a book I almost forgot I had, and I started re-reading it.

Picked up a third hand copy of the book, probably in Bras Basah road in Singapore way back, but it's sat on my TBR shelf for far too long.

This is an atmospheric political thriller that captures the last months of Sukarno's presidency as seen through the eyes of a group of - mainly Australian - journalists. It centres on Guy Hamilton, who is befriended by the dwarf photographer, Billy Kwan, soon after his arrival in Jakarta.

Sebelumnya sangat jarang, hanya bisa dihitung dengan jari, sebuah roman yang menggambarkan masa-masa pemberontakan G 30 S/PKI tanpa adanya sponsor dari pemerintah. Untuk itu, novel ini terhitung berharga untuk bangsa Indonesia.Indonesia disini dipandang dari kacamata orang asing. Pada masa itu, Indonesia sangat membenci orang asing dengan propaganda Soekarno yang anti Nekolim. Indonesia pada masa pemerintahan Soekarno pernah begitu tegas terhadap dunia. Malaysia diganyang. Amerika dan Inggris \"Go to hell!\". Keluar dari PBB. Peduli amat dengan blok barat dan timur, Soekarno membuat NEFO (New Emerging Forces).Soekarno, telah diakui oleh siapapun, selalu membuat decak kagum, bahkan oleh musuh-musuhnya. Dia orator yang sangat ulung dan logis, yang membuat orang-orang tergerak hanya dengan mendengarkannya. Dia punya mimpi besar untuk Indonesia, untuk dunia. Namun seperti anak yang terlalu asyik bermain dengan mainannya, dia lupa menapak ke realitas. Realitasnya adalah rakyatnya miskin dan kekurangan makanan.Soekarno, di mata orang yang tak pernah bisa memahaminya secara menyeluruh, adalah tiran dan pahlawan. Bahkan orang yang menganggap dia tiran pun mengakui bahwa Soekarno adalah pahlawan terbesar Indonesia. Soekarno selalu menarik untuk diperbincangkan, tak ada habis-habisnya membicarakan Soekarno. Bagaimana kecerdasannya yang melebihi rata-rata. Bagaimana percaya dirinya yang luar biasa. Bagaimana dia benar-benar di dalam hati mencintai petani (seperti Marhen) dan tukang becak. Bagaimana serunya petualangan seksualnya. Bagaimana dia berusaha membangun monumen-monumen untuk menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia adalah Superpower. Monumen Nasional konon dibangun menunjukkan mitos alat kelaminnya berujung emas. Orang membenci sekaligus mencintainya setengah mati. Seperti jatuh cinta, kita jatuh cinta kepada Soekarno, tapi kemudian frustrasi oleh cinta itu sendiri. Seperti Billy Kwan dalam buku ini, yang obsesif terhadap Soekarno.Buku ini benar-benar bukan novel biasa. Sangat kompleks sebagai thriller psikologis. Sangat detail sebagai roman sejarah. Sangat mencekam sebagai sebuah drama. Sebuah buku yang lengkap, Anda tak akan menyesal membacanya. Ini adalah buku yang penting untuk Indonesia.Dari orang asing, kita mendapatkan gambaran mengenai sejarah negeri kita. Dari orang asing, kita mengenal stereotip bangsa kita, orang-orang berkulit coklat, dengan etika kerja yang terganggu oleh cuaca yang begitu panas, selalu merokok kretek yang baunya membuat mual, dan menggemari sate.Ya itulah kita, bangsa Indonesia.

It was the perfect read while I covered some ground there, as measly as my trip was, I think the book took me even further than my legs could. On the surface, The Year of Living Dangerously is light, even ridiculous at times. There is a scene where our protagonist Guy Hamilton is being pursued for friendship by Billy Kwan the dwarf cameraman, and goddamn if I didn't think the whole time that no one asks you to be friends anymore. Not even in the 50s, I don't believe they do. But crazy and off-kilter as it was, there was always an intensity to the story, and I valued that greatly especially in Billy Kwan. Billy Kwan, who I regarded more as the protagonist rather than Guy Hamilton, was a severely under-appreciated character. As I read, Billy becomes more and more compelling. He was a creature of passion, he had heroes, he pinned his hopes on them and gave them everything he had in order to see a mutual dream realized. We know from the start that his heroes would betray him. Still, even with Billy's idealistic and almost childish point of view, he does so with utmost sincerity, and it is difficult to fault him for his beliefs. The only problem is his tendency to manipulate, coming as close to playing God, just because he had beliefs. The Year of Living Dangerously was exhilarating and disturbing, the perfect match for all the dualities in the book. P/S: There is a movie version of this, while casting is perfect (guess who plays Billy Kwan, go on Google it!) the story itself was tweaked in ways I didn't like.

Something about a larger number of days, months, and years gives us perspective. But some decades become lost. In the twentieth century, that is true, I think, for the 1920s and 1970s (and it may become true for the 1990s). The preceding and following decades tended to nibble into both the 1920s and 1970s. Like the 1920s and the aftermath of World War I, the first few years of the 1970s dealt with a lingering war, Vietnam, that had impacted not just the United States and Southeast Asia but the world at large. And like the 1920s again, with the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929, the last year of the 1970s slipped back into a renewal of the Cold War leading to the ultimate demise of Communism in Eastern Europe and Russia. The 1970s, it seems actually existed for but a small span of time, for three or four years from 1975 to 1979. And right in the middle of them appeared Christopher J. Koch's novel, The Year of Living Dangerously.Koch seems to realize he has managed to place his narrative in a unique time. Part of that is brought about through the skillful use of a narrator, \"Cookie\" (Koch himself). Why skillful? Because the setting of the story is 1965 Indonesia, during the last year of Sukarno's dictatorship. To tell it solely from that viewpoint would have made it too immediate. And the story needs distance. After all, it is told in a semi-nostalgic tone, which is also loaded with the wisdom of age and its accompanying skepticism rather than youthful disillusionment and cynicism. The 13 year gap provides that, as does shifting the point of view of the story from Guy Hamilton, the Australian journalist at the middle of it all, to Hamilton's friend and confidante, Cookie. It is all of a time with its particular era, because the late 1970s, or the \"true 1970s,\" themselves reflected that same exhaustion and skepticism towards anything other than the personal in life.That is the real story of The Year of Living Dangerously, the exit of the West from Asia, the knowledge that especially Southeast Asia would always have an unknowable quality that Westerners could never understand. Ever. Hamilton depicts that perfectly. His still lingering schoolboy character is built on the echoes of empire and Kipling. His desire to escape the humdrum existence of suburban Australia reflected in his reading of W. Somerset Maugham. And his thirst for adventure and danger in the novels of Ian Fleming's James Bond. These are the books that dominate his bookshelves. And probably the James Bond movies should be included, too. After all, when Hamilton is menacingly held underwater at a mountain top resort pool by a Russian agent, Vera, it is awfully reminiscent of Bambi and Thumper's attack on Sean Connery in Diamonds Are Forever, which, by the way, just happened to be directed by Guy Hamilton.At book's end, Koch's Guy Hamilton is ejected from Asia altogether. Left physically scared, he holds Asia as his true \"home.\" But it can't be. As is also made clear towards the end, Hamilton belongs to a tradition rooted in the Aegean and flourishing in even further northern climes. Yes, there is clearly something of the dark and light of the Indonesian shadow puppet show in the clash between the two cultures. A hope for a merging of the Christian and the socialist, the Hindu and the Muslim, and perhaps East with West, as Hamilton's own puppet master, the dwarf, Billy Kwan, held out for. But that is a hope. I think it was Koch's hope. I am not sure, however, that his character, Hamilton, could ever really achieve that home any more than the rest of us Westerners living in Southeast Asia."}, {"userName": "Norton Stone", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13052425-norton-stone", "userReview": "This is a 'Classic', a must read for anyone interested in the craft of writing. Multi layered, written with the precision of a professional writer and the heart of a man who truly understands human failing. The second person telling of Cookie was initially difficult to come to terms with and it is only beyond the middle of the book that it becomes clear how he is able to recount the lives of the main protagonists around him with such detail. Cookie is, the most one-dimensional character in the book and plays a voyeurs role, never taking part in any action. If there is a fault in the structure of the book, and I would expect to be challenged on this, it is Cookie's ability to reconstruct events, not only from Billy Kwan's dossiers, but the conversations with Hamilton that occur beyond the events unfolding in the last days of the Indonesian, Sukarno's regime. It is written so intimately I wonder whether the author contemplated an easier journey committing to the third person, given Cookie has no relevance to the story? The character of Wally O'Sullivan, a respected journalist, is handled with sympathy, yet by today's standards it is an indictment on those around him, including the main character Hamilton, that he is allowed to indulge his weakness without criticism. Ultimately the event that sets in train the conclusion leading to Billy Kwan's demise is Kwan whistleblowing on Wally. The establishment blackballs the self righteous but utterly correct Kwan, in favour of their favourite son.It is almost certainly how such things would have been handled in those days so one cannot criticise the author. That said there is a lot more to Billy Kwan and his spiritual almost symbiotic relationship with Hamilton and Sukarno. Through both men the dwarf is able to channel his intelligence through Hamilton as his local guide, and Sukarno, his personal faith. Unfortunately he is unable to guide Hamilton completely, and Sukarno's powers are failing.Without his 'hosts' Kwan is ultimately lost, he has no way of defining himself. This is a sad story in many ways and uniquely told, but better it is original and has real depth."}, {"userName": "Hari Brandl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10806871-hari-brandl", "userReview": "I'm so lucky to have found this book. I saw the movie long ago but didn't realize it was based on a book. The movie is quite different, as I remember.The writing is very good, and really propels the story along rather than merely moving it. Of course, the events in the background, having to do with the fall of the Sukarno regime, bring me back to thattime, and all that was the 60's. The device of having the story unfold through the eyes of an ill- defined narrator is very effective: it lends the reader a sense of detachment which is pleasant and takes the edge off the depictions of the misery of the Javanese while allowing the different dramas and intrigues of the journalists to play out. Every character is crisp and so many points of view are available to the reader.No less enjoyable is the parallel throughout of the Wayang, those exotic, shadowy puppet plays of Indonesia. In a very real way, all the characters were puppets of the political milieu, and of history. One other enjoyable aspect of the story-telling in this book is Mr Koch's deft bringing the Java of that time into focus. I could almost here the sounds, smell the different oders in the streets, and feel the oppressive heat.Mr Koch has become a new favorite author of mine."}, {"userName": "Patrick McCoy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/678506-patrick-mccoy", "userReview": "While getting myself in the mood for another visit to Indonesia, this time Lombok and Jakarta I re-watched Peter Weir's excellent adaptation of Christopher J. Koch's original novel, The Year Of Living Dangerously (1978). I guess it would be cliche to say that the novel was better than the film, but it something of a different animal-both are worthwhile-the film has a standout performance by Linda Hunt as the Aussie-Chinese half dwarf cameraman as well as early performances from breakout stars Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver. One feature from the novel that was taken out was the fact that it was narrated from the first person point of view from Cook, an Australian reporter in his late thirties who was sympathetic to all the main parties involved. I appreciated the authenticity of locations, historical events, local color, and more nuanced characterizations of the people involved in the story. It was better than I expected it to be and had lots of local color-too bad it arrived after I returned from my trip I should have liked to have read it in a seedy cafe in Jakarta."}, {"userName": "Robert Carlile", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32702251-robert-carlile", "userReview": "This is a fascinating tale of Jakarta during the final year 1965 of the presidency of Sukarno. This is a character driven novel, with the central characters of Billy Kwan and Guy Hamilton drawn in sharp relief against the poverty and suffering of the people under Sukarno's rule. Hamilton is a foreign correspondent in Jakarta and Billy is a photographer, but also a dwarf. The dialog and plot are authentic and will draw pictures in your mind that won't let go. I consider Billy Kwan to be one of the most indelible characters of all fiction, and I applaud Koch for that. My biggest criticism is the wordyness of the descriptions between scenes. The story is told from the POV an observer, Cookie, a minor character, looking down on the scenes. When the reader up close to Billy and Guy talking to each other, the reader is gripped in their interaction. The novel was made into a movie with Mel Gibson playing Hamilton with a woman, Lina Hunt, playing the dwarf, Billy Kwan."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52478035-sam", "userReview": "I tried to read this book years ago and got lost in the details of Jakarta in 1965. Age and some experience of living in Indonesia have given me a better appreciation of the observations and the historical aspect. Well written and a good story, although it went on a bit in parts. As always I was reaching for my red pen about two thirds of the way through...The story (and the title) are familiar to many Australians who lived through the 80's, but I did not expect it to be so nuanced, or to become so invested in the characters, or in the whole theatre of political intrigue and manoeuvring.Everything changes yet so much remains the same."}, {"userName": "Ann Van Hine", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9395461-ann-van-hine", "userReview": "Interesting fact I learned about book Koch also wrote screenplay of film that isn't the norm.

Setiap pagi sebelum berangkat kerja biasanya aku memandangi rak buku kira-kira buku mana yang akan menemani perjalanan ke kantor. Beruntung,buku ini kembali terpilih untuk dibaca. Momennya juga pas dengan peringatan 30 September 1965 dan aksi protes \u2018Ganyang Malaysia\u2019 yang kembali populer akhir-akhir ini.Guy Hamilton, wartawan Australia ditempatkan di Jakarta pada masa-masa \u2018 vivere pericoloso\u2019,yang merujuk kepada pidato Presiden Soekarno. Dia bergabung dengan wartawan-wartawan asing lainnya di klub wayang di Hotel Indonesia. Seorang juru foto bernama Billy Kwan menemaninya bertugas. Billy merupakan blasteran cina - australia. Secara penampilan fisik kedua rekan kerja ini seperti raksasa dan kurcacinya. Hamilton tinggi besar dan Billy pendek. Walaupun sering diledek dengan anggota klub wayang lainnya, Hamilton tidak ambil pusing.Wartawan sebelum Hamilton tidak meninggalkan informasi apa-apa mengenai kontak-kontak di pemerintahan. Atas jasa Billy lah yang membuka jalan buat Hamilton, Ia mewawancarai D.N. Aidit. Wawancara yang eklusif karena sebelumnya Aidit tidak pernah berbicara kepada wartawan barat. Di kesempatan tersebut Aidit menegaskan perlunya angkatan kelima yaitu petani yang dipersenjatai. Indonesia yang menganut politik bebas aktif pada masa itu sedang condong ke pihak Rusia-Cina. Pengaruh dari partai komunis sedang berada di puncak dengan menjadi partai komunis ke-3 terbesar di dunia. Hal ini menjadi kekhawatiran dari bangsa-bangsa barat. Salah satu sumber rahasia menyebutkan kapal bantuan penuh senjata dikirimkan ke Indonesia untuk mempersenjatai angkatan kelima. Sementara hubungan dengan negara serumpun berada di ambang perang. Semboyan \u2018Ganyang Malaysia\u2019 dipekikkan namun tidak terlaksana.Bill mempertemukan Hamilton dengan Jill Bryant, staf dari kedubes Inggris. Bill mencintai Jill dan ia telah melamar wanita itu, tapi ditolak. Hubungan Hamilton dan Jill berkembang menjadi serius, keduanya jatuh cinta. Yang lebih menarik diperhatikan adalah Bill Kwan.Ia mempunyai arsip masing-masing temannya. Awalnya ia memuja Presiden Soekarno. Kegemarannya pergi ke pasar baru malam-malam berharap bertemu Bung Karno yang konon \u2018turun\u2019 ke khalayak ramai untuk lebih dekat dengan rakyatnya. Penantian Bill tersebut membawanya ke sosok Ibu yang memakai kebaya lusuh dan menggendong bayinya. Ia mengikutinya hingga ke gubuk-gubuk kumuh. Potret kehidupan rakyat miskin kota menyadarkan Billy bahwa idolanya Soekarno tidak memperhatikan kesejahteraan rakyatnya. Ia masih saja membangun monumen ini-itu padahal rakyatnya kelaparan. Salah satunya yang membuat aku bergidik yaitu didalam salah satu pidatonya Soekarno menyarankan tikus ke dalam menu makanan..hiiiiiii.. Di malam pertamanya di Indonesia, Hamilton mendapati secarik kertas yang memberitahunya asisten Indonesianya, Kumar, adalah agen komunis. Suatu kali, Hamilton diajak berlibur ke Tugu oleh Kumar. Tanpa disangka Kumar mengajak atase kebudayaan kedubes Rusia, Vera Chostiakov. Sosok misterius Kumar pelan-pelan terbuka, ia bisa berbahasa Rusia dan pernah kuliah di Universitas Leningrad. Billy marah terhadap Hamilton. Ia berpendapat Hamilton mengkhianati Jill dan Vera mendekatinya karena menginginkan informasi kedatangan kargo senjata-senjata itu.Pada peristiwa 30 September, Hamilton yang masih merisaukan hubungannya dengan Jill tidak menyadari keadaan telah berubah bagi Soekarno dan partai komunis. Dalam perjalanannya ke kantor Kolonel Henderson, atase militer kedubes Inggris, mencegatnya dan memberitahunya agar ke Istana Merdeka yang sudah dikelilingi tentara-tentara. Hamilton berharap dengan kartu pers dia bisa memasuki daerah Istana. Langkahnya dihalangi oleh tentara. Hamilton kurang bisa berbahasa Indonesia dan tentara tersebut tak mengerti bahasa Inggris. Popor senjata mengenai mata Hamilton. Beruntung,ia diselamatkan oleh kolonel Henderson ke kedubes Inggris.Buku ini sempat dilarang beredar di Indonesia oleh rezim orde baru. Diibaratkan adanya pertempuran wayang dari golongan kiri dan wayang golongan kanan. Wayang golongan kiri menghabisi jenderal-jenderal dari wayang golongan kanan. Yang dimenangkan oleh Mayjen Soeharto yang berasal dari wayang golongan kanan yang sebelumnya tidak diperhitungkan. Dan penggambaran peristiwa 30 September di buku ini tidak berbeda dengan propraganda orba. Jenderal-jenderal yang diculik, disiksa habis-habisan, matanya dicukil Gerwani dan dimutilasi. Aku jadi teringat film yang dulunya diputar setiap tanggal 30 September. Kontraversi dari pemberontakan 30 Sepetmber tersebut masih bergulir hingga hari ini. 45 tahun adalah waktu yang cukup lama dan kebenaran masih tersembunyi entah dimana.-1 Oktober 2010-"}], "description": "In 1965, Indonesia's fantastic beauty conceals a grim atmosphere of tension and unease. Sukrano, the charismatic god-king, placates his impoverished subjects with threats of war and gestures of magnificence, declaring his love for the suffering peasants, his defiance of the whole Western world. This new year, he insists, will be the climax of his reign, the year of confrontation--THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY.Meanwhile, in the sordid atmosphere of the Wayang Bar, beleagured Western newsmen take refuge from the seething streets of Jakarta and strike up unlikely friendships. Guy Hamilton, an ambitious Australian broadcaster, is thrown together with Billy Kwan, a brilliant and secretive Eurasian dwarf who is Guy's most effective cameraman. Hamilton is intrigued by Kwan, and is gradually drawn into the mysteries which enshroud Kwan's life. Why does Billy encourage Hamilton's affair with the English girl whom Kwan himself loves? And how genuine is Kwan's provocative admiration for President Sukarno?Characters and events in this masterful novel move against the background of a nation in crisis, in the exotic pattern of the wayang kulit, the Javanese shadow-show. Billy Kwan's secret life is revealed through his files--astounding dossiers where Kwan has recorded the activities of his friends and his own eccentric speculations.As violence engulfs the bankrupt government, Kwan builds impossible expectations around his two heroes: Sukarno will be the savior of his people; Hamilton will be the instrument of Kwan's fantasies. But when both heroes fail him, the tortured cameraman turns to desperate action, and Hamilton begins to grasp the pervasive mystery which had been at the core of his friend's ramblings all along.", "title": "The Year of Living Dangerously", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1503570.The_Year_of_Living_Dangerously", "average": 3.85, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1481334633l/1503570.jpg", "reviews": 126, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16175184.C_J_Koch", "name": "C.J.
