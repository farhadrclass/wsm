I have to say that this is his best novel to date. He keeps getting better and better. I absolutely loved THE HEIST!!! Daniel Silva is the best thriller writing alive today. His characters feel like they are part of my family. And the topics he chooses to move his stories forward not only entertain me, they educate me. He uses current events; hot topics in all his books. And his research is second to none! This latest page-turner even had me shedding a tear at the conclusion. I can hardly wait until next summer when I hope Gabriel Allon will return once again. Thanks, Daniel, for giving us this fabulous story."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "\"Why did you steal a Van Gogh and sell a copy to an Arab named Sam?\"\"Because I'm looking for a Caravaggio.\"\"For whom?\"\"The Italians.\"\"Why is an Isreali intelligence officer looking for a painting for the Italians?\"\"Because he finds it hard to tell people 'no.'\"So far the only major drawback of doing most of my reading via audiobooks is that I have no easy way of marking quotes to use later in my reviews, which is something I usually try to include. I listened to The Heist during my commute to work, and I want everyone to appreciate the fact that I had to rewind the above passage at least five times so I could write down the conversation on the notes app on my phone. The reason I went to so much trouble to write down this specific exchange was because it perfectly sets you up for this complex, convoluted plot, and there was no way I couldn't include it in the review. Having never read any of Daniel Silva's thrillers, I can't say if his other books require so many steps just to get to the main conflict. But holy shit, this one's a doozy. So the book starts with art dealer Julien Isherwood being called to a mansion on Lake Como, where he's supposed to pick up a painting for a colleague. Instead, he arrives to find the painting gone, and the owner of the house murdered. Isherwood calls in his friend Gabriel Allon, an art restorer and Isreali intelligence agent, to investigate the murder and clear his name. Allon soon discovers that the dead man was a former British spy who had been trading stolen artwork, and that one of those stolen pieces, now missing, is Caravaggio's famous lost Nativity painting. To recover the painting, Allon has to borrow a Van Gogh, make a forged copy, and trade that version for the Caravaggio. Oh, and the money trail for the stolen artwork leads to a bank in Germany that holds the fortune of a Middle Eastern dictator. Getting the Caravaggio back will require spying on, and stealing from, one of the most dangerous political families in the world.Like, that's a lot, right? Around the time the dictator was thrown into the mix (probably two-thirds of the way into the story), I was already tired of keeping track of the various spy shit going on, and the last thing I needed was for Silva to add yet another complication to the mix. And what a complication it is. I had been enjoying the book up until then, because there was a lot of good stuff about art theft and forgery, and Allon is a great protagonist - he won me over early in the book when he's going to the Lake Como house to investigate the murder scene, and when the cop on duty tells Allon that he has one hour, and that he'll be following Allon around the house, Allon snaps \"I'll take as long as I want, and you'll wait outside.\" (Quote is not exact, because audiobook.) Also I mentally cast Oscar Isaac as Allon, which certainly didn't hurt. I was on board for all the art forgery stuff and tracking the thieves, but then we introduce the dictator, and Silva takes us on a chapter-long digression to explain the history of the dictator's rule. And before I knew it, my fun art heist caper was gone, and had been replaced by a dreary political thriller. Not that there's anything wrong with those kind of books, but it definitely wasn't what I signed up for, and I finished the book feeling almost like I had been the victim of a bait-and-switch.The writing is good, the plot is complex and fast-paced, and all the characters that Allon works with over the course of his assignment were interesting and well-drawn (also I could read an entire book about Allon's Italian spy wife, Chiara), but ultimately, the change from art heist to political spy thriller was too jarring, and I could never adjust. Silva's books were recommended to me by someone who has the same taste in detective novels as I do, and I don't want to discount his work based just on this one book. I'd definitely be willing to give Gabriel Allon and Silva another chance in the future; this one just wasn't quite what I was expecting."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara", "userReview": "3.5 stars Gabriel Allon - 5'8\", slim and attractive.....with striking green eyes - is a man of many talents. He's one of the best art restorers (and forgers) in the world; a top-notch Israeli intelligence agent; a capable assassin; and a first class strategist/technician for covert operations.As the book opens Allon and his second wife Chiara - who's expecting twins - are living in Venice, Italy where Allon is restoring artwork in a church. Allon's quiet life is disrupted when he' s approached by General Ferrari - head of the art recovery squad - who's determined to retrieve a Caravaggio painting stolen decades ago. Ferrari believes Jack Bradshaw - a murdered British expat living in Lake Como - may have known the whereabouts of the Caravaggio. Thus, Ferrari coerces Allon to investigate Bradshaw's death - and hopefully find the masterpiece. In the course of his inquiries Allon learns that unscrupulous bigwigs, including mafia dons and dictators, collect stolen art to use as a kind of currency. Moreover, one of the Middle East's most ruthless tyrants - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - is amassing a large collection of stolen art. Al-Assad views this as a kind of insurance, in case he's ousted and can't access his hidden billions. Allon hatches an elaborate scheme to part al-Assad with his fortune and to find the Caravaggio. The plan involves selling a forgery of Van Gogh's painting 'Sunflowers' (painted by Allon) to al-Assad's buyer and to hack al-Assad's secret accounts and steal the cash. For the hacking scheme Allon's team co-opts a woman named Jawal Nawaz - a Syrian-born, German citizen who works in a bank that al-Assad uses.Allon's plan requires lots of travel plus assistance from various 'series regulars' including Ari Shamron - former head of 'The Office' (the Israeli spy agency ); Eli Lavon - an ex-spy who's now an archaeologist; Uzi Navot - the current director of The Office; Navot's wife Bella - an expert on Syria and terrorists; and Christopher Keller - an assassin turned good guy (sort of). Several features of Allon's plan are completely unbelievable (for example, a banker keeps the only records of al-Assad's secret bank accounts in a notebook in his pocket).....but this is a novel after all. LOLIn the midst of all the action Allon visits his first wife Leah in a psychiatric hospital. Leah lost her sanity after being injured by a bomb that killed her (and Allon's) son Daniel. Leah's mind replays the bombing constantly, but she has occasional moments of clarity - and these scenes are disturbing and sad. I won't say any more about the plot, except that Allon shows he's an honorable, stand-up guy.Many reviewers remark that Daniel Silva's 'Gabriel Allon' stories are formulaic, and they are. But the books are well-written - with good plots and interesting characters.

Can it really be summer without time spent with my fave Mossad assassin and art restorer? I think not. Every year I have the publication date marked in my calendar, and eagerly await the new release of one of my fave characters in a contemporary series. As I look at my reviews of the previous books in this series, I see that my ratings have been dropping, but how can I resist attending the reunion of the Barak team every summer?This one is the worst in the series so far. It is rather formulaic and the writing seems rote. The characters are recycled without any additional depth added. The story is almost the same as a couple others in the series, just updated with Syrian troubles. I almost did not finish it, and that makes me sad. If you have yet to read about the exploits of the man named like an archangel, I would highly recommend reading some of the earlier books in this series. But skip this one.And yet.

Over many years of reading, favorites have emerged - characters whose personalities are so appealing that I look forward to reading about them again and again and, were it possible, with whom I'd love to share a beer (or two) and what I have no doubt would be interesting conversation for a couple of hours.These guys have been on my Top 10 list for quite some time now (in case any are unfamiliar to other readers who might want to give them a try):10. Forest ranger Joe Pickett (author C.J. Box) 9. Manhattan bookstore owner and part-time burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr (Lawrence Block)8. Prison chaplain and former police officer John Jordan (Michael Lister) 7. Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agent Virgil Flowers (John Sandford) 6. Psychologist and police consultant Dr. Alex Delaware (Jonathan Kellerman)5. Cleveland private eye Milan Jacovich (Les Roberts) 4. The mysterious Roarke, husband of police lieutenant Eve Dallas (J.D. Robb, a.k.a. Nora Roberts) 3. British 007 agent James Bond (Ian Fleming)2. Boston private investigator Spenser (Robert B. Parker) And in the No. 1 spot? None other than art restorer and accomplished Israeli spy Gabriel Allon, who's the star of this book. In it - the 14th in the series - his beautiful (and younger) wife, Chiara, is pregnant with twins; they've been living in Vienna, where Gabriel is helping restore a major work of art. When a friend discovers the torture and murder of a former British diplomat who apparently has turned to trafficking stolen art, Gabriel begins to investigate - learning that the works of art may be a cover for a Syrian dictator to hide scandalous amounts of money. The chase, as usual, takes Gabriel to several countries where he dons different disguises as he and his team put together an involved operation to bring the dictator to his knees and, hopefully, locate the stolen art (in particular, a Caravaggio that's been missing for decades).Many characters from previous books return in this one, and perhaps a little too much space is given up to explanations of who they are for the benefit, I suppose, of making sure new readers know the background rather than simply trying to fill up pages. Also, the ending is predictable and a bit abrupt - reasons that prompted me to give this one 4 stars rather than 5 (although I'm willing to go 4-1/2 if that were possible).But in the end, it's a great adventure and a pleasure to read. I always enjoy the historical information that's sprinkled liberally throughout (even if it's not always factual).

Repetition does not have to be a bad thing if it is clever, but I fear such was not the case with his latest installment in the series. I have read them all, so I feel equipped to pass this judgement.Allon is, as ever, stiff and utterly humorless, but in the past his team or Keller have somewhat balanced that deficit. Unfortunately, his team plats only a tiny part in this story. Another issue I take with this book is the way a Silva connected the art heist with current events in Syria. It felt forced and almost as though he was taking advantage of the tragedy to sell a book. This is probably unfair, but it bothered me nonetheless. In terms of the writing and art historical research, this book was on par with others in the series. I particularly enjoyed learning more about Caravaggio, an artist I have always found quite intriguing.All in all, however, this book just wasn't what I hoped it would be.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"}, {"userName": "Jeffrey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/747648-jeffrey", "userReview": "Daniel Silva's latest Gabriel Allon novel \"The Heist\" is a decent enough read, but it lacks the panache of the earlier books in the series and the essential characteristics of a thriller. The entire novel is predictable, except for the ending, which is a big let down. The series has always been formulaic, but Silva has been able to put Allon in new situations, new plots and still keep the action semi-fresh. Although every book starts the same as Allon is interrupted restoring a famous masterpiece, investigates on his own or with a few others some nefarious situation, then calls in his special group, who all convene, smarter than any other spy or terrorist, and destroy in most cases the fiendish terrorist or enemy. I was still kind of believable for the familiarity and because Silva is a good writer.Long time fans are probably very satisfied with this book, but anyone who likes a good thriller that has thrills and murders, a traitor or two, should look elsewhere. This is like seeing a lion in a zoo instead of in the wild. They both look the same, but one is a savage beast and one is not.\"The Heist\" starts off well. Julian Isherwood, the owner of an esteemed English gallery and Allon's sometimes secret helper is found by the Italian police in the home of a murdered art dealer - Jack Bradshaw, who turns out to be an ex-agent of MI6. The Italian Art Squad extorts Allon into investigating, and from these small beginnings, Allon swiftly figures out that Bradshaw was a dealer in stolen art that was being sold to a mysterious figure, who may have possession of a classic piece stolen many years ago. But really, why would Allon even agree. Its just not believable.Swiftly Allon plans to lure out the big player by offering him a stolen masterpiece, and the action is interesting if somewhat uneventful, but the plan backfires as the courier is taken off the board.But naturally a lead develops -- how --the dead guy left an envelope specifically addressed for Allon, which lays out who Bradshaw was working with and who is Mr. Big.And now, Allon assembles his team to go after Mr. Big, who is more than any old art collector, but the head of an evil nation state. Does the plan work, it could but there is a setback, a captured innocent who must be traded for a ton of cash.Close out.Move on, try your luck somewhere else."}, {"userName": "Tucker Elliot", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7429283-tucker-elliot", "userReview": "\u201cEvil Incorporated\u201dThere are plenty of action/thriller writers who try to capture \u201cripped from the headlines\u201d issues and pontificate upon them within the confines of a fictional story, but mostly their efforts feel biased or partisan and all they really accomplish is to ruin an otherwise good story.

But it's more of the same Silva stuff, no creativity here. Daniel Silva clings to the formula he has been using since 'The Kill Artist', where Allon appears for the first time, and he only has to add some updates on the Middle East struggles, some new female character who will have a key-role in the whole operation, and, hey presto!, a new book comes out.This time, the background is Syria, and it's kind of amazing how Silva manages to link that conflict to the stealing of Old Masters' works. Yes, I know it's only fiction, but it felt a bit forced. I was also a bit annoyed with the expressions the author used, for instance, in the dialogues. I have to admit that I really dislike when people say \"what's that?\" in a conversation, when they want the other person to repeat what was said. So Silva decided (I don't know if he did that on the previous book, because I cannot remember) to \"plant\" this expression everywhere in this book. My eyes rolled so much during this reading.Concerning the language and writing style, still, there was another thing that annoyed me, also in the dialogues, and it was the way Gabriel talked with other characters. It was so ominous and mystery-like, with Gabriel always having the last word.Now that I think of it, I'm a little sick with Gabriel Allon. He's becoming a god-like character, that does everything really well, everyone looks up to him. The man is a hero and fourteen books of this is becoming a little too much.But, despite these rantings against Silva and Allon, I am pretty confident that I will read the next book.

In the second half the book picked up some, there were some exciting developments and it started to at least remind of the usual Silva. But then by the ending the story just fizzled out. The conclusion was rather weak and unsatisfactory, at least for me - no \"good guys win if not the war then definitely this battle\". Not what I usually expect from Silva. It's one of the worst and weakest Allon books I've read. And since I'm a kinda die-hard Silva fan I've read them all. It starts to look like Daniel Silva is running out of ideas what to do with his creation Gabriel Allon. I noticed this trend sometime ago. The last several books were kind of floundering back and forth. For me this fluctuation started with the Portrait of a Spy. The Rembrandt Affair was one of my favorites but after that began these ups and downs. But I guess we can't demand constant success from an author in 14 book series.

Bullshit.So we take half the book to look for the painting, blah-blah-blah boring. Whoa! There's a Syrian connection! Now we have an Allon-worthy mission: hurt Bash-Ass, the despot of Syria. So, a little spying, a little planning, and a cool operation, worthy of an exciting short story. It goes wrong, of course, in the way every single Allon novel has gone wrong, by the bad guys figuring it out and taking a hostage. So-o-o predictable. But something new: Allon doesn't get the girl back with clever heroics. No. He just does what the terrorists want. Cool. No excitement, no challenge, no danger. Just give in. It's easy that way.As if that wasn't enough of a yawner, most of the book is filler, telling from an omniscient narrator that drains any remaining tension from the story. It's like Silva had an idea for a story, half-thought out, and he let an intro-to-creative writing class do the writing.Yuk.What I don't know is: were all of them terrible and I just didn't notice? I know I'm more critical now than I was a year or two ago.Weird."}, {"userName": "In\u00eas Beato", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2781052-in-s-beato", "userReview": "J\u00e1 tinha saudades do Gabriel Allon, dachiara e de toda a fant\u00e1stica equipa do departamento! Esta nova obra de Daniel Silva volta a levar-nos aos obscuros meandros dos neg\u00f3cios de arte e, apesar de uma hist\u00f3ria muito bem engendrada e interessante, tem consideravelmente menos ac\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica que os anteriores livros da s\u00e9rie. Talvez por Gabriel estar mais velho e a fam\u00edlia prestes a crescer, esteja a resguardar-se mais na sua intelig\u00eancia e estrat\u00e9gia do que na for\u00e7a. O livro aborda tamb\u00e9m v\u00e1rios temas delicados e muito actuais, como a situa\u00e7\u00e3o na S\u00edria e o Estado Isl\u00e2mico. N\u00e3o o considerei o melhor livro de Silva, mas \u00e9 uma excelente obra ainda assim, a f\u00f3rmula bem sucedida continua a resultar, com hist\u00f3rias viciastes, personagens queridas dos leitores e sempre com algumas das principais cidades da Europa e Israel como pano de fundo. adorei, como sempre :)4.5 estrelas"}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "This is an exciting read, tying the worlds of stolen art, espionage and the current world of global, especially middle eastern, unrest. Gabriel Allon begins here as art restorer and it is knowledge of art that opens up much of the action of this novel --- into the world of stolen masterpieces, the use of art as a cash substitute, the link to ruthless regimes. All of which brings a link to the terrible carnage currently under way in the Middle East.For once though, Allon is on a different course. Not the blood-filled course of a spy this time, but the high-tech, modern spy with similar yet slightly different motives and means.Highly recommended for Daniel Silva readers. This continues to be a great series."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10553886-joan", "userReview": "I am actually giving this review 3 1/2 stars. I have read all the books and recently with my husband have listened to the audio books up to The Rembrandt Affair. The last two in this series lack the action and drama of the others. I don't need the blood and gore of Moscow Rules, but this book in particular had very little thrill and suspense. Same old, same old stuff.I think too, that the transition to chief and children may change Gabriel. But there is nice young crew to step up the action. I hope that happens soon.

Unfortunately for us Allon fans, Silva should just put a sticker on the front of the book that says 'Allon fans skip to page 83 for the story to begin.' My biggest complaint about Daniel Silva is that all Allon books start out the same way, with some small delta to keep them from being complete reprints. Julian Isherwood is always tempted or blackmailed into finding Allon, typically lying on a scaffold under a church ceiling in Venice with Ciara flitting around just out of sight until some law enforcement officer or other power broker enlists his help in solving the insoluble. In this case, once you get past page 83, the storyline gets interesting because Silva, like Brad Thor's latest, gets into current geopolitical messes and tries to do his part to alleviate the suffering. In the case of The Heist, it's the Assad regime's barbarous killing of all opposition, in great part reminiscent of Saddam Hussein, but in this case he doesn't stop short of pointing the finger at Obama's impotence in doing anything other than saber rattling while the murder continues. I mean, if gassing his Sunni opponents isn't enough like genocide of Kurds on a mountain in NW Iraq, what'll it take to help the poor helpless folks in Syria out? One must figure they're doomed if he wouldn't even rescue the ambassador in Benghazi, right? So props to Silva for tackling a current world cancer cell. The storyline is great, and to me Dan Silva has an understated approach to nearly all interpersonal relationships that brands him. Everybody except the hoodlums destined for elimination are mysterious, but in The Heist we learn that Allon's finally taking over as head of Mossad and the twins Ciara's carrying will be born without evil interference. The Heist is well worth the price of admission if you can accept reading the first 82 pages that redefine Deja vu.SPOILER PLOT SUMMARY FOLLOWS:The Missing Caravaggio. Once again, Julian Isherwood is sucked into a sham mission to Lake Como, taking the place of his fellow bar monger Oliver Dimbleby. Once he arrives at the address in Como he discovers the badly mutilated remains of Jack Rutledge, former SAS turned art thief. Julian is arrested and the Italian Art Squad CO uses his friendship with Gabriel Allon to blackmail Allon into helping him solve Rutledge's murder and to find missing artwork that had been stolen, including the Caravaggio altarpiece. As soon as Allon gets to Como and searches the estate, evidence of Rutledge's criminal past is evident by the huge number of stolen pieces of art, three of which Allon finds have been covered with new paintings to conceal the identity of the very valuable pieces. A partial clue left by Rutledge leads Allon to his first sniff of Syrian involvement, which is proven beyond a doubt when he enlists his Swiss spook Christophe Bittel into allowing him access to Rutledge's module in the Geneva Freeport--an area set aside for tax-free storage and work. There he finds a three page letter written to Allon hidden in a floor safe that outlines the Syrian hoarding of valuable artwork, much as the Nazis did. The Syrian interest is to move money out of Syria into safe offshore places in anticipation of the Assad family's ultimate demise and removal from Syria. Allon, a few months from taking over the Office (aka Mossad) and six months from welcoming twins into the world as a father, decides to beat the Syrians at their own game by leaning on a team of Office hackers who access Syrian accounts and set up the back doors for transfers at the appointed time. Allon is pointed to a small bank in Linz, Austria, that was on the brink of failure when a new partner, Waleed al-Siddiqi buys in and sets up a way station for moving money around for the Assad family, all actions directed by Finance Minister Kemel al-Farouk. Like the Sunnis of Iraq, the Alamites control all in Syria, but they are a minority with clout and barbarity. Allon recruits the Syrian accounts manager, Jihan Hawaz, and prepares for the takedown and disappearance of Jihan. Just as they are ready to push the button on the takedown, the Syrian Mukabarak discover that Jihan was born in Hama, a stronghold of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood that was destroyed and nearly all residents killed. Performing one last dangerous pickup for Waleed, Jihan goes to Geneva and is snatched by the Mukabarak's killer Omari, who is ready to torture her to death to learn her secrets. She brilliantly executes a cover to keep her alive until Allon can find her, contacting Omari via Waleed's cell phone. Ultimately, Allon trades the $8.2B the Office has snatched for Jihan's life and feels redeemed. Uzi Navot, in his first op working under Allon plants a car bomb that takes out Kemel al-Farouk. Driving back from Switzerland with Ciara, they stop by Rutledge's Como estate one last time, find nothing and walk to a church across the street. Allon's lizard brain notes an ugly altarpiece at the church that Rutledge had given them, and finds the Caravaggio hidden underneath the ugly painting covering it."}], "description": "Gabriel Allon, art restorer and occasional spy, searches for a stolen masterpiece by Caravaggio in #1 New York Times bestselling author Daniel Silva\u2019s latest action-packed tale of high stakes international intrigue.Sometimes the best way to find a stolen masterpiece is to steal another one . . .
