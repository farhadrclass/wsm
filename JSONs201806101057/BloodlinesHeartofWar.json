Donovan parachutes behind enemy lines in France, in order to help secure a base of operations in preparation for the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France. Of course, nothing is as easy as it sounds, and Donovan lands without his equipment bag, no weapon, and a German patrol passing by. And his story just gets scarier and more dangerous from there, but ultimately, courage and determination guide his actions to the end of the mission.The second story is also set in WWII and is an exciting saboteur tale. Michael Donovan\u2019s brother, First Lieutenant Aaron Donovan is part of the U.S. Army\u2019s Office of Strategic Services. His mission is to board a German submarine located in Gilleleje, Denmark, sabotage it so that the Germans will have to evacuate the sub, and while that is happening, Donovan and his companion are to steal the new codebooks for decoding the latest Enigma codes. It\u2019s a daring mission, not everything goes a planned, but again Donovan strength and courage win the day.A third Donovan brother is a U.S. Marine Captain Everett Donovan during the Korean War. Captain Donovan finds himself the only survivor of\u2026what? He couldn\u2019t remember, but he can figure out that he is in North Korea and the temperature is 35\u00b0 below zero. With the bayonet of a Korean sniper aimed at him, Donovan suddenly remembers his mission - he and his Counterintelligence Marines were supposed to scout the area known as Toktong Pass, making sure it is clear for U.S. and U.N. Forces to advance through in the morning. But this Korean sniper had a real surprise for Captain Donovan.In this fourth story, we meet the Donovan brothers cousin, Private First Class Tony Donovan of the U.S. Army\u2019s 249th Engineer Battalion, who is also stationed in Korea. When a C-119 cargo plane crashes behind enemy with Donovan and his men on it, they know they had to get out of that area and back to safety as quickly a possible. But first they had to try and repair a jeep they were carrying. And even at that, getting back to safety provea to be a dangerous trek, especially when a North Korean tank gets the jeep full of soldiers in it\u2019s sights. How will they ever survive a hit from a tank?Next is the story of Everett Donovan\u2019s son, Lieutenant Verner Donovan, Everett\u2019s son, a pilot in the VF-96 \u201cFighting Falcons\u201d Squadron, part of the U.S. Navy. Verner, known as the \u201cCandy Man\u201d because of his fondness for chocolate, is stationed on a aircraft carrier in Vietnam. When he and his RIO (radio intercept officer) Blem receive a radio transmission from Marine recon unit Razor Two requesting air support after having stumbled into a Vietcong training camp, the two men spring into action. Locating the Marines, they soon discover they aren\u2019t the only ones in the air - so are the enemy and the two men are forced to parachute out of the plane. Now, it is the Candy Man and Blem who need help. Will they make it out of the Vietcong jungle? Also in Vietnam is Captain Anne Donovan, a U.S. Army nurse, and Verner\u2019s sister. Finding herself in a M.A.S.H. unit, providing medical care to badly wounded and dying soldiers, Anne has something to prove - that she has what it takes to be a doctor some day. When she finds herself assisting a doctor during the Battle of Hamburger Hill, she learns the most valuable lesson of all - how to keep her emotions distanced from the carnage all around her in order to be strong for the soldiers who need her.Lieutenant Commander Lester Donovan, Verner\u2019s son and Anne\u2019s nephew, is a U.S. Navy Seal stationed in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Lester was a by-the-book officer, but the men he commanded wanted to see a little flexibility when needed. When the helicopter carrying Lester, his men and a Taliban prisoner is shot out of the sky, Donovan knows he has a difficult choice to make - obey orders or defy them and search for his two missing men, taken prisoner by the Taliban and hidden in a dark cave. But which cave? There are so many used by the Taliban. This last story also features Lieutenant Commander Lester Donovan, now serving in Iraq. Based on information given to them by Iraqi Police Chief Hakedam, a supporter of Saddam Hussein\u2019s old ruling party, Donovan, two of his men and a CIA agent hope to capture a black marketer and terrorist, Abdul Kasieem, whose stronghold is camouflaged as a goat farm near the Syrian border, and which contains an underground bunker loaded with weapons. But has the Police Chief played the Americans so that they would get rid of Kasieem and he, Hakedam, could be the only black marketer in town? Bloodlines: Hear of War is a very well-done collection of short stories for middle grade readers, many of who really like these types of military tales. There are lots of details about the conflicts that the Donovans find themselves fighting in, but they are not terribly graphic, though they are realistic. And even though I\u2019m not a fan of combat stories, I did find them somewhat interesting. I like the way the author connected the family to each other in the stories. I know there are lots of military families like the Donovans, who will also find this and interesting book. There not much background as to what each war is about within the stories, however, there is a brief description of each of these U.S. Military Conflicts at the back of the book. I would have liked to see suggestions for further reading as well, but I did read an ARC so many the finished book has these things. Maybe kids who read and enjoy Bloodlines: Heart of War will be inspired to seek out more information about each conflict on their own.This book is recommended for readers age 9+This book was an EARC received from NetGalleyThis review was originally posted at The Children's War"}, {"userName": "Ty Dettman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72066280-ty-dettman", "userReview": "Heart of war, a book in the Bloodlines series, is a thrilling book involving personal experiences. For all of the characters in the book used a World war I trench lighted at some point in there personal experience as its passed down the generations.Connections Made(Self, World, Text)I was able to connect to the characters throughout the book to other books and War-related movies. They all have the same task that seems impossible to overcome yet there is a completely logical explanation and thought out a plan to explain how they overcame a treacherous fate.I loved everything about this book. It had a pretty simple but effective way of gettings it points across and letting the reader understand what was happening. The Author did an amazing job I wouldn't change a thing.

Zachary Sherman is a story of the Donovan family and their history of service for the United States. It takes you through 4 generations of War. Starting in World War 2. Me, the reader, got a personal and up close account of what war is really like. There was a twist around every corner that made want to keep reading. \tI connected to this book with a lot of World War II movies I\u2019ve watched. They both have similar plots and storyline. In both of them, there are obstacles to conquer that seem really almost impossible. It always ends with the characters achieving the impossible and showing how strong the United States armed forces are. The book may be meant for younger ages, but I still enjoyed it. \tI liked the book. At times it was like I couldn\u2019t stop reading, and at other moments I couldn\u2019t even get myself to pick the book up. Because the stories were from 4 generations of a family, some parts were better than others. Overall the book was good though. I would recommend it to anyone who likes books about war."}], "description": "A heart-pounding, action-packed tale of combat and kinship skillfully crafted by United States Marine Corps veteran and acclaimed comics writer M.
