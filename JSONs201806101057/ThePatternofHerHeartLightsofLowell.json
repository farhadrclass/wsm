We start our visit back with Jasmine and Nolan Houston, and their great family. Alice Ann has survived Scarlet Fever, and life is good.

I like how the authors concluded the stories of the characters....at least for all but 3 people that is. I am saddened that Moses didn't get his parents back! I know he has Simon and Maisie, but I waited the whole book to see Moses be reunited with Obadiah & Naomi, or at least to find out what happened to them, and was really disappointed at the end."}, {"userName": "Denise Lyon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1996498-denise-lyon", "userReview": "The book was very good, but disappointed that Jasmine and Nolan did not even try to look for Moses's parents or even run across them.

Jasmine gets an unexpected visit from her father's attorney. His news of her father and brothers deaths due to a epidemic sends her into a depressed state, but the news that her and mckinley are the heirs of their father's plantation are somewhat concerning. Her father's last wish was for them to return to the plantation and bring in the last crop. Nolan, Jasmine and their 3 children return without Mckinley who refuses to leave his business or his pregnant wife. Paddy is left in charge of the horse business which is a great feet for an Irish boy. He doesn't let them down. Jasmine and Nolan set the her father's slaves free and allow them to choose to help with the crops for a wage. This new treatment of the freed slaves causes a stir with the other plantation owners. Upon the spreading of this news, the Willows is burned and the slaves taken away, leaving the Houston family destitute and running of the threat to their lives. They feel the real threat as the escape under the cover of darkness as so many slaves had. One of her remaining cousins, Rupert is behind these hanus acts and tries to steal the Willows too. After return to the North, Mckinley doesn't believe in Jasmine's tale, but believes Rupert had been misunderstood. Mckinley later finds this to be false when Rupert sets a plan in place to go back on another arrangement of the return of the freed slaves. Meanwhile, the cotton mills are in dire straights with layoffs and the closure of boarding houses. Elinor finds a connection to Reggie the new preachers daughter and through their friendship she finds the barricade around her heart to break and acknowledges her love for both Reggie and her father. They are married along with one of her boarders, Mary Margarite to Paddy. Trust that was put in the Lord to answer prayer was well founded even when faith was lacking. Family importance was centered on as the Wainwright family was almost all lost to tragedy except for Jasmine and Mckinley and a few cousins and a distant uncle Levi who aided in the escape and return of the willows to jasmine."}, {"userName": "Massanutten Regional Library", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39496195-massanutten-regional-library", "userReview": "Sue, North River patron, June 2016, 5 stars:Third in a series, Book #1 A Tapestry of Hope, #2 A Love Woven True, #3 The Pattern of Her Heart.

The main story includes intense drama as Jasmine and her husband Nolan travel back to the Southern plantation she inherited from her father. With the intention of freeing her deceased father's slaves, tragedy leads them on a dangerous trek to their home in the North. Less drama highlights several others in the town where Elinor, a widow, runs a boardinghouse which rooms many young women who work at the local cotton mill. When the handsome widowed Pastor and his young teenage daughter arrived in town, the gossipy church ladies have their eye on him for their own daughters to hopefully marry. Other stories are mingled in which got a little confusing with so many characters. So it was an OK read for me."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1449145-karen", "userReview": "The saga of Nolan and Jasmine Huston continues with the emphasis in this part of the trilogy being on emancipating slaves and helping them to get on their feet. Mixed in is the Irish flavor of Paddy, Bridget and Mary Margaret, with this book not as much concentrating on their struggle to become part of the culture but their relationships with each other. The history of the cotton milling industry in America is the backdrop. The boardinghouses and working conditions help weave more characters into the story line. The plot line keeps moving and switches from one group to another. All in all a pretty good book."}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1065386-michele", "userReview": "Another book in this series that takes place in both Mississippi and Massachusetts as the issue of slavery divides friends, families and the country. In this book, we see Jasmine and her family facing more heartache than most people will ever face. It follows them as they try to lean on God even when He seems to be nowhere near. Although there was a fair amount of pain and heartbreak in this book, there was also plenty of uplifting events. No profanity or sex.

I think I finished the entire series in just a couple of weeks - woven with love, faith, even a bit of suspense, Tracie's books take me back in time and are so descriptive. I find myself hearing the voices of the characters speaking in their native dialect and seeing the emotion on their faces through their times of triumph and trial. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading Tracie's books and haven't found one that I have not appreciated."}], "description": "When tragedy strikes, Jasmine Houston must uproot her family from the Northern mill town of Lowell and take over her family's Southern plantation, The Willows.
