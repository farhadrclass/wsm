It's basically a guy's version of a romance novel. Spies! Bad guys! Action! Cheesy dialog! It's a literary version of the television show 24.That said, any story involving Mitch Rapp is a page turner, no matter how poorly written or how much the author's disdain for things like the UN, diplomacy, and liberal universities seep through the story.Break down:+ 4 stars for mostly gripping story- 1 star for a totally lame way to off the antagonist- 1 star for awkward discussions and moments involving Mitch's wife and his boss.That leaves us with 2 stars.

There were three main plot elements and as it transpired there wasn't a great deal to link them in the end.You can't fault Vince Flynn's ability to add a good bit of action/adrenaline sequence in which is what we got with a hostage rescue mission in the Philippines but there was no real need for this in the greater scheme of things. It's almost like the main plot wasn't long enough or filled with enough testosterone for the publishers so they copied and pasted this into the story. The main plot itself was the usual terrorist scenario but trying to aid Palestine which was a new angle for me. There were a few info dumps I found interesting as I have no knowledge of the strife in this part of the world but the plot itself was a little drawn out and then ended all too quickly.I have a small concern for the series going forward as Mitch Rapp (the main guy/badass) has hung up his pistols to have a more sober office job and the family life. As previously stated, it is the action scenes that draw me in here and I just don't see where they are going to come from now.I will continue this series though even with slight concerns on the direction it will take as Vince Flynn was a great author able to weave a complex, action fuelled tale.If you like this try \"Killing Floor\" by Lee Child or \"24\" by Keifer Sutherland"}, {"userName": "Ashish Iyer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38414168-ashish-iyer", "userReview": "Seemed to be shorter than other Mitch Rapp books but had all of the elements you come to expect for this series.

I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the previous 5 Mitch Rapp books, however, this story was somewhat slower than the others. Since Mitch's cover was blown in the previous book, Separation of Powers, Flynn sends Mitch's character in another direction. It appears that Mitch's life is now more administrative and husbandly that ever before. He is desperately trying to leave his life of killing behind for a more normal life. He struggles with his wife's persistence that he completely detaches himself from his past. This becomes a serious problem. (He really needs to put her in her place. She can be a real bitch sometimes.) There was a lot more political twists and turns in this novel instead of the typical dark, quiet, incredibley descriptive assassinations that Mitch is so great at. That being said, Mitch still comes through as a great American hero, in the fact that he can only take so much of the office life before he just has to get involved.I still liked this book very much, however, I can only hope that Mitch plays more of the assassin role in the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Samuel ", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20026692-samuel", "userReview": "THE UNIONS \u201cNever interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.\u201d- Napoleon. Welcome to the second story arc of the Mitch Rapp saga. I like to call this one the \"matrimony arc\", due to it spanning Mr Rapp's marriage. Don't worry though. White picket fences aren't for the war on terror's blunt instrument, and the three acts that make up this part of the series features some of the more severe threats Rapp encounters. Back in the day, before Al Quaeda and Daesh made the Middle East a constantly burning geopolitical hot spot, the main political problem in the region was the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A lesson on how chronic backstabbing, cynicism and unhealthy levels of sometimes justifiable paranoia can screw up the best laid plans, and break the most wide-eyed idealists, even with more pressing issues taking the center stage, it continue on with no end in sight. Mr Flynn said Executive Power was a parable of sorts. Of how whatever moralizing and idealism had been sucked out of the war. And how the Palestinians had been reduced to nothing but a mere foreign policy implement by Middle Eastern nations who wished to use and abuse them as a cudgel to bash Israel. Now, the thing about this book is that it's actually two stories which are disconnected throughout much of the book. Normally such a disjointed feel would have brought down a lesser writer. But Mr Flynn saves it with some great plotting, and the introduction of a character who manages to steal the show from Mitch Rapp. Now to the review. Government assassins never die. But do they fade away? The novel begins in the Philippines. DEVGRU are attempting to make an insertion on an island. Unfortunately, they're rumbled, met with a welcome committee and forced to withdraw with casualties. Across the Pacific, the newly wed Mitch Rapp and his wife Ann relax on their honeymoon. While mostly happy, Rapp is still annoyed about having been burned in the last book. In Monte Carlo, a Palestinian agent provocateur meets with a patron he loathes to begin the implementation of a very complex business proposal. And back in Langley Virginia, DCI Irene Kennedy is working overtime on a special project, intending to make an example of those who forget \"loose lips sink ships\". These threads come together to create one of the more audacious schemes Mitch Rapp has faced. Okay, in terms of plot, Executive Power is a mixed bag. Primarily due to the anti-climax of the ending but mostly due to the previously mentioned disconnect between the two plotlines. For some, it can seem Flynn was trying to write two different stories. Nevertheless, one of them, featuring the Palestinian agent provocateur, is some of Flynn's best writing, while the other, Mitch Rapp's Philippine business trip, has a few good action scenes, despite being a bit more bland at times. The settings are also a bit more varied compared to later Mitch Rapp novels. Sure, Washington features, but a third of the book takes place in the Philippine jungle at night and the Gaza strip. Flynn successfully captures the claustrophobia of the former and the gritty wretchedness of the latter. As for the main research, it's once again classic Flynn. Some pretty exotic kit such as the excellent AS-VAL rifle and the classic, All-American Barett M82 feature prominently, along with jungle warfare/surveillance tactics. Now to the characters. Only two standouts this time around. First Mitch as always. This is the book where his \"badass\" credentials started to become more apparent, especially since this was his coming out the DC's legion of bureaucratic busy-bodies who would come to hate and fear him. From laying down the law on a hapless paper-pusher who catastrophically forgot about the things he wasn't supposed to have said, to taking on half the Abu Sayaf organization with nothing but a few friends and his suppressed Beretta 92FS, this is the book which signaled Mitch's evolution from just another government assassin, to the man who quite possibly inspired Jack Bauer. But unfortunately, Mitch was faced by someone who completely stole the show from him. And it's the antagonist of all people, a character who is by far the most sympathetic and complex villain in the Mitch Rapp series. Meet David, real name Jabril. He's an agent provocateur. While loathing Israel's law enforcement and intelligence community, he also despises the collection of terrorist organizations who have set up shop in his neck of the woods. So, following that timeless Middle Eastern proverb, \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\", he forms a short-lived partnership with Mossad to decapitate the terrorist leadership. He does his job but due to the jackass director general of Mossad cocking things up with an Apache helicopter, decides to go after Israel as well. Unlike your usual Middle Eastern villain, David isn't a homicidal mass murderer. He's got brains, and thinks up a far more brilliant and insidious scheme at getting even. By the end, near the climax, he manages to have his target teetering on the edge of diplomatic oblivion as their only ally considers throwing them under the bus for the Mossad director's mistake. It's tragic that Jabril and Rapp never got to have a confrontation, but it's also unfortunate that Flynn never again tried to make his antagonists as captivating or complex as David. So, Executive Power? Overall, it's a mixed bag. While the some of the story arcs drag the book down, it's saved by Mitch's evolution into the counter-terrorist operative we all know and love, along with Flynn's best antagonist executing the false flag operation to end all false flag operations.

They had a mix of fast action, believable world stage espionage and a fairly linear yet enjoyable plot line. However the series have definitely been plagued by storyline fatigue.

I felt Flynn dropped the ball at the end and I had to take away a star. Two stars the first time I listened to this, four stars this time round. The first time I listened to this I didn't know where Flynn was going with the dual arcs - one featuring David aka Jabril Khatabi and the other, Mitch Rapp, of course. These two arcs do not come together until towards the end of the book and it took a second attempt before I could follow. My second attempt was successful because I now knew that for 80% of the way EP is like reading two separate books. I no longer tried to tie the two threads as one normally would do, and, thus, ending up frustrated. This second time around, I allowed Flynn to tell David's story and let him tie up the two threads when he was ready to do so. I would recommend anyone about to read this installment approach the book this way.Despite my enjoying the book very much, there are weak spots and the weakest was the way Flynn offed the villains - not just the scene where David and Omar are killed off (both so anti-climactic) but I felt rather mislead by Flynn where these two characters are concerned. I liked how David was portrayed - not at all the stereotypical Palestinian (or Arab, heck, the usual Middle-Eastern!) terrorist and I liked, very much, that there was that other angle, that other side, to him - a highly-educated, Renaissance man, even, who had a love for his land that is as legitimate as any Zionist's, and who hurts when the innocent are hurt in the endless battle for their slice of this planet. Omar was the stereotypical Saudi prince whose days and nights revolve around his sybaritic indulgences. He's portrayed as fat and lazy and lacking in the smarts department.With those impressions etched, unmistakably, in my mind, I was thrown for a loop when David abandons his more noble self and acts like your typical terrorist whose only goal is to see a Palestinian state regardless of the collateral damage. Where the hell did the David the Renaissance Man go and when/how did Jabril the garden-variety terrorist take his place? Then the lazy, self-indulgent, stupid Omar becomes an evil, scheming Arab prince? Not just a sudden development but a really sudden change that occurs in a single scene! I was thinking 'hey! That's not how you painted these two guys!' and either Flynn forgot how he characterized these two men or he deliberately set out to mislead me.Ah well. That said, I still enjoyed this installment, especially the DC shenanigans. Anna needs to die. Soon.----------------------------------------------REVIEW OF AUDIOBOOK; NOVEMBER 16, 2015Narrator: George GuidallI must have been very tired as I couldn't follow the story. There were two storylines going on throughout the book and seemed unconnected but you know it is so it adds to the frustration. With audio, it's even more frustrating as I couldn't go back and check for something I missed. But in the end, it didn't seem to matter because all I needed was to listen to Rapp's rant in the final quarter and got the gist of the entire book in five minutes. Samuel's review sums everything up that I want to say but can't be bothered. All through the audiobook, I kept wondering who the heck was David. The book was mostly about him, not Mitch Rapp, and I even wondered if I had picked the wrong book. But no, it was Rapp but maybe Flynn forgot. In any case, I felt somewhat derailed - it wasn't really the kind of Rapp book I've come to enjoy not just because this stranger called David hijacked it, but because Mitch is still battling that cow he's married to. There are 14 books - 7 more to go - and I'm hoping I won't have to put up with Anna for 7 more books. Not unless she gets her head straight and stop being such a pain the ass.Not an installment I enjoyed but I love Rapp in action so I'm going to check out Book 7 and see if it sounds more like the Rapp I like or I should take a break and do a serial killer instead."}, {"userName": "Linda Munro", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4285637-linda-munro", "userReview": "Every time I ordered this book from the library it would arrive with several other 7-day books and I was never able to complete the book before it had to be back.

It\u2019s a fresh look at Rapp\u2019s balance between political savviness and his kiss-my-ass approach to dealing with anything and anyone who\u2019s less than authentic & straightforward. I found the novel to be fast moving, filled with a myriad of interesting characters, but still easy to follow. To me, the two primary plots seemed to be a bit disjointed. I kept thinking the two would eventually link up at some point, but they never did. The only elements in common between the two plots were the heated dialogues that took place in the White House and the give and take between Rapp and Anna as they dealt with Rapp\u2019s passion for dangerous missions. \"Executive Power\" is a unique Rapp novel in that you are able to learn more about Mitch Rapp in this book: his personal relationship with Anna, the growing acceptance of his boss and her role, and his ability to balance politics with his desire to power through problems with brute force.All in all, it was another good Mitch Rapp novel by Vince Flynn.

These novels are always so cathartic for me in this modern world of massive bureaucracies gone mad. Flynn will expertly build this disastrous tension throughout the novel as things get worse and worse for our heroes and then finish it all off with some of the most satisfying conclusions I've ever read. It's so much fun to read these books. If, like me, you don't find many redeeming qualities in lifetime politicians, self-important bureaucrats and enormous, unwieldy government agencies which can't seem to function efficiently, Flynn's books are for you.Executive Power is the fourth novel in Flynn's Mitch Rapp series and it follows the newly \"toned down\" exploits of our recently wedded Mitch Rapp as he attempts to transition from butt kicking, black ops, field agent for the CIA to paper pushing, intelligence focused, Counter Terrorism Director for the CIA. Let's face it; Mitch ain't happy. But his lovely bride is delighted in the knowledge her husband will no longer be crawling around in Middle Eastern hot spots doing his best impression of a bullet magnet. And that's all that matters, right? Throughout Executive Power Flynn explores how Mitch is struggling to balance his promises to his new wife with the what he sees as his duty to the country he serves. We're introduced to a betrayal by our allies in the Philippines, Some underhanded dealings by the Israelis, a secret Palestinian statehood scheme and a new, resourceful mercenary operative attempting to manipulate events on the world stage.I've gotta' say, I didn't enjoy Executive Power as much as some of Flynn's previous Mitch Rapp books. Executive Power sort of felt like two novels mashed up into one. The events in the Philippines in the first half of the novel didn't mesh well with the events unfolding in the West Bank, New York and Washington D.C. in the second half. Don't get me wrong; The first half set the stage and introduced the players and the tone for the whole, but never really gelled well with the primary story being told. Having said that, I did enjoy Executive Power quite a bit, just not as much as I've enjoyed Flynn's others.I didn't spot many typos or formatting errors in my Kindle edition and thought the editing was done well despite my misgivings about the two distinct plot lines in Executive Power. The dialogue was all top-notch-Flynn-goodness being very believable and \"real\" feeling. The pacing was interesting. There was a steady build at the beginning with a fast release at the culmination of the Philippines story line to be replaced by a slower steady build through to a slower release at the end. It was all very satisfying, just maybe not as masterful as previous entries. I suppose that's always a series writer's dilemma - trying to one-up your previous novels with the knowledge they're bound to be compared to each other.There is a lot to like in Executive Power. The background cast is back, for the most part, and they're all filling their designated roles in Mitch Rapp's world in a nice, supportive way. The bureaucracy is still the bureaucracy and you loathe it just as much as you always have. The villains are back - maybe sporting different names, faces and ideologies - but they're back, none-the-less. The plot is engaging and entertaining, filled with real-world political plot elements from the 2003 era (the publication year). And despite holding down a desk job, Mitch Rapp is still kicking butt and taking names.I settled on three stars for Executive Power because I enjoyed it despite a few subtle narrative flaws.

Or there\u2019s the rubbed out bit after the \u2018all men born equal\u2019 bit. you know it, the bit that said \u2018apart from our slaves.\u2019 That\u2019s there if you look closely.But I digress.Politics-wise, Flynn again sensibly stays pretty much out of it. All politicians are soft and only concerned with lining their own nests. We know that already. The soldiers and people around Rapp, only want to do what is right, for each and every innocent and not-innocent (mostly) American person. Shooting terrorists and freeing their own. As politicians are pretty universally frowned on here and in books like this, it really makes you wonder who is running the country. Who the sensible ones are. But that isn\u2019t exclusive to the US. However, were I to take a running guess at VF\u2019s politics, based on the \u2018arguments\u2019 for \u2018getting off their ass and doing something,\u2019 I\u2019d guess he\u2019d lean more towards Trump than Clinton. Not totally out in La-La Land like Brad Thor (I\u2019d put my mortgage on that NOT being the name on his birth certificate, whaddaya think?) and the shaved orang-utan Trump, but more centre, if Yanks think Clinton is a \u2018socialist.\u2019 Anyway, he seems a decent enough guy all told.Yet, Executive Power is without doubt Vince Flynn\u2019s best Mitch Rapp book so far. And that\u2019s good as the books do seem to be getting better and better (I\u2019m reading them in the published order, so I\u2019m writing as if this is the latest book. I know there are what? 15 more and VF is now dead). It\u2019s his best by far. Better even, than American Assassin (the first)? Maybe, yeah. If Hurley and all the others who were in at the start but then\u2026well, again, we don\u2019t know because there\u2019s still the 10 year black hole (maybe Steven Hawking should be commissioned to write books from that period?). Flynn\u2019s writing, is tight and effective (whatever that means). Not sparse to the point of you wondering if they\u2019ve cut bits out, not so sparse that you wonder if the book is trying to make an idiot of you because you can't remember what that bloke was saying several hundred pages back that now you wish you could find to go read again otherwise you can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s mostly Thriller clich\u00e9-free and is now using the pieces that were set up in the previous books (well, from #3 onwards anyway) very nicely. And it makes me want to read more.I STILL don\u2019t do the wife bit. She\u2019s holding Rapp back. Hope he sees it before it\u2019s too late. And I don\u2019t get the two strands either. Totally non-connected. They\u2019re only there to show the clash between Rapp and Mrs Rapp. Which is the worst bit. She\u2019s unreasonable. She\u2019s clever enough, she should know better. I\u2019ll have to read on to find out if he sees the light.All my reviews are on Speesh ReadsSpeesh Reads is also a Facebook Page"}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1089750-robin", "userReview": "The author did something a little different in this, the fourth Mitch Rapp installment, compared to the others. He started two disparate storylines, each with its own cast of characters, ended one, and then proceeded into a third plotline that finally made the connection back to the other open line. Though the \"short\" story about a hostage rescue in the Philippines was both intense and entertaining, it was superfluous. I actually finished the book wondering if maybe I imagined that whole sequence in the beginning, it had so little relevance. Though Flynn's story construction in this one was lacking, I was still entertained. And that's what counts, isn't it? It must be, since I've already started into book 5."}, {"userName": "Douglas Barrow", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32453345-douglas-barrow", "userReview": "Superb story telling.A lone Palestinian terrorist has big plans to bring about the creation of a Palestinian state.

AVERAGE POLITICAL THRILLER."}], "description": "CIA superagent Mitch Rapp battles global terrorism in a high-octane follow-up to The New York Times bestselling Separation of Power -- another chillingly authentic adventure from the master of the political thriller. Mitch Rapp's cover has been blown. After leading a team of commandos deep into Iraq to prevent Saddam Hussein from joining the nuclear arms race, he was publicly hailed by the president as the single most important person in the fight against terrorism. But after years of working covertly behind the scenes, Rapp now lives in the glare of the public spotlight, lauded by the nation and an easy target for virtually every terrorist from Jakarta to London.As special advisor on counterterrorism to CIA director Dr. Irene Kennedy, Rapp is ready to fight the war on terrorism from CIA headquarters rather than the front line. That is, until a platoon of Navy SEALs, sent to the Philippines to save an American family kidnapped by radical Islamic terrorists, is caught in a deadly ambush. The mission had been top secret -- so who told the enemy? All evidence points to the State Department and the Philippine embassy. But a greater threat still lurks. An unknown assassin working closely with the highest powers in the Middle East is bent on igniting war. Now, with the world watching his every move, will Rapp be able to overcome this anonymous foe and once again keep the flames of war from raging?Transporting us into an intriguing geopolitical puzzle full of deadly motives, covert operatives, and all the true-to-life insider detail we've come to expect from Vince Flynn, \"Executive Power\" is a high-flying story that delivers shattering suspense with the velocity of a 9mmbullet.", "title": "Executive Power\n      \n          (Mitch Rapp #6)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/777211.Executive_Power", "average": 4.33, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442431876l/777211.jpg", "reviews": 748, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14989.Vince_Flynn", "name": "Vince Flynn"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Thriller", "Action"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/777211.Executive_Power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14501786-executive-power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17342885-executive-power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/184659.Executive_Power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29155584-executive-power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7056201-executive-power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11292396-executive-power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25393602-open-doelwit", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6438060-executive-power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1130101.Executive_Power", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7959473-american-assassin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3313418-extreme-measures", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26722.Act_of_Treason", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/184657.Memorial_Day", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154424.Consent_to_Kill", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
