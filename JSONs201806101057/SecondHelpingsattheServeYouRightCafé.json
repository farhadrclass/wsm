I didn't immediately connect with the story and found everything to be it very descriptive, sometimes overly so. Because of that, I found the pacing to be a little slow and cumbersome at times. Some of the events seemed to take a long time to happen, however, the timeframe of the story was short.Overall, I liked Second Helpings, but didn't love it.

A full-time owner/manager, a full-time baker, and one part-time server.The owner/manager, Eden Rose, is a recovering alcoholic. A woman with a big heart, an artistic flair, and a positive outlook. She smiles often. She inspires confidences.\"The urge to confide in her, which few resisted, probably had something to do with her eyes. People tended to find themselves there. Eden's eyes were a clear brown that made drunks think of smooth whiskey and nature lovers remember woodland pools. Southerners looked into her eyes and tasted the memory of sweet tea, and a homeless man saw the darkness of a place to sleep\".Emet, is a parolee recently released from prison. He is a talented and highly skilled baker who views his parole status as a gift. He NEVER wants to return to prison, and he has an admirable work ethic. In his early thirties, he has been in jail for almost ten years. He learned how to cook in prison. He calls cooking \"reliable magic\".When Emet meets a woman named Mercedes, he cannot believe his luck when she agrees to go out with him. Where she is a doctor of physiotherapy; he only has a high school diploma and a prison record.The tables are not as uneven as they seem however, because Mercedes (Mercey) comes from a severely dysfunctional family. Her baggage would break the backs of most people. Emet isn't 'most people' though.\"Some plants grow best in poor soil\"Mercy's brother is a low-life druggie who has on occasion resorted to petty crime to support his habits. When he learns of Emet, and Emet's past, he does his level best to put Emet back in prison and away from his sister, who, up until now has helped to support him.Mercey has a NEADS service dog named Serena. When her brother tries to harm Serena, Mercy reports him to the authorities. That's when things turn bad. Bad for Mercey, and by connection, bad for Emet.This lovely little book is a treatise on human nature. The good, the bad, and the ugly aspects of it. It is a story told with deep understanding, humor, and empathy. The prose at times flows almost like poetry. There is no part of this book that I didn't love. All the characters are so well rendered, that I find myself missing them already...It is my belief that this book will appeal to: people who like people, people who don't like people, people with 'baggage', people who love people who have 'baggage', dog lovers, bakers, and everyone who ever wanted or needed a second chance. Highly recommended!I received a digital copy of this novel from Linden Tree Press via Edelweiss in consideration of a review."}, {"userName": "Doug Jacobs", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20169911-doug-jacobs", "userReview": "Second Helpings at the Serve You Right Caf\u00e9 is the second outing for Tilia Klebenov Jacobs. I will again admit that I am the husband of the author, but here you will have my honest thoughts. Tilia has not read, written, edited or otherwise tampered with this review. [Scout's Honor]I love this book very much. Sit on your couch at home or an easy chair at your favorite coffee shop with a steaming cup of mocha in easy reach, and this book will match your physical comfort with some reading comfort. The characters, with the exception of the caustic brother, are loveable, their many stories are interesting, and while the stakes for Emet become fairly high, we have such a warm feeling from the way the writing brings us through the story that we know that everything will turn out right in the end. While the plot revolves around Emet and Mercey, the secondary characters are vividly drawn with the help of their compelling personal stories. I\u2019m hoping that at some point Tilia will write a story that spends more time on Isidore and Daisy, or at least that we will see them again in some other story.This book is not for kids. There is no sexuality, but some of the situations are violent; drug use is mentioned frequently; and the language used by of some of the characters is, well, the kind of language you might expect from an angry stoner when messaging with his stoner friends.I recommend this book without reservation to all who like a compelling read."}, {"userName": "Mishehu", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu", "userReview": "The author, a friend of mine, asked if I'd be willing to read her latest and submit an honest review -- a potentially fraught request that I broached with some hesitation... Having just wrapped up this slim, compelling read, I'm delighted (and greatly relieved) to be able to award my highest recommendation. In 20+ short chapters Klebenov develops a number of interesting characters, giving us a glimpse of a few pivotal days in their lives. The writing is crisp, the story interesting and one that rings true. The whole is a satisfying blend. No spoilers here. Suffice it to say, stuff happens, stuff resolves, other stuff remains appropriately undecided. In other words, the story captures both the promise and the messiness of life. If you're hankering for a good story well-told, if you like your characters charming but flawed, and if you enjoy a good scone with your coffee -- set a spell in Klenenov's cafe.

The book description (see below) had me expecting a possibly intense drama. While there is drama, it\u2019s written in such a way that makes for a good read whether you\u2019re sitting inside on a rainy day or outside in the nice cool air. Emet struggles with his emotions and perceptions of being an ex-convict having recently been released from prison. So when he meet Mercedes it\u2019s hard for him to believe that she could really like him and would want to get to know him. He\u2019s very conscious of his parole requirements. The storyline flowed well and each of the characters were well developed. The book description says \u201cher deranged brother learns about Emet\u2019s past, he will stop at nothing to destroy\u2026\u201d. I must admit this added to my assumption that this was going to be something of an intense read.

And it made me hungry, too. Emet works for Eden Rose at the Serve You Right Cafe. The pastries made me drool. I think Ms. Jacobs could write a second book that just contained the recipes for the goodies in this one.Emet has only been out of prison for a month. He has spent the last ten years in jail for manslaughter. Eden Rose feels everyone deserves a second chance and Emet is an extraordinary baker so she hires him. When we first meet these two, Emet has asked Mercy (a woman he met out and about) out on a date, and she said yes.While Emet, Mercy and Eden are central to the plot, there are a lot of secondary characters that make this a lovely read, including an elderly couple who live in the park. Ms. Jacobs writes in an author's note at the end of the book that she had all these little stories in her head and when she drove by a coffee house one day, they all came together in a fictional coffee shop in her head. I liked many of these characters, so I'm glad it gelled!Mercy's twin brother, Clay, is everything she's not. She's driven, kind, smart, and sweet. He is not. After their mother is moved into a home, he knows that Mercy is on her way out, too. He can't stand that. He deserves to be catered to, taken care of, fed, and housed, or at least that's what his stoned brains are telling him. When he sees she really is going, he decides to do everything in his power to make her stay. To say he is delusional would be an understatement. And his conniving, violent, and evil ways kept me on the edge of my seat. There were some truly wonderful lines in this book. Here are a couple:Emet smiled at her. \"Do you ever get tired of being right?\"\"Never. It's a constant thrill.\"~!~!~!~!~!~\"Everyone has a past,\" he said. \"And no one has the future. We all have now, and right now, I like what I see.\"~!~!~!~!~!~\"I live for the midnight info-dump. In fact, when I got up this morning I said to my cats, 'You know what's missing in my life? A late-night confessional to curl my toes.\"~!~!~!~!~!~\"Do you always go shopping at the Crazy Store? It sounds like you bought out their entire stock.\"~!~!~!~!~!~There were many cute moments (along with the TENSION) in this one.

The owner is Eden Rose, her pastry chef is Emet and they serve wonderful pastries and coffee to their clients everyday. The story seems rambling with almost no concrete plot except for a main theme, second chances. For Eden Rose is a recovering alcoholic and Emet has just gotten out of prison after serving 10 years for manslaughter. Emet is going on a date with Mercy, a PT specialist who also has her own dysfunctional family to deal with, namely her drugged out brother Clay. Everyday each of their patrons come in and each of them have a story to tell. What is truly great about this novel is the simplicity of each story carries within it the nuances of a much more complex situation. This is a testimony to the writer's talent in crafting something seemingly random into something totally cohesive. There are love stories, army stories, redemptive stories and stories that simply end bittersweetly and those that have a positive happily for now.

I found myself laughing at the lengths Clay was willing to go to get his way. I won't go into detail due to spoilers but that junkie had an imagination.Overall, I enjoyed the book.

He meets a girl (ahh) and asks her out and everything seems fine until her degenerate brother takes exception to the fact and decides to put an end to their relationship. Emet's boss is Eden Rose (nice name) and she gives sage counsel along the way and we get to hear some of her back story too. Although there are some very nice details in the book, short punchy descriptions, I felt like it could have been fleshed out more, we could have seen more of Emet and Mercey's relationship and gone for a whole bigger book - in short I felt like it needed more. However, it's well worth a read if you like a story filled with good interesting characters (and a dog), they're not sickly sweet, but real people each with their own flaws.

It has a neat cast of characters--each with their own special past (and baggage). I have to say I was unexpectedly charmed by Emet. I mean, he's got a prison record for something really, really bad. I didn't expect to like him. But I did. I do agree with another reviewer that I wish the book was a teeny bit longer, because I'd like for one or two things to be explored a bit more, but... it's also just lovely as it is. Anyway, since it's shorter, I think you could take it to the beach, read the whole thing (yum!), and still have time to dip your toes in the sea. Pretty darn nice. It left me smiling.

I\u2019ve found just the book for you.In her notes to the book, the author states that she had a number of stories wandering around in her mind, but couldn\u2019t get any of them to turn themselves into a novel. One day, however, she realised there was a way to put all these stories together \u2026 set it in a coffee shop where the individual stories would form a cohesive whole.The result is a charming novella with themes as divergent as redemption, revenge, the destructive nature of drugs, animal cruelty and love. Many of the characters are damaged, but they aren\u2019t throwing a pity party. Some have made great strides turning a bad past into a good future; others are taking those first baby steps. Emet First is on parole after spending nearly 10 years in prison, but his employer, Eden Rose, owner of the Serve You Right Caf\u00e9 could care less. Emet arrives at work on time, is honest, makes a great coffee, doesn\u2019t take days off and cooks excellent cakes, muffins and pastries. Eden knows why he was in prison, but she believes in second chances.Into Emet\u2019s life comes Mercedes Finch, Mercey to her friends. The product of a dysfunctional family, Mercey studied while supporting her mother and brother Clay. She succeeded academically and also changed the habits she learned from her mother. By watching the popular people, how they greeted each other, how they looked others in the eye, how they dressed, even how they pay compliments, she changed herself from a scowling, ill spoken scruff, into a charming young woman. Clay, on the other hand, believes everything that ever happened to him was caused not by his actions, but by the actions of others, a belief supported by his mother. When Clay steals his Mother\u2019s drugs, Mercey is blamed because she should have hidden the drugs where he couldn\u2019t find them. When Clay overhears Emet tell Mercey about his past, he works himself into a frenzy of self-pity and vows to destroy Emet.There is good character development in what is, essentially, a series of short stories, a mix of ingredients well blended into an entertaining book. The major characters are strongly drawn and they are well supported by quirky cameos. The dialogue between characters is authentic, sometimes witty, sometimes poignant, and always relevant.My ARC was provided by the publishers via NetGalley; it is a thoroughly enjoyable read.

He learned to bake in prison and his skills are certainly welcome to Eden who has her own demons to fight. When Emet meets physical therapist Mercey things seem to be looking up. But Mercey\u2019s junkie brother has other ideas and soon Emet will be forced to make a choice that could ruin his chances before they\u2019ve really begun. Lots of colourful characters pass through the caf\u00e9 and as we follow Emet\u2019s journey in this sadly-too-short novel. Jacobs relates a patchwork of tales, some that mesh with the major plot line and others that don\u2019t quite get there. All are interesting, however, and the style is warm and humorous with a twist of bittersweet. The prose is good, at times lyrical, especially the descriptions of weather and light. Despite its brevity, Jacobs makes us care about her main characters and I was a little disappointed when it ended, partially because I read an e-copy and didn\u2019t realise I was nearing the end (!), and partly because the story seemed to be building toward a bigger climax. The vignette backstories are great and had these been woven more completely into the larger plot this would have been a five star read. In her author notes Jacobs states the intention of the Serve You Right Caf\u00e9 was to act as a meeting point for a collection of stories she longed to tell and which needed a home. In that context the stories work beautifully; the Serve You Right Caf\u00e9 was a fitting home for all of them. Second Helpings at the Serve You Right Caf\u00e9 left me feeling uplifted, a little more informed about several issues, and wanting to know more about Emet and Eden. If you like your sweet treat with a little bite, definitely give this one a go. *Thanks to NetGalley and Linden Tree Press for the ARC"}, {"userName": "Jennifer McLean", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2032506-jennifer-mclean", "userReview": "Ok, let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVED \"Second Helpings At The Serve You Right Cafe\" by Tilia Klebenov Jacobs. Although it is a mystery, the atmosphere of the book is just so welcoming that it made me wish I lived in their neighborhood. I loved the feeling I got as the writer formed a picture in my mind of what the Serve You Right cafe looked and felt like. Jacobs' writing is so smooth that I found myself wishing I could walk into the cafe and order a comforting hazelnut mocha coffee. The novel centers around Serve You Right Cafe and the two main characters, Emet and Eden Rose, who run the joint. Emet is areformed ex-con who just wants to live a simple life. When he asks Mercey, a lovely but burdened lady out for dinner his simple life becomes much more complicated. Eden Rose, Emet's boss and owner of the cafe tries to help Emet because she has had her own troubles in the past. She encourages Emet to give his new relationship a chance even though Emet is sure Mercey will not forgive or understand his murky past. What Emet doesn't know is that Mercey has secrets of her own and those secrets might blow all chances for a relationship apart.As I said above, I loved this short read. \"Second Helpings At The Serve You Right Cafe\" is ilia Klebenov Jacobs second novel and I certainly hope she writes many more. I love that it's short enough to read in one day but the characters and situations are well fleshed out, leaving no gaps in the wonderful story. This book is easily a five out of five star read and perfect for the upcoming summer. If you have a cozy little cafe somewhere in your town, grab this book and go order yourself a good cuppa and a treat, you deserve a lovely little break and this book certainly won't disappoint."}], "description": "What if the world didn\u2019t want you to go straight?
