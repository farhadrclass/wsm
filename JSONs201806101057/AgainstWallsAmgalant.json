Hammond does not give much of a biography except to say she lives a dull life to concentrate on her fiction. She lives in Australia this is the first of her two published books in the trilogy.This is not a book to take lightly or to expect a quick weekend read from it. Don\u2019t let the size of the book scare you off either. Years ago I was handed a copy of Gary Jennings\u2019 Aztec to read by another Marine. My first thought was \u201cYou have to be kidding, this book is huge.\u201d I was told I would like it. It wasn\u2019t a fast read, but it definitely held my interest and there was definitely a learning curve with the book. I went on to read all of Jenning\u2019s books at the time. In fact most of the cultural details I know of the Mongols came from Jennings\u2019 Marco Polo novel The Journeyer. Amgalant will take your full attention. The character names are unfamiliar as is the setting. It will put most readers in a place they rarely can go. For me it was like reading a history crossed with the Rig-Veda-Sanhita. It is almost magical.Hammond bases her work of the the relatively short Secret History of the Mongols. The Secret History>Although nearly everyone know the name Genghis Khan, few can give many details about the man or his people. Hammond goes into detail about the Mongols and their neighbors. Although a work of fiction, many details, the setting, and events are all historical. Early on the reader will get introduced to the ways of the mongols. A society where stealing a horse was more serious of a crime than murder. They are a people with a strict set of rules for themselves. They face the Turks, Chinese, Tartars, barbarians, and internal conflict. Nothing will be easy.The reading also is not easy. It takes some time and effort on the readers part because t he story is complex and the writing is detailed. It is intended to capture the author\u2019s passion for her subject. Hammond has plenty of passion and it shows in her work. Amgalant was difficult to start, but the payoff for sticking with it is immense. Amgalant far exceeds any of the historical fiction I have read in detail and effort. his is a book that is meant to be read slowly and carefully so the the reader can absorb the wealth of information contained in the pages. Amgalant belongs on the shelf with the best of the epic historical fictions.Book Review by Joseph Spuckler"}, {"userName": "Libbie Hawker (L.M. Ironside)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6834667-libbie-hawker-l-m-ironside", "userReview": "This large and finely crafted novel is the first in a trilogy which seeks to bring The Secret History of the Mongols, the oldest surviving Mongolian written work, to life. The Secret History is part historical record, part fanciful myth, and all Genghis Khan \u2013 or Tchingis Khan, as he is more properly called, and Temujin more properly still, for that was the name of the real man who rose to legendary greatness on the Mongolian steppes.The Old Ideal begins with a groundwork in Mongolian myth and religion, then builds to a family history of Temujin, and finally Temujin himself arrives on the scene, a baby born in the midst of war, on the day his father dies. Temujin grows up amid war \u2013 not only the war that took his father\u2019s life, but also a war among his half-brothers. From early in his life, the reader can sense that this boy is more than a boy \u2013 he has an air of destiny, and courage that few possess. The novel tracks Temujin through his early adulthood and ends with his assumption of the title Khan. Further exploits \u2013 including much defeating of other clans \u2013 are promised in the next installment, appropriately subtitled \u201cTribal Brawls.\u201d And, the reader assumes, the feat for which Tchingis Khan was best known, uniting the Mongolian tribes into one great empire, will surely follow in the trilogy\u2019s final installment.What\u2019s extraordinary about this novel is the way the narrative feels both modern, as if the story is being related by your history-buff friend from 2012, and perfectly historical, as though your friend is also a time-traveler from some era around the middle of the thirteenth century. Bryn Hammond has accomplished a feat seldom seen in literature: Retaining the very distinctive character of her historical source material while injecting it with her own narrative voice; and this feat is all the more remarkable when you consider that this is a long book. My Kindle shows over 12,000 \u201clocations\u201d in the text, which converts to roughly 580 pages of printed text. The enchanting quality of the voice stays consistent throughout.In part, Hammond has made The Secret History her own by weaving in bits of poetry and prose from other native literary sources who wrote extensively and rapturously on the subject of heroes. According to her author\u2019s notes, Hammond entwined the hero-poetry of the Old English (including but not limited to Beowulf \u2013 Aha! I thought that passage was familiar!), the Germanic tribes, and even the Inuit. The result is a hero story that feels at once specific to Tchingis Khan and universal to all heroes everywhere; and the text itself takes on the flavor and rhythm of ancient poetry.And there\u2019s the rub. Hammond has been so faithful to her source material that a modern reader may find herself stumbling frequently. It is often necessary to stop and \u201cunpack\u201d the meaning of a sentence or a passage, in the same way that a modern reader new to Old English writing must ponder over Beowulf. Often I found myself a bit dazed by the sudden mention of an unknown character or event, only to have that character or event explained in full later in the chapter. The result was feeling as if I\u2019d walked in on a conversation I was never meant to be a part of, and had to \u201ccatch up\u201d later on. A bit less faithfulness to the original material could have provided a more accessible reading experience and a tighter flow of plot \u2013 but my wish for a slightly more modern reading experience doesn\u2019t lessen my admiration for what Bryn Hammond has achieved in her near-flawless marriage of historical poetry and modern storytelling. Perhaps a good compromise for future editions would be the inclusion of front material alerting the reader to the existence of the extensive glossary at the end of the book. I didn't realize it was there until I'd finished reading on my Kindle!Thanks to the author\u2019s extensive research and her obvious love for the setting and characters, Amgalant is rich with historical detail. The smallest parts of life on the Mongolian steppe are clearly illustrated \u2013 household gods (and how to properly worship them), clothing, what constitutes richness versus poverty, and so much more. Yet the novel never feels like a \u201cfashion show,\u201d as so many historical novels do, nor are these details delivered in the dreaded \u201cinfo dump.\u201d Hammond has pieced together an education in Mongolian culture, an admiration for epic hero poetry, and the fascinating stories of real people using practically invisible stitches.While we are on the subject of real people, the richness and depth of character in this novel is as remarkable as the rest. Amgalant: The Old Ideal has a good many characters \u2013 I hesitate to declare that there are as many as in your average George R. R. Martin novel, but surely the count comes close. But as much care has been given to the individuality of each and every one as has been given to the individuality of Temujin himself. Often characters are witty, too, so that this novel provided me with several laugh-out-loud moments as I read the snappy exchanges between all these well-drawn characters.Amgalant is an impressive achievement. Mongolian culture is rarely explored in historical fiction, and Tchingis Khan is usually depicted in few dimensions \u2013 that is, as a big scary barbarian conqueror, not as a real man with a real history. Amgalant\u2019s first volume shows much promise that, when the trilogy is concluded, the world of historical fiction will be able to enjoy the history of the Mongols from a different, truer, more satisfying perspective. I look forward to the next book."}, {"userName": "John Caviglia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10326280-john-caviglia", "userReview": "Amgalant One: The Old Ideal takes the beginning of the slim volume that is The Secret History of the Mongols (which, in the edition I found at Amazon, has fewer than 200 pages of verse) and enlarges it to create a compulsively readable, immersive world. And as this work\u2014roughly six hundred pages in itself--begins an audacious trilogy intended to expand the whole of The Secret History, the prospective reader might ask why, and how, Hammond has so amplified the spare original\u2026.As to the why, it\u2019s clear that she is herself enraptured by the time, the place \u2026 and above all the historic characters she fleshes out to live their complex tribal lives. Hammond has researched every aspect of her enterprise, not to harass us with needless historic detail, but to make sure that the experience of the reader will be full and genuine. This is your chance to travel in space and time, and BE THERE, as the Temujin of the text--one day to be known as Genghis Khan--is fashioned into what was prophesied at his birth, when he was born with a blood clot in his fist. You learn what the Mongols eat (a lot of sheep, it seems) and drink (black milk!). You discover many other things about their tribal culture. But essentially, the novel takes you into the minds of the protagonists as the Secret History plays itself out\u2026. Seeing as Mongols saw each other, and the world (I got a new take on ancient China, and the wall intended to keep barbarians out), is where much of the action takes place. Interior conflicts\u2026. Interior/exterior conflicts\u2026. Interior monologues\u2026. Interior dialogues \u2026 trialogues\u2026? Tribal conferences. Alliances with Tartars? War? What to do? Questions are at the heart of this version of the Mongol enterprise, when the future of much of the world could hinge on a shaman\u2019s reading of the cracks in a sheep\u2019s scapula. The rise of Genghis Khan might have been prophesied, but in this novel it was a supremely complicated thing to those who lived the beginnings of the largest empire known to man in tents.As for the novel\u2019s actual prose, there\u2019s an aspect that at first was hard for me to get a handle on\u2026. Hammond is totally (gleefully!) anachronistic, both in authorial commentary and in the speech and thought of her characters, so that the 13th century is displayed through contemporary, sometimes slangy, language. Ta! If you are bothered by anachronism, you will be bothered. As for me, once I adjusted, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride, for Hammond\u2019s writing is rich, nuanced, humorous. Also, since there is no record of how her protagonists actually spoke, by simply abdicating from the attempt to \u201ctranslate\u201d their tribal language(s), she avoids the clunky linguistic contrivances of novelists that attempt to fake ancient and foreign, never written speech\u2026. And I loved the strength and wisdom of the women in this novel, which surprised me, given a society in which they could be one of the spoils of battle.In sum, Amgalant is a rare and different, wonderful read, although not always easy. Hats off to Hammond for her long, loving and continuing discipline. I look forward to reading the next volume."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10716214-margaret", "userReview": "What to say about this book? Covering \"Genghis\" Khan's life from birth to his election as Khan, this wonderful omnibus is a delight to read.Bryn Hammond makes the Mongol peoples spring to life as you read about them. Dry witted, whimsical, a thorough delight from page to page.The sort of book not to read on public transport as you are liable to become so engrossed in it that you will miss your stop.I highly recommend it to people who are interested in Genghis Khan, history of the steppes, and anyone who wants a roaring good read."}, {"userName": "Gary Inbinder", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5963850-gary-inbinder", "userReview": "This is a very well-written and engrossing re-telling of an ancient text, The Secret History of the Mongols, the story of Temujin (Genghis Kahn) and his family. I'll admit I know little of this history beyond what I recall from an old film starring Omar Sharif and Stephen Boyd. Nevertheless, I don't think you need to know the specific history to appreciate this compelling novel.Three things impressed me most: Hammond's ability to create believable characters in everyday situations; her use of \"modern\" language suitable to these characters that works much better than contrived archaisms;the interchange among civilizations and nomadic peoples and the effect these relationships have had within history. In that regard, we live in history, we are all the product of those who came before us.All in all, this novel is a significant achievement."}, {"userName": "Julie Bozza", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4508080-julie-bozza", "userReview": "I've just finished a re-read of this, and I loved it even more than I remembered. Definitely (the first volume of) my Favourite Book Ever, and I suspect always will be. Such marvellous humour, brilliant writing, fascinating characters and wonderful setting. It doesn't get better than that.###This is more a celebration than a review, for the author is my sister and Amgalant is My Favourite Book Ever. Bryn knows that I wouldn't say that if I didn't mean it in the simplest and most straightforward of ways, and the rest of you will of course make up your own minds one way or the other. But I love this book, and the second volume as well (which will be available soon), and I am eagerly anticipating the third (which has yet to be written).Amgalant is a retelling of The Secret History of the Mongols, the story of the man we know today as Genghis Khan, but whom we meet as the lad Temujin. It is set, of course, some centuries ago in a country and among a people with whom most of us aren't familiar. And it brings the whole to such vivid life, it's as if it's all happening right here and now to us.Before we meet Temujin, we meet his parents, the chivalrous Yesugei and the marvellous Hoelun. From what should have been inauspicious beginnings - he is moved to kidnap her - they come to love each other, and from that very first chapter I was in love with them, too. As I was with the novel. Bryn retells the story in ways so evocative, so full of human motivation, and always with such respect for human dignity, that we are moved to understand things that our modern world no longer condones. In this she reminds me of Patrick O'Brian and his skills in recreating ways of thinking that are in the past and rather foreign to us now - evoking them in such vividness and with such respect for all involved that we become involved, too.Bryn recreates a whole world here, with its varied peoples and customs, beliefs and mores. It is large and vivid and whole. As detailed and as solid as today. In this she reminds me of Tolkien and his creation of an epic Middle-earth. The narrative is pungent with truth and ayrag.(I found myself salivating to drink ayrag, by the way, even while I wondered how anyone even could. I mean, whose idea was it to first try fermented mare's milk\u2026? How desperate could they have been? But the characters love it, and now I can't help but love it, too. From a respectful distance.)And by no means is this novel all serious business! There is plenty of awesome humour, of the clever, quiet, wry, character-driven sort. The book had me laughing and chortling and burbling along, sometimes all at once.Meanwhile, the story tells us about both whole peoples and the individuals who create history through their lives, their choices, their loves, their heartaches. There are Arthurian echoes, of a leader seeking to unite fractious tribes against a common enemy, endeavouring to create justice based on right rather than might, trying to deal well with both the big picture and the personal, and all the while searching for his definitive hat.I'd love for you to give Amgalant a try! You can sample up to half of it for free on Smashwords. You might not care for Temujin and his story after all, of course - but there's also a very real chance you might come to love him like I do."}, {"userName": "Ron Fritsch", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4468051-ron-fritsch", "userReview": "Amgalant One: The Old Ideal is the first novel in Bryn Hammond\u2019s historical fiction trilogy set in northeast Asia in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Hammond\u2019s protagonist is the person we know as Genghis Khan.One of the many delights I encountered in this novel was that it\u2019s written from the point of view of the Mongols. We speak of the Great Wall of China as if it were a single smartly executed defensive structure built by the civilized Chinese to keep out their \u201cbarbarian\u201d neighbors to the north. Maps of the \u201cGreat Wall\u201d reveal that it\u2019s actually a number of mostly parallel east-to-west walls. The Mongols and their allies viewed these walls as offensive movements by the Chinese to bring more and more \u201cbarbarian\u201d territory into China.Thus: \u201cthese ghastly dead gigantic insects that crept across the steppe. . . . These ugly mean-spirited possessions of our mother earth, these worms, these anti-liberty flags and wind-blown banners to imprisonment, these thistles in the grass, these lines of poison. A nomad can do poetry, on walls. The Wall is what we hate. Civilization is what has done us wrong.\u201dAnother joy for me is Hammond\u2019s unique style, which isn\u2019t meant for quick reading but for reading and contemplation. Here are some tidbits:\u201c\u2018Too stupid for battle. Is that a sort of oxymoron?\u2019 His uncle the khan fixed an eye on him. \u2018An oxymoron\u2019s the other thing.\u2019\u201d\u201cAt the worst news in the Mongols\u2019 history, she wept for joy.\u201d (She\u2019d also learned that the man she loved had survived a disastrous war fought against both the Tartars and Chinese.)\u201cSurvivors, for their punishment, have the worst sight.\u201d\u201cEven a suspect action can have a nice consequence.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a funny trick with knowledge of the future: you\u2019re not meant to act and twist things up. You\u2019re almost meant to know and then forget\u2014go on as if you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cThe world\u2019s early kings were sacred kings and had to be. Religious awe: tried-and-true to subjugate minds and overthrow the insistent, rowdy equality of tribes. In general, religion is found hand-in-glove with despots.\u201dAnd I\u2019m so glad to see these \u201cuncivilized\u201d Mongol \u201cbarbarians\u201d portrayed as people whose humanity and intelligence equal, when they don\u2019t exceed, our own.The son of a chieftain and his brothers abduct the bride of a member of another clan. They\u2019re pleased when the groom makes no futile attempt to fight them off. They didn\u2019t want to harm or kill him. The bride, who\u2019d invited her abduction by staring approvingly at her abductor, wastes no time deciding she\u2019d rather have him for a husband than the man she\u2019d been promised to.The new couple\u2019s first child, born on the worst day of that disastrous war, is Genghis Khan.This is the kind of historical fiction I love.

I'd have read it with pleasure just for the subject matter or the gorgeous writing; but Hammond goes far beyond the life of Genghis Khan. This book does what the very best historical fiction hopes for: re-create a world, in all its glorious detail. From the distaste and horror of eating anything beyond meat and milk, to the complicated ties between brothers and half-brothers, Amgalant brings to life a complex, remote society with no anachronisms and amazing immediacy.
