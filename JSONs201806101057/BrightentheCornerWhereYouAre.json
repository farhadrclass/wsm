Joe Robert teaches. Teaching is something he is forced to do because he needs the money, but it is also something he's good at. Fred Chappell's book is about a single day during which this storytelling prankster's event filled life pushes him into situations where his humor, imagination, and capacity to think makes the lives of the people around him better. At the same time Brighten The Corner Where You Are takes on deeper issues about the responsibilities of educators.The book starts out with a prologue about Joe Robert and his son walking in the early morning toward their barn to feed and milk their cows. It's not dark, because the moon is huge. In fact the moon is so big that it is overbearing. So Joe Robert takes it down and places it in one of the steel containers he has for the milk. Joe's son, who is also the story's narrator, is horrified by this action and convinces his father to put the moon back where it belongs. This first part of the novel is what I would call magical realism, while what happens after that is more along the lines of exaggerated story telling. But whatever label is used, the writing is beautiful and works on multiple levels.On the surface the story is about a teacher who knows he will have to face the school board that day, because he's been accused of teaching something improper. He's nervous about his upcoming trial and wants to make a good impression, but events keep tumbling his way that bruise his body and dirty his clothing. Still, he keeps moving forward through his day.One of the most interesting aspects of the book is the way it covers the Creationism vs. Darwinism argument. Kirkman seems to be saying that the actual argument is not whether people were created by God in the exact form they are in today or descended from another type of primate. The real argument is can people have the complete truth revealed to them or do they need to constantly search for truth, getting closer and closer to the goal but never quite reaching it. There are also multiple incidents in the book that make Joe Robert question what he does for a living. One of those incidents makes him wonder if the desire for knowledge is the cause of pain, while others argue against that simplistic answer. Brighten The Corner Where You Are is perfect for readers who like books that are fun to read, but still cover complex issues.Steve Lindahl - Author of Motherless Soul"}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1892712-krista", "userReview": "This book was bizarre -- in a good way. It felt like Where the Red Fern grows meets the Scopes Monkey trial told by Richard Bach in a stream of consciousness journal entry. The story was a fun read - it all takes place in one very long and odd day for a nutty high school teacher. There were a couple of sections that I still don't really understand, and I could have done away with the last two pages, which were a bit of a hammer over the head in case I didn't get the point, but all in all, I'm glad I read it and won't soon forget it."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4183997-karen", "userReview": "I like this author's writing.

It is full of wisecracking one-liners, profound truths, unusual words that have been pleading to be spoken and scenes that, I think, will remain in my memory for a long time. Without a doubt the best debate on evolutionary theory I've ever heard takes place between the \"hero\" of the book, the author's father, Joe Robert, who teaches high school to students he wants to \"keep up with modern thought\" and be well-informed so that they can \"understand the world they live in\", and the student who appoints himself \"Socrates\". The hero of a novel doesn't usually let himself be twisted and spiraled into such statements as, \"Socrates, if you don't shut up, I'm going to give you a fat lip and a black eye and a bloody nose. Stuff that in your dialectic and smoke it.\" let alone into an admission that he loved Socrates until he met him personally. Witty and fun and insightful, this is a book I recommend to... everyone."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Castro", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43363595-elizabeth-castro", "userReview": "Initially, the title, \"Brighten the Corner Where You Are,\" attracted my attention. After all, this is one of my daily goals, to bring compassion and warmth to those around me, friends, family, and strangers. At first, I felt like I was duped into reading this book. The paragraphs stretched on forever- eight or ten sentences, sometimes saying what could be said in one sentence. Once I got over that, I began to relax and settle into the story.The real gem of the story is Joe Robert Kirkman, does brighten the corners where he is, just not in the traditional sense. Joe is a passionate schoolteacher, (who claims he doesn't want the job) and will stop at nothing to get his student's attention whether it be ridiculous pranks, creating dialogue with goats, or pretending to be controversial historical figures that he knows will bring unwanted attention to his teaching methods.My parents were school teachers, and this book brought back memories, and had me laughing out loud. No, \"Brighten the Corner Where You Are,\" is not a self help book, but it could be in the sense that getting out of your head and viewing the world as a fascinating place, awaiting your discovery could be helpful. I recommend this book as a gift for science teachers especially (because the main character holds a deep reverence and fondness for science) or anyone who likes to read about country life."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1075533-emily", "userReview": "Despite the title of this book sounding like some sort of self-help, it is not. This book defies description. But would you ever think an account of milking a cow could be poetic? Me either. \u201cNudging head and shoulder into the comforting flanks, washing the teats and squeezing them gently at first in case of soreness and gradually building into rhythm, stream after straight stream as regular as the stately heart of the animal, bright jets of milk Xing to fill the pail with warm lace, with delicate foam that touched his knuckles like a spiderweb. These days, these hours, were of life the cream supreme...\u201d Much of it is like this, telling of the ordinary in extraordinary detail without being effusive or corny. And telling of major events your average joe would go on and on about in a matter of fact way. It\u2019s day in the life, it\u2019s tall tale, it\u2019s folk tale and mystical realism. It\u2019s painterly art and sturdy sculpture, it\u2019s the fantastic made real and the ridiculous put out in the light. It\u2019s a weird weird book, there\u2019s no getting around that.

To me the plot of this book wasn't as interesting as just reading and absorbing the language. It reminds me of George Clooney and John Goodman having a conversation in Oh Brother Where Art Though. You don't exactly know what's going on in places but the flow and the cadence of the language keeps you interested. From the back of the book: \"This story of a day in the life of Joe Robert Kirkman, a NC mountain schoolteacher, sly prankster, country philosopher, and family man...\" Joe Robert is in trouble with the school board who've called a meeting after school to get to the bottom of what he's been teaching in his science class. The problem is that Joe Robert has several misadventures causing the reader to wonder what shape he'll be in if/when he makes it to the meeting. \"He pretended that in these moments of leisure he was planning the day to come, and so he was. He arranged it all in his head in sensible order and then forgot it all as soon as he rose from the chair.\"\"He had eaten all of his cooking he could endure, and he had escaped with his life.\" \"Oh no.\" Billy Joe cried. \"Now it's up on the roof! We'll never get it down from there. Oh no.\" Easy to tell from his tone of voice that the sight of God in all His glory among the cherubim and seraphim would not equal the sight of this goat on the schoolhouse roof. The life of Billy Joe Pressman had reached its natural climax in his sophomore year of high school and from here on out would be all downhill. Disappointed with his later colorless years, he would, my father surmised, wind up a dope fiend or a literary critic.\"\"I've just engaged in a short telephone conversation with my old buddy Virgil Campbell,\" he said. \"And I feel like I've plowed a half-acre of new ground.\""}, {"userName": "Catsalive", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1145499-catsalive", "userReview": "Jess tells the story of his father's last day as a high-school teacher in Tipton, NC, in 1946.Joe Robert Kirkman - sly prankster, country philosopher, farmer, dreamer and family man - has run afoul of the school board due to his even-handed approach to the theory of evolution. He's not at his best when he has to face the board as he's had such a bizarrely eventful day: a close encounter with a bobcat in a tree; rescuing a child from drowning; accepting a tribute from the parents of a suicide; coping creatively with the touchy subject of evolution in his general science class; discovering the humanity of the black janitor; coaxing a goat from a roof; and losing a Socratic argument to the shyest student in his world history class.It was a little too down-homey for me, but the stories are told with wry, gentle humour, and will probably remind you of your grandfather, or some other oldster, familial or otherwise.Rated 6/10 at http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/1...."}, {"userName": "Misha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175912-misha", "userReview": "I love the title of this novel and I bought a copy years ago for the title alone. I have been cleaning off my bookshelves, deciding what to keep and sell (a friend of mine is totally appalled that I could sell any of my books, but given that I live in 700 square feet that will soon be crammed with all things baby, I just have to!), and found this again.

It\u2019s one day in the life of this sly, inventive man\u2014a day of much mischief and surprises, and a school board meeting in which his teaching of Darwin in science class will be called into question.

This is a wonderful little book. It's written by someone who grew up in my area (always a bonus for me) and the setting is my area, so I can really relate to the characters. It's about a day in the life of a local school teacher, and does he have one heck of a day! Parts of the book had me laughing out loud! Don't let the title fool you--it sounds like something bright, cheery, and cheesy. I would say that the title refers more to the idea that we should each be ourselves, no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in. It may also refer to sort of shining a light on ignorance.

Why he was climbing a medium-sized intricate poplar tree.\"Brighten the Corner Where You Are is the sequel to a book I read a decade ago, I Am One of You Forever. I'm a fan of much Southern writing, and Fred Chappell exudes a real North Carolina charm. Maybe a tad much of it. The story, narrated by Jess, is about his father Joe Robert Kirkman, and covers one exceedingly eventful day in Kirkman's life. Hunting mishaps, rescues, and misadventures at the high school (in the basement, on the rood and in the classroom) make up the bulk of the story, though that overly simplifies the novel's considerable thoughtfulness, gentle humor, and graceful use of language. This was a quick read, not as gritty as, say, anything by Homer Hickam, but quite enjoyable nevertheless."}, {"userName": "Robbie Forkish", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14843399-robbie-forkish", "userReview": "I rarely read books more than once. This is my third reading of Brighten the Corner Where You Are. This book is more or less my literary equivalent of comfort food: warm, lightly spiced, and very satisfying. My favorite chapter, \"General Science\", is set in a classroom. The class is described as 'a murky broth of General seasoned with a light but noticeable sauce of Science.' The topic: the theory of evolution. The setting: western North Carolina in 1946. The narrator's grandmother's view that knowledge and wisdom are two separate things entirely and not even closely connected is demonstrated in a memorable and humorous fashion. The schoolteacher-protagonist, Joe Robert Kirkman (who also appears in other Chappell books) is a renaissance man trying to make sense of the mid 20th century.
