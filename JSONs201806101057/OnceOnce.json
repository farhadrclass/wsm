If memory serves me right, it was called, simply, \"Once...\"The basis of the game was to create a story from a card prompt and people had to guess whether it was true or not - or something like that anyway.As many things do, at first this game went over my head a bit. *swoosh* Because in my everyday life, whenever I would try to make up a story (or more accurately - what you might call a white lie) to my friends or family, they always seemed to know right away. At least my mom, who I had convinced myself was secretly a CIA agent, always knew.But I eventually figured out that when it is turned into a game, this \"storytelling\" phenomenon can actually be quite fun, because apparently if you are being upfront about this thing called \"fiction\" being \"not real\", then it is perfectly acceptable and not something you have to be nervous about. Around that time, I started to get very good at it.So anyway, I played this game with my friends, and at one point, I told a gruesome story about how, just the previous week, I had seen a cat torture and kill a baby bird, basically skinning it alive. A fairly traumatic thing for a young girl to witness. Of course, everyone assumed that I had actually seen it happen, because what kid could just make something like that up? Well apparently, a kid with a sick mind. I had made it up.With an incredibly active and visual imagination, not to mention, a little bit of craziness thrown in for good measure, I had actually seen this scene happen solely in my mind's eye. So, I didn't technically just make up the story on the fly; rather, as a result seeing a smushed dead baby bird lying on the street, my mind went on to imagine how this might have happened. Thus, I received the previously stated disturbing mental image.I am about 99.98646362728% certain that most people's minds don't work this way. I think maybe you need to be at least a little bit of a paranoid schizophrenic to be a storyteller. At least, that's how I explain my strange mental processes to myself.________________________________This book, entitled Once, is about a young Jewish boy, named Felix, living and suffering through the horrid times of the Holocaust. He has been hidden away in an orphanage and has convinced himself that his parents are still around and just waiting for the right moment to come and get him. When they don't show up after three years, Felix sets out to find them and meets new friends and new trouble.The little boy loves to tell stories and does so throughout almost the entire book. He isn't what you might think of as an \"unreliable narrator\", however. He is always upfront with the reader, so though he may tell \"stories\" to the other characters, he never does with us. A true unreliable narrator is more like what you would find in the Fight Club, where the reader isn't given all the necessary information and much is withheld.The things that happen to and around Felix in this book are terrifyingly unbelievable. It is easy to tell yourself that things like this could never happen. But they have. They are. They will.The prose is simple and heart-wrenching. The writing is in no way strenuous, but the story is. Worry and heartache will easily overcome you in this book. It should be difficult to believe that human beings are capable of such atrocities but somehow, it isn't that difficult to imagine.We should be able to look at a book like this and say \"No one would ever be capable of doing that.\" But we can't.Overall, this was an excellent story about a young boy suffering through a horrible time in history. It certainly pulls at your heart strings, but I wouldn't quite call it life changing. This book comes off more like a deeply and darkly intense fable.The books is a short 163 pages, and the final chapter leaves it somewhat open-ended. Just enough so, that it you leaves you asking questions but still gives you a bit of closure. Happy-endings are not readily available within Holocaust fiction, unfortunately.This is kind of book that resonates. It stays with you and keeps your mind working long after you have finished.If you are interested, the hardcover is currently the cheapest way to obtain this book at just under 7 dollars on Amazon. The Kindle edition is very pricey at 10 dollars, especially for such a short book.The thing I loved most about this book is that throughout most of it, Felix has an uplifting and optimistic personality. It was so entertaining as well as endearing to hear his thoughts and views on the world. He is an amazing character and a new favorite of mine. His viewpoint reminded me ever so slightly of the main character in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, in the way that he notices things and sees things in a manner that most would not.At one point in the book, Felix sees Nazis burning Jewish books, so he becomes convinced that the Nazis are doing all of this because the Nazis hate the Jews' books and not just them. So in order to make sense of it all, he tells himself a story about how in a book warehouse in another country, one day a bunch of Jewish books fell on top of someone's kids and crushed them. So these people vowed to take revenge on the books and anyone who owns them.It is truly remarkable the creations that a mind can invent to explain that which it does not know.__________________________________On another note, I have searched high and low on the Internet for another edition of the \"Once...\" game that I played as a kid and have been entirely unsucessful in finding it.I'm beginning to think that maybe my CIA agent mother had a single copy designed and produced in order to help cultivate my imagination. See, now that doesn't sound at ALL unreasonable to me. But that's just how I roll..."}, {"userName": "Marjorie Ingall", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1249329-marjorie-ingall", "userReview": "I did not want to like Once. I hated that cover line: \u201cEverybody deserves to have something good in their life. At least once.\u201d Damn it, \u201canyone\u201d does not agree with \u201ctheir\u201d! Even if I am the last person fighting this battle I will continue to fight it! GAH! But um, more importantly, Once sounded to me like a rehash of The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, a book I loathed. Children (and adults) do not need faux-naif, manipulative, emotionally inauthentic Holocaust books. I\u2019d thought Once was about an equally clueless protagonist. I was wrong. Felix, a Jewish boy in Poland in 1942, isn\u2019t an idiot. He\u2019s in denial. There's a difference. And as the book goes on and the horrors mount, Felix\u2019s denial evaporates. Storytelling has been his shield and survival strategy. As he loses that ability to tell himself truth-deflecting stories, you feel sick. The pacing of this book is incredible \u2013 Gleitzman is known in his native Australia for writing funny, goofy contemporary children\u2019s books \u2013 and the book\u2019s short paragraphs and use of humor (no, really) will make it super-enticing to boys and non-book-lovers. But be forewarned, the Nazis\u2019 brutality is explicit and disgusting; this should not be any child\u2019s first Holocaust novel. (Start with Number the Stars instead.) Once, which is influenced by the story of Janusz Korczak, offers no false hope."}, {"userName": "Sally906", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4949011-sally906", "userReview": "What a wonderful story - Felix is a young Jewish boy in WWII Poland sets off from an orphanage to find his missing parents.

Having glanced at some reviews I thought I would look at it first to see if it were suitable for an 11 yr old. When I had read a few lines I continued to read the whole book as it was such a compelling story. It was very harrowing and it would not be suitable for younger or sensitive readers. This story about an orphanage during world war 2 has a wonderful main character. Felix is Jewish and living in an orphanage, he runs away to find his parents, he refuses to accept they might not be alive. He invents stories which keep the horrible reality of what's happening around them at arms length. He is wonderfully optimistic and has a lovely personality. I found him very engaging and funny. A really well written book, very sad but also it feels like there is hope for Felix, and if anyone can escape or survive it will be him.

The story focuses on Felix, a small 10 year old Jewish boy, who is living in an orphanage. His parents put him in this place a little over three years ago for safety. So he isn't exactly an orphan. Felix is very naive and believes the Nazi's are burning books because they don't like books and sets off to find his parents and save all the books in his parents book store. I was a bit shocked initially how naive he is but children were quite different long time ago compared to today. Felix doesn't stay too naive for long after the horrors he endures and witnesses. Its heartbreaking to see Felix realize what is going on around him and what the Nazis are really after.It's not an easy read in terms of the subject matter. However, the author does a great job capturing the story for young children. It is a very short book but the first in a series of following Felix and his friends. I plan to read the remaining in the series, but taking a break in between for a bit of light reading."}, {"userName": "Siobhan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13213279-siobhan", "userReview": "I remember reading this book as a child still in primary school. It was a project and I was the only child in the class who fully understood what the child in the story was talking about. The burning books, the angry men in uniforms, the train, the carriages, the fear... What he was experiencing. No one else knew what it was that was so scary and terrifying about this story, except me. I guess that makes it worse in the long run.I think that's why this story has stuck with me into my adulthood. I remember sitting in the library and our classroom and our teacher would read to us, or we would read aloud to each other. I remember it so vividly and sometimes I believe I can go back to that place, in that beanbag or chair and just relive those stories with my teachers because they didn't shy away from the confronting issues. Together, though we were children, we faced them head on.That's why this books was one of my favourites. The sheer scale and the terror, but also the hope.

The narrator, Felix, is a young Jewish boy who has been living in an orphanage in 1942 Poland, where his parents left him and from which he expects them to fetch him some day. What makes this such a chilling and hard-to-put-down book is Felix's naive and innocent view of the horrific events around him. It reminded me of John Boyne's The Boy in the Striped Pajamas in that respect. As the reader, I understood the true significance of events he was seeing and misinterpreting, and at every chapter I kept expecting his naivete to get him killed or captured by the Nazis. Fortunately, Felix slowly begins to understand the true nature of events around him, yet he continues to cling to the idea that his parents are alive. This book had me literally tense with suspense. I wanted to put it down to relieve the tension, but I just had to read on. The story ended abruptly, begging for the sequel I know has been written and which I absolutely must read. This is a truly scary story, not for the faint of heart.

It\u2019s told from the point of view of a 9-10 year old Jewish boy, a storyteller, who\u2019s caught up in the Holocaust. This story is powerful, compelling, and so very sad, yet somehow uplifting too, and even amusing every once in a while. I\u2019ll be thinking quite a bit about Felix, Zelda, Barney, and some other characters. Felix is a fine narrator and everyone and everything come across very vividly. The author\u2019s note at the end is wonderful. My favorite line in it is \u201cThis story is my imagination trying to grasp the unimaginable.\u201d I\u2019m off to check out his website: www.morrisgleitzman.com. This book is book 1 of a trilogy and I\u2019ve already reserved book 2 at the library. This book is in the children\u2019s section of my library, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s best for older children, teens, and adults because it doesn\u2019t at all shy away from the atrocities, and even though Felix starts off innocent and ignorant, he\u2019s certainly not able to stay that way. There is one twist in the plot about one of the characters that I didn\u2019t see coming, and that I thought was brilliant to include. Highly recommended, but not for kids who don\u2019t already know about the Holocaust."}, {"userName": "Cameron Cross", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54086704-cameron-cross", "userReview": "Rating this book was extremely difficult as it was tricky to detach my views on the writing itself from the topic being written about. Ultimately five stars felt fair as the story was expertly (as most Morris G stories are) told with all of the due respect and clarity it deserves and if that was not enough, introducing me to the realities of that era was. The first book in the Felix and Zelda series is extremely short and normally that would be a deterrent for me, but the intensity of the events in this story (considering it is quite fast paced) does facilitate the need for it to be kept short. It was emotionally draining for the most part.One thing I noticed that was done very well was that most stories with a small child as the protagonist will still seem as though they are being told by an adult, but Once perfectly captures what experiencing the events of WW2 through a child eyes would be like (I can only imagine). Felix is consistently naive and while that did frustrate me at times, it felt completely genuine and culminated in more emotional scenes. In conclusion this book was jarringly and shatteringly sobering as to events that really did take place during the time of Nazi occupation. This book left me with a melancholy that no other book (no matter how sad) has managed, simply because although this was fictional in some aspects, it was also very real with no exaggeration. Things that happened in this story really happened and as I read, it hit me in a way it never has before. I've always known this stuff happened, but Once really drove it home. It breaks my heart but I am more than thankful for the experience, I WILL be continuing but maybe after a light hearted read first hahaha.Sorry to ramble."}, {"userName": "Libros Prestados", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36773851-libros-prestados", "userReview": "Hay libros con los que empiezas con mal pie.

At least Once.Once is the heartbreaking, harrowing but ultimately hope-filled story of Felix, a ten year old Polish Jewish boy living through the Nazi occupation of Poland and the Holocaust. He lives in an orphanage in the Polish mountains - his parents, who are booksellers, left him there when they went off to solve all sorts of book-related emergencies (according to Felix).Life in the orphanage sounds pretty sad and desperate - the conditions are pretty basic, there's notmuch food and thenunsare pretty strict - but very gradually you learn the truth - that the nuns doing all they can to keep the Nazis away from the orphanage so keep the children (including a number of Jewish children) safe.Gradually, Felix comes to realise the truth about the Holocaust and the Nazis and what is happening to the Jews in Poland (spoiler alert: nothing nice). We're shown some of the atrocities of the Holocaust through the eyes of a ten year old child which somehow makes them all the more horrifying.One of the most heartbreaking things I found about the story (apart from the whole Holocaust thing, which obviously gets top spot) is the way Felix makes up stories in his head as a way of trying to explain away the awful things that are happening around him. It's just so sad. And his horror and bravery when he realises what's going on - you really forget that this is just a little kid.Even though there have been a lot of stories written about the Holocaust, this book ought to be required reading. It was one of the biggest (if not the biggest) atrocities of the twentieth century and I don't think it's the kind of subject that will ever be 'done with'. And that's the whole point. As long as we keep reminding ourselves about what happened, then maybe we stand a chance of not repeating our mistakes."}, {"userName": "Alex (not a dude) Baugh", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4449236-alex-not-a-dude-baugh", "userReview": "Once I read a story about a 10 year old Jewish boy named Felix who lived in Poland in 1942 and I felt a terrible sadness as I read.Once is very poignantly narrated by Felix. He tells the reader that he had been placed in a Catholic orphanage by his parents, booksellers in Poland, and has lived there for three years. He also tells the reader that he likes to make up stories and is considered by others to be quite good at it. Felix always carries a notebook in which he writes down his stories and hides it inside his shirt for safekeeping. Once he found a whole carrot in his soup and told himself that it was a sign that his Mum and Dad were coming back to get him. But they never show up. When Nazis suddenly show up at the orphanage to burn the books in the library, Felix remembers the time they destroyed the books in his parent\u2019s bookshop and reasons with himself that the Nazis are only after books. He decides to leave the orphanage and find his Mum and Dad, to warn them that their books are in danger. As Felix goes along looking for his parents, he starts to tell himself stories about what he sees. For example, a few days after he begins his journey, Felix comes across an empty house, with the kitchen stove still burning and half eaten meals on the table. He tells himself a story about the people who live there and why they have left so suddenly: In the distance I hear faint gunshots. Of course. That explains it. They\u2019re out hunting. They must have seen some rabbits, grabbed their guns and gone after them in a big hurry. (pg33)The reader of course knows why the house is empty and what the gunshots are even if Felix doesn\u2019t. Felix is a clever boy who not only creates his own stories, he also uses the knowledge he has acquired from other stories he is familiar with. As his search for his Mum and Dad takes Felix towards an unnamed city, he sees a house on fire and the bloody owners lying outside on the ground. Not sure if they are dead or alive, he picks up a feather and holds it in front of their noses: \u201cIt is how you tell if people are dead. I read it in a book once.\u201d (pg.55) This is also the house where he finds six year old Zelda and the place where a very scary suspicion of reality begins to occur to Felix:A little kid. What sort of people would kill a little kid just for the sake of some books? A horrible thought grows in my throbbing head. What if us Jews aren\u2019t being bullied just because of books? What if it\u2019s because of something else? (pg 56)Felix continues his journey now accompanied by the traumatized Zelda, to whom he continuously tells stories. As they continue on towards the unnamed city, they run into a large group of weary men, women and children walking along the road, all wearing armbands with Jewish stars, and being escorted by Nazi soldiers. At first, Felix thinks they are all Jewish book owners. Forced by the Nazis to join the group, another bit of reality scarily intrudes into Felix\u2019s thoughts after asking one of the men if he is a book lover, then wishes he hadn\u2019t: Not just because I\u2019ve made a suffering Jewish man feel upset at the sight of a crazy kid. Also because I\u2019ve got a horrible suspicion I know the answer to the question.Maybe it\u2019s not just our books the Nazis hate. Maybe it\u2019s us.When Felix and Zelda finally arrive in the city, they are taken into hiding by a dentist who is already taking care of several other children whose parents have been put on transport trains. The dentist, Barney, is a character modeled after a man who actually did take care of Jewish orphans. Janusz Korczak was a Jewish children\u2019s doctor and well known author. When the Nazis rounded up the orphans he was caring for to transport them to Treblinka, they offer Korczak sanctuary. He refused to leave the children, choosing instead to go to his death with them. In his Afterword to Once, Gleitzman explains that Korczak became his hero after reading about him. Once is the story Felix tells us about his life as a child in this particular time and place in the history of the Holocaust. His journey to find his Mum and Dad also turns out to be Felix\u2019s journey from innocence to realization about the situation of Jews under the Nazis. The book is geared for readers aged 11 and up and I would highly recommend it for that age group. Younger readers, even those who have high reading levels, may still find it too disturbing."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846788-ruth", "userReview": "Felix's naivety is almost unbelievable at times. But then you think of the trauma a kid must go through, and how he was VERY misinformed by his parents- add that up with the number of deaths he sees, and you can sorta understand what the author was getting at. So here are some things I've learned from reading Holocaust books:1. Being a Jew must suck. They got chased out of Israel by the Romans, which was when the fled to Europe, which was where many perished at the hands of the Nazis, which was why they fled BACK to Israel, which was why the Palestinians are so pissed (because the Jews took THEIR land of course) which is why there were like a billion wars that followed (Six Day War, Arab-Israeli War, Yom Kippur War, etc.) Which is why now the Jews have their own country that is the only Jewish country in the entire world that is completely surrounded by Arab nations laden with Palestinian refugees who all want Israel dead. So yeah, you would probably suffer more if you were a Jew.2. Being German must suck. They probably still get mouthfuls of soap for what they did during WW23. No matter what the story, every Holocaust book has death, pain, anguish, suffering, death, pain, anguish, and suffering. Which, if you think about it, is pretty good. No stuff is glossed over and you KNOW that it's happened. Which makes the story even more depressing, since it's based during an actual event in history instead of, say, the trolls fighting the fairies over who gets the unicorn.So, yes I WAS depressed after reading Once, because of all of the above, but it was actually a pretty neat story. I finished it in maybe an hour so it definitely is a pretty quick read. Believe it or not, one of my favorite type of books are the Holocaust type. Anytime you need a slice of reality, just pick up the Boy in the Striped Pj's, or the Diary of Anne Frank."}, {"userName": "Elilith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31052139-elilith", "userReview": "Una vez nos cuenta la historia de F\u00e9lix, un ni\u00f1o Jud\u00edo cuyos padres eran propietarios de una librer\u00eda en Polonia y que tras la invasi\u00f3n alemana, sus padres llevaron a un orfanato de monjas para hacerlo pasar por cat\u00f3lico y salvarlo de su destino en los campos de concentraci\u00f3n.

Generally, I\u2019m not into war stories, particularly those written from a child\u2019s perspective. I just don\u2019t have a good track record with them. I\u2019ve read Milkweed and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, both of which are similar to Once. In both books, I wanted to slap the narrators for their naivety of their situations. Since this one was free and the audio was only 3 hours I decided to give it a try.The story is told from Felix\u2019s perspective, a young Jewish boy, who was left by his parents in a Catholic orphanage. His parents were booksellers, which explains Felix\u2019s love of books and storytelling. Because Felix likes to tell stories he is not the most reliable narrator. Many times he makes up stories to explain away the horrors he encounters or to simply make himself feel better. While, I did sometimes want to slap Felix for his naivety I did give him a pass because of his bookish background. Actually, I think that is why Once\u2019s narration worked for me better than the other two books did. I ended up liking Felix quite a bit. I found myself sympathizing with him and wanting to protect him. Of course war is horrific, but reading it from the perspective of a child seems to be more heart wrenching. I thought the plot and perspective were well done and at no point did I feel emotionally manipulated. Apart from Felix there are a few other characters important to the story, like Zelda and Barney. Zelda reminded me of Ygritte from \u201cA Games of Thrones\u201d series with her constant \u201cDon\u2019t you know anything?\u201d. After a third time or so of listening to it I was ready to throttle her. Barney\u2019s character was definitely interesting and I was surprised to find out that his character was based on a true story. This made the ending more poignant for me. Overall, despite some minor complaints this one was enjoyable as a war time read could be. The book is marked for middle grade kids, but just be warned that there is death and a bit of violence in the story."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49013147-david", "userReview": "3.5 Holocaust books are always so hard to rate because regardless of the quality of the book I commend the author for trying to tell such an important and difficult story. This story takes the form of the perspective of a nine year old Polish boy trying to understand the horror of his circumstances. I think the makings of an excellent book were definitely here, and that the author did a commendable job, but it just didn't work for me. Having a nine year old at home certainly allowed me to really think about the book from that perspective, but I just felt like that perspective didn't come off in an authentic and accurate way. I am very happy I read this book because although it is heartbreaking, it did make me contemplate one of history's worst atrocities through the eyes of children. This is a lesson that is good to remember when one looks at history, or even makes decisions in the present. My knit picking aside, I do think this is a book that a lot of people would really enjoy and that is accessible to numerous reading levels and age groups."}, {"userName": "Bosorka", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14155821-bosorka", "userReview": "Tenk\u00e1 kn\u00ed\u017eka, kter\u00e1 m\u011b oslovila vn\u011bj\u0161kem (ob\u00e1lkou) a nezklamala ani vnit\u0159kem (d\u011bjem).

I appreciated the self-denial aspect, but I also thought a child of that age group would've been more intelligent. The failure to comprehend (or admit comprehension) carried on far too long in my view. I know the rest of the world adored this book. It is well-written and has some quirky, everyday touches viz. the way Spielberg placed the red jacket in his largely B&W film, \"Schindler's List\". But quite frankly I thought this book diminished the child reader's acuity and as such was not (for me) helpful with the overall topic itself. I am reminded that this is a very sensitive area within a genre needing care & consideration. I admire the bravery of those who go there for the sake of young readers. I hope I haven't offended anyone who read and admired this book, but to me it is not a children's book because of the content & it is not an adult's book because of the prose.

Among these authors, Gleitzman must stand as among the best. The way he takes the main character, Felix, from misunderstanding through naive simplicity to full awareness and understanding of the suffering of his people is sublime. Despite us already knowing much of what Felix does not know at the start, we are taken on his journey with him and, as the understanding dawns, we are dragged through the same emotional turmoil.I read this book with a class of year 8 students (ages 12-13) and it affected them as much as any great text I have read with a class.
