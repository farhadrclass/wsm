It's England, 1940, and there's a war on, but you wouldn't know it in the quiet Shropshire town of Whitchurch. Things change when the body of a young Land Girl is found along side a road, shot through the head. Tom must find the culprit, while dealing with his crumbling marriage, a son left traumatized by Dunkirk and the return of a former love.This is well written and researched with finely drawn characters and a satisfying mystery.

Inspector Tom Tyler is roused from his usual rather boring job in the small town of Whitchurch when one of the Land Army girls is found brutally murdered and posed. England is at war, and these girls are trucked in from the cities to help farmers with crops while most of the men are serving their country. The killing rouses suspicion that there may be a \"Jerry\" on the loose who possibly parachuted in, but Tyler believes the killer is much closer to home. When the post-mortem reveals that the girl was struck by a vehicle first and shot afterwards, he's almost certain of it. The question is whether it was a crime of chance or whether someone deliberately targeted the girl and why.Suspicion naturally falls first to the people of German descent interred at a local camp, although he's been assured that they are mostly harmless Jews who were also enemies of Hitler, having fled Germany for safer environs. Security also seems tight there, so it's unlikely that any of the men could have escaped--especially with use of a vehicle to have hit the girl with. The second death of another of the girls complicates the investigation even more.Tyler's investigation is further complicated by the return of his former lover, Clare, now married to a wealthy Swiss businessman. She is working as an interpreter and censor in the camp and seems interested in renewing their affair, even though Tyler is married too, albeit unhappily. Tyler is also worried about his son Jimmy, recently returned from the battle at Dunkirk with a bad case of shell shock, and with other family problems.I wanted to like this book more than I did, and I can't actually pinpoint exactly what it was that made me want to just get it finished by the time I got to the middle part. It seemed a bit put on if that makes any sense...like the author was trying TOO hard to make you think it was 1940, but you could still see the modern-day interpretation of things on the surface of it all. It didn't have the atmosphere of immersing you in the time and place like any good historical fiction or mystery book does, and I'm not sure just what the magic ingredient is but it was missing here."}, {"userName": "Ben", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9358340-ben", "userReview": "Season of Darkness is not a well-put-together book. The story is decent (but not superb), the writing style is easy enough to read, but the editing and proof reading was surprisingly bad for an accomplished and well-known author. Maureen Jennings' previous work, which became the popular TV movie and program called Murdoch Mysteries, should mean this new trilogy would be well-written and well-edited. Unfortunately there are far too many grammatical errors and omitted words to make it enjoyable. It is amazing how such a few number can slow you down and make you not enjoy the book.In terms of the mystery element, I found it less suspenseful and more of a \"I wonder what happens next\" plot. There were a lot of things which I didn't see coming, but once they happened it was less an element of intrigue as just surprise Jennings went that way. Some of the events also seemed forced, like the only way to make them make sense was to explain them after the fact. This wasn't all that big of a deal because I had longer breaks between reading, so having an easy storyline was what I needed.The British countryside is a nice touch, there is definitely a feeling of being in a small town, but all the action happens at the police office, Alice Thorne's house, the Prees Heath camp, and Tyler's home. There is a vague description of two neighbourhood pubs and what seemed to be a surprisingly modern and stylish bachelor pad for Tyler's love interest.And that brings me to one of the annoying parts of this book: the love story. It was completely useless! I know each good story needs a bit of romance, but it was like Jennings fell into a soft-core porno lit chapter (or five) of mushy, possibly emotional, possibly pointless sex. I couldn't tell if it would lead anywhere, I knew it didn't have too much to do with the story (at least nothing more important than just a mention of Clare and Tom's history), and I didn't like reading it. There was also pretty much no closure for that part of the story, and I felt for a few other plot lines as well.Overall this book was a decent way to kill time and get into summer reading mode, but if you want a more engaging story, choose something else. I'll give this a 2.5-3 out of 5 simply because the story is good enough to keep you engaged while reading it, and not too much detail to bog you down. It is a good book to pick up and put down when you need but it won't fufill any deep need for suspense or complicated plots."}, {"userName": "An Odd1", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863716-an-odd1", "userReview": "http://www.cbc.ca/murdochmysteries/ep... author's consultant on favorite TV 1900 Toronto Detective Murdoch is preferred, for humor, costumes. Cannot \"like\" this brutal murder mystery, or read sequels. But terrifyingly accurate powerful depiction of reality deserves credit. Uncorrected proof (disclaimer) kept me and others up all night (also tried to prevent nightmares by staying awake). Gruesome war visuals may be true, but hard to swallow. Title is from Charles Dickens 'A Tale of Two Cities'. First of trilogy is set in WW2 England, era of physical and morale blackouts. The sad serious style sends us back in time and place, immediately engages and provokes curiosity, continues with ebb and flow of brutal action and relaxed interview details about rural village and internment camp lives, not the flirting romance and joking banter of TV shows. Here, Jennings crushes bone, blood, brain, and soul. Reality is even worse. One Torchwood TV episode fictionalized true events, when shell-shocked WW1 soldier ordered shot with 300 others by British superiors for desertion. Our modern doctors ineffectually diagnose PTSD post trauma stress disorder, prescribe drugs, and our Afghanistan veterans flounder back 'home'. We need stomach for the evil Jennings exposes. Retold second and third-hand, we are distanced from the terror, feel immersed rather than lectured, with descriptions, not arguments. Nevertheless painfully affecting, too skillful, commend to stronger of stomach. In the italicized prologue, a soldier burns off a tattoo with a cigarette, then repeats on the other underarm - shows his sadistic psychopathic amorality. In Chapter 1, light-fingered generous-hearted Elsie from impoverished East End London is one of the Farm Girls, who feed the country; their jobs replace men now in uniform. In the dark, she cycles, sings bawdy Hitler ditties, remembers last night's passionate snog and opportunistic blackmail. In Chapter 2, Tom Tyler is an unhappily married hungover Shropshire constable sent to the girl's body. She was paralyzed by a hit and run driver, shot in the head with a WW1 German Luger, and decorated with white poppies, a Peace movement symbol. The narrative focuses on the investigation, with italics for brief anonymous villain's deeds. Tom re-unites with his first love, obviously MI5. Amorous interludes are discreet. Disclaimer for first pre-release copy. Has \"ed sp\" inside angle brackets, between events, both contiguous but unrelated, and others smoothly continuous. Two typos caught: p. 37 wants 'in' for 'it', p.248 needs 'wringer' not 'ringer'. Acceptable 'carcase' is alternate for 'carcass'. The dialogue, slang, and expressions are fluent, easy, feel at-home, never over-researched."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "I'm sort of surprised that I read this all the way through. What a creepy bunch of folks: Tom Tyler, the main character and a policeman, may no longer love his wife, but without more information about her and their relationship, I can say he acts like a total cad, to put it nicely. His main squeeze is also a creep from beyond the pale...she was Tom's lover once, and took off to be married without a word to him. Now she shows up again, still married, and refuses to acknowledge Tom's wife and family and wants to start the relationship up again, but only temporarily. Who are these people and why are we reading about them? Several other folks in the mix--townspeople, internees (this is WWI), black-marketeers, and spies--seem to have inappropriate responses to events. I hated this.

Overall I enjoyed the story but found the use of \"time specific\" vocabulary and references a bit too much. I can see where someone like Tom Tyler and other characters might speak that way but would have appreciated a glossary of some sort to explain some of the terms (Google filled in my lacking vocabulary here for the most part though). Even having read Great Expectations years ago I got a bit confused with how the characters in this book were comparing themselves to \"Miss Havisham's Estelle\" and \"Pip with the thick boots\". The ones I did recognize (the more common ones I suppose) were all crammed into the first 50 pages or so...One major difference I noticed reading this book compared to many of the other mystery books I've read is that is is highly personal. Instead of the detective being hired to solve a case involving complete strangers for merely a paycheck, some accolades, or to help make life easier for someone else, the detectives immediate family is closely involved in one way or another. This makes the detectives work and home lives intertwine which I like to see as then you see a more rounded view of the detectives personality and character. I also enjoyed seeing that the detective was in some ways flawed and wasn't afraid to admit when they were stumped rather than seeming to be perfect and having all the answers miraculously appear to them with little effort.Although in some cases the book was a bit more lude and graphic than I'd prefer in my choice of reading material it did have several lines that had me laughing out loud. I look forward to the next installment in this trilogy to see where Maureen Jennings takes Tom Tyler next as I haven't a clue. So much seems to have been included in this first book that I wonder what is left. I certainly hope no more hardships come to the Tyler family as each was severely affected in this book alone. I felt sorry most for Vera (Tom's wife) who's feelings seemed to be pushed aside on many occasions."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3047454-leslie", "userReview": "A well-paced historical mystery set in the Shropshire countryside in the summer of 1940, as England was moving from the false calm of the phony war into the full horrors of the Nazi threat. A Land Army girl is found dead on a country road and the search for her killer gets more complicated when another girl disappears and the fear engendered by the violence so close to home connects to the fear of the perhaps-looming German invasion and the complicated emotions stirred by the frantic escape from the continent at Dunkirk. The traumas of war are already making themselves felt in the village and no one has figured out how to deal with them or what they mean. The public and the private, the personal and the political, the local and the global all come together in complicated ways, and the tension lurks behind everything. Tom Tyler is a good and interesting detective figure, a good man wrestling with the difficulty of goodness. A very appealing start to what has the potential to become a very good series.I received this book, which I read in uncorrected proofs, through Goodreads' First Reads giveaways programme.

Perhaps for better or worse there's slightly less detail of the country and the times than in corresponding Ian Rutledge titles by Charles Todd. The ending might be less of a surprise solution than you might expect, but even when you knew it had to be, sympathy is the emotion anyone will feel as the last bit of answer is revealed.
