Philippa Gregory's books are most often written from the perspective of a strong (for the era) and like able female lead. The Red Queen, from the perspective of Margaret Beaufort, shows a sometimes strong but unlikeable (in my opinion) female. Still worth the read, especially if you love medieval and Tudor history as I do."}, {"userName": "Sylvia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23161635-sylvia", "userReview": "I have read all of her books.
