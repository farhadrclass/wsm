OMG I love Simon so fuckin' much. Now that is a hero. God I wanna just throw him down and rub all over him. Scarred, damaged, angry and hurting. I just wanted to kiss all his boo boos better. To fix him, make him happy. This book was everything I wanted. I loved Montana. She was sweet, funny, and totally accepting of Simon and his burn scars. But Simon was the icing on the cake for me. In the book a few times they called him catnip and he really was like catnip to me. Damn but I freakin' adored him. Even when he was pissy I loved him. He could do no wrong in my eyes.

Finally coming into her own, career-wise anyway, as a service-dog trainer, Montana's first encounter with surgeon Simon Bradly is less than ideal. An over-eager dog named Fluffy runs wild and ends up in Dr. Bradley's burn ward, with a frantic Montana rushing in after her. After giving her a dressing down a Marine drill sergeant would be proud of, Simon thinks he's seen the last of Montana and her ill-behaved animals. But one patient, a severely burned little girl, finds Fluffy amusing, and Simon must eat his words and ask Montana if she has another service-dog, perhaps one less enthusiastic than Fluffy, who might be an appropriate visitor in his ward. Simon has issues, a LOT of issues, most of them stemming from his horrific childhood, which left him with burn scars of his own. And though Montana has been charged by the Fool's Gold hospitality committee to persuade Dr. Bradley to move to Fool's Gold permanently, she's got an uphill battle. Simon has made it his mission in life to travel the world offering his surgical skills to those patients who might not otherwise have access to treatment for their burns. And Fool's Gold is just one stop of many. I really enjoyed watching Simon and Montana come together, and heal one anothers' wounds. Whereas Montana gave Simon the confidence he needed to let himself care about the people in his life, Simon boosted Montana's confidence in herself as a woman. And the service dogs added a lovely means to illustrate their burgeoning confidence, especially Simon's interactions with CeeCee and Montana's with Buddy and the reading program. When they finally are able to declare their love for one another, it's a wonderfully satisfying moment.With some very intriguing subplots--including a secret history between Montana's boss, Max, and her mother--and visits to all my favorite Fool's Gold fixtures, ONLY YOURS is a great way to while away a rainy weekend. I can't wait to see what happens next!"}, {"userName": "Ana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1316580-ana", "userReview": "Montana Hendrix has finally found her dream job - working with therapy dogs. Working with them is everything she ever wanted, so when she looses control of one of the dogs, and the said dog runs into a hospital wreaking havoc, she doesn't need Dr. Simon Bradley yelling at her to feel bad. Simon has a good reason to be furious - a dog in a burn unit where a lot of patients can't be exposed to germs is bad. Granted, it was an accident, but still, the irresponsibility of it puts him on edge. If only the attraction between him and Montana, the dog's handler, wasn't so strong.Simon has been hurt badly in a fire when he was just a child and he still bears the scars that set him apart. His childhood was horrific, and he never knew what love is like. And now, there's Montana tempting him, and making him think that things could be different. Montana had a happy childhood, surrounded by a loving family. She dreams of love, marriage and children. She knows that Simon is the wrong man for her, but resisting him is nearly impossible. There were some things I liked in the book: Simon, the dark and tortured hero, the town of Fools Gold, the dogs... I liked Montana's nephew Reese - he's a great kid, ant pretty mature for his age.I'm curious about Denise's past and I want to know what is it that happened between her and Max (Montana's boss).But there were more things that annoyed me. 1.Montana for one - she kept pushing Simon, trying to \"fix\" him even when he makes it clear that she shouldn't poke. She's too cheerful and good and kind. Some flaw would be nice. 2.I'm sick and tired of the story of how the triplets got their names. It was in couple of the books in the series along with one of the other suggestions - Oceania.3. A lot emphasis was put on how Montana found her calling and is finally happy with her job - but we were told that (over and over again) and yet when Montana never thinks of that, it's like this job is everything she ever did. 4.Everything in the book is somehow sweet (besides Simon's childhood). Everyone was good and kind, and always willing to help. It simply didn't seem realistic to me. I barely finished the book.All in all, it's an OK read if you're looking for a romance set in a small town.Rating:2.5 stars*ARC received from NetGalley*"}, {"userName": "D", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3046362-d", "userReview": "This is the fifth book in this series (I think) but I've only read four of them. I'm going to complain in general because all of the books are really similar. I hate how these end as soon as the I love you's are declared. Like life is all happily ever after as soon as it's said. Silly. In more than one book of this series, the heroine has gotten pregnant \"accidentally\" and then had to of course decide to raise the child on her own, absolving the father of all responsibility because they don't want to make the guy think they did it on purpose. Are all the women of this town that dumb, or just the ones that have stories told about them? Or all the men for that matter? Wear a damn condom. And I know that I wouldn't live in this town, the death rate seems abnormally high for such a small town. I did like Montana and Simon though. I think she is my favorite heroine so far. It would have been Liz, except that Ethan was such a dumbass I couldn't stand it. I know I will still read the others though, which I think says more about the crap I like to read than about the books actually being that good. This galley was terrible! It had double pages, and I couldn't adjust the text size so it went from having two tiny repeating pages to huge text with the sentences from the two repeat pages mixed up."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/672625-susan", "userReview": "Only YoursSusan MalleryONLY YOURS is the fifth book in the Fools Gold series and I can't believe I waited so long to read this collection of funny and romantic stories. There are forty three books in this series and I'm hoping to get a huge batch of them read this year. ONLY YOURS is also the second book in the Fools Gold Romance trilogy that covers the love story of the three Hendrix sisters who also happen to be triplets. ONLY YOURS is Montana's story.Montana is kooky but oh so lovable that you can't help but cheer her on as she tries to figure out her place in Fools Gold. She has finally found a job she loves and her life seems to be going right for once. That is until she runs into Doctor crabby butt, I mean Dr. Simon Bradley. Simon has many many issues, but he is an excellent surgeon who takes care of children who have been badly burned or scarred. Simon has his own scars and at first Montana wonders what happened to him but wouldn't dream of asking him. ONLY YOURS deals with so many different emotions that one minute I was giggling and the next tearing up. Trust me, when you learn the truth of what Simon has endured since he was a child, it will blow your mind and break your heart.Montana finds herself at the hospital interacting with one of Simon's patients, Kalinda, who is severely burned. Montana brings one of the therapy dogs from her job to visit with Kalinda to help take her mind off the pain of her burns. CeeCee is instantly smitten with Simon and is really helping Kalinda. As much as Montana doesn't want to be around Simon, she loves helping distract Kalinda. ONLY YOURS will surely pull at your heart strings and make it very hard for you to put down. If you are like me, you won't be able to stop until you know what happens to all of these beautiful people in Fools Gold.Make yourself a yummy hot drink, get your favorite blanket and get on the couch. ONLY YOURS is an awesome way to spend the afternoon or evening. I'm so excited to continue with the Fools Gold series and learn more about my new found friends. Once you start ONLY YOURS you won't be able to put it down and will find yourself cheering for Simon and Montana as they try to navigate their way through a very different and unique situation.

A miracle. An Author Goddess. I love her. And I loved this book. Ever since I learned the premise of this book, I was excited to read about Montana and Simon. And they did not disappoint at all. In fact, they were better than I hoped. The plot was pretty fantastic, too, and I wasn't remotely bored or disinterested at any point in the novel.With each book I read about the triplets, I am amazed by how different they are. The previous book of the series was about Dakota, this one about Montana, and the next is about Nevada. For all their similarities, the women are remarkably different and that makes me love them and their characters all the more. Montana tries to always make the best of a situation, which can get annoying but I found endearing in her. She also doesn't have the best self-confidence because of her past experience with men, and I loved that she was able to finally start accepting herself. Not just because of Simon's attention but because she realized how awesome she is. Now Simon, I love him just as much as I love Montana. He has his personal demons to get through, which he never puts much effort into until he meets Montana and she makes him feel alive and not quite as uncomfortable with life. She helps him see that he doesn't have to sacrifice himself for the sake of others because of the gift he's been given. And he makes quite a transformation by the end!Storylines I Was Super Interested In/Am Interested In Seeing Continued:1. Kalinda (And Reese).I really enjoyed the storyline with Kalinda. Of course, I don't like that the poor child was burned horribly, but she was an interesting edition to the book, and she helped Simon learn some things about himself, too. I also loved how cute she and Reese were together.2. Denise and Max. We know that Denise has been starting to date again recently, and then we are thrown this romantic past between her and Max, Montana's boss. I can't wait to see where this goes. I am interested to know, however, if it is just going to be played out in the next book, or if Denise and Max have their own book in the works.3. Kent Hendrix. Up until this point, Ethan was the only Hendrix brother we really knew much about. Finally, though, another brother shows up! Kent is back in town, with his son Reese, after his wife left and divorced him. Now obviously we can't leave the adorable Hendrix brother all alone forever! So, I'm wondering if he also has a book in the works. And, who could it be with? The only single woman around his age that I can recall is Jo. And she's interesting enough on her own since no one really knows where she came from.4. Ford Hendrix. He is the last Hendrix brother and we know nothing about him beside the fact that he's in the military. So that begs the question, is he going to come back in the next Fool's Gold book, or anytime in the near Fool's Gold future? If so, will he get a book, too? I mean, we need to fix up the rest of the Hendrix family, as we can't pair up some but not all. That would just be unfair! (To them and me.)So many questions, too few answers. I am extremely excited for the next book, Only His, about Nevada Hendrix and Tucker Janack.

Oh my!There is a lot I liked about this book. I liked the hero and his dilemma. I liked the supporting characters and I liked the involvement of the burn unit and Kalinda.But I disliked a whole lot too - allow me to rant for a moment. I started to get annoyed with the way that Mallery introduces characters from past books. We get an entire synopsis of their own book. It starts to get eye-roll-worthy-annoying. I also found that this happened in relation to Montana. Everyone kept saying \"she didn't know what to do with her life but now she does\" but we don't really see it in her character. We see that she is happy with her day job - but we don't see signs of previous unrest or extreme contentment. So I guess, in sum, there is a lot of telling but not showing in this book.And the ending! It was one of THOSE ending. You know, the quick unsatisfying kind. I also felt that for the size of the book there wasn't enough profound feeling or drama between the two main characters, it was all very lukewarm. That isn't to say that it isn't elsewhere in the book. I did get misty eyed especially in regards to Kalinda but the two main characters seem so mellow.So 3/5 stars. Cute but I had no problem setting it down to do laundry.**Keep in mind that the arc I relieved had double pages (1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6, etc.) which was annoying to read and navigate through and that might have reflected negatively on my opinion of the story."}, {"userName": "Splage", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4755656-splage", "userReview": "I have to say the second group of 3, \"The Only's\", I have enjoyed much more than \"The Perfect's\". Not sure if because of the triplet's personalities or what, but I read them easily in one day. The hero Simon did take awhile to grow on me, but I LOVED him in the end. My only wish in both this book and book 4 is that when the hero hurts the heroine, which happened several times in both books, I wanted the hero to run back to the heroine and ask for forgiveness, not let 1 to 2 weeks pass before they see each other again...such a waste of good times they could have been having. It seemed the heroine always got the short end of the stick."}, {"userName": "Jacob Proffitt", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1331641-jacob-proffitt", "userReview": "And this is why I continue with the series, even after two in a row that I kind of hated. Or, at least, this is what I had hoped for. I find Mallery's characters really engaging when they aren't being selfish about children.Montana really is all that and a bag of chips. I loved everything about her, from her courage, to her strength, to her caring about her family and friends, and I even found her insecurities engaging (probably because she was able to acknowledge them and she was working so hard on overcoming them). Really, there wasn't anything to dislike and spending time with her was a great deal of fun.Simon wasn't as fun, but he was nearly as engaging. Part of that is realizing how much of his damage was on the inside. Mallery does a fantastic job letting us into the twisted little prison he's built for himself and that drew me to him even as I could see the damage he was going to do to poor Montana. Since I had confidence in her strength and courage (and I'm reading a romance novel) I felt she could take the hit and still believe in the relationship working out as Simon worked out his demons.There were a few clumsy aspects of the novel that detracted a bit. Insta-chemistry is a bit less obnoxious than insta-love but it's at least a second cousin. Related, at any rate, and this book is a particularly strong case of that. Simon was burning for Montana from their first encounter and I found that as unlikely as it was annoying. I'd have much preferred a gentler burn that would have let their physical relationship grow with their emotional one.I also wasn't a fan of Denise's dating scenes. They felt like an oddly misplaced caricature in an otherwise upscale gallery. In a book with such great secondary characters (Kalinda and Reese walked away with a piece of my heart and that's quite a feat for twelve year-olds), this was particularly jarring. I'm not saying she should be finding true love or anything, but watching one stereotype after another was depressing.Anyway, this was a great read and a lot of fun. Montana was a joy and Simon working out his demons had a well-earned emotional payout.A note about Steamy: A little lighter than normal, but still with the (standard) two explicit scenes. The lighter bit is that there was less play (which is appropriate as Simon wasn't really a \"play\" kind of guy)."}, {"userName": "Connie N.", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3154417-connie-n", "userReview": "I'm in love with Fool's Gold and the people who live there. It feels so comfortable and casual each time I read another book in the series--like I'm going to a familiar vacation spot or something. I'm enjoying this trilogy within the series, each following one of the triplets. These women are warm and funny and full of life, each with their own quirks and worries. Can't wait to read the next story in the series.6/6/17 - #5 in the Fool's Gold romance series - This time I'm listening to the audiobook version. Eby does a fine job of narration, with good distinction between voices. I've enjoyed this book the most so far in this series, although not as much as the first time I read it when I gave it a 5-star rating. Montana Hendryx is a much more laid-back character. She has some self-esteem issues since she's been unsure about her career path, but now she's part of the therapy-dog program in town and has found her calling. She's great with the dogs, is very knowledgeable, and she's warm and friendly with the people she comes in contact with. Dr. Simon Bradley, on the other hand, is standoffish and hot-tempered. But as we get to know him we realize that his gruffness covers his lack of social skills as well as a kind heart--he's someone who always goes the extra mile for his patients. He's a skilled plastic surgeon who travels from place to place--wherever he's needed the most. While he's at Fool's Gold, he is taking care of many burn victims as well as some other patients. Of course the town wants him to stay and be a part of the new state-of-the-art hospital that's going to be built. Montana and he have an instant chemistry, but Simon is resisting--saying he's leaving and afraid to get close because of his history of being hurt by those he's loved. They make a great opposites-attract couple. I liked their relationship and the way they bonded over the service dogs. The town didn't seem quite as meddling as they have in previous books--or else I'm getting more used to it."}, {"userName": " Shellbelle ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3630915-shellbelle", "userReview": "[her baby Hannah, and pregnant with the next (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Sophie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60630528-sophie", "userReview": "I thought Susan Mallery can't get any better....Ooops, was I wrong :)I'm kinda used to insta-love in her books but what I truly love about her books is that the progress of the story take just the right amount of time.

It was so good to see some real heat and passion in this story, and the balance between \u201cnovel\u201d elements and \u201cromance\u201d elements was just right. I liked that the story had other things going on in it to support the romance: both Montana and Simon have meaningful, important careers that were interesting to read about, and a subplot about Montana\u2019s mom is a real teaser that makes me want to hurry on to the next book. But there was also some nummy angst, and though Simon resists Montana for much of the book, he never felt indifferent towards her.Simon is a fascinating hero. I thought at first he was intended to have Aspgerers Syndrome, but now think he was just a highly gifted child who was kept from ever fully participating in everyday life because of his uniqueness and his tragic past. He cares deeply about his damaged patients, but has trouble relating to people on an everyday basis.Minor complaints: a bit too much repetition, a bit too much small-town fulsomeness, and the character of Nevada irritated me by always seeming to be a mouthpiece to point out how this was not a secret baby story for a change. Since she's the heroine of the next book, it's kind of s shame to go into it already a bit down on her.But overall, I think this is Mallory's best book in ages and am glad I didn't give up on her.

This makes us immediately much more invested in how Montana's relationship works out. Now that she's finding her place in the world, you root for her and Simon the moment you meet him (as abrasive as he is). Simon is really the star of the novel. His complete emotional detachment is reminiscent of Raoul's romance, but it's taken further to the point where you often have to wonder if he has feelings at all. The developing relationship between the two and Simon's own personal development make the book that much more heartwarming.What disappointed me: Absolutely nothing.Recommended: Yes.

I loved just about everything about this installment of the \u201cFool's Gold\u201d series. It had me hooked in right from the start and I read it in less than a day. Didn't want to put it down.Series Note:Fifth full length book in the \u201cFool's Gold\u201d series about a small California town where women outnumber men. I wouldn't say it's necessary to read the previous books before this one, but I think you'd benefit more if you did.Summary:Montana Hendrix has always considered herself to be the screw up among her triplet sisters. She's failed in her relationships, had a hard time finding a career, and doesn't think she's anywhere near as pretty or fun as her sisters. But she's comfortable in her life now that she's been working helping to train service dogs. Then the mayor of Fool's Gold comes to her and asks for Montana's help in getting a world renowned plastic surgeon and burn specialist, Simon Bradley, who is on temporary assignment at the local hospital to stay permanently.The two get off to a terrible start after an unfortunate incident involving a dog, but when one of Simon's young burn patients wants a dog to visit her, Simon goes to see Montana. This time, he's intrigued by the woman. He's helpless to stop the affair that begins. But Simon has deep scars, physical and emotional, that keep him from letting things grow between him and Montana. He may want her, and relish the love she gives him, but he can't stay. Until push comes to shove and he's forced to reevaluate his life.Review:There was so much about this book that I liked. It taped into so man things that I enjoy reading about in books. And it also tugged at the heartstrings and brought tears to my eyes more than once.First you've got a brooding, scared, emotionally broken hero. Poor Simon has been through hell in his life. He's a burn survivor and child abuse victim who turns to healing others as a way to do good in the world because he feels he's inferior. It just breaks your heart what the guy has been through. It would be easy at times to get annoyed with him during the story because he is so cut off emotionally and so up and down about his relationship with Montana, but because of his past you can also thoroughly understand it and sympathize with the position he finds himself in. He was one of those characters that makes you want to give him a hug and help make it all better.Montana was a pretty cool character as well. She feels like she's the underachiever among her triplet sisters. Plus she's had some relationships that really battered her emotionally. Yet she's still bright and fun. I can't say she was a fantastic character. But I liked her.And these two together just worked. They each give something to the other that they need. Simon helps Montana feel beautiful and successful, and Montana helps Simon see that he doesn't need to isolate his life as being only a brilliant doctor. There's also some great chemistry between them. I enjoyed reading about them and thought they were perfect together.Then there's the animal part of the book. As an animal lover, I love reading books that have animals playing a role in them. In this case, Montana helps train service dogs...ones that visit hospitals, nursing homes, and she's even helped develop a program where children having difficulty reading read to dogs because it is less intimidating. I loved reading all the scenes involving the dogs. They were fantastic. Some of them heartbreaking, some of the heartwarming.And of course, you get to revisit the town of Fool's Gold, which I love (though not as much as Robyn Carr's Virgin River...best fictional town ever). I love small town stories where people still care and have values. You also get to catch up with past characters and see how they are doing. That's always a favorite of mine among series books.Oh, and there's also a sub-story about Montana's mom, and her mysterious past with Montana's boss. You learn a little bit but still more to come on that story, I'm guessing. We'll probably get more on that in future books. I can't say I love stories involving romance between older folks, but it's a kinda interesting one.I'm really looking forward to reading the final book in this 2nd \u201cFool's Gold\u201d trilogy. I've enjoyed the first two, and the original trilogy, quite a bit and can't wait to see how Nevada's storyline goes."}, {"userName": "Caroline The HEA Lover", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2675576-caroline-the-hea-lover", "userReview": "(this review was originally posted on Book Lovers Inc)After reading Only Mine all I wanted was to get the next book so I could plunge right back in Fool's Gold. Only Yours focuses this time on Montana's story. I can already tell you it was a cute and funny story! Not that I doubted it would be anything but. *wink*Montana has a job she loves, training dogs so they would help people. I have to say I envied her job. Who wouldn't like training puppies into being serviceable dogs! I love how Susan Mallery characterized Montana's dogs. They are so cute and I'm sure if you have a dog it'll make you want to reach out and pet it. I'm a sucker for cute pets in books (yes I'm easy like that). And what did you know that one of Montana's puppy landed her right into the arms of a very sexy man. I couldn't help but laugh at how it happened.Cue dark and sexy hero, aka Simon. Ladies, prepare the fan because this hero is one tough cookie. I do have a thing for jerk/dark/brooding/scarred/sexy heroes...well isn't that my luck! Here we are with the perfect candidate. *g* Simon is tortured and no, I didn't always understand him, but sometimes people are weird that way and they don't always make sense. At least he had the good sense to realize it ;). We could say that Montana didn't really make a good first impression, but the same could be said for Simon. They got off on a rocky start but I loved the sexual tension between them. Simon is...intense...and it was very interesting to see how unsettle he was around Montana.Only Yours is a sexy and cute story. I'm dying to read the next book to read more about the triplet's mother. She has one really fascinating story and I cannot waiiiiiiit to see where this go *g*. My only complaint about the story is that it felt a bit like a dej\u00e0-vu. Well maybe it is on purpose but some things were a bit too much like the first book. The story is predictable but it doesn't take any fun from reading it, I'd even go as far as to say that it was reassuring to know I could predict how it would end (I don't do well with suspense).I can say it with all my heart this book was a very good Summer read. If you're not already addicted to Fool's Gold you should definitely give this series a try.I give Only Yours 4 Bookies"}, {"userName": "Paige", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3569773-paige", "userReview": "[ especially after his mother pushed him into a burning fireplace\u2026.twice  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Romancing the Book", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5328566-romancing-the-book", "userReview": "Reviewed by JenBook received from NetGalleyThis is the second of the Hendrix triplet's stories and the fifth of the Fool's Gold series. Of this series, I've only read Only Mine, book four. However, I'm a huge fan of Susan Mallery's so when I say this book on NetGalley. I had to grab it.Montana has always struggled to find her place as the youngest of triplets, but the pieces seem to fall in place when she begins to train service dogs. The story begins with Montana talking a walk with a dog-in-training. Fluffy gets loose and ends up running around the local hospital and while Montana is chasing him, she literally runs into Simon, a doctor who is not understanding about this accident.Simon's a world renown surgeon, specializing in burn victims. He's visiting Fool's Gold for a short stint in the hospital. Due to a traumatic childhood, Simon is determined to keep his distance from everyone and not form any attachments. But something about Montana worms her way past his defenses and add in a spunky dog and a young burn victim and Simon is a goner.I love how Ms Mallery spins a tale. She has a way of creating characters that just reach in and tug at your heart strings. I really felt for Simon as his past is revealed and how it effected his life and relationships -- especially as he fought his growing feelings for Montana. But what I really like is that while this book is a part of a series and past characters (and ones who will star in future books) make appearances, the book focuses on the stars and doesn't really have any subplots to complete for time. And what subplots there are, are relevant to Simon's and Montana's story.I'm looking forward to the next book in the series, and hunting down some past books so I can revisit Fool's Gold."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4637744-laurie", "userReview": "Montana Hendrix has found her calling\u2014working with therapy dogs.

She was also caring, compassionate, and passionate. Simon had a passion for his work, but soon found out what passion and love combined could do to his heart. Totally unprepared for love, Simon has to overcome his haunting past to be with the woman he loves. This was a very touching love story that was real and down to earth. Mallery captured a man healing from past wounds with finesse, and painted a picture of a love story with many inward battles not to mention the outside influences that were overcome.

You already know the general plot and how it will turn out, right? I once refused to finish reading a book because it the characters were entirely unbelievable (15th century Scottish warrior telling the heroine to take a hot bath and relax didn't ring true). Susan Mallery's \"Only Yours\" is at the opposite end of that spectrum. Her characters are fully realized and completely believable. Montana Hendrix trains therapy dogs. She gives her whole heart her career, in part because she struggled for so long to find her passion. Simon Bradley is a surgeon specializing in traumatically injured children. Their first meeting is a disaster, but soon the sparks are flying. There's just one catch - Simon isn't staying in Fool's Gold. How Montana deals with this is one of the things that made her so believable to me. She knows that what she and Simon share is special, even if it isn't lasting. She doesn't try to change Simon but loves him as he is. Her love heals, just as much Simon's surgical skills...and in much the same way as the affection the therapy dogs she trains. As always, I adore the secondary characters and catching up on people introduced earlier in the Fool's Gold series. I'd love to live in that town! But what I love most about this book is Montana and Simon. They are vibrant, realistic, and completely believable."}, {"userName": "Jasmine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50863979-jasmine", "userReview": "After changing between multiple jobs, Montana Hendrix has finally settled on being a trainer for therapy dogs.

But when Montana literally comes crashing into his life, what he believed was a mere chemical attraction becomes something much more.This book is definitely Beauty & the Beast inspired and I totally loved it. I'm such a sucker for those sulky guys who give into their angst, punishing themselves because they don't believe they deserve to be loved (but that's just me). Abusive mothers aren't a new idea when it comes to the Fool's Gold series, but Simon's past is tragic and traumatic. You can't help but want to hug him! Then there's the beautiful Montana, with insecurities of her own, which were further enhanced by three unsuccessful relationships with boys who treated her like she wasn't good enough. Simon and Montana find beauty in each other, resulting in recognizing the beauty in themselves - a really beautiful love story and perfect for dog-lovers too!!"}, {"userName": "Jacqueline", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2999717-jacqueline", "userReview": "I enjoyed this addition to the Fools Gold story line. The story was well written. The plot made sense and moved along with no slow spots.I enjoyed the hero. I liked the way he was so socially inept. He was an interesting mixture of self assurance as a surgeon and his belief that he deserved or could inspire love.The heroine was a nice girl. I did feel like the set up of having her be a person who messes up all the time was just given a nod and then dropped. She was however pretty grown up in her reactions to loving a man she knew wouldn't stay. She was willing to take the pain she knew would come later in order to experience the joy their love affair would bring.I really enjoyed all the parts about the therapy dogs. I learned a lot about the ways they are used to help people and the dogs seemed written realistically.I'm not a huge fan of small town stories because I think they tend to be idealized a bit too much and people seem to be nicer than would be true in real life. Living in a small town doesn't make you nice. There are just as many nasty unpleasant people in small towns as anywhere else.

Its part of a series but I read it as standalone and didn't feel like I missed anything. The heroine was a rational down-to-earth woman who felt like she could be someone I knew. She did everything naturally and I'm glad she didn't martyr herself too much- it just seemed like a normal reaction any woman would have when you have to deal with self-confidence issues (ie her hangups about her previous relationships). The hero was pretty angsty but he wasn't that much of a jerk so I really understood his pain and his need to constantly be moving around to escape.Although it was a little on the kumbaya side with the whole town pitching in and everything I still enjoyed reading this book and might pick up others from this author."}], "description": "Montana Hendrix has found her calling\u0097working with therapy dogs.
