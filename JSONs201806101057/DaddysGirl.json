Part of this media is literature. Daddy\u2019s Girl by Charlotte Vale Allen is a story based on autobiographical truths and far surpasses that produced by a mere active imagination. Daddy\u2019s Girl was published in 1980 when the subject of incest was still cloaked in the closet of unspeakable subjects. The book is rather chaotically written (starting in the past and jumping in time continuously without either warning or preamble) which makes it sometimes difficult for the reader to follow. As the story advances and the reader has time to reflect, this chaos becomes more understandable. When one considers this subject so close to and still very emotionally violator to the author, this structural pandemonium is understandable. To me, what makes this story so appalling, horrific and depressing, is realizing that this is (to the outside world) as normal as those next door.Writing this book has reportedly helped the author to recover the remnants of life and might help or inspire others along this same path. The rest of the readers will help bring this closet subject out of the dark shadows and into the light."}, {"userName": "Gabby ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1715901-gabby", "userReview": "Normally I like Charlotte Vale Allen's books. Even though the subject of this book is parental sexual, physical, and mental abuse (so \"like\" isn't exactly the word I'd use to describe it), Vale's writing is what has always drawn me into her stories. That didn't happen with [Daddy's Girl:]. I think the reason for that is because the book just doesn't have much credibility.It has to be very difficult to write about the horrendous abusive situations Charlotte Vale Allen describes since she claims these were personal experiences. The problem is that there are so many gaps and holes in her story, it's almost impossible to believe her. Had this book been published today rather than in the 1980's, I believe all kinds of comparisons would be made between Allen and James Frey. In Allen's case, the problem is not embellishments so much as it is setting up event after event that is unrealistic in the details, or outright impossible to believe because the description has no logic.The subject matter contained in [Daddy's Girl:] is quite intense. I bought this book years ago, and at the time I believed I was simply picking up another Vale Allen book; I didn't realize this was her personal story in which she reveals the terrible offenses her father and her mother inflicted on her until I began reading it. I probably wouldn't have bought the book if I'd known the extent to which the subject matter was handled. However, I do think books like this one can be helpful to people who have suffered similar experiences in their lives. They also serve to educate people so we're more aware of what may be happening to our children. There was no element of connection on any scale I got from reading this story. The blurbs inside the book congratulate Vale Allen for having the courage to tell this story. I'd agree with that sentiment if any part of the book had been plausible."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2394574-andrea", "userReview": "I am not sure how I came across this book, but I found an autographed copy at a bookstore many many years ago. I have read it and it breaks my heart to read anything that has to do with child abuse. It is good to be aware that not all is as it should be and makes me grateful for the great life I do have with my family and children."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143983-louise", "userReview": "The true and harrowing story of Ms. Allen's life of incest. Betrayed by her own father who told her to \"keep the secret\". The suffering and sadness her father placed upon her is totally unforgivable! A great amount of courage and honesty on Ms. Allen's part for writing her true story is applauded for bringing to lite an all too often tragedy in our society."}, {"userName": "Sharon Jackson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3226192-sharon-jackson", "userReview": "I believe I have read all of Charlotte Vale Allen's books, most of them I read back in the 1980's and 1990's.

I honestly can't say I liked it, because who \"likes\" a book about child abuse.

The life that is recounted in Daddy's Girl is harrowing, yet the memoir is distinguished by Allen's heroic efforts to rescue and support herself, by herself. This memoir emphasizes - in addition to a commitment not to live life as a \"walking wound\" - the power of language.Allen has always believed in the potency of words; she began writing as a child, and used notes to communicate with women she admired. She began writing fiction in order to get Daddy's Girl published, which supports the idea (central to confessional writers), that the self may be transformed by the self-in-writing.", "title": "Daddy's Girl", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/261292.Daddy_s_Girl", "average": 3.76, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387734971l/261292.jpg", "reviews": 13, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/81795.Charlotte_Vale_Allen", "name": "Charlotte Vale Allen"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Biography", "True Story"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/261292.Daddy_s_Girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5163999-daddy-s-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2809534-daddy-s-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/698609.Night_Magic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/650080.Parting_Gifts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/551955.Fresh_Air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1434969.Dreaming_in_Color", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/551956.Somebody_s_Baby"]}
