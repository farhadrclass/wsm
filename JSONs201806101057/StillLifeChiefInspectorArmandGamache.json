A blurb (or a review, I forget which) compares her to Agatha Christie, which I suppose could be true, only it's a version of Christie that was being paid by the word and operates only inside people's heads, which really isn't Christie at all. Consider Christie's brief character description from Crooked House about Uncle Roger, an emotional gentle giant: \u201cHe collided with a screen, said \u2018I beg your pardon\u2019 to it in a flustered manner, and went out of the room. It was rather like the exit of a bumble bee and left a noticeable silence behind it.\u201d In Still Life, we get characters musing: \"The studio was growing cold and Clara wondered whether Peter, sitting across the hall in his own studio was also cold. He would almost certainly, she thought with a twang of envy, be working too hard to notice. He never seemed to suffer from the uncertainty that could freeze her, leave her stuck and frozen in place. He just kept putting one foot in front of the other, producing his excruciatingly detailed works that sold for thousands in Montreal. It took him months to do each piece, he was so painfully precise and methodical. She'd given him a roller for his birthday one year and told him to paint faster. He didn't seem to appreciate the joke. Perhaps because it wasn't entirely a joke.\"  Goodness, no wonder I kept falling asleep. There is a great deal of telling and hardly any showing. Dialogue is employed when it comes time to discover items of significance or sum up progress. Inspector Gamache, who I liked strictly because his name bears a resemblance to 'ganache,' holds an informal inquest and meets with all the villagers togther, reviewing the circumstances of the death. Later, he convenes with his team, reviewing clues brainstorming solutions. For those who fell asleep earlier, it's a nice chance to catch up.The plot is fine; nothing unusual. It is possibly even a bit predictable--as I've mentioned before, if I can figure out what the mystery is, it must be relatively simple. I did like a development near the end that further fleshed out a character. However, many of the characters were one note: the urbane gay couple that ran a bistro and whose main conversation seemed to be joking about being gay; the petulant, money-grabbing niece; the caustic village witch--I mean 'poet.' There was also a junior detective whose characterization was particularly strange. I thought perhaps she was involved to block a crucial plot point, but I think I was wrong. Overall, I'd have to say the Christie comparison wears thin. It's not that Christie wouldn't have had weak characters, just that in her best works they would have felt a little less farcical.Overall though, it's a nice little study of the small village of Three Pines in Quebec, and of the talented Inspector and his team. A bit too pastoral for my own tastes, it's a bit more like a painting of a haystack at sunset instead of a group of women dancing. To combat the sleepies I started reading from the end, hoping to find a strong finish that would invigorate me (it's kind of like hopscotch, a chapter or two, then flip back further). And while it did, I have no real interest in re-reading.I'll give the next couple a try, because my mom wants to give them a go and because my friends seem to enjoy the series. Of course, your own mileage may vary. Note that it won a first book award or two.Two, two-and-a-half stars."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26175098-christine", "userReview": "4.5 starsWith the encouragement of several of my Goodreads friends, I finally decided to pick up Still Life, a novel I bought 3 years ago. I don\u2019t know why I waited so long to dust it off, especially since it has won multiple awards, but I can tell you it won\u2019t take 3 years for me to read book 2 of what I believe will be a highly enjoyable series.Some readers called this a cozy. I respectfully disagree; I think this story is more in the category of literary mystery. There is so much depth. The setting is a small village nestled somewhere in Quebec, not terribly far from Montreal. Three Pines is inhabited by a somewhat quirky group of people who have layers upon layers of interpersonal relationships. Having no local detective, the town calls in Chief Inspector Armand Gamache from Montreal when a woman is killed\u2014was it an accident or murder? I have fallen in love with this guy. He is not your usual law enforcement protagonist with demons seeping out of his pores. In fact, he seems very well adjusted and even has a wonderful relationship with his wife (we just get a peek at the latter and I am hoping to see more of Armand\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s marital relationship in future books). Armand is highly intelligent, extremely perceptive, kind and gentle, yet firm and no nonsense when called for. His integrity is impeccable. I also became quite fond of his right hand man, Jean Guy Beauvoir. Overall, characterization is excellent, but not quite strong enough to pull me hook line and sinker into the lives of the villagers, perhaps only because of the sheer number of players. I do feel that Ms. Penny\u2019s writing is such that this will come with later installments as we get to know the townfolk better. The plot is engaging and had me changing my mind right and left regarding whom the baddie was. I never did get it right. I did have to suspend belief just a bit regarding the intricacies of the crime, but this didn\u2019t lessen my enjoyment of the journey.I enjoyed this novel more than my usual 4-star reads, but I have a feeling Ms. Perry is going to get better and better. Thus, the round down from 4.5 to 4 stars.Will I continue with the series? Absolutely. Do I recommend Still Life? I sure do\u2014to all readers of crime fiction interested in something a little different and with emphasis on characterization."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Film ReviewBook Rating: 4.5* of fiveThe Publisher Says: Winner of the New Blood Dagger, Arthur Ellis, Barry, Anthony, and Dilys awards.Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec and his team of investigators are called in to the scene of a suspicious death in a rural village south of Montr\u00e9al and yet a world away. Jane Neal, a long-time resident of Three Pines, has been found dead in the woods. The locals are certain it\u2019s a tragic hunting accident and nothing more but Gamache smells something foul this holiday season\u2026and is soon certain that Jane died at the hands of someone much more sinister than a careless bowhunter.With this award-winning first novel, Louise Penny introduces an engaging hero in Inspector Gamache, who commands his forces\u2014and this series\u2014with power, ingenuity, and charm.My Review: Oh, the raptures of a first novel that also inaugurates a mystery series! It's like your first piece of birthday cake as a kid...OMIGOD this is good wait whaddaya mean I gotta wait another whole year to get another one you stink and you're mean *waaahIwantmymommy*But crafty old fifty-plussers like moi wait. We lurk behind the bakery, sniffing the ineffable esters of birthday cakes destined for the inexperienced and the impatient and the indiscriminate, mentally filing away those scents most closely followed by moans and slurps of ecstasy, biding our time and hoarding our book-calories (aka money) to see which annual yumyums consistently produce those sounds and smells.Here it is, ladies and what-all-else, the first birthday cake from Canadian cake-baker Louise Penny, and my GOD was it worth the wait!A friend sent this to me as a Christmas gift. It came after self-same friend raved and jumped up and down and yodeled the praises of the series, featuring Inspector Gamache of the Quebec Surete (I can't help myself, I hear Gestapo jackboots and Euro-sirens every time I see that word) and the odd, off-kilter inhabitants of Three Pines, Quebec. I was practically panting with eagerness to get this package, which when it arrived proved to contain *several* of the Gamache series.Being a good Virgo, I snatched up the first in the series, and applied eyes to page. Steadily. For four hours. I was 2/3 through with the book then, and *forced* myself to put it down because a) I had to walk the dog, b) I had to feed my 91-yr-old aunt, and c) I had to pee.Let's talk about mystery series for a minute. I like them, as readers of past reviews will yawningly recall, because they satisfy my need for order, for the world to work *right* for a change. I think a lot of people feel similarly to me. But a series, iteration upon iteration of similar plots/characters/motivations/dialogue...what makes a well-read consumer of Lit'rachure such as I, and so many fellow Goodreadsers, am/are seek these books out? Comfort? Yes, but... Ease? Yes, but... Quality.Some of the best storytelling going on in literature today happens in mysteries and thrillers.Yeup, you can love or loathe Grisham's writing, but you CANNOT fault, in any way, his eye for a story. You can fairly say it's not to your personal taste, but don't even TRY to say it's \"not good.\" Likewise James Patterson, Stephen King, Iris Johansen, et alii. There is a reason these folks are bestsellers, and it is NOT that the People got no taste. It's that these are storytellers, entertainers, creators of worlds we-the-people want to inhabit if only for a moment.As was Homer, may I remind the snobs. No one thought much about Homer's stuff, except that it was rollicking good fun. Nobody even bothered to write it down for a few centuries *after* writing was invented. Somewhere on the Times bestseller list is the work of the Homer our culture will be remembered for, and it's not likely to be Faulkner. (Horrible thought: What if it's HEMINGWAY?!?)Louise Penny's Three Pines is a place I want to go and stay, eating Gabri's bounteous cooking and flirting with Olivier and lusting from afar at unattainable Peter and gossiping unkindly with Ruth...then settling in for a long, quiet snifter with Gamache and Beauvoir and Clara, to think it all through and come to a reasoned conclusion about life. I am there with these people, these words-on-page creations that have the life only a deep well of talent can water into existence. I believe them. I think you will, too.I offer this moment from very near the end of the book, when Clara realizes who murdered her very best friend: Clara stared at her reflection in the window of {the victim}'s kitchen. A ghostly,frightened woman looked back. Her theory made sense. Ignore it, the voice inside said. It's not your business. Let the police do their work. For God's sake, don't say anything. It was a seductive voice, one that promised peace and calm and the continuation of her beautiful life in Three Pines. To act on what she knew would destroy that life.What if you're wrong? cooed the voice. You'll hurt a lot of people...But Clara knew the voice lied. Had always lied to her. Clara would know and that knowing would eventually destroy her life anyway.If that doesn't make you sprint out to get this book, nothing else I can say will.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Rating: 2.5* of fiveThe Filmmaker Says: When a beloved schoolteacher is found dead, the possibility of murder leaves the quaint town of Three Pines aghast in this crime drama based on the award-winning novel by Louise Penny. The Film at Acorn.tvThe Film Review: Well now. I don't know what cause Louise Penny to distance herself from the film made of her first novel, and so far as I am aware, she hasn't been public about the cause of her breach with the filmmakers.The only actor I recognized in the cast was Gamache, played by Nathaniel Parker. I had a dizzy moment or two when I first saw Peter Morrow, playd by one Gabriel Hogan. I was sure as sure could be that it was Henry Rollins with a bad dye-job and after a facelift. Then I wondered if permaybehaps Mr. Hogan was, errrmmm, a product of Rollins' rock-star years...no, born in 1973...so no go....And do you now see the problem? I was able to trace these arabesques and follow these fancies because I was so very not wrapped up in the film. Parker does a rather blah job as Gamache, the lady who plays Clara is nothing special, we don't so much as hear BOO from Myrna, Gabri and Olivier appear to be acquaintances with a formal past. And then there are the police: Lacoste looks just right and isn't terribly busy onscreen, Jean-Guy is edgeless, but then there's Agent Nicol. She's perfectly cast for attitude, is Susanna Fournier. Manages to be just like Nicol in the book.Whatever the alchemy is that makes a film adaptation great is missing from this one. It's pretty to look at. The actors aren't bloody awful in the roles. The screenplay has the events in order. And at the end of the 88 minutes, I was utterly uninterested in seeing more.Bad, bad sign.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Candi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi", "userReview": "\"Three Pines wasn\u2019t on any tourist map, being too far off any main or even secondary road. Like Narnia, it was generally found unexpectedly and with a degree of surprise that such an elderly village should have been hiding in this valley all along. Anyone fortunate enough to find it once usually found their way back.\"I\u2019ve seen this book and others in the Chief Inspector Armand Gamache series pop up so many times in my friends\u2019 reviews and lists. And yet, I hesitated to read it for some time since I didn\u2019t really consider myself a \u2018series reader\u2019 any longer. I felt that if I got hooked on a series, I would get \u2018tied down\u2019 and feel like I would have to set aside too many other wonderful books in order to continue with a series. Well, I\u2019ve since become older and wiser, and series are no longer a thing of the past but another delightful option in a world where I can read whatever I want, whenever I choose! I\u2019ve started several series over the past year or two, and have had my eye on this one for some time now thanks to the favorable feedback of many Goodreads\u2019 friends. Having read this first in the series, I have to say I\u2019m in for the long haul! I won\u2019t rush through them, since as I mentioned, there are so many books yet to be read \u2013 but I plan to commit fully!The village of Three Pines is so charming \u2013 as in the quote above, I believe I am one of those folks who have found it and am hoping to be fortunate enough to find my way back. I\u2019m not sure that Louise Penny intended that for me, but I\u2019m reading into it that way regardless ;) I loved the descriptions of the little town, the surroundings, and the somewhat quirky characters. Sent to investigate the death of a gentle old soul named Jane Neal, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache from the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Quebec is respectable, intelligent and a true gentleman. Such an appealing leading man all around. I am eager to learn more about him in the next several books. It seems no one would ever want to deliberately harm Jane \u2013 or would they? Inspector Gamache will do what he does best \u2013 listen and watch by inserting himself smack dab in the middle of the goings-on \u2013 in order to determine if her death was an accident or *gasp* a murder! \"Before his eyes the village of Three Pines seemed to slow right down. The insistence of life, the bustle and energy became muffled. The voices dropped, gaits slowed. Gamache sat back and did what he did best. He watched.\"The cast of characters is quite entertaining, and I enjoyed getting to know each of them \u2013 even the not so pleasant ones I would likely sidestep in real life! Jean Guy Beauvoir, Gamache\u2019s second in command, is another I am keen to watch develop further in later installments, and the pair make for a satisfying duo. I loved popping in at the bistro to see what everyone was eating and drinking, visiting the quaint little bookshop \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t love that!, getting a glimpse inside some of the resident homes, and traipsing around in the local woods. Louise Penny also touches on some Quebecois culture which I hope she expands upon in later books, as this is an aspect that really appeals to me as well. Despite the idyllic aura of Three Pines, there are some complex relationships and dark secrets that draw the reader further into the intrigue. A well-written and delightful debut, Still Life is one I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend to anyone that loves a good little mystery set in captivating surroundings with very pleasing characterizations. 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "I am a little sad that I can't give Still Life more than 2 stars. It was recommended to me and it's not a pleasant task to trash someone's suggestion, but what can I do, this book was just a barely OK read for me.Still Life is a traditional (\"cozy\") mystery set in a Canadian village Three Pines. One Sunday morning a body of 76-year old Jane Neal - a long-time resident of the village - is found. At first, it appears that Jane was killed in a hunting accident, but later we find out that quite a few seemingly ordinary and upstanding villagers have some secrets to hide and maybe reasons to murder the old lady.On a positive side, I enjoyed learning a little about Quebec. I personally never knew that there was a tension between Quebec and the rest of Canada and also a lot of friction between francophones and anglophones. Archery/hunting details were interesting as well. And, the most exciting thing, I could practice my newly acquired basic French skills - I even knew what boulangerie was!As for the rest, the book didn't live up to my expectations. Poor characterization simply killed the story for me. The characters were drawn in a strange way and their back stories were introduced awkwardly. I couldn't understand their motivations and actions. Too often they acted immaturely (Yvette Nichol) or weirdly hysterical (Clara Morrow, Yolande). Dialog was very stilted at times too, often I had no idea what people were talking about and why they found certain things funny.I suppose I should have cut Louise Penny some slack, it was her first novel after all. But the book was rather poorly written even for the first effort. I am surprised Still Life managed to receive so much critical recognition and mainly positive Goodreads ratings. Did the mystery standards go down since Agatha Christie's death? I guess the success of this book is the biggest mystery to me..."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "This was a pleasure to read.

Her loss was so apparent in her latest offering, The Great Reckoning. As I turned the initial pages of this first book in the series, Still Life, I came upon the Acknowledgements that almost made me weep:\"This is for my husband Michael, who has created a life for us full of love and kindness. He allowed me to quit my job, pretend to write, then gave me unstinting praise even when what I produced was drivel. I've realised that anyone can be a critic but it takes a remarkable person to offer praise. Michael is that person.\" So you see, more than just words have gone on every page by Louise Penny. Far, far more.Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Surete du Quebec is introduced to us in Still Life as well as the tiny village of Three Pines. When an elderly former teacher has been found dead along a woodsy path, shock reverberates throughout the village. Was this a careless hunting accident or was there something more sinister going on? If so, who could ever have wanted the kindly Jane Neal dead?As you enter into an Armand Gamache book, you will pull back on the reins and slow the pace. Your eyes adjust to finite observations and attention to detail. Gamache's eyes sweep over every gesture, every careless article, and every door ajar. He tunes into every bit of dialogue with the words: \"Tell me about it.\" And each storyline of every book in the series will sharpen your own sensitivities and your own sharpened skills.The truth is hard-hitting in Three Pines. One of their own is responsible in some way for Jane's death. Houses left unlocked at night soon become fortresses. Fear permeates like heavy smoke. Gamache brings along his trusted inspectors. They will soon discover that Three Pines will give up, unwillingly, multi-layered secrets. You will also meet the main characters who weave their way throughout the series.......the heart and the core of Louise Penny's offerings.Still Life begins the journey and is a must read to set the stage. The following books will grow in intensity, subject matter, character development, and heavy-duty crime. The Inspector Gamache Series is certainly not fluff as you will discover. It will expose you to the dastardly deeds at the hands of the respected and the not-so-respected of humanity.

I like to throw in a few of these every once in a while for variety. After all, one does not wish to consider oneself effete for having dined on too rich a diet of purely literary fare, does one? Now that we're in the star bestowal business I thought for a minute about what makes for a good book of this sort.

Chief Inspector Armand Gamache qualifies as interesting in that wise and avuncular way that inspires confidence. It\u2019s set in Quebec in a French and English speaking town south of Montreal. The local flavor was delicieux. As far as the forensics are concerned, there were some bits involving bowhunting that were out of the ordinary. This was Penny\u2019s first book, but she seemed very polished in the way she set the stage and kept us guessing. As you\u2019ve no doubt already gathered from my list, I did have a problem with one of the characters on the investigative team. She seemed almost willfully obtuse. If the goal was to create conflict to foil the naturally unflappable Inspector Gamache, there had to have been more satisfying ways to do it than through her. Even so, the book has enough charm, intrigue and local color to recommend. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "Clara \"laughed until she thought she would piddle,\" and I want to piddle on this book.

I was recommended this author by a friend who is a great admirer of Ian Rankin and Stieg Larsson, so I was quite excited as I set out. Excitement soon turned to disappointment, followed by a sense of disbelief that writing so bad could be so well received by the reading public. And indeed win a prize, albeit one for novice crime writers.The setting is an idyllic village near Montreal, populated with a cast of caricatures - aging bohemian artists, a famous but misanthropic poet, a retired black psychologist, a gay couple who run, guess what, the bistro and bed and breakfast. I could continue. The hero inspector is an intelligent, intuitive and caring man who spends what little free time he has helping his wife stuff partridges with wild rice in the kitchen of his trendy Montreal apartment. His second-in-command is almost indistinguishable from him. By way of contrast we have some rough poor people, and a handful of one dimensional, over the top, emotionally challenged characters. All the nice people run around eating fragrant, freshly baked rolls stuffed with warm brie and black forest ham, while dabbling in solving the murder which has only ever so slightly ruffled the peace and tranquility of their lives. There is an abundance of golden leaves and drifting woodsmoke.The plot is disjointed, the pace is tediously slow, the characters are drawn with strokes so thick you can't make them out, the writing is seldom good and sometimes painfully bad. According to the cover, there was actually an editor. This is a book with very few redeeming features, other than the occasional telling description and flash of humour. Whodunnit? I really didn't care enough to find out."}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "Still LifeMy discovery of the charming, picturesque Canadian fictional village of Three Pines comes a few years too late, but I am glad I finally decided to pay a visit. Before reading Still Life I only had a casual idea of what a \"cozy murder mystery\" was. Once you read this novel however, you can see how that moniker perfectly describes this novel and Mrs. Penny's writing style.The title, Still Life, also describes the idyllic, low-key lifestyle the residents of Three Pines have been accustomed to. Unfortunately for them their way of life comes to a screeching halt when one of their most beloved citizens is found dead under suspicious circumstances.The victim is Jane Neal, a middle-age retired school teacher. Her body is found in the woods near the village. At the beginning it appears that she was the victim of an unfortunate hunting accident but nobody knows for sure. As a slow pace investigation unravels, we are introduced to Armand Gamache of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec. In his mid-50's, the Chief Inspector of Homicide has a reputation for being a smart, honest investigator. With one glaring exception, he brings with him a group of experienced detectives who are determined to find out what really happened to Jane.We also get to know a long colorful cast of townsfolk, including Clara and Peter Morrow, both of whom are local artists; Olivier and Gabri are gay partners who own and run a bistro and a bed and breakfast, Myrna Landers is a former psychologist who makes a living selling used books and Ben Hadley, who has been Peter Morrow's close friend for years. I found the paced of the story and the mystery behind it, engaging and entertaining.But mostly what kept my interest was learning about the the idiosyncrasies of the region and the bi-cultural aspect of life in Qu\u00e9bec. The quirky references to the differences between French and English culture made for some funny, light-hearted moments.So question for my Goodreads friends, since there are so many books already published on this series, is it necessary to read them in order, or is it okay to skip a few? I would appreciate any recommendations about what book to read next.Finally I should say that it is a breath of fresh air to get to know a character of so much integrity and as straightforward as Inspector Gamache. Overall this was a very entertaining read, I look forward to visiting him and the Three Pines village in the near future."}, {"userName": "Holly  B", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39749481-holly-b", "userReview": "3.5The first book of 13 in the Armand Gamache series.

There is quite a cast of characters in this one and Inspector Gamache is quite humorous, compassionate, and wise! I look forward to getting to know him better. If you enjoy detective/police procedural series that have a \"cozy\" feel and are well-written, you may want to give this one a try.

Rather than actively pursuing their hopes and dreams, they wait for good things to come to them.Miss Jane Neal was possibly one of those people for much of her life. She fancied herself an artist, although none had ever seen her work. In fact, no one had ever been beyond the kitchen of her home, yet she was well liked, even loved, by many. Finally she is moved to enter one of her works in a juried art show; days later, she is found dead. Her death appears to have been an accident, but could it be murder? If so, who could possibly want this kindly former teacher dead, and why?Enter Chief Inspector Gamache. Since the town has no detective of its own, Gamache is called in from the Surete du Quebec in Montreal. He\u2019s an old hand at investigating suspicious deaths, and he has his top assistant, Jean Guy Beauvoir, with him. Unfortunately, he\u2019s also been assigned a fledgling agent, Yvette Nichol. She has potential; with her brains and powers of observation, she could be an asset to the team one day. Not yet, however. She manages to alienate Gamache, other officers, and townsfolk with her attitude. Gamache settles in and slowly surveys the lay of the land. He gets to know the people and what drives them. He doesn\u2019t seem to be in a rush; rather, he talks to people, and he listens. Then he sits at a table in the B&B and welcomes anyone who has anything to tell him. He bounces ideas off Beauvoir and Jane\u2019s friends, sort of reminiscent of an Agatha Christie style detective.The pace bothered me at first. I was coming off a fast-paced, highly suspenseful book, and this had anything but a whirlwind of activity. The first half was mostly quite sleepy, and I found myself stuck re-reading the same page on multiple occasions. I did appreciate the scenery, the humor, and the depth of character development, however. It felt a bit too casual at times, more like a slice of life than a murder investigation.Yet, I was intrigued. I suspected it had to do with the painting that Jane called Fair Day. Was I right? Even if I guessed right, that is still quite a puzzle to work out. The murderer did not turn out to be whom I hoped it would be, which tells me that I was invested in the story. Did I love it? No. But I was engaged enough to read another one, and I think that says something about Ms. Penny\u2019s writing and about her characters. I will be picking up A Fatal Grace sometime in the not-too-distant future.3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Mary Beth *Traveling Sister*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14233569-mary-beth-traveling-sister", "userReview": "I finally get the chance to read this series, I've heard nothing but good things about this series.

The author describes this place so well that I actually felt that I was there visiting with these odd characters. Three Pines is the place to be! This book is very well written and has won many awards.  The mystery starts out with Jane, who was 76 years old and was a school teacher and she was found dead in the woods of Three Pines.

Upon his arrival he discovers that nearly everyone he meets could be a suspect, and the investigation is immediately underway. But this isn\u2019t your traditional hard-and-fast crime novel. It\u2019s much cozier and focuses on the lives of the many\u2014and I mean many\u2014villagers that we meet throughout the novel.I enjoyed that the novel broke from the normal constraints of the genre to give us a deeper glimpse into these characters\u2019 lives. The struggle between children and parents or husbands and wives, discussions of race and sexuality, and the ambition of a young detective who\u2019s on the case with Gamache all enrich the story. However, it\u2019s still a 300 page mystery novel that has to deliver on a compelling case and keep you guessing. While it delivered on that, I felt perhaps there were a few too many characters to keep track of; I\u2019d find myself at times stopping to think, \u201cwait, who is Matthew? Or Suzanne? And which one was Myrna again?\u201d since there is an ensemble of at least 15-20 characters that you get introduced to right out of the gate.Nonetheless, I enjoyed myself while reading this and recognize that this is Penny\u2019s debut novel.

She had been shot with an arrow. Surely the victim of a hunting accident. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec and his team are called to investigate the death. Over the course of the investigation we get to meet the residents of this normally quiet little village. Olivier and Gabri; a gay couple who run a bistro and a bed and breakfast, Myrna Landers; a former psychologist who now owns a bookshop, Ruth Zardo; an eccentric poet, Clara Morrow; artist and friend of Jane's, Clara's husband Peter; also an artist. These are just a handful of the wonderful residents of Three Pines. People you wouldn't mind sitting down with at the bistro and enjoying a meal or just a cup of coffee.But not everyone is who they appear to be and the village is not as idyllic as it may outwardly appear. Early in the book Olivier and Gabri are victims of a vicious assault by three boys who mock the pair's sexual orientation. A family is in turmoil. Their 14 year old son is suspected of being one of the boys involved in the assault. He had been a happy boy and a good student. Now he is sullen and rebellious. Could it be because of drugs? And of course the death of Jane Neal was not a hunting accident. She was murdered. Why? What harm could a 76 year old retired school teacher be to anyone? Everyone loved her and had nothing but kind things to say. Inspector Gamache is very patient man. He will meet the residents of Three Pines and get to know them. He and his team will learn who is behind the murder of Jane Neal.Definitely recommend reading this book.

Her mudroom was a museum, her kitchen a shrine. That was as far as anybody was allowed into her home. Even her most dearest friends never made it beyond the kitchen. The status quo would have lingered on forever, if it wasn't for Jane submitting, for the first time in her life, one of her paintings, ' Fair Day', to the Annual Williamsburg Arts Exhibition. It was the only piece of herself that she finally wanted to share with the world. Some judges were horrified, others were delighted. And somewhere in between someone probably got scared. \u2018For whatever reason, Fair Day challenges us. It moves us. To anger,\u2019 here Elise acknowledged Iren\u00e9e, \u2018to confusion,\u2019 a brief but meaningful look at Henri who nodded his grizzled head slightly, \u2018to \u2026\u2019 a glance at Peter and Clara. \u2018Joy,\u2019 said Peter at the very moment Clara said, \u2018Sorrow.\u2019 They looked at each other and laughed. \u2018Now, I look at it and feel, like Henri, simply confused. The truth is I don\u2019t know whether Fair Day is a brilliant example of naive art, or the pathetic scrawling of a superbly untalented, and delusional, old woman. That\u2019s the tension. And that\u2019s why it must be part of the show. I can guarantee you it\u2019s the one work people will be talking about in the cafes after the vernissage.\u2019Ruth Zardo, a woman who were known to be scarier than a burning building, thought it was hideous.It was suddenly all too clear that Jane did not write a diary. No, she painted her life story, as well as those of the villagers, into canvasses nobody was allowed to ever see. Myrna was saying to Clara. \u2018Even the deaths, accidents, funerals, bad crops, even they have a kind of life. She (Jane) made them natural.\u2019Although she was old, Jane was also gentle and kind. And fearless too. When a gay couple were harassed in the small town of Three Pines, south of Qu\u00e9bec, Jane not only confronted the three young boys, she also recognized them. The three young assailants fled. One of them, with the orange mask, left behind a laugh so foul it even eclipsed the duck manure they just finished throwing at Olivier and Gabri.However, before Jane Neal could enjoy the triumph of her first exhibition, she was dead. A hunting accident, the sleepy town believed.It would have been accepted as true, if Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Quebec\u2019, with his two assistants, Inspector Jean Guy Beauvoir and Agent Yvette Nichol, was not summoned to the scene. The town hall was packed when he announced his theory. A silence deader than Jane, ascended onto the gathering.  'Even the coughing stopped, miraculously cured by curiosity.' Comments: Like a good murder mystery, the plot is everything, allowing the dedicated reader of this genre to try and solve the mystery before the detective does. For us it is more than just a story. It is a game. We revel in the sleuths, the puzzle, and the resolution of the case at the end of the book. We simply demand those thrills as readers, yes! Still Life did not fall into the trap of getting bogged down in history or back flashes, or going off on a tangent. These elements were present in the book, but never inspired me to skip-read as with many other books in this genre. What better way of spending a winter's weekend, curled up in front of an old-fashioned fire , enveloped in warm blankets and cocooned in a nest of big fluffy soft cushions! In our quest for more murders, clues and suspicious persons, a first novel, such as  Still Life honors the thrilling, joyful experience of classic authors such as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Julien Barnes, Eric Ambler, Dorothy Slayers, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Agatha Christie to name but a few. As a first novel, it was perfect. The plot point was plausible, keeping the action moving, the murder was believable; the culprit was able to commit the crime; the researched was very well done; the ending was unpredictable enough. Of course the addition of unexpected twists to throw us off the scent, was applied, and the detectives themselves got tricked! The gentle, laid-back style worked for me. It was more than a murder mystery. It was a multi-layered tale of human relationships within a warm, close-knit community. Dignity and grace comes to mind. Sometimes we want to be strapped to a chair, gagged and scared to death! Sometimes we just want a good ole inspector Morse, or Hercule Poirot and the all-time famous Sherlock Holmes to entertain us. Nothing beats the combination of good detective work, scientific solutions and the use of plain common sense to grace our imaginations. This multiple-award winning book is one of those. I was mesmerized and thrilled to read it, and ultimately sad to close the book. I loved being part of the Three Pines community. I felt like leaving behind my own friends. And that, in my humble opinion, makes this book a winner in its own right! It is the first book in a series.
