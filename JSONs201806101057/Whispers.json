I love the intense adrenalin laced stories, So eh, call me a thrill seeker.Koontz did a great job with his characters, I learned a lot about them accept for Bruno. You really don't get to know too much about him at the beginning of the story. I felt like I kinda had to throw pieces together to make it all work together. I would have liked to know a little more at the beginning, but then again it also built the anticipation up the closer I got to the real deal.The story kinda a stalled a little bit for me. It lost that intensity that I was really enjoying throughout the whole story. But it takes the reader to a deep dark side where they get immersed into the tale of Katherine and Bruno and the sick story that lies within. What really happened to this big happy family. It was quite enjoyable watching their separate story unfold. Like a story within a story. You could feel Bruno's nightmare right along with his mothers to the point where it is almost unbearable to imagine it. Koontz wraps up the story with a great ending I think. It kinda left me feeling like I did not know how to feel about Bruno or his mother. Even though I knew they are raving psychotic lunatics, they weren't born that way, they were introduced to it, forced to live it. Koontz was able to make me feel all kinds of emotions while reading this one and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Whispers..."}, {"userName": "Fred", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22594333-fred", "userReview": "Koontzland Group Read - March 2018\nA nice scene is with the bartender, Otto showing all violent customers with his beer glass biting stunt to keep them quiet (e.g. Bobby).

I watched a Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon movie though, where Morgan Freeman is portraying Nelson Mandela, and while touring the prison where he was held captive, or while talking to Matt Damon about how important winning a sporting event is for a country's sense of validity, he mentions a poem he had memorized. A few lines of a poem, or a whole poem, I don't remember. Apparently it was profound enough and simple enough that repetition and monotony never decreased its relevance to Mandela's fate. I think that, true or not, is a good little story.Whispers is a long, obscene, vulgar and predictable swim through a mile of shit. I spent a day and a half reading it, and felt so cheated at the end, walking out my door and seeing a beautiful sunset and calm, quiet evening.

'Whispers' was my fourth Dean Koontz novel and like the case with all them before; I finished reading and was sitting on the proverbial fence. I'm more familiar with his more recent works, 'Innocence', '77 Shadow Street'. After reading them and being left disappointed, a friend of mine - another book buddy who's a fan of Koontz suggested I try some of his earlier novels. And being the type of reader who will try anything once, I thought, why not? That is how 'Whispers' come into the game. Why I choose it out of the numerous other options offered up by Koontz, I have no idea. It was voted in as a group read in my book club, so that's the main reason I read it. It's more a psychological thriller mystery combo than a horror novel. Though I will say there are a few pages near the end of the story where bugs are very much up front and center. Talk about giving a person a case of the heebie-jeebies. This book isn't the most terrible book out there. The characters were blah, the writing just mediocre, but the suspense was there. Hey, I managed to finish, so it can't be that bad. Besides, I'm on a mission. I haven't given up on Mr. Koontz yet.

The plot isn't one that's terrifically original but it's handled very well and the plot holds together in the face of evidence in the story that \"kind of\" misleads. It's supposed to, and it's done very well. So all in all I think this is a good book and while I can't bring myself to go above 3 stars that only means that I have trouble deciding \"how good\" it is. I don't think it's as good as 4 but it's definitely better than a 2...so, what 3.4????Oh well.This is a book with lots \"identifying with the players\". The scene where she's dealing with the police officer who's got his own baggage and has already made up his mind drove me up the wall and I could imagine the frustration of trying to convince someone who'd already decided you were lying...even though you weren't.So lot's of violence a pretty good set up and Koontz's trademark \"broken villain\". His ability to make you wonder if there's a supernatural element or not is also on display here and done well. I like it.So, while I can't list this as one of Koontz's best it's still a good one and I'd recommend you give it a try and see what you think.Scary at times...a bit of a gross-out at other times dealing with unpleasant subjects but not the worst I've run on by any means. Koontz does deal with unpleasant subjects often so you know that going in...be ready and I don't think it'll surprise.

The underlying mystery of the novel is amazing. I remember finishing the book and feeling as if it had been this intricately wound and knotted yarn that had clues laid perfectly throughout the story and it certainly wasn't something where an author wrote and discovered where the story would lead him. Nope it was intricately and elaborately plotted.It also had one of the best love stories I have ever read.The only thing that doesn't hold up over the passage of time is due to telephone technology. With today's advent of cell phones, answering machines, caller ID, and call blocking it seems as if we have to hark back to the days of horse and buggies to understand how someone could terrorize another by simply making a threatening phone call.Other than that, I think the majority of the story holds up well and it is one of my all time favorites."}, {"userName": "Paul Dinger", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1857158-paul-dinger", "userReview": "It is early Dean Koontz and you can see a lot of what he had to overcome to be the writer he is today. The prose is top heavy, he explains often when he should just describe and it stops the action. The book is heavy with explaination, his villian isn't as chilling as the deranged killer from Hideaway, the twisted doctor from False Memory, or the demented sherieff from Intensity. One misses these pillars of the community turned cold bloodied pyschos, although he is one of their brethern. The Koontz villian typically is proudly a loner who uses murder and/or brutality as a subsitute for imtimacy. His monsters use the shields of their outward forms to better become predators. The killer here doesn't. It also suffers from the obviousness of the killer's idenity. It will occur to you long before it will those who are 'investigating' it. You can see why this would be a device he would rarely use again. This book had obvious flaws, but it also possessed the raw sense of terror, of having your space invaded and then being attacked by a true other, someone who may seem human, but really isn't.

Why did I trudge along and finish it? Well, listening instead of actually being the reader helped a bit. I did want to know how it ended, and for part of the book, the ultimate mystery was a little intriguing. What was the problem? Sooo much.The misogyny. The whole concept of a woman brutally attacked and almost raped with the cops not believing her was disgusting and uncomfortable to read. One cop outright persecutes her while the other, obviously attracted to her, apologetically explains exactly why she isn't taken seriously. When it happens again, she easily forgives the cops and agrees to go on a date. Right. Also, this main character Heroine is always described and admired as so strong...yet all she does is whine. The conjecture. Most of the plot occurs in long dialogue scenes where the characters debate what might be happening. It's like the author basically thinks to himself, \"Here, let me prove that I thought this thing through from all sides so that you cannot roll your eyes about how implausible this is.\" There are tons of \"This doesn't sound possible\" moments followed by lots and lots of discussion between characters deciding that it is possible and then conveniently explaining why. A pattern developed where we would cut to the H/H, having a debate with the woman all scared and whining. Cut to the bad guy, slowly revealing how crazy unhinged he is, although he had his wits about him just fine at first. New chapter, with more of the same discussion but taking place in a new location.

Hilary and Tony know each other for one week - ONE WEEK!! - and they already say \"I love you\" and \"I'd be nothing without you\" (vomit). I'm all for a GOOD romance, but geeze, this is like the crappy Romance novels you pick up at the super market during vacation because you either forgot to bring a book or you already finished (several times) the one you brought.That aside, the serial rapist/murderer was kind of interesting.

Top-notch action, adventure, thrills, and suspense. Interesting settings that totally draw you in and either make you wish you were there, or make you glad you're not. Creepy places to explore. Mysteries to unravel. Strong female characters who take no nonsense yet aren't too clich\u00e9. A wild ride from start to finish. Intriguing (and, for me, amusing) descriptions of things, especially household items (I'm always amused by the food...whenever there is an inventory of food in a Koontz book, there always seem to be Vienna sausages...which totally aren't my thing and I've never actually seen what they look like, though they must be a Koontz favorite since he always talks about those, and fruit and cheese, and wine, etc...) Also there are the recurring themes of loneliness, troubled childhoods, villains with twisted pasts, not so much shades of black and white but a smeared grey at times...as well as visions of the high life, a character with an interest in art, several police officers, a lovable old curmudgeon (I often feel that Joshua Rhinehart, the lawyer in this books, and Garrison Dilworth, the lawyer from Watchers, are like two sides of the same coin...different in personality yet ultimately alike, and makes me wonder if both were derived from a friend or acquaintance in Mr. Koontz's real life, as is often the case with character archetypes who pop up more than once in an author's writing).I liked Hilary and Tony, the protagonists. The way in which they meet seems a bit more realistic than, say, the way that Spencer and Valerie from Dark Rivers of the Heart meet. The theme is the same...two desperately lonely people, one of both of whom are often unable to break down the walls they've built around themselves enough to let someone in, but finally (and painstakingly, and slowly) taking the plunge to actually fall in love.The love part...is a bit too fluffy for my adult senses. As a teenager (especially a lonely teenager who identified with those lonely characters of the Koontz books from the '80s, I'm not ashamed to say) I thought it was wonderful, heady stuff, the way these characters fell in love and formed a team, the two of them against the world. And that part, I still like and appreciate even when I revisit these books as an adult. But all of the \"every day from here on out will be perfect and we're going to spend the rest of our lives attached at the hip\" stuff is...well...overdone and way too saccharine to be believable by today's standards. Are we all too jaded now? Yeah, probably. In 1980, when this book was written, everything in general had a lot more of a romance angle than things do now. Books, movies, etc. It could be a science fiction movie (hello, Terminator) and you can bet there had to be a romance and...(insert exasperated sigh) a bedroom scene, which brings me to my next point.The sex. There was way too much of it. I'm not a prude, and I have nothing wrong with sex in a story, as long as it furthers the story. But come on. Once, maybe twice. If the characters want to do it more than that, we are usually spared having to witness it as readers firsthand. But Hilary and Tony...man. They're like rabbits. And after the second or third time of entire pages devoted to really embarrassing euphemisms about \"becoming one body and one soul\" and even more embarrassing euphemisms for the actual mechanics of the act itself, I was half embarrassed and half, well, grossed out. Most stories in the 21st century don't go into the whole dimly-lit bedroom scene thing because...well...it's absurd and silly! Yeah, I know, this was written in 1980, and again, it was almost expected. But I honestly find myself skipping those pages now (or skipping ahead if I'm listening to the audiobook). More power to Hilary and Tony if they want to spend half their day in the bedroom...describing it once, to emphasize the emotional and physical bond they share, yeah, OK, I get it. But a repetition half a dozen times to drive home - ad nauseam - the same exact sentiment, over and over...it's just...too much.Mr. Koontz got better at that as he became a more experienced writer, I know. And I don't hold any of it against him. He was one of the favorite authors of my teenage years and still one of those I respect a great deal.This isn't really a spoiler because I'm not giving away any of the \"secrets\" (which are quite masterfully written and warrants at least one re-reading to catch all the things you will definitely miss the first time around) but I will just say that the ending is a satisfying climax to the suspense, though in my opinion, a bit too short (especially when comparing it to, say, the ending of Watchers)...Whispers could have used a bit more of a \"big battle\" at the end, and especially a bit more d\u00e9nouement. All in all, it's a thrilling story and a solid addition to Mr. Koontz's library of stories. Not the best one...but far from the worst, and one I enjoy revisiting over and over.As to the audiobook:It's hard to rate audiobooks on their presentation; either they're good or they're not; there's something you like or something you don't. The presentation was great, the narrator had a good voice well suited to a range of pitches that sounded realistic and easy to distinguish. The only thing that irked me (quite a bit, actually, since the word comes up several times throughout the narrative) is his pronunciation of the word \"clothes\" - fully pronouncing the th in a way that NOBODY does, which makes it sound both pretentious and unrealistic. I also choked in surprise when he pronounced every syllable in \"vegetable\": VE-get-a-ble...like it was some old TV comedy from the '40s or '50s. But other than that, it was an enjoyable presentation to listen to.Edit: Having listened to several dozen more audiobooks between the last time I'd listened to this one, and now, I have to say that the narrator's performance is quite excellent and one of the best I've listened to (the fastidious pronunciations above notwithstanding) ... where several audiobook narrators read in a dry, unemotional tone, this narrator ACTS. And it's pretty awesome!"}, {"userName": "Carl Alves", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1435359-carl-alves", "userReview": "Whispers is a tight, psychological thriller where a Hollywood writer and director is attacked by a man in her house. She fends off the first attack with a gun and his second attack with a knife, killing him in the process. But Bruno Frye doesn\u2019t want to stay dead. First, it starts with phone calls where the caller hangs up without speaking, and then it leads to another attack. Hillary, who much like Bruno, has her own childhood issues, starts a relationship with the detective on the case, and they have to delve into the mystery of Bruno Frye.There was good and bad in this novel. The good: The writing is tight, and there is a good bit of tension in the novel. The story moves at a fast pace and is pretty compelling. I thought the characterization of Hillary and the two detectives in the story was pretty well done. The bad: the character of Bruno Frye is a bit of a mess, and this is where the good characterization ends. This has always been Dean Koontz\u2019s Achilles Heel, creating realistic, believable, life-like villains. In pretty much all of his novels, the villains fall short of the mark. The other bad part is that when the mystery of Bruno is unveiled, it\u2019s an utterly convoluted train-wreck. That part of the novel lacks any level of realism and hurt the novel. On balance, there was more good than bad. If I could give it three and a half stars, I would, but otherwise this rates three stars.Carl Alves \u2013 author of Conjesero"}, {"userName": "R.a.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2456272-r-a", "userReview": "3.3 starsDespite a solid plot and weighted characters, Dean Koontz\u2019s suspense novel, Whispers, published in 1980, perhaps has not aged as well as the author intended.Unfortunately for Koontz and his first \u201cbest-selling novel,\u201d since its publication, a plethora of television crime shows with similar plots and characters have run on the various networks, ultimately rendering his main characters as typical and his plot as just a hair different from many an hour-long episode.Consequently, many elements in Koontz\u2019s novel have become less sharply defined.Yet, Whispers succeeds in both story and genre expectation.With this novel, Koontz effectively communicates the struggle for financial, personal, psychological, and emotional safety from a competitive and cruel United States \u201cworld.\u201d This world most definitely includes the past as well as the present.Almost all of the main characters are haunted: Hilary Thomas, Frank Howard, Bruno Frye, and Joshua Rhinehart. Tony Clemenza becomes the only main character without a dark or sad past.Although Whispers has a few suspenseful scenes, (and one that is scary), the novel unfolds more like a mystery\u2014the reader turning the page to learn the dark secret of Bruno Frye.Also, to add suspense to an otherwise formulaic-like plot, the author teases the reader with the possibility that other-worldly forces are at work\u2014suggestions that the novel may be a vampire narrative, after all.Yet, as the narrative progresses, Koontz, as he does with Phantoms, returns the reader to logical and plausible explanations for the seemingly fantastic events.And, there are some wonderful reversals here that provoke the reader to reflect: \u201cWho really is the victim? Who really is responsible for this cruelty?\u201dThe echo quality of the section headings and the mirroring epigraphs wonderfully reflect the unfolding plot as well as the reveal at the end.And, the Frank Howard-\u201cCrocodillos\u201d scenes wonderfully foreshadow and foil the Frye secret.Unfortunately, those television crime shows take away most from Koontz\u2019s main characters. Perhaps unique and fleshed out in 1980, the adept, well-meaning detective, (Tony), the guarded, successful screenwriter, (Hilary), and the melancholy, discerning attorney, (Joshua), now become much \u201cflatter\u201d characters\u2014almost types. Indeed, after a certain point, the reader may wonder if s/he cares about them.Koontz\u2019s direct style and sometime awkward dialogue detract at times as well. Even his wonderful detailed, picturesque descriptions of place become thwarted by a repeated organization so that they begin to feel like lists.Finally though, Koontz\u2019s focus on California, (the land and its projected ideal, as well as the attendant Hollywood and winery sub-cultures), family history, and abuse reveal an illusory American Dream where below the surface, violent cruelty abounds\u2014a substrata where a \u201cdemon penis\u201d is not only possible but probable.And so, Dean Koontz\u2019s Whispers, through its \u201ccruel world\u201d focus and its plot reversals, (and the Robert Louis Stevenson variation is one of its best), still can hold a reader\u2014this despite its now staid character \u201ctypes,\u201d sometimes staid style, and sometimes awkward dialogue.Yes, Whispers is worth the read, perhaps best for the summer season."}, {"userName": "Pablos", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28906405-pablos", "userReview": "Kiedy\u015b wygra\u0142em w konkursie powie\u015b\u0107 Deana Koontza \u201cPrzy blasku ksi\u0119\u017cyca\u201d.

This psychological thriller twists and turns in terrifying and creepy ways. It's part mystery, part horror story, and part love story. The starlet at the center of things triggered the murderous intent of the villain simply by resembling his mother. Due to no small measure of luck, she manages to fight him off twice, giving him a fatal injury the second time. And that's where the story would have ended in a less inspired book. Not this one, though, because the dead man comes for her again and again. I love how the story shifts to the different perspectives, giving just enough to understand the various characters, even the villain, without prematurely solving the mystery. The love story is also pretty sweet, but edgy, too, as the girl and the detective (who happens to be the only one to believe her) work to discover how a dead man manages to keep turning up. As for the horror side of things, the villain himself is completely insane, and his inner ramblings are shocking, and horrifyingly believable. To me it seemed that his descent into madness and murder could plausibly happen, and that totally creeped me out. As for his back story, it was tragic, and even his victim felt sorry for him by the end of things. And the whispers themselves, eep! The story walks along a tightrope between realistic and supernatural, with just enough of each to keep the reader guessing until the very end. I did notice a few choppy spots as well as some occasional heavy-handed foreshadowing and reminding of the villain's craziness. So, the story wasn't entirely smooth. Also, I didn't expect the detailed intimate scenes, which weren't the focus of the story, but which were given a rather generous play by play over multiple pages. Well described, but I didn't exactly buy what the lady seemed to enjoy(seemed like what a man might think a lady would enjoy). And the ending, while built up to rather masterfully, just kind of ended. Right after the action. Just ended. Not completely dissatisfying, but not the best ending I've ever read either.Overall, I really liked this story and would recommend it to folks who enjoy a good psychological thriller with a hint of mystery and paranormal connotations. That being said, the story focuses on a serial rapist/murderer. If that's not something you want to read about (in detail, no less), then this is not for you.I found a copy of this book in a little free library at work and picked it up because a relative said the author's books were good. At the time I thought he'd recommended this one, but I think I was remembering the wrong title. Anyway, loved it. I'm afraid I've forgotten all the character's names since it's been a few weeks since I finished reading this, but the story itself is still fresh in my mind."}], "description": "For thirty-five years, Bruno Frye has lived in the shadow of the mother who made his heart beat with constant fear.
