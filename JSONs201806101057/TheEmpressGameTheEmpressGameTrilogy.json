That's a real shame, because I was frankly bored out of my skull by most of it.Best Space Opera? Please.We got ourselves a bit of knife fighting in a tournament and then a road trip with blackmailing spies and a con job to put an empress on the throne of a multi planet empire. If that isn't bad enough, we've got the old trope of princess-in-disguise right out of standard fantasy fiction. (Or even Shakespeare, if you want to go there.) We've got the way overdone psi schtick and a throwaway nanoplague, too. What the book really needed were solid characters to pull a tired and not-so-fresh landscape into a vibrant and interesting novel.And we did. Very, very late. It saved the book in full estimation, but if we'd had the glories of that character vibrancy and depth and the hint of a great plot twist or two brewing at the beginning, I wouldn't have had any problem slogging through the meh roadtrip or the throwaway battles. I would have seen them as build-up and atmosphere enhancing, not just a page-filler that did oh-so-little to propel the actual STORY.So what am I saying? Oh, perhaps a bit of editing would have been in order. Do a time twist in the story. Bring some later events to the front end then let it back up and build again. Show us the love, the important action, the heartache and the epic, and do it right off the bat. Maybe then I wouldn't have been yawning and asking myself why I was reading this.It didn't end with a whimper, at least. But it sure started with one. Yes, Yes, the first scene was a fight, and yes she kissed the boy who would be hers in front of a whole stadium, and yes she was kidnapped and blackmailed almost right away... but that's no excuse for not grabbing me by the heart and insuring my interest from the very start. It didn't happen until much, much later, and that's my problem.And then there was the growing suspicion that the book was entirely about the teenage boy. So much revolved around him, and little about it was even interesting. The MC was a superstar, for heaven's sake, and I was wondering why the hell I was stuck in a boring cul-du-sac with this mute boy who's oddly a mary-sue. Huh? Huh? Why?Oh, it's only meant to give the MC something we can relate to? Some human charm and heartstring-pulling? No. It was too little and too drawn out and threatened to consume ALL of the momentum of the tale.I was also a bit annoyed with all the orphaned place-and-name-dropping that meant very little to me as a reader. Not even a two-word descriptor to placehold them for me or give the rest of the world a bit of depth and color. Though, to be honest, I'd be just as annoyed if I was just given some map that I'd never refer to as I read the book. I've seen WAY too many wonderful examples of incorporating names with beauty and verve, and it was all sadly missing from this novel. Zoom zoom idc zoom zoom.I know this sounds a bit like I should be giving the novel a one or a two star rating, but in the end, it did affect me. It was redeemed, even if it was very flawed. There were a lot of standard tropes and ideas that really required a first class talent to bring to life even though they're rather standard, OR it required such glorious characters and development that everything else receded into the background. We eventually got the latter, but it only half-worked as a great piece of writing and only late did it succeed in its characters.Not sure if I'd really recommend this to anyone, unless:You've never read about nano plagues happening off-screen and mostly out of mind unless you need a plot bogeyman.Or:You don't need anything more than a skimpy and almost inexplicable reason for holding a tournament designed for females to fight single combat for the right to become the Empress.Or:You've never gotten tired of the omnipresent hidden-princess trope.If you fall into any of these categories, then dive right in, friends. :) Fair warning, though, it'll take a while before the action becomes good and decent and not just a fart in the wind."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay", "userReview": "A preview of the next Disney animation where they get all their movie princesses together and make them fight with kris knives in gladiatorial combat. (My money is on Mu Lan).Ok, it's not that. That would be cool. This is also cool, and does feature princesses fighting in gladiatorial combat, but we also get politics, psionic powers, spy agency intrigue and a romantic subplot.Kayla is a princess from one of the Wyrd worlds. Populated by psychics and where the women are much stronger and larger physically then the men (seriously, she's described as being nearly 2 metres tall, putting her at about 6'4\" or 6'5\"). Since she fled from a bloody coup on her home planet with her much younger brother she's been making a living as a pit fighter. The book starts with her being \"recruited\" by the agency that caused the coup on her home planet in a scheme to cheat in the Empress Game so that the new Empress will be sympathetic to withdrawing the occupation of her home planet.The Empress Game is a bizarre addition to a fairly bizarre system of government where the Empress, one of seven people on a ruling council, is selected by physical combat between women of rank. Best not to analyze that too much, the point is princesses with large knives and swords.Of course, there's a hell of a lot more to this, and the book fairly drowns in plot. I think it's all a bit much for Kayla to take in because she inexplicably falls in love with her handler from the spy organization that killed her family. The romantic elements are fine when they're there, it just doesn't make a lot of sense how she got there in the first place.Overall though, it was very much a fun page-turner and I do recommend it."}, {"userName": "Maria V.

As this is obviously a cracked way to determine a political ruler, cheating is rampant. Isonde, a political mover and shaker who is also the beloved of the emperor, enlists help to find a body double who can fight. Her man Malkor finds Shadow Panthe, whose true name is Kayla Reunimon. She is, of course, secretly the princess of a conquered world.Despite being in the title, I found the games the most tedious part of THE EMPRESS GAME. They gave Rhonda Mason the chance to add more action scenes, but even with explanation I was never quite sold on the tournament as a way of declaring a ruler. The political machinations, however, were ace. THE EMPRESS GAME is a good choice for space opera fans who like a plot that moves quickly and don't mind a prominent romance subplot.Sparks fly between Malkor and Kayla, even though they are unsure whether they can trust each other. Even more than herself, Kayla worries about her younger brother Corinth, who has been mute since the assassination of their family. Keeping him safe and avenging her family are her top priorities, followed by returning to her people. She's only invested in Isonde's scheme as a means to get where she wants to go. Malkor, on the other hand, is only invested in helping Kayla out in order to put Isonde on the throne and further his political agenda. However, the two of them might have more ideology in common than they first suspect.I thought THE EMPRESS GAME could use a bit more emphasis on the space part of space opera, but that the complex layers to the characters' motivations were done very well. Mason has set up an intriguing system where almost all of the political opinions have some merit. I'm intrigued to find out what will happen in the second book of the trilogy."}, {"userName": "Jen Brooks", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18517811-jen-brooks", "userReview": "This space opera has it all: It\u2019s gut-wrenching. It\u2019s thoughtful. It has strong science fiction elements, and it\u2019s full of seriously kick-ass fighting scenes.Kayla Reinumon is an exiled Wyrd princess forced to hide her identity and fight in the Blood Pit to keep herself and her young brother alive. IDC agent Malkor Rua finds her there and, ignorant of her true identity, convinces her to play the starring role in the biggest con in the empire\u2014the fixing of the Empress Game, a martial contest whose winner will become the next Empress of the Empire. With her fighting skills, Kayla will impersonate Isonde, Malkor\u2019s choice to be the next Empress, a woman whose political ideals align mostly with Kayla\u2019s own. If Kayla wins, Isonde will gain an essential voice in the running of the Empire, while Kayla will earn enough money to take herself and her brother home.In addition to the enormous odds of simply winning the Game, Kayla and Malkor fight enemies on several fronts. A dangerous nanovirus threatens the Empire. A corrupt faction in the IDC attempts an assassination. Most importantly a dangerous scientist works to unleash a powerful new weapon that could mean the destruction of Kayla\u2019s people. Rhonda Mason does a masterful job of weaving all of these plot elements into one powerful climax, and the conclusion of the book is both satisfying in itself, while leaving plenty to be explored in books two and three of this trilogy.Kayla must fight battles both inside and outside the arena to protect her brother, her people, and herself. All while crippled with an inability to use her innate psi powers. All while hiding her true identity from Malkor and the rest of the Empire. In addition to the science fiction elements, romantic interludes, and detailed fights, it is Kayla\u2019s painful journey to recover what she\u2019s lost that will have readers remembering her long after the final page is turned."}, {"userName": "Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11625787-jordan", "userReview": "Always a pleasant surprise when a book exceeds your expectations. I feared this one would be a cheap Hunger Games knock-off, but that couldn\u2019t have been farther from the truth. It\u2019s way more interesting and the world is far more fleshed out than that comparison would imply\u2026.Kayla Reunimon is not someone you want to mess with. Her family is dead, killed in a coup orchestrated by treacherous agents of the Sekian Empire in an attempt to bend the advanced technological expertise of the Wyrds to their own ends. Now exiled and presumed dead, Kayla is forced to fight for her life in the gladiatorial pits as the mysterious Shadow Panthe. It\u2019s not much of a life, but it keeps Kayla and her little brother under the radar of the Imperial Diplomatic Corps\u2026until a new Empress Game is called, summoning princesses from across the Empire to the capital to compete for the hand of the Emperor Apparent in brutal combat. Now Kayla finds herself recruited in a daring scheme to fix the games\u2026and perhaps save her people in the process.At first glance, the central premise of the book seems completely idiotic. A galactic empire that decides matters of succession via gladiatorial combat? Far-fetched is putting it kindly. Except that the author knows this is ridiculous, and so do her characters. Thus, the whole point of fixing the game to put the right person on the throne. There\u2019s even a believable rationale for how that started, though it doesn\u2019t do much to redeem the practice. I was a bit skeptical going into the book, but I have to say that the author won me over. I shall certainly be looking for the next book in the trilogy, especially since this one simply cannot stand on its own.CONTENT: Minor profanity, along with some stronger fictional swearing. Occasional sexual innuendo, including a sex scene that is frank without being graphic. Strong violence."}, {"userName": "Al", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8613162-al", "userReview": "One review/recommendation of this book said if you like Jack Campbell then you might like this.

I downloaded it,put off starting it for a few days then finally started reading. I could not put it down until I finished the book.This book is not hard SF. It is,however,a finely crafted book with a plausible world view and characters that have a good deal of depth. The characters seemed to capture me into their world and feelings. Very much like Jack Campbell in how the characters develop and learn to relate to each other. I could easily picture then as they moved through the plot. Plot twists that take a while to develop and do not leave you hanging. PSI powers that may be hidden, a betrayal and a growing realization of the depth of partnership without psi.

I didn't feel the love. The feelings between Corinth, her little brother, and the protag was much much more visceral. That was an intense relationship.\u00a0I am looking forward to the next installment!"}, {"userName": "Rinn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2140832-rinn", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book for free from the publisher, in exchange for an honest review. Also posted on my blog, Rinn Reads.Lately, I\u2019ve had this really bad habit of receiving fantastic looking books, making plans to read them as soon as possible, and then ignoring said plans. And almost every single time, when I finally get round to the books, I wonder why it took me so long. The Empress Game was another fine example of this.The focus of the story is the Empress Game itself, but it was so much more than that. The titular event sees all eligible young ladies \u2013 ladies of nobility \u2013 fight in arena matches in order to win the position of Empress Apparent. These are not matches to the death, but they can be brutal all the same, and it was interesting to see a society (or societies, rather) where the nobility, particular female nobility, were trained in such combat. It is an interesting way of choosing the right person for such a position, and whilst the reason why is never fully explained, one can imagine the kind of person it would produce: ruthless and ready to make the tough decisions that come with ruling.Kayla is selected to take part in the Empress Game, not as herself but fighting as Princess Isonde, a fair claimant to the position with moralistic ideals, but sadly lacking the combat skills to prove herself worthy. Wearing a hologram, and with the help of some biometric/technological alterations, Kayla is able to take part in the Game. As the story progresses, the reader learns more about Kayla herself, her reasons for hiding, the history of her people and the future that may come to pass. What originally seemed like a book about fighting for the position of Empress soon turned into a book about fighting for what was right.As for Kayla herself, I really liked her. At first she is very suspicious of those who employ her services, and she sees Princess Isonde as a total snob. Her fierceness covers up a hidden past, and her protectiveness of her younger brother Corinth is admirable. Soon, she begins to warm up, and even starts making friends. Isonde herself is shown to be a good person, not just someone who wants a powerful position for the sake of it. And Malkor, the agent that finds Kayla in the first place, provides support and friendship for Kayla.A good chunk of the book is Kayla working through arena matches (within the Empress Game there are thousands). Mason manages to keep up the interest throughout, even whilst Kayla is just fighting as a day-to-day activity. The action and fight scenes were wonderfully written, with each movement feeling so fluid and easily to visualise.There were a few little issues with the book: the conclusion was over too quickly in my opinion, although it did have its tense moments, and the romance was rather predictable. I do also worry that the title/parts of the blurb will make people think the story is something like The Hunger Games, with a fight to the death, last one alive pronounced the victor. However, let me assure you that The Empress Game is nothing like that at all. It turned out to be a fantastic read and I\u2019m so excited to find out what happens in the second book. Whilst it feels like a classic space opera, it is also not too \u2018heavy\u2019, making it a great read for all types of science fiction fans. Whether you\u2019ve just started reading the genre or you\u2019re a hardcore fan, The Empress Game comes highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Charity", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45127085-charity", "userReview": "[ And as for Vayne, I really, really wish that Kayla and his relationship can go back to what it use to be.

So I must say I was kind of disappointed when no major happiness was expressed at that part. Hopefully we will be able to read more about them in the next book. And I really, really wish that Kayla can have her powers back soon. Hopefully in the next book. Overall, I think this book was written really well. The plot line was interesting and catching.

The setup is hokey, plot is derivative, and characters are cardboard. But I did read it all because Mason\u2019s storytelling is wonderful. Her prose is compelling and just when you\u2019re starting to wonder why you\u2019re still reading this, she throws a curve.Probably the only worse way to choose a ruler than heredity is combat. Oh, and all the contestants for The Empress Game must be royalty of some sort. So, the whole situation is doubly stupid. Oh, and the agency tasked to assure the integrity of the Games is subverting them, and that\u2019s \u2026 good?I am among the small minority not impressed by \u201ckick ass\u201d heroines. Call me old-fashioned. Combat is a waste of men; it\u2019s doubly wasteful of women. Unless, of course, your society thinks so little of humanity that women and men are equally expendable. Or worse, their injury or death a source of entertainment. That said, Kayla is a likeable, loyal protagonist.The opening chapters are a waste. If you read this book skip the first two or three. You won\u2019t miss anything you won\u2019t be told several more times and you can get right into the story.The ending, on the other hand, successfully concluded this tale while drawing the reader into the next.Quibble: This is not space opera, not matter what Mason\u2019s friends said in their reviews. I\u2019ve read hundreds of science fiction and fantasy novels. I love SF/F and space operas. Don\u2019t be misled as I was.Cover Art: any one holding daggers like that in a real fight will be dead in single-digit seconds. Presumably the critical design element was not the knives, but the bikini.Mason is talented. She should apply her talent to better stories.(After several days of reflection, I dropped the rating to two stars.)"}, {"userName": "Mieneke", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2485666-mieneke", "userReview": "The centre of the cover and the absolute star of the book is Kayla Reunimon a.k.a. Shadow Panthe. I adored Kayla. She is a fantastic character, both as Kayla and in her persona of Shadow Panthe. Much of what defines Kayla and by extension Shadow, is her family past and her fierce protectiveness of her little brother, Corinth. Kayla fled her home world with Corinth after seeing most of her family killed by a traitorous scientist from her home system of Wyrd space. I loved the setup of the Ordochian Empire and their magic system. The most powerful Wyrd are born with telepathic powers and they are always born as fraternal twins in a girl/boy combination. The bond between the siblings is strong and to have it broken is intensely traumatic. This is why Kayla fixes onto her younger brother, taking the places of his twin and feeling all of the pressure to keep him alive and safe.Once Kayla is recruited to be a body double for a princess in the Empress Game, she is forced to broaden her focus and allow more people in. It\u2019s no longer just Corinth with whom she has a connection, but she has to learn to allow herself to care for other people too, most notably Malkor, Isonde and Malkor\u2019s team. I loved the slow dance of her relationship with Malkor. For each step they take to close the distance between them, they both back away two more and they really have to work on communicating and allowing themselves to care. This is aided by the almost Arthurian triangle between Malkor, Ardin and Isonde, which though less tragic, is nonetheless clearly evoked is only through the resemblance of Ardin and Isonde\u2019s names to Arthurian characters.The characters in The Empress Game are wonderful, but the action included in the story is equally compelling. Mason includes several different layers of conflict in the narrative. The most visible one is getting Isonde on the throne and married to Ardin, which plays out both on the tournament fields and within the palace halls, but there are also the conflict between Wyrd and Sakien Empire and of course, Kayla\u2019s quest to get revenge for her family. I found all of these gripping, but the tournament plot line was the most fun for me. I loved the ritualised combat aspect and the excitement of following the matches, scoping out the competition, and plotting their defeat either by combat or diplomacy.Yet the central reason for\u00a0the Empress Game \u2013 winning the council seat for the Empress Apparent \u2013 it did leave me with questions. What happened if the reigning monarch doesn\u2019t have a male child? Or if the Emperor Apparent is gay? The heteronormative nature of this tradition is at odds with the fact that same-sex couples are treated as equal and unremarkable. Trinan and Vid, two of Malkor\u2019s team members, are to all intents and purposes a couple, but it\u2019s never explicitly announced, it just is, which would indicate this isn\u2019t something shocking or uncommon. How then is this provided for in the rules for the Empress Game? It would have been interesting if Mason had addressed this in some of the exposition on Sakien Empire politics included in the narrative.I found the juxtaposition of the combat in the tournament and the combat in the Blood Pit quite interesting. Both feature women fighting and both are cutthroat, but one is portrayed as a place where the women are in control and the other portrays women who have no choice but to fight, whether through circumstance or because they are slaves. The tournament features princesses fighting to gain powers and a prince, while the Blood Pit is nothing more than women fighting each other for the (sexual) titilation and gratification of men. Yet even at the tournament there are people who just attend the tournament for the excitement of seeing women fight. There seems to be a comment in here on the commingling of violence, lust, and power, which leads to some very problematic outcomes both in the culture depicted in the book and in our own.Rhonda Mason\u2019s The Empress Game is a wonderfully engaging and entertaining debut. A fantastic space opera tale, featuring fabulous world building and captivating characters, Kayla\u2019s tale has great crossover appeal, being a fun read for both adult and older teen readers.This book was provided for review by the publisher."}, {"userName": "J.L.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5757531-j-l", "userReview": "Disclaimer: I attended Seton Hill University\u2019s Writing Popular Fiction graduate program with the author and consider her a friend. I purchased this book for full price, though I had the luck to snag it at a book signing a few days before the official release.I read space opera, but I mostly read space opera by one particular author (Catherine Asaro\u2019s Skolian Empire series), because I measure all else by that standard.Now I read space opera by two authors.Despite the use of \u201cgame\u201d in the title and the tournament mentioned on the back cover, this book is nothing like THE HUNGER GAMES, so that\u2019s not even a conversation worth having. What THE EMPRESS GAME is instead is a space opera that accomplishes something even missing from the Skolian Empire books: space empires that are real empires, rather than a blatant good versus evil match-up where you are obviously rooting for one side.It is this level of depth that really drew me into Mason\u2019s story. There are deliciously villainous characters aplenty (each who have their own layered motivations), but I appreciated the fact that I couldn\u2019t point to one political faction and say, \u201cThese people are right and should get their own way.\u201dEvery space opera should have a little bit of romance, and this book definitely checks that box. But again, it\u2019s a realistic romance that doesn\u2019t overwhelm the plot. While it\u2019s obvious from the beginning which two characters are the intended romantic pairing, the situation develops organically and without unnecessary fanfare. I also appreciate that it is a partnership first and foremost.The science fiction tech is not as detailed as I might otherwise like, but that probably has more to do with me as a reader who likes to geek out rather than any failing on the author\u2019s part. On the other hand, her fight scenes are as dramatic, detailed, and REALISTIC as I could have hoped. This includes everything from hand-to-hand combat, knife and sword fights, to urban stealth assaults.I highly recommend this debut novel to all space opera fans, and even all science fiction and contemporary thriller fans."}, {"userName": "Patrick Scattergood", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21222561-patrick-scattergood", "userReview": "Visitors to this blog will most definitely have realised by now that I love a good ol' bit of science fiction. Book, movie, television show, I'm not fussed which form of media it takes as long as it grips me.Well The Empress Game by Rhonda Mason is a book that falls in to that genre and comes with a fair bit of talk and hype around it. I must admit that I wasn't familiar with her work so I came in to this book with a fairly open mind.Apparently this is going to be the first novel in a trilogy and it wastes no time in setting the scene for how and where the action is going to take place and boy is there a lot of action here. That's both a great point of strength for the novel and also one of the weaker links in it's armour. The action sequences here are well written and really give a sense of grandeur to the book, as do the descriptions of the settings. You really can picture the world that Mason has created in your head and that goes a long way in gripping in enough to want to see what will leap off of the next page. There are some moments that really felt like they would have been at home in a book from the Ray Bradbury era of science fiction writing yet retains Mason's voice very well.Characters wise, there are some really ones here yet you also come away from the story thinking that nobody is safe. I love that sense of surprise that Mason has running through the tale itself as it really adds to the scenes of tension. I have to admit that there were a couple of characters that just seemed to be there as dressing yet they did what they were there to do and moved the plot along.With a clear sense of action and adventure as well as memorable characters and set pieces, this is a science fiction / fantasy hyrbid that should hook in fans of the genre.Story 7.5/10Characters 7.5/10Cover 7.5/10Recommended 7.5/10Overall 30/40"}, {"userName": "Lais Roque", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6867694-lais-roque", "userReview": "AMAZING!!!!!I'm in a space opera romance phase and to find female pov are pretty rare!Kayla is a badass,loyal,strong,thoughtful,smart,rational,real character.. who have to deal with overwhelming situations and she makes wise choices!Malkon is a great character with his own disputes and hard choices and his growth to understand where his loyalty should lay is amazing.The book is action packed, so many different situations... the bloody pit, the empress game,political alliances,rescues,betrayals and of course, romance. the romance is really well put because it only happens with them getting to know each other and its nothing from nowhere. And the fact that Kayla has to choose where her loyalties lie is amazing and real because romantic love not always prevail.I was constantly heart broked with the storyline because those kind of situations with torture and experiments touch me deeply because remind me of WWII.

Improbably, those combat skillz get her recruited to impersonate another Princess in the Hunger For Power Games of Royalty to determine the new Empress. This is space fantasty the way Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote it, not really caring about any of the \"science\" as long as there are spaceships to get people from planet to planet every now and then, some magic medicine so the combat doesn't do any real damage, and more modern language (and buzz-words). Naturally, Kayla falls in love with the bloke who kidnapped her. Plus, made up profanity suitable for frutting broadcast TV and heroines who need to be bad ass without being really vulgar. Cat fights and Imperial politics. First of a trilogy, with a side plot of intergalactic virus and unrevealed traitors in the government still to be resolved."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5179054-ron", "userReview": "I\u2019ll try to describe this novel without using the done-to-death term \u201ckick-ass.\u201d There\u2019s action, for sure, intrigue, adventure, and a dash of romance. (But not that swoony, hearts & flowers mushy stuff.) Characters (especially Kayla) are vivid and just off-center enough to be unique. Although it\u2019s space opera, most of the action takes place planetside, but there\u2019s so much going on you won\u2019t miss it. The most refreshing thing I found about this novel is the subtle world building. No info dumps, every little tidbit delivered just when you need it and just descriptive enough. No overwrought lectures. The politics and intrigue are not overdone and rooted in understandable themes that contemporary readers can relate to. Fans of Ann Aguirre\u2019s Sirantha Jax series and Lois McMaster Bujold\u2019s Vorkosigan saga will like this.

Both literally and figuratively. This book breaks cliches and does a great job all the while.Ever since the release of the Hunger Games, contests to win the throne, have become a mainstay. In here, it is done in such a way that it stands on its own. Princesses have long been pieces to be fought over by the usually male protagonist. Here\u2026the pieces play themselves. The female heirs have to battle for their right to rule, no preened and perfect ladies here and no post apocalypse either. Its unique setting and style sets this book apart from a lot of other books. The Space Opera aspect most of all, but it is actually rather downplayed as most of the action takes place on the home planet of the Empress Games. It still works though. Kayla is about as far from preened as you can get. She is the lost heiress to a planet that was conquered by the very empire she is fighting for. This may sound familiar but it actually is written in such a way that you find sympathizing with both sides of the coin. That is one of the main themes of the entire book: There really can be a good reason for anything and it is a very slippery slope. The trick is knowing where your line is.She is a strong fighter but that is not the only good thing about her. She is determined to survive and protect her frail younger brother. In a lot of other stuff the opposite scenario is the case and kudos to the author. But Kayla has to more than just fight. She has to travel the less direct, but no less lethal arena of politics. She has to balance on a knife\u2019s edge trying to be two people at once. It gets even more complicated near the end. Unfortunately, while this book breaks a lot of cliches, it also props up a few cliches that add to this book\u2019s detriment. First of all, the romance. Granted, the romance in this book is not unbearable and does not come to light until fairly late in the story, but it is in there and follows a certain path which is a large blow to this books rating. What made Bookworm pickup this book was the fact that it starred a tough-as-nails female protagonist which is something popular media desperately needs. This book is a step forward, also a step back by the fact that Kayla winds up in bed with the main male character. It is not just any male character, its the one that she started out hating for getting her into this mess. We have seen a lot of that before and it doesn\u2019t make that much sense. Why would someone fall in love with someone they considered an enemy? More importantly, it reflects a wider trend that is ultimately detrimental to the strong female protagonists: that she needs a man to get by, that all she needed was a little attention from the opposite sex to become the hero she needs to be. That\u2019s not a very progressive way of thinking. What keeps the book from being put down is that it is not central to the bulk of the book and it\u2019s fairly realistic. It would have been better if Kayla had fallen in love with another male (or female) character, not the \u2018bad boy\u2019 that she first meets. Not every story needs a romantic angle in it. Another thing not every story needs is its story following a familiar pattern. ***WARNING!!! Slight Spoilers Ahead***In the latter half of the story, Kayla gets betrayed. While the author does a good job in making it a surprise, it is something to be expected in a story like this. Also, the ending is somewhat familiar as well. Neither of these things are poorly written. As a matter of fact, there is no clear good or bad side which is great. ***Spoilers End***Final Verdict: The Empress Game is compelling debut novel with unique story and compelling female protagonist. The fact that it fell into some of the cliches of the genre and its somewhat predictable storyline kept from achieving a full five ranking.

I went into The Empress Game expecting a space opera. While this is being classified as one, and in some aspects it is, it didn't feel like one when I was reading it. It read more like an other world fantasy - one that wasn't all that original. However, I was immediately drawn into the story and I liked it even if it lacked some depth and originality. The Empress Game is a tournament where the winner gets to be - well, the Empress. I did not think this to be a very plausible way for an Emperor to choose his Empress. The reason given for these games is because it's tradition and no one wants to change the way this is, even though our current Emperor has tried. Ok whatever. I was willing to overlook this. Kayla our main character here, is recruited to impersonate Princess Isonde, who isn't a fighter, in the games through some sort of bio strip and holographic means. I'm still not sure how it worked. This is against the rules and they could all be put to death if anyone finds out. One thing I did like was the way the author described the different fighting styles and how our protagonist, who is described as tall and athletic, had to fight different opponents differently based on size and skill. This is loads better than the scenario where the tiny woman beats huge opponents in direct hand to hand combat. Unless the tiny woman has some special powers, it's completely implausible. So points to the author for making these fights seem more realistic.Things are going along pretty smoothly for a while, but Kayla has her own secrets and they complicate things. Those secrets involve who she really is and her history, and they are tied in some ways to what the Emperor and Princess Isonde are trying to accomplish by making Isonde Empress. I won't say anything else about this because of spoilers.I found the characters in this mostly likable, even if a few of them could have been more fleshed out. We get no real insight into Isonde as a person or the Emperor, Alton. I liked Kayla instantly and her young brother, Corinth, who she is so protective of. Malkor was also likable. I did feel like the romance could have been developed better. There were hints of feelings throughout most of the book, but then they suddenly end up coming across too strongly near the end. How did we get from developing feelings to love so quickly? The romance however, does not overpower the story. It is left in the background mostly until near the end, which was good. I will probably read the next book when it comes out in August. I'm hoping for more of a space opera feel in the next one.Review also posted at Writings of a Reader"}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4204126-lesley", "userReview": "The Empress Game is a space opera featuring an all-lady combat tournament, a group of outsiders who possess mental powers, and a massive political conspiracy (several, actually). If that doesn\u2019t make you want to read this book, just dive into the first chapter and within a few minutes, you\u2019ll be hooked.The Empress Game starts out with a punch, introducing us to our badass main character Kayla in the most awesome way possible. I absolutely love that opening fight scene. There are plenty more after that (a few of the fights are so detailed as to become a tad bit tedious), but that first one is the best. Kayla is a survivor, and she uses her wits as much as her fists. Even so, events in the book tear her up psychologically so that, by the end, she's kind of an emotional wreck. There are some truly heart-wrenching moments with Kayla's family that really made me feel her pain. But as the (cliffhanger-ish) ending proves, Kayla may be down, but she's not out of the fight yet. And the fight is far from over.The story takes us on a journey from pit fights on a backwater planet to the main political arena of a vast empire where Kayla is never sure who to trust. The political intrigue is another of the book's highlights. In fact, my favorite supporting character is the sharp, politically savvy Isonde. I love how the author builds the relationship between Kayla and Isonde; instead of making these two formidable women rivals, she makes them a team. I really hope Isonde returns in the next installment.Speaking of relationships, there's also a romantic subplot that starts off great. Unfortunately, Kayla's love interest pissed me off so much at one point that, even though he eventually wins back Kayla's trust, I could never fully get back on board that ship. There's still more to come for this couple though, as the ending leaves their relationship on rocky ground. I'll be curious to see how it evolves in the next installment.Overall, The Empress Game is an entertaining series opener with outstanding worldbuilding, interesting characters, and a lot of potential for future books. After a kick-ass beginning, the story slows down a bit and loses some of its suspense, but the ending ramps the tension back up as the characters enter the endgame and everything goes to pieces. The conclusion is excellent, but it leaves a lot of threads hanging. I\u2019m already looking forward to the sequel in this planned trilogy."}], "description": "\u2018Power, grace, deadliness defined.
