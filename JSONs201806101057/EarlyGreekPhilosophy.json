I couldn\u2019t imagine a better introductory book then this one on the subject. Below are a few quotes from Jonathan Barnes\u2019s excellent 40 page introduction along with my brief comments:\u201cFirst and most simply, the Presocratics invented the very idea of science and philosophy. They hit upon that special way of looking at the world which is the scientific and rational way. They saw the world as something ordered and intelligible, its history following an explicable course and its different parts arranged in a comprehensible system. The world was not a random collection of bits, its history was not an arbitrary jumble of events.\u201d ---------- This is central to their spirit of inquiry, an approach compatible with a modern physicist or chemist.\u201cNor was the world a series of events determined by the will or the caprice of the gods. The Presocratics were not atheists: they allowed the god into their brave new world, and some of them attempted to produce an improved and rationalized theology in place of the anthropomorphic divinities of the Olympian pantheon. But their theology had little to do with religion, and they removed most of the traditional functions of the gods. Their thunder was no longer the growling of a minatory Zeus.\u201d ----------- Again, the Presocratics have kindred spirits in the science departments at modern universities.Jonathan Barnes goes on to write how the Presocratics explained the world in ways that were systematic and economical, that is, these early philosophers wanted to \u201cexplain as much as possible in terms of as little as possible.\u201d Some of their key concepts were order (kosmos), nature (phusis), origins (arche) , and reason (logos). --------- These Greek words are supercharged with meaning. I use one English word for simplicity sake. How supercharged? The author does a fine job elaborating.The actual words of the Presocratics have come down to us as fragments. Here are several of my favorites:Xenophanes\u201cBut if cows and horses or lions had hands and drew with their hands or made the things men make, then horses would draw the forms of gods like horses, cows like cows, and each would make their bodies similar in shape to their own.\u201dHeraclitus\u201cThe uncomprehending, when they hear, are like the deaf. To them applies the saying: though present they are absent.\u201dDemocritus\u201cTo a wise man the whole earth is accessible; for the country of a great soul is the whole world.\u201d\u201cThe desire for more destroys what is present \u2013 like Aesop\u2019s dog.\u201d\u201cOne should tell the truth, not speak at length.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Erick", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31567333-erick", "userReview": "Quite a great introduction to the earliest strains of Greek philosophy. One has to keep in mind that these are fragments of larger works and that it is somewhat conjectural as to how some of these fragments fit together in the works from which they were culled and quoted by other (often later) writers. The source reliance on Laertius and Simplicius is rather pronounced as well. There are certainly common themes that run through the writers treated here. You have, of course, the early philosophers' thoughts on the nature of the cosmos and the primacy of the elements, i.e. earth, air (and/or ether), fire and water. Often one writer positing the primacy of one of these elements over the others. Obviously, \"elements\" here simply means basic cosmic constituents and does not denote the elements that make up the periodic table -except maybe in a more loose sense. Also common is the speculation on pre-creation states, often likened to a chaos and/or a void where all qualities and substances existed in a non-distinctive unintelligible conglomeration. Rather interesting is the debates on dichotomies that often show up here: infinitude/finitude, limitedness/unlimitedness, uniformity/multiformity, unity/multiplicity, changeableness/unchangeableness, intelligibleness/unintelligibleness etc. Dichotomies are posited and discussed for qualities as well: dryness/moistness, lightness/darkness, bitterness/sweetness, hardness/softness, coldness/hotness etc. There are also some more idiosyncratic notions that crop up with the Pythagoreans and the Atomists. Of course, the preeminence of mind (nous/logos) is often posited and discussed as well. I had already taken note of Heraclitus and Anaxagoras prior to reading this from previous research; and, once again, these writers' ideas I find rather fascinating. I would also add Empedocles to that list as well after reading this. I must say that I unapologetically read the first chapters of Genesis in a way that is reminiscent of Anaxagoras' thought. Reading the creation account in Genesis in the banal and trivializing literalist fashion that fundamentalists do has always seemed rather silly to me. This was a great work to get me in the mood to start rereading Plato again. I do recommend it as an introduction to Greek philosophy in general. One should also keep in mind the provisos I listed above though."}, {"userName": "Michael Nash", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7049262-michael-nash", "userReview": "I feel like I'm not really expert enough to rate this book. Obviously, one can't really downgrade the content (this book sucked because Heraclitus was WRONG when he said that the world was made of fire). I found that my reaction to it was the same as my reaction to most non-historical ancient texts; some of it was brilliant, some of it was a fascinating look at where our ideas came from, but most of it was deadly boring. The only thing you can really comment on then, is translation, selection of texts, and explanatory notes, none of which I know enough about to really criticize, so I am going to assume that Jonathan Barnes did an excellent job with all of it. I will say that I thought his italicized explanations were lucid and the translation flowed well."}, {"userName": "Jacob Aitken", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5958504-jacob-aitken", "userReview": "This book's shortcomings aren't really its fault. The presocratics weren't systematic thinkers, and even if they were none of their writings survive intact. The editor Jonathan Barnes does a fine job of putting them together, but even he admits that many of the arrangements are arbitrary.1.Emerging consensus on the infinite. The \"infinite\" implies \"boundary markers\" (216).2.If God is infinite, and infinity transcends boundaries, can he even be named and spoken? Did Greek Philosophy lead us to this point?3.Another consensus (rightly) is that the gods were silly, but the place the gods held was not abandoned. The concept of \"number\" took its place; \"different angles were assigned to different gods\" (Philolaus, quoted by Proclus, 219). This became the realm of \"forms\" with Plato. With Anchoretic Christianity the place of the forms were transformed to the realm of saints and angels (per Tillich). 3.1St Paul said we are no longer under the elemental spirits of the age (Galatians 3-4). 4.For better or worse \"ousia/physis/essence\" usually connoted materiality. It was the stuff of the universe and the universe was usually considered eternal. The editor doesn't draw this out but this explains some of the problems in the early church on Christology. They weren't simply sinful heretics by refusing to say that the Son was the same ousia of the Father. They understand ousia to be material, which the Father was not.5.Is the axiom \"like is produced by like\" (Democritus) correlative to the chain of being: as above, so below?6.What's the difference between this and neopaganism?7.Democritus says it's stupid to want children (280) and sex is irrational. Compare that with the Old Testament. Maybe there is a difference between Hebrew and Greek thought."}, {"userName": "Martti", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22446927-martti", "userReview": "What exactly is cosmos, the universe of all things, everything, the whole world? Did the universe have a beginning? If so, how did it begin? Why does it move and develop? What are its basic constituents? What is rain, wind, thunder, minerals, plants, animals, and human life?These profound questions are the subjects of this excellent book. The questions were first asked and answered by early Greek philosophers. The timeline of the book starts at 585 BC when the first Greek philosopher, Thales of Miletus, predicted an eclipse of the sun, and ends around 400 BC when the period of Plato and Aristotle and the famous Greek philosophical schools began. The author Jonathan Barnes, Professor of Ancient Philosophy in Oxford University and in the University of Geneva, is undeniably an expert in the Greek philosophy. In 300 pages, Barnes presents ideas of famous pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales, Parmenides, Heraclitus, Leucippus, and Democritus.It is strange that none of the earliest philosophers were Athenians. Philosophy bloomed first in the eastern shores of the Agean. It was at Miletus in current Turkey where the Greek philosophy was born. Miletus was a busy commercial trading place with connections to Greek, Black Sea, Egypt, Italy, Persia, and Babylonia. Barnes does not claim that the Presocratics began someting entirely novel but he concludes that Thales and his associates were men of genius. They were the forerunners of Aristotle and through him the forerunners of modern science and philosophy. The Presocratics invented the very idea of science and philosophy. They were champions of reason and rationality. They offered reasons for their opinions and they gave arguments for their views. They allowed gods but they removed some of the functions from the gods. Thunder was explaind scientifically - it was no longer a noise from Zeus. Iris, the goddes of rainbow, was nothing but a multicoloured cloud. Of all the works of the Presocratics, no original writings have survived for us to read. Still e.g. Democritus was a prolific writer and apparently wrote some 50 books. Some of the works endured at least a thousand years: the scholar Simplicius in the sixth century AD could still consult some original Presocratic texts. What we have are some reports, references and quotations made by later scholars. The book contains English translations of all the surviving philosophical fragments of the Presocratic thinkers. I found the structure of the book excellent. For readers not deeply familiar with early philosophical issues the 27 pages of the introduction are illuminative. The introduction is followed by a 14-page synopsis which briefly summarizes the key ideas of each philosopher. The remaining pages devote one chapter for each of the 20 philosophers of the book.To me the main motivation to read the book was to become more familiar with the thinking of Leucippus and Democritus. These two philosophers, the Atomists, presented the theory of atoms which still, after 2500 years, is surprisingly valid in the science of our days. They argued that the universe consists of indivisible atoms which are small and solid. They have size and shape and hardness, but they lack secondary qualities (colour, smell, taste, etc). The atoms exist for ever and are unchangeable. Atomic movements create the world: colliding atoms can stick together, hooks in an atom lock with the eyes of another atom. When atoms collide or are entangled, the aggregates appear as water or fire or plants or men. Everything happens by a mechanical chance; but given infinite space and infinite time, it is only to be expected that the complex structures of the world will somewhere and somewhen be formed. It is truly amazing how Leucippus and Democritus could have such profound ideas 2500 years ago, almost without any instruments and without previous works, just by observing the nature and thinking! To me this can well be compared with the achievements of other giants of the science like Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein. It is a great loss that no original writings of Leucippus and Democritus have survived. Luckily we have quotations from their writings saved by later scholars, e.g. the following famous maxims:- By convention hot, by convention cold: in reality atoms and void.- In reality we know nothing - for truth is in the depths.- The world is change: life is opinion.- I would rather discover a single causal explanation than become king of the Persians.I quickly found that 20 pages/day was a suitable amount when trying to assimilate the text. Thank you for writing this excellent book, Jonathan Barnes!"}, {"userName": "Richard Newton", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton", "userReview": "Here is the situation - there were a whole lot of pre-socratic philosophers and we only have fragments of their writings. In some cases, we don't have any of the originals, only people commenting on the originals or even people commenting on others' comments on the originals - and many of those commentaries are a couple of thousand years old. The texts were in ancient Greek, and using a style and references that will be difficult to understand even with the best translator. The result is subject matter that is open to huge variations in interpretation and is never going to provide an easy read. This is not a book for the feint hearted, but given the contents I don't see how it can ever be a straightforward read without simplifying the material to the point at which it ceases to reflect the original thinkers' intentions. There are some gems here, but there is also a lot which is simply impenetrable.Barnes makes a very valiant attempt to present the material. There are other books if you want interpretations and commentary (including one by Barnes) - this book never sets out to provide that. It is primarily a reference source and as such, it is actually pretty good. What difficulties there are, are largely a result of the original materials."}, {"userName": "Aaron", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1538729-aaron", "userReview": "I read this book in a class on Early Greek Philosophy, and this book was hard to digest at the time. This book is an excellent reference for philosophy students and maybe classics scholars, but not so much for the general public. This book is focused on the Pre-Socratics (philosophers before Socrates) and therefore does not contain anything by Socrates, Plato or Aristotle. However, I think they added in some Greek philosophers that came after Socrates but were outside his teaching and influence. Barnes has done his work compiling and editing (and translating?) these texts. He takes care to show his work, noting every questionable, contested, missing, or reconstructed piece of the text. Commendable for scholarly work; tedious for the general public. There's always a trade off in deciding what to preserve and what to gloss over, and Barnes takes preservation to the extreme. Decent book for introductory course on philosophy, probably very good for graduate students, bad starter for the general public.

They covered a vast number of subjects under the term philosophy, gave birth to formal education and politics and often times they were prosecuted to death because the public deemed them impious. Sadly, that aspect of their lives too remains true today. This is a great collection of primary experts found in books by other philosophers (as majority of their works are destroyed). Fortunately or unfortunately, thats about it. Barnes doesn't provide much context to the excerpts but the huge collection of every major school of thought (Milesian, Eleatic, Atomists etc) makes it worth reading. Barnes has another book titled \"pre-socratic philosophers\" that focuses on the philosophy particularly, instead of the philosopher as it is in this book. The chapters on the atomists and milesians were by far my favourites. I was disappointed to see many names left out, especially the sophists. That said, you can't depend on this book alone and you would need to compliment it with some other text to give you a better picture of the early days of philosophy in greeks."}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2458054-frank", "userReview": "This book records nothing less than the first known attempts at a naturalistic accounts of the universe. In some of the later philosophers reviewed here, especially Democritus, we also encounter a broadening of interests along the lines associated with Aristotle. Two impressions from J Barnes book:1) Very little original material is available. Mostly we are dealing with commentary and summaries written 500-1000 years later. There is plenty of reason to suspect the representativity and accuracy of many commentaries. Where original texts do exist, they are fragmentary, possibly corrupted and out of keeping with modern standards for lucid description. The worst case is Empedocles. For all his wisdom, he was a conceited windbag and confused the issues by writing in verse. So when he refers to the anthropomorphised forces of nature, we can't know to what extent he was using metaphor.2) The intellectual universe of these philosophers is very difficult to inhabit. Often, seemingly familiar concepts turn out to be false friends, and care is needed to have a chance at grasping their sense.Against this background, much is cryptic, but, also, occasionally exhilarating. We are witnessing the birth of the western mind."}, {"userName": "Rajas Pargaonkar", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52473198-rajas-pargaonkar", "userReview": "Simply indispensable. In this book, lay all the extant fragments of the Pre-Socratics (not literally every copy since there were sometimes multiple manuscripts with roughly the same quotes). Jonathan Barnes' commentary at the beginning of this book is absolutely incredible. He takes us through the history of the Pre-Socratics, their historical milieu, issues in textual criticism, and then guides us intermittently throughout the rest of the book. The content itself runs the gamut from thoughtful, to nonsensical (Zeno's proof of the impossibility of motion), the fascinating, the beautiful, and the downright incomprehensible. It's a shame we don't have more of these works, but given the revolution to come in Plato and Aristotle, we should be more grateful we didn't lose the works of those two irreplaceable thinkers.A mandatory reference as well as a peek into an era where science and philosophy were still straining to express themselves.

Aside from a brief intro and synopsis, Barnes largely lets the philosophers speak for themselves, as best they can. This is both good and bad.
