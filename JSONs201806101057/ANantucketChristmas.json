A Nantucket Christmas is the story of a boy, Maddox, meeting a dog. But before he does, Thayer tells us the individual stories of the boy and his family, and of the dog and his plight. This book meandered and wandered, describing Nantucket in its Christmas glory, and describing the personalities and quirks of Maddox's family members. Unfortunately, the direction of the plot (boy meeting dog) wasn't clear midway through. I was left wondering, What ABOUT this boy and his family? What is this book about? Where is the conflict? Sure, there were small conflicts, but I saw no focal point, no literary conflict around which a compelling story could be told. So, A Nantucket Christmas was mostly a slice of life story with an exciting birth scene and a warm meeting between boy and dog. I wanted to love it, but with its uneven writing, sprinkling of puns, and reflective paragraph about yawning, I struggled to finish. This book might work as a short story or a Lifetime movie, but it doesn't have the forward moving energy required of a good novel. I received this ARC from NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Angela Holland", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2340220-angela-holland", "userReview": "I loved this book so much that it is hard to put it into words. It is a heartwarming story that pulls you in from page one and does not let you go even after you are done. This is the fist Christmas book I have read this year and the first by Nancy and I have to say it puts you in a good mood and makes me want to find more books by her. The only part of the book that I did not like was the story line with Snix/Pooh, but I totally understand why it had to be told in the way it was, it just really pulled at my heart strings but I will not say anything else about it as I don't want to give anything away. Nicole and little Maddox were my two favorite characters in the entire book. Nicole was such a nice person you can't help but like her and little Maddox was just the cutest thing. Kennedy on the other had was a character I could not stand but the story would not have been right without her. I encourage you to pick this book up and read it this holiday season."}, {"userName": "Maureen Timerman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3840941-maureen-timerman", "userReview": "I enjoyed this quick evening read. I read a lot and was able to figure out how the story might end, but there were definitely some surprises.Unfortunately, there is a side story to this, and it begins with the prologue. The taking of a cute puppy, loving, feeding, cuddling it. Then when it is a few months old, and a gangly teenager, abandon it. So begins this story, a poor soul who waits on the side of the road for his family to return to him. Breaks my heart at the cruelty.Nicole has married a man with a grown daughter, Kennedy, she has a precocious three year old, Maddox, who will wrap you up with warmth. Now even though, Kennedy's Mom left her Dad, and has been in a relationship with another man, and her Dad has now remarried. She secretly hopes to bring her parents back together. She has gone so far as to try and sabotage the beautiful Christmas, that Nicole has prepared. Sebastian is blissfully happy in his new marriage to Nicole, but Kennedy can't see beyond her own wants.

And A Nantucket Christmas by Nancy Thayer is a different and charming Christmas story which is down to earth, and so thoroughly enjoyable. It is the story of building relationship, the delicate intricacies and dynamics of a broken family. It is also the story of an abandoned dog and a boy, and how they bring about a change in the family. It is moving story about love and loss and the Christmas miracle.The story opens with Sebastian and Nicole, both finding love a second time. Nicole Somerset is taken by her husband Sebastian, a former attorney, to his house in the island for Christmas. And in time, Sebastian discovered that Nicole was the opposite of Katya, his first wife, who was a perfectionist and who kept him on a tight leash and a rigid routine. Nicole, on the other hand, introduced Sebastian to the delights his first wife disdained, walking rather than biking, homemade pie \u2013 eaten while watching television, stopping to watch birds and wildflowers or watching the sunset. Sebastian on his part takes her swimming, sailing and tennis. It was an unforgettable time for both of them, with Christmas fast approaching.But all good things must come to an end. Bringing the curtains down on the joy and happiness of the couple was none else but Sebastian\u2019s daughter, Kennedy. Heavily pregnant, she turned up unannounced with her family, including her husband and three-year-old son Maddox. Though Nicole was warm and courteous to her step-daughter, Kennedy was ready for a fight and avoided her as if she does not live in the house. Spoiled to the core, Kennedy was also keen on her father-mother getting back together though it has been over four years since their divorce. Her son on the other hand was a lovely toddler with an impeccable behavior for his age, and was excited about the coming Christmas.Nancy Thayer added a beautiful mix to the story by including the story of Snix, a dog abandoned on the island by people when they left at the end of summer. Snix wandered around the island trying to find food and shelter. Nancy does a magnificent work in capturing what a dog might be thinking. What makes A Nantucket Christmas more delightful is the tender, warm and heartfelt bonding between Maddox and Snix. And in the end, it is Maddox and Snix who succeeded to turn things around for good in the family."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28559520-terri", "userReview": "I guess the thing to do around Christmastime is to write a book that you can hype for the Christmas season.This is a long winded bore. And a little bit weird.Kennedy and James have a three year old son going on thirty who thinks things like, \"This was awesome, too. Maddox rarely got alone time with his daddy, who was always working.\" What three year old thinks about things like \"alone time?\" What three year old says things like, \"No, thank you. I want to make a fort out of the picnic table and benches.\" What three year old would be hauling tables and benches around in the snow to make a fort? What parent would let a three year old run out into the night time snow without a coat when the three year old says, \"I'll be right back, I left something outside today while I was playing.\"?Kennedy is a drip who can't stop talking about feeling like a beached whale because she's having a baby. And of course, she hates her dad's new wife.Nicole, just married to Sebastian can't quit thinking about how insecure she is with her husband's daughter, Kennedy. She is widowed without children and works as a nurse.Sebastian can't quit thinking there's some way to make Kennedy think Nicole is just amazing. And it never occurs to him to stick up for his new wife when his daughter, Kennedy, mistreats her. Instead he just hangs around hoping.And James is just a background nebbish.Add to all those annoying characters is an annoying sappily pathetic stray dog, Snix, who has his own sporadic chapters all to himself. He is of course abandoned and cold and it's Christmas.The story line and the characters are too overly sentimental, boringly long and vapid and no amount of quaint seaside Nantucket at Christmastime makes it better."}, {"userName": "Audra", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5483242-audra", "userReview": "I received this book in a Goodreads giveaway.While reading the summary of the book, I mistakenly assumed Nicole's step-daughter, Kennedy, was a spoiled child or teenager. But, no, she turned out to be a grown woman who was married, had a young child and another on the way. I have very little patience for children like that and absolutely none for adults like that. Even in fiction. Kennedy annoyed me the entire book.The book was plagued with stilted, awkward writing. I no longer have the book because I donated it to my office's library, and I think I'm not supposed to quote the unofficial copy without comparing it to the finished product, but there's a particular line that stands out in my memory. When Kennedy, her husband, and son are on the ferry on their way to Nicole's house, the dad says to the little boy something like, \"Look, we're almost there. Soon we'll be warm and Nicole will serve us a delicious meal.\" Who talks like that?! Especially to a young child! That is just one example but that type of writing can be found throughout the book.Although I can't point out specifics because I no longer possess the book, the author made the boy's thought process way too sophisticated and not at all believable.Overall, a major disappointment."}, {"userName": "Melina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9277323-melina", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. It is a fast heartwarming story. It is a story about a family, that is sadly like so many families today. The story starts out from the perspective of a dog, Snix, that has been abandoned on Nantucket by his owner. It progresses through the different perspectives of Sebastian, Nicole, Kennedy, and Kennedy's son Maddox. The family is spending the week leading up to Christmas at Sebastian and Nicole's Nantucket home, and there is lots of tension as Kennedy wants her mom, Katya, and her dad back together and she doesn't want to accept Nicole at all. But after a major scene, Kennedy has no choice but to accept Nicole. The writing is so good that the book just flows, it is one of those books that once you start, you can't put down, it is so enthralling. I loved how the story had a happy ending, especially for Snix, aka Pooh.

Now very pregnant Kennedy, her husband, and young son, Maddox, are all expected to spend Christmas week with her father and his new wife who Kennedy wants to replace with her mother even though her mother left her dad for a younger man.This was definitely the pinnacle of Christmas mess ups as Kennedy tried every way she knew to undermine Nicole and get her dad to rethink her parents' divorce. Throw in a 6 year old boy, a stray puppy who adopts him, a divorced wife who shows up after a spout with her new man, and it can only spell complete disaster. But a Christmas surprise, a lost boy and puppy, and a stable can all change everyone's perspective.

Retired nurse Nicole and her new husband, Sebastian are two people who met later in life and fell in love. Their Christmas plans include a visit from Sebastian's adult daughter, Kennedy, her husband, and their three-year old son Maddox. To call Kennedy and adult, though, is using the term loosely. Kennedy is spoiled, rich, self-centered, and, to top it all off, 8 months pregnant. You can probably guess that combination is not one that bodes well for a festive, fun Christmas, especially since Kennedy views her step-mother as an interloper. Thus the stage is set for this \"slice of life\" story about the forging of new family bonds. The biggest problem with \"slice of life\" stories is that they can be both lacking in conflict and somewhat formulaic. Especially in one that has only 145 pages. In the case of this story, though, there was plenty of conflict to go around between Kennedy and her step-mother and Sebastian and his ex-wife too name a few. And while the story was a bit formulaic, I felt the writing was good enough to overcome that aspect. Besides, most of the reason we read these stories is because we know where they are going and we like where that is, right? In addition, this book was filled with interesting characters. First and foremost, there was Kennedy. Some may say that no adult woman, especially one with a child, could be so self involved. To me that was the fun of her character. I could safely dislike her, roll my eyes at her when she was at her worst, and yet, I could also sympathize with her a bit. Nicole was also a great character and I loved the way that the author used her to highlight both the stress inherent in the season, and the stress inherent in the situation. I also liked Maddox and particularly enjoyed his three-year-old antics. Perhaps my favorite, though, was Snix/Pooh, the dog. While by no means a major character, I enjoyed reading about his life and seeing things through his eyes.  Since so many of the Christmas stories out there center around romances (which I enjoy), I found the focus on the family in this book to be a welcome change. In addition, at just 145 pages it was a quick read and I would recommend it for those of us who like the holiday story genre."}, {"userName": "Margaret Madden", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21224317-margaret-madden", "userReview": "3.5 stars The winter season on Nantucket is very different to the busy summer time. The summer crowds have returned to the mainland, the sun has tucked itself away and the storms are brewing. The rental houses empty out and the year-round residents get ready for their Christmas visit from Santa and MrsClaus, who each year, arrive by ferry with great excitement from the islanders. This year is going to be different for Nicole. Recently married to Sebastian, she is about to host her first Christmas on Nantucket with Sebastian's pregnant daughter, Kennedy, and her family, who are coming to stay for a week. A new family,including a less than welcoming step daughter, may not make for the merriest Christmas.The book starts with the change of season on Nantucket and Nancy Thayer describes the closing up of the summer houses, the abandoning of 'extras' and the onset of winter. Nantucket is always portrayed as a playground for the wealthy and the usual beach scenes with bobbing yachts in the background are par for the course. This short novel is a different approach and is a refreshing look at the island, still from the angle of the wealthy residents, but a change all the same.Kennedy is one of the most annoying, selfish, self-centered adult I have come across in fiction. A wife and mother, without a worry in the world, she spends her time being vicious, nasty and hurtful to her father's new wife. She thinks she can persuade him to get back with her mother (who is also a nasty piece of work) and never considers that her father may actually be happy. Sebastian sees his daughter through rose tinted glasses and rarely protects Nicole from his daughter's vile attitude. All through this, Nicole cooks up a storm for her guests, bends over backwards to facilitate them and gets no praise. The story is sweet, the island sounding wonderful, as usual, and the Christmas feeling takes over at times. Kennedy's darkness is pushed to the side, luckily, by the amazing food that Nicole rustles up. Warning: You will crave food while reading this book!A light, if unrealistic, short book. Perfect for a pre-Christmas atmospheric read and will make you grateful for the family you have. Another look at how money cannot buy you class, or nice manners."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5375148-beth", "userReview": "This is a sweet story of a nontraditional family dynamic working out their issues and celebrating a Nantucket Christmas.

My favorite was Stepping. I looked forward to getting this book and don't mind reading a Christmas tale in April. I was very disappointed, however.Nicole and Sebastian are newly married and this is a second marriage for Sebastian, who has a grown daughter and grandson. Nicole eagerly looks forward to having James. pregnant Kennedy, and 3 year old Maddox join them for a special Nantucket Christmas. What we find as the story moves forward is a bratty, sniveling, conniving woman who is still wanting her parents to get back together despite the fact that dad is remarried and mom has a long time boyfriend. As a character. I found Kennedy to be unbearable and hard to believe that a grown woman would act like this. Three year old Maddox has a thinking process like an adult rather than a three year old. (Maybe he and his mom should trade places??). It was very annoying to me that the dog was a deep thinker. Seriously? I love dogs and they do understand a lot but please don't attribute them with a human like thinking process.This anticipated book was a huge \"miss\" for me. It seemed as though perhaps the publisher pressed Nancy into writing a Christmas tale which so many popular authors have done with success - Andrews, Macomber, etc. It does not have the characteristic description of emotions that Thayer books are known for (with the exception of Nicole getting fed up with Kennedy's antics and wanting to leave when her husband's ex shows up acting like she owns the place.)

But, Kennedy's obsession with her parents getting back together may ruin the Christmas spirit.This was the typical Christmas story. It was a feel-good story against the backdrop of quaint Nantucket. Christmas really is better in historical New England. I liked Sebastian and Nicole's relationship but Kennedy was just too over the top for me. She was probably 30-ish and acted like her parents divorce was ruining her life. She was immature and petulant. However, it was cute, I read the whole thing in just a couple of hours, and it was nice to get a read under my belt.
