This is absolutely not a bad thing. I love apocalyptic stuff, but Kenyon takes the apocalypse to a new level of horror. The nuclear blasts are just the beginning. For a group of friends in their late teens, luck could not have been kinder to them, for they had decided to get high in a bomb shelter when all hell breaks loose. Then, things start to get very strange and unexpected. This is a fast novel and your excuse would have to be great indeed if you let this book out of your sight without finishing it. It was something new, something daring and successful, and, quite simply, one of the best horror novels I've ever read and one of the most enjoyable books of any genre I've read. Kenyon is still offering it for free so you have no excuse to not read it.\"The best things in life are free,\" and all that."}, {"userName": "Bandit", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit", "userReview": "This was an amazing book. Post apocalyptic fiction at its finest and horror at its most terrifying. There was just an intense unstoppable dread throughout the whole story as it sped toward its inevitable resolution. Terrific character development, great pacing. Couldn't put this book down and as a result now I'm out of Kenyon books to read.

I wouldn't lessen this book by using only the short hand version! I received my free book what else!?! \"Sparrow Rock\", earlier this evening and just got finished with it. It was phenomenal to say the least. Except for stopping for supper(which I ate at my computer) and a bathroom break, I couldn't stop reading it. I absolutely LOVED it! The plot line only stopped long enough for you to catch your breath before it hit you with another surprise. I kept my hand over my open mouth the majority of the time!!! The sub plot was also heart wrenching that it had me crying at the end. Without giving anything away, if you read only one book once in a blue moon, Check the color of the moon and read it!!!!! I am still on a high from it! I plan to buy a copy ASAP and add it to my book collection! This is a re-read waiting to happen and I'm sure I'll love it just as much the second and third time around.

To me, the central theme is Peter\u2019s personal growth, in the backdrop of the massive destruction of mankind by a Nazi-type group seeking human cleansing in order to rebuild the \u201csuperior race\u201d. This involves using nanotechnology to create smart insects that takes over bodies. I was expecting one horrifying event after another in this postapocalyptic horror. As a pleasant surprise, I find that it is mainly a story about Peter\u2019s past and his development as he moves through this holocaust. The story is told through the eyes of Peter, as he journeys from a boy shattered by his father\u2019s abuse to a man responsible for the remaining group\u2019s survival. Peter\u2019s voice is affecting and lyrical as he moves from impressions of the present and connects with past reflections. Each character in the story have their role to play. Jay and Sue have some connection and information to the plot for mankind\u2019s cleansing. Jimmie is the weak and nervous character. Dan is the born leader whose veneer of strength became cracked, thereby transferring the mantle of leadership to Peter. And Tess is the ever-present calming force that we find is Peter\u2019s alter ego. While the characters could be more original and complicated, they are portrayed realistically and sympathetically. These believable characters can live right next door. I would have liked for the character of Tess to have more of a presence to justify the plot twist at the end in which we find out that Tess is really from Peter\u2019s imagination. My reaction was more of a \u201cSo?\u201dThe idea of using nanotechnology to create smart destructive insects is interesting. However, I\u2019m left hanging with my question of how these things were controlled. I want to have more vivid technical details. This creates an inability for me to connect securely with the idea of destructive nanotechnology. I\u2019m also not convinced of the power of a Nazi group to create such massive destruction, or their ability to invest in a technology that created that much damage. The explanation is not vivid or clear enough to make me believe it. What I\u2019m left with is more of a Night of the Living Dead meets The Swarm.Despite those weaknesses, Nate Kenyon\u2019s strong gift for moving prose makes this an engaging and poignant story. I thoroughly enjoyed the story in terms of Peter\u2019s quick initiation into manhood as he confronts his past. This writer has a gift for touching the reader that is beyond the horror genre.**********************************************Past Notes As I'm Reading:I decided to keep my notes on here before I write my review. Those yellow stickies were getting out of hand.1. Realistic contemporary voice in a believable tone of someone in the middle of Armageddon keeping a journal. I can believe that it is happening today with the high schoolers in this book.2. The challenge for the writer is that he's covering a topic that's been covered many, many times in books, movies, etc. It's a timeless topic, the end of the world. Since civilization began, people have been worried about the end of the world, but here we are. I'm curious to see how he would develop a voice unique from the others.3. I like that it is realistically philosophical in nature, of what an insightful young person would think if he were to face the end of the world. I just passed a part where he was talking about humor, which is in sync with my idea of humor, its importance and the fine line it dances over.\"There's a razor-thin line between hilarious and offensive when you're talking about death...\"\"...Humor is a way of facing the pain without the fear or breaking it down in ways we can handle...\"So far, this book is believable as to what could possibly happen if young adults were to be caught in a shelter at the end of the world. Its pitch is just right. It's not overly dramatic, as could happen when depicting a tragedy.************CONTAINS SPOILERS MOVING FORWARD***********4. On p. 93 Ewww. Squished rats. And the rats were biologically dead when they attacked the kids. What is going on? Now I see that this is not the typical Nagasaki atomic bombing, where the skin melts off the body. What could have caused a corpse to be animated? I'm wondering whether the explanation would be believable to a science layman. I like how Nate went through the visceral details of the attack of the rats, the squished rats, and the kids' reactions. I feel he spent a lot of time imagining and walking through the scenario in order to get as much visceral detail as he did. He might even have stomped on some rotten apples to get the sound of a squished rat's head. That is horror well done. The magic of horror is the visceral effect, the fear and the disgust, and perhaps the guilt that you're enjoying such fear and disgust. Another magic of horror is the set up for a horrific surprise. Nate is now setting us up for something. The fun begins.5. On p. 194. Now I find out more of what\u2019s going on. Nanotechnology is involved. The only thing I know of nanotechnology is that it involves being able to control matter on an atomic and molecular scale. That could apply to genetics. So, according to this book, nanotechnology modifies the structure of insects so that they act as organized destroyers, perhaps being controlled by somebody or something. My layman mind says that is plausible, since nanotechnology is not fully known, although currently such control is not possible. The horrible thing about these insects is that they can enter a body and control it. That is why those dead rats can go on the offensive. I can believe that.I enjoy Peter\u2019s philosophical ruminations throughout the book because I\u2019m that kind of a person. Nate has Peter made some beautiful descriptive thoughts. At some point, though, the ruminations can get too long. I want the ruminations to be interrupted more often with a change of scene, or some sort of a distraction. My thought goes to Richard Matheson\u2019s I Am Legend, where he is reflecting on the horror of being the only normal human left, but the pace is constantly interrupted by focus, other characters, etc. I realize it\u2019s difficult to have lots of action when the only setting is inside of a bomb shelter. Frightening things were happening. It\u2019s not the events that I want changed. I feel that the pacing of the writing needs to be changed somehow to lessen the monotony of ruminations.The characters were depicted realistically and sensitively. I feel that I know them, that they can live right next door. Nate has built each character for a purpose, with Peter having some sort of a connection to all of them. Because of his background, he was able to be the person they each go to as a confidant. Each character has a function necessary in an apocalyptic story, from a hysterical selfish guy to a born leader. Jay, the genius geek of the group, becomes the person that gives the reader insight to what is happening to them. The part where Jay makes the big revelation becomes too cliche for me. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve seen too many movies where one knowledgeable character blurts out the big secret that explains a lot of things. I prefer that the big secret is revealed in a less obvious way, although it\u2019s kind of hard when you\u2019re trying to tell people that nanotechnology is involved in this. At least in Dune, the complicated economic plan for Arrakis was explained in the form of a mirage of Kynes\u2019 father lecturing him as he lays dying in the dessert.We\u2019re being set up for something to come up. There\u2019s something about Sue\u2019s grandfather being involved in all of this. And there\u2019s talk of them leaving the hole since they found what looks like a hidden military base in Alaska. Will they leave the hole? Is there going to be another big revelation and surprise? I\u2019m wondering why the U.S. is involved in this. If it hadn\u2019t been for them not being able to pick up any radio signal with the exception of the military frequency, I would have thought that their small town was part of an experiment, and that the rest of the world is actually okay. But nope, it looks like the rest of the world is in trouble. But why would the U.S. government destroy its own people?"}, {"userName": "Jeannie Sloan", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2134638-jeannie-sloan", "userReview": "First off let me say that I really wanted to love this book because I got it free from the author like a lot of other people.That said I have to say that I only thought it OK.I have a hard time caring for characters who I don't really like very much and I didn't like the main character much.Yes,at times,I did feel compassion for him because of what he went through with his family before the big event but that doesn't mean that I thought he was a very worthwhile individual.And the big 'Oh.So that's what's going on' I saw coming way before it happened and also I thought that it was no big deal.There was also nothing new in this book.If you have read any end of the world stuff you have seen all of this novel before.It also seemed like he used gratuitous violence too much.Things are much more horrifying without all the blood and guts used in this book.That was disappointing.I think that if you are a young reader just getting into horror for the first time then you might like this book more than I did.Especially if you like the kind of horror movies that show a lot of grue and violence.I don't obviously so I don't think that I can recommend this book to any of my adult friends.I thought that the author's previously released works were much better.I still don't know why he was giving it away for free.Maybe he couldn't find a publisher but I kind of doubt it because there does seem to be a market for this kind of book.I do feel kind of bad because I didn't like it better but there you have it.I can't change the way I feel."}, {"userName": "Ken McKinley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5919799-ken-mckinley", "userReview": "Pete and his high school friends are looking for a place to party.

As Pete looks out of the hatch to see what the commotion is, mushroom clouds fill the horizon and the nightmare begins. Sparrow Rock is an emotionally-charged entertaining read. It's strength is its realistic and flawed characters that are developed and revealed throughout the story. As the danger ratchets up, Kenyon does a nice job taking us along for the ride. You feel like you're in the bomb shelter with the group trying to figure out what to do next.

The ending wasn't my favorite and it's the only thing that keeps the story from being a full five stars.

For some reason, if you mess up typing, it cannot be edited (choose 'select all' and delete to start over). Put the word 'convert' in the subject line. You'll get a return email with a link to your free conversion. It will not be labeled anything that you might recognize so pay attention to the file name. You'll have to specify where it goes as well. My Kindle has three file folders to choose from; audible, documents, and music. My free conversion landed outside these folders so that it didn't show up in my Kindle. I had to manually move it to 'documents' for it to be recognized on my Kindle.Having now read Nate's story and returned to review it, I find that the bit about how to get it converted for your Kindle might be helpful.

Maybe after reading John Ajvide Lindqvist's Let the Right One In, and Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, I have come to expect much more from the horror genre than another horror pulp. I do find them addictive like Brian Greene and could see the appeal of being told what to feel and think in books like his and Nate's. Right now, it seems that he relies on the side twist plot of the narrator's mental illness and hallucinations, and the fear of the return of the loved one from the dead for horror material. While his work is very easily written and does show hard writin' makes for easy readin', it would have been better if he had put the art in rewriting. Especially when he fails to omit subjective thoughts and opinions in the narrative part of the story. As a reader, I feel uneasy when a writer tries to sell the emotion rather than just write the atomosphere of the setting as a mood which he does very well. The idea of him at every page practically waving a sign saying, 'You understand what going on, right?' or 'Are you gettin' what's going on in this story?' spoils what could have been fine descriptions and actions of the characters themselves. Also he seems to copy the writing style of a medicore novelist, relying on italics to show inner thoughts and signifying beginning and ending of the story. I wish he would just tell the damn story. I feel with more confidence and practice, Mr. Nate Kenyon would make a fine story teller and I look forward to checking out his future works if he would be willing to push himself into raising the bar of writing.

Sparrow Rock is the story of a group of teens suddenly facing first a nuclear blast and then a terrible second wave while living in a bomb shelter. Suddenly faced with a post apocalyptic world literal minutes or hours after settling into one of the girls' grandfathers' shelter the group goes through a great deal of stress and anxiety as they attempt to understand what's going on. Unaware of the second wave these teens struggle with the concept of never seeing their families or the civilization they knew before and the cabin fever of living in a bomb shelter soon takes its hold. When the second wave hits it hits with a startling bang and soon what was outside and thus out of their view becomes a terrible reality. Pete our narrator has already endured many trials in his young life and in many ways these experiences are what keeps him stable while the others are panicking and unable to cope. Their reality is now a series of surreal and incomprehensible nightmares that over and over again take away something they'd come to depend on in their nightmarish world.Sparrow Rock is an enjoyable read and well worth your time!"}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "Pete, Jimmie, Dan.

The plot sounded too familiar and used to me. But, as a rule, I read every book to its end, and Sparrow Rock is one of those books that reward the effort and get better with every turned page. Step by step, the story reveals more depth and complexity and proves that it is far more than your average 'day after' monster-horror scenario. As we get more familiar and sympathetic with the narrator, his background, his thoughts and feelings, we slowly come to understand why he often acts so peculiar and funny.

So it was with the same gusto as an Aberdonian at a wedding scramble that I picked up Sparrow Rock the fourth leisure release by Nate Kenyon. He was giving away free PDF's of this book to stir up interest in it, by asking those who took a copy to publish a review. Hopefully for him this has paid off and brought in may new readers, certainly the buzz doing the rounds on the message boards I frequent is very positive and the review from my favourite and most trusted blog Dead in The South was very favourable indeed.Sparrow rock tells the tale of a small group of teenage friends, who one night decide to go and get drunk and smoke pot, in the bomb shelter built by the Grandfather of one of them. Why do teenagers in these novels always have way more fun than I ever did. While they are having a good time in the shelter, the world as we know ends in a fiery nuclear holocost.The survivors holed up in the bomb shelter, soon realise they have to face more than just surviving a nuclear winter, there are things out there, things that want inside.Nate piles on the tension from the get go, and keeps on piling it on and on, building up a real sense of claustrophobia and hopelessness against a seemingly unstoppable foe. As the story unfolds we discover that their night of fun in the shelter was not just a lucky chance, they were meant to be there, revealing a global conspiracy that has built since the second world war.If you are looking for a point of reference, then the sense of claustrophobia that oozes from this novel is comparable to John Carpenters The Thing. Yes the book is that good, Kenyon has developed tremendously as a writer since his first two novels. The sense of dread, fear and isolation is so strong that it stays with you a long time after reading it, you almost become as isolated as the protagonists in the novel. With these end of the world novels it is always hard to come up with a good believable and satisfying ending, not so here I thought the ending was perfectI have previously only read two of Nate's earlier books, Bloodstone and The Reach, his first two releases. These were decent, if not excellent reads typical of most of Leisure's releases lately. I have had his third, The Bone Factory in my TBR pile since Christmas, and have always meant to get round to it.

Sparrow Rock is one of top releases in horror for 2010. It has crawled its way into my top 5 books for the year and is, so far, the crowning achievement of author Nate Kenyon. While Kenyon's past work was always technically well written, I always thought his weakness was the story, which for me, is the most important. I was thrilled to discover that the story of Sparrow Rock succeeded on almost every level. With tremendous conviction, originality, and chock full of scares, author Kenyon throws the reader right into a literal apocalypse, where six youth are trapped in a bomb shelter after barely escaping the effects of a nuclear holocaust. Claustrophobia, paranoia, and some hideous discoveries inform the small group something more sinister is at work than just the bombs going off. Kenyon packs each short chapter with enough violence, gore, scares, and cool concepts to thrill even the most jaded horror aficionado. For some, the story might contain a couple too many coincidences, but everything eventually makes sense, even if you have to suspend a little disbelief at times. While the characters might not make the same decisions as the reader would if in their shoes, I was pleased that their actions were at least consistent throughout the story. You could also argue that the story, at times, could have been longer and that some events happened too quickly, but I didn't have a problem with that. For me, the faster pace keeps you on your toes with an unsettling feeling. New readers interested in Kenyon's books should definitely pick this title up as their starting point, since it is without question his best work to date. I am very much looking forward to what he does next. This one will be tough to beat."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin", "userReview": "Post apocalyptic novels have come a long ways since the 50s and 60s. The writer can no longer get away with just one of two nuclear bombs. In the early 60s we were naive. The schools were still teaching \"duck and cover\" when On The Beach, Fail-Safe and Alas Babylon were published. Nowadays those novels seems as naive as \"duck and cover\". Little did we know that we really should be worrying about zombie epidemics, bio-chemical holocausts, and mind-controlling insects.Nat Kenyon's Sparrow Rock starts out like a typical after-the-bomb book. A group of teenagers are hanging out in a fall-out shelter when nuclear mayhem breaks out. They have no choice but to wait it out while pondering what actual damage has been done to the world. More than half of this nail biter of a horror-thriller occurs in the shelter yet the survivors slowly gets a glimpse of something that is much more terrible than just a nuclear attack. When you concentrate on a small group of individuals in a relatively small area, the author better focus on character development and Kenyon does just that. The character who narrates the story has a few problems of his own that are weaved expertly into the plot. Kenyon's teenagers talk, act and think like teenagers which causes us to care about them. Sparrow Rock rarely lets up on the suspense and there are images that are so disturbing you will probably be having nightmares. Yet the novel is also about more mundane horrors.

Without hesitation, Nate Kenyon manages to pull readers into the story from the first sentence, creating a sense of intrigue and mystery right from the start.As the story unfolds, Kenyon keeps throwing new little tidbits in the mix the become increasingly creepier, creating a brooding atmosphere of doom and inevitability that will give you chills.With characters that are tangible and dimensional, the readers is always directly involved on the front lines, feeling what is going on, how the friction and tension increases, as well as the characters' fears, and with every new revelation of another horror, the novel becomes a more and more engrossing read.\"Sparrow Rock\" is a true gem, one that I simply could not put down and one that fascinated me on every page. Kudos to Nate Kenyon for delivering one of the most memorable post-apocalyptic books in a long time."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/810550-bill", "userReview": "This was a very good and fast read. As you have seen from other reviews and the cover synopsis, this is about a group of teens looking for a place to party and end up in one of their grandfather's bomb shelter.As luck would have it, nuclear war wipes out North America and it seems these kids are the lone survivors. There are other dangers besides fallout, though, as we soon discover.Kenyon shows he's got it. There's tension and the storyline is strung along through chapters that end with forecasts of doom that make it impossible to put down.This guy is still a relatively new on the scene and his latest is darned entertaining. He's showed some promising King-like talents as far as getting into the heads of his characters, and for that reason I'll definitely read more of him."}, {"userName": "Dana *", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1405032-dana", "userReview": "This is an excellent story of the dystopian future from the point of view of a young survivor.The tale of survival and goal setting is fantastic. The characters are well drawn, especially the central character. This character has more than their share of flaws, and dramatic events to bring out a true nature.The mechanism of the apocalyptic events is very interesting. I liked the problems that it posed for survival.you will enjoy this story if you like stories about: zombies, dystopian future, survival, horror, apocalyptic scenarios."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/979054-pamela", "userReview": "Sparrow Rock is one part Stephen King\u2019s Stand By Me, one part Nevil Shute\u2019s On the Beach, and definitely a haunted house story for the Apocalypse.

Was not what I was expecting which was a nice surprise. I loved the suspense and gore. The twist at the end.......I did not see coming. I really liked Tessa too. All the bugs were a little over the top. Hence a 4 star rating versus a 5 star rating."}, {"userName": "\u2623Lynn\u2623", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7101656-lynn", "userReview": "Gory and fun!"}, {"userName": "Jake Maschino", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3719077-jake-maschino", "userReview": "Wow!
