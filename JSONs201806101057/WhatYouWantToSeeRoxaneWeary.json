Multilayered PI centered mystery. This series is led by a compelling heroine who has depth, heart, and a whole lot of snark! \nRoxane Weary is down on her luck. The buzz over her last case has died down, and she is once again struggling to make a living as a PI. Therefore, she is back to taking on small, easy cases like following a woman who appears to be cheating on her fiance. But this case has depth, and when the woman is murdered, Roxane digs for answers, and in doing so, finds herself in grave danger. I wouldn\u2019t say that you need to read The Last Place You Look in order to read What You Want to See, but doing so would add another layer.I had extremely high expectations for this book. Seriously, Roxane Weary was one character that kept popping up in my head long after I read The Last Place You Look. What You Want to See does not disappoint. Roxane is back, much in the same state as book one, except for maybe not quite as drunk or dependent on alcohol. She is much more conscious about the choices she makes but still struggles with making the right choice. Her demons are very much present, she is torn between her feelings for her former lovers Catherine and Tom. Her dead father is still very much in her head, and family drama is still brewing. What I love about this series is Roxane, which is due to Lepionka\u2019s writing style. Roxane\u2019s voice is extremely compelling, and I especially love her snarkiness. Lepionka writes Roxane\u2019s character intelligently. Her voice is strong and her moxie shines through. I hope I don\u2019t have to wait too long to read the next book in this series. I highly recommend this series!

It's been a hot minute since I was introduced to such a fabulously flawed main character, so Roxy and I bonded immediately and have been mates ever since\u00a0The Last Place You Look. I'd be lying if I said\u00a0What You Want To See\u00a0wasn't one of my most anticipated sequels of 2018, and I'll be darned if Lepionka didn't deliver another solid entry to the series. These books are an interesting take on the procedural, because you are able to feel as if you're solving the cases alongside of Roxane without the pacing issues that some crime fiction of this sort seem to face.Book #2 takes place shortly after the events of book #1 wrap up, and I love that the author didn't abandon the \"disposable\" characters from case #1. It seems so easy to dump anyone who's not a lead cast member after each installment has been wrapped, but I feel taking some of these characters (mainly Shelby and her dad) only increased my love of the personal side of Roxy's daily interactions. If I'm being honest, the plot sequencing and development in each of these cases are superb, but what has truly kept me coming back is the stellar character development the author has attained. Roxane, her family, and her lovers are all as real to me as this donut I'm eating in Shelby's honor.\u00a0Also, I love donuts and I eat them at any chance I get.\u00a0In case you're new to the series, you may be unaware that our main character is bisexual. This opens up new doors that many authors in the mystery/suspense/thriller genre have yet to explore, and while I was skeptical in the first book due to the overwhelming onslaught of a past and present lover being introduced all at once, I have to take my hat off to Kristen; she 100% new what she was doing and how this set up would work. In the previous novel, we get a lot more of Tom and more of a mysterious backstory on Cat. In the sequel, Cat is front and center and we see an entirely new side to this part of Roxane's private life. When I first saw Cat jumping back in I wanted to scream \"No girl PROTECT YOUR HEART!\" but again, I'll be darned if Lepionka didn't completely sway my opinion in 320 pages. I adored the characterization in Cat and where the book left things between the love triangle.The case pertaining to this individual book was intriguing and complex, and I have to say there was one twist in the end that I did not see coming. My only complaint here, and it isn\u2019t with the author because she has no control over this, but I wish the synopsis was a little more vague and brief. You pretty much know everything that happens in the entire book because of it, and I think there would have been a bit more suspense and build up if some of those details were left out and up to the reader to find out along the way. Overall, a highly enjoyable read and even better than the first one!*I received a review copy from the publisher via NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Kendall ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42327848-kendall", "userReview": "What You Want To See by Kristen Lepionka is another one of my favorite series!

When the check bounces and she stops tailing the woman, the fianc\u00e9e turns up dead later that day. From there, things get really strange in a good way. This is a fast paced book with lots of action.  I haven\u2019t read the first book in the series. To be honest, I should have paid attention to the other reviews that recommend you read it first. I liked Roxanne. She\u2019s tough, the kind of PI that doesn\u2019t back down when the police tell her to \u201cuninvolve\u201d herself. But there were some gaps in my understanding of her personal life from not having read book 1. There are a lot of characters here and every now and then I\u2019d have to pause to remind myself how they fit in. But overall, it\u2019s a fast, engaging read.

Who killed Marin Strasser? Was it the fiance, like everyone things? That's what Roxane wants to know...I loved the first Roxane Weary book, The Last Place You Look, so this one was a no brainer.What You Want to See is a murder mystery with a lot of other stuff muddying the waters. It sure as hell looks like the fiance did it. But what the hell is going on at that print shop? And what's with the former employee, Leila? And Marin's son, Nate?Roxane has her shit together a little more than in the last book but still makes a dog's breakfast of the case, running afoul of the cops and other bad elements. She's still conflicted over her feelings for Tom and her feeling for Catherine but not disastrously so like in the last book.Kristen Lepionka wove another great tale here. I thought I knew who killed Marin a couple different times but she pulled the rug out from under me, a great feature in a mystery. It would have been easy for Roxane to coast into this book relatively unscathed after the last book but she's clearly changed. I loved that she's become sort of a mother figure to Shelby and is trying to stay out of Tom's life while still having feelings for him. The way she handled Catherine in this book was a step in the right direction after the way she handled things in the last one.What You Want to See was a great sophomore effort from Kristen Lepionka. Her Ohio setting is almost a character unto itself and Roxane is well on her way to being one of my favorite sleuths.

But her case devolves quickly, between a bounced check and Tom (Roxane's dad's former partner) and a rude cop named Sanko showing up on Roxane's doorstep with the news that Marin is dead. Not only that, they make it pretty clear that they want Roxane to stay out of it. But this is \"pathologically nosy\" Roxane we are talking about. Stay out of it she cannot. So Roxane continues to work Arthur's case--as the husband, he's the main suspect after all. Roxane is determined he's innocent: a perspective not shared by Tom and Sanko. As she digs deeper into Marin's life, she discovers that she led quite the double life, and Roxane finds herself lost in a world of antiques dealing, wealthy families, and a lot of danger. I loved this book. I love the first person aspect. The Roxane Weary series is straight-up great mystery writing. No unreliable narrator, no chapters that alternate POV or time periods, no gimmicks--just an excellent protagonist and a strong plot. It makes you long for mysteries of old (think Kinsey Millhone). The ways I love Roxane cannot truly be enumerated--she's a female lead in a mystery series, for one. She's smart, witty, and sarcastic. She's bisexual, but this characteristic is just who she is, not her main defining element or the entire defining point of the novel. As a bisexual female, I cannot stress how amazing this is in literature. To have bisexual representation (and have that representation be intelligent, funny, and not portrayed as evil and deviant), well, it's wonderful. She has relationships of all kinds and works on figuring out herself, just like any other person. Gasp! Imagine that. I couldn't love Roxane more (or Kristen Lepionka for creating this character). Also, Roxane calls waffles \"golden beauty\" and well, what more do you need in your PI? She's the Leslie Knope of private investigators. I was worried that the second Roxane Weary novel wouldn't stand up to the first, but I was anxious for no reason. The second book is just as wonderful and intricately crafted as the first, and we get to see Roxane both struggling and growing professionally and personally. The case is a great one--it had me frantically reading and totally shocked me at the end, which I love. So rarely can a detective novel keep me guessing to the anymore. Marin Strasser is quite the character, and her web of lies pulls in a whole host of supporting characters. We also see Roxane navigating new territory with Tom, her former lover (and, as mentioned, her dad's ex-partner), and get appearances again from the appealing Weary brothers and Roxane's mom. Roxane is still working on her relationships--not just romantic ones, but life ones, and you'll be touched as she figures out trying to be a \"surrogate aunt\" to Shelby, who appeared in book one. Watching her let her guard down at times is enjoyable. The case is still mainly the star, though, and it won't disappoint. It's complicated and intriguing and everything comes together in ways that will make you gasp and keep you riveted. I was definitely shocked several times while reading. Not to mention I love it when an author can write a character that I truly hate--you know they've done a good job when you can feel that anger viscerally through the pages! Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this book. Maybe that it's over, and I have to wait now for a (hopeful!!) book three? I love Roxane. I feel kinship toward her for sure, this sarcastic, bisexual PI whose still navigating the world around her. The mystery in this book won't disappoint, nor will the characters. If you haven't read the first Roxane Weary novel, I do recommend reading it first (mostly because it's also so good - my review here ), but this will stand on its own. Highly recommend - 4.5+ stars.

When I read Lepionka's The Last Place You Look last summer and was first introduced to Roxane, I knew that I was going to love her, flaws and all...and she has many like most of us! What I didn't expect was that I would love What You Want To See even more than the first book since so many sophomore entries into any crime procedural can fall flat and lose their shiny appeal. Not this time! Oh no, I loved What You Want to See so much!!In book two, Lepionka has crafted an extremely well-written detective novel that has an outstanding plot, and the case Roxane solves is suspenseful, intriguing, dangerous, and will keep you guessing right up till the end! If you read the first book, then you know that Roxane has a tendency to investigate cases even after she's been told to stay out of the way and let the police do their job. In this book, it is\u00a0even after Tom, her former lover and her dad\u2019s ex-partner, tells her to stay off the case and out of the way!\u00a0But...she is Roxy and super inquisitive (nosey!) by nature, so she continues to dig into the case she was hired for by Arthur Ungless, especially after his fiancee, Marin turns up dead and he becomes the prime suspect for her murder!Actually, I\u2019m not going to say much more about the plot except that this book begins almost immediately after book one ends (and I highly recommend you read them in order, so you know exactly what is going on with several characters!), and that it is riveting! The main reason that I\u2019m not going to write much more about the plot is that the synopsis of the book is so detailed and pretty much tells what the book is about! And I really want you to read these books (both)!! You\u2019ll fall in love with Roxane as much as I am if you do...promise!And that really brings me to what I love most about this series and especially this book: in this second book, the characterization is just superb and if you know me from reading my other reviews, characters, their development, and their overall characterizations are my weakness in any novel. If I can\u2019t connect with the characters in an emotional way, then I\u2019m not going to enjoy the plot as much as I normally would no matter how marvelous it might be! Roxane is one of the most interesting female characters that I\u2019ve encountered in a long time because she is so raw, sarcastic, honest, complex, smart, vulnerable, so real, and I could just go on!In case you aren\u2019t familiar with the books, Roxane is bisexual, and I love how that brings much-needed diversity to this genre but doesn\u2019t define Roxane nor does the novel revolve around her sexuality. She is really a fantastic, strong female lead character that I wholeheartedly love!Besides the character of Roxane, Lepionka really developed the secondary characters as well, and I was glad to see this since you never know in a book series who will reappear! Roxane's relationship with teenage Shelby from book one was a relationship that I loved since it showed a completely different side of her as she stepped into the role of \u201caunt\u201d to the younger girl. There was more in book two of Roxane\u2019s relationship with Cat, and this completely knocked me off my feet since after book one, I was not Cat's biggest fan. It also had less of a romantic relationship with Tom, yet the love triangle remains and although love triangle tropes can be overdone and trite, it isn\u2019t in this case because Lepionka knows what she is doing...I'm amazed at what a fantastic writer she is! I anxiously look forward to where Roxane\u2019s love life heads in book three.Okay, so I'm done gushing about Roxane and\u00a0Lepionka's amazing plot, characterizations, oh the story has impeccable pacing too! I loved this book...I know I said that already, but I can't find anything but good things to say about Lepionka's newest novel! You'll love the clever, suspenseful mystery and the characters are fantastic.

Roxane Weary is a Private Investigator and she is everything you want in a strong female lead!I'll try to be a little more brief in my description of the book - the synopsis definitely gives away a lot more than it should for a thriller/crime fiction novel! Marin Strasser's fiancee thinks she is having an affair, so he hires PI Roxane Weary to find the evidence he needs. A couple days later, Marin is found dead in an apparent mugging gone bad. The police begin to focus their attention on the fiancee when things don't add up.As Roxy continues to look into Marin's past, she discovers all kinds of secrets that she's been keeping hidden away. Along the way, she uncovers conspiracies, scams, and other suspicious events. She quickly finds herself ensnared in this web and Roxy must decide what to do with the stakes rising.Roxy is everything you want in a female lead - she's flawed and troubled, but she works hard and does all that she can to get the job done. One thing I wasn't aware of from book one is that Roxy is actually bisexual. So a love triangle that continued over from LAST PLACE YOU LOOK was there and elaborated on by diving into the characters more. This is an element you don't typically see of a main character in the thriller genre, so this was a refreshing change of pace.Overall, if you're looking for a fast pace crime fiction read, then you'll definitely want to pick up the Roxane Weary series!

But how could I not miss Roxane with all her smarty assery and wisdom? Not to mention, it's so amazing that a female MC is bisexual especially in crime thrillers. I mean, how often do you see that? Not very often, that's how often!I really am starting to love crime thriller books and it's because of Roxane (and Tracy Crosswhite from the Tracy Crosswhite series). She is far from perfect, sure, but I don't expect my heroines to be perfect. She has a bit of drinking problem, never listens when she should and can be angry and rude for no reason. But that is why I love her. She knows who she is and doesn't change for anybody. She works on the changes for herself. The plot was far more interesting then the first book. Although the synopsis gives away a huge amount so it's just best to go in blind. Just don't bother with it all because the book has so many twists and turns. My head was spinning and I loved every minute of it. I also liked that this book had more of Roxane's personal life but it, in no way, took away from the main story. Cat was a major figure in this book. If you recall, she was the ex in the first book. I didn't like Cat in the first book. I thought she was horrible for Roxane and I thought she was selfish. However, she had a bit of a redemption arc and you all know I am here for character arcs. By the end, I found myself rooting for them. Something I definitely didn't see coming. I had to deduct half a star because Roxane can get a little wordy and repeat a lot of what she says while trying to figure out the mystery. It's not super bothersome but my eyes did glaz over huge paragraphs once or twice. Her way of solving a mystery was going over every detail over and over to see if she missed something. That is fine, don't get me wrong, but it's a bit difficult to read and my eyes were begging for paragraph breaks. Overall, this book was fantastic!

She's a master at natural dialogue, teetering on too natural for reading as it can be confusing in the absence of intonation, etc. This particular story entwined a large web of characters that left me wishing I'd mapped a flowchart, and it felt like a few, albeit minor, points remained loose ends?

Things get more complicated when the fiance is found shot to death on the street after having an argument with Roxane's employer. Worst yet, her employer's gun is missing and it might be the murder weapon. Roxane has to clear her client. As she begins to dig into Marin Strasser's background more questions than answers are found. She says she's an interior decorator but her business card has only a phone number and an email address and tracking down previous clients seems to show that she was stealing from them. And it looks like she has scammed her fiance Arthur Ungless out of $75,000 for \"wedding plans.\" Digging deeper leads to a previous marriage where she also tried some scams and left angry heirs behind. Roxane also uncovers some illegal activity going on at Arthur's printing business. Apparently an employee had decided to branch out by making illegal IDs, driver's licenses, and passports. This brought the business to the attention of a local criminal which resulted in the death of the criminal's daughter and which brings Roxane to the criminal's attention.Throw in Marin's son who is just out of prison and eager to find another scam and you have plots and twists all over the place. Roxane has scaled back her alcohol use in this one but she is also really lonely. Her relationship with Tom, one of her father's proteges, has changed since he's found a new girlfriend and her relationship with a former girlfriend is also in a precarious situation. The girlfriend is trying to contact Roxane but Roxane isn't sure if she wants to get involved with her again. I enjoyed the twists and turns in this mystery.

One that carefully paces the clues and lets you guess where it's headed right before it makes a sharp twist that you never saw coming. One that has enough character development that you care enough become deeply invested in the suspenseful parts. What You Want to See has all this, plus a badass female PI in Roxane Weary. The book is set in Columbus, which makes it especially fun when Roxane goes to places I've been or at least driven by. It makes her feel even more real, as if she's walking down the same city streets that I do, which is a unique feeling since Columbus is a great town for artists but still doesn't have a lot of novels that take place here. Likewise, there aren't a lot of books that feature bisexual protagonists as well drawn and three dimensional as Weary. It's an absolute pleasure to sink into a mystery where queer people exist as regular people (not plot devices or villians). I loved Roxane in the first book, and it's great to see her back for another round of crime solving. She's in the process of cleaning up her act (a little) and a bit further along in trying to make peace with her father's death. But these tenuous footholds on a slightly more together existence are threatened when she stumbles into a case that starts as a garden variety suspected infidelity, then balloons into (no spoilers) a host of other crimes.The action is fast-paced, the family drama is well crafted, and the mystery keeps you guessing till the end. The supporting cast is fantastic--Shelby and Andrew are particular favorites of mine--and seeing another side of Catherine Walsh was a complete delight. The rogues gallery of adversaries that Roxane takes on in this book are also top notch, and the tension that builds as the story unfolds and brings everything to a head makes the book impossible to put down.It's the mark of an excellent series when you finish one book and immediately start checking to see when the next one will be coming out, and I'm sure I'm not the only reader who is already eagerly awaiting the next Roxane Weary mystery."}, {"userName": "Kathy ", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/971945-kathy", "userReview": "What You Want to See is Kristen Lepionka\u2019s second novel and second in the series of private investigator Roxane Weary. Having fallen hard for P.I. Weary in the first book, The Last Place You Look, I opened the second story with elevated expectations, but also a niggling fear. Following up a great debut is no easy task. It became clear in the first few pages of book #2 that this is a series of sustaining substance. Kristi\u2019s writing genius is no fluke; it\u2019s genuine and thrilling. Sophomore slump is nowhere in sight.After an emotionally and physically exhausting first case, Roxane Weary was able to get some more work from the publicity. But, publicity is wearing thin, and Roxane needs some cash flow, so she takes on a simple case of a man wondering if his lady love is straying. Arthur Ungless, owner of a printing shop, hires Roxane to follow his fianc\u00e9e, Marin Strasser, to either get the goods on her or ease his mind about being cheated on. Easy peasy, but no. Roxane is a magnet for the complicated, as demonstrated in her personal life. Torn between her dead father\u2019s last partner in the police department, Tom, and longtime love interest, Catherine, nobody can accuse Roxane of being dull. Of course, the sometimes too much drinking doesn\u2019t help. But, when Marin Strasser is found shot on a Columbus side street, sobering thoughts are called for. Roxane\u2019s client, Arthur Ungless is looking rather good as the prime suspect, but being familiar with the more twisted scheme of cases, Roxane is certain that the case isn\u2019t as straightforward as the police think. She is sure of Arthur\u2019s innocence and ready to take on Marin\u2019s family, the Columbus cops(including Tom), and the local mafia to prove it. Of course, there is the matter of the bounced check that Arthur paid her with to straighten out.Kristi Lepionka can write. Who chooses the setting to be Columbus, Ohio? Well, an author who can bring fast, thrilling action and multi-layered storytelling to the page with a complex main character you\u2019d follow to any setting, that\u2019s who. Roxane Weary is a troubled character, but she\u2019s finding a balance, being more grounded and less drunk than in the first book and making better decisions in her personal life. I love that Lepionka has given Roxane a sense of humor and some sass, as it adds strength to her already capable self. I\u2019m so pleased with how Roxane\u2019s bisexuality is portrayed, too. It\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve read about in many characters, and I find its seamless integration into the story refreshing. There are no billboards here announcing it; it just flows naturally, like it should.And, speaking of characters, I highly recommend reading the first book of this series so you can appreciate the carry-over of connections made from that story line. In What You Want to See there is more of Roxane\u2019s family dynamics, and Roxane is still struggling with her dead father\u2019s secrets and their relationship. Tom and Catherine are both back, but Roxane is less of a mess about them, which bodes well for her future. And, Roxane even finds some time to help a teenage girl she encountered in her horrific first case. Kristen Lepionka has entered the building, and she has proved she will be a continuing source of great sleuthing for readers with each new show. Readers of Kristi Belcamino\u2019s Gia Santella will be instant fans of Roxane Weary."}, {"userName": "Roxanne", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870392-roxanne", "userReview": "Thank you to Netgalley and Minotaur Books for a copy of the eARC in exchange for a fair review.Roxane is back, she had been tailing Marin to see if she was being unfaithful until the client's check bounced.

I have liked Roxanne (the main character) since I read Kristen Lepionka's first book, The Last Place You Look. But, I have liked the characters more than I have liked the story itself.In What You Want To See, we pick up shortly after book one left off. Roxanne is onto a new case with a new web of clients that she needs to untangle. The case is complex but Lepionka does a great job of taking you on Roxanne's ride - feeling what Roxanne feels and solving the case along side her. There are a lot of people and components to this new case and it makes the reader feel almost as hopeless as Roxanne does when she's trying to solve the murder that her client (didn't actually) hired her to solve. At first, she was tailing a women whom her client suspected of cheating. Then, she finds herself trying to solve her murder.Now, if you're like me, you read a lot. I liked that book 2 brought back characters from book 1 (and I don't like when a sequel takes half the book to explain the first book) BUT, I found myself trying to wrack my brain around what happened in book 1. I have read a lot of books since the first book in this series came out, and I couldn't remember a good chunk of what the author was referring to in book 2. I was able to remember the main components, but not the details that I felt like I needed. The plus was that I really liked the characters that were brought back, I just wish the author had taken a little bit more time to paint the end picture of book one. I felt like I was missing essential pieces. I didn't love the case itself - sure, it was interesting. And sure, I was definitely surprised by certain aspects towards the end, but I wasn't on the edge of my seat trying to figure out who the culprit was. There were a lot of characters who were fighting to attention and I sometimes had to go back to remember who I was reading about. The case just didn't pull me in as much as I would have hoped.One thing I like most about Roxanne's character is that she's bisexual. This isn't something that's written about too often - especially in a murder/mystery genre - but I loved exploring Roxanne's sexuality. It adds a dimension to this book and this genre that I hadn't experienced before. It was interesting liking both Cat and Tom at the same time (Roxanne's pesky love triangle). Usually, I am either one team or the other, but in this case I actually liked Cat (even though I didn't want to because of her actions in book one) and Tom is really hard not to adore. The relationship between Roxy and her two lovers is fun to read. Overall, I liked the book but I didn't love it. However, if we see Roxy come back again in a third installment, I will be reading it."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22094171-victoria", "userReview": "Honestly, Roxane Weary's stories are the only mystery contemporary series that I read.

It just didn't seem as complex & intriguing as I had hoped. Loved Roxane's relationship with Shelby & of course the positive bi-rep with an interesting predicament of liking Cat & Tom at the same time.

It does not impact my review.I really enjoyed Kristen Lepionka\u2019s debut book of the Roxane Weary series, The Last Place You Look, and I think I liked this one even better.I\u2019m not going to share the synopsis here because I think it gives way too much of the plot away. While I think it would be best to start with the first book in the series to have a better handle on Roxane\u2019s relationships, romantic and otherwise, the mystery is self-contained to this book and could be read as a standalone. Roxane is a private investigator who recently closed a very high profile case. She\u2019s taken a much more low-key job \u2013 trailing a possible cheating fianc\u00e9. The case spirals into something much more dangerous and Roxane finds herself caught up in the middle of it.I really enjoyed the twisty mystery in this. There were just so many layers that kept being revealed. It had the potential to get really out of hand, but Lepionka juggled it all really well. In a lot of mysteries I read these days I have everything all figured out pretty early on, but this one kept me guessing. While there were a few things I might have predicted, there were lots of other things I didn\u2019t. I kind of liked just reading it and being surprised, instead of trying to figure out every little thing. I thought the pacing was well done and there was never a time I felt like something drug on too long. I did think the ending was jut a tiny bit rushed, though, and thought there were a couple of loose ends that weren\u2019t tied up quite as neatly as I would\u2019ve liked them to have been.I thought Roxane was a little more likable in this book, as well. She seems to be working on her alcohol issues (most of the time, anyways) and she appears a little more self-aware. She had some good character growth, which I appreciated. I\u2019m still not thrilled with her romantic interests, though (yes, there\u2019s two). I really, really disliked Catherine in the previous book. She just seemed like an awful person who was no good at all for Roxane. She was a little better and a little more self-aware, too, this time around, but I think she\u2019s still technically married and I\u2019m just not on that ship. I do like Tom, as a character, but he also is in a relationship with someone else. To be fair, there were not any real romantic moments between he and Roxane in this book, but there\u2019s still obvious chemistry that seems a little inappropriate given his relationship status. If he breaks up with his girlfriend, though, I think I could really root for him to be with Roxane.Overall, I really enjoyed What You Want to See. It was well-paced and well-written, with a really interesting mystery. I also love that this book is set in Columbus, OH and I recognized a lot of the areas mentioned. I definitely recommend this series to Mystery fans and am looking forward to reading more from Lepionka in the future.Overall Rating (out of 5): 4 Stars"}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/587456-samantha", "userReview": "When I saw that Kristen Lepionka had written a follow up to The Last Place You Look I was excited and couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy. Thankfully Netgalley and St. Martin's Press provided me with a copy for my honest review.

I think the first book might have had a bit more suspense and tension but this was well played out, started out with a mundane cheating investigation and turned into a murder mystery with complex twist and turns.

Hired by a man who suspects his fianc\u00e9e is cheating on him the last thing she expects is detectives to turn up her door demanding answers about the woman\u2019s murder, which comes as news to Roxane...\u201cSurveillance work was nothing but an odd, shaded view into someone\u2019s life, like watching television with the sound off.\u201dAfter four days spent watching Marin Strasser, \u2018purveyor of sophisticated interior decor\u2019 mooch between a variety of furniture stores, take a hot yoga class and speak to exactly nobody, the retainer check of her fianc\u00e9e, ex-marine and print shop owner, Arthur Ungless has bounced curtailing Roxane\u2019s close attentions. Marin\u2019s unlikely fianc\u00e9e is a barrel-chested sixty-year-old and when it becomes evident that stunning Marin is fifteen-years his junior, well out of his league and has fleeced him of $75,000, Detective Ed Sanko thinks the case is as open and shut as it first appears. However on the basis of Roxane\u2019s conversations with a gullible Arthur and the scant few possessions or evidence of Marin\u2019s online existence, Roxane keeps digging, convinced that the hapless Arthur is the fall guy and determined to prove his innocence. Unwilling to leave him high and dry (as with Joshua and Shelby in her first case), Roxane looks into the mystery of Marin and after an inauspicious haul of her possessions (a cigar box, a stack of slips containing QR codes and a locket containing the picture of a small boy), she finds a heck of a lot more that she is bargaining for. When visiting Arthur at his print shop coincides with a double shooting leaving Arthur in critical condition, the nineteen-year-old daughter of a small time real estate and payday loan mogul dead and Ungless Printing crawling with fraud detectives, Frank\u2019s protective ex-partner Tom (and Roxane\u2019s occasional sexmate) warns her to stay out of a potentially very dangerous case.. Naturally Roxane\u2019s wilfully ignores the simplest of instructions..When Roxanne discovers that the sister of the deceased girl, Derek, works a Arthur\u2019s print shop and was recommended for the job by a now discredited ex-employer, Leila Hassan, who was apparently friends with Marin, she starts to make inroads. As checking out the scene of Marin\u2019s murder leads to Roxane stumbling on her secret past, namely two marriages and a criminal career as a con artist, she is even more determined to protect Arthur. Engaged in a long running inheritance war with her ex in-laws and with a duplicitous, malicious and homicidal son, Nate, recently out of prison and up to his neck in both matters, pretty soon Roxane seems to know more that the cops about just who Marin Strasser really was. However linking the threads between Leila, what went down at the print shop and Arthur\u2019s fleecing means finding Leila and with Roxane\u2019s capricious and irresistible on/off girlfriend, Catherine (\u201cCat\u201d) Walsh, a mutual Facebook friend, resisting the lure proves impossible, well aware that any encounter with Catherine usually leaves her emotionally hurt.. Historically unfaithful, Catherine is not however unchanged from the first novel and showcases a different and potentially more healthy aspect of her attachment to Roxane with the sparks of intimacy and electricity just as realistic. Convinced that in a case of precious little evidence, a truckload of rumours and muddied by some more often that faked official documents the answer to the whole shakedown lies in understanding why and just whom murdered Marin Strasser, once again Roxane gets in way over her head, and this time her nearest and dearest are left feeling the effects. Roxane is an engaging and supremely likeable character, all the most so for the fact that she is both fallible and not invincible, meaning her tricky situations are not the usual foregone conclusions of standard PI fare and often have associated collateral damage. Given that the majority of PI\u2019s show no propensity to change and resort to type at the slighted test, Roxane makes a refreshing thoughtful protagonist. All the more appealing is that Lepionka never come close to making the novel all about Roxane and her cases bring emotional baggage, the burden of responsibility and genuine personal reflection. Between acting as a surrogate aunt and less than responsible queer role model for lonely teenage, Shelby, who became attached to her in a traumatic last encounter, and navigating her history with Tom, Roxane has her hands full aside from the conundrum of Catherine.The pace is breakneck, Roxane\u2019s first-person narrative is as tight as it comes and drips with sarcasm and the characters are further developed upon and tested, bringing credible insights, and the chemistry between Roxane and both Catherine and Tom authentic. That Roxane\u2019s sexuality isn\u2019t bandied around and made an issue of is to Lepionka\u2019s credit as the temptation to market this aspect as a selling point setting Roxane apart from fellow PI\u2019s must be immense. However, given that Roxane is also a self-destructive, impulsive, troubled and frankly obsessive character who muddles through the disorganised chaos that passes for her life liberally fuelled by whiskey, her sexuality barely seems worthy of a mention!An electrifying encounter with a plot as well-crafted as her debut, first-class characterisation and a grandstanding denouement, What You Want To See is every bit a vibrant and smart as The Last Place You Look. A follow up that consolidates and impresses with its non-linear narrative and round the houses route to the answers!

Roxane, a private detective, is struggling with a drinking habit, sorting out recent past relationships with Charlotte and Tom, a complicated family, and her police officer father's recent murder. And this doesn't even come close to what she has to face when she is hired by Arthur Ungless, small print shop owner, to determine if his fiance, Marin Strasser, is cheating on him. Pretty routine in her line of work, until Arthur's retainer check bounces, his fiance is murdered and the real mysteries begin.

Connections to a mafia-like family, elaborately planned estate takeovers, forgery and murder piles up around Roxane who continues to wade through to the truth.
