Keep in mind that I am not a huge fan of Christian romances, so take my review with a grain of salt. Not really liking the genre is a huge bias.I requested the galley because of the blurb that it was about a baker with diabetes who could never eat more than a bite of her creations. I thought this was very clever, and could work as a metaphor for forbidden love or love that is ultimately bad for you, or a million other typical romance scenarios. I was extremely disappointed that Emma Rae's diabetes have almost nothing to do with the story.I had forgotten that this was billed as a Christian romance when I began reading this, at first the mentions of God and the redeeming power of prayer felt natural and I went with it, then they got more and more to the point where I skipped over those parts. When I read Christian romance it is mostly mail order bride and homesteader stuff because I like those plot points and I will read them however I get them, so it is clear that my taste is not in Christian contemporary. Had the religion been kept to the two main characters and a pastor character, then perhaps I would have accepted it, but as the book goes on, every single character, including the goth girl, is a devout Christian who prays constantly for their friend's welfare.The cooking and business aspects of the book were fun and interesting, I loved watching this hotel be built from the ground up (not literally, the building is in place) and I liked that the hero and heroine were friendly and comfortable with eachother for the most part. They appreciated each others skills and hard work. The lists and recipes and other filler material threw me out of the story, and I think the book would be much stronger without cliched lists of popular bridal favors. Blech.(I received a free electronic galley from NetGalley. This has not biased my review in any way)Edit: Down to two stars based on how I feel now that I finished the book a while ago and can sit on it."}, {"userName": "Jen.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62576597-jen", "userReview": "..Adorable characters!

I guess it's fate, or maybe even divine, as far as books go, because reading them almost consecutively gives me an idea on how different YA/MG chick lit is to adult chick lit.You know another funny thing? There seemed to be a lot of Christian chick lit that is set in the South. Atlanta, specifically. Maybe it's because there are more writers from that area? Or is it because it's just a charming place to set a story in, because in this book, I am charmed. :)Emma Rae Travis is an award-winning contradiction -- she's the best baker in town, but she's also diabetic, so she isn't allowed to eat more than three bites of her baked confections. But the real point of the story isn't her diabetes, but her baked goods and how it helped her meet Jackson Drake, owner of the new Tanglewood Hotel. Pretty soon, Emma is a part of the hotel staff and with Jackson's crazy and efficient sisters, her semi-goth best friend Fiona and her separated parents...well, it's a circus, alright.I love myself a good chick lit, obviously, as it's the genre I really started loving in the first place. I found that I hardly get to read much chick lit though, because there doesn't seem to be many quality chick lit out there. It's easy for chick lit to be stereotyped because it seems like there's only one story line for all books like that. I beg to differ, though, because there's a plethora of stories that can be written under that genre. You don't need a fashionista girl with a gay best friend living in a busy city working as a writer looking for Mr. Right for a book to be chick lit!This is why I liked Always the Baker, Never the Bride because it doesn't fall under the usual chick lit stereotype. Sure, the leading man is handsome, and sure there's a crazy family, but I liked that Emma is her own person, and she's not a fashion slave. Emma is a bright and strong protagonist, one that I can't help but get attached to as I read the book. The best thing I loved about Emma? She's a baker! I bake, too, so that is definitely something I can relate to, but I am sure I won't be as good as her because my cakes tend to fall apart before I can even get them out of the oven. :PThe Christian aspect of this novel is well written, too, and I liked how it wasn't preachy. Prayer was subtly incorporated, and Jackson's grief and fears were real for a guy his age and with his experience. Emma's religious conflict, though, felt a bit blurry. By blurry, I wasn't sure why she was having the conflict in the first place -- maybe I missed it in the first few pages? I wasn't sure if it was because she didn't grow up in that environment or she lost it along the way, so her religious transformation didn't leave a mark in me as much as I wanted it to. I do like the romantic dynamics explained in this novel, though, especially the concept of After Care. Ever wondered why some guys act so sweet and do something special and then disappear afterwards (and it drives us crazy that we over think so much)? That is after care. :P I'd leave you to read the book to understand what it is, but if you're really curious, I may just explain it off the review. :PThis is a cute and fluffy read, and the romance was nice and well-developed, too. However, I felt a bit underwhelmed by the end. I was waiting for a big \"oomph\", a big conflict that would wreak havoc with Emma and Jackson and everything they worked for, but I felt like it never came. I also felt that Emma's diabetes wasn't properly spotlighted, but maybe that wasn't really the point of the story, so I could let that go. I just didn't find the game-changing (and sometimes tears-inducing) climax that I found in the other Christian chick lit books I read this year in this one, so that part just kind of made this just okay. It wasn't bad, I wasn't disappointed, but I felt that it needed a bit more to make it more memorable.Always the Baker, Never the Bride is already out paperback.

If I had paid for this, I would've been upset. First, the editing needs work. The business of putting quotes from two different people in the same paragraph was annoying. The random italics (the \"southernisms\" from Jackson's sisters, Eliza and Prof Higgins when talking about My Fair Lady) - why? And why pray tell do only Jackson's sisters have a southern accent in print? Some of the word choices were odd as well, odd enough to jar the reader out of the story. Second, making the heroine diabetic - why? what's the point, other than to be able to tell the reader about how to take care of diabetes? Again, interrupted the flow of the story. Oh and by the way, this is Christian fiction - I'm new to my kindle, and seems like an awful lot of the free ebooks are Christian. Not my thing, don't like to read them. This one wasn't overpowering until well into the book, but when it came time to resolve the plot, God just marched right in and prayer solved all of the problems, boom, boom, boom. The little interludes between the chapters - recipes, wedding tips, and do I remember correctly, stuff on diabetes (??)- ewww, I totally started skipping them. Don't know why I finished this, probably because all of this didn't become annoying until 2/3 of the way in - by that time I realized I didn't have far to go and just plowed through. And the ending, ewww again - tying it all up with Emma wondering if she would always be the baker, or whether she would finally be a bride. Come on, we get it, you don't need to be that explicit. The tradition in romances (at least as far as I can tell) is that the title isn't ever explicitly referenced, and much of the time the title has little to nothing to do with the story."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5442967-shelley", "userReview": "So this book was not at all what i expected. As a baker i decided to read this as i thought that it would be about some kick ass baker chick with some romance on the side. What it turned out to be was a kick ass baker chick and God. To be fair i was given this ebook in a file with heaps of others so i only read the blurb on the back before i decided to read it, it wasn't until i finished it and realised that it is published by a christian themed publisher, that it clicked for me that i had been tricked. The God bashing starts off as subtle. It isn't until about three quarters of the way through that it has pretty much become the theme of the book. By the time i realised that i had been tricked i decided that i might as well finish it, i have no problem with christian books however i think that they should be marketed as such and if God is going to be the main theme of the story then it should have been clear at the outset. As for the actual story line i was disappointed. A bunch of adult, successful women discussing the reluctance of men to commit and being in a stage called aftercare? Really? I think that this is actually pretty demeaning to women. Especially when the advice given to the main character on how to deal with her love interest's issues is basically just mind fuckery. I mean if he ignores you then you should just play along and let him. What the Hell. What happened to the idea that adults who are looking at entering into a relationship be open and honest with each other? Instead she should just ignore the man in question and prey to God for help. Even without the religion this book was terrible."}, {"userName": "Lydia (Overweight Bookshelf)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4230224-lydia-overweight-bookshelf", "userReview": "First reviewed here: http://overweight-bookshelf.blogspot....Perfect balance of cutting Southern wit, sweet friendships and delectable romance (with some yummy recipes thrown in to coax us into a diabetic coma). This is a book based around relationships: parent-child, friends, spouses, siblings, and coworkers. I love how realistically Sandra Bricker portrays the development (and sustainment) of each relationship in this book, avoiding most cliches that are usually rampant in chick-lit. Emma and Jackson don't trifle with each other or resort to silly games. Their relationship is rooted in friendship and grows naturally based on honesty and true affection. Jackson's struggle with consolidating his love for his late wife and his new love for Emma is heartfelt and sincere. Every woman would love to have an authentic friendship like Emma has with the unconventional Fee. Emma's parents and lovable aunt, Jackson's sisters and Chef Morelli appear dysfunctional on the surface, but beneath lies an unbreakable family bond. The discourse between characters is laced with dry humor and very fast passed, grasping the reader's attention until the last crumb of cake has been consumed. I highly recommend this book, especially if you love to bake. The recipes and tips at the end of each chapter will definitely be put to good use this holiday season.

I was really sleepy when I started reading (about 11 pm)...I thought \"I'll just read a couple of chapters, just get it started and finish it tomorrow.\" That's not how it worked!! I became so wrapped up in it that I finished it in one sitting. After each chapter, I'd say to myself, \"One more.\" One more turned into another and another till I turned the last page about 3 a.m.This book contained everything I enjoy in a read: romance, lovable characters, humor, quirkiness, food, clean language, and so much more.I loved Emma (I could relate to her in so many ways!)... I absolutely fell in love with Jackson. I even enjoyed all of the secondary characters: Especially Fee and Sophie. I laughed out loud while reading this so many times! :-DI look forward to reading more from Mrs. Bricker, but now I know better than to start one when I need sleep, ha!

Emma Rae is an award winning pastry chef and baker who is hired to work at a remodeled all inclusive wedding destination hotel in Atlanta called the Tanglewood Inn. Her boss, Drake, is a handsome yet serious widower who is slightly in over his head starting up his deceased wife's dream of owning and remodeling the inn. With the help of his eccentric older sisters and the sweet and beautiful Emma Rae, they open the inn to high praises. There is an undeniable attraction between Emma Rae and Drake, but can he move past comparing Emma to his late wife? Can God really have a plan for him to have another love in his life?

And she has just landed an amazing gig as the head baker at a brand new hotel. This is a place for Emma to express her creativity, expand her horizons and fall in love? Of course Emma\u2019s boss is a total hottie, but there are a couple of things holding them back. 1. Is is wrong to date your boss? and 2. Less than two years ago, his wife died of cancer. Is it too soon?I have never really been one to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, but recently I have been trying my hand at cupcakes. They have turned out pretty spectacular, if I do say so myself. But I never thought I would be interested in books that focus on a cook, chef or baker. This is the second book from NetGalley that I have read that has had recipes between the chapters, and I absolutely love them. After I write this post, I am going to pull the book back up and get the recipe for Emma\u2019s Mocha Latte Cookies. Doesn\u2019t the name just sound delicious? And they are dipped in chocolate! I can\u2019t wait to make them.I have a bad habit of not reading the summary of the book, so based on title, I was surprised with this story. I thought it was going to be more about a baker\u2019s bad dates, but it was so much more and I loved it! It was cute, southern and there were a few love stories thrown in.Although this is more of a girly, cooking, weddingy book, this is a book of growth for a man who lost his wife. Not that you ever want to tell someone it\u2019s time to move on, this would be a great book to do just that. I hope that I would never have to give this to a friend, but I am sure at some point, someone will lose someone and hopefully I will remember this book to pass on.This book is also good for diabetics. Emma is a diabetic, who bakes with sweets on a daily basis. She considers it a naughty trick from God. I would hate to not be able to eat the goodies I bake. But Emma does just that. She allows herself a sliver, but deals with it. It may not be a huge part of the story, but it\u2019s a nice story for diabetics to show that you can do anything that anyone else can. My brother needs to read this!Now I mentioned the recipes between the chapters. I find myself really liking books that have something to break up the chapters. In this book, there were recipes and since Emma bakes for weddings, different tips for weddings. Some of which I wish I had for my wedding (which our year anniversary is about a month and a half away wow). There was a list of some more non-traditional ways to get married, like have a murder mystery dinner or do it in the morning and have tea. There was also a list of wedding favors. My favorite was small packs of coffee with personalized labels that say \u201cA Perfect Blend\u201d. Isn\u2019t that adorable?I give Always the Baker Never the Bride 5 bookmarks.

Do we have to categorize everything that has Christian characters as a Christian book? The main characters in this one are just as annoyed by what they perceive as a pushy pastor as any of these reviewers are. They have just as much resentment against any talk of God. They are regular people who blame God for the tragedies they've been through and explore that a very little bit during this funny, well-paced book. It makes me think of an an acquaintance who would like a warning label on anything that mentions Christianity, but exempts all other religions from that requirement. I've been guilty of this myself: if it talks about Christianity it's evil proselytizing, but if it features a Hindu or Pagan or Jewish character, it's great and a fun insight into other perspectives. This isn't logical, it's pure resentment. Not being able to abide a book on any of those terms isn't something we should be proud of. From purely bookish perspective, this was great, fun chick lit. For me, it was noteworthy for being able to use those dorky foodie interstitials in a way that usually helped the plot along and contributed to the atmosphere - instead of just throwing recipes in because they're expected in a foodie novel. It was genuinely funny, and the characters - again, unusually for chick lit- were a normal amount of dysfunctional, instead of being insanely codependent. I enjoyed accompanying them through their growing relationships. And the food didn't hurt.Yes, the characters talked at little bit about prayer at times, but in a way that was consistent with their characters and normal for people in general, especially in the South. I've read books where the characters are put through an obvious religious awakening in order to carry that message to the readers, which is very much for specific tastes.

Bricker. There is just something about weddings that is sort of magical, isn't there. Unfortunately my wedding wasn't all that magical, so I think that is why I enjoy reading stories about them! I love living vicariously through my books!At first glance, you might think that this series is going to be similar to that of Nora Robert's Series, The Bride Quartet. For those of you that read her series, you will see some similarities:1. Each series is about weddings;2. Each is about a specific person that helps to plan weddings;3. Each takes place in a venue that holds weddings.But that is where the similarities end. Starting with \"Always the Baker, Never the Bride\" we meet Emma Rae who has just won a very prestigious award that is about to put her on the \"Pastry Chef Map\" as it were. What makes this so remarkable is that she has rarely tasted any of her creations, if at all, so she must rely on her trusty sidekick, Fiona, to taste everything for her. Currently working at a popular bakery, she meets Jackson Drake, who stops in for a coffee and some delicious treats that he takes back to his business...a run down hotel that he is renovating to it's former glory.Okay, I guess we can see where this is going, at least I can. I've read enough romance novels to know where each is going to end up. What is wonderful about this series though is that it is Christian-based, so it is a sweet romance that leaves the intimacies up to the imagination rather than put in print.

She's won awards for her wedding cakes. Too bad she's diabetic and can't really eat much of what she creates. Jackson Drake, with the help of his three southern sisters, has taken on a project to honor his dead wife. He's bought a hotel and is turning it into a wedding hotel -- offering any service a bride could possibly want. Emma Rae can't resist Jackson's offer to come work for him as his pastry chef.Emma Rae's friend and sous chef, the emo Fiona, adds some spark to the mix of characters which are somewhat cliche. The romance is very slow, and builds in a cute and natural way. The idea of the wedding hotel was my favorite part -- I loved all the ideas they came up with for the setting, food, and atmosphere. There are recipes and baking tips between the chapters that were interesting but not important to the story.I didn't, however, realize Always the Baker, Never the Bride was considered Christian fiction. It's not that I have a problem with that, but I usually don't read anything labeled Christian fiction -- and I felt blindsided. It wasn't heavy -- but there was a lot of emphasis on praying, and relying on God that some might not enjoy. And, I just don't like that in my books. I AM a Christian, so that's not what it's about. I just don't like reading about being Christian.

I love a story that can do that. The dialog between characters was so witty and filled with humor. A very entertaining read.Emma works in a bakery for a cranky boss. Emma has just won the prestigious Passionate Palette award for one of her mouthwatering wedding cakes. A cake that Emma has only had a taste of since she is a diabetic. Emma's eccentric friend Fiona also works at the bakery. When Emma reads about the Tanglewood hotel opening up and in need of a baker she sees it as her and Fiona's chance to shine and show her true baking abilities, with hopefully a less cranky boss.Jackson doesn't know what to think of Emma when he stumbles into the bakery that she works in. He sees her as an annoyance when she tries to get him to drink hazelnut coffee instead of the plain black coffee he asked for. When she shows up at his hotel to apply for the job of baker he is less than thrilled. But some things are out of Jackson's hands, mainly his 3 sisters! Emma has charmed her way to their hearts and they just know that if Jackson hires her the Tanglewood will have it's start in making a name for itself.The book really becomes entertaining once the sisters become involved and once Emma's \"divorced\" parents arrive.

Great complex family relationships portrayed. The author includes several characters who are dealing with past relationships and seeking balance in order to live fully in the present. PLUS mouth-watering food described and some great recipes! What's not to love?! There is a thread of God's loving watch-care over individual's lives, and the power of prayer throughout the book. The main characters are still grappling with their faith, and the secondary characters who are more closely following Christ very gently and naturally share their faith with them. The only \"heavy\" spiritual conversations include the pastor who is quite naturally concerned for the characters because of his relationship to them as family (or potential family) members.My only complaint would have to be with the southern accents sporadically voiced throughout the book. The author need to either voice them, or not, and be consistent. As a southerner myself it bothered me that some of the characters seemed to have accents on one page and not on the next. Yes, we southern gals do lay it on a little thicker at times to wheedle our way into little 'ole unsuspectin' hearts, but it was not clear that was what was being portrayed.Overall, I'd say this is a winner! I can't wait for the next in the series!"}, {"userName": "\u0251\u01a8\u0127\u0175\u0251\u0261 \u2665Team Magnus Damora FOREVER\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4676971-team-magnus-damora-forever", "userReview": "The reason i picked up Always the Baker, Never the Bride was pretty simple. I was in a mood of a lottle fluffy. Turns out this dose of fluffy-ness is so much greater than I need. It is one of those books where you can feel how deep the characters can be yet the writing manages to keep the lightness. There's grief and there's heartbreak but Emma and Jackson find each other. This is clearly a Christian Fiction, which i an grateful for my bestie for mentioning it, (i don't really pay that much attention to genres xD) and added to the fact that's i'd never pick such books, i kept asking myself why did I keep reading it? I just realized upon finishing it, that i do like anyone who's name is Jackson, pretty silly but it's true. And also the romance bits were nice if you just skip the uncomfortable stuff"}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6137018-kara", "userReview": "A cute romance that had me drooling for cakes and sweets :) Jackson's sisters are a little over the top, but they add family cuteness to the story. Love Emma and Fiona's personalities, they were my favorite characters in the story. Even though this book is a light read, it offers charm, intrigue, and even a few secrets in the plot that I didn't see coming at all. I'm looking forward to reading Always the Wedding Planner, Never the Bride....love the book covers in this series :)"}, {"userName": "Patti", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2783714-patti", "userReview": "If you want wedding advice or to drool over descriptions of delicious cakes, go read this. If you want a love story, I don't think you'll find a good one here. I had to fast forward after I reached the mid-point of the book---nothing was happening! I kept waiting for the pace to pick up or for the relationship to bloom, but nothing. It was stale and just not a good read for me.

But here's the rub about her job as a baker ... Emma is diabetic. When she tastes her creations, it can only be in the most minute portions. Emma is considered an artisan for the stunning crEme brulee wedding cake that won her the Passionate Palette Award last year, but she's never even had one full slice of it.When Jackson Drake hears about this local baker who has won a prestigious award for her wedding cake artistry, he tells his assistant to be sure and include her in the pastry tastings scheduled at his new wedding destination hotel the following week. And for Jackson, that particular day has started out badly with two workmen trapped in a broken elevator and a delivery of several dozen 300-thread-count bed linens in the wrong size abandoned in the lobby. But when the arrogant baker he met a week prior in Roswell stumbles into the dining room with a platter of pastries and a bucketful of orders, he knows for certain: It's going to be a really rotten day.Can these two ill-suited players master the high-wire act and make a go of their new business venture? Or will they take each other crashing downward, without a net? And will the surprise wedding at The Tanglewood be theirs?", "title": "Always the Baker, Never the Bride\n      \n          (Emma Rae Creations #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7893113-always-the-baker-never-the-bride", "average": 3.65, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385599003l/7893113.jpg", "reviews": 668, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/773189.Sandra_D_Bricker", "name": "Sandra D.
