Miners' families were collateral damage in a war against the earth itself . . .\"There are a few things preventing me from giving this addictively readable book a solid four star rating. Mostly minor niggles: choppy (but not sloppy) chapter-transitions; cut-and-splice fractured timeline - a pet peeve of mine; minor line-editing hiccups; Nothing tragic. \"Some things in life are good and some are bad and they all get thrown into the stew and you try to eat around the gristle. God doesn't give us the option of a Sunday Potluck where you pick what you want and leave the rest.\"I've teetered back and forth between a three and four star rating. Three seems kinda harsh, considering the high, Goodreads average rating for this particular novel. Yet four would be a bit too generous - comparing apples to apples. Because there is a BIG DOOZY glitch I cannot overlook: an unresolved major plot point/twist WOWZER that was left lamely hanging.Now, in all fairness, the WOWZER gas station \"event\" was a good one. It ramped up suspense and kept me turning pages lickity-split to find out what would happen to Ruby on the road to Beulah. It was well placed and primarily written aptly. But then..... the WOWZER suddenly (and conveniently) resolved - serendipitously and heroically, I might add - then simply faded into the background to nothing. Which made it seem like the whole thing was simply written in by suggestion of the editor to give some oomph to the plot and ramp up suspense. A gimmicky ploy, in my opinion. HOWEVER . . . I'm in the minority. Everyone has their own bait and hook, tolerance levels. Mine leaves little room for manipulative shortcuts. Of course, it could be that I'm being overly persnickety. After all, I enjoyed the book - primarily.I was fully invested in the story, and thought the narrative and relationship tangles rang true. It was entertaining and addictively readable. I kept wanting to know more and more about Ruby and Bean, Esau Script, the Shoes upstairs, and how it was all going to play out between the past and the present, the mine owners and miners, Ruby and her daughter Frances. So in essence, even with the BIG DOOZY, I still found this a good read. THREE **** Addictively Readable with a Charming, Curmudgeonly Main Character, and a Fascinating, Unique Story . . .

Fabulous, fantastic, you won't put it down. You have to read Bean and Ruby's story. Their stories intersect very well. Some of you will not see the end coming. You will be blown away with the ending!Not only does this need to be a movie, so much of it rings true to the coal mining area I lived in for many years. This has to be one of the very best researched books. The details are so vivid and it reads like no fiction book I have read in the past.If you read Hillbilly Elegy and enjoyed it, you are going to LOVE Under a Cloudless Sky it's so much better.This is a 5 star two times book.

The story focuses on Ruby, an 80 year old lady who left the town the day after the massacre, as a young girl, and has never been back. The story is told through the happenings of Ruby and her childhood friend Bean during 1933. As well as during 2004. Ruby is the daughter of an owner of the mine and Bean is the daughter of a miner.When Ruby\u2019s children decide it is time to take her car keys away from her, she makes the decision to go back to attend the dedication of the Company Store being turned into a museum. When she gets back to Beulah Mountain, she goes through the Company Store as well as the apartment she and her father lived in and the third floor of the building. One of the guides tells her the story they will tell others of what happened with the massacre on the third floor in 1933. They do not listen to her when she tells them it is not what happened. What she has to say will affect so many people. But the truth comes out.This is an exceptional story. It pulls you right into it and is very hard to put down. The friendship Ruby and Bean had was unusual, Ruby was a wealthy girl, while Bean\u2019s family struggled for everything they had. While Ruby\u2019s father wanted to run a mine that help the miners, his partner was only concerned about himself and money. I just really enjoyed this story! It is a story of friendship, faith, family and forgiveness. With this being a Christian Fiction, it is not preachy. I think anyone who enjoys reading stories set in the Appalachians will greatly enjoy this story.I received a copy of this book from Tyndale Publishing, this is my honest review."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5394427-joyce", "userReview": "Chris Fabry has written many books, is a best-selling author and hosts his own show on Moody Radio. This is my first read of his, hopefully the first of many.This is the story of two girls, best friends, in a coal-mining town in West Virginia, and what became of them. It is a fictitious story from the author's imaginings based on the lives of real people.To be perfectly honest I did not enjoy reading this book. But this is one of those books that stays with you and the characters grow in the reader's mind revealing the depth of the writing, which means it is very good. The story is dark in places, and deep, real life; with a hint of hope, faith and love. I love the use of the hymn Beulah Land in the book.It was difficult to keep track of the characters and understand the connections until the end (no spoilers). That is also a sign of good writing. By the end of the book I understood, and continue to understand as I mull it over.The parallel time periods might have been clearer if the chapter headings were larger, more bold. I'm tempted to re-read the book just to get the flow now that it makes sense. I think it was necessary to write this way to convey the message of the book, which is tightly woven into the story and characters, which are vivid, and the action moves right along. I identified most with the character of Frances. What character did you like best?I recommend this book for all readers of historical and Christian fiction, young and old.

Thank you very much!I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m not a big fan of books that flip back and forth from one time period to another. Heck, I don\u2019t even like watching shows on TV that go back and forth like that. For this book, though, it really worked and I was able to stay with the story line without getting lost (that\u2019s saying a lot of me). There\u2019s always something about a new Chris Fabry book that envelopes me when I sit down and crack it open. The story flows, the plot is flawless and the characters are flawed but redeemed in the end.

I really really liked it for so many reasons I really can\u2019t tell you. I mean, let\u2019s face it, there are things I question and some concerns I have but there are so many other things that I just take with the wind and don\u2019t even second guess. I mean, truly that\u2019s the way it is most of the time right? The problem is I don\u2019t have the words, any words much less all the words, to guide you through my time spent bonding with this book.Here\u2019s the deal. Let\u2019s start simple shall we. I love how the author set the book up with himself as the narrator and each chapter having a date and time and a snippet of what is happening. For example: Hollis takes the long way home Beluah Mountain, West Virginia Friday, October 1, 2004That\u2019s important because some of the things take place in other areas. It\u2019s also important because it helps to create a seamless transition between then (1933) and now (2004). Let\u2019s talk about those transitions shall we. They were seamless, each part of the story blended to the next, regardless of the date, in such a way that it was almost magical. It drew you like a moth to the flame but saved you from getting burnt. Each time period had scenes that were liveable, I could picture myself in their moments, bells even in their shoes as the characters were very well developed too boot.Storyline, I have to go there. I was about halfway through the book and on the phone with Kristin (you know this is a thing!) and I had already figured out one of the twists. Oh, yeah there are more twists and turns, hills and valleys than a county road through the Ozark Mountains (if you have never driven around Branson, MO you have no idea the crazy that is possible in road creation) but they are way easier on the tummy. Now back to Kristin, she\u2019s already read the book. In my infinite wisdom I tell her that I am going to tell her the outcome of \u2018Thing 1\u2019 (I\u2019m not giving you spoilers!) and she has to tell me if I\u2019m right just yes or no. Well the big Thing, Thing 1, totally nailed it before I was half done with the book. I think I impressed her with my mad skills and all. Probably not. Anyway, I had an inkling of a smaller but just as vital \u2018Thing 2\u2019. So I ask her and she says no. And she LIED to me! Lied I tell ya. She swears that she misunderstood my question and said her headache made her do it (ya right) but I was seriously doubting my deductive reasoning skills.Now that you seriously doubt my sanity and words putting together skills I\u2019m going to leave you with some closing thoughts. Never assume anything. Never leave a partially finished story on the table. When you do someone else might come through and rewrite the world you thought you knew. Never get so into who you think you are that you forget who you really are. This book embraced everything that I respect in fiction, real yet flawed characters with heart and soul and spunk and intelligence. There was that one thing that happened in the middle that enhanced the story not one wit but did create the endgame so to speak, it was a necessary distraction from the bigger picture (that could have been handled a number of different ways but still probably just a distraction). This book has a glimmer of coming of age that tangos with mystery and a slice of intrigue but cozies up as just an amazing weekend read.I was provided a complimentary copy of this book by Tyndale House Publishers.

The mine owners have the ups and the workers have the downs. But not all owners are unfair. Jacob Handley agreed to be a financial backer of the mine if he could put measures in place that would make it more fair for the workers, including housing, food and supplies from a company store, etc. However, other members felt that increasing the bottom line was the primary goal by whatever means necessary. Even so, a friendship between Handley\u2019s daughter, Ruby, and one of the mine workers daughters named Bean struck up and became inseparable. Through Bean\u2019s mama and their church, Ruby became saved and was baptized. They were inseparable, until an unfortunate series of events set a massacre in place that would change their lives forever.Several decades later in 2004, Hollis Beasley is trying to prevent the land in Beulah Mountain from being bought out by Coalman Coal and Energy. Unfortunately, the company has deep pockets with roots in the tax appraisal office that is making it impossible for the land owners to pay taxes on their land, forcing many to sell. Ruby Handley Freedman now lives in Kentucky and is fighting her children to keep her independence. Having not been back to Beulah Mountain since the massacre, the town has changed and the historical society has refurbished her old childhood home above the company store as a museum. Feeling the need to return for forgiveness as well as to prove to her children that she can still take care of herself, Ruby takes off with no notice to head to Beulah Mountain. This decisions starts a series of events that will change everyone\u2019s lives in Beulah Mountain just as the day she left.I have never been disappointed in a book by Chris Fabry, so it comes as no surprise that I quickly devoured this one as well. With a resounding theme of forgiveness throughout the book, Fabry weaves a tragic story planted with a seed of hope. I was so caught up in both stories that I couldn\u2019t pick which one I wanted to follow more. Fabry also did a great job taking me back to 2004 with the reference to Switchfoot as well as a few other tidbits such as internet browsers of the past. You don\u2019t realize how much your forget until you\u2019re confronted with it again. And yes, Meant to Live is still playing in my head now much like it did then.Ruby\u2019s story was humorous, suspenseful, and downright terrifying at times. To hear about the poor treatment of people at any time in history (or present) is never an enjoyable experience. However, we must learn what happened or we are doomed to repeat it. I also liked that he showed how people prefer to sugarcoat the bad and focus on the good. By understanding this, we can look past the surface and see the hurt that people are facing.I always enjoy books that allow me to have a bit of a prediction and this one was no exception. I\u2019m happy to say that my prediction of the story came true. However, there was a twist that also happened as part of the prediction, which made it even better.

When the congregation quieted, and the pastor began his sermon a commotion was heard through the open windows, \u201c\u2026the audible voices of miners shouting for help.\u201dThus, begins a story of faith, guilt, forgiveness and corporate greed as the people of Beulah Mountain are forced to sell family-owned land to Coalman Coal and Energy because of rising property taxes, job loss and hardship they blamed on the government.

It was an excellent story, which turned me into a fan. That's why I chose to review his latest book, and I just finished it last night.It's a gentle mystery, set in the Appalachian Mountains. I attended college near there, and the slow pace, scenery, and drawls match what I have in my memory. The story swings back and forth like a pendulum between 1933 and 2004, and does so with ease. It weaves friendship, tragedy, and faith together in a beautiful tapestry.In 1933, Ruby and Bean are two kindred sisters from different worlds. Ruby's father owns the general store in a coal mining town. She's a well-to-do town girl. Bean is from a poor family, living hand-to-mouth due to her father's drinking and carousing. The two girls love one another and dream together.The coal mining company controls the people in 1933 and in 2004. Hollis is fighting for the right to keep his land. His parents had deep roots here, and his son died in a mining accident. He can't let go, even though moving away may be better for his ailing wife's health.In 2004, Ruby is an 84-year-old woman who is strong in her faith. Though her two adult children have just taken her keys away, she sets out on a mission to return to Beulah Mountain, where the massacre happened decades ago. Her story takes intriguing twists and turns, which lead to the truth about the mining company in both 1933 and 2004.What I Enjoyed Most about Under a Cloudless SkyThis story deftly weaves the past and present together. It talks about friendship, dedication, and conviction. I was drawn in, chapter by chapter, by the slowly unfolding mystery. It kept me up later than normal last night, but it was definitely worth it.He writes tenderly about Ruby, and I appreciate his insight into an elderly person's challenges.\u00a0The mountain-style metaphors and interesting side story lines gave this book extra interest. I also enjoyed pondering what life was like for these hard-pressed people in American history.This author's note\u00a0wraps up the story nicely:I host a radio program called Chris Fabry Live.\u00a0 I've noticed, through the years, that many callers who are up in years will confide, with the right prompting, some difficult thing that happened years ago that they've never revealed to anyone...As callers reveal themselves, I hear it in their voices. There is something taken from them in the telling, a load they have carried for decades...I often wonder why it took so long to put it there and if someone they know and love will help them move forward.If you're looking for a new fiction read that's clean, historically based, and thought-provoking,\u00a0Under a Cloudless Sky\u00a0is a great choice.Thanks goes out to Tyndale Fiction for a free review copy of this wonderful book."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Dennison", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17846840-elizabeth-dennison", "userReview": "The present and the past meet in this book about a Southern Coal mining town fighting to survive in a time where the big companies rule.

Under a Cloudless Sky has an interesting intermingle of events that happened in 1933 and events of 2004, with character entwined in ways that no one saw coming. I enjoyed getting to know Ruby and Bean, children in 1933--- one the rich daughter of a mine owner, one the poor daughter of a drunk mine worker, but both of whom were kindred spirits and best friends. Each had a father, whom in his own right cared for their daughter and was trying to deal with issues in his own life. I enjoyed getting to know Ruby's children and how time had not changed Ms. Ruby in 2004. I was intrigued in how Chris Fabry was able to entwine 2 different time frames and make them into one seamless story with powerful themes running through--- what is our relationships with our parents? How can we find hope in situations that may seem hopeless? Are we able to forgive if and when it is needed? How do we look upon \"faith\" in the characters and in others? As I read the story and got more engrossed into the relationship of Ruby and Bean and the many things that they went through in their short time to know one another I thought about my own relationships with friends. As I became engrossed into the relationship that Ruby has with her own children, I began to think about the relationship that I have with my children and the relationship that I have with my parents and in-laws as they age. Under a Cloudless Sky is also a plain good story full of mystery, intrigue, suspense and an overwhelming sense of family love. It kept me entertained and that is important to me. Without giving away the ending, I will say that it was a powerful way to wrap up the story and not what I was expecting.

It centers primarily on the friendship between two young girls\u2014Ruby and Bean. Though they come from opposite sides of the tracks the girls become inseparable BFF\u2019s. That is until they get swept up in a power struggle between the forces of greed and power\u2014versus truth, justice, and integrity.The story primarily deals with the far-reaching effects of hideous and dark truths that get buried under a mountain of coal, money, and lies.The present-day community in Beulah Mountain must decide between an easy expediency and continuing to \u201ccover up\u201d what actually took place in \u201cthe massacre of 1933,\u201d or face the wretched truth with all the consequences of its ugliness.Of course, the ancient struggle of forgiving what seems unforgivable presents present day residents with the same challenges their forefathers faced when they come face-to-face with their own fighting, feuding, and class warfare.Present-day Ruby is now an old woman struggling with all the advancing infirmities that her old age brings. Her conscience won\u2019t leave her alone and she is running out of time. She must decide whether she will \u201cfinish well\u201d and be true to her professed Christian ideals, which means dealing honestly with her past, or take what she knows about what really happened all those years ago on Beulah Mountain, and bury her secret in the grave with her.The beginning chapters of the book were challenging for me, as it is almost written like a movie script or screenplay, jumping back and forth between this scene, then that.But should the reader have the same struggle I did, I highly recommend you hang in there and stay with it as the end of the story is well worth the climb, with all it\u2019s troubling twists and turns through those Appalachian hills.It delivers a surprising finale that totally stunned me!I want to thank Tyndale House Publishers for sending me a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review.Chris Fabry's Under A Cloudless SkyUnder A Cloudless Sky is available now at all fine retail booksellers as well as Christian Book Distributors and Amazon online. I gave this book a five star rating on Goodreads. It really is a great story and one I think you\u2019ll enjoy.

Never.I know, crazy, huh? He\u2019s won some big awards in the Christian Fiction business, but I\u2019ve never got around to reading his books. I\u2019m more of a romance girl. After attending a Christian writer\u2019s conference in Nashville and hearing him speak, I knew I needed to give it a try. So I volunteered to read and review Under a Cloudless Sky and was blown away.This story is all about forgiveness, redemption, and grace. It\u2019s about fighting for the truth, for what really matters. It\u2019s about the struggle of everyday life, when circumstances hurt, when family falls apart, when life doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s about turning to God in the hard times and giving life to Him.This novel has been compared to the popular memoir Hillbilly Elegy. Having had the privilege to spend some time in the Appalachian Mountain area, I was attracted to this type of story. It\u2019s noble, beautiful, and compelling, and it shows what a wonderful area it is.The story slowly unwinds, and at first, I had no idea how it all worked together. It didn\u2019t make sense in my brain. It\u2019s split between Ruby\u2019s life modernly, and her past. But as the two develop, it all begins to make sense. I smiled at points and blinked back tears at others, especially at the end. This story is a poignant tale and it resonates with my heart. It has twists that are shocking, but as I thought over the story, it all made sense!Under a Cloudless Sky is a novel that I\u2019ll keep for a long time and one that will leave me thinking for just as long. It\u2019s a must-read, even if you\u2019re like me and rarely deviate from anything that doesn\u2019t involve romance. It\u2019s beauty and grit, loss and restoration, all wrapped up in one.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher. I was not required to write a positive review.

Hollis Beasley is taking his last stand. Neighbors up and down the hollow have sold their land to Coleman Coal and Energy, but Hollis is determined to hold on to his family legacy on Beulah Mountain.

At first it was hard going back and forth from 1933 and 2004. You had to pay attention to what time period you were in. The story of Ruby and Bean was very special and it was quite interesting at how Chris Fabry brought the two time periods together. Chris Fabry is an award-winning author and radio personality.

Cloudless and coal seem to be at opposite ends of the spectrum. An elderly lady living in central Kentucky in 2004 is remembering the brief time she lived in Beulah Mountain, West Virginia, in 1933 with her father, who was the co-owner of the coal mining company and the general store. When she lived there as a young teen, the whole world seemed cloudy. Meanwhile back in Beulah Mountain, the grandson of the other co-owner is trying to buy out everyone living on the mountain so the coal company can expand its operations and use massive machinery to mine the coal. As the story moves back and forth from 1933 to 2004, Ruby is torn between going back for a big celebration the town is planning or staying home in Kentucky. Without knowing anything about the invitation she has received to be the guest of honor, her adult children decide she is too old to continue driving and take her car keys from her. Now, what would you do if your kids took your car keys from you when you felt you were still quite capable of driving? For Ruby, that was upsetting enough but learning that her son had spoken with a neighbor about buying her car was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. She makes a decision that has all kinds of repercussions for her son and daughter, as well as for the folks down in Beulah Mountain. One of those people is Hollis who promised his parents before they died that he would never sell their land. But Buddy Coleman is applying the pressure for him to sell. What does any of that have to do with Ruby? The excitement and tension mounts as one event after the other occurs, pulling the reader along like a runaway train down the mountainside. Will greed win? Jump on the train and see where it takes you. You will enjoy the ride."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31967709-elizabeth", "userReview": "Under a Cloudless Sky is a mesmerizing, gripping read, telling the story of Hollis Beasley and his efforts to preserve his land, and the story of Ruby Freeman, who\u2019s faced with struggles from various angles. It\u2019s also the story of Ruby\u2019s daughter, Frances, and Hollis\u2019s granddaughter, Charlotte, and those stories are intermingled with the 1933 story as we learn about young Ruby and her friend Bean in the days leading up to a significant tragedy.Fabry is a fantastic storyteller, weaving together the various points-of-view and the two different time periods effortlessly. I never felt jarred or bothered by the back-and-forth, and the switching was done effectively, creating just the right amount of tension and curiosity. His characterization is amazing, as well; even the characters that are focused on for only a small amount of time are fleshed out and interesting, with the exception of Buddy Coleman.I did figure out a majority of the plot before it was revealed in the book, but it was such an exciting moment for me when I did figure it out that it can hardly be considered a negative. I could hardly wait for the characters to confirm what I had discovered.The voice of the characters was great; the mechanics and the storytelling itself were gripping and artfully delivered; the entire book was difficult to put down. There were a few things here and there that I thought were amiss (the whole kidnapping bit in the middle of the book was odd and seemed to exist solely to flesh out Frances as a character), but overall, Under a Cloudless Sky was a worthwhile, thrilling read that made me excited for more of Fabry\u2019s works.Disclaimer: I received a free copy from the publisher.

One is the daughter of the mine owner and the other is the daughter of a mine worker. Both girls are looked after by Bean's mother and they do not know about the conflict that is coming.In the present, Hollis Beasley has decided he is going to hold onto the legacy which his family left him on Beulah Mountain. His friend Buddy Coleman, however, want to increase the coal production of the town and open a museum. He wants to share the entire history of this town, including the 1933 uprising.

In fact, for most of her life she wrestled with the dark parts of her story that lead her on a journey toward forgiveness. Chris Fabry\u2019s fiction novel tells Ruby\u2019s story, a story that takes Ruby back to her childhood in a poor coal mining town in West Virginia during the 1930s. Fabry\u2019s novel goes between telling Ruby\u2019s childhood story and details about her later life as an old woman when she harbors a secret that causes her to risk life and limb to make peace with what she\u2019s buried down in her heart.Under a Cloudless Sky offers readers a narrative that isn\u2019t always predictable. Think you\u2019ve got Ruby figured out once you\u2019re a few chapters in? Think again. Fabry\u2019s book has some plot twists readers may not see coming, and it\u2019s a strength of the novel. Ultimately, Under a Cloudless Sky shows that forgiveness, though sometimes costly, can still be found even if it takes years to come. Like it was in Ruby\u2019s story, it\u2019s possible to let go of the weight of the past and move forward with hope into the future. For readers looking for an entertaining story with valuable themes to learn from, Under a Cloudless Sky offers a reading opportunity that allows for both of those goals to be accomplished.*Tyndale House Publishers provided me with a complimentary copy of Under a Cloudless Sky for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3329345-pam", "userReview": "\u201cUnder a Cloudless Sky\u201d is another book by Chris Fabry that takes the reader places she never expected to go. I certainly never expected what seemed to be a simple story about an aging woman fighting for her independence to morph into such a revealing look at life in a small mining town in West Virginia. You would think that after reading several novels by this author I would know better. Chris Fabry always has a surprise or two in store for me in every one of his books.Fabry\u2019s writing never fails to impress me with his skilled plotting and depth of his characters. Although this novel moved between two time frames frequently, I never found it difficult to keep up with the story. With an independent mother close in age to Ruby, there were times I could relate all too well with her children and their fears for her. I have to hope that my own mom never takes it upon herself to do what Ruby did in her story.So many twists and unexpected revelations not only held my attention but also touched my heart.

Together, the two uncover a dark secret involving the coal mine's owner and other executives that leads to a brutal massacre changing not only the town's destiny but also the destinies of Ruby, Bean and their families.

From the start, this book vaguely reminded me of the film \"Promised Land\", which starred Matt Damon. \"Promised Land\" was the story of how a big corporation was trying to convince people to give up their way of life in the name of progress. \"Under a Cloudless Sky\" told a very similar tale...until it took a turn that hooked me even more.The book alternates between 1933 and 2004, telling the story of two girls named Ruby and Bean. Ruby, an elderly woman in 2004, is looking back through the years and confronting some difficult memories. Those memories are veiled in mystery, a mystery that kept me turning pages until I polished off the book in two days.We all want to route for the underdog, and I'm going to guess that we all want to see the everday, \"little man\" win in the face of a big company. We also want to bring exploitation and abuse to light, to see wrongs righted and the innocent given a voice. The story that \"Under a Cloudless Sky\" tells gives the readers all those gifts.
