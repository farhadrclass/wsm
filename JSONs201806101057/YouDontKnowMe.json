On the one hand, I found the story nice. I particularly liked the dynamic between the two brothers, Sean and Jack Stone, the famous golden boys. Their characters were well-described, with all of their flaws explained and justified.On the other hand, the female main character, Rue, the illegitimate Stone sister, was so annoying. She managed to lose herself without a strong enough reason, for me. And the romance between her and the rockstar was gratuitous at best. The story could move forward without it but I understand the necessity of it and the conflict it was supposed to bring. But it didn't, or it was so easily dissolved, so there went whatever that love story had to offer."}, {"userName": "Michelle Quintana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9492426-michelle-quintana", "userReview": "I give this book 2.5 stars but only because I liked Alec, Jack, and Sean. Rue started off ok but then she turned into a naive, dumb person, especially when she drank. She swore up and down that the money wouldn't change her and she didn't really want it, but once she had, she became the very person Jack accused her of being. Maybe if the book had been longer with better character development I might have liked Rue. She got on my nerves so badly at times that I was tempted to just quit reading the book.

It started out okay, but fell flat mighty fast. Rue starts out as a character with a bit of backbone, but quickly seems to become this vapid, moronic cariacture of a character. The scenes that were meant to be erotic were anything but, simply as there was no build up to them. There was no growing lust between the pair before things took off between them, so I didn't feel invested in the pair at all. Let alone the fact that it went from 0-100 every time things switched between a character driven scene to an erotic scene.Then there is the time frame that the entire book was set in. It makes it all the more unbelievable for all that occurs during this time.Not a book I would recommend to others, and I have to be honest and say based on this book alone I can't say I wouldn't be picking up another title by this author.

One brother think sister is full of shit while the other gives her the benfit of the doubt. Everyone probabaly knows by now how much I absolutely love sibling relationships in stories so I was so excited for this. But damn. What a let down. Couldn't connect with any of the characters. Rue and Alec's chemistry didn't work for me at all. It was lust at first sight but I felt absolutely nothing between them. The relationship between Rue and her brothers Sean and Jack was okay but that's as far as it went.

And they're super rich. And now the same is true for her.Dearie...I loved the story per se, being 21, discovering that you have loads of money. Plus, there are those two rich and spoiled boys who discover they have a not-so-rich but pretty down-to-earth sister. Love Jack for being your typical bad boy who doesn't care about anything and lives life to the fullest (at least, that's what he thinks). He's mean at first and really thinks the earth revolves around him. Plus, he thinks he has problems? Dear god, don't get me started on his... First world problems more or less. But okay. Then, there's his brother Sean, a somewhat insecure but super protective brother who has his own secret. And then there's their best friend, Alec - superstar. This guy? He's superbored with is life, likes flirting with girls, hooking up with them and then disposing of them. He thinks it's a good idea to agree to Jack's plan. Breaking their half-sister's heart? Hey, why not, right? Dude...Anyways, I liked the story up to that point. But unfortunately, our heroine is super weak, doesn't have a backbone, can't make up her mind - just like all the others basically. I'm pretty bored at that point.Sure, I like her when she's throwing her tantrums, when she shows us that she can be strong but it's like, she deflates after that and lets others form her. She really never sticks to her plans and thoughts and I don't like that.Also, when Alec has another woman, he totally ignores her. He totally wants to keep her a secret, our heroine is mad but then he kisses Rue and she forgets about everything that happened before. Communication between them? Non-existent.I mean, all this, I want him so badly, so of course, all is well between us, is sooo disappointing...So, yeah, weak heroine...Then I have to add that there's no communication between our MCs which is just awful. I mean, they never discuss their pasts; we don't really get to know the MCs - neither Rue nor Alec. And I mean, isn't that what a relationship should be about??But okay.Then there's the fact that Alec likes Rue's \"childbearing hips\". Wow. What is that even supposed to mean??Oh, yeah, and there's NO SAFE SEX. And at that point I was really considering not finishing this book 'cause I hate that. They don't even discuss whether she's on birth control. Plus, he's been with loads of women before her and doesn't even think about using a freaking condom??? Seriously???Rue really is like a child and is just putty in his hands and that made me super mad.The ending was frustrating as well... I really had the feeling that we didn't know the main characters in the end.So all in all, great beginning, weak ending, weak middle...Oh yeah, btw Alec is a rockstar apparently but we never even hear him sing or play... Or be on stage. So, yeah, that's no rockstar romance there...But hey, it's free so grab a copy and just try it out."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5372197-megan", "userReview": "I'm probably being generous giving this a 2 star rating, because the story requires a lot to be believable, but I did like some of the story.

Both men are in the spotlight, notorious for their social upstanding, fame and scandals, however upon the eve of Rue's 21st birthday, it is revealed their father has left behind a gargantuan $50 million for his illegitimate daughter. The daughter who was never meant to exist and has merely recognised these people her whole life for their celebrity status quo.Jack, especially antagonistic and bitter despises Rue and her deceased mother. Meeting her, he is cruel yet can't stop the perusal of her aesthetics. Despite his asshole antics, the chemistry between the two hovers somewhere between the thin line of hate-angst-f*ck-love. The writing definitely implied a forbidden attraction of some sort and somehow I hoped it would turn deeper. She says that 'he pushes her buttons' and 'over the edge.' I was weirdly into it.But suddenly, my dreams went down the drain pipe as Rue meets Alec, Jack and Sean's close friend - rocker, lead singer and manwhore. Jack makes a deal with Alec that he break Rue's heart. And suddenly I lost interest, because she gets wet, Alec gets rock hard, and their instant attraction/ insta-love leads to an angst ridden back and forth will-they-won't-they trope. She became especially pathetic, not that she was ever strong. A mere few hours and she says like some sort of obsessed groupie:\"That if I'm going to get my heart broken. I want it to be by him.\"I thought her emotions were erratic. One minute she's kissing Alec, the next she's sad, the next she's euphoric and drunk making out with a man who looks like Hercules. And her and Jack are just brother and sister *eyeroll* but he's peeking at her topless as she makes out with Alec and holds some kind of sibling rivalry against her. Seriously, usually I'm not on the brother-sister train, but it would have been better in this case. Their relationship instead was suspiciously safe but there was some sort of weird attraction. Then Alec strings her about. Despite the attractive title of the book, I bowed out."}, {"userName": "Mary Spellman", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30736145-mary-spellman", "userReview": "2 PlatypiresGreat Scott @ Platypire ReviewsIt could have been great. I tried to like this book, I really did. I can't go too in depth because I hate reviews with spoilers but I would like to say that to me, this is NOT a love story. Lust is not love, and I'm genuinely confused as to why the author tried to pass it off as such. Also there were four POVs in the story, which is honestly two too many. I felt as though some of the POVs weren't necessary. I see why the author did it, but it could have worked just as well of it was written in 3rd/ past tense versus 1st/ present tense. If there were more stories in the series, I would more than likely try to read another just because I do think there is potential there for the characters.

At a meeting at their lawyer's office she learns she has inherited $50 million. It is revealed the late Maxwell Stone was her father. She has also gained two brothers and the recognition that follows them. For three years, Rue has been alone after losing her mother to cancer. Her best friend Jenna is the only family she has had. Within a few minutes she had gained and lost a father. However the most precious gift Max has given her, are the love letters from him and her mother. These allow her to reconnect with her mum. Rue initially refuses the money but a clause in Max's will prevents her from doing so. Overnight Rue Calliwell has become a millionaire. Thrown into the spotlight, everything she says or does is scrutinised by the media. As she endeavours to fit into her brother's world, she tries to do so without losing her identity and who she is. Sean is pleased to learn he has a half sister and feels an instant protectiveness towards her but his brother Jack, feels betrayed by their father. He refuses to believe anyone would turn down 50 million dollars. He doesn't believe the charade he feels Rue is portraying and becomes determined to prove to everyone that she is a fraud. Jack enlists the help of their best friend Alec Gabriel to gain Rue's trust and then break her heart. But as time goes by, he realises his actions have consequences. Alec Gabriel has left a trail of broken hearts. He agrees to help Jack and looks forward to meeting the half sister but upon meeting Rue, he feels an instant connection to her both physically and emotionally. He realises Rue is not like the others and as they begin their affair, he knows he will protect Rue at all costs. I found this story an emotional journey and cried in parts. Faleena Hopkins has managed to capture the beauty of love not only between Rue and Alec but also the familial love between siblings. It was a heartfelt story.

It was a quick read\u2026 I\u2019ve only read Ms Hopkins Paranormal books, so this book was surprisingly chance of pass for me with herRue who learns that she's the half-sister to a pair of notorious billionaire playboys, Jack & Sean Stone. Is told in 4 POV\u2019s.. I don\u2019t rember read the time I read about with so many POV\u2019.. It was very interesting to say to the least to have that Luckily Rue wakes up the day after her 21st birthday to knock on her door. Only to the famous Stone standing there & all they said was \"You'll be hearing from my lawyer,\" Jack Stone is your typical spoil rich boy\u2026Rude & obnoxious to anyone who he believes is below him.. So you can just imagine how he treated Rue. Jack does not hide is distaste for Rue at all. He is very cruel & is constantly mean and degrading her.Sean Stone is so damn adorable sweet to Rue from the being. Sean has his secrets just like his father, unwilling to share cuz the media would have a field day if his secrets get outAlec Gabriel is the womanizing front man for the band Locked Tight. He's also the best friend of the famous Stone brothers, Jack and Sean.. I wasn\u2019t to happen when vengeful Jack asks Alec to make Rue his new play thing\u2026 Also I imagine it would be sad story, but one I wouldn\u2019t mind reading is the story how all this started??? Maxwell & Connie storyI am hoping in the future that Ms Hopkins can give us more Jack & Sean Stone, & even more about Alec & Rue\u2026. The family aspect of this book was amazing\u2026I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to cry my ass off or laugh to dead in some parts..
