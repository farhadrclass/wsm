The Organites in particular are pretty cool (if borrowing somewhat from Star Trek), as they are tiny life-giving creatures that can heal scars and mend bones. Many of the other steampunk elements are also fun, including the decorative but useful steel corset designed for Finley by her friend Emily.But after awhile, there's almost too much technology on show, particularly when random devices make appearances for no apparent reason. There is an instant camera, rebuilding of hearts, and numerous other scientific discoveries that just aren't very convincing. Further straining credibility is the notion that Emily, a teenaged girl, would be so proficient in medicine, surgery, and the use of aforementioned technology, despite any back story to indicate her training or education. There's also a disturbing lack of adult presence in this book, and the few that make appearances seem merely there for show. On top of this, the plot itself is pretty thin, there's very little character development, and the attempts to mimic the language of the time is awkward at best.This book starts out with a bang as Finley flees the household where she's been mistreated and then encounters the self-same lord in a dark alley. Unfortunately, it quickly loses momentum as it becomes apparent that this is essentially a romance novel with a gorgeous cover and some great action scenes. The steampunk genre certainly invites a certain suspension of disbelief, but Victorian England--and its manners and mores--should be more than just a set decoration for a story that is placed in that era. Readers who crave fun, well-written steampunk would do better to find Cassandra Clare's Clockwork Angel, which skillfully blends mystery, magic, and strong characters and plot in with the distinct language and customs of the day.This review also appears in The Midnight Garden; a review copy was provided by the publisher."}, {"userName": "Jessie  (Ageless Pages Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863162-jessie-ageless-pages-reviews", "userReview": "[Also - how does she have such an ability without exposure to the Organites?

Her talent seems to rest in creating an interesting world and atmosphere where those kinds of elements can come together. The problem, though, is that a great number of other things seemed to fall by the wayside in order to craft such a world, including a clear narrative, character investment, and a large amount of tension within the story arc.Steampunk and packed with adventure, The Girl in the Steel Corset opens upon a young serving maid named Finley Jayne who believes she's struggling with a darker side within, a side that unleashes when she's frightened or angry. Incidentally, we're treated to a display of this when the master's son decides he'd like to take advantage of the new serving girl, and he winds up beaten unconscious. As Finley is aware that she'll be lucky if she only winds up dismissed from her position and not arrested, the voice in her head offers some solid advice -- flee before either can happen. Dashing into the street as she escapes, Finley is nearly run down -- conveniently, by the only young man in all of London who can truly help her. Within his circle of friends, she finds even more frightening prospects than dealing with her own internal struggles -- the possibility of understanding, a useful place, and true friends.The Girl in the Steel Corset gets major points based on cover and book design alone -- I loved the dips and curls of the script combined with the cogs on chapter pages and the lush cover is quite vibrant. My experience with steampunk literature is rather limited (aka Gordon Dahlquist and Gail Carriger), so perhaps staunch supporters of the genre would be able to really enjoy the detail that Cross goes in to. The world that Cross paints has the benefit of luxury (as one of the main characters and leader of the group, Griffin King, is a wealthy young Duke) being contrasted with the gritty world outside. There are still all kinds of crazy mechanical contraptions (including a whole lot of robots) and fashions that work in a good deal of body piercings. Introducing a unique element (or at least making it something *I* haven't yet seen before), Cross features a new form of ore that seems to function as a blended mechanical/organic composite -- and keeping this substance away from those who would use its powers for evil will obviously occupy a lot of time in the series... well, that and trying to figure out just how it works and how it has affected those who come in contact with it. Oh, and there's also this thing called the aether, which seems to encompass all living livings -- and dead ones, as it seems spirits exist in the aether. Are you smirking yet? I'll admit, I smirked quite often, and yet I think steampunk enthusiasts are willing to accept a lot of crazy things for the sake of fun, even if this seemed more sci-fi at times.I would try to explain the plotline in greater detail, but truth be told, I still haven't managed to shake the feeling that I was tossed into a series midway through, and so I find it hard to summarize in anything vaguely resembling a linear trajectory. Even when you know the book says \"Steampunk Chronicles #1,\" I still felt the compulsive need to do some internet research and see if there weren't, perhaps, other series somehow linked to this one... and even when I came up with nothing under this same author name, I still remain somewhat unconvinced that there isn't a manuscript floating around out there with earlier story installments for these characters. Without proof of that, though, my only explanation is that Cross seeks to put the reader on par with Finley, who is entering a group of friends rather late in the game, as they have a whole history of collaboration to their credit. There are, however, much better ways to suggest this than leaving your reader with the near-constant distracting feeling that she's missing something. It's downright frustrating to have lots of complications right at the start and a large cast of characters that obviously have convoluted emotions towards each other. The romantic tangles seemed to be more fitting for a second or third series installment, as triangles seemed already in place, and the characters themselves were never developed enough to the point where I felt like I sincerely cared for them. The story seemed to expect I would care about the good guys simply because I was told to (though some effort is put in to painting a \"bad guy\" as still being interesting and alluring). Finley herself is rather lacking in personality -- which almost seems hard to imagine, given that she's supposed to have two distinctly different sides, so you'd think at least one would jump out at you. Two strong male characters are drawn to her and yet I see no reason for them to feel this pull. And the villain? Well, I kept picturing \"The Machinist\" as Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget and that's just not a good sign. His motivations (once we get to know them) seem flimsy and evil-villainy where one might otherwise hope for some nuance or at least solid reasoning. In the end, I was rather disappointed in The Girl in the Steel Corset as a trailblazer for YA steampunk. (The only thing that seemed to make it YA appeared to be the ages of the main characters and the PG romance. There are romantic storylines in play, but nothing that ever takes us beyond an impassioned kiss.) Even the title ultimately proved misleading, as the steel corset really isn't an integral element to the story, beyond its not-so-subtle fusion of the time period's costume with industrial steel-work. Hopefully Cross will be able to hit her stride with later books and develop her writing abilities, but I'm rather doubtful that I'll pick up future installments in this series.Please note that I received an advanced review copy of this novel courtesy of NetGalley for the purpose of review."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1310688-kristi", "userReview": "Steampunk-ery at it's best. This is one steam-tastic debut! Steam-erific.... okay I'm done.This is my second \"steampunk\" novel and although it was quite a bit different than the other novel I read, I am finding myself enamored with this genre! Finley. Wow, that girl can kick some butt. I think that I was immediately drawn to her because of that power she had. Seriously, I would love to be able to kick someone's ass like that! Well, when the occasion called for it.... being controlled by a darker side, is something that I don't really have an interest in at all.The characters and the world are what I enjoyed the most. I loved their quirks and the haphazard family that they created for each other, it was all rather endearing. And I loved the darkness and mystery surrounding the one and only Jack Dandy... now there is a character I want to see a little more of. I'd say he has a few secrets hidden up his sleeves. I'll admit that I had the bad guy pegged and his evil plan all figured out, long before the intelligent characters in this novel did! But it was still fun watching them putting all the pieces together themselves. There were a few instances where I was caught by surprise too!Cross has definitely created a world and characters that I can't wait to visit again!"}, {"userName": "Alexis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1157860-alexis", "userReview": "My copy of The Girl in the Steel Corset includes the prequel short The Strange Case of Finley Jayne, which I read first.The Strange Case of Finley Jayne introduces us to the title character, a sixteen-year-old girl from a working class family in Victorian steampunk London. Finley can do things she shouldn't be able to do, like throw a man across a room and leap from a second story window. When she gets riled up, a darkness rises up inside her and makes her stronger than she should be and more aggressive than she wants to be. This other side gets her into trouble, but it catches the attention of a woman whose daughter is engaged to marry a totally creepy noble, who also happens to be a famous inventor. She hires Finley to pose as her niece, and Finley solves the mystery and saves her friend from a terrible fate, all in record time. The short is about 100 pages, but it's fun and light, with lots of action.The short leads right into the events of The Girl in the Steel Corset, but what transpired in the first 100 pages is never mentioned again. In fact, Finley goes on to say multiple times that she has never done some of the things she did in the short. They're minor things - wearing a fancy dress to a ball, dancing with aristocrats, having a friend - but the contradictions pulled me out of the story. Regardless, once the actual story starts, the reader is immediately drawn into the action and conflict. Finley ends up joining the League of Extraordinary Teen X-Men (no, it's not really called that), funded and headed by cutiepie Griffin King, the Duke of Greythorne. I particularly liked his POV scenes, but we get the viewpoint of many of the other characters, too. It's an interesting enough group; if Griffin is the leader, his buddy Sam is the brawn and genius inventor Emily is the brain. Cordelia (Griffin's young widowed aunt) and Jasper (an American cowboy) provide support, and with Finley's addition, they gain the help of the dapper cockney crime lord Jack Dandy. They all combine their wide range of powers to fight The Machinist, an anarchist responsible for a number of crimes involving automatons. I enjoyed the book. Yes, I had issues with some things (like the aforementioned contradictions and Sam being a total bonehead for most of the story), but overall I had fun reading it. It's funny, exciting, and entertaining. I don't read a lot of steampunk, so I was really drawn into the technology of the world Cross created. I gave it 4 stars because I'll definitely read the next one."}, {"userName": "Patr\u00edcia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149100-patr-cia", "userReview": "RATING: 2.5 stars.The Girl in the Steel Corset. You look at the title and it makes you interested; if you're easily swayed by a cover (like I am) you'll be impressed with the beautiful red dress and the hint of the aforementioned steel corset. Then you read the synopsis... and you think \"well, this definitely sounds good\". I know that is what I thought. The neat packaging, the steampunk world and the fact that our main character is a strong female in Victorian times, a character that has a \"Jekyll and Hyde\" feel to her... all of it sounds intriguing.Unfortunately the actual book isn't as good as it promises. The best word to describe it is... \"average\". Maybe even \"dull\". Or if you want to enter the realm of comparison, then it's \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\". No, really.Cardboard story, cardboard characters and cardboard world. Cardboard defines The Girl in the Steel Corset. The story is boring, reads like a badly written sci-fi/steampunk movie and/or like an (even worse) YA version of... \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\". Everything correlates: The group of heroes with the special powers; the mysterious, technically savyy villain, the service to \"Her Majesty, Queen Victoria\"... everything. The plot was just so thin and predictable I was surprised the characters took so long to figure out the evil guy's plans. I mean I kind of knew from almost the beginning.The characters aren't much better. The author managed to make them perfect YA stereotypes, even though this novel takes place in the 19th century. There's even twice the unrealistic love stories and twice the love triangles!!! As for Finley Jayne, the female protagonist, I'm not sure how Cross accomplished the feat of making her the most boring, dull and characterless girl to grace a YA book since Bella Swan. Even Finley's \"dark side\" is annoyingly... dull.And don't even get me started on Griffin King! I mean, first of all he has the most ridiculous name! Griffin King? My mind zeroed on Spider Man and the Kingpin every time I read his name. Worst. Name. Ever. Really. And it's probably the most improbable (lol) name for a member of the 19th century British aristocracy too. Of course he is also a cliche.Last but not least: the world. Steampunk is supposed to be interesting. Except it seemed like the author had a \"list of things that exist in a Steampunk world\" and ticked it off one by one as she was writing the book. So it's basically generic Steampunk, if that even exists. I didn't feel like there was any trace of originality in the world-building; it didn't feel like the author made an effort to develop her own ideas. It was just... automatons and steam powered machines.So, overall, The Girl in the Steel Corset (and I'm wondering why it's even called that, the steel corset is, at best, a very minor character) was a pretty 'bland' read. The book didn't display any originality in terms of story, characters or world. I guess it was written in an interesting manner, but I thought the author could have done a lot more with it if only Finley had been more interesting or if the focus of the plot had been different or even if Cross decided not to include the \"love story\" (if unrealistic, insta-romance can be considered that). I was disappointed with this book, I expected more action and a more lively heroine."}, {"userName": "tonya.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4358824-tonya", "userReview": "Sigh. I really wanted to love this one. I'm a sucker for pretty covers, the author was sweet as pie when I met her and the excerpt she read from the beginning of the book was great. Unfortunately, I only just barely liked it, and if it hadn't been for the fact that I'd received an advance copy of it, I probably wouldn't have finished it. Things I liked about it:Finley Jayne has the potential to be a great character. I was on board with the whole Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy and the battle for good and evil going on inside of her. I like it when the main character is a girl who can kick ass and doesn't need anyone to coddle her. She's an exciting and engaging character and as the series progresses I hope Cross can clean up the plot a bit to let her main character shine.The organites and semi-sentient machines aspect was cool. I haven't read a lot of steampunk, but I liked the historical bent on science fiction.Things that nearly ruined it for me:It was LOOOOONG. Nearly 500 pages--and it felt that way. The plot was incredibly slow moving. For all the action in the first few pages, 3/4ths of the book moved at a snail's pace with repetition after repetition, and only the smallest revelations marking forward progress. As I said, I haven't read much in the steampunk genre, but the fact that they had nearly every modern convenience felt like overkill. I understand this is science fiction, but other than the way the characters talked and dressed, I might not have known it was set in the Victorian age with all the talk of showers and electricity and vehicles--albeit powered in different fashions than we have today. I found myself wondering why Cross bothered to write it in a historical setting at all if she was just going to modernize nearly every aspect. But again, this could just be my unfamiliarity with the genre.Neither of the love interests did anything for me, and I couldn't figure out why they did anything for Finley either. There was very little chemistry between any of them.The cheesy romance novel-y writing style. I can't really put my finger on what it is about the writing, only that I knew right away the author had written historical romances before. All that being said, I did see potential in Finley and was interested in the plot line itself--once she got around to it. I won't completely throw out the possibility of reading the next in the series, but I hope it's pared down with tighter pacing and a more controlled storyline."}, {"userName": "Isamlq", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4016030-isamlq", "userReview": "I could list out all the things that just annoyed me. I could say its abrupt. With one thing after another and no breather in between it just become a series of unfortunate events. I could say the tech aspect was a bit too much. I could even say all that describing was too much. But I will go with this: I do not like characters that lack depth which is not really the problem here. Rather it's the complete opposite. I can tell you precisely what Finley, Griff, Sam and Emily all look like; I can tell you what they do and why they do what they do. AND YET: I honestly did/do not care. When a book tells me loads of stuff, IMO I start not to care. All that description took me away from the story. All I\u2019m saying is let me figure things out myself, with that I will probably never finish this book. And here\u2019s one more really annoying point~ Finley. At one point she\u2019s swooning at the probable ability of the men she encounters to overpower her\u2026 I mean seriously WTF?!?

We follow a group of characters who are all a little special in some ways, they all have different specific abilities, as they try to stop the evil plot of a man named The Machinist. I swear, it may sound cheesy but it\u2019s actually a lot cooler than it sounds. The pace is quite slow which bothered me a bit but the plot is really complex and has a lot of moving parts. It reminded me a bit of A Tale of Two Cities where you have various points of views for all the different aspects of the plot and you know a lot more than the characters do. There\u2019s a lot of characters which means a lot of different perspectives which means that you have a lot of different views on everything that\u2019s going on in the story as well as in the relationships between the characters. The down side is that you can see a lot of the twists/surprises from a mile away because if you\u2019re smart and you have all the information (which most characters don\u2019t) you can totally figure out what is going to happen so the plot became predictable quite easily. I don\u2019t feel like it took away from my reading experience because I was still interested to see how things would play out at the end.Finley is arguably the focus and main character of the story and she suffers from what I like to call Jekyll/Hyde syndrome. She literally has a dual personality. The explanations are kind of a spoiler so I\u2019m going too deep into it but this kind of personality was really interesting to me. The push and pull of both the light and dark side of her and the ramifications it had on her emotionally, mentally and physically were very intriguing. I wish the other would have spent more time with her in that state because it would\u2019ve made the story more dynamic but in the end it wasn\u2019t explored as much as I would\u2019ve liked and the solution was too simple for me. Part of the reason why I felt this book could\u2019ve had a great love triangle is because of this peculiarity of her personality. It\u2019s the only time when I think love triangles are acceptable, when the main character has two parts of herself that desire different things in a partner. It could\u2019ve been so interesting if that had been explored no, but the romance wasn\u2019t the main focus of the plot either way.There\u2019s an entire cast of characters in this book and these are all special and unique in their own way. Griffin is kind of the leader in a way, he\u2019s very powerful and has a very focused goal in mind. He\u2019s had a dramatic path and he\u2019s very determined to do his part in the world and for his family. Sam, Griffin\u2019s best friend, is a giant mess. He\u2019s very broody and dark and has kind of anger issues because of a lot of crappy things that happened to him. He\u2019s kind of a dufus sometimes and he really frustrated me. He kind of made a lot of bad decisions that screwed a lot of things up for everyone. Emily, who rounds out the main trio of side characters, is a Irish girl with a flare for the intellectual. She\u2019s super kick ass but with her mind, she is funny and sweet but also stands up for herself and those she cares about. I really enjoyed her character and personality and I hear she\u2019s a narrator in one of the other books in the series which makes me super excited. Then there\u2019s Jasper who kind of comes in a little later and he\u2019s an American cowboy (not joking whatsoever). He was really funny and sarcastic but we didn\u2019t get to know him as much until the very last scene when you end up thinking \u201cwhu?\u201d And last but not least, Jack Dandy is sort of kind of the villain in this motley crew. He\u2019s not the one that the synopsis speaks up but he\u2019s the antagonist to Griffin. I spoke about their differences above but that was only what we find out about Jack on the surface. I feel like there is so much more to him and it wasn\u2019t explored in this first book. I would love to see more of him and hear more of his back story.Overall, I like the majority of this book. The characters were interesting and the story kept my attention but the pace was really slow and I feel like a lot of things were underdeveloped. Still it was a good start to a series and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing it.

I thought it mixed together the elements of steampunk and the Victorian Age very well. I loved the characters, and I loved how Cross added in Gothic elements as well by using inspiration from some stories we all know and love (Frankenstein--well I hated that; Jekyll and Hyde--ditto) and threw some twists in.\"The Girl in the Steel Corset\" included a nice little backstory to the character of Finley Jayne. From there it goes into the longer story that has Finley meeting other characters I assume we are to follow for the rest of this series. Finley's backstory gave us enough of a glimpse to know there is something about her. You don't know what. But at times she feels like she is two people trapped in one body. The short story that began before it included the longer story was so good. I loved it and wish we had followed up with characters introduced in that. When we catch up with Finley again, she ends up fighting off a young lord of the manor who thinks he can take her and do what he wills. When she flees after injuring him, she runs into Griffin King and his friends who are doing what they can to defend the country (England) against outside enemies.Besides Finley and Griffin, we also have Emily, Sam, Jasper, and a young man called Jack Dandy. We quickly find out that Griffin and his friends (Emily, Sam, and Jasper) are out to capture a man/woman called The Machinist who is behind several crimes that took place involving automatons. However, suspicions turns towards Finley for maybe being involved with the Machinist when things start happening that shows that the criminal is out to get them. Even though this is a Young Adult book (and yeah I had no idea when I borrowed it from the library) this book reads much older. I didn't even realize the characters are teenagers until I saw someone's age mentioned. That's not a knock against Cross either, it was delightful to read young adults who actually for the most part had sense and thank goodness two love triangles reared their heads, but one was absolutely resolved and I think the other one is too for what it's worth. The only complaint I will say that I really did have is that this book was a bit too long. I know that Cross had to set up the other characters and do world building though so it's to be expected in the first book in a series. I just honestly didn't need the story to be swinging back to much to Sam. He got tiresome after a while. I do wish we had spent more time with Griffin's aunt on her adventures though.The setting of a Victorian age with steampunk (think automatons walking around, things people cannot see that are little machines that can repair, people having eyes replaced, etc.) really hit the sweet spot for me.The ending leaves things in the air for some people. I am definitely going to continue this series to see where it goes."}, {"userName": "Ceilidh", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3229028-ceilidh", "userReview": "There\u2019s been much talk amongst the blogosphere of a possible upcoming Steampunk craze in YA, in the wake of Cassandra Clare\u2019s best-selling but incredibly mediocre foray into the genre. Kady Cross, the pseudonym for author Kathryn Smith, mentions in the acknowledgements for her book that she wanted to write a cross between \u201cX Men\u201d and \u201cThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\u201d As a fan of both (I have a serious guilty pleasure love of the latter movie adaptation, even though I\u2019m perfectly aware of how bad it is) I approached this with cautious optimism but, after a great opening chapter, found myself quickly bored. The potential for greatness is definitely there but these promising elements are put together so clumsily and in such a derivative fashion. The love is always in the details, and such things are genre expectations for Steampunk \u2013 it\u2019s not just about shoving in some cogs and corsets and calling it a Steampunk novel, you have to create the entire world in all its depth and intricacies. Unfortunately, this novel tries to throw in so much detail that basic elements of storytelling such as plotting and pacing suffer. There\u2019s just so much stuff to be described and Cross does so frequently and it weighs down the pacing until its dead in the water. There\u2019s so much technology on show, so many paragraphs on the intricacies of a piece of equipment that it quickly becomes exhausting, especially when the story seems to have disappeared. It\u2019s such a shame because the story starts with an intriguing bang that promises much but doesn\u2019t quite deliver. The world never really feels like a well constructed alternative Steampunk universe. Instead, it\u2019s more like a Victorian set romantic mystery with some stuff thrown in. I did find a lot of the technology interesting but its place in the story felt forced and shoe-horned in, never organic to the proceedings. Like the story itself, much of this technology is told to us and not shown. It\u2019s also a disappointment to see how many of the YA paranormal tropes this book falls into. The love triangle, for unfortunately there is another one in a YA novel, is the typical series of events we\u2019ve come to expect in this genre, with little development of the actual characters Finley is supposed to be so taken by. Finley herself was another example of squandered potential. Her genuinely interesting issues were plodded out in such a pedestrian manner that, like everything else in the story, I quickly became bored by her. The mystery that has much more interesting potential than the love triangle is sacrificed for the romance, although what little mystery we were given was a little too predictable. I couldn\u2019t help but shake the feeling that this story wasn\u2019t complete. I know it\u2019s the first in a planned trilogy but on its own, \u201cThe Girl in the Steel Corset\u201d felt half-done. I later found out that Cross had released an online prequel to the book which leaves me with mixed feelings I may have to address in a later blog post.\u201cThe Girl in the Steel Corset\u201d is another example of great potential sadly squandered, and not the Steampunk YA saviour one was hoping for. There are moments of excitement and interest amidst the plodding story and tedious pacing but it never really amounts to something worthwhile. The basic idea of the story is definitely one with possibilities, so I hope Cross can expand upon them and iron out the story\u2019s weaknesses in the rest of the trilogy. 2/5."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "[to replace the Queen of England with an automaton (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Nastassja", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7734134-nastassja", "userReview": "Another wonderful buddy read session with my pen friends.

The world building and language were good and I did not have problems with understanding what goes where. Characters are the strongest plus of this book. They were all nice and each one had a story to tell. I only had issues with the abundance of strange technology, maybe less of this machines would make book a better read for me. Also, the pace of the book felt a little bit rushed at times. I can see some plot holes in there, but I know that the second book will be way better and it is enough for me to know that.I can't say that I was impressed by this book nor was it original.

I\u2019m also always writing at any given time, and I don\u2019t want my prose and choices influenced by shoddy material. So, when I pick books, I pick books I think I will enjoy. I ignore the hype (one reason why I\u2019m scared to read Angelfall) and just plunge in, hoping for the best. The Girl in the Steel Corset was a book I knew nothing about but I found at the library and thought, hey let\u2019s try it. It would be my first venture into steampunk too and the blub on the inside jacket sounded interesting enough.In theory, the book is functional. The quality is not shoddy. Everything the blurb promised was more or less represented the book. The writing is good \u2013 I mean, acceptable. Nothing wooed me but the actual construction of it was inoffensive. Cross is a good writer and I wouldn't mind reading something else of hers. It just took FOR DAMN EVER to get to the bloody point. I have never in my life taken so long to read something, and I have never been so uninterested in the characters. Now, halfway through my struggles I decided to snap up the novella, The Strange Case of Finley Jane, hoping it would make me more eager to continue reading the Steel Corset. It did, too! I liked the short, saucy novella and had a much better appreciation of Finley. But as I got back into the novel, my desire stagnated. Why the hell is this book so damn long? Why does it lack the charm of the shorter story?Length is totally subjective, I know this. I\u2019ve read my fair share of epic books that I read in a hurry because I cared about the characters, and the writing still had enough zip and pacing to bring me along.The Girl in the Steel Corset lacks all of those things. I didn\u2019t care about any of the characters (except for Jack Dandy and he was entirely underused), there were WAY too many descriptions of \u201cflakey croissants that melted on her tongue\u201d and \u201cred, ripe strawberries\u201d and ONE MILLION VATS OF COFFEE, DESCRIBED IN EVERY DETAIL. There were also a lot of descriptions of clothes, which I can appreciate the first time. But is it worth mentioning more or less the same outfit over and over and over again?I swear I read, \u201cFinley slipped on striped stockings, attached them to her red garter belt, put on her heeled, buckled boots, a short skirt and a corset over her blouse\u201d at least a dozen times. And to that matter, if THAT is what \u201cnormal\u201d folk wear everyday, WHAT THE HELL DO THE PROSTITUTES WEAR??!So, having to muddle through this description, you think the book would take an exciting turn eventually. Uh, no. I think halfway through the book the antagonist is introduced. And a protagonist mentioned on the jacket blurb (I\u2019m sorry, but I thought the cowboy would be in the whole book). And now you have more characters and a tiny bit of a plot going on, but you\u2019re just so angry that you\u2019re wasting your time, reading about people you don\u2019t care about.And the last thread of respect I had for aggro Finley was when ripped away when she gets beat up \u2013 on purpose \u2013 by one of the main characters, Sam \u2013 and her \u201clove interest\u201d, the boring Griffin, only seems mildly concerned. And when she fights back and nearly kills Sam, she\u2019s suddenly all \u201cOh I feel so bad. Oh my Grifffin will never forgive me.\u201d Shut the fuck up, girl. I wish she had killed Sam, his character is supposed to be tortured and misunderstood (I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what Cross was going for) but I find him overly emo and intolerable and I keep picturing a giant, hulk-sized Prince Harry with a scowly face. Sure, he attempts to become likeable at the end, but too little, too late.Anyway, this review is way more scathing than I thought it would be. I know lots of people love this book, but if I can\u2019t connect to any of the characters, if I can\u2019t feel an ounce of love or passion in a story, and feel like the whole novel is overrun by trends and gimmicky genre pieces, then I just\u2026NO.I give this book 2.5 stars. Unless the sequel - The Girl in the Clockwork Collar - starts getting rave (and I mean RAVE) reviews, I highly doubt I\u2019ll be reading it, even if I do get that copy from the library. If getting through this book was such a chore, I don\u2019t see how the next one would be any different. It would just be the same characters in a different setting and zzzzzzzzzzzz.It\u2019s not a bad or terrible book by any means and I mean no offense to Cross or to her fans or to the people who like it because, HEY, reviews are subjective. It just, quite obviously, did not work for me."}, {"userName": "usagi \u2606\u30df", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1101220-usagi", "userReview": "This is a gorgeous, wonderful book. I just have to say that right up front. It has all that I look for in this genre (alternate history/steampunk) \u2013 mad scientists, detectives, general paranormal activity, feisty females, and a little (but not too much) romance. Oh, and did I mention it also features a primitive version of Skynet?When you throw all of the above mentioned features together and put it into an accessible YA package, you have my heart for life. This is a great adventure and relief to read \u2013 I was afraid that it might be too stereotypically chick-lit in terms of the romance area (considering the publisher being Harlequin and all), but Cross writes it in so subtly that you\u2019re halfway in before you figure out what\u2019s going on between Finley and Griff. And that itself is a breath of fresh air when you consider anything with romance in the realm of YA, especially as of late.All of these elements are hard to get right by themselves, much less when you throw them together and make a delicious soup like this one. And then there\u2019s the mystery element \u2013 who is the machinist? What are his objectives? Cross subtly builds up the tension between the romance and the appearances of Jack Dandy (Jack the Ripper), along with trying to keep Finley\u2019s head (and soul) together yet balances all of these things with the talent of someone from Cirque du Soleil. And the primitive version of Skynet robots killing (or horribly maiming) people! I enjoyed all aspects of this book, and can find no faults at all with it. And coming from me? I guess that\u2019s high praise, seeing how picky I am and all.Aside from the novella that\u2019s just been released, I really hope that this isn\u2019t the last full-length book set in Cross\u2019 finely constructed \u2018verse. I\u2019ll be reviewing the novella as well, but I\u2019ll still be waiting for news on a second book.

The problem is, it's getting stronger and her situations keep leading her toward people that deserve to see her other side. After a particularly bad experience followed by almost being killed, she finds herself with strangers who may just hold the answer to what's wrong with her. The more she learns about them, the clearer it becomes that not only do they hold the answers, but they also hold secrets about her past that she never thought was possible.My Thoughts: The POV switches between Finley, a servant girl; Griffin King, the Duke of Graythorne; and Sam, a human-robot hybrid. Each is on their own journey to discover what makes them the way they are and the truth to their past. The Girl With The Steel Corset one of those books that grabs your attention from the first sentence. Straight up we're given a strange situation that makes you question whether the heroine is someone who deserves our sympathy or not. As it becomes clear that Finley really doesn't mean or understand her actions, we're taken into her world to discover who exactly she is. As she is basically split into two people, each side of her attracts a different man, each with attractive qualities and secrets. And if you're like me and Finley, it's a hard decision who to choose.Final Opinion: It didn't take me long to decide I loved The Girl in the Steel Corset. The setting was equal parts mysterious and interesting as were the characters. One particular character, Jack Dandy, really grabbed my attention and I believe there'll be more of him in the future. The only thing that let TGITSC down was that is was clear what the villain, The Machinist, was up to and who he was. Other than that, I never wanted to close this book for any reason at all. I loved seeing the personal growth that each character went through from their own POV. It was also clear who was telling the story at each time, something authors can fail spectacularly at. Kady is very talented. If you are so inclined to read dystopian romance, make sure you add TGITSC to your list.Favourite Quote: \"Don't mistake me, Treasure. I can offer you many things, but friendship ain't one of them. Now, for once in your life, be a sensible girl and run away.\" (Jack to Finley, Chapter Five) Cover: It strikes me more of an adult cover than young adult. I love it all the same though mostly because of the small details like the steel on the back of her dress, her jewellery and the clockwork on the wall that give it a real steampunk feel.The Steampunk Chronicles 1.

But despite an awesome first couple of pages, my interest in this book declined faster than the IQ of anyone who loved Twilight, or something even worse like the House of Night series. The start reeled me in with unexpected force but then, somewhere between the totally pointless and forced love triangle, the flat characters with stereotyped personalities, the constant repetition of descriptions (I think I got perfectly clear the first twenty times that Emily's hair is \"ropey\", that Sam was \"huge\" and that Finley's hair color is \"like honey\", among other things, thank you very much) and the technology overload just to get the point across that this is a steampunk novel, the book completely lost me. And I won't even go into how much telling-instead-of-showing the author did or how much it completely annoyed me that our \"heroine\" only felt attracted to men who could overpower her - that alone knocked off two stars from its rating. I still don't think this is a terrible book, its just kind of bleh. There's room for improvement and I'll probably pick up the next one when I find it cheap. Someday I'll make a more thorough review.

First of all, it started out pretty boring. After reading the first few chapters it took me like three weeks to pick it up again. I didn\u2019t want to give up on it, and it did get better as I read it, but still. Also, I wasn\u2019t invested in a single character; they all felt flat to me.

Sure, the plot was an interesting idea and the characters were set to charm you, but that did not happen in my case.The characters were nothing new in this situation. Main character is a girl who can protect herself in a sea of other fragile girls. Add on the two hot suitors, who not only do both pertain to a certain side of herself,(Dark, good) but she just can't decide which one she likes better.Does this sounds familiar?But, really, this could have been very good, had Kady Cross just squeezed out a bit more imagination into these characters. Though I have to admit, Jack Dandy was a bit oddly out of character. He's supposed to be the bad guy, yet, he makes her breakfast, packs her stuff for her when shes going to leave, and gives her information even when shes rude to him? Wheres the bad-assery here?HE'S THE GOD DAMN VILLAIN. VILLAINS DO NOT MAKE BREAKFAST FOR OTHER PEOPLE.They have henchman or butlers to do that, it's that simple.Kady Cross could not pull off the Dangerous-crime-boss-who-also-happens-to-be-a-gentlemen. It was just unreal, he just had too much emotion to play it off right. Jack Dandy was just a very lame attempt to be the sweet understanding gentlemen when he himself had a very different agenda for being nice. It did just not go with his character. It's like mixing water and oil, they don't mix.I honestly liked her writing though, but it got to be just way too boring at times. She had a very loquacious way of describing things, but it go to be too much for me sometimes.No, you do not need to describe the color of Finley's trousers and corsets to me. That's all she ever wears, I don't need to know more. I liked this book, but not enough to give it more than three stars.Actually, I wanted to like this book, I thought it would be different, but it just proved disappointing. But I liked it enough that I want to read the next book.Honestly, I wouldn't read this unless I was highly bored and had no other book to comfort me. (Which was my case because i was too emotionally unbalanced to read the rest of The Fault in Our Stars , because I knew I would be crying like a middle-schooler who just got dumped. I would probably be pigging out on ice cream and failing to not watch cheesy movies that will just make me cry more.)"}, {"userName": "Suzanne Lazear", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4433117-suzanne-lazear", "userReview": "Hot damn that was good.

I love this book so much it\u2019s hard to come up with something beyond hot damn, this book kicks ass.Which it does. Why do I love this book so much?Let\u2019s start with the cover. Can I tell you how much I love this new cover trend with the girls in amazing dresses. I want that dress.One of my favorite things about this book is how there\u2019s a collage of cogs and gears on every chapter page. It\u2019s such a neat detail that adds to the ambiance of the book.The gadgets and tech are seamlessly woven into the worldbuilding (as it should be). The story is fun, fast-paced, and original, yet pulls from classics. I love that we have the \u201cJekyll and Hyde\u201d mythos with a female protag. Findlay Jane is a badass, and I do love me a strong, unusual heroine.But this is far, far more than a classic retelling. That\u2019s just one thread that makes up the rich tapestry that is this story. Findlay Jane is only one of the teen characters in this story and most of them have unusual abilities, like X-Men, only set in an alternate version of Victorian London with automatons and my personal favorite, the aethernet. There\u2019s Griffin, the handsome leader, and patron of the bunch. Sam, his best friend, and Emily, the inventor of the bunch who makes much of the gadgets\u2013including Findlay\u2019s steel corset. Together the four of them must work to catch the Machinist, who\u2019s seeks to use automatons to further his dastardly scheme\u2013with a little help from an American Cowboy named Jasper, and Jack Dandy, lord of the underground.Aside from the mystery and adventure, there\u2019s a bit of romance as Findlay is torn between Griff and Jack. You want to root for Griff, because he is this kind and loyal lord who tries to control his own abilities, protect his friends, and do due diligence to his father\u2019s legacy. But at the same time Jack is so tempting, because who doesn\u2019t love a rogue with a sensitive side?All and all, this was a great read full of twists and turns. Kady Cross has her Steampunk worldbuilding spot on. Though this is YA, I think adults will enjoy this just as much and it will appeal both to Steampunk fans and those new to the genre.So, when do I get to read the next one?"}, {"userName": "~Tina~", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2594672-tina", "userReview": "The Girl in the Steel Corset is an imaginative and impressive story. Historical, Victorian, Steampunk, automaton, magic and mystery are all the wonderful elements you'll find locked with in these pages. Those who know me, know I've always had issues when it comes to historical and I don't think I've read very many books to even know how I feel about steampunk, but, I really enjoyed this book!Kady Cross, sets this story with gorgeous flow. Not once did it feel dull or dry, which sadly is my issue when it comes to historical books, the pace was smooth and solid and it was easy to follow along with the characters and the plot line. I've always been a fan of the Victorian language and thought Cross delivered it very well. I also had a lot of fun learning about the automaton's and the mechanics of it all. It's a very fascinating element that I didn't even know that I enjoyed till now. But my favorite part of this story was the amazing cast. I liked all the characters and thought they were all very well developed, animated in there own unique way and all extremely intriguing. Our protag, Finley, is a fiery little thing, powerful, strong-willed, but the dance she endures within herself is a force to be reckoned with. Frighting and wonderful. Griffin is kind, generous and compassionate. He is equally powerful but he doesn't abuse that power. I admire is strength and control. Emily is a gentle and brilliant and I like how she holds herself. Proud and unshakable. Sam is probably the only character that I loved and hated at the same time. I can understand his hostility. Hating what he's become and the feeling of betrayal, but despite it all he's still grateful for it. Grateful. I think that's what I liked about each of them the most. They each have this thing that makes them different, less human, and while some have learned to except it they still loath it, but are just as grateful for it. That's quite the conflict, which makes this even more of an entertaining factor.As much as I liked the storyline and the concept, there was one thing that sort of lacked, and that was I miss my dose of romance. See, I'm a sap in the biggest way a sap can be, and I need that healthy amount of romance in my reads. But, there were a few scenes that still made me smile so I hope that Cross will explore that in future books. But other then that, I had a good time reading this book. The plot line and concept was creative and clever while the characters are all very fascinating and I loved the teamwork/togetherness chemistry they all give off one another.

has been my favorite.\u00a0 Ms. Cross includes some fantastic steampunk elements.\u00a0 My favorites were the steel corset and the robot cat.\u00a0 These are just two of the many unique and clever steampunk contraptions in this book.\u00a0 If you are fan of steampunk, I highly recommend you give this book a read.\u00a0 I only wish that this novel had pictures of all this great stuff.\u00a0 The steel corset sounds lovely with its intricate flowers and unique design.\u00a0 Who says protective gear can't be fashionable?\u00a0*Ms. Cross creates great characters.\u00a0 Finley Jayne with her unique affliction is able to fight her way out of danger.\u00a0 She can beat up almost anyone.\u00a0 If you love strong female leads, Finley Jayne won't disappoint.\u00a0 I really adored Emily, she is an intelligent Irish lass who is a skilled mechanic, inventor and even a medic.\u00a0 I loved that both the female characters were smart, strong and very capable and that they possessed qualities that are usually associated with men.\u00a0 The two gents, Sam and Griffin round out the group and they are fascinating, considering that they both have some interesting abilities and secrets as well.\u00a0 \u00a0*This is a retelling of Jekyll and Hyde except with a twist.\u00a0 This time the afflicted is a young girl, Finley, and she has no knowledge of the how or why she has a dual personality.\u00a0 I had fun uncovering the secrets of her personality, as well as watching her battle her dark side.\u00a0 I admit, I loved it when her dark side took control.\u00a0 I completely enjoyed this new spin on an old classic.*This book presents a plot with layers of subplots.\u00a0 There is the focus on Finley and her condition, the conflict that Sam is waging with himself, the attacks by the machines, the solving of the murder mystery and the unmasking of the machinist.\u00a0 I always appreciate books with layers of story lines and this book provides plenty of threads to follow.\u00a0*Finally, I was thrilled that Ms. Cross provides a nice resolution while providing some interesting new ideas to follow up on in the sequel.\u00a0 No cliffhanger!\u00a0*For the record, I love the name Finley Jayne!And The Not So Much:*If you are looking for a good romance, this might be a disappointment.\u00a0 There isn't a complete development of a romantic relationship.\u00a0 Instead Ms. Cross teases us with potential sparks and promises.\u00a0 She keeps you guessing as to whether or not Finley will fall for a certain gentleman or not.\u00a0 On a side note, there is a tiny flame between two of the secondary characters, which I liked.\u00a0*This book sort of tries to present a love triangle but it is not established.\u00a0 Finley's dark side draws her to Jack Dandy, a criminal leader in the underworld.\u00a0 I adored Jack.\u00a0 There was something about this bad boy that just made me smile.\u00a0 He is charming and believe it or not a gentleman, but one that must be handled carefully, he is a bad boy after all.\u00a0 I loved the way he talked, especially his pet name for Finley which is \"Treasure\".\u00a0 I wanted more of Mr. Dandy.\u00a0*I was left with a couple of nagging questions.\u00a0 One was who was the murderer of Finley's assailant?\u00a0 Another sticking point was Jasper Renn.\u00a0 He is an American Cowboy, but he remains a mystery.\u00a0 He seems to have some unique abilities of his own that are never disclosed.\u00a0 However, at the end of the book it was apparent that the sequel is going to focus on Jasper.\u00a0 Hopefully, I will get the answers to my questions.\u00a0*This novel is labeled as Young Adult.\u00a0 I personally think that this book is beyond the YA label.\u00a0 Not due to inappropriate content, but because it transcends the normal YA classifications.\u00a0 The characters are mature and act like adults even though they are young and the plot itself is beyond the typical YA lines.\u00a0 This is a book that can be enjoyed by adults as well as young adults.\u00a0 Don't let the YA label deter you if you typically steer clear of YA books, this is a book that will appeal to fans of all ages.\u00a0The Girl in the Steel Corset was a fast and thrilling read.\u00a0 If you love steampunk, you will appreciate all the imaginative gadgets and gizmos as well as the references to corsets, gloves, hairpins and all the fashion that steampunk enthusiasts adore.\u00a0 This book is more than a pretty cover and I enjoyed the fantastic multi layered story line.\u00a0 If you have been considering this book, waste no more time, get it! I am glad that I have book two, The Girl in the Clockwork Collar to tear into next!Favorite Quotations:\"An aura of danger clung to her like an oil slick.\u00a0 Unfortunately, he couldn't tell if she was in danger, or if she was danger.\"\"Pencils were excellent for hairstyling.\u00a0 They also made very effective weapons if the need arose.\"\"Watching his expression change was like watching thunderclouds suddenly blot out the entire sky.\"\"She had to be family because she and Griff had the same eyes---like a spring sky about to be taken over by storm clouds.\"\"She'll never be able to be part of something while she's two halves of a broken whole.\"\"I promise you I will be careful with my affections, but beyond that I can offer nothing else.\u00a0 I cannot tell my heart what to feel.\"\"She's two personas struggling for dominance in one body.\"\"Although, Dandy could be very charming, and girls seemed to like the dangerous fellows---some foolish rot about reformed rakes making the best husbands.\"\"It was like someone lit a candle inside him, a small flickering flame that warmed him from inside out.\"Orginally posted at http://rainydayramblings.typepad.com/"}, {"userName": "Shera (Book Whispers)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3167178-shera-book-whispers", "userReview": "The Girl in the Steel Corset is everything I have been dying to find in a steampunk novel. The technology flavors the world perfectly and I love that there's so many different verities of fashion. This is a whole new reimagined world! One where 20 years prior an expedition lead by the Duke of Greythorne journeyed to the center of the earth. Discovery of the Cradle of Life, THE place were creation began. Strange things called The Organites where discovered. Tiny organisms that can mimic other things on a cellular level. While the general public is only aware of some ore that powers the technology from this expedition. Every thing else is kept hush, hush by order of the Queen. So now we're 20 years later after these events. Where despite keeping everything a secret things are definitely happening. People are developing powers because of certain events and there's a villain out there, The Machinist, who wants to use The Organites for evil. It's all very shady with plots against the Queen and reimagining of Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll. There is a lot of technology here leading to a new and different world. Though I have a hard time believing that facial piercing, and multiple ones at that, would be acceptable for a Lady. That's a different kind of advancement. Even the pants seemed far out. Because there were still many rules a lady should follow that contradict those advancements in sexism. But hey that's me being nit picky. Speaking of technology. There is a lot of it here. Finally a steampunk novel chocked full of it! I love the way the machines work and the description of the gears! However, there was some technology that made me pause. Some of it was sooooooooo advanced that it felt like it was out of a futuristic novel, not a steampunk. And if you don't know steampunk novels generally take place in the past. Some in the Victorian age mainly. So that took me out a bit. Hey, they've journeyed to the center of the world! They've discovered the Cradle of Life. Anything can happen.GitSC has a wonderful cast of characters here. Griffin is a suave leader of his gang of misfits, as expected as the current Duke of Greythorne. He's a true hero and I love how it fits along with his humanity. Finley is his social opposite. The best part is she's a fighter and I love how tough she is. Even when she's trying to figure out who she is from circumstances outside of her control. You know there's a romance happening there. The best part is it isn't rushed. Cross is doing what I have missed. Building the romance and creating the romantic/sexual tension. Not to mention Jack Dandy a dark character well worth the swooning and a nice counter part to Griffin. Because there is a love triangle, but at least it\u2019s done well. So it fits really good here. (No teenage melodrama. I dare say it\u2019s realistic.)The other cast of characters are amazing as well. They all stand out and I adore how dastardly gangsters or stupid muscle men eventually flesh out and become likeable characters. People make mistakes, but they learn. Griffin's band of misfits is like a family. The trust they've all earned is moving and I enjoyed watching Finley become part of it. Overall I love all of the aspects presented. Some readers might find it a bit full. There's changing points of views, lots of steampunk technology, people developing powers, the other worldly Aether, historical references, fantastic character interactions, witty humor and dialogue, strange Organite things, and\u2014basically a marvelously brilliant world! It's well developed and quite fantastic. Oh, and I've been saving the best for last. A female Hyde and Jekyll. Boom. Bet you were wondering when I'd bring it up again. The Girl in the Steel Corset was an unexpected treat! If you're new to steampunk or a connoisseur of the genre don't miss this one! Sexual Content: All rather politely clean. There is sexual humor and some hints of more. 4/5- Great! Really enjoyed it.\nOriginally reviewed at Book Whispers."}, {"userName": "Nicole D.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5601819-nicole-d", "userReview": "Finley Jayne isn't normal and can do things normal people can't. One night after being attacked by her employer and beating him up and knocking him out, she runs scared about what he might do to her when he wakes up. When she is making her escape she runs in front of a vehicle driven by Griffin King, Duke of Greythorne and she is knocked out. She wakes up at the Duke's house and finds out she is not the only abnormal one.I loved Finley when I read about her in The Strange Case of Finley Jayne and I love her even more in The Girl with the Steel Corset. I love her stubbornness, independence, uniqueness, her standing up for the weak, how brave she is and many other things. Griffin is the leader of a group of people with special abilities like Finley's. I have a lot of respect for his character. To be in charge of all these secrets and having his parents killed when he was so young must be a great burden. Plus having his own special ability. Emily who handles all the technology is brilliant and kind. I am very intrigued by her character. I wonder what happened in her past to make her want to get away from her family. Sam is super strong but very troubled about what happened to him. I felt bad for Sam and what he had to go through. I understand his anger but you can't let it control you. There is a lot of tension with Emily, Griffin, and Sam because of what happened to him. Griffin's aunt was very freaky with her ability to get into people's heads and hope to see more of her in future books. I really loved Jack Dandy who is a master criminal and look forward to seeing more of him. I have a feeling he is more than what he seems. I loved the scene where Finley learned how she came to have these abilities. It was very emotional and heartbreaking. Finley's struggle to merge both parts of herself is fascinating to watch. Some books you just connect with the characters at hello and this is one of those books for me. Any books were the characters are different and outcasts speaks to me. Finley wanting to find a place to belong is a universally feeling that everyone will connect with.This book has two romances going on. Finley/Griffin/Jack and Emily/Sam/Jasper. The Jack and Griffin love triangle is great. I think each guy represents each side of her personality. But I know in the Emily/Sam/Jasper love triangle that Emily only has eyes for Sam. But I hope Jasper finds a girlfriend in book 2 or 3 or 4. He is one of my fellow country man and a cowboy. The author is doing an amazing job with world building. It is brilliant how she weaves history and fantasy together. I loved how all the little details about the clothes, titles, balls,being rich and how that and a title made you above wrong, how servants were treated in the period,ect... were woven so naturally into the story. I would love to have the amazing outfits described in the book. I loved how the author had all these machines that resembled things today. The writing flowed and I read 200 pages in one sitting. Not even wanting to put down the book for dinner. I loved how this book was so action packed and fast-paced. I was on the edge of my seat almost the whole book. The only thing I didn't like about the book was I figured out who the bad guy was as soon as he walked onto the scene. I highly recommend this book to all who love great adventure, action, friendship, historical fantasy, characters that you can easily connect with, and great writing.Rating: 5 out 5Content Rating: PG-13"}], "description": "In 1897 England, sixteen-year-old Finley Jayne has no one...except the \"thing\" inside her.When a young lord tries to take advantage of Finley, she fights back.

Finley thinks she can help--and finally be a part of something, finally fit in.But The Machinist wants to tear Griff's company of strays apart, and it isn't long before trust is tested on all sides.
