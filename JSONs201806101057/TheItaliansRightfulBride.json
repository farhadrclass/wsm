She is 18 and he is in his early 20s. Joanna is an heiress and Gustavo is a prince who needs her money. It's all very above board, both parties know that this is to be an arranged marriage. When they first meet Joanna falls instantly in love with Gustavo, he on the other hand doesn't reciprocate. However, that doesn't mean he doesn't respect her or isn't warm and friendly to her. He is. Joanna keeps her deeper feelings to herself thinking he'll grow to return her feelings. Gustavo proposes, Joanna says yes. Then comes trouble. Soon before the actual wedding Gustavo meets and falls head over heels for another woman, Crystal. Joanna sees them together and hides her heartbreak by pretending her feelings weren't as invested as they really were and releases Gustavo from the engagement. Gustavo and Crystal get married in the wedding that was already planned for Gustavo and Joanna. Sad right? Sad but the heroine doesn't follow the well worn path of sitting around feeling sorry for herself locked in a virginal tower. Instead she goes to college and follows her passion for archeology and becomes a well respected member of the field. She marries and has a son she adores. Her marriage doesn't work out but she and her ex are good friends and they both adore their son. Meanwhile things didn't work out so well for Gustavo. His marriage was a disaster, Crystal wasn't the person he thought she was, and that marriage ends much more acrimoniously. Set the stage for Gustavo and Joanna to meet again 12 or so years later when Joanna heads an archeological team that is working on a project on Gustavo's property. They become friends and Gustavo realizes the value of what he walked away from all those years ago. However, as Joanna points out it wouldn't have worked back then because Gustavo would have felt trapped and Crystal would always be the one who got away. Meanwhile Joanna is clear that her path wasn't a mistake because she has a son she adores, a successful career, and an ex she really likes even if he's a shallow man.

Of course, his honor precluded him from breaking the engagement. Luckily for Joanna (who was absolutely \"gaga\" for Gustavo) she inadvertently stumbles upon him lip locked with OW, pledging his undying love. Having witnessed this display of devotion from behind a tree, Joanna steps out and ends the engagement with dignity and class. After all, what woman wants to settle for second best? She even goes so far as to dance at their wedding, which by the way, was the one scheduled to have been hers.She eventually marries and has a child with another man, who ends up being unfaithful to her. They divorce amicably and enjoy a wonderful relationship parenting their child. Though, the husband was made out to be a bit of a philanderer in the beginning of the book, you later learn that he actually did love her intensely but got tired of having a ghost in his bed. Which in a way was very sad, because I think they had a terrific chance at happiness. After twelve years, Gustavo and Joanna are reunited when she gets invited to head up an archeological dig at his estate. Of course, his marriage has ended, because OW ended up being a very selfish, vain and greedy woman. No surprise there. As the book progressed, and more scenes played out, I actually found that I liked Gustavo less and less. He was the epitome of TSTL, spoiled and had air of entitlement that I found rather irritating. The best part of the book was when Joanna accuses him of prioritizing her third, behind his pride and his image. I just wished she would have stuck to her guns and gone back to hubby, who I think never really stopped loving her.Oh well, I guess love really is blind.....Though, this wasn't a horrible read, I wouldn't recommend it. There are much better HP's with much better heroes to read about."}, {"userName": "Alexis-Morgan Roark", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2624791-alexis-morgan-roark", "userReview": "This was a hard read for me because I despise these types of books...there's the relationship wrecker whom the hero marries later divorces THEN the hero has a \"come to Jesus moment\" realizes he loves the heroine, and they all live happily ever after.Oh, btw, both the hero and heroine have children from their farce marriages!!!Just blah!For what is was, it was a goodread with an archaeological slant.

It may be because this is the second book I've read today about H's loving and choosing OW before finding a HEA with the h but I'm less than convinced of the romance. Basically H picks the other woman and the H falls in love with her because she positively dazzles him. The second time round, as he's basically been shown that underneath the glitter its all dross, he appreciates the h's more subtle qualities. There's quite a cast of secondary characters, which I think detract from the main romance."}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3301617-claire", "userReview": "Loved how heroine was the mature one -- to let go of him, her fiance, with grace and without tears, once she overhead fiance and OW talking of their love.Loved how heroine and ex-fiance met up again and ex already knew the wrong choice he made because he mistook combustible chemistry for true love and quiet love and peaceful companionship for nothingness. Loved that heroine was way richer than the hero and became renowed for her profession.

Kepergiannya ke kastil milik Gustavo untuk membantu penemuan harta keluarga itu membawanya kembali ke masa lalu dimana saat itu dia pernah bertunangan dan nyaris menikahi pria tersebut.Gustavo sendiri saat ini sedang mengalami masalah keuangan karena tuntutan sang mantan istri, Crystal, dan juga harus menghadapi pemberontakan puterinya yang merasa sang ayah telah memisahkannya dengan sang ibu yang sangat dipujanya.Ternyata selama ini Joanna diam-diam masih menyimpan rasa suka pada mantan tunangan yang dua belas tahun lalu dilepasnya dengan terpaksa itu. Alasan inilah yang rupanya menjadi salah satu alasan perceraiannya dengan mantan suaminya yang dulu dikenalnya saat pesta pernikahan Gustavo-Crystal. Gustavo perlahan menyadari bahwa selama ini dia bisa bercerita apa saja dengan Joanna tanpa batasan seperti yang dirasakannya terhadap orang lain karena statusnya sebagai pangeran. Dia bertekad untuk dekat kembali dengan wanita yang telah dikecewakannya di masa lalu itu.Kemunculan Crystal dan mantan suami Joanna pada sebuah peristiwa membuat Gustavo bimbang. Crystal memaksanya membayar sisa tuntutannya, dia dan mantan suami Joanna juga menyarankan kepada Gustavo untuk menikahi Joanna saja yang memang aslinya lebih kaya dari Gustavo itu sendiri.Kebimbangan yang melanda Gustavo itu mulai mereda setelah Joanna berhasil menemukan harta terpendam keluarga mantan tunangannya itu. Permasalahan puteri Gustavo juga terselesaikan dengan terlalu mudah, cukup dengan akting meminta jangan ditinggallkan yang langsung membuat puteri Gustavo luluh dan berubah tegar?Kegigihan Gustavo untuk mendapatkan Joanna kembali tanpa embel-embel menikah karena harta sempat menghadapi konflik dari diri Joanna. Namun seperti layanya kisah romance ala harlequin, happy ending pun tetap tercipta. Walaupun sang tokoh utama wanita harus menunggu dua belas tahun terlebih dahulu untuk menikah dengan sang pangeran cinta pertamanya. What a waste.Satu hal yang aku suka dari buku ini adalah kekuatan finansial Joanna yang lebih mapan daripada Gustavo dan lebih dewsasa dalam bersikap. Hal ini cukup berbeda dari kebanyakan seri romance lain dimana sang wanita cenderung lebih miskin dari si pria. Yang cukup aku sayangkan adalah kurang tergalinya karakter Gustavo yang terkesan tanpa perasaan dan cenderung lemah dalam bertindak. Well, namun begitu tema yang diangkat tidak melulu ketertarikan fisik saja karena melibatkan masalah keluarga dan topik sensitif yang seringnya hanya ditermukan di seri historical romance, isu kekayaan masing-masing tokoh."}, {"userName": "Roub", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13716731-roub", "userReview": "i absolutely loved this one though my heart broke a thousand times over as joanna lost gustavo. i was devastated when she saw him coming out of crystal's room. he was nuts about crystal and what he felt for joanna now 10 years from then seemed tame comparatively. i'm not sure i want a man to love me maturely. poor joanna, no one seemed to be able to love her without her money. i admired dat she did not let this fact crush her. she went on wid her life, married another man who was also interested wid her money. still, she looked at the bright side of things: she got liam, her beloved son and dat was one irreplaceable gift! the author actually treated crystal and freddy like two cartoons, which was annoying and seemed like she wanted to make joanna and gustavo feel better.
