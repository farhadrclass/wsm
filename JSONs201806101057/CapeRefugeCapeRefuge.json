After all, it is a Christian mystery. That is a genre I have never read. I grew up reading Erle Stanley Gardner and Agatha Christie where everyone jumped into bed with each other and used foul language right and left. How refreshing this book was in light of that!First of all, the author is a fantastic writer who certainly knows how to develop believable characters and plots with intriguing twists and turns. I was drawn into the book from the very beginning--which is quite refreshing. Furthermore, I absolutely loved that there were no bedroom scenes and no foul language! Yes! I could certainly handle reading more books like this. While the gospel was there, the reader did not feel as though he/she was being beat over the head with Christianity. And finally, I pride myself in the fact that I partially solved the crime. I could follow the author's clues, and that really was exhilarating. Rarely could I ever solve an Agatha Christie or Perry Mason case, but I have a chance with Terri Blackstock. I certainly look forward to reading more of her books. It looks as though this is the first in the series, and it would be nice to read the sequel."}, {"userName": "Jerry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5855981-jerry", "userReview": "A real page-turner."}, {"userName": " Marla", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/593597-marla", "userReview": "[identity theft, arson (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Sarita", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37168935-sarita", "userReview": "Everything I read by Terri Blackstock I loved, this book was no exception.The owners of Hanover House, a house for ex-cons and strays are brutally murdered. Morgan and Blair is looking for their parents' killer, especially after Morgan's husband was arrested for the murder. With lack of evidence and multiple suspects, there is a lot to keep a reader guessing.The action started from the beginning, with loads of suspense and intrigue and kept on building. Terri did a great job of introducing the characters and to show the readers there is more to their story, without making it obvious. Loads of twists I didn't expect. For me a great suspense is where I still at the end do not know who the killer is - you have your suspects but it is only revealed when you finish the book. This was one of those books. I was on the right track with my suspicion of one person involved, however, did not expect the true killer at all.If you love Christian fiction, you will love this book. Morgan is a christian, but Blair is not. Both are trying to understand their parents' murder. Both have questions. Blair can't believe in a God who can allow such cruelty. Morgan trust God and know that He does not wish this on anyone, and will work it out for the best.I loved all the character. I especially liked Jonathan (Morgan's husband) and to see how he grows in his faith and trusting that God can truly change a person, even a ex-con with a horrible past.If you are a suspense/mystery lover, I recommend this book - it was a great suspense - especially the end."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5909573-lauren", "userReview": "I had a beautiful review and then lost it. Rats! I shall try again.This book was great. It was a cool fiction novel with a christian theme. The book is about a murder mystery that occurs on an island off the coast of Georgia. It's pretty captivating and I didn't see the twist coming until right at the very end which is a good tribute to the writer. The main character, Blair, is an atheist who is dealing with the murder of her parents and struggling with the issue of whether God is helpless or cruel during our greatest difficulties. I love that when she confronts this issue with her sister, who is a Christian like their parents were, she tells about the story of Joseph. God wasn't absent in Joseph's struggle. He was screaming for his brothers to not throw him in the pit. Yet the suffering was necessary in order to save the nation of Israel. It reminds me of Jesus and His suffering to save everyone. Oh, I can't even fathom the tears that were in heaven then. I mean God had to turn His face. But oh, how He loves us. Oh how He loves.I also like how the book ends. It doesn't really resolve Blair's unbelief and make everything look like a garden of Christian roses. She is still left with the struggle yet something changes. Something is pulling at her heart. That's what I think God's love is like. A constant tugging, a pull towards love. The constant beckoning."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336903-tammy", "userReview": "This the first book I have read by Terri Blackstock.

Enough information to make them appealing, not so much that you feel like you're reading their Who's Who entry. As this is a Christian book, there is a faith angle and it's really well done.

I had also been told that the Cape Refuge series is one which must be read in synchronicity and order - fortunately, I can dispel this. The plot line does form in such a way, that it is setting up character growth and stories for more books, although it is a satisfactory single title. The story isn't as Christian as I thought it would be, but if you're a complete secularist who finds the reference of the slightest references of God annoying, then Cape Refuge isn't for you.Her story was also more focused on the people dealing with the crime and how they go about solving it, as opposed to a major \"whodunit\" mystery. Blackstock's style was a pleasing hybrid of a slower-paced James Patterson and a maternal John Grisham. Overall, what I found disappointing was the rushed finale .It seemed as though suddenly everything was falling into place.Other than that, I enjoyed that it had no swear words or other things of a gratuitous nature ;Blackstock still managed to create a warmth and tone of the characters with their own \"vibes\". It also reads easily, as I read it sporadically over about a 6 week period and could always quickly work out where I was.I won't be rushing to read the next edition of the series and think I will rather read the single tiles of her that I can attain, as there is a story arc for the entire series. (I only have access to book 2). The books could be read as single titles in the series, I think."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742519-elaine", "userReview": "Murder and corruption.

Then she hears of a double murder on the Island and the police want her off the beach. She can't very well get a job looking like she does. She can't afford her next meal. She needs a shower and a place to sleep.

Depending on your reading speed, you may want to block out a few hours of your day, as, if you\u2019re anything like me, you won\u2019t be able to set the book down! This mystery novel is told by a few different characters in the book, but the primary voice is that of Morgan Cleary. She is the daughter of Thelma and Wayne Owens, the murder victims, who ran a half-way house for those in need of refuge and new or found again faith. Something I found really neat was that, as Blackstock navigates the characters from one destination to the next, you can refer to a map just before the title page to really help your imagination, and make you feel familiar with the small town setting, almost as if you were there! While this is a faith-based book, I feel anyone who enjoys a good mystery, can easily enjoy this book, the first in a four-part series. None of the author\u2019s belief\u2019s are shoved down your throat, but it\u2019s also clear she has a deep belief and trust in God.

Although the Owens are well-liked, not everyone is happy about having prisoners living amongst innocent people. Their son-in-law, Jonathan Cleary is adamant about getting his wife Morgan to move out. Shortly after he has an argument with them, they are found murdered hence making him the top suspect..The first chapter was well-written and engaging. The heated discussions and arguments at the City Council Meeting highlighted the residents' understandable concerns about Hanover House. They simultaneously showed how Thelma and Wayne's daughters, Morgan and Blair were united in ensuring that no one shut down the home. The ending of that chapter instantly led to the shocking murders. Unfortunately, everything went downhill beginning from chapter two.Despite the crime and mystery elements, this book was incredibly boring because the content was repetitive and uneventful. By the time I was close to the halfway point of the story, I could summarize the story as follows:Thelma and Wayne were murdered. Everyone is in disbelief. Who could kill such sweet, kind people? They would help anyone. They were such angels. Why would anybody harm them? Did I mention they were kind? Yes, but let me mention it again (since that's what the author did).Jonathan was immediately arrested because he owned the murder weapon. Never mind the fact that the stupid cop, Cade had little to no other supporting evidence. Jonathan: I didn't do it, Cade! You have to believe me!Cade: Sorry Jonathan but right now you look the most guilty.Jonathan: But I'm not! You're my best friend, how could you do this to me?Cade: I feel bad, okay. But it's my job to arrest you even though I don't want to.Morgan: How could you arrest my husband, Cade? You know he's innocent!Cade: Morgan, I wish I didn't have to but the weapon points to him.Morgan: He didn't do it. He'd never do such a thing. You're wrong, Cade!Cade: It's my job to arrest him, Morgan. Believe me, I don't want to.The entire police procedural was not only inaccurate; it was also unrealistic and laughable. More importantly, Morgan was an idiot for not getting a lawyer to help free Jonathan. It could have been accomplished so easily since Cade was unable to place Jonathan at the crime scene and to prove without a doubt that he was the killer. Throughout the story, Cade pretty much did little to no investigating and instead tossed several people into jail without ever getting into trouble. Another thing that bothered me was how all the suspects (with criminal records) had no problems answering Cade's questions. Really? Not a single \"I want my lawyer\"?Besides that, this sentence (among many) made it impossible not to roll my eyes: \"With her library skills and command of the Internet, Blair was usually able to come up with information as fast as he (Cade) could\". That sentence single-handedly dismissed police as utterly pointless because hey, all you need are \"library skills\" and internet access to solve crimes! To make things worse, there were numerous times where Blair relayed information (acquired through research via computer) to Cade. Who's the cop now??The revelation of the identity of the murderer wasn't even satisfying enough to justify plodding through page after page of nonsense. The motive wasn't wholly convincing and the crime didn't quite fit the motive either. In addition, I was only curious to learn more about what had caused Blair's facial scars only to get a mediocre delivery that went like this: Cade found a newspaper article. Read it and told Blair to do the same and voila, the mystery behind her scars was solved! Talk about underwhelming..Overall, 'Cape Refuge' should've been called 'Camp Disaster' considering the awful repetitive content, painfully flat characters and non-existent police procedural."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682283-barb", "userReview": "Two bodies, one spear gun, and a murder suspect.
