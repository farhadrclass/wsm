McKillip wrote this. The author used her skill to write majestic words to describe each character and places, as well as breathtaking prose to narrate the story. If I'm not mistaken, this book was first published four decades ago and that it also won the World Fantasy Award for Novel in 1975. It wouldn't be winning an award if it's not good, right? McKillip utilized her eloquence that made the story of Sybel, Tam, Coren, and of the beasts a truly astounding novel that everyone must read."}, {"userName": "Bentley \u2605 Bookbastion.net", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7971097-bentley-bookbastion-net", "userReview": "See this review and more like it on www.bookbastion.netThis year when I started book review blogging, I realized that I was reading an awful lot of brand new books that were garnering a lot of hype. Not that that's a bad thing, but I decided along the way that when the opportunity presented itself I also wanted to better acquaint myself with older books. Stories that had been around for a lot longer are often written in a different way than the books of today. There's less focus on continuous action moving the plot, and in favor of more of a slow burn and lyrical prose. In a lot of ways McKillip's writing style reminded me of Robin Hobb's Assassin's Apprentice which I also read earlier this year. It's lofty and ambitious, and while the prose sometimes feels a little like it's meandering around descriptions and feelings, every word is purposefully chosen to deliver on the allegory of love and the unexpected places it takes a person. Aside from the comparison to Hobb, there's also similarities shared with the old-style fairy tales, like the ones we might read as children. There are brief moments of darkness, but McKillip instead highlights all of the beauty and wonder of her world and it never stops feeling magical. I can't lie though, it certainly was a challenge at times. McKillip doesn't serve every meaning to the reader on a silver platter. Instead, a lot is inferred during conversations or in the subtext. I think this is the type of story that I could read a dozen times over and pick something new out of it each time. There are also a lot of references to places, people and events in the world that the reader never sees. It all serves to make the setting feel more open and lived in, and while it can be overwhelming, fans of the fantasy genre will find a lot to love there. As a parable about love and loss, motherhood and letting go, it truly is a wonderful read. A lot of fantasy novels become grounded in the fantastic. In the magical battles and swords and shields and plots for power. Those same topics are certainly brought up here, but they're touched upon in an ancillary sort of way as Mckillip chooses to ground her novel in very human struggles instead. It was a lovely take on fantasy, and in a lot of ways the story still feels timeless in spite of having first been published in 1974. A lovely and beautifully written story. 4 out of 5 starsThank you to Netgalley and Tachyon Publications for an ARC of this book!"}, {"userName": "Mimi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2490110-mimi", "userReview": "This book gave me chills. Still does. I went in knowing nothing about it. I mean, I did skim some of the reviews, so I knew it was highly rated and people seemed to love, but other than that, I had no idea what it's about or what to expect, and I had never read Patricia McKillip before.And that was the best way to approach because the writing blew me away. It is simply SO GOOD and has a beautiful fluidity to it that makes it so easy to fall into. What impresses me most is that the prose is neither purple nor flowery; it's just lovely to read. There's a dreamy, poignant, lyrical quality to it, yet it's so easy to read and so concise. There's not an unnecessary scene or line or moment anywhere. Every word serves a purpose, and not once during the read did I feel like the story was wandering around aimlessly. Nothing is out of place, and so much happens in so few pages. And I just love that kind of writing--purposeful and minimalistic in execution. So what is this book about?Briefly: Sybel, a young powerful sorceress who knows nothing of the world below her mountain and wants nothing to do with it, is pushed into the affairs of two warring sides within a kingdom when a baby is brought to her to raise. On one side, there's an insecure king who fears being dethroned. On the other side, there's family of nobles who would like to dethrone the king. Their animosity toward each other go way back. Both sides want Sybel and use her powers for their own, but only one seeks out a way to break and bind her to their will. What follows is an all consuming tale of near destruction.Well... not exactly, but that was what it felt like during the read, like everything was coming apart at the seams, and I could not turn the page fast enough.Sometimes, after a string of bland genre picks, I would forget what it's like to read well written fantasy, but then something always comes along to remind me. McKillip was the perfect reminder.\"What, in years to come, will you have in your life but a silence that is meaningless, ancient names that are never spoken beyond these walls? Who will you laugh with, when Tam is grown? Who will you love? The Liralen? It is a dream. Beyond this mountain, there is a place for you among the living.\"\"You can weave your life for so long--only so long, and then a thing in the world out of your control will tug at one vital thread and leave you patternless and subdued.\"\"Be patient. It will soon be over.\"\"Soon is such a long word,\" she whispered.Cross-posted at https://covers2covers.wordpress.com/2..."}, {"userName": "A.

At the risk of sounding politically incorrect in a PC world, I find her voice uniquely feminine. Her prose is both rhythmical and intoxicating. In this novel of isolation and seclusion, Sybil is brought up by her father on Eld mountain. Her sole companions are animals, which her father calls to the area. When Sybil's father passes away, isolated Sybil - still with only her beasts for company- studies magic to evolve into a powerful sorceress. Sybil expends much of her time trying to call-up a unique creature that might grant her more liberty, yet one day, a man called Coren arrives requesting that Sybil raises and protects a baby. Sybil is soon drawn into a conflict of the outside world of men, and the baby, Tam, matures. The novel explores isolation and individual growth through the love and friendship of others, along with the more darker traits of the human condition - the quest and rivalry for power. McKillip has a deft touch, and both the plot and her unique style of writing will make this a compelling read for most. It's targeted at a young adult audience but I personally feel as though adult readers will glean just as much, if not more, from this strong work."}, {"userName": "Isa Lavinia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1016831-isa-lavinia", "userReview": "One day Patricia A. McKillip will write a bad book and that'll be the first sign of the impending apocalypse. I have no idea how I went through so many years of my life without having read her books. Actually, that would probably be because there are no Portuguese translations and I have to buy the originals from the UK. The Forgotten Beasts of Eld is, in a word, delightful. Like all of McKillip's books the reader is lost in her magical worlds from the very first page. She writes things and they seem to come alive, to leave the written paper and surround you, wherever you may be reading. Honestly, this book was so wonderful I was almost run over by a car while reading it and walking on the street."}, {"userName": "Bookwraiths", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14716035-bookwraiths", "userReview": "Originally reviewed at Bookwraiths.The Forgotten Beasts of Eld is a wonderfully written, richly textured, high fantasy from Patricia A. McKillip. Even though it is quite limited in length, it is still filled with insightful moments and fascinating insights; all of it set in beautifully rendered fairy tale world.Sybel is a young, powerful sorceress, who has spent her life in isolation, her interaction with humans nonexistent. She knows nothing outside of her mountain home, nor does she really wish to know. Her only companions the magical creatures of her home. So when a baby is brought to her she isn\u2019t quite prepared for the emotions this innocent child will evoke \u2014 nor is she ready for the power struggle she will be brought into when someone returns for the child.What always catches me unprepared whenever I read (or reread) a Patricia A. McKillip novel is her unbelievable prose. It isn\u2019t elaborate or flowery, merely lyrical and purposeful. Every word has its place and its use in her narratives, yet she never feels a need to expound unnecessarily. Important events taking place in pages rather than chapters. Concise, meaningful, and lovely. That is how this author writes, and I only wish more fantasy offerings these days mimicked her style.As for the story itself, it was poignant, quick, and emotional. Sybel\u2019s life, her choices, and the ones she love caught up in the quagmire she has unknowingly been drawn into. Her words and response to both the child and that which comes later filled with a layer of meaning and depth which will truly touches a reader\u2019s heart strings.As for any criticisms or complaints, I have none. McKillip has always been a writer I was in awe of, especially her amazing ability to craft an exciting fantasy tale that still finds a place for both dignity and seriousness in its pages, and The Enchanted Beasts of Eld was no exception, making me wonder only why it took me so long to actually read it.Lyrical, complex, concise, and emotional, this novel is one I will be readily espousing to lovers of high fantasy, fairy tales, and beautifully writing. Patricia A. McKillip isn\u2019t an author spoken of very often these days, but she should be, because her works are treasures of the genre.I received this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review.

Obscure, seemingly effortless, magical and breathtaking. I don't think I have ever come across a book like this before in the fantasy genre. If I were to tell you what the story is about, it would not amount to much and there is hardly any worldbuilding, but the writing is so compelling, so powerful, so seductive and beautiful that I just cannot shake the effect it has had on me.The music I kept hearing in my head while reading was the musical suite, The Carnival of the Animals by Saint-Sa\u00ebns, especially The Swan movement.Also there is a strong medieval feel to the whole story and I was very much reminded of the Arthurian myth by the relationship between Sybel, Coren and Drede.

Took me ages to get invested in it (about half the book...), but then it got interesting. I feel like it's because midway, the book changes quite drastically. It starts involving FEELINGS. Love, revenge. Before that? I knew as much as you do what was going on.There are reasons why I dislike high fantasy (or at least high-ish) fantasy, but I still keep trying... I should stop. I am not comfortable with a crucial thing most high fantasies do, and that's dropping 50 inconsequential names of legendary kings and beasts on me in the first page, none of which pretty much relate to the story at all, are described or are even to do with mythology - so basically, I end up with a jumble of interesting sounding syllables that mean nothing to me. Am I weird? This was a big problem for me with this book, and a reason I found to get it hard to get into at first.But that isn't the only reason this book didn't hook first. The storytelling is basically like a fairytale. In one sentence they talk about a thing, in the next sentence, it's suddenly twelve years later and the thing has been done. A baby basically left at the doorstep suddenly becomes dearer than anyone the characters known before. People love each other although they've talked three times and disliked each other during those dialogues. They meet kings and talk with them as of they've always known them... Granted, it does give a fairytale vibe, but I do not enjoy this kind of storytelling because it's incredibly jumpy, and it also feels quite terribly unnatural. I had trouble paying attention.But when it gets past that point, I must admit it does get interesting, and quite dark. And meaningful. If this book was like this in its entirety, I would have surely given it 4 stars! But I almost dropped it at 38%. So 3 stars it is.

Thanks!Released today!\n\n\u201cI need you to forgive me. And then perhaps I can begin to forgive myself. There is no one but you who can do that either.\u201d\n\nA book like this is\u00a0intimidating to pick up. Not because it is mundane, nor because it is necessarily daunting (although it is, in a way).\u00a0No, my friends. This book entails every aspect that fantasy writing is about, and it is truly breathtaking. Being disappointed with other fantasy reads after this book is why it is intimidating.\u00a0Compared to the writing of today's YA novels, this book automatically takes the lead in its overall quality. Its writing style, detail to plot and meaningfulness are (in my opinion)\u00a0so much more when compared to what is out there today.We are dropped into a new world, that isn't ever\u00a0fully explained. Because of this, the reader is allowed to be left with a sense of yearning and wonderment to know more. To me, this is the key element to draw in the reader, and\u00a0to make them thirst for more. Over-explanation of detail\u00a0only \"dumbs down\" the writing to be taken at face-value, rather than allowing the readers' imagination to run wild.\u00a0The tidbits that we are privy\u00a0to are delicious, whimsical, and truly meaningful.Now, to the story...Our main character Sybel, is the daughter of Ogam, a man born\u00a0from a line of wizards. His special powers allowed him to \"call\" many spectacular creatures to live among his castle walls, safely nestled in the mountains of Eld. Sybel, growing up in a world separate from the one she lives in, knows little of the\u00a0outside world. She cares little for the dealings of men, and spends her time tending her beloved creatures, and calling the fabled Lorien, a mythical white bird, to join her.\u00a0Her solitude is interrupted when an unbidden man\u00a0brings a baby to her doorsteps, insisting that she takes the child in and raises him in a place far away from the warring nations outside her walls. She consents, and realizes that she must learn what it means\u00a0to love another human--something she is not used to doing.\u00a0As the child grows into a young man, Sybel develops a strong, motherly connection to him. But as he comes of age, Tamlorn is sought out, and called to rejoin the world of men, and take his rightful place as prince. Sybel calls Tamlorn's father, the king Drede to her to discuss\u00a0terms for Tamlorn. When Drede meets Sybel, he immediately falls in love with her, and extends the offer for her to join him and Tamlorn.\u00a0Because of Sybel's odd upbringing and talents, she has developed a rather cold character. She doesn't know, or care much for the toils of men. That is, until she discovers that she\u00a0is used by one who desires her for her power.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt is not a bad thing, itself, but it is a bad thing to be used by men, to have them choose what you must be, and what you must not be, to have little choice in your life.\u201d\n\nSybel's outlook on mankind transforms into a dark and corrupting thing, \u00a0causing her to unabashedly use\u00a0others to cast her revenge. But her desires for revenge do not come without their consequences.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe giant Grof was hit in one eye by a stone, and that eye turned inward so that it looked into his mind and he died of what he saw there.\u201d\n\nAs Sybel experiences life, love, loss, and joy, she must either grow, or forever be locked in the dark shackles of revenge, hurt, and mistrust. Because her character basically starts from zero, the reader gets to watch her \"transform\" as she learns more about human nature. There are two different points in this book that I didn't necessarily like, and made me take a half-star off:#1 Because this is a shorter novel, changes aren't always allowed enough time to happen without feeling a bit forced. An example of this is Sybel's character. She\u00a0changes so much in such a short amount of time, that it isn't always believable.#2 I felt that the imaginative\u00a0expression could be slightly\u00a0overwhelming\u00a0at times, and could have used a bit more explanation.\u00a0Despite these two things, it is without a doubt that this is a\u00a0beautiful story\u00a0of growth, hardship, healing, and forgiveness. I would highly recommend this read to any lover of young adult fantasy.Random side note: I think that Sybel is the original white-haired, dragon wielding heroine. Not Khaleesi.Vulgarity: None that I recall.Sexual content: Some advances are made towards Sybel, but they are stopped before anything happens.Violence: Minimal.\u00a04.5 stars.A big thanks to the publisher for providing me with a copy of this book!"}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "Somehow, from the midst of feeling dreadful because of this cold, I realised that what I really wanted to read was something by Patricia McKillip. It\u2019s so strange how I disliked the first book of hers I read; I feel like I appreciate her work more with each book I do read. And this one\u2026 it\u2019s fairytale-like, mythic \u2014 a review on GR said \u2018parable like\u2019, and yes: that too. It\u2019s full of epic fantasy elements but the real struggle is between taking revenge and being true to who you really are and those you love. (The phrase \u201cbeing true to yourself\u201d sounds annoyingly clich\u00e9, but I can\u2019t think of another way to put that without quoting the whole book.)McKillip\u2019s writing is gorgeous, and works well with the character she\u2019s chosen \u2014 a girl who has not been loved, does not know how to love; who hasn\u2019t been among people to be drawn into loves and hatreds. And in the course of the book she does learn, and she struggles with it\u2026 There\u2019s a coolness to the book, like a mountain stream; an aloofness that you can get with distance from something, but toward everything. I can understand why some people disliked it for that very thing, but for me it perfectly matched the subject.I like high fantasy, but since so much of it draws from the same well as Tolkien, there\u2019s something all too real about it sometimes. This book, the character of Sybel, are closer to real magic for me, in the same way that the contemplative parts of Ursula Le Guin\u2019s Earthsea books (the sleeping man with the thistle growing by his hand\u2026) come closer to real magic for me than all the magic rings and restless shades in the world.And one last thing to love: I adore the way that the relationship between Coren and Sybel works out.

It was impressive to my teenaged self, but was the beginning of the end for me and fantasy as a primary reading genre. Beautifully written, richly textured, full of those lovely small moments that demonstrate deft and economical world-building. Also larded through with moments of profound insight for my inexperienced self:What do you think love is\u2014a thing to startle from the heart like a bird at every shout or blow? You can fly from me, high as you choose into your darkness, but you will see me always beneath you, no matter how far away, with my face turned to you. My heart is in your heart. I gave it to you with my name that night and you are its guardian, to treasure it, or let it wither and die. I do not understand you. I am angry with you. I am hurt and helpless, but nothing will fill the ache of the hollowness in me where your name would echo if I lost you.It wouldn't hit me how precisely this passage describes parenthood, as well as other profound states of love, until I got there myself. When I first read it I got a shivery foreboding of how cold passion can be. Thank you, Author McKillip, for the forewarning that I wish I'd heeded better.But in the end, I felt I was being womaned. McKillip seemed to me to be speaking to women and, if some random man chose to listen in, that's okay but you're not the point of the conversation. That men were the *subject* of the conversation, and the uncomfortable implications of that, didn't hit me for years. The end of that process in my reading life was The Mists of Avalon. I've said it before: I could feel myself growing a uterus as I read Bradley's book. I don't want a uterus. Fantasy novels of that era all seemed to be determined to reassign my gender, and I was and am very much not down with that.I'm still not a committed fantasy novel reader, though I no longer reject out of hand the mere notion of reading one. The rise of urban fantasy has brought me back to the chairs right by the door under the fantasy tent. I still don't much care for majgickq and teenagers as main characters require some serious persuading to induce me to pick up and read a book.

My local library at the time didn't have a YA section (in fact, I'm not sure the concept of YA fiction existed at the time, though that would change soon--by the time I was in high school, the library had a separate section for teens). The library's juvenile book section was arranged with picture books on one side of the room, middle-reader chapter books in the middle of the room, and one free-standing shelf of \"older juvenile\" books on the other side of the room. This book was on that free-standing shelf. I'd already read a good portion of the middle-reader books and was starting to make forays into that exciting new shelf of big kid books.I'm not sure why this book was there. I wouldn't classify it as juvenile/YA fiction. But there it was, and I read it, and loved it so much I probably reread it three times in the next couple years. I already loved fantasy books, but after these early readings, I started to seek out McKillip novels--something I still do today. She's one of my favorites.Now I think that 11 was probably too young to read this novel, but at the time I loved the strange and fascinating beasts. I wanted to have long silver hair and be a wizard in a tower, surrounded by magical creatures. The more symbolic elements--about what it means to be a woman, how power differs for men and women, the destructive power of both hatred and love--went over my head. Thankfully.Because there's one scene in this book when, read as an adult, is absolutely harrowing. Hearing the heroine (who's entirely self-reliant and powerful) beg was devastating. It upset me. (All good fiction should evoke an emotional reaction, so it was a pleasant sort of upsetting!) When I saw this book re-released and available on NetGalley, I snatched it up. I was interested in seeing if I'd still love it. The answer is yes: absolutely and whole-heartedly. This book holds up to my early infatuation and more. The prose is gorgeous (McKillip is one of the best), and the story is gripping. I still want to be a silver-haired wizard in a tower with magical beasts.

Still, skill matters little when I hated a) the characters, b) the plot, and c) seriously, every single character. And parts of it weren't well done. It definitely feels like an early work; the style I expect in her writing isn't quite there, it has a tendency towards melodrama, the pacing is terrible, and the characters - and especially their relationships - are way underdeveloped. I always feel like there's a bit of a sense of detachment in her books, and I generally like that, but I feel it times a thousand here and it doesn't work. It didn't let me connect to the characters at all; therefore, I couldn't have cared less about them.I most especially hated Sybel though. Not a good sign when your most loathed part of a book is its main character. But there was absolutely nothing about her that I liked. I kind of wanted to punch her. A lot. And, like, every dude wanted her the moment they saw her. Ugh.I really tried to like this, but I just really, really didn't."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3727861-andrea", "userReview": "[falling a little for Coren, and then being very briefly enslaved by a mage hired by the king to turn her into a puppet wife.And from here we move into a vengeance tale. Like most vengeance tales, the person seeking vengeance is depicted as doing the wrong thing because it is their own self they will inevitably destroy in gaining that vengeance. I'm 50/50 on how I feel about it in this context: one of the major reasons Sybel is to be destroyed by her vengeance is the impact on the two men she loves. Tam because the king is his father and he loves that father (with the kind of love that involves looking away and being kept ignorant of the whole enslaving-Sybel part of his personality). Coren because, substantially, of male pride: if Sybel tells him of the attempt enslavement, Coren will undoubtedly march off and get himself killed trying to kill the king himself personally because of \"my woman\" reasons. If Sybel doesn't tell him, she has to jump through all these hoops to keep from him all the things she is doing to gain her vengeance, and then cope with him being all betrayed and wounded because she hasn't been honest with him. I found Coren a bit insufferable during parts of this, and while Sybel was undoubtably heading off for a tour of the Dark Side, a lot of the most problematic actions revolved around protecting Coren's view of her as 100% good and truthful (unlike him, who started their interaction off with a Big Lie). Of course, Sybel should have done \"sensible vengeance\", and immediately sent her swan to bring Tam back for explanations, and her dragon to bite the king's head off. But because Sybel wants to draw out the king's pain (because of how awful he made her feel) she is caught up trying to shield the feelings of the two people she's come to love.[The story never punishes her father for essentially enslaving and raping her mother. But there's a lot of women passed around as chattel in this world.]Sybel eventually substantially gives up her vengeance and a large portion of her power (by releasing the beasts). The story never makes entirely plain whether Sybel (as a woman) is only allowed good-feels and passivity and will be punished for any bad-feels and active decision-making, but on the whole I think she ends up retaining her strength as a mage.[This is odd timing to re-read this book, because I've been working on The Sleeping Life, which involves a powerful female mage dealing with the aftermath of someone attempting to enslave her, of her dealing with lack of power, and yet still lots of power, and what she wants to do with her future. But Rennyn is a vastly different sort of person to Sybel.] (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Susana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7301000-susana", "userReview": "I've just found another Mckillip favourite; wow, this was all kinds of epic."}, {"userName": "The Shayne-Train", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10911019-the-shayne-train", "userReview": "This was a bit denser than the usual bedtime-reading fare, both in the writing and in the feelz.

It has almost fifty years! It's worth noting that the book won the first World Fantasy Award (in 1975).The story heroine is a white-haired, black-eyed wizard Sybel who lives on Eld Mountain with magical, sentient beasts with whom she can converse telepathically. There's a boar, a falcon, a lion, a dragon and other mythical creatures that were magically summoned by Sybel or her ancestors. Her collection is almost completed. There's one empty space - the great white bird Liralen remains out of her reach.Sybel live isn't complicated. She lives with and for her creatures and knowledge. Everything changes when Coren of Sirle arrives claiming a vague kinship and bearing a newborn baby, the son of his brother. Baby may be in danger as there's a conflict in which Coren\u2019s family fights with Drede, King of Eldwold. The baby, Tamlorn is heir to the kingdom. Sybel reluctantly accepts a charge of the child and discovers emotions unknown to her. Like love. The time comes when Sybel will have to return the child to his father who's not who Coren claimed it was. Due to the unfortunate turn of events and the kingdom ruler's unwise decision Sybel burns for a revenge and this urge may subvert her capacity for love.There's a whole package of fantasy tropes here: love, betrayal, revenge, swords, monsters. There's a clear sense of good and evil and very little of grey morality. The plot is predictable and simple. And yet the story doesn't feel derivative. It's charming and has a great flow that makes it easy to follow. On the other hand, characters feel rather two dimensional. Mythical beasts have more personality than Coren or Tam. Sybel remains a total stranger to introspection. Despite this, it's interesting to observe as she steps into the world of human emotions of love and hate. The book is short, so the world-building wasn't too extensive, and the plot had to be resolved in a short time frame. It's possible to feel that the ending was too rushed. Having said that, if you approach it more like a fairy tale than a modern realistic novel it's perfectly acceptable.My fantasy reading repertoire is full of holes. Especially when it comes to classics. I'm glad I've given it a try. I can't say I fully understand why this book is loved by so many people. It was nice and light and full of wonder. But also quite predictable and simple.Enjoyable but not life-changing."}, {"userName": "Victoria Rose", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4478323-victoria-rose", "userReview": "8 year old me collects little statuettes of dragons. 8 year old me climbs trees and jumps out of the branches. 8 year old me cuddles her cats and tries desperately to make them talk back to her. 8 year old me loves to read and writes short stories about two girls who make friends with a dragon on a mountain. Much like the animals in this novel, I felt drawn inexorably towards Sybel and her story. Patricia McKillip seems to have a hold over me, because reading her novels, I cannot help but be whisked back to my 8 year old self. Her lyrical prose and simple yet powerful stories strike a chord with me that I can't quite put into words. Sybel is a character who was everything I ever fantasised I would be when I was young - beautiful, powerful, surrounded by loved ones and animals and books. She lives on Eld Mountain with animals she has learned the names of and called to her. Amongst them are an old dragon who dreams of his gold, a white boar who speaks in riddles, a great black cat learned in witchcraft, and a man-killing falcon. Then a baby is brought to her, who she reluctantly takes in but quickly comes to love as if he were her own. However, this child is the son of the King, which brings many complications to Sybel's doorstep. McKillip's prose is utterly enchanting, steeped in a fairytale-like storytelling. She imparts wisdom:\"I am not afraid of people. They are fools.\"\"Oh, child, but they can be so powerful in their loving and hating.\"And emotion:A sound came out of her, so sharp and grating she did not recognise her own voice. It came again; she slid to her knees on the skins, the hot tears catching between her fingers. She groped for breath, words wrenching from her, \"Help me - I am torn out of myself-\"\"Have you never wept so before? You are fortunate. It will pass.\"She describes beauty:The ghost of Eld Mountain dwindled behind them; the great peak huddled, asleep and dreaming, behind its mists. The land was black beneath them, but for faint specks of light that here and there flamed in a second plane of stars. The winds dropped past Mondor, quieted, until they melted through a silence, a cool, blue-black night that was the motionless night of dreams, dimensionless, star-touched, eternal. And love:\"What do you think love is - a thing to startle from the heart like a bird at every shout or blow? You can fly from me, high as you choose into your darkness, but you will see me always beneath you, no matter how far away, with my face turned to you.\"And she teaches us lessons which 26 year old me is still learning:He was silent a moment, struggling. He said finally, \"But you had a right to be angry.\"\"Yes. But not to hurt those I love, or myself.\" This novel resonates with me in such a powerful way. It's a story about love and bitterness, told with sincerity and depth with a complex protagonist who suffers and must move past it. There's adventure, political machinations, moments of stark beauty and terrible loss. It's nostalgic and enduring and intelligent. A true fantasy classic."}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina", "userReview": "The Forgotten Beasts of Eld by Patricia A. McKillip is a fantasy classic. I don\u2019t remember when I read it for the first time, but it\u2019s a wonderful book and I re-read it every few years. Sybel, the beautiful and powerful wizard and her magical animals are part of this charming, magical cautionary tale about power and revenge. Sybel is the daughter and granddaughter of wizards and lives in a house of white polished stone built by her grandfather, the wizard Myk, on Eld Mountain. She shares this home with the magical beasts called by her father and grandfather: the Black Swan of Tirlith; Cyrin the Boar who still can speak; Gyld the Dragon; Lyon Gules; Cat Moriah; and the Falcon Ter. Sybel takes care of these animals and they, in turn, are loyal to her. One day when Sybel is calling the Liralen, a beautiful large bird with soft, trailing wings, she is interrupted by an uninvited visitor. Coren, one of the lords of Sirle, is at her gate holding a baby. Coren tells her that the baby is named Tamlorn and he is the son of the Queen Rianna (Sybel\u2019s aunt) and Coren\u2019s brother Norrel, the queen\u2019s lover. He wants her to take the baby and raise him on the mountain to keep him safe from King Drede\u2019s deadly grasp. Even though Sybel\u2019s first response is to command Ter to drop Coren from a cliff (which Ter wisely does not do), she eventually agrees to take the baby, saying that it cannot be much more trouble than her animals. After many years go by and Sybel comes to love Tamlorn, she learns the truth that he actually is the king\u2019s son and that the king is looking for him. Coren visits her again to take Tamlorn away from her and back to Sirle. He wants to use Tamlorn against Drede, whom the Sirle lords hate and want to depose. Sybel is unhappy with this: \u201cYou told me to love him. So I did, like I have loved nothing else in my world. And now you want to take him from me, to use in your war games. Tell me now: which of us has the heart of ice?\u201d (35) Sybel is faced with a decision: keep Tamlorn safe from the world of men, which she perceives to be full of hatred and war and violence, or return him to his father, something that Tam wishes. Her decision, which she makes out of love for Tam, has consequences for her and for the love growing between her and Coren. Ultimately, Sybel must decide if avenging a great wrong is worth the destruction of herself and those she loves. McKillip is a lovely fantasy writer. She writes skillfully and poetically and there\u2019s a wisdom to her stories. She reminds me of Ursula Le Guin in that there\u2019s a deeper meaning to her novels. Anyone who thinks fantasy is a genre of pure fluff hasn\u2019t read the right authors. McKillip creates characters who are complex and, despite any magical powers or wisdom they may possess, make mistakes, make decisions based on fear and anger and hate and then have to deal with the consequences. They are real people I can relate to. In this novel, the themes of love and revenge are intertwined. Both Sybel and Coren are people who love fiercely, but they also hate fiercely. Their need to revenge wrongs has the potential to destroy their world. Because you see the world through Sybel\u2019s eyes, you understand her need for revenge and even agree with her, even when you can see that her hate is destroying her. Sybel\u2019s magical animals are wiser than she, particularly Cyrin. Knowing of her plans for revenge, he tells her a short tale: \u201cThe giant Grof was hit in one eye by a stone, and that eye turned inward so that it looked into his mind and he died of what he saw there\u201d (154). What I also love about this book (and every McKillip book I\u2019ve ever read, which isn\u2019t enough of them) is the lyrical writing. Often it is just small phrases, such as when Sybel is mind-speaking with Gules Lyon. She is upset that Coren wants to take Tamlorn from her: He has taken my heart and offered it back to me. And I thought he was harmless (40). Here is Sybel again, speaking to Drede about Tam: \u201cHe is your son. He is nothing to me. I have loved him for twelve years, and you for\u2014twelve minutes, but I cannot hold him here. I can hold a great Falcon and an ancient powerful Lyon, but I cannot hold one sweet-eyed boy against his own wantings\u201d (55). Her sadness is palpable and I grieve with her. After Tam leaves with Drede and she is alone with her animals, Coren visits her, saying she called him. She says she did not, but he insists, saying he heard her voice in his dreams so he came: \u201cYou see, I know how it is when you speak a name into an empty room with no one on earth to answer to it\u201d (64). That\u2019s such good writing! He doesn\u2019t just say, oh, I know you\u2019re lonely; he describes exactly the state of her loneliness and even manages to connect it to how much he misses his slain brother. Later in the book, she begs for mercy from the man who wants to control her mind and her powers: \u201cDo not let him change my mind. It is a terrible thing, more terrible than if you killed me here, now. I would rather you do that. There is a part of me, like a white-winged falcon, free, proud, wild, a soaring thing that goes its own way seeking the bright stars and the sun. If you kill that white bird, I will be earthbound, bound in the patterns of men, with no words of my own, no actions of my own. I will take that bird for you, cage it. Only let it live\u201d (98). Even if you enjoy the book merely as a fantasy tale, it\u2019s very difficult to not see the themes of liberty, the powerless fighting against the powerful, even a definite feminist theme running throughout this book. Sybel is a powerful, beautiful single woman and men want to possess and use her. This is a beautifully written novel about Sybel, a powerful wizard. She is learned, but not wise and her clashes with the world of men educate her in love and grief, hatred and revenge. If I quoted all the wonderful prose from the novel, I\u2019d end up copying almost every line from the book. Instead, I urge you to read this book, first published in 1974, and still one of the best novels I\u2019ve ever read."}, {"userName": "Laura (Kyahgirl)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2906277-laura-kyahgirl", "userReview": "3.5/5; 4 stars; B+The dreamy quality of McKillip's writing draws a person in and makes the reader feel like they are part of the fairytale. I like how this author makes some pretty in depth commentary on society, gender roles, politics and intangible things like hopes and dreams. She doesn't lay it out directly but weaves it into her story.On its surface this is kind of a children's quest story but the underlying messages are deeper than that.

It has this precise, chilly sort of narration, like it\u2019s dissecting this story even as the characters act it out with dramatic, stylized gestures. The sorceress can call creatures to her \u2013 a black swan, a dragon \u2013 and bind them to her. The book is about that, about the power reaching out and grabbing you, about how it hurts you and makes you angry. And how that\u2019s what family is, too, and love.A hard book. As in hard edges. It also does a really good job with portraying a magical assault on someone\u2019s mind as a kind of rape. The word never passes anyone\u2019s lips, but it\u2019s there in the fundamentals of the story, in her horror, in her thirst for revenge, in the instantaneous way everyone around her understands the magnitude of what was threatened. I have . . . complicated feelings about the way a lot of modern fantasy \u2013 and more often modern critics \u2013 gloss particular kinds of magical attacks as rape. Or just flat out say they're categorically the same, I think is what I'm really talking about. I can\u2019t articulate why this bothers me . . . something about using acts of real world violation and degradation as a shorthand to explain why this fantasyland psychic assault from atop Mount Doom is bad? Because not all invasions of the self are the same tenor of subjective horror, and piling all these psychic and symbolic-magic assaults into the category of rape muddies the waters on a word we can\u2019t even get everyone to line up and agree on in the real world? A friend of mine recently sat next to a guy on a plane who believed as a matter of course that a prostitute could never be raped. Not the point, just, it stuck with me. I don\u2019t know. Obviously thoughts still very unformed on this.My actual point being, this book maneuvered that very well, and made me feel the horror and the violation.

Eloquent, beautiful prose and with a strong feminine perspective that makes it stand out from a lot of other fantasy I have read.

Sybel, the young wizardess lives alone in her house in the mountains with only her magical creatures to keep her company that she has ensnared. She is aloof and cares nothing for the affairs of man until one day a baby is forced upon her that she rears with the help of a nearby witch. Years later, when the boy is nearly grown, the king starts looking for his lost son and she gets drawn, little by little, into the affairs of men.

As the story progressed, though, I realized that it, too, deserves five stars. I'm never good at writing about books that I really like. I'll say that the writing is the best part about it. Everyone talks about McKillip's lyrical prose, so I won't go into it other than to agree with everyone else. The characters are well-drawn. The plot is interesting. The fantasy elements are strong. I love Sybel's relationship with the beasts, with Tamlorn, her adopted son, and with Coren, the man she never meant to love. The story is beautiful and captivating (see, I'm using stock review phrases...sigh). I like that, as in the Riddle-Master series, there is a surprise ending that reveals beauty in an unexpected place. I also love that McKillip again uses riddles in her own way, not in the Gollum and Bilbo vein, but in the vein of knowledge and history cloaked in a story. McKillip plucks you down in the midst of Eldwold, and, at first, you feel disoriented, but, then, you quickly become adapted to the world and feel as if it's your own. There are rich layers of history and mystery, of enchantment and legend. There's a marked yet inconsequential difference between witches and wizards, between people who can mix potions and people who can use their minds to call others and make them do things they would never do otherwise. I love Sybel's magic, which is subtle in deed but also in the text itself. There was something else I wanted to say that I love about this book, but it's eluded me... Mainly, I'm impressed by McKillip's ability to build a world, to create strong characters, and to make me feel invested in the action in under 300 pages (this may be what I wanted to say but forgot). The thing I like best about McKillip's writing is that there's an otherworldly quality to it that I haven't felt from other fantasy novels I've read. I feel like I'm reading stories that have been written many years ago. Sometimes, the otherworldly quality is so strong that I almost lose the significance of the words and just sort of feel what the narrative conveys. It took me longer to read this book than I wanted it to because I couldn't read it quickly and gulp it down like I did with A Thousand Splendid Suns, which I read simultaneously. The writing and story are so beautiful that I had to take my time and read it slowly to really absorb the subtleties of McKillip's prose. If that sounds more like magic than like reading, good. That's why you should read McKillip. This was a buddy read with Ruth.
