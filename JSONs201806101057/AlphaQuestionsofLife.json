This is not my typical reading. I usually only read this type of book when it is written from a Catholic viewpoint however, this particular book called out to me as perhaps being useful in evangelizing although I had never heard of the Alpha course.My review hear is strictly limited to the book at hand. I have never had any involvement whatsoever in an Alpha course and cannot say whether I would feel the same way about its presentation. However this book, based on the course, is a treasure. This is an introduction to Christianity, what it means to be Christian and how to be Christian. The book is ecumenical and does not present any denomination as being the \"right\" or \"better\" one. Quotes from great thinkers and leaders throughout the ages from all denominations are included from Popes and saints to Martin Luther and unknown ministers of small protestant churches. Quotes even come from the most unexpected places such as Sinead O'Connor! The author is an Anglican (Church of England) priest which in all honesty makes him a perfect candidate for writing an ecumenical point of view. His denomination is protestant and yet it retains many catholic elements, putting him in the perfect position to speak unbiased of Christianity, outside of denominations. I had started to read the book armed with a pencil to note anything I found contrary to Catholicism but I put my weapon of choice to use very infrequently and the matters I noted are of little importance to the purpose of this review.Best recommended for people who are already seeking. Those who are wavering agnostics and looking for something to help them make the change, baby Christians seeking further understanding of their new way of life and old hands who have lost their zeal. For these people this book will bring the light into your life. Describing who is Jesus, why we should believe, how we should pray, why we should pray, what is the holy spirit and how can we be filled with it, what is evil, how is it relevant today and what is the church? The book is truly extensive. touching on all major aspects without getting into any specific dogmas of any one denomination. The ideas presented are what ALL Christians believe, it is what makes us Christian and marks the importance of the unity we should be seeking as Christians, brothers and sisters in Christ. I particularly found the chapters on the Holy Spirit, resisting evil and evangelizing to be the most interesting to myself, a seasoned reader of theology, yet a convert myself who was not raised Christian. This book is a keeper for my collection and I will be recommending it to the appropriate people I meet in my life."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2159590-angela", "userReview": "can read this everyday :)"}, {"userName": "Will", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12946199-will", "userReview": "What this book espouses is not the christian faith, but a fundamentalist fragment of it.

This book, to me, is sitting down with the wise, old, beloved grandpa that has lived a long, full life. As you both sit upon the porch sipping a glass of ice tea, he begins his story. This book is that story. There hasn\u2019t been a day when probably every single one of us has asked, \u201cWhat is my life all about?\u201d Not only will this book help put that question in perspective, it gives you a thought-provoking walk through a christian view of God\u2019 purpose for us. This book is about the struggle of non-believers and pondering the flights of life without Christ. Does he exist? If he does, where is he relevant to every day life? Questions of Life is 15 chapters packed with informative question and answer segments. He asks a question and provides his views in a well-thought out response. There are references to scriptures and beyond. One of the most humorous parts of this book were the small cartoon drawings on many of the pages that make reference to the topics at hand. Mr. Gumble writes a book that asks is profoundly well-written with principled research.His use of vocabulary is extraordinary and at times, this book read like it was poetically crafted, especially in the use of such phrases as \u201casinine fatuity\u201d and \u201cunhesitatingly behaved\u201d. One statement in this book that stood out for me is this one pertaining to resisting evil: \u201cThere is a close connection between good and God and between evil and the devil. Indeed, in each case the difference is only one letter!\u201dThis book is not a short nor easy read. It\u2019s complex and thought provoking. Plan to have some time to spare when going through this book, chapter by chapter. Although it\u2019s written well, I found at times that it read more like a term paper or college textbook than a \u2018book\u2019 per se. I would have loved to hear more of the author\u2019s perspective, though you do, rather than the vast references to other works, like C.S. Lewis. It interrupted the overall flow of the book, I felt, and was somewhat a distraction.However, I\u2019ve dog-eared and made more notes in the pages of this book than I have in many. The topic is one we can probably all identify with and this is a good book overall to make you stop and think. As mentioned before, the writing just wasn\u2019t my style. * I received a copy of this book free from The B&B Media Group, Inc., as part of their Book Review Blogger Program.

Not many of them, though, are nearly as important and foundational as the questions Nicky Gumbel tackles in his book: Questions of Life.\" He walks through the essentials of faith and doubt beginning with, \"Is there more to life than this?\" and \"Who is Jesus?\" and progresses from there to matters of church life, prayer, and study of Scripture.Gumbel's approach is likeable, easily read and engaging. Still, he comes across as an intellectual, who is well-versed in the skeptic's life and thought. He is able, based on his own testimony, to understand what it's like to question faith and ultimately to embrace it and the book seems particularly intended to engage skeptics and agnostics.For new Christians, this book would provide an excellent foundational course in why we believe what we believe and what our faith looks like when applied to our daily lives. Even long-term Christians don't always know these \"basics\" of Christian faith and teaching, so it could provide the basic teaching they may be lacking.This is no watered-down treatise for the modern church either. He talks openly about sin, obedience, and choosing to follow Christ even when sacrifice or discomfort are involved. He emphasizes both intellectually growing in our belief and emotionally interacting with God rather than remaining stiff and unmoved by His amazing grace.I received this book free from the publisher.

That pretty much says it all. Nicky Gumbel shares his own personal journey from atheist, to agnostic, to acknowledging Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Nicky is the pioneer of the Alpha Course, which ( in Nicky\u2019s own words ) \u201cis designed for non-churchgoers those seeking to find out more about Christianity, and those who have recently come to faith in Jesus Christ.\u201dQUESTIONS OF LIFE contemplates fifteen crucial questions that need answers if one is to be an authentic follower of Jesus. Questions like: \u201cIs There More To Life Than This?\u201d, \u201cWhy Did Jesus Die?\u201d, and \u201cHow Can I Make The Most Of The Rest Of My Life?\u201d In this book, Nicky covers topics such as faith, prayer, the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit, and the Church. He also tackles some sticky questions such as \u201cHow Can I Be Filled With The Holy Spirit?\u201d, and \u201cDoes God Heal Today?\u201d And he does so in a careful, candid, and clear manner, anticipating and responding to side questions that are sure to pop up.QUESTIONS OF LIFE is a warm-hearted conversation from one believer to those who may be sitting on the fence, dipping a toe in the water, or taking the plunge into Christianity for the first time. I\u2019m reminded of an illustration that fits this book: \u201cChristianity is just one beggar telling another beggar where to find bread.\u201d Are you hungry? 5 stars. 213 pages."}, {"userName": "Shailin Ramji", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7451277-shailin-ramji", "userReview": "This book is dangerous. Very dangerous. Why? Because it mixes truth with error, just as something sweet may be mixed with poison in order to fool the unwary.The consequences can be fatal.This book is fraught with errors and unscriptural statements- Nicky's charismatic leanings and faulty understanding of baptism and being 'filled with the spirit' to name a few- but p156 on speaking in tongues really is a display of Nicky's lack of knowledge and discernment. He states that tongues need to be developed. Nonsense! Nowhere in the New Testament was this the case. In the NT, the Apostles spoke in tongues spontaneously as moved by God's Holy Spirit to preach God's word and to be a sign to the Jews.They spoke foreign languages, not the unintelligible goobledegook or false tongues that Nicky advocates. In fact, Nicky's prescribed method for acquiring tongues is the same as that used by Marcus and denounced by Irenaeus (disciple of Polycarp, disciple of John) 1,800 years ago- see 'Iranaeus Against the Nefarious Practices of Marcus' incidentally also used by the Pentecostal and other charismatic churches sweeping the globe.It is not surprising that the book is mainly targeting those who have had little/no experience of the christian faith or doctrine of the gospel of Jesus.Avoid this book like the plague!"}, {"userName": "Kristi (Books and Needlepoint)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1699270-kristi-books-and-needlepoint", "userReview": "This little book is packed with A LOT of information. It starts by asking the question - Is there more to life than this? I think this is a question we have all asked at one time or another. From there it goes on to ask Who is Jesus and why did He die? That is only the tip of the iceberg in this little book. I am preparing myself to read through it again, as the first time through I feel like I just got a broad overview and that it has so much more to offer. The Alpha course is actually offered at our church, and my husband and I have considered going many times, but with three kids, there is always some kind of conflict and it usually fell over the weekend getaway at the end. A weekend that I think we would really want to be a part of! So you can understand why I want to give this book a second and possibly a third read through. I am hoping that my husband will also get the chance to pick it up.If you have friends struggling with their faith, or maybe not believing in God at all - then I would recommend this book to them. It is non-threatening approach to Christianity without any specific church theology thrown in. Everything is straight from the Bible - so you really can't lose."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754448-brenda", "userReview": "In the \"Questions of Life\" by Nicky Gumbel we get answers to some of the most asked questions that a new believer or a non believer in God might have. In fact there are fifteen chapters. Each chapter focuses on a question, with an in depth answer. The author answers questions on topics such as how and why to read the Bible, who is Jesus, and how to resist evil. These are questions that I myself have often wondered about and felt like I was given fuel for thought with the answers I received in this book.Overall, I found this book was written in a down to earth easy writing style that was easy to understand, that will give the reader fuel for thought.
