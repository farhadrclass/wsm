It's about loss - loss of one's self , loss of dignity , of family , having to make peace with your past before you can move ahead , about not being able to forgive and about the capacity for forgiveness and about redemption. There are alternating chapters in the third person narrative on what happened to get Roscoe in prison with chapters in the first person as Roscoe is in prison. You can read the description to get the details or read them in other reviews, so I won't go into those here . I can only tell you this was an introspective, emotional book that is well written and descriptive. It's a beautiful debut novel that brought me to tears when I could feel the despair and again with hope and goodness of people when I least expected it . Definitely recommended!Thanks to Scribner and NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "It is the 1920's and electricity is spreading quickly, but not yet to rural areas. Roscoe, a young married man gives up a job he loves with Alabama power and light, to make his home with his wife and son on the farm left to his wife by her father. He, however, is not a farmer and their marriage is floundering because of his unhappiness until he gets an idea to wire the farm by tapping into the power lines servicing the town. A unfortunate death will send Roscoe to prison, it will also send the black man who helped him, the man who has run the farm for years, to a worse fate, that of the mines. But should one lose every because of one misstep? Is there no chance for forgiveness or redemption?I sometimes check Kirkus after I have read a novel to see what they thought. Sometimes I agree with them, sometimes not, in this case not. They praised the elegant writing and this I agreed with, the writing was amazing. They then went on to say the novel had no heart, this I disagreed with. Yes, this is a quieter story, a moral journey, a novel where forgiveness is offered in an unexpected place, but it touched me. The beginning of electricity, the beginning of the prison reform movement, life in prison, and the questions of what would be waiting for him when he is released. This story is the journey of a man with good intentions, who finds his life derailed but must move forward and make a life with what is left. Found this a most worthy read.ARC from publisher."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "I read this because it was on the long list for the Man Booker Prize in 2016 and my local public library had several copies (and a co-worker had already requested one of the other copies!)This is not a sweeping, multigenerational novel or historical epic, nor is it an experimental or startling work. As such I am a bit surprised to see it on the Man Booker list, but recently they have had a few titles that are about smaller lives. This would be one of those instances. Roscoe is an electrician in the early years of the 20th century, and when he inherits his father-in-law's farm in Alabama, his life moves into a period where he loses his identity, his place, and the respect his wife had for him. So he uses his strengths and brings electricity to the farm and ends up in jail. The novel itself is more about the consequences of this brief period. I read it practically in one sitting because somehow, even though it doesn't sound like much, Virginia Reeves kept me reading until it was done."}, {"userName": "Viv JM", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4243437-viv-jm", "userReview": "This book was a real slow burn for me. For the first half, I was thinking it would be 3 stars at most. The premise was interesting, the writing felt competent, but I didn't really feel at all emotionally invested. After that, it definitely picked up and I found myself much more interested in what would become of the characters, Roscoe in particular. The last few chapters were rather poignant and raised a lot of questions about blame, responsibility and forgiveness. I struggled somewhat to understand Marie's perspective though - she just seemed cold beyond belief.An interesting and well written debut that I feel deserves its place on the Man Booker longlist, though I would be surprised to see it win."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "\"No one gets paroled their second time.

My View:I think what I loved most about this read was the quietness, the stillness. Despite so much tension, aggravation, violence and anger seeping through the pages of this novel, this was a particularly quiet and sensitive read, perhaps the considered responses by the protagonist contributed to the restful way I embraced this narrative; despite the harshness of the conditions, the punishment being served and the crime committed, Roscoe T Martin remains respected, valued and at ease with himself. His wife however is the opposite - full of bile and bitterness despite her freedoms, she is emotionally stunted and withered. Her identity is so closely tied up to her perception of what it is to be female (family/mother) that she is unable to love herself or anyone else \u2013 what a sad character. I disliked her immensely. The two main characters are so opposite \u2013 one open, one closed, on likable, one not \u2013 they are very well constructed.This is a poignant exploration of relationships, power over, the importance of meaningful work in our lives, moral dilemmas, racism, redemption and forgiveness. A harsh penal system is pared back and dissected \u2013 the parts abhorrent and clearly showing the futility of the sentencing and worthless attempts at rehabilitation. The narrative is a classic tragedy; so much unfairness, ugliness and resentment in a small world. Good intentions have tragic outcomes, life choices effect all for many many years. Education is a panacea for everything.

I admire books that can keep you reading with interest even though you know exactly what\u2019s coming, but this isn\u2019t really one of those. What Reeves\u2019s strategy suggests is that the crime and its unintended consequences are not the important thing here, but rather Roscoe\u2019s years in prison and what they do to his relationships, especially with his wife.Ultimately I would have preferred for the whole novel, rather than just alternating chapters, to be in Roscoe\u2019s first-person voice, set wholly in prison (where he helps out in the library and with the guard dogs) but with brief flashbacks to his electricity siphoning and the circumstances of his manslaughter conviction.

Martin, a talented man in 1920's Alabama whose passion and calling was working as an electrician for Alabama Power. When Martin's father-in-law dies, his wife, Marie, presses him to move to her childhood farm. Having neither the skills nor interest for farming, Martin is adrift until he decides to bring electricity to the farm -- resulting in tragedy (the reader is purposefully left to decide how much Martin is actually to blame).The first 2/3ds of the novel was deeply moving. I found myself asking questions about one's purpose in life, what we owe our family members, and the nature of crime and punishment. Unfortunately, after that point, for me the book just started to fizzle. While this is certainly a book that is more on the \"introspective\" side of the scale than \"action packed\" I kept waiting for *something* more to happen.

Roscoe T. Martin, his wife Marie and their young son Gerald are living on a farm inherited from Marie's father. Roscoe is a reluctant farmer, but he finds a way to use his former career as an electrician by illegally wiring their farm for electricity. This crime leads to a terrible accident resulting in Roscoe's imprisonment for manslaughter. Roscoe is a good man who meant no harm, but he winds up paying for his actions in horrible ways that go way beyond his incarceration. Marie is a cold, hardened heap of resentment and selfishness and she's unpleasant to read about. Whatever his crimes, Roscoe did not deserve Marie and poor Gerald certainly didn't deserve her. While Roscoe tries to repay what he owes his family and friends, the constant source of comfort in his life is his work, whatever that might be at the time.

Let's give her 1.5 stars.Starting with the most improbable of story lines -- someone (in the 1920s no less) taps into electrical transformers whose electrical current leakage eventually causes the electrocution of an innocent bystander -- the novel doesn't get any better from there in terms of inconceivable scenarios, unimaginable race relations reconciliations, and flimsy plots all around. The novel rests firmly between a slog-fest and a snooze-fest. (A sloozefest??? Could that be considered a word? It should be.)Reeves writes well enough, but seems to have no imagination or ability to invent interesting probabilities/possibilities. Borrowing heavily from Shawshank, Gone With The Wind and The Roadrunner vs Wiley Coyote, we have a promenade of zombies parading their way through a story that fails to inspire anything but a big yawn. I've rarely met such lustreless, uninspired characters. (I'm reminded of Wiley Coyote episodes only because everybody becomes a runner just for the hell of being chased by dogs, it seems; and of course, everybody gets caught and duly punished. They should be punished for stupidity, in my mind. Where the hell are they running to? And Why?

It should have salvaged his marriage and his relationship with his young son.

There's so much heart-breaking poignancy packed into this novel, but most powerful of all is the feeling of senselessness throughout.At one point, Roscoe laments that all of this is happening simply \"because George Haskins was ignorant enough to get himself killed on the transformers I'd so carefully built to run current to a dying farm.\"In Work Like Any Other, Reeves confronts us with this sense of life's futility and unfairness, but she doesn't strand us there in the darkness.

I was completely spellbound by this story of a man who I felt was unjustly accused of manslaughter. Roscoe Martin was an electrician by trade but left his field to try to work on his wife\u2019s family farm. The work didn\u2019t suit him and caused difficulties in his marriage. So he did the only thing he knew how to do and that was to bring electricity to the farm. And his efforts were successful until an electric company worker is killed when he finds Roscoe\u2019s illegal electrical connection. While there was nothing wrong with the connection that caused this death, all blame is placed on Roscoe since it was an illegal connection.Not only is the death of the worker placed at Roscoe\u2019s feet but everything that happened afterward is blamed on him, even what happens to his friend who helped him connect the electricity to the farm. Roscoe is sent to prison and his struggle with prison life, his wife\u2019s abandonment and the loss of his son is one of the most heart wrenching and riveting stories I\u2019ve ever read.

The farm is struggling, as the meager profits from the crops aren't enough to pay for farmhands to harvest it, and Roscoe, a trained electrician who dislikes farmwork, is embittered about the seemingly hopeless situation he finds himself in, and the relationship between he and Marie and Gerald becomes progressively more distant, although he loves her dearly. Electricity had not yet come to homes and most businesses in rural Alabama in the early 1920s, and farming techniques have not changed much since the years preceding the Civil War. However, high voltage power lines were starting to be run through these areas by Alabama Power, and Roscoe comes up with a plan to provide the farm with electricity, which will allow the crops to be harvested more quickly and less costly. He enlists the help of Wilson Grice, the African American manager of the farm, who lives on the property in a shack with his family and has worked there since he was a boy, who reluctantly agrees to help Roscoe. The plan is initially successful, as the farm becomes very profitable and the relationship between Roscoe and Marie is reinvigorated, but tragedy results several years later, resulting in the arrest, conviction and imprisonment of Roscoe and Wilson.The novel alternates between the past and shifting present, with Roscoe's first person accounts of his life before and during his sentence in Kilby Prison near the state capital of Montgomery interspersed between the third person stories about Marie, Gerald, and Wilson's wife Moa. Roscoe is disheartened by his fate, and to a lesser extent by what has happened to Wilson, who was a less than willing accomplice to the crime but, as a black man in 1920s Alabama, is certain to face a much more severe sentence in prison. Roscoe's personal reflections and experiences form the backbone of the novel, which is supported by the stories and viewpoints of its main characters. Although he is vilified by Marie, Moa and their children, Roscoe is neither a fully despicable nor a heroic character, and the book's author likewise portrays the other characters as complex, flawed, and all too human. Tension progressively builds throughout the book, as each character's secrets are uncovered and their fates are revealed, and I found the ending to be surprising and shattering. Work Like Any Other is a remarkable novel, especially since it is Virginia Reeves' debut. I was completely engrossed in the story and its characters, who will stay with me for a long time to come. This book is the first one I've read so far that is completely worthy of inclusion in this year's Booker Prize longlist, and is one of the best American novels I've read this decade. I look forward to hearing more from this sensitive and talented author."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4186397-jay", "userReview": "For me, the worth of Virginia Reeve's novel is how she explores the ideas of actions and their consequences, crime and punishment, guilt, responsibility, rehabilitation and forgiveness with such thoroughness that living itself is presented as a continuous grappling with them. The focus of sheer labor isn't an escape from dealing with moral responsibilities. Family loyalty and love are struggles with expectation and guilt. My only problem with the novel is my lack of connection with the characters themselves. Reeves is a fine writer with a profound sense of the ambiguities in our concepts of culpability, and yet she seems to fall a bit short in making her characters come fully to life. I wonder if spending the length of the novel within the head of the central character makes for too confining a space for the book's breadth of ideas. Regardless, this is a truly accomplished debut, and a very worthy read."}, {"userName": "Nicole D.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18822136-nicole-d", "userReview": "part of our Shadow Panel of Man booker longlist. https://thereadersroom.org/2016/08/24...This seemed like it was going to be a book like any other and at first I didn\u2019t think I was going to like it, in fact I thought about abandoning it. But there was something about it that drew me in and it didn\u2019t take long before I was completely in love. Poor hapless Roscoe reminded me a lot of Stoner; this totally lovable person who bumbled his way into a circumstance he didn\u2019t seem destined for.It\u2019s not particularly original, and had I not loved the book so much I would have scored that lower.

I was very much taken in, and moved, by the story of the young electrician whose life, and the lives of those closest to him, go horribly wrong following a series of unfortunate events. The question is, will any of these characters be able to let go of their resentment and build new lives for themselves? Could there ever be forgiveness and light, at the end of a long, dark tunnel?"}], "description": "Roscoe T Martin set his sights on a new type of power spreading at the start of the twentieth century: electricity. It became his training, his life\u2019s work. But when his wife, Marie, inherits her father\u2019s failing farm, Roscoe has to give up his livelihood, with great cost to his sense of self, his marriage, and his family. Realizing he might lose them all if he doesn\u2019t do something, he begins to use his skills as an electrician to siphon energy from the state, ushering in a period of bounty and happiness. Even the love of Marie and their child seem back within Roscoe\u2019s grasp.Then a young man working for the state power company stumbles on Roscoe\u2019s illegal lines and is electrocuted, and everything changes: Roscoe is arrested; the farm once more starts to deteriorate; and Marie abandons her husband, leaving him to face his twenty-year sentence alone. Now an unmoored Roscoe must carve out a place at Kilby Prison.
