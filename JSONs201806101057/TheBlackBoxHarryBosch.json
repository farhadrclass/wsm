That bothered me. It was important.The positive:One of the things he does so well is: When Harry first starts a case, I\u2019m thinking how can he possibly solve this? How will he find anything? What can he do? Then he finds one small piece of something and follows it. He gathers a couple more odd pieces of information and I\u2019m still thinking how could he possibly ever solve this? Even later in the book, I\u2019m still thinking that. Yes this is a mystery slowly uncovering evidence. But Connelly does it in a special way which is not predictable and keeps me wondering. That\u2019s a neat talent. I was immersed all the way through. I didn\u2019t want to stop reading. At the end the mystery was solved, but I wanted to see what Harry would do next. I wanted to continue reading about Harry\u2019s life which I guess is the next book - next year. So, it was done before I was ready to be done. But I suppose that\u2019s good.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR COMPLAINT:The narrator Michael McConnohie was not good. He sounded like a TV news anchorman reading the news. He did not show wonder, curiosity or excitement. He made Harry Bosch sound like a normal, pleasant, everyday kind of guy instead of tough, jaded, homicide detective.

And his memories of the riots in Los Angeles in 1992 when the acquitting of the officers in the Rodney King beating caused a terrible wave of looting and fires throughout the city were particularly strong. The murder of a young woman in an alley had never been solved, and now, twenty years later, Harry was determined to bring the killer to justice.With Harry\u2019s partner Detective David Chu by his side, the murder book and box of cards was only the beginning. But with technology being much further advanced than it had been twenty years prior, Harry thought they had a good shot at solving the case. But could they? Would they find the black box? Would those dark days back in 1992 reveal its secrets to Harry? Or was he putting himself in danger once again?16th in the Harry Bosch series, The Black Box by Michael Connelly is an intense read; fast paced, the action is pretty much full on, while a little downtime with Maddy, Harry\u2019s daughter lightens the load. Each time I read a Bosch thriller, I\u2019m reminded of how good Connelly is \u2013 he kept me enthralled from start to finish.

Jespersen, an attractive photo-journalist from Denmark, was found executed in a dark ally in the middle of the riot zone by national guardsmen who were attempting to provide crowd control. But at the height of the rioting, Harry had no opportunity to do anything more than make a cursory examination of the scene before he was ordered away to another homicide. In the wake of the riots, the Jespersen killing was assigned to a special task force and the case was never solved.This is one of those cases that has always haunted Harry and now, twenty years later, the same gun that killed the young journalist is used in another murder. Bosch, who is now assigned to the department's Open-and-Unsolved Unit, jumps at the chance to reopen the Jespersen case and finally provide a very belated justice for the victim.It will not be easy. The chain of evidence is almost hopelessly murky and would frustrate any detective less tenacious than Bosch. In addition to confronting an almost impossible case, Harry is also soon up against department bureaucrats who are interested only in posting statistics that make them look good, who do not share Harry's sense of the Mission of a homicide detective, and who for their own nefarious reasons, would rather this particular case not be solved.Bosh will not be deterred. He makes an end run around his supervisors and doggedly pursues the case as he believes he should. He's desperately searching for the \"Black Box,\" which will provide the solution to the case, but in the end, the term will become much more than a metaphor as Harry uncovers a particularly dark and disturbing series of crimes. As he investigates the case, Harry continues to grapple with the complex challenges involved in raising a teenage daughter by himself. He also has a new woman in his life and this relationship is difficult as well, but watching him juggle all of these responsibilities is a treat, as always. All in all, this is an excellent entry in one of the best crime series in the history of the genre. Twenty-five years after first introducing Harry Bosch, Michael Connelly just continues to keep getting better and better."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4894054-pamela", "userReview": "Oh dear. After the fiasco that was The Drop I was hoping Connelly would redeem himself with this. He didn't. There were no plot twists...none, zero, zip. Here are a few of the problems--granted none are so big as the lack of plot twists, but they are problems nonetheless:1. There was very little about the '92 riot. So little, in fact, that you had to wonder why on earth he even bothered. 2. Bosch's daughter could easily be replaced by a dog or even (gasp!) a cat. She does everything EVERYTHING better than any other kid human being who has ever lived. She is more sensitive. She is more talented. She is more mature. She is boring, predictable, unnecessary, and ever so annoying.3. The book is more a screenplay than a book. Not only does Mr. Connelly use a scene that has become trite and overused in movies (bad guy shoots other bad guy in the head with no warning), he writes it as a movie scene. Here you have the main character with blood, brains, and skull fragments blown all over him and there's not a single word about how it feels. Not a one! Oh yeah, there's the visual description, but nothing about what he felt or smelled or tasted. There's not even any mention of the effect of the sound on the character. It is all visual....100% visual. And this isn't the only scene that is written with \"eyes only\"...there are dozens of them*. 4. Enough with the jazz...Connelly could have used a lot of the time he spent on music describing the look, feel, smell, and sounds of the riot. In short, I hate to say it, but I may have read my last Bosch. What a sad, sad day.*To be honest, this is a problem I have been finding with a majority of books written in the last few years. They are written as though they were movies--scenes are described visually with little or no involvement of the other senses. Try a bit of pulp from the '50s then something recent, and you will be astonished. Those pulp guys put you THERE. You don't just see what's happening, you see, feel, smell, and hear what's happening. You are well and truly in the character's head."}, {"userName": "Fergal", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7200014-fergal", "userReview": "Harry Bosch what can I say?

L.A. Detective Harry Bosch is working on the cold case squad and takes a personal interest in the murder of a Danish journalist 20 years ago during the riots following the Rodney King case. He was called to the scene at the time but the chaos and caseload prevented the police from serious efforts on the case. Piece by piece Harry\u2019s puzzle solving slowly begins to pay off, like when airplane crash investigators turn up the \u201cblack box\u201d of recordings of indicators associated with the disaster. But his supervisor is jealous of Harry and tries to squelch his efforts, forcing Harry to \u201cgo off the reservation\u201d and bend the rules, which ultimately puts him in harm\u2019s way. Harry\u2019s tenacity and quiet courage shine through in the tale, but we get very little in the way of character development. His relationship with his partner, John Chu, is pretty flat, and there is little depth revealed in his relationship with his girlfriend Hannah. His relationship with his teenaged daughter has its moments, as he honors her interest in pursuing a police career while secretly wishing she won\u2019t. Overall there is just no sense that Harry is really challenged. He seeks justice like a bulldog and does not seem to flounder or get very emotional over the impediments he has to overcome. Thus, as a reader I was not as emotionally engaged as in many of the other great works in this series."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8386404-richard", "userReview": "7.5/10I think I could mainly copy and paste my review for the last few books here. This series is always a pleasure to read, it's detective work without the unrealistic thrills (the majority of the time) and is readily absorbable. It may be that you don't remember the nuances of each outing in a couple of years but each tale holds up on its own. This one verged on the slightly unrealistic near the end with some go getting action but it still felt within the bounds of what Bosch would do to give a voice to the deceased. The mystery was decent enough without ever hitting the heights of some of the others in the series meaning that a truer reflection would be 3.5/5.Not many left before I'm up to speed with the series which isn't great as I'll have to wait annually for the next instalment but I think I'll be finishing it sooner rather than later!

Just like the black box in an airplane provides meaningful data to help figure out why the plane went down. In this story, 20 years ago a Dutch woman photographer is found dead in the middle of the LA race riots following the Rodney King verdict. It made no sense for her to be there and when Harry and his partner were called to the scene, the LAPD, completely overwhelmed, was frantically racing from one crime scene to another. Harry was frustrated that he couldn\u2019t devote the time he felt necessary to adequately investigate Anneke Jesperson\u2019s death. Under pressure, he delayed as long as possible, retrieving only a bullet casing from the scene before moving on. Fast forward 20 years and Harry has the case back as part of the anniversary of those riots, an opportunity for him to do her justice. This was a fascinating case that I really enjoyed because it started with a bullet casing to find the narrative for Anneke being in that alley. It was a windy, twisty journey and I just loved the ride. There was the usual dose of aggravating politics in keeping with real life and some interesting outcomes at the end. I inhaled this one, loving every minute of it, even with a completely different narrator (though I had kinda gotten used to Len Cariou)."}, {"userName": "Rex Fuller", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11874992-rex-fuller", "userReview": "Really liked this one, the latest Bosch.

The focus of the plot is interesting, but it felt a little too linear and straightforward, lacking in subplot (beyond his usual run in with his bosses and internal affairs), layers and twists or turns - Harry unearths all the clues, but doesn\u2019t seem to have to work that hard to locate them. The ending in particular felt shallow, rushed and lacked credibility in parts, using weak plot devices to create a bloody climax. After 18 outings (I've read 15 of them), Harry seemed somewhat tired and drawn, a shadow of his former self trapped in a cycle of endlessly reliving his modus operandi as a solo, maverick cop who bends rules and annoys his superiors whilst unpicking puzzles lesser men would fail to solve. For the series to have new life my feeling is the stories are going to need to become more complex, layered and believable, and some of the secondary characters are going to have to come to the fore and there be sustained interaction. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of Connelly fans out there who will disagree, but whilst The Black Box was entertaining enough way to spend a few hours, Connelly is capable of spinning more gripping and engrossing tales (as evidenced by his back catalogue)."}, {"userName": "Fred Forbes", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes", "userReview": "Sometimes you just want to settle in with an old friend and get lost in his world for awhile and it is easy to do with Harry Bosch.

Bosch runs afoul of another person who is in charge of the Open/Unsolved unit he is back on who is out to get Bosch tossed. And due to Bosch ticking off the Chief of Police (seriously at this point how does Bosch have a job) he may be getting kicked after the events of this book. You don't know since that is left up in the air. I do have to say that it's getting a little old that Bosch is always the only person in the world to care about victims. If anything, I say his single minded obsession ends up getting everyone else around him killed. And for such a smart guy he keeps getting into it with people in power. He literally has no one to keep him safe anymore so I am just wondering about the long-game with this character. It's been a year since the events in \"The Drop\" which gets referenced throughout this book. After the events of the case involving Irving's son that Bosch investigated, we find out that Irving did not get re-elected to the City Council. A more pro-police person won the seat. Kiz and Bosch have not spoken after he finds out she used him to set up Irving. Kiz is now a captain somewhere and the Chief is struggling to hold onto his job. The last thing puzzles me since it seemed like based on the previous books the Chief was well liked. But now he's a politician according to Bosch so that makes him a not okay guy. Bosch seems to have few friends and is still dating a woman from the last book he met named Dr. Hannah Stone. Bosch investigates a cold case involving a victim that he and his former partner J. Edgar called Snow White. The victim was found shot to death during the LA riots and many thought she was just in the wrong time and place. However, Bosch believes a gun that was used was involved in several other gang related homicides and starts trying to track down who owned the gun first. We have Bosch exploring the world of gangs in LA and also how this all tracks back to the Iraq War (Desert Storm). This is typical Bosch going blundering around and acting like a jerk to a ton of people. There's also a weird scene when Bosch is reprimanded for calling someone by their last name and he realizes he may have been insulting his partner David Chu for years by calling him Chu, and then proceeds to keep calling him David that was just awkward to even read about. Lord Bosch needs to do something besides listen to jazz. Maybe read a book on how to interact with others or something. His romance is pretty boring and part of me wonders why he is even with Hannah Stone. At this point he has been dating her for at least a year. He knows about her son and even gets into some trouble because of him. I am surprised he didn't cut his losses and break up with her. I guess we will see what goes down between them in the next book. Bosch's daughter Maddie is now 15 or 16. I can't even remember. She is in this book more than previous books though so that's one positive step forward with her character. However, I am going to complain that I found most of the things that Connelly included about her to just be padding the novel. We go off with Maddie and Bosch at one point where he takes her to a simulator that the police use to train. And Maddie is apparently the best shot ever and also has better critical thinking than the average person. So yeah, we are setting her up to be a special snowflake. Sigh. I heard from a fan that he thinks that the Bosch novels are ultimately going to focus on Maddie. I don't know if I will continue with the series if they do. I ultimately find nothing about her compelling. There's really no one else in this book besides Bosch, Maddie, some references to Chu (they barely interact), Hannah Stone, and Bosch's new boss and the Chief of Police. Bosch takes one of the guys from the unit into his confidence, but once again Bosch can't listen to anyone giving him rational advice so that character gave me no joy. He's not talking to Kiz, J. Edgar, his other two partners are dead. Bah. I have to say I ultimately found this case boring. Bosch is focused on this case because reasons. I called BS on the whole story-line (we find out who murdered the victim and why) since it was such a mess with plot holes galore that I kind of gave up trying to make it make sense. I also laughed when it looks like Bosch is finally going to meet his maker, and then someone randomly shows up to get him out of trouble. I mean hello plot contrivance. In the end I just found the book all over the place."}, {"userName": "Ami", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134600-ami", "userReview": "[that Anneke came to Los Angeles to investigate some ex-Desert Storm troopers that raped her back in 1991 (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4089319-tim", "userReview": "I recently wrote a short review of this for my usual outlet -- the reviews are anonymous -- and I think it is one of the best, if not the best, books of Connelly's oeuvre, which now numbers 24 novels and one collection of nonfiction. Harry Bosch is soldiering on, this time picking up the tiniest of loose ends of a case that began during the Rodney King riots in 1992 Los Angeles. Bosch is working \"cold cases,\" in the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit (fans will remember he's nearing mandatory retirement), and reopens the case of Anneke Jespersen, a freelance Danish foreign correspondent, ostensibly in the City of Angels to cover the rioting. Her murder was not pursued vigorously--no obvious clues, no obvious motive--and the city was engulfed in flames, its police forced stretched to the breaking point. But Bosch recovers a spent shell casing, and in 2012, the technology to link it to a gun brings the case to life.Connelly has fashioned a seamless but intricate puzzle of a book, and it hits the right notes consistently. From that tiny thread of evidence, he weaves a consistently intriguing tapestry of character, narrative and observation. At first glance, the book is a classic procedural, but Connelly's gift as a storyteller (if you like his work, you'll inhale this in a few big, deep draughts--and be sorry when it's over) enables \"The Black Box\" to transcend the notion of a genre novel. It is unmistakably great and undeniably compelling. It is also written with a dark and poetic sensibility, which will be familiar to Connelly's fans but seems to me even more distinctive and powerful in this book.I absolutely dread the day Bosch retires from the LAPD and hope that he hangs out his own PI shingle so I can continue to read about him and the cases that engage him."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "[Pulling that guy over out of jurisdiction & then the interrogation.

I only wish that I had followed this series from the start, though at the age of 7 I was more into The Secret Seven crime capers than the type of crime Michael Connelly so effortlessly delivers every single time. What an outstanding series of books and what a character. The Black Box is another gripping tale that sees Bosch once again going up against his superiors. It\u2019s infuriating that they don\u2019t see him the way readers do, that they want him to retire, but that\u2019s why we love him. He always comes out on top with a big fuck you to those who are against him. Here we see Harry dealing with another of the cases he failed to solve that have lived with him ever since and once again I can only marvel at the tale that has been spun here and sees Bosch going off the reservation and putting his own life in danger to get results. Characterisation wise and I loved the scenes with Bosch and his daughter. It seems only five minutes since we found out Bosch had a daughter and now she is a teenager with ambitions of joining the police herself and here we really get more of an insight into their relationship. It\u2019s a believable portrayal that I only hope is continued as this series progresses. One thing I don\u2019t like is Harry\u2019s relationship with Hannah. I like these characters, Bosch, Reacher et al because they are loners. The addition of a woman normally irritates me, unless it\u2019s Rachel Walling who Harry has a history with. This relationship with Hannah doesn\u2019t feel natural to me, it just doesn\u2019t fit into everything else and she\u2019s a character I am really struggling to take to. The ending wasn\u2019t as clean as normal from Michael Connelly and was a bit Hollywood-esque but it was still fantastic and it still left me wanting more. For now I need to make a brief return to the Haller series as I somehow manage to skip the book that features Bosch before the past two that I have read but after that it\u2019ll be right back on to this main series and I can\u2019t wait.

And I\u2019m extremely pleased to say that \u2018The Black Box\u2019continues Connelly\u2019s rich tradition\u2026 The book opens with the LA Riots of 1992, sparked by the acquittal of four white police officers, cleared of the assault on Rodney King. As the violence escalates Bosch and his counterparts find themselves rushed from crime scene to crime scene under the protection of the National Guard, unable to devote time to each murder victim- the majority of whom end up as files in the Open Unsolved Unit where Bosch is now based. Bosch is haunted by one particular murder, that of a female Danish photo-journalist, Anneke Jesperson, shot at point blank range in an alley during one of those fateful nights, and re-opens the investigation into her death. Working on the assumption that every case has a \u2018black box\u2019- a key piece of evidence that will provide insight into a case- Bosch goes on the trail of the missing murder weapon and ends up embroiled in a far greater conspiracy and, of course, danger.Once again Bosch is presented as a moral and focused police officer, evidenced by his interaction with Jesperson\u2019s family and former colleagues and despite a totally bogus accusation on his professional behaviour by his immediate boss and the Professional Standards Bureau, Bosch displays his deep-seated tenacity that this case will be solved whatever the cost. Once again, Bosch is presented as a harbinger of morality, where the rights of the victim are at the forefront and the quest for justice paramount. On a personal level, there is a very nice examination of Bosch\u2019s tentative relationship with his daughter Maddie and a real sense of them getting used to one another and this relationship strengthening over the course of the book. The plot is smooth and convincing and spirals outwards satisfactorily as Connelly introduces a conspiracy amongst military personnel linked to his original investigation and, despite the rather \u2018Hollywood\u2019 action thriller denouement, I enjoyed the way it played out thanks to the pacing and the compelling character of Bosch that outweighs the slight flaw in the ending.Yet again Connelly has hit the ground running with another solid and engrossing addition to the Bosch canon, and this will be sure to please die-hard fans or those lucky enough to be picking up their first Bosch thriller. Definitely a page turner and an excellent read."}, {"userName": "Alex is The Romance Fox", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6663962-alex-is-the-romance-fox", "userReview": "Since I first read Black Echo, the 1st book in Michael Connelly\u2019s Harry Bosch Series, I have become a huge fan and follower of, what for me, is one the best crime series ever written.Throughout all the books, I have seen Bosch growing from the wild, hot-headed and hard-drinking detective to a mature veteran, who\u2019s still fighting for justice in his job working cold cases for the Open-Unsolved Unit of the LAPD. And as usual, using highly unorthodox methods, not afraid to \u201cbreak\u201d the rules if it means solving a case.The Black Box is the 18th book in the series and there are two stories in it.The story opens in 1992 during the chilling and traumatic events of the L.A. South Central riots to work on a homicide of a white woman that had been killed in an execution style in an alley. Because of the chaos during that time, the crime was never solved.Twenty years later, Harry re-opens the case. He\u2019s determined to solve the \u201cWhite Snow\u201d (as it had been named) murder. Watching him work with 20-year old police procedures and \u201cbattling\u201d with the new technology was such fun. To see how he methodically gathers evidence on the case and how he follows the clues that no one else but him would see is a joyful journey. Fitting the pieces of a puzzle together!!! Amazing. Though I thought the end was tied up too quickly with the solving of the case.But the part I loved in this book was Harry\u2019s relationship with his 16-year old daughter Maddie. His love for her, his guilt at leaving her alone so much and the way he tries to let her know how much she means to him was so endearing and poignant. His daughter baked him and birthday cake and gave him a present of Art Pepper\u2019s live 1981 recording (Harry loves jazz) and when listening to one of the songs, Patricia, he tells Maddie that Art Pepper had written that song, whilst in prison for heroin use, to tell his daughter, Patricia, how much he loved her\u2026just blew me away!!!! Harry\u2019s not a man of words\u2026.but I felt a knot in my throat at that very moment.Maddie is quite an extraordinary girl, with something profound inside her\u2026\u2026the scene where she\u2019s crying after finishing reading a book was very poignant. She\u2019s smart and has this insight that is truly amazing. She\u2019s determined to be a cop like her father and though Harry has a few misgivings about her choice, he does things to help her if that is what she wants\u2026like taking her to a firing range for practice.I hope that the author will give us a Maddie Bosch Series one day\u2026\u2026hopefully not having us waiting for too long!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Roger", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16902958-roger", "userReview": "At one place in this book the main protagonist, Harry Bosch, has to wade through mud and, at times, reading it felt a little like that as well. I have read a few Michael Connelly books and, in my opinion, this is not up to his usual standard.Mr Connelly's books usually take a little while to get going but this one was well past 300 pages before anything much happened. There is the usual row with his boss, who seems a total idiot; a bit of byplay around his relationship with his latest lady friend and some fairly unoriginal stuff about him and his daughter. Incidentally, how good is the message that it is right for a 16 year old to be a crack shot and to feel she could be left at home on her own because \"I am sixteen and have a gun\"?The main plot is pretty much writing by numbers with little characterisation and nothing much going on with any of his colleagues apart from Harry telling them what to do (he does not ask, he tells).The ending is contrived and rushed, almost as if the writer suddenly realised he had run out of ideas and had better get the thing finished. Having a character appear out of nowehere to help and not give a reason for her being there is cheating the reader in my view.It is interesting to see that other readers think this is one of Mr Connelly's best books. Strange how views can differ so much. I would say that it is not a poor book, but some way short of the best I have read from this writer."}, {"userName": "Freda Malone", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6938113-freda-malone", "userReview": "Another top notch murder mystery solved by none other than Harry Bosch. I like Harry in the Open-Unsolved cold cases. With barely any clues and no witnesses, Harry manages to conjure even the smallest of hints, to follow and work its evidence to the surface. L.A. riots after the Rodney King beating became a city in flames. A young Harry and his partner Jerry, were assigned to pick up bodies, murders during this fiasco. A foreign, danish, journalist is found dead in an alley, shot in cold blood, and there was no reason for her to be there - or was there? There was too much chaos to do much forensics and a frustrated Harry was only too relieved when her case came up again, over 20 years later.

The story is very detailed and shows how with new technology and a lot of perseverance old crimes can now be solved.Bosch seemed a bit old and tired to me.

Secure the scene. A forensics team will examine the body. A photographer will document the scene. Detectives will collect witness statements, bag any physical evidence, and interrogate any neighbors, door-to-door. Finally, the body will be removed and autopsied.THE BLACK BOX opens with a very different scene. It's 1992. In the midst of the L.A. Race riots, Bosch and his partner Jerry Edgar have been pulled into a 4-man roving homicide unit for South Central. Why a 4-man team? Two of them are riding shotgun. It's that dangerous. They are also rushed. Minutes after reaching the crime scene, another call comes in. Fifteen minutes later, they move on.The action of this story occurs 20 years later. Bosch is on the Open-Unsolved Unit. Seizing on the media-savvy Department's directive to follow-up on any murders that occurred during the riots, Bosch requests the case from that night. It was a case that caught his interest. The victim wasn't a looter or gang member. The victim was a young Danish photojournalist, a white female, whose murder looked like an execution. Her name was Anneke Jesperson.The title obviously references the airline cockpit recording device \u2014 an essential component of any crash investigation. Here, the box is metaphorical. To Bosch, it represents the moment when conjecture coalesces into explanation. Disparate bits of evidence suddenly form a picture that explains timing, sequence of events, and most important, motive. The question that sits on Bosch's mind in this case is: What was a foreign journalist doing in a South Central L.A. alley at the height of the riots? Twenty years of technological advance provide Bosch with a trail. The shell casing he found in the alley matches casings in murders that occurred four years later, and then eleven years after that second murder. One gun, three murders, three shooters. Bosch pursues the Walking Gun.Several avenues of procedure unfold in this book. Connelly is in his element here. Bosch receives assistance from Jordy Gant, an old school detective in the Gang Intelligence Unit. Not only does he describe gang hit procedures, he has kept his file of handwritten field notes, fearful the information would be lost when the Department converted to digital records. Bosch conducts skillful interviews of two imprisoned former gang members, and even manages a house search without the delay of procuring a search warrant. All of these books revolve around a central theme. Here that theme is \u201cmomentum.\u201d Any reader who has put aside reading a book for a few months, and then returned to it will understand the loss from interrupted momentum. Bosch is confronted with several obstacles that threaten to interrupt his momentum. Budget cuts have caused workflow backups. It can take months to get action on requests made to other law enforcement agencies. There is also a political component, once again. As Gant correctly surmises:  \u201c...all those unsolved cases from back then. What if the only one we closed was the white girl's? That probably wouldn't go over too well in the community, know what I mean?\u201d (Location 547)On the whole, I enjoyed this book. It has a strong sense of place and time. The clues are disclosed in such a way that they at first add to rather than clarify the existing puzzle. Bosch is also struggling with his personal problem, parenting his teen-age daughter Maddie. He worries that she might have a fake ID to circumvent age-restrictions and of course, he can't resist. He rifles through her backpack and get's caught. She is furious. Maddie is developing nicely as an interesting character. Bosch arranges for her to run through some simulator programmed situations at the police academy. (She is still determined to work toward a career in law enforcement, just like Bosch). That she takes the exercise so seriously adds an appealing aspect to her character. She also asks Bosch uncomfortable questions about what motivated his to join the LAPD. His answer is interesting.I missed Bosch's former partner Jerry Edgar. As shown in the opening section, he had an irreverent sense of humor that meshed well with Bosch's hyper-seriousness. Connelly seems to still be struggling with developing Bosch's new partner David Chu. Chu and Bosch now have a smooth working relationship, but Chu's role in this case primarily exploits his technological expertise. Bosch's use of online translation tools in working with the Danish-language information seemed a bit far-fetched to me. Anyone who has tried to translate long passages with TranslateGoogle.com or Babelfish.com will be surprised at the amount of sense he is able to make using these tools. Nevertheless, this was a satisfying addition to the Harry Bosch Universe."}, {"userName": "Anastasia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12171404-anastasia", "userReview": "The Black Box by Michael Connelly is the 18th book in the Harry Bosch mystery series. During the LA riots in 1992 there is not much that can be done for the murder victims and the bare minimum in evidence is collected. Twenty years later on the anniversary of the riots, Harry is working in the Open Unsolved Unit and returns to a case from his past, the execution style shooting of an international journalist found in an alley during the riots. Another terrific Harry Bosch story with all the usual elements. Harry always seems to be in trouble, this time because it is thought it would be inappropriate if the only case solved on the anniversary of the riots would be that of a white girl. Plenty of twists and action as we follow his deductions."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36549125-william", "userReview": "Fantastic!

Clues which must be teased from the past and the present.We also see Maddie growing in skills and vision, and Bosch's joy and trepidation in her chosen direction in life.Connelly poignantly presents the deep pain of a brother whose sister has been killed, and whose pain Bosch shares in His Mission for justice, to speak for the dead.

That could be part of the reason that this one felt a bit more like a greatest hits of Michael Connelly's Bosch novels. This time around, Bosch is looking into a murder that took place during the L.A. riots two plus decades ago. At the time, Bosch was called out to the body of a female photojournalist but not given the time to pursue the case to its resolution. Years later, as he works to finish out his career in cold cases, Bosch decides to revisit the case and hopefully find some closure for himself and the victim's family and friends.As I said before, this one feels a bit too much like a \"greatest hits\" for Connelly, mixed a bit with the current trend in Swedish murder mysteries flooding the market. The photojournalist in question is Swedish, thus creating a tie to that country and it turns out there was more to her vacation to America and being in the riot-zone than originally meets the eye. There's also a lot of conflict between Bosch and his boss as the story goes along, as Harry, as usual, follows his instincts and is proven correct despite outside pressure and authority figures up the chain of command who doubt him.The Black Box wasn't a terrible book. In fact, it was quite good and kept the pages turning--as most Connelly novels do. But it feels like a Bosch novel written more on cruise control than really one that could or should push the character and series in new and interesting directions as several of the previous entries have."}], "description": "In a case that spans 20 years, Harry Bosch links the bullet from a recent crime to a file from 1992, the killing of a young female photographer during the L.A. riots.
