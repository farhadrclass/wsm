The series, which runs twenty-four books thus far, has remained strong throughout and is, almost certainly, the gold standard of modern police procedurals.When we first meet Harry, he's already forty-two years old and has been the product of one institution after another for virtually his entire life. His father left the family when Harry was very young and Harry never really knew him. Harry's mother turned to prostitution and was murdered when Harry was eleven. After her death, he was assigned to California's version of child protective services. He spent the rest of his youth in a series of foster homes, then joined the army and served in Vietnam. Upon leaving the service, he joined the L.A.P.D., eventually becoming something of a star in the Homicide Division.The fact that Bosh was a Vietnam vet and already forty-two in his initial outing would ultimately put his creator, Michael Connelly, in something of a box. By the time the series was to the current halfway point, Harry was already in his middle fifties and staring at retirement, a situation which limited the author's options. Still, Connelly has addressed the problem in innovative ways, although one wonders whether, if he had it to do all over again, he might have dealt with the situation in a different fashion.Given that he's forty-two, with a long career already behind him, Bosch appears in these pages as a character that's already almost fully formed. He's a rare animal in the L.A.P.D. in that he genuinely cares about the job and about achieving justice for the victims of the crimes he investigates. Later in the series, he will articulate his motto, which is that \"Everybody counts or nobody counts.\" But it's clear that he's already driven by this principle when we first meet him.For Harry, it's often a pretty lonely road in a department that basically seems to be filled with self-serving cops and bureaucrats who are much less interested in serving justice than they are in achieving their own ends. For example, Harry's partner has a side career in real estate and makes it very clear that the real estate job is much more important to him than being a cop. All he wants to do is put in his twenty years, collect his pension, and go into real estate full time. And if one of his current jobs gets in the way of the other, more likely it will be the police work that suffers.If anything, the people in the chain of command above Harry are even worse. They're much more interested in advancing their own careers and protecting the image of the department than they are in the department's mission to serve and protect. And this means that Bosch is going to be in trouble almost all the time, in this book and throughout his career. Everybody admits that Harry is a brilliant detective, but he's not a team player and his actions occasionally embarrass the department. Accordingly, the Powers That Be would just as soon force Harry off the job and he's constantly battling against his superiors and against detectives from the Internal Affairs Division who will go to almost any lengths to dig up dirt against him.Not that Harry is all that congenial himself. For whatever reason, perhaps because of his background, he doesn't relate very well to other people and it seems at times as though he goes out of his way to offend people, even when they're trying to get along with him. A prime example is his smoking. By 1992, the health hazards of smoking and of second-hand smoke were pretty well established and already, lots of offices, restaurants and other such places were supposed to be smoke-free. Harry could care less and assumes that the rules simply don't apply to him. He's constantly lighting up in places where smoking is prohibited and in the presence of people who specifically ask him not to smoke. Even in the company of a woman he's allegedly trying to impress, Bosch still insists on smoking, even though it clearly annoys her. In fact, he becomes something of an asshole on this issue. It's hardly the way to win friends and influence people, but Harry clearly doesn't care.The Black Echo begins when Harry is called to a death site near a dam. It appears that a heroin addict has crawled into a large pipe and overdosed. The case should be open and shut, and Harry's partner, the real estate salesman, clearly wants to declare it an OD and get back to the open house that he's hosting. But the scene doesn't look right to Harry and he pushes forward with the investigation.Things really get interesting when the body is finally pulled out of the pipe and Harry vaguely recognizes the victim as William Meadows who served with Bosch in Vietnam. The two were \"tunnel rats\" who went deep underground to explore and destroy enemy tunnels. As Harry presses forward he discovers any number of other incongruities and ties Meadows to a crime that is currently under investigation by the F.B.I.Bosch contacts the F.B.I., hoping to link their two investigations in an attempt to solve both the murder case that Harry is pursuing and the crime that the Fibbies are investigating. But the Bureau is just as hide-bound and as self-serving as the L.A.P.D., and Harry runs into roadblocks there as well.Any other detective would almost certainly give up and just follow orders to lay off. But not Harry Bosch. He will pursue this case to the bitter end, no matter who he has to alienate or what he has to sacrifice in the process. And in this case it takes him through a brilliantly plotted story that leads to a tremendous climax. From the very beginning Harry Bosch has been one of the most compelling figures ever to inhabit the world of crime fiction and he continues to fill that role twenty-four years down the road from this book. The Black Echo is a great beginning to what has become a fabulous series."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76688-eric", "userReview": "I came at Michael Connelly backwards, reading the entire Mickey Haller series before any of his Harry Bosch books. And after encountering Bosch in The Reversal, I wasn't that compelled to read more about him. But then I found the Kindle version of this on sale for 99c, so I couldn't really say no at that point.I was not disappointed, but blown away instead. This is a perfect detective mystery tale. Connelly's storytelling gifts are many and varied. He is a master of pacing, has a knack for creating multi-dimensional characters, writes realistic dialogue, a creates a robust plot. The best part is that even after you think you figured out the caper, you haven't, because there are so many layers to Connelly's writing that you've only peeled it back to the next."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Michael Connelly introduced his signature protagonist, Harry Bosch, in the 1992 novel The Black Echo. Over twenty Harry Bosch novels have been published in this successful run for Connelly\u2019s lone wolf, battle scarred hero detective.\u201cThere is no such thing as a coincidence.\u201dSo states Hieronymus Bosch, named from the fifteenth century Dutch painter of fantastic themes. Bosch was a \u201ctunnel rat\u201d in Vietnam \u2013 a soldier whose job it was to enter the warrens created and maintained by the enemy and fight underground. It would seem to be a wild coincidence that he is on duty when a call comes through for him to investigate the finding of a dead body in a drainage tunnel in LA; and it turns out that Harry knew the dead man, a fellow tunnel rat from his time in country.So begins Bosch\u2019s investigation into what happened to his old buddy, and Connelly\u2019s popular run of mystery novels.While this was certainly entertaining and fun, and Bosch is a charismatic detective, mixing elements of the hard-boiled investigator with a modern day, cagey world weariness, this made me think of watching film of a very young athlete who would one day become a hall of famer. Connelly\u2019s later work is more polished, his structure more detailed and his characterizations more defined. As good as it is, this still reads like a debut novel from a talented but still very new author.For a spot on description of the numerous clich\u00e9s, see Kemper\u2019s excellent review.A good start, and it is no coincidence that Bosch has remained a staple for modern day crime thrillers."}, {"userName": "Carol.

Well, actually, first, second and third impressions, but who's judging? Me. Totally me.*Still on the search for a new mystery series, and Michael Connelly's name keeps coming up, mainly because I always misspell John Connolly. John's writing is frequently lyrical and equally brutal, so there's only so much I can take. Perhaps the American Michael will be less demanding? Why, yes, he is. How much less demanding? Well, take this little sample from early on in Harry Bosch's murder investigation:\"He became restless. He looked down into the green glass ashtray and saw that all the butts were unfiltered Camels. Was that Meadow's brand or his killer's? He got up and walked around the room. The faint smell of urine hit him again. He walked back into the bedroom. He opened the drawers of the bureau and stared at their contents once more. Nothing turned in his mind. He went to the window and looked out at the back end of another apartment building across an alley. There was a man with a supermarket cart in the alley. He was poking through a Dumpster with a stick. The car was half full of aluminum cans. Bosch walked away and sat down on the bed and put his head back against the wall where the headboard should have been and the white paint was a dingy gray. The wall felt cool against his back.\"Speechless. Mrs. Meunch, my ninth grade Advanced English teacher, would have emptied her pen of red ink had I turned in that paragraph. Dull, repetitive, uninteresting construction and description, as well as virtually meaningless in plot advancement. But here's where first impressions mislead: given that Connelly worked as a journalist, I didn't think his writing skills were that limited on purpose, and a sample chapter at the end of this book for his series starring a lawyer provided proof of a more sophisticated style. I suspect he was trying to echo both the staccato noir voice, as well as the neutral, progressive statements one might find in a police or medical report, that are supposed to be how things 'are' instead of with interpretation. It probably doesn't hurt that the style might also appeal to the mass market in digestibility.That said, it ended up being an entertaining read. Connelly can't help himself, and as the investigation heats up, the language becomes more complex to handle the demands of perception and action. It ended up pulling me through the dusty Dr. Seuss language into a complex web of conflict between Harry Bosch, his current supervisor, Internal Affairs, the FBI and a hidden killer. Although I felt sure some of the situations introduced were red herrings--and boy, was Bosch downright stupid a couple of times--I wasn't sure of where it would end up. I liked that there was some unpredictability, as so few mass-market books actually surprise me.The book shows it's age, particularly the lack of cell phones, with the time period reliance on pagers and pay phones. Harry was always trying to get someone to run something on a computer for him (!) and everyone was bitching about typewritten reports, and the proportion of typewriters to detectives. However, that may be an appeal for some readers. I'm thinking it'd be worth giving to my dad, former cop and Vietnam vet, who still hasn't used a cell phone and only adopted an answering machine with technological support from friends.Overall, while Harry Bosch is no Matt Scudder, I'd say it's not a bad series to break up my fantasy and sci-fi reads. We'll see if it follows the Spencer pattern of going downhill once Connelly achieves mass-market success. * This book also meets the Mom Seal of Approval: \"it's hard to put down.\"Three and a half stars."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23580633-diane", "userReview": "Great read! interesting and entertaining series...M.Connelly never fails with his writing...(paperback!)"}, {"userName": "Beatriz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46560610-beatriz", "userReview": "Reto #12 PopSugar 2017: Un bestseller de un g\u00e9nero que normalmente no leas\nReconozco que si no hubiera sido escogido en un Club de Lectura, probablemente nunca habr\u00eda le\u00eddo este libro.

I am a devoted fan of the Amazon Prime series, Bosch, which is coming up to it's 4th season. Reading the book I kept picturing Harry Bosch with the face of Titus Welliver, the wonderful actor who so brilliantly portrays him.The story begins with the death of a junkie, that normally would have been written off as an overdose, were it not for the fact that Harry knew the man both in the present and the past. They served together as \"tunnel rats\" in the Vietnam war. Their job was to find the tunnels that the north vietnamese had dug so that they could move through the tunnels instead of above ground. Then it was their job to go down into \"the black echo\" and set fuses to blow them up. The dead man, Meadows, had actually come to like going down in those tunnels and even after his tour of duty was over, he stayed on. Bosch went home and into the police force.Harry doesn't think that Meadows overdosed and eventually ties him to a bank robbery in which they had gotten into the vault through a tunnel. Information comes out that makes Bosch think that this method is going to be used to break into another vault, but where. He teams up with a female FBI agent to solve the puzzle.Michael Connelly is such an excellent writer that I was definitely was kept guessing. No way was I prepared for how this story worked out.

Connelly is a masterful writer in that he is constantly referencing past cases and old details in his Bosch series. Some of the characters from his other novels also tend to make guest appearances. This book sucked me in to its storyline, and once I finished, I knew I had to read everything else Connelly had written. A few novels were less satisfying to me than others (Chasing the Dime, anyone), but I eagerly await each new Connelly novel. I appreciate his conflicted hero and his precise moral code.

I really enjoyed it.Harry Bosch is a detective in the LAPD homicide division in Hollywood. While investigating a body found in an old tunnel, he recognises it as a fellow ex marine Meadows who served with him in the Vietnamese war. They were both \u201ctunnel rats\u201d who fought below Vietnam in the extensive tunnels. After recognising him, and realising it wasn\u2019t a simple drug overdose that it looked like, Harry gets pulled into a bigger investigation. His bosses want him out of the force at any cost, and his enemies want him dead. The hunt is on for the killer before he finds himself the next victim.This book pretty much had everything I enjoy in a novel. Bit of violence, a mystery, romance, sex, and lots of twists and turns. I enjoyed the audio version narrated by Dick Hill. He played Harry really well and I got totally wrapped up in it. However his female voices left a lot to be desired (not his fault, he is a man after all) and I struggled to listen to his impersonation of women. Especially the lead female character Eleanor.Harry is an awesome character. I will be very interested to see how he develops in the later novels, when I get there. I also enjoyed that it was written in the early 90\u2019s. No smart phones or internet\u2026 Everything took much longer, and the characters were constantly having to find payphones to contact other people. Not sure how we all survived back then!I enjoyed the different storylines within the novel. Loved how everyone was out to get poor Harry, even though he was totally innocent. Sure, he didn\u2019t go exactly by the book but he wasn\u2019t crooked. Loved the tension and romance between him and Eleanor. Loved his ex partner. Thought all the characters were great in their own right. Even Lewis and Clarke!The only thing I didn\u2019t like about The Black Echo was the TOTALLY PREDICTABLE twist at the end. I must have figured it out about a quarter of the way into the book and it frustrated me that Bosch didn\u2019t pick it up until the end.

His background as a journalist shows here. He knows what he's writing about from first hand experience. His writing is clear and based in facts.Harry Bosch (who's real name is, hilariously, Hieronymous Bosch, after the fifteenth century Dutch mystical/fantastical painter who was way ahead of his time), is a maverick LAPD detective. He is extremely good at his job, which involves investigating murders. He's not good at playing the phony political games demanded by the LAPD. They keep him around because he's a terrific detective. But he's frequently in trouble with the brass, who are constantly bullying him (and many of his coworkers). Bosch is an interesting character, even though he's a \"type\" in crime novels---the loner who doesn't fit in, haunted by his own past. Harry was a \"tunnel rat\" in Viet Nam. This means he went into the tunnels to smoke out the Viet Cong hiding there (often with explosives). His experiences in Nam have left him with lifelong PTSD and insomnia.A dead body turns up in a pipe near West Hollywood. The dead person turns out to be Billy Meadows, a man Harry did \"tunnel rat\" duty with in Viet Nam.Harry gets dragged into the investigation. Even the FBI gets involved. He ends up partnering with enigmatic and lovely FBI agent Eleanor Wish in the investigation.Things quickly spiral out of control. There is all kinds of collateral damage from this murder and its investigation. Harry is being tailed by two goons from Internal Affairs in the LAPD, since they clearly don't trust him.I can't say much more about the story without giving spoilers.The LA PD brass are depicted as phony, corrupt, lying, self-serving bullies with zero interest in the people that work for them. Since I was a long time worker in the corporate world, this rings quite true to me. They hate Harry because he's way smarter than they are, stands up to them, and (usually) tells the truth. He also smart mouths them in a way that isn't very diplomatic. They keep saying he's \"not part of the LAPD family\". Connolly's portrait of management generally holds true of corporate management as well, although they are less heavy handed than the LAPD honchos.I guessed a few of the reveals at the end, but not all of them.There was something anti-climactic and unsatisfactory about the ending, as if it were tacked on as an afterthought.Too bad, because this book had me until the last quarter of the novel.Dick Hill wasn't bad as a narrator, except that he kept giving LA PD cops heavy Boston accents, which seemed very out of place."}, {"userName": "John Culuris", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55859990-john-culuris", "userReview": "In the 80\u2019s it didn\u2019t take me long to learn to look dubiously at book recommendations from authors, particularly if the recommender and \"recommendee\" lived in the same vicinity. I would still note, say, Donald Westlake recommending Lawrence Block recommending Brian Garfield, but I would also wait for outside confirmation. With the advent of the internet vicinity was no longer an accurate indicator. For example, shortly after the turn of the century the gang from Busted Flush Press lived nowhere near each other and yet unrelentingly sang the praises of their fellows. Often that praise, both in the past and more recently, was justified. Almost as often there was disappointment--which of course is inevitable. Any art form is subjective. But on occasion there was more to the disappointment than personal perspective.So I came to Black Echo and Michael Connelly proceeded by universal acclaim stopping just short of worship. How is it possible to live up to that kind of advance billing? My standard response, in hopes of giving myself the best chance of enjoying the experience, is to temper expectations, particularly in the case of a first novel. What a waste of energy that turned out to be. Long before I\u2019d finished the book I knew I had joined the chorus.We first meet Harry Bosch as a detective out of the Hollywood Division of the LAPD, which to an outsider might sound like a premium assignment. It\u2019s not. Bosch had once been a celebrity cop, successful enough in the world of 1992 (pre-reality TV) for a movie and series to be based on his work, but after a skirmish with Internal Affairs, Hollywood was as far down as he could be demoted short of outright termination. A grudge is still held by certain members of the department, in part because Bosch is a loner at heart and does not appreciate being a member of a family like the LAPD. We learn immediate that most do not like working with him, although he does inspire a few loyalties. His current partner, while preferring his other outside interest, will do his job and back Bosch when needed. And the coroner goes out of his way to assist him. But for the most part there are very few on his side, apparently with reason. We often witness Bosch being surly or rude to people who are voluntarily assisting him. It begs the question: Why should we, the reader, like Bosch? Care about him? Root for him? The answer? Because the author has decided that we should.Michael Connelly displays his considerable skill immediately. As the detective on call, Bosch is summoned a reservoir where a junkie has overdosed in a three-foot-wide pipe. Immediately Connelly establishes character, mood, and a sense of scene. And he also understands the general rule concerning the use of coincidence: once per story and as close to the beginning as possible. Connelly breaks the former but the reader doesn\u2019t mind. The second coincidence is to bypass the boredom inherent in routine investigation. The first is to establish a personal connection to the case for Bosch. He recognizes the victim as someone with whom he had served in Vietnam. Again, Connelly wisely has Bosch discover signs questioning the accidental OD before he discovers the identity of the corpse.It doesn\u2019t take long for the case to open out into something bigger. The FBI become involved. And Internal Affairs decides to use the opportunity to take another run at dismissing Bosch. At first I feared their involvement would serve as a means of propping up the middle part of the book, to provide obstacles for Bosch to circumvent. I need not have worried there either; they had a legitimate part to play. Connelly avoided every pitfall and checked every box.And I even got a confession. Black Echo is procedural at heart so detailed confessions are an unanticipated bonus. These, I freely admit, are a personal preference. I enjoy the hero tracking down the killer, beating the ticking clock, and saving the day; I enjoy the detective expounding on how his deductions explained all the false clues and led to the solution; but above all I love confessions, preferably with emotion. I don\u2019t just want to know why, I want to hear why. In a reality-based story like this I had no right to expect anything of the kind. And, truth be told, Black Echo would have been a great read without my unexpected gift. With it--even if you don\u2019t share my love of confessions--it remains a great read. Again, a testament to the skill of Connelly. It doesn\u2019t jar. The confession flows naturally from everything that preceded it, the next inevitable step as the story winds itself to a close.Sometimes the popular opinion is right. And I stand with the crowd."}, {"userName": "Edward Lorn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn", "userReview": "I'm not reviewing this book because Kemper's review says everything that needs to be said about.

I can't see Jerry Edgar as anyone but Jamie Hector (though it's a bit strange to think of Hector in this role, because I still think of him as Marlo Stanfield from The Wire. Damn that was a good show.) And I can't see Irvin Irving as anyone except the fantastic Lance Reddick. So, it was a little weird for the characters that I've accepted and appreciate in their show roles are so very different in the book. So very different. I'm not actually complaining. I don't know what went into the writing of the show, and I certainly don't know if it was ever supposed to be a true adaptation. Maybe it's just character inspiration (very LOOSE inspiration) and the show plot was never intended to follow the book series at all. Or maybe they cherry picked from later in the series - that's always possible, considering that the show seems much more modern than the books. But it doesn't actually matter, because I enjoyed both, and I'm somewhat glad that they are so different. It allows them to BE different and not constantly be compared in my mind. But, you know, since we're here, I do have to say that the book felt somewhat unpolished. It was dated, SO VERY DATED, but also just felt like a first novel. I am certain that as the series progresses, the writing will smooth out and the series will find its voice and style, but it seemed to lack that in this book. The Black Echo was rough around the edges, somewhat cliched, and pretty spartan in the style department. Maybe that was intentional, but I think it's just a case of not having found itself yet. I don't think that the series could continue through something like 20 books if they didn't get a bit better than what we saw here. Not that it was bad... but it was not bad for a first novel. Still... for a nearly 500 page book, it was a pretty quick read. It kept me interested and wanting to know what would happen, despite some questionable methods and some really concerning police procedures. I liked Harry, and I liked how vulnerable he was in certain ways in the book that he is not in the show. In the book, he is less sure of himself in some ways that, though small, were telling and important to me. I liked that he didn't always have all the answers - and not just to his investigation, but to... life. So often, these loner cop types can seem as though they have it all figured out and the world can go fuck itself once it gets with the program, too. I liked that Bosch isn't there yet. He thinks his own way, and makes his own plays, and he can be a jaded, cocky shit at times, but he definitely doesn't have everything figured out, and I don't think he's ready to write off the world just yet. And I really, really liked him for that. There were actually a few laugh out loud moments for me in this book, and I loved the shit out of Bosch's sense of humor in those moments. His ways of fucking with the IAD guys had me giggling, even though I was like \"Oh no... you're so fucked now!\" I hope that trait continues on through the series, because those moments of levity are fantastic. I figured the twist a little before the book revealed it, but I don't grudge the book for it. There were only so many ways that it could go, and I only pegged the who, not the why. Again, I think that's coming back to first book syndrome. I doubt if I will call the whodunnit on later books in the series. Anyway, I'm looking forward to continuing the series, and seeing where it goes."}, {"userName": "David - proud Gleeman in Branwen's adventuring party", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10923016-david---proud-gleeman-in-branwen-s-adventuring-party", "userReview": "One mystery I was unable to solve...exactly why is The Black Echo so darn popular?!?The Vietnam War never really ended, not for Harry Bosch. A former \"tunnel rat\" who fought most of the war underground, Harry now finds himself unable to sleep and unable to go into underground areas without suffering panic attacks. But now that he's a detective for the Los Angeles Police Department, Harry's about to learn that sometimes what's on the surface is even dirtier than what's underground. When a former squadmate of Harry's is found dead, his investigation into the murder soon finds him flanked by enemies from all sides, even within his own department. Has Harry survived one war only to be consumed by another one?Reviews are, of course, always subjective. Even when I don't particularly enjoy a book, I know there's still a good chance someone else might. Such is the case with \"The Black Echo\". While I was disappointed with this book, I can see why some people enjoy Michael Connelly, as I recognized that he is a talented writer. For one thing, he is an absolute master at setting the mood...I was truly impressed with Connelly's abilities to describe the settings. All throughout the book, he maintains a dark and dreary atmosphere, and his usage of metaphors are almost poetic (like in one sequence, when he writes how the rumble of traffic above makes a tunnel sound like it's almost breathing). Also, it is admirable how much research he apparently did in order to write this book. His detail in describing every step of police procedures is impressive (although sometimes a bit too plodding), especially when you consider that this book came out before the internet had become ubiquitous, meaning it took a lot more work to do research back then. And finally, the climax is quite thrilling. Unfortunately, when a book is under 500 pages long, and it doesn't really get moving until after page 400, that can come as too little, too late, which brings me to where it all went wrong for me...Overall, I just found this book to be much too dull. The actual mystery simply doesn't have enough twists and turns to warrant a book of this length. Unfortunately, instead of choosing to write a shorter but tighter caper, Connelly proceeds to fill the book with obscene amounts of padding instead! Harry Bosch has a frustrating habit of narrating entire paragraphs of thoughts, and then later repeating the same information verbatim when talking to someone else. If it only happened once or twice, I could have overlooked it, but this repetition occurs a ridiculous amount of times. And then there were the two bumbling Internal Affairs agents who are trying to bring Bosch down. I suspect they were supposed to be the comic relief, but I'm not really sure, since they never do anything even remotely funny. Their names are Lewis and Clarke, and Bosch announces that they're going on a \"Lewis and Clarke expedition\" (and since it's Bosch, he says it at least three times). If Bosch's quip didn't leave you laughing uproariously, then I have some bad news for you...that's about the wittiest thing that's ever said in this book! Lewis and Clarke are far too incompetent to add any sense of danger for Bosch, and they aren't nearly amusing enough to work on any comedic level, so their sequences just feel like a complete waste of time. If Connelly had cut out all the needless repetition and the Lewis and Clarke moments, this book could have easily been less than half its length, and much more satisfying to read!Another problem for me was that I wasn't invested in any of the characters. Harry Bosch is a rogue cop who plays by his own rules, and he does things his way whether his superiors like it or not...if I missed any 80s-movies cliches in there, I can assure you Connelly didn't! Bosch has almost no charisma, and since he comes off as something Connelly came up with after watching a Sylvester Stallone marathon, there's just nothing about him original enough or interesting enough to make the reader care about him. The other players in this drama fare even worse. I found all the other characters to be either too bland or too cartoonish (like the aforementioned Lewis and Clarke) to take seriously. Add to that a mystery that is not nearly as hard to solve as it should be, and you have all the ingredients that make for one tepid story!I didn't really enjoy \"The Black Echo\"...wait, I already said that. didn't I?!? Great, now Bosch has ME doing it! Still, I can see people who are hardcore fans of hard-boiled detective novels getting some satisfaction from this one. If you're looking for a book with a lot of atmosphere and even more grit, then this one may have something to offer you.

Called out on a routine drug overdose case, Bosch soon realizes that the victim found lying in the Mullholland Dam drainpipe is no accident case. Billy Meadows was a fellow 'tunnel rat' in Vietnam and Harry swears to bring the killer to justice.Written and set in 1992, it is interesting to see how times have changed in these 18 years. There were no cell phones, the police used radios, pagers, call boxes, and pay phones; there were no PCs, only a few computer terminals within each police station; no digital cameras, Polaroid cameras were used at crime scenes; and will getting better, there was still sexism and prejudice against gays. That said, the fundamental elements of a police procedural and a cracking good story demonstrate why Connelly and the Harry Bosch series, are one of the best. Our introduction to Harry not only sets the scene but tells us quite a bit about his life. Harry is 40 years\u2019 old in this first book, grew up in institutions after his mother was murdered, also providing an explanation as to why Harry dislike rock music, and was a tunnel rat in Vietnam before joining the police force, where he tends to be an outsider. It is this level of detail in our introduction to Harry, although better editing might have the redundancies of that detail,that sets the scene for this book. Connelly\u2019s attention to detail is also exemplified in his sense of place. We can not only see where Bosch is going, but almost hear and smell it as well. You don\u2019t have to have visited Los Angeles to know Bosch\u2019s Los Angeles. And lastly, the plot: the story was meticulously plotted with some of the best twists I\u2019ve read. There\u2019s even a twist upon a twists. It takes real skill to pull that off. I first read this book in November 1996 but hadn\u2019t kept any notes. When my mystery group selected it for this month, I decided to re-read it, not only for the group but to see whether it had held up and was as good as I remembered. I originally rated it \u201cEx,\u201d and have downgraded it to \u201cVG+\u201d only because of the redundancy, but the overall quality of the writing is there and has remained true in this book and in every subsequent book Connelly has written.

Since I don't reveal plots and reserve my comments to the overall book/author, characterization, style, etc...I just don't feel the need to repeat myself as in most cases  series books if any good at all do remain consistent. The star ratings might change, but not my opinion of the series as a whole.Michael Connelly is a well know and very popular author in the mystery/detective and police procedural genres. Exploding onto the scene in the early nineties with his first six novels, and topping it off just recently with his 18th Bosch novel (The Black Box), Connelly has garnered most awards worth getting. Let's face it, the awards are well deserved, especially for those first novels (more on that later). Having emerged onto the fictional world after a career as a journalist, culminating with his job as crime reporter for the LA times, and admitting to becoming interested in writing fiction as a result of reading Raymond Chandler early on in his journalistic career, Michael Connelly has since involved himself in several collaborations: notable the television series Level 9, and as co-writer with Val McDermid's Wire In the Blood series (and that spawned the wildly popular grim, noir BBC television series of the same name). If you're into Noir than this TV series is a must see.Connelly has a knack for writing suspenseful tales that take quite a few twists and turns before being resolved with a stellar Who-Done-It that has most readers guessing till the very end (at least in his earlier books).Heironymous (Harry) Bosch, the hero in this series, is named after a Renaissance painter who specialized in earthly sins, debauchery, fanciful and gruesome visions of hell, violent consequences from high above if not detailed looks at the tortures reserved for earthly residents. Score 1 for Connelly in choosing a very apropos name for our own tortured detective Harry Bosch.Bosch is a complicated and conflicted character, a character that slowly develops across this series but whose emotive origin lies in the Viet Cong tunnels where Harry got his education in fear: underground, claustrophic, dark, drenched with blood, gruesome deaths, peopled with a savage enemy crawling within the absence of all light, hunting for the American soldiers like bloodthirsty rats. From these dark tunnels emerges Harry Bosch, LAPD detective, bent on setting the world right. From this darkness where pacific military command has sent Bosch to discover the inevitable conflict between a military order and the reality of carrying out that order, we find a detective in perpetual defiance of LAPD authority.The Harry Bosch series, for me, are divided into two sets: the first 4 books, and the rest that follow. As mentioned earlier, the classic early 90's novels were better for me. Books starting with The Black Echo on through The Last Coyote all inherit the tortuous origins of Harry's artistic namesake. Reading these books I could actually feel my heart begin to race as I sped towards the inevitable ending, ones that actually kept you guessing to the very end. One reviewer (sorry, can't remember who it was) says the following of these earlier book titles:[...]Even the titles of the books used to be cleverer. Compare The Drop (a simple reference to Deferred Retirement Option Plan) to The Concrete Blonde (a reference to both lady justice statue on the courthouse and the body of a blonde entombed in concrete. [...]Compare that to the later books in the series where we find a Harry Bosch notably mellower in his older age, where we find endings easily guessed at, where procedure begins to trump a superb plot. Bosch no longer smokes, doesn't drink and drive, doesn't slap people around anymore, where his defiance of LAPD authority is tempered by retirement, and let's face it, where my heart just doesn't race as often anymore. Let's say that his later novels are beginning to show an author's haste (is it me, or are the novels shorter and shorter?)Don't get me wrong, I still love reading the latest Bosch novel. Where the earlier novels have a few things that can be improved on (dialogue could have been better) the later novels are polished, almost a little too much so. After 18 Bosch novels, is Connelly tiring? Maybe.Beginning with the last 90's novel (Angels Flight) in which we are introduced to Bosch's latest romantic interest, Eleanor Wish, with whom Bosch is to have a daughter this mellowing process takes root. Connelly is absolutely right to introduce this notable character shift in Bosch from this book forward because as I can attest to in my own personal life: when you see your child born, a fundamental shift takes place in a man. For me, I was reborn from a devilish bachelor into a man who now bore the responsibility of an innocent life. It completely turned around my life for the better. And so it is with Harry Bosch. It is the presence of his daughter that transforms him from Heironymous to Harry.Overall, I highly recommend this series."}, {"userName": "Scott Rhee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5717792-scott-rhee", "userReview": "There are certain genre writers who, within their given genres, transcend, through phenomenal writing and a deep understanding of the human condition, the formulaic structures and cliches of the run-of-the-mill horror story, science fiction epic, or murder mystery. Stephen King, Peter Straub, and Dan Simmons are examples in the horror genre. Ursula K. Le Guin, Harlan Ellison, and Neal Stephenson are examples in the sci-fi set. James Lee Burke, Elizabeth George, and Michael Connelly exemplify the best in mystery writing.Connelly, best-selling author of over 25 books, has been setting the bar pretty high in the mystery genre for almost three decades, and I have no idea why I have NEVER, until now, read a single book by him. Shame on me. I rectified that serious deficiency by picking up his first novel (written in '92), \"The Black Echo\", the first to introduce his beloved protagonist Heironymous \"Harry\" Bosch, an LAPD homicide detective who isn't afraid to shake things up in his city, department, and private life. Bosch is not a popular cop. He doesn't have friends. He doesn't date. And he's pissed so many people off over the years---criminals AND fellow cops---that he constantly has to look over his shoulder for the killers or the Internal Affairs officers out to get him. When he's not working, he's sitting at home, listening to his extensive jazz collection, drinking copious amounts of beer, and suffering from chronic insomnia. Needless to say, he works a lot. So, when he gets the call to check out a DB (dead body) at Mulholland Dam at an ungodly hour during a holiday weekend, he jumps at the chance. What starts out, though, as a seemingly simple \"dump-and-drive\" escalates into something more. The body is someone Bosch knows. Rather, knew, during the dark days of 'Nam, of which he is still suffering bouts of PTSD. During the war, Bosch and the vic were \"tunnel rats\", soldiers assigned to clearing out the underground caves of the Viet Cong, a particularly dangerous and terrifying job. Bosch quickly uncovers a vicious crew of bank thieves comprised of ex-Vietnam veterans, nearly all of them tunnel rats. Their target isn't money, however, but millions of dollars in diamonds brought over to this country by Vietnamese higher-ups protected by the U.S. government. Soon, Bosch not only has two unscrupulous IAD officers breathing down his neck (for a completely unrelated incident) but also agents of the FBI and the CIA are butting in with jurisdictional nonsense that are distracting everyone from the real investigation. On top of that, Harry soon suspects that someone within his own department is working with the bad guys. Most of these people wouldn't mind seeing him dead, for various reasons. Bosch doesn't give a shit, though, as long as they stay out of his way and let him do his fucking job. Fans of good mystery, suspense, and crime thrillers certainly won't be disappointed with Connelly. If you're like me, you may just find a new favorite author."}, {"userName": "Kate~Bibliophile Book Club", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9841866-kate-bibliophile-book-club", "userReview": "I\u2019ve decided to go back to the start of the Harry Bosch novels, created by Michael Connelly, as I missed out on a fair few over the years.

What he finds leads him to believe there is more at play than just a simple drug-related death.What startles Harry more though, is the fact that he recognises the dead body as someone he served with during the Vietnam War. A tunnel rat called Billy Meadows. Meadows used to run the tunnels and flush out anyone hiding in them, and these tunnels were dubbed the black echo.What follows, during the course of the investigation, is the uncovering of far more than just one death. Corruption, conspiracy and so much more take place in The Black Echo. I had forgotten how good Connelly is at creating such a strong plot.

It's his call, his job. But it turns out the man is someone Harry knows from his Vietnam days, another 'tunnel-rat,' or one of the soldiers who went into the tunnels to search out suspected snipers, or the Viet Cong. Going down into these tunnels was called going into the 'Black Echo,' hence the name of the story. But the story gets deeper, more complex, with links to a year-old bank robbery and shady goings-on when the last refugees and soldiers left Viet Nam in 1973. The story has all the feel of both the 70's - when Harry was young and a soldier - as well as '90's, when the story takes place. There are twists and turns, loyalty and betrayal, lots of action, and dialogue that feels and sounds real. Harry's a tough guy, no doubt about that, and his personality often gets him in trouble, so there's also a 'film noir' feel about it, even though this isn't a movie. I liked the fact he lives in one of those 'stilt houses,' or cantilever homes which stick out the sides of a canyon.
