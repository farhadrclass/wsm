I can't believe I found an author I like as much as Dee Henderson. AGAINST ALL ODDS has everything anyone who likes Christian/Romance/Suspense is looking for. When Evan \"Coop\" Cooper, a member of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, is assigned to protect Monica Callahan-a woman who doesn't want anyone interfering in her life-sparks fly. Those sparks ignite something deep inside Coop. But with Monica's safety on the line, he ignores his personal feelings even though he knows he is falling in love with Monica. Monica, estranged from her father, is angered that her world has been turned upside down. But when she realizes the threat against her life is for real, she relies on Coop to keep her safe. What she's not ready for is the way Coop has invaded every part of her world, including her heart.Irene Hannon has masterfully weaved a story filled with intriguing suspense and dramatic romance. Her characters are rich and warm, and the banter between them as they try to deny their feelings for each other is what keeps you turning page after page. AGAINST ALL ODDS will definitely be cataloged as one of my favorites."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah", "userReview": "Hmmm. I know I read this for the May challenge, but somehow I managed to not rate or review it. Horrors!Monica is a very spunky and memorable character. I love how she's determined not to let this rude interruption into her life ger her down or defeat her. She's a go-getter, even when she's in danger and feels terrible. I'm always drawn to a heroine with such a plucky attitude toward life and hardships.The Christian element of the story is also very well shared; both Monica and her fearless protector have some serious forgiveness issues from their childhoods, and Coop is drawn to her faith by the way he sees her struggle with her need to forgive her father.I've quickly decided that I love Irene Hannon's books, and this is one of the best of hers that I've read so far."}, {"userName": "Stefanie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64200589-stefanie", "userReview": "Irene Hannon is a wizard with suspense.

The Christian aspects are certainly present, but well-handled (even as a non-Christian reader, I didn't find them overbearing.) The romance, on the other hand, was rather heavy handed, though there was no sex. The main characters were constantly noticing how attractive the other was, and how they'd never felt like this about anyone before. Instant physical attraction and emotional bonds forming between people is something that really shakes my suspension of disbelief in a story -- I prefer to see relationships developing over the course of time, so I found that aspect rather jarring.The author has clearly done some research, though she still suffers from some errors like three million dollars cash fitting into a backpack (it would not) and referring to Afghanistan as part of the Middle East and Afghans as being of Middle Eastern descent (to be fair, there are definitions of the Greater Middle East that do include Afghanistan, but the typical eastern border of the region is Iran.) It would also have been nice to see an Afghan who _wasn't_ a terrorist as an actual character -- I believe there's exactly one of those in the book, and he's basically just a name. Combined with bad guys who are essentially cardboard cutouts who are there to be evil, it's probably for the best that there's not a single mention of Islam to be found.All in all, probably better for the romance fan who likes a little suspense mixed in."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11909124-staci", "userReview": "I've read several Irene Hannon novels written in the past few years.

Originally it was implied that this would have a place in the story but as a secondary storyline it had too much prominence. That one of the central characters was very religious made this aspect important \u2013 but as it bled into other aspects of the story it was a bit much. Secondly the romance portion was going steady \u2013 then switched gears \u2013 then wrapped up. I felt it was a little disjointed. What there was of the romance was good but it should have been more consistent. Finally the typesetting was off so that some sentences were duplicated or partially duplicated. The good things included the characters although not deeply drawn were likable, the overall plot & storyline were good but not necessarily strong. The complexity of Monica\u2019s character made her interesting but made Evan\u2019s character seem dull in contrast \u2013 however it also portrays some real couples"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5887927-sarah", "userReview": "I liked parts of this book but there were a few moments in it that weren't so great.

Terrorists holding citizens hostage were demanding things from him before the hostages would be released. Usually this goes unheeded, because giving in to terrorists' demands only means it works, and they will continue to use that tactic, creating even more terror. Callahan had to stick to this resolve, except now they are threatening to kill his daughter, Monica, who, unbeknownst to them, has been estranged from her father for many years. But he still loves her and sees to it a group of FBI agents are assembled to protect her. Coop and Mark are those FBI agents who have the task of informing her of life threatening danger, and to try to get her to a safe house. She is resistant because she's an author and has speaking engagements.But as things begin to happen even in her own house, she's left with no choice but to go to this safe house.This doesn't stop the terrorists from their plot to kidnap her and use her as another hostage. But Coop and Mark both have taken their job seriously and have even become fond of her. Their determination to save her knows no bounds.I liked this book a lot, and I don't believe I've ever been disappointed in anything Ms. Hannon has written. Great intrigue, surprising vulnerability in a man whose trained to be stoic and who needs a solitary life. Satisfying growing feelings between Monica and one of the agents.My only disappointment was how the romance wrapped up so easily, and how neatly the agent set aside his lifelong non-feelings about faith, and need for a solitary life. Yes, there was conflict discussed about it, but he changed too easily into a church-going sweet guy, when before he looked forward to weekends where he could go to bars, get drunk and pick up chicks. It just needed more development, in my humble opinion. But, that aside, it was really well done. The FBI tactics and terrorists involvement aspects were well researched and if I didn't know Ms. Hannon's life was far removed from this sort of life, I would have thought I was reading words from an expert."}, {"userName": "Patrice", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4681894-patrice", "userReview": "This is a story for our time. It deals with extremists and terrorists. Three Americans are taken hostage in Afghanistan and it\u2019s up to diplomat negotiator David Callahan to get them released. He\u2019s followed the United States\u2019 stance on not giving into to demands from hostage takers. Then in a twist, David is informed by the terrorists that should he not meet their demands, his daughter, Monica Callahan, would become a fourth hostage. More unfortunate is that he and his daughter have been estranged for the better part of 20 years. She wants nothing to do with him and won\u2019t take his calls. This leads to David Callahan to use everything at his disposal to protect his daughter.\tA directive from the White House to the FBI Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) is called in. Evan Cooper, \u201cCoop\u201d, and his partner, Mark Sanders, are brought in to handle the situation. This should be a relatively straight forward assignment, but there is nothing easy in dealing with Monica. She feels that her father is being over-dramatic and that it\u2019s\u201d too little, too late\u201d. She is a published author of self-help books and a professor at the local University in Washington D.C. She refuses to be intimidated by a threat from terrorists in the Middle East and wants the HRT to disrupt her life as little as possible. Coop is finding Ms. Callahan too much of a distraction and can\u2019t figure out what it is about this woman that has him thinking about things he has tried to keep buried in his past and making him question some of his choices in life.Then a very personal warning is left for her and she realizes how much danger she is really in. After that it takes all their know-how and the help of the local FBI officers to keep her safe. They follow all the standard procedures and know they are doing their best, but the terrorist kidnappers seem to be a step ahead of them at each turn. Will David Callahan give in to the terrorist demands? Will the HRT and Coop be able to keep Monica safe? What will happen to the hostages? Will Coop do anything about his new realizations about himself and what part Monica Callahan plays in them?"}, {"userName": "Dora Hiers", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5298284-dora-hiers", "userReview": "FBI Hostage Rescue Team Member Evan Cooper is content to work hard and party even harder, and with plenty of available, attractive women, he avoids commitments and emotional entanglements...until he's assigned to protect Monica Callahan. Monica's gentle prodding breaks down the barriers he's erected since his mother's death and father\u2019s subsequent emotional withdrawal.Estranged from her father after his abandonment to pursue his diplomatic ambitions, Monica overcame hurt and betrayal, earning a PhD in communications and forging a successful career. If she ever commits to a relationship, she intends it to be with a man who communicates well, someone who doesn't put his career first. Not Coop. But, she finds herself drawn to the quiet, determined-to-protect-her man. I like how Monica, a believer, struggles with the issue of forgiveness towards her absentee father. Considering forgiveness a tenet for Christianity, Coop doesn\u2019t understand, and calls her on it. She admits that\u2019s her biggest failing, and in doing so, opens the door for several conversations. I found her honesty refreshing and their discussions on faith realistic.Monica\u2019s father attempts to reconcile his moral principle of not negotiating with terrorists with his desire to save his daughter. He's never told his daughter he loves her, yet now she hears his unspoken message. I love how this unfolds during the story. Wow! With a fast paced, action-packed, nail-biting plot, you might be tempted to sail through this book in a few hours. But I'd recommend against that. This book is flavored with spiritual and moral issues, juicy nuggets I preferred to chew on for a few days. Although it lacks the physical intensity (um, more displays of affection) I generally prefer, Against All Odds more than compensates in emotional and spiritual depth as love and forgiveness transform Monica and Coop.

While I agree that the subject matter is similar, I strongly disagree that her writing style is similar. Unlike Henderson, Hannon repeatedly has the same character thinking the same basic thoughts over and over again when self-reflecting. I tend to read very fast, often reading a book in a day or two, so I don't need to be reminded that a character is thinking or feeling a certain way. One of the things that almost made me put the book down was the frequent head popping between Monica's point of view and Coop's with no line breaks (at least in the Kindle version) to prepare the reader for the shift. There were several scenes throughout the book that did this. I don't mind changing points of view in a scene, there just needs to be some warning - otherwise it throws me out of the story until I can make sure I didn't just totally misunderstand which character's point of view I just read. The overall story was okay. I liked the hint of romance. As far as suspense goes, I thought there were several instances where the suspense was diffused because the author gave too much away. For example, one of the bad guys is talking to another about how he found Monica where the FBI was certain no one could have found her. The bad guy gives it all away. I think it would have created much more tension to leave the reader in the dark until later in the story - let us wonder \"how did they do it?\". That's what I expect from suspense."}, {"userName": "Julie Graves", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74167-julie-graves", "userReview": "Monica and her father are estranged.

I wanted to see how everything worked out. I don't automatically dismiss a book because it's Christian-based fiction, but I don't seek them out either.The problem with this book is not so much the book itself as the public's perception of the hard-as-nails men of a Hostage Rescue Team and the violent terrorists who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. Men like these don't usually talk as nicely as the characters in this book.Although well plotted with a coherent story, the other problem I had was with that plotting. Without giving away some of the plot elements, I'll just say that some of the events were rather naively portrayed. I have a hard time believing that professionals were just so dense that they couldn't figure out certain things.All in all, Ms. Hannon had a difficult task to write a story like this without the profanity one would think characters portrayed therein would use as well as weaving the element of Christianity into the narrative. None of that is easy. Compelling characters and a compelling story enable one to suspend disbelief, or, at least, to suspend most of one's disbelief.I'd like to see Irene Hannon bring her talents to a more realistic telling of this kind of story."}, {"userName": "\u269c\ufe0fTrea", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5223520-trea", "userReview": "I'd been looking forward to this book for a while now.

The characters were easy to connect to and identify with, and the romance that grew between them was actually believable. The religious angle present in the story really wasn't preachy at all.

I thought it was a nice light read and I liked the characters. The characters felt real and I wanted them to win, instead of the bad guys, so I really appreciated that. I was worried we were going to get sympathetic with the enemy, which would have not worked at all for the book, so I'm glad she stuck to clear lines of good guys and bad guys. Also, I have a feeling that, if you're a fan of NCIS, you're probably going to be a fan of this book and the rest of the series.Also, before I get into my spoilers, which start after this paragraph, I am an agnostic. I did not mind the fact that this had a lot of faith in it. When I started reading, I didn't realize that it was going to have that. I got this as a free book off of Amazon back when I first got a Kindle and I just read synopsis back then of book covers I liked. I really liked the cover and then I liked the plot line. The fact that the faith is there but also in the background until you get to the end, where it is needed in my opinion due to Monica's background, was nice. I want to read more by her because of that and, in a way, not feeling like it was shoved in my face. It was a plot device and treated as such and not preaching to the reader in a breaking the 4th wall way.Ok, now spoilers.That said, this book was a bit on the predictable side when it came to the plot. This is a good and bad thing, because it played into the genre it is in, but you knew certain things were going to happen. The twist of Monica being kidnapped? Yep, that was going to happen. The predictable strand of one of the kidnappers wanting to use her for \"stress relief\" (which, EW). The big bad guy being double crossed because someone didn't agree with him and wanted to get away. The big wrapped up bow of the ending with a marriage proposal - which I did go \"awww\" and loved - but you saw it coming. With big glaring headlights. I think the only big shock was the dad being hit by the IED and then his death. I was hoping that we would get a big squishy make up with dad ending along with Monica and Coop getting engaged but, you know, not to be. It's the only reason that I'm only giving it four stars is because it was predictable.That all said, I want to read the next book in the series. We're going to have Mark as the main character, Coop's partner, and I hope we'll see Coop and Monica's wedding through the book. I kind of like the idea that we're going to hop over to another character instead of testing Monica and Coop's relationship through his job. It seems... well, Monica wouldn't stand for it. At all. It would be a really short book. So, yes, predictable. Is it going to stop me from reading more of her work? Nope!
