She is a piece of work like Joan Rivers; she is classy like a British Lady; she is like some uber-conscientious (not to mention less literal) S. King. She is prolific; her work thrills & entrances... she cares for her sentences like adorable puppies, and like adorable puppies she beats them sporadically into discipline, too. She is ruthless. She is flawless-- a Reader's Writer, through and through (which, any reader must attest, is an essential and absolute MUST).Marya has all the elements that made \"Blonde\" my favorite book this year... a woman's life is complex, despite fame, fortune, or brains bestowed upon her by higher forces. Marya comes from miserable beginnings and she suffers everlasting misogyny (and not just from men)--of course being meek, she evolves into the successful woman of letters we would imagine, yet still remains an intriguing introvert. And thank goodness we have Super(Writer)-Woman herself to give us access to such tortured & multidimensional souls."}, {"userName": "Ida", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/979751-ida", "userReview": "I gave it 3 stars based on Joyce Carol Oates' mastery of the English language and her ability to delve deeply into the complexities of human behavior. I found myself rooting for Marya throughout the first half of the story. However, Marya's academic life, particularly the period following her first couple of years in college, is pedantic, a real challenge to read. It took me 3 days to get through the final 100 pages! The sad part of this is that by the end of the book, I no longer empathized with this eccentric character. Oates successfully managed to turn off any positive feelings I still harbored. Too bad."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2111767-pat", "userReview": "Marya's life is described in chapters dealing with a traumatic childhood, religious observations, college experiences, a career in academia, and relationships. Throughout it all, the overwhelming feeling is one of loneliness and a life lived searching for a sense of belonging. The chapter dealing with thoughts on religion reminded me of Flannery O'Connor. The abrupt ending, although disconcerting, is probably intentional. I think this book is brilliantly written, and perhaps gives us more of an insight into JCO as a person than most of her fiction."}, {"userName": "Stacey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23705336-stacey", "userReview": "2.5 stars... I loved this book and I also hated it so I guess I liked it, sort of. The beginning captured my attention and I was hooked. The ending was also good. However, there were times that I was completely bored and skimmed over the words, almost quitting. Then it would get good again. I did love Marya though. I wanted her to escape her early life and was happy that she was so successful in the education and career. Her relationships with men drove me crazy, always married men. She was too smart for that and it bothered me but she was young I guess...By the end of this book, I really just wanted it to be over."}, {"userName": "Molly Ferguson", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/234905-molly-ferguson", "userReview": "This book is incredibly well written, as all of Joyce Carol Oates' books are. Marya is a very unique character whose life you become absorbed in. However, the book was profoundly depressing, and I spend my life reading depressing books so that's saying a lot. From the first to the last page, Marya's life is horrendous and everyone she loves dies or abuses her in some way. I read somewhere that there were a lot of autobiographical elements to this book, but I sure hope not for Oates' sake. A good book, but not a beach read."}, {"userName": "Jane Hammons", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2931363-jane-hammons", "userReview": "Years ago I used an excerpt from this novel (it was excerpted in a St. Martin's textbook) in a comp course I was teaching and was amazed by the layers of the story (when Marya is a student at Port Orskenay college). Students responded in complex ways to it as well. I heard Oates speak recently and was motivated to finally read the whole novel. For me the novel sags a bit in the \"academic\" section when Marya is a prof and the ending is abrupt in an unsettling way that I suspect is intentional. But overall I enjoyed it, and I think what it has to say about working class girls going to college is not only historically important but relevant, and perhaps, sadly, becoming even more relevant today."}, {"userName": "Esther Bos", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16299044-esther-bos", "userReview": "This is a novel in memoir style. I felt that I knew Marya, but couldn't quite like her or feel comfortable with her. Which is the kind of person she was! A dysfunctional early home life left it's mark on Marya's personality, but determination and her intellectual interests helped her make accomplishments in life that would not be predicted by those who knew her and her background.

These sections are well written and Marya is an easy person to connect with and feel empathy for.However, things started to go downhill after the halfway point when focus shifts to Marya\u2019s academic life.I found the pace of the novel changes from this point, becoming slow and long-winded to the point of tedium. The last 100 pages were a slog to get through.Unfortunately, Marya starts to change as well and I found my sympathy for her the trauma she experienced as a child gradually waning. She\u2019s just not a particularly nice person. She\u2019s eccentric as a child and this comes across as sweet. However, as an adult she is cold and prickly and very dislikeable. I appreciate what JCO tried to do with Marya: A Life and her prose is as great as ever but the book doesn\u2019t hold together."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102271-cynthia", "userReview": "I read this because it is one of Joyce Carol Oates' more personal novels. It has left me with a bit of a knot in my stomach."}, {"userName": "Francene Carroll", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6891396-francene-carroll", "userReview": "Marya's rise from humble beginnings to become a respected academic and writer is an interesting one and this had the potential to be a great book. What marred it for me was the detached style of writing and the slightly pretentious narrator who reflects the overly-cerebral and chilly character of Marya. For much of the time I felt like someone was telling me this story second hand rather than allowing me to experience it for myself.Marya's life is not an easy one and her traumatic childhood can account for many of her flaws, but her sense of superiority gets boring after a while. Maybe this was a protective shield she had to create to forge her own path but even at the end of the book she still believed that her Uncle who raised her surely had to love her more than his own daughter because she was smarter! She does come to realise that you can't escape from the past no matter how hard you try but just when it seems she might experience some real emotional growth, the story ends abruptly.I liked the way this book portrays the struggles of \"scholarship girls\" whose only outlet from a stifling life of poverty and conformity was through academia. It also shows just how insular and archaic the academic world can be. When Marya leaves this world behind (for reasons we're not privy to) to live in New York and write about human rights abuses in Latin America, there's still a distinct sense that nothing she does really makes much difference. I'm not sure if this was Oates' intention but there's something obscene to me about well-heeled journalists and academics who jet-set from one international conference to another making a very nice living off the suffering of others without doing anything to alleviate it.Another thing that bothered me was the lack of women in the book. All of the important people in Marya's life are brilliant, intellectual men. The only woman she has a significant friendship with is Imogene, who is portrayed as manipulative and fake. Her cousin Alice and the girls she goes to school with are simpletons and her Aunt is an insensitive cow. In an era when so many women were embracing feminism and challenging gender-roles, she doesn't come across a single female who is worth mentioning in detail apart from Imogene. It's only males she's inspired and influenced by so in the end this independent, intelligent and complex woman is defined largely by her relationships with men. Ironic really.I can't help comparing this book with Stoner by John Williams which is about a young man from dirt-poor beginnings who finds an outlet in academia, but who then struggles with faculty politics and his personal relationships in a rapidly changing world. I think Marya would have benefited from some of Stoner's rawness and honesty."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2341546-becky", "userReview": "I was pretty frustrated by Marya. The first couple of chapters deal with childhood, adolescence and religion, and I found Marya's quite deliberate obtuse nature pretty irritating. She grows into herself though, and by the time she made it to college I quite liked her. The naivete she displays as she enters an affair with her Professor is touching, and his loss is quite crushing. For me, this was the most magical part of the book - Marya growing into her career, in touch with her passion, riding the coat tails of this gent towards bigger and better things. But then it ends. Marya gets a job, hangs around with a douchebag fellow Professor, has another romance very similar to the Professor one, and ends up alone, isolated, strangely dependent on men she doesn't even seem to like that much. And that's when I realised that almost all of her story and behaviour is driven by men. Is that because of her childhood experiences? Are they her outlet for the pressure of her intellectualism? Is she just lonely? I couldn't really figure it out, and it drove me pretty mad."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36342791-paul", "userReview": "As always with JCO one is carried off on the flood of her writing from the first pages. Marya is an odd character though; obviously damaged by her early experiences one nevertheless feels this is the kind of person she would have grown into in any case. As such, although her story is fascinating, she\u2019s curiously unsympathetic - in fact one can well understand her Aunt Wilma\u2019s impatience with her. I had the feeling that by the last third of the book even JCO was losing enthusiasm for her! It\u2019s as though she\u2019s flicking through a photo album of her life, going faster all the time. Marya is said at one point never to have deeply loved anyone \u2013 perhaps that\u2019s why the male characters she has relationships with, Feinn, Gregory and Eric, never really come to life. The one person she encounters who\u2019s really convincing is the truly awful Imogene Skillman! Still, some wonderful passages though, including the vivid description of \u2018the reading experience\u2019 on pp 146-147; just not among my favourite JCO novels."}, {"userName": "Louisa Dell", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37233533-louisa-dell", "userReview": "Marya's life gives the book its title, and so one might expect a ordinary progression. But the reader being so close to the feelings of the heroine, the plot is less present than a succession of emotional paintings, which give all its splendor to this novel of initiation. Thus, the narration allows the reader not to judge the character, and is not that an important point, a proof of the writer's mastery ? Marya will takes part in my literary memories... La vie de Marya donne son titre au livre, et l'on pourrait donc s'attendre \u00e0 une progression banale.

To me, some of her more recent works have not been as good as some of her earlier works. I believe this book was written in the 1980s and to me it was Oates in her true style and form. I read reviews where many said they did not like Marya, they could not warm up to her character. To me, that was the point. Marya has issues, you are not really supposed to like her or feel sympathy for her. The issues are not stated outright, but the reader can definitely discern what they are! The only part I did not like was the ending. Even though I think I understood it, i.e. Marya trying to focus on her own likeness in her mother's photo, I thought the ending was rather abrupt."}, {"userName": "Phyllis Lautenschlaeger", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31931858-phyllis-lautenschlaeger", "userReview": "An intense, successful woman views her life.I chose this book because of the author. Years ago I read many of Joyce Carol Oates books and enjoyed them immensely. Today I find I am not looking for the same type of reading material. In this book she describes the life of a very intense girl growing into a woman. Her life proceeds in anecdotes more than living day by day. It's always as if she can make an interesting story to tell others then she is content for a moment. I would suggest this book for a real intellectual person.

I'm at the point in my life where I feel I am backed up in terms of reading I should do. I feel more and more guilty whenever I revisit something old.

It was very well written; Oates is, after all, a master at the writing craft. But I never came to care for the main character, Marya. Her childhood circumstances caused her to be an outsider in the home of her aunt and uncle. This type of situation usually causes me to root for the child navigating significant obstacles, but in this case, it did not. Whether this is because of something lacking in the book or my state of mind when I read it I cannot say. However, this will not deter me from reading more of her books.

There was one sentence, referring to Marya, that I thought described Joyce Carol Oates as a writer: \u201cShe wanted to convert human pain into human words, she wanted to convert the memory of intense emotion in the past into intense emotion in the present, and to be herself unmoved.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Tarah Luke", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31837430-tarah-luke", "userReview": "#1001books #707leftThere was much about Marya's character that reminded me of myself, even some of her experiences were like some that I have had.
