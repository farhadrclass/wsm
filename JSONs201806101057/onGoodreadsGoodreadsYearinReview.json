It seems like it was just last year at this time, when I said that I had read more than I had ever dreamed of. Never did I think that I would surpass that just one year later. In 2017, I undertook a personal Pulitzer challenge and read 20 books across all platforms and also only read books by women authors during International Women's History Month, and hope to continue with these next year. I have read novels and memoirs by favorite authors including Isabel Allende, Amy Tan, Anna Quindlen, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and discovered new favorite authors including Carson McCullers, Alice Hoffman, Colin McCann, and Julian Barnes. Some made my best of the year, and others enriched my reading experience even if they missed the cut as best of the best. I also took on co-moderating positions in goodreads groups the baseball book group and retro chapter chicks and stayed active in some old favorites including reading for pleasure and catching up on classics and much more. Each group and its members has contributed to my reading year, and I would not have nearly all of the suggestions I have without input from all my groups and all of my goodreads friends, whether they take the time to read and comment on each review I write or participate actively in groups or are just silent friends. Thank you all.From a personal standpoint, the Cubs did not repeat as World Series champions but I have been able to keep the memory current by watching videos and through the book The Cubs Way: The Zen of Building the Best Team in Baseball and Breaking the Curse, which I gave a special mention award to. The Patriots did manage to win the Super Bowl with an epic comeback, but I have been reliving their adventure through videos rather than books, at least for now. On a more personal level, my youngest daughter started first grade this year and is now reading chapter books with ease. I decided to include favorite books read by my kids this year because they all love to read, and they read a variety of quality books. My reading story of the year actually belongs to my seventh grade son. Recently, he completed I Don't Care if We Never Get Back: 30 Games in 30 Days on the Best Worst Baseball Road Trip Ever as an independent reading assignment. One of the book report choices was a fictional q and a with the author, but he took it one step further. I emailed the author Ben Blatt to see if he could answer my son's questions, and he was happy to participate, this after just publishing a new book and being involved in his own busy life. This memory will stay with my son long after he finishes school and I hope will contribute to all of my kids being lifelong lovers of reading.I wish everyone a wonderful rest of their reading year, an amazing 2018 reading year, and an enriching holiday season, whichever one you celebrate.

I finished my undergraduate degree, started a master\u2019s degree and undertook some freelance review work. It\u2019s been so much fun!\nSo here\u2019s my breakdown: \n-My top five:1. Siddhartha is beautiful and wise, one of the best pieces of fiction I have ever read. 2. Lolita employs such creative and artful language to describe some truly horrific things. 3. To Kill A Mockingbird made me cry and it made me laugh, such a powerful story. 4. The Long Earth is imaginative and vast. It made me think of all sorts of possibilities and even made me consider picking up a pen myself. 5. Murakami has wrote some fantastic books. I've not read enough of them. This year I got through five, next year I may do more! And my least favourite : 1. La Belle Sauvage was the most disappointing book released this year. 2. Animal farm I found to be rather boring and overrated. 3. Never Let me Go didn\u2019t deliver what it ought to have done. My ten book challenge was also a blast:1. A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgress2. Animal Farm by George Orwell3. Beloved by Toni Morrison 4. Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov5. Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami 6. The Road by Cormac McCarthy 7. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie8. Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal by Jeanette Winterson9. The Sellout by Paul Beatty 10. To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper LeeI'm looking forward to telling you all what next year's is going to be! :)Happy New year!"}, {"userName": "Mischenko", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1194517-mischenko", "userReview": "You can also see this at https://readrantrockandroll.com/2017/...This has been one incredible year of reading. Even though I joined Goodreads in 2008, I didn't remain active, and this year has been my first full/active year here. I've thoroughly enjoyed discussing reviews, learning about new authors and books, making new friends, and increasing my TBR up to 13,559!This year I started my own book blog which includes most of my book reviews and much more. I think this was a pretty good decision for me and I've made some wonderful blog friends and met some incredible authors too. I enjoy sharing my reviews here on Goodreads and in the blogging world. I also started the \"Meet The Reader\" series where I introduce some of my friends from Goodreads so that other people can discover them as readers and see their likes and dislikes. This year I've read 418 books after setting my challenge to 400. Honestly, a great number of those are children's books which makes the number seem insanely high! There's no way I could read that many full length books in one year! I may have missed a couple, but here are the book's that stand out for 2017.

After summer I did have less time to read due to a Master studies I started, which is taking up a lot of time next to my job but did manage 70 reads. This year, probably a bit less. But... the good part is, the studies are very challenging indeed and I do try to keep reading in between the study books. A big thank you to all dear friends I got to know here for the great and the lovely contacts, Goodreads truly is one of my top spots to be, such a lovely addiction! Like I did last year, I'll highlight my top reads for 2017! Here are my five star reads: \u2022\tAlias Grace by Margaret Atwood. What a writer! What a book! Impressive writing, intriguing story. \u2022\tThe Childfinder by Rene Denfeld. Again... what a writer! A great talent, proven in The Enchanted and again an impressive dark story. \u2022\tSpoonbenders by Daryl Gregory. Such a fun and weird book, I will follow this writer. \u2022\tSam Wyndham series 1 and 2 by Mukherjee, Abir. A great find, this writer and very atmospheric books. Looking forward to part 2 mid this year!\u2022\tDeath comes for the Archbishop by Willa Cather. Another author I got to know in 2017 and will definitely read more of Cather soon. Grand, beautiful book. \u2022\tBeartown by Fredrik Backman: much said about this book, many great reviews. Loved it. \u2022\tThe Chilbury Ladies' Choir, Jennifer Ryan: delightful and entertaining. \u2022\tThe Ambush, Donna Tartt, what a find, those short stories of Tartt I ran into. Usually she writes long long books but the short stories are equally disturbing and great!\u2022\tThe Summer before the war by Helen Simonson: one of my first reads of 2017 and a great next novel after Major Pettigrew. \u2022\tThe life we bury, Allen Eskens. Another great new author for me. Impressive dark story. Will definitely read more of this author this year. \u2022\tBlood Meridian, Cormac McCarthy. One of my favorite writers. Seriously bloody and impressive. \u2022\tDe tuinen van Dorr, Paul Biegel: What a delightful fantasy story by this famous Dutch writer. One of my audio books. And I have selected a few four star reads from the long list of really good 4-star reads:\u2022\tOracle night by Paul Auster. The master of unfollowable mystery. Great read. \u2022\tOne hundred poems from the Chinese by Kenneth Rexroth. Simply takes your breath away...\u2022\tGrave goods by Ariana Franklin. Great historic series. So sad she's no longer among us... \u2022\tThe last days of California, Mary Miller. Great debut read. \u2022\tLost in Translation: An Illustrated Compendium of Untranslatable Words. Such fun!!\u2022\tThe Unexpected Inheritance of Inspector Chopra: such a great new series with a baby elephant as assistant detective. \u2022\tThe trouble with goats and sheep by Joanna Cannon. Delightful, dark and fun. \u2022\tThe book of the unnamed midwife by Meg Elison. Dark and grim, but hopeful. \u2022\tShe rides shotgun, Jordan Harper. Again... dark and grim, but hopeful. \u2022\tTitaantjes, Nescio. A Dutch literary masterpiece. \u2022\tDesperation road, Michael Farris Smith. Again... dark, grim and hopeful. Great writer. \u2022\tTall Oaks, Chris Whitaker. Weird out of the box, great read!Well, I could go on, but I say, onwards and upwards in 2018 for many great reads! Happy reading!"}, {"userName": "softlykaz (on hiatus)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42130592-softlykaz-on-hiatus", "userReview": "2017 literally does not feel real at all. this is an alternate timeline and we've all been raised in the opposite universe and came to this one as innocent travelers!!! it's time we go back!!!on the bright side though, this time last year, I thought 'hibernate' was spelt 'hybernate'.... so really, there has been progress whichever way you look at it.with all seriousness, I wasn't planning to \"review\" 2017 at all but you know what? my life could go anywhere next year. like, I could go to prison and start my own drug ring or marry bill gates or just sit on this bed for the next 20 years and there is really just no way to know!!but also I've really wanted to share a bite sized piece of myself with you guys because I know a lot of you must've formed opinions on me based on my internet presence and that's completely valid because it's still an extention of who I am!! however, I think you should know that my online persona is just an incredibly exaggerated version of myself. I only speak in hyperbole and I sure do peddle every profitable aspect of my personality out for validation and the very attention I would hate to receive in real life lmaoso this is me, completely unedited. okay not completely but the closest thing to complete that I can manage. ya girl is trying to be mysterious!!!2017 was the year of many firsts. it was the year I graduated high school and moved out three weeks later for college in France and away from an abusive household. I've lived on my own for the first time, paid my own rent, did my grocery shopping, found out that laundry is truly a pain in the ass, slept through so many wake up alarms, took so many wrong buses, made genuine connections with so many people, had a crush on a pretty girl with dark matte lipstick & a denim jacket, cried sitting on the bathroom stall of my college, skipped classes to take a depression nap at 11pm, and wasn't too surprised to discover that the color of my skin and my native tongue are good enough for some ppl to define my worth.It was also the year of making my own choices. it was the year that I decided I'm going to drop out of medschool because I didn\u2019t want to be the Self the people in my life didn't work hard enough to become, and in the spirit of fulfilling the stereotypes laid out for me as a millennial, I'm going to take a gap semester to figure out what I actually wanna do without stressing out about school and grades and just. be. it was the year I begun to ascribe to the ideal that I don\u2019t owe anyone any sort of explanation on the things I do and the choices I make unless the situation has a direct negative impact on their lives. and for the first time ever, I had my own space to sort my own emotions out, to sift through the lumps of my personality and solidify my thoughts, to congeal my passions and hobbies and really understand my own boundaries and what\u2019s acceptable to me without the weight of someone else watching and judging my every move. 2017 was the year I let myself feel validated in my queerness. it's the year I realized that sexuality is a spectrum and labels are just the markers we put along it so it's easier to explain and define but I should define the label rather than have the label define me. I've learned that I don't need to be assigned who I can love and what it is that I can do or cater to the superfluous sort of binary in the way society thinks about gender. but more than anything, that human beings are amazing and love is an honor. and I am no longer interested in convincing people that how I feel and who I am is valid and as long as I know my truth and what works for me, that\u2019s what matters. 2017 was also the year I have come to know so many people here who have such a warm and kind presence that it genuinely brightens my entire day every time I see/talk to them. it really is a gentle reminder of all the lovely people that are out there waiting to be met someday. and it\u2019s what helps me keep going. I know I don't say this enough but I really appreciate everyone who takes the time out of their days to write me so many kind words on here. I am treasuring it all. more than you know.2017 was the year I've learned that the way people treat you is how they feel about you. that some \"friends\" only love themselves through you and will only use you as an audience when their thoughts and feelings are needed to be injected somewhere, with no regards to yours. And I have simply become tired of making efforts and excuses and investing emotional labor into friendships that are only based on consistency. it's also the year that taught me that it's 100% okay to let people go when they support things that I strongly disagree with, especially when their opinions attack a way of life that I participate in. people who have no issue encouraging systems and structures that continually oppress marginalized groups and who often speak from a position of privilege in that they aren\u2019t directly affected by these opinions. some relationships only stunt your personal growth and you need to let them go.2017 was overall a year of Lessons.I've learned that jealousy & passive aggressiveness are so toxic and cleansing myself should be top of my list.I've learned that just because I did something wrong in the past doesn\u2019t mean I can't advocate against it now and I shouldn't let people use my past actions to invalidate my current mindset. more importantly, I've learned that no matter how progressive I think I am, I will still be unlearning problematic behaviour my whole life.I'm still learning how to get outside more and exist in the real world for a while and stop getting pressed over trivial things that genuinely don\u2019t matter in the big picture that is life. I'm still learning how to stop glamorizing negativity and start promoting inward and outward kindness and self care and finding fulfillment in my own company. I\u2019m still learning how to be a good friend and how to contribute good things into the universe. I\u2019m still learning.but I think the greatest lesson this year has taught me is the ability to say \"I'm a brown queer Muslim woman\" without a shred of doubt or shame or hatred and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never take for granted.okay. I'm sorry, you probably didn't sign for all of this lmao fjghgh LETS JUST TALK ABOUT BOOKS NOW!!!! I might not have a girlfriend. or a boyfriend. but I've had a pretty decent year when it came to booksaccording to goodreads, I've read a total of 75 books this year and not to unmask a global conspiracy or anything but that sounds fake and made up and I AM OBJECTING. see, I know for a fact that I've read at least thrice that amount in FANFICTION!! it's not my fault goodreads can't get their shit together long enough to realize some fanfics are not even fanfics. they're classic literature and must get the recognition they deserve!! honestly I don't know where I would be as a person and in society without the ability to open up ao3 or scroll through tumblr for more fanfics/headcanons to inject into my bloodstream. shout out to all of you for sticking with me through my weird distant introvert/depression/anxiety mood swings!!! y'all are the real mvp\u2019s!!!also, I've reread so many of my favorite books this year and that was before this hideous hellsite figured out that reread option trick!!! so naturally, I'm going to blame it on goodreads (listen, 90% of my problems can be somehow traced to this website believe me)since I'm a human slug and thus can't afford the energy to write down every single book I've read this year (in this economy? no ma'am), I'll just leave my 2017 shelf here for y'all to stalk!!!listen I know I talk a lot of shit about goodreads. this website is really uniquely terrible in nearly every way but I'm very grateful it let me meet all of you wonderful human beings!! besides, where else am I gonna SCREAM about fictional people??? do I post that on facebook? do I email a relative?? NOanyway. may the universe be tender to all of you. be kind, always. support marginalized communities, always. and help protect and soothe the earth as much as you can. shout out to the version of you that y'all will become on december of next year.

I had a pretty good reading year! I\u2019m very happy with the 130 books that I read, and I feel like with each year I get better and better at picking out books, and requesting ARCs, that I am confident I will at least enjoy, therefore, my average rating tends to get higher and higher. \u27bd And thanks to the amazing Brock at Let's Read, here are some other statistics that I was able to gather from his amazing spreadsheet:And if you\u2019re interested, here is his spreadsheet for 2018! (File>make a copy for your use)\u27bdThese are the five books that were published this year that were a tier above the rest. These five blew my mind, and expectations, out of the water. I truly believe these five are perfect books in every single way. And I personally recommend them with my entire heart, body, and soul. #5.) \nThe Bear and the Nightingale (Winternight Trilogy #1) by Katherine Arden \n\n\n\u201cBefore the end, you will pluck snowdrops at midwinter, die by your own choosing, and weep for a nightingale.\u201d\n\nThis book taught me that girls can be anything they wish to be, no matter the expectations society, family, and everything else in this world puts on them. And to always surround yourself with people that accept you and believe in you. #4.) The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas \n\n\u201cThat's the problem. We let people say stuff, and they say it so much that it becomes okay to them and normal for us. What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?\u201d\n\nThis book taught the world that we want black stories, from black authors, with black casts, with black people on the covers\u2026 no matter how many old, racist, white dudes continue to get published. But this book taught me how much more work needs to be done, and how I need to do more to boost marginalized voices, and how the world needs to change and it can begin with me and our generation.#3.) Tyrant's Throne (Greatcoats #4) by Sebastien de Castell \n\n\u201cFrom nothing we become men and women who write poems and wage wars and conceive of futures both wondrous and terrifying.\u201d\n\nThis book taught me that found families with unconditional love is the most powerful force in any world. And that friendship can heal wounds you never thought would stop bleeding. And that your past will never define you, or hinder you, from being good and kind and ultimately becoming the person you want to be. #2.) The Stone Sky (The Broken Earth #3) by N.K. Jemisin \n\n\u201cBut for a society built on exploitation, there is no greater threat than having no one left to oppress.\u201d\n\nThis book taught me to never stop moving forward, to always speak up, and help marginalized voices that need to be heard. And that we don\u2019t get to choose how people love us. And how one voice can change the world. And that blood is only blood, and that we should spend our days with people who love us! And that we are always deserving of love. Always. No matter what. #1.) \nStrange the Dreamer (Strange the Dreamer #1) by Laini Taylor\n \n\n\u201cSarai was seventeen years old, a goddess and a girl. Half her blood was human, but it counted for nothing. She was blue. She was godspawn. She was anathema. She was young. She was lovely. She was afraid.\u201d\n\nThis book reminded me why I love reading, and that books are magical, healing vessels. This book taught me that everyone has the right to change their future, and that we will never be our parent\u2019s mistakes. And that we can rise up, and become so much more, and that all of our stories deserve to be told. And ultimately, you get to choose who is in your story. These books mean a lot to me, and I feel so very thankful, privileged, and blessed that I was able to read them all this year. These books have all changed who I am as a person, and I will carry, pass them down, and sing their praises for my entire life. Books like this render me speechless to be honest, but I hope I did a decent job letting you guys know how much they mean, and will continue to mean, to me. \u27bd And the rest of my favorite books published in 2017:\u2728The Language of Thorns: Midnight Tales and Dangerous Magic by Leigh Bardugo\u2728Down Among the Sticks and Bones (Wayward Children, #2) by Seanan McGuire\u2728Red Sister (Book of the Ancestor, #1) by Mark Lawrence\u2728Kings of the Wyld (The Band, #1) by Nicholas Eames\u2728Wild Beauty by Anna-Marie McLemore\u2728Skullsworn (Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne 0.5) by Brian Staveley\u2728Godsgrave (The Nevernight Chronicle, #2) by Jay Kristoff\u2728Oathbringer (The Stormlight Archive, #3) by Brandon Sanderson\u27bd But my favorite book that I read in 2017 happened to be a 2018 title: \u2694The Cruel Prince by Holly Black!\u27bd My Top Five Least Favorite Books Published in 2017:\ud83d\ude43 Into the Fire (Night Prince #4) by Jeaniene Frost\ud83d\ude43 Raven's Mark: (The Raven Queen's Harem #1) by Angel Lawson\ud83d\ude43 Blood Rose Rebellion (Blood Rose Rebellion #1) by Rosalyn Eves\ud83d\ude43 The Ghostwriter by Alessandra Torre\ud83d\ude43 Bad Habit (Bad Love #1) by Charleigh Rose\u27bd My Top 18 Most Anticipated Releases of 2018:\ud83c\udf1fThe Cruel Prince (The Folk of the Air #1) by Holly Black - January 2nd, 2018 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\ud83c\udf1fBeneath the Sugar Sky (Wayward Children #3) by Seanan McGuire - January 9th, 2018 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\ud83c\udf1fIron Gold (Red Rising Saga #4) by Pierce Brown - January 16th, 2018\ud83c\udf1fThe Armored Saint (The Sacred Throne #1) by Myke Cole - February 20th, 2018 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\ud83c\udf1fHeart of Iron by Ashley Poston - February 27th, 2018 (I have an ARC!)\ud83c\udf1fChildren of Blood and Bone (Legacy of Or\u00efsha #1) by Tomi Adeyemi - March 6th, 2018 (I have an ARC!)\ud83c\udf1fHigh Voltage (Fever #10) by Karen Marie Moning - March 6th, 2018\ud83c\udf1fThe Heart Forger (The Bone Witch #2) by Rin Chupeco - March 20th, 2018 (I have an ARC!)\ud83c\udf1fDread Nation by Justina Ireland - April 3rd, 2018 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\ud83c\udf1fCirce by Madeline Miller - April 10th, 2018\ud83c\udf1fThe Thief (Black Dagger Brotherhood #16) by J.R.

I love you all, but these people truly changed my life this year, and I just wanted to give them a special shout out and you should all follow them (if you\u2019re not) to start your 2018 off right!\ud83d\udc97 Paloma became like my best friend this year, and our Snapchat streak is getting pretty intense. She\u2019s beautiful, funny, my book twin, and gives me the best romance recommendations in the world.\ud83d\udc97 Destiny became not only a huge part of my reading life, because we buddy read like 50 ARCs together, but she became a staple in my real life, too, and I love her more than words. She\u2019s also brought me into her bookish community on FB and helped introduce me to so many wonderful people. I have no words to describe how much she has changed my life, but I truly think we will be friends for life. \ud83d\udc97 Elise was totally along for the ride with me and Destiny\u2019s buddy reads, too! She\u2019s my spider queen, my sapphic book recommender, my theater star, and I love her so much! \ud83d\udc97 Em is like becoming the biggest reviewer on Goodreads, so I hope she remembers me and my love for her when she\u2019s famous. Also, she\u2019s the number one person I go to when I gush over any book and we leave each other 100 messages back to back when we love a book, and she makes every book I read that she has already read 100 times better. \ud83d\udc97 Petrik completely buried himself inside my heart and my only wish is for him to move to the US immediately. Not only does he write the best reviews, read the best books, and shows me so much kindness, he also is one of the most talented people I\u2019ve ever met. \ud83d\udc97 Mary completely just blatantly stole my heart and I hope she relocates to Vegas soon so we can be wed. Mary has helped me with so many reviews this year, while also doing some amazing buddy reads with me. She\u2019s also the most beautiful person on Goodreads, but she\u2019s also passionate, and intelligent, and honestly goals in every single way. \ud83d\udc97 Jules was honestly my buddy reading queen in 2017. I read so many books with her, and she made each and every one so much better. Also, we bonded over Nevernight and Godsgrave and now she can never leave me and she must read just as much with me in 2018! I don\u2019t make the rules. \ud83d\udc97 Alexis is my newest book friend of 2017, but I\u2019m completely obsessed with her opinions and content and her BookTube channel. I feel like I\u2019ve known her way longer than I have, but I can\u2019t wait to get to know her even more in 2018. Also, she\u2019s adorable, funny, has amazing taste in everything, and is such a good kitty mom. \ud83d\udc97 Lilly is also a newer friend of mine this year, but I honestly can\u2019t picture blogging without her now. Also, me and her have like every book in common and if my 2018 isn\u2019t filled with buddy reads with her I\u2019m just going to cry the entire year away. \ud83d\udc97 Chelsea is a confirmed angel that I was able to meet this year in person and it was honestly one if the highlights of 2017 for me. Not only is she gorgeous; she\u2019s smart, funny, so kind, and is 100% my go-to for anything and everything Thriller!\ud83d\udc97 Sue completely makes Goodreads for me. She puts in more work than anyone else I know on this site, and is always so kind and giving. I couldn\u2019t possibly make a list without giving her a shout out, because she does so much, and I can\u2019t picture Goodreads without her. And thank you all for making my 2017 so great! I hope 2018 is filled with unconditional love and good health and happiness for you all! Oh, and a good book always! I\u2019m so very grateful for each and every one of you who gush over books with me and show me so much kindness and friendship. From every molecule of my body, thank you. \ud83d\udc96\u27bd My 2016 Reading Challenge\u27bd My 2015 Reading ChallengeBlog | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Youtube | Twitch"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Books have always been a safe haven and this year I have needed that solace more than ever. Gone, are the days of blissful complacency and I think my reading choices reflected my introspective mood and internal struggles.

There are few people in my life to whom I can gush about books that I love, complain about the ones that are just so so or the ones I could not finish, and few people who enlighten me with their perspectives on what they have read. What\u2019s with my friends and family who are not avid readers ? This makes me very thankful for my fellow book lovers on Goodreads. I\u2019m wishing all of you good health and happiness and a lot of good reads in 2018! 2017 was a fantastic year for my literary heart and soul and I owe more than a bit of gratitude to the authors I loved and the publishers who provided me with so many advanced copies . I'm always drawn to new releases, both by authors I\u2019ve enjoyed reading and by authors new to me and in the last two years my penchant for these new titles has taken precedence over the long list of titles on my kindle and the stack of books on my coffee table and bedroom floor . In 2018 , I\u2019m going to make more of an effort to read some of those if I can keep my fingers off the request buttons on NetGalley and Edelweiss. Good luck with that - right?There were so many books that moved me to joy, to tears, to the heartbreaking reckoning that a happy ending wasn\u2019t to be, and many times to a belief in the tenacity of the human spirit.

Happy New Year, folks!I hope you all got drunk and sloppy rung in the new year safely and responsibly.Before we get into some books goals I have for 2018, let's recap 2017 right quick, eh?2017 was an interesting year.Personally...professionally...and of course, reading and book-wise - for me at least.Stat-wise, according to goodreads, I read a total of 219 books, with an average 3.5 rating.Not bad.Not bad at all.In fact, all in all all, I feel pretty good about this year.As I said above, it has been interesting...and by that I mean, I had a lot going on in my personal life. Thus, I know I didn't do as many reviews as I have in years past. I also know I haven't been as active on here.But that's just life, and real life will always come first.I don't believe in forcing myself to review something I have nothing to say about.Or forcing myself to blog posts when I have nothing I want to share or talk about.Also, I experienced a defined shift in my reading tastes and interests this year.As I've said before, I have been a huge reader since I was nine years old.And since that time (I am now 35 years young, my friends), I have always been drawn mostly toward fantasy, paranormal and, of course, my beloved romance.If a book didn't have at least SOME kind of romance in it?Pfffft.This year though?I discovered HIGH fantasy...a newfound interest in historical fiction...and - thanks to book subscription boxes and a brief stint down the rabbit hole that is booktube - a renewed interest in YA fantasy and fiction.I also became very interested in minimalism and living a life with less stuff and less stress.Of course, being that is a process...I was able to curb my spending on clothing and shoes and other nonsense I used to waste money on......but I seemed to funnel some of that need to spend into buying more books.Don't believe me?Yeah...that's ridiculous.And no, this is not me humble-bragging about my mad sale/deal finding skills or saying \"look at how many books I have;\" this is me saying......the first step in battling an addiction is admitting you have an addiction...lolBecause what you DON'T see in that above picture?Is my OTHER TWO FULL bookcases which have hundreds more books in them.Which reminds me about my 2018 book goals, which I will get to in a second...First, let's recap my favorites of 2017.Favorite fiction discovery of the year...The amazing-ness that is Lauren Gilley. I saw a review for a book of hers a friend posted and decided to try it out...That book was,\n...and 11 books later, I can say with certainty that Ms. Gilley is now one of my favorite authors of all time. Seriously, if you haven't read her yet...do yourself a favor and get on it. Other books by her I loved this year:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Favorite high fantasy...\nHoly shit. Mind blown. Favorite romance reads...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavorite YA fiction read...\nThis didn't blow my mind or anything, but thought it was really cute and I thought the format was kinda cool. So consider this an honorable mention, I suppose. Favorite new series...I am hugely late to jump on this bandwagon, but whatever. \nEve and Roarke...swoon. Favorite nonfiction book...\nAs mentioned above, I became interested in minimalism this year...purging stuff I don't use/need/want...indulging in less consumerism...being more mindful of my purchases and my time. Except as applied to books, obviously...what can I say...I also discovered Book Outlet this year. #LateToThePartyAsUsualBut I know ya'll understand. I, at some point, will come back and link my reviews for these books on here...but right now, I am short on time.And lazy. Which brings me to my...\nMY BOOK GOALS FOR 2018\nNice segue, right? *snort*Anylame, off we go.1) READ ALL the books on the above pictured shelvesYes, I realize this is probably not going to happen. There are literally hundreds of books on there and on another shelf...But I'm gonna do my damndest to get it done.Cause it feels ridiculous to have so many unread books on my shelves.2) FINISH all of the series I have started and not completed.I have so many series I have read book one or all but the final book in...and it's driving me fucking nuts, you guys.Some of these include:The Mistborn seriesThe Grisha TrilogyThe Throne of Glass seriesThe Shatter Me series (I am currently reading book one)The Harry Potter series...yes, I JUST read book one for the first time year, and yes, you are reading this correctly.3) Read at least ONE classic book a month.If you couldn't see in that picture up there...I have a whole shelf of classics...and more on one of the non-pictured shelves. All of them I have either not read or read so long ago that I want to re-read them as a quasi-mature adult, namely my all time favorite, Paradise Lost, which I haven't read since my sophomore year in college.4) Utilize my LIBRARY more often.I have a legit AWESOME library system where I live.Seriously, they usually have every book I go looking for, either in physical form or via ebook, and so there is just NO reason for me to waste money on books I'm not sure about not make better use of it.I did manage to read the first quarter of the JD Robb In Death series via the library, but there are some other books and series I definitely should have checked out from the library instead of purchasing because I ended up not loving them.If I DO end up loving something and just HAVE to have it (because I'm a greedy and privileged little child) - I will just go buy it AFTER I make sure I love it AND WILL RE-READ it. I did this with the ACOTAR series and plan to read it again this year before book four comes out.Which I already pre-ordered. Because EXCEPTIONS.Now. All that said.I'm not going to be a Nazi about any of these rules.Reading is my main source of fun and entertainment - so I'm not going to force myself to do anything that might make it feel NOT fun.Plus, I work really hard for my money.So, at the end of the day, if I wanna blow it all on books, fuck it.Imma do it.But there you have it, folks.My list of \"resolutions\" that I already - on the first day of the new year, no less - said I probably won't stick too."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "2017 IN FICTION : THE GOOD STUFFI ploughed through a number of why-haven\u2019t-I-already-read-this? books \u2013 the three by H G Wells turned out to be short, sharp and shocking - The War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man and The Island of Doctor Moreau.  You don\u2019t read these things because you think you already know the stories well enough but when you do get round to it you find they\u2019re so much weirder and crazier and funnier than you had any right to expect, so those three are RECOMMENDED. The Strange Case of Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde was in the same category, but curiously Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  (aka Blade Runner) was actually less weird than I was expecting. It seemed Dick was just dicking around. It coulda bin a contender but it was like one of those party balloons you stick a pin in and it just goes phsssssssss instead of bang. Oops, I\u2019m supposed to be discussing the good stuff here. Okay \u2013 They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?  was a) a great title, b) a great movie and b) a great bitter blast of rage against the machine. Family Life by Akhil Sharma was horrible horrible horrible in a good way, a bleak view of what a meaningless accident can do to destroy a person and his family. Giovanni\u2019s Room by James Baldwin \u2013 well, I expected to feel I kind of had to like that one, it\u2019s a known stone classic, but I was actually knocked out by it \u2013 recommended! The North Water by Ian Maguire was a Booker 2016 short lister which was great stuff if you like your stuff nasty and brutal; Train to Pakistan by Khushwant Singh was also really nasty and brutal \u2013 er, I think I\u2019m seeing a corroboration of my Theory of Novels here.You see, my theory is that novels exist merely to catalogue the number of ways humans can be unpleasant to each other. Simple! I read three fine long American novels about what modern life is like, all recommended : A Book of American Martyrs by Joyce Carol Oates (in which an abortion doctor is murdered by a Christian evangelical); We are Not Ourselves by Mathew Thomas (in which a father suffers from Alzheimers); and You Don\u2019t have to Live Like This by Benjamin Markovits (in which hipster white guys try to recolonise the deserted parts of Detroit). I love big novels which try to get their arms round big modern problems \u2013 like Fourth of July Creek by Wayne Henderson which was my best book of 2015. If there are more like this, please let me know. THE BAD STUFFThis year I continued to be really bad at choosing novels to read, 14 of them I rated 2 stars and seven a whole 1 star, and the only 5 star read the whole year was a reread, Titus Groan by Mervyn Peake. I really must get better at this game \u2013 I enjoy writing a nice amusingly bitter review of the bad ones, but I\u2019d much prefer to read actually good books instead. I abandoned in HORROR eight novels this year \u2013 notably -Tropic of Cancer by Henry what\u2019s his name \u2013 ugh, some people still think that because this book got banned by the anti-sex uptight puritan establishment and then later by the anti-sex uptight feminist establishment it must be a rock n rolling blast of beautiful joyful abandoned liberated comic genius whereas it\u2019s actually bile-filled misogynistic claptrap.Here I Am by Jonathan Saffron Fooey \u2013 I thought he\u2019d have got rid of his sickeningly twee children in Extremely Noisy and Permanently in your Face which I also abandoned, but no, they\u2019re here again, so no more Saffron Fooey for me.I finished three one star abominations, two because they provided me with many unintended yelps of astonished laughter. Let\u2019s hear it forThe Thirty Nine Steps by John Buchan, or as it might have been called 003 \u00beThe Carpetbaggers by Harold Robbins, one of those experiences where I was so far outside my comfort zone I needed breathing apparatus. As I reported in my review, never have I read a novel where so many beautiful women enjoyed being naked so much. In a strange way, it was a lot less misogynistic than Tropic of Cancer . Also way way way funnier. There were ho-hum novels along the way of course, the most ho-hummiest being Stoner , that much praised novel by John Williams who as well as composing the soundtrack to Jaws and Star Wars and a zillion other movies wrote this apparently moving story of a humdrum English professor back in 1965, when it was deeply ignored. But now everybody loves Stoner! Yay! Except me! Boo. WHAT ELSEBritish journo Gary Younge wrote Another Day in the Death of America : A Chronicle of Ten Short Lives , in which he took one random day and examined all the deaths by gunfire of young people in America on that day. Very moving and appalling, and my non fiction book of the year. I also kept unearthing excellent biographies, this year of H P Lovecraft (In the Mountains of Madness), and Diane Arbus : Portrait of a Photographer and Katherine Mansfield : A Secret Life. Nothing like reading about other people\u2019s real life unhappiness. AUTHORS OF THE YEARHas to be Kathleen Rooney and Stephen Jarvis \u2013 when I trashed their novels Lilian Boxfish Takes a Walk and Death and Mr Pickwick they both voted for my review \u2013 you got to give them credit for that \u2013 and Stephen actually convinced me to give his (enormous) novel another go. And I will do so!*PS - I forgot to say thanks to everybody for all your comments on my reviews through the year. They always cheer me up."}, {"userName": "Nayra.Hassan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44531801-nayra-hassan", "userReview": "\u0648

this past year have I really dedicated myself to becoming an active participant of this site. I'm not sure why I waited, because this year has defined me as a reader in more ways than one. First, I've started writing reviews. It's interesting to look at how my writing as progressed throughout the year. Second, I've read and responded to a lot of my friend's reviews. That singular action has honed my ability to write reviews. So, for that..thank you, to all my friends! I have also participated in buddy reads, which is such a wonderful experience. Overall, this has been an amazing year in terms of reading. I've read many winners and some not so much.. Here are my favorites of the year (in no particular order):Note: Not all of these books were published in 2017.. I'm also including books that I read and really enjoyed in 2017.The Good Daughter by Karin SlaughterThe Life She Was Given by Ellen Marie WisemanThe Identicals by Elin HilderbrandThe Secrets She Keeps by Michael RobothamBehind Closed Doors by B.A. ParisThe Orphan's Tale by Pam JenoffThe Mother's Promise by Sally HepworthAn Untamed State by Roxane GayNineteen Minutes by Jodi PicoultWe Were the Lucky Ones by Georgia HunterA House Without Windows by Nadia HashimiPerfect Match by Jodi Picoult"}, {"userName": "Berit\u2600\ufe0f\u2728Traveling Sister\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38946743-berit-traveling-sister", "userReview": "2017 receives five fabulous stars from me!!! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f Goodreads is such a wonderful community!

I meet new friends and I had thought provoking conversations with my older ones. I grew my book knowledge thanks to my presence here and I am thankful for all the meaningful time I spent on this platform. However, this year was less impressive in reading terms. I made some poor choices and they were due to GR as well. Inspired by other friends, I followed some rewards and forced myself to read books that were not for me. I also jumped into some books because other friends swore by them only to realize that they weren't for me. I also discovered some incredible good reads that I wouldn't had touched without encouragement. The Unseen would be the best example in this respect. Without further ado, here is my TOP 10 of 2017:1. The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin 2. The Unseen by Roy Jacobsen ; review 3. The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood4. The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro5. The Silkworm by Robert Galbraith6.

Calling this reading year memorable, I would do so if only for Franz Kafka\u2019s Letters to Milena. Reading these letters, from which Kafka emerges not solely as an anxious and restless insomniac man on the edge but as well as a witty, loving and playful human being bestowing his epistolary companion with endearing tenderness and affection, was an overwhelming experience. I got entirely lost in the fulgurant intensity of the letters, the brilliant beauty of the sentences, their unexpected lyricism and tenderness, the sensuous and horrifying poetry of certain fragments. Reading the letters to Milena, together with coming across Maurice Blanchot (De idylle, The Madness of the Day) put me back on track of reading Kafka\u2019s stories (In the Penal Colony, The Judgement). A dear, wise friend inspired me to read more poetry again, and I was mesmerised by a few bilingual collections, namely by the French surrealist Paul \u00c9luard (Wereld met ogen van sneeuw), by Paul Verlaine (Het zal een zomerdag vol zonlicht zijn) and W.H. Auden (Tell Me the Truth about Love). I was amazed by a collection of love poems by Raymond Carver (Het woord liefde), who I only knew and read as a short story writer \u2013 honest and powerful, suggestive poetry. Further I was enthralled by poetry by Anna Akhmatova, Emily Dickinson, Gerrit Kouwenaar, Toon Telleghen and Piet Paaltjens (how remarkable fresh and funny his Snikken en Grimlachjes still is!) and I loved the way the Dutch po\u00e8te maudit Menno Wigman catapulted me back into the delight of decadent nights of youthful urban decay coming home weary from the Christmas family parties. The five collections by Wyslawa Zymborska I have read, left me somewhat with mixed feelings, however I liked the humour and philosophical playfulness of her poetry. Most tugging at the heartstrings (as painfully close to the bone) was the poetry collection Undying: A Love Story novelist Michel Faber wrote to commemorate and deal with the loss of his wife \u2013 an intimate and deeply courageous and moving recount on his thoughts and feelings regarding her long illness, death and the aftermath. Voicing what seems ineffable, he inspired me with awe and gratefulness, as did other books on bereavement, Roland Barthes\u2019s Mourning Diary, Julian Barnes\u2019s Levels of Life, Jens Christian Gr\u00f8ndahl\u2019s Often I Am Happy - in their diversity all in a sense helpful. As is yoga. The most rewarding read in the book club this year was a rediscovery, a Flemish classic, Willem Elsschot and his Villa des Roses, but the most animated discussion we had concerned Ian McEwan\u2019s Sweet tooth, which I found in a way deeply and disturbingly misogynistic. The genre of the graphic novel still strongly appeals to me, particularly the biographical ones, like Guillaume Sorel\u2019s The Last Days of Stefan Zweig and Salva Rubio\u2019s Monet:Itinerant of Light. Other graphic novels that resonated with me, emotionally and/or aesthetically were Wrinkles (Paco Roca), Irmina (Barbara Yelin), Het zotte geweld (Joris Vermassen) and the gut-wrenching Les Cahiers russes (la guerre oubli\u00e9e du Caucase) by Igort. Other highlights were T.S. Elliot, Fallada, Austen, Zweig, Fontane, Hesse, D\u00fcrrenmatt, Dickens. With working through the \u2018Perlouses\u2019 series (20 slender volumes distilled from French literature), I spent quite some time in France, mostly enjoying the diversity of the authors presented in this series (Balzac, Voltaire, Kundera (on Francis Bacon), Robert Pinget, Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost, Jean Echenoz (Plan of Occupancy), Pierre Michon, Diderot, Stendhal, Yves Pag\u00e8s, Marguerite Duras, Yasmina Reza (Dans la luge d'Arthur Schopenhauer), Alain Fleischer. Marquis De Sade (Augustine de Villeblanche of Liefdes list), Vivant Denon). Of these stood out for me Marcelle Sauveagot(Commentary), Zola (Comme on meurt) and Madame de la Fayette\u2019s La Comtesse de Tende. The latter lady, having me curious on Jansenism, pointed me to Richard Wilkinson\u2019s biography on Louis XIV I had intended reading for a long time \u2013 a captivating book of which I learned a lot despite not exactly liking the jesting tone of the writing. As to non-fiction the year started grandiose with Andrew Graham-Dixon\u2019s biography on Caravaggio (Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane), one of my favourite painters, and a book on the pioneers in photography (Freddy Langer, Icons of Photography: The 19th Century). I thoroughly enjoyed a short biography on one of my favourite composers, Brahms, and a very brief one on Pushkin (by Robert Chandler). What at first seemed a promising travelogue in the footsteps of Dostoevsky turned out rather disappointing in the somewhat awkward repetitiveness of the author\u2019s (however interesting) premise to parallel Dostoevsky\u2019s ideas to the current regime\u2019s (Peter d\u2019Hamecourt, In het spoor van de Russische ziel). The centennial of the Russian Revolution inspired me to read Lenin on the train by Catherine Merridale, Historically Inevitable?: Turning Points of the Russian Revolution (edited by tony Brenton) and Victor Sebestyen\u2019s huge and engrossing biography on Lenin - which in a way all both completed and challenged each other.I have started dipping my toes into philosophical waters by reading a great introduction by David Palmer, Looking at Philosophy: The Unbearable Heaviness of Philosophy Made Lighter, also finding much food for thought in the Wat blijft (by Patricia de Martelaere) and with Kris pint (De wilde tuin van de verbeelding), at the moment continuing slowly with Bertrand Russell\u2019s  A History of Western Philosophy. Growing more and more fidgety halfway the year not having much time to read because of the rush at home and at work, I engaged into a few collections of short stories, first reading them from cover to cover \u2013 having great encounters with Katherine Mansfield (In a German Pension: 13 Stories), Thomas Bernhard (Op de boomgrens) and Richard Yates (Eleven Kinds of Loneliness). When restlessness increased I found myself gradually singling out novella\u2019s or short pieces by favourite authors, as a substitute for a pat on the back whenever I thought I deserved so, for finally filling in that tax form or simply getting the family dinner on the table every evening (Pushkin (Queen of spades, unfinished short pieces, fairy-tales), some short stories by Dostoevsky, (The Christmas Tree and the Wedding), hazarding further into Poe, Baudelaire (The Generous Gambler), Woolf (A Haunted House), and quite some short stories and novella\u2019s I found online, via the project Gutenberg or in the New Yorker. Feeling that with this turning into an almost daily routine instead of calming down I am on the way on developing another addiction next to sipping too much coffee, I will abstain from on line reading next year, and if reading short stories, stick to the ones safely glued in books. Reading Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, a re-telling of the Odyssey for children (Michael De Cock, De lange weg naar huis) and Aesop\u2019s fables this year has enthused me to attempt further straying from my usual inclination to stick to 19th \u2013 mid-20th century authors. Thanks to Kris 2018 will be marked by reading Homer and hopefully some other books related to Ancient Greece/Rome. In the second half of the year I hope to be able again to involve into a few more voluminous reads \u2013 having quite some tempting recommendations from friends waiting (David Grossman, Tim Parks, Javier Mar\u00edas, Hemker, Verbogt - l\u2019embarras du choix!) as well as other bricks on the shelf one cannot smuggle unnoticed in the handbag (George Eliot, Thomas Mann).Many, many thanks to all of you, for your warmth, for your friendship and support, for sharing your love for books, and for so generously writing such tempting, inspirational and perceptive reviews here. Wish everyone of you a blissful 2018, may it be another year filled with joy, love and exquisite and juicy books.

In addition to meeting so many new friends and keeping up with my established GR friends, I also spent a great deal of time in Discworld, so much so that my passport was inked over and I got a tax notice from Lord Vetinari.It was my plan to read all of the Discworld novels and many of the short works and companion books and I did \u2013 so a very special shout out to Terry Pratchett and his wonderful creation.I also spent a great deal of time with Stephen King and am still enjoying reading his exceptional canon. Along with King, I am also binge reading the fine works of John D. MacDonald and am very much enjoying not only his Travis McGee books, but am realizing what a phenomenal writer he is overall.I awarded FOUR 5 star ratings this year, so here\u2019s a shout out for those outstanding works:The Dispossessed by Ursula K. LeGuin. This was already on my all-time favorite list and so this 2017 read was a return visit. I liked this even more this time around and I\u2019ll likely reread again.The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini. I was blown away by this superb work and recommend to all. I will read more from this author.Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke. I had read this in HS, decades before GR, and so this was a reread. I recall liking it, but from this older perspective I saw how truly brilliant was this book, influential and innovative.News of the World by Paulette Jiles. This quiet and unassuming poetic prose was a pleasant surprise and thoroughly enjoyable. A lesson to all readers that you just never know where you\u2019ll find your next 5 star reading experience.According to GR 2017 review, I read over 130 books with over 45,000 pages and I enjoyed them all \u2013 NO 2 or 1 stars this time around. Here are some honorable mentions:Peter Pan \u2013 a MUST read for all speculative fiction fans.Fritz Leiber\u2019s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories \u2013 excellent sword and sorcery fiction.A Monster Calls \u2013 wonderful YA book, but have your tissue ready, it almost made me tear up!Neil Gaimen\u2019s Norse Mythology.Rhett C. Bruno\u2019s science fiction.F. Paul Wilson\u2019s Repairman Jack stories. I\u2019ll read these all at some point.A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles, I\u2019ll definitely read more from Mr. Towles.Fredrik Backman\u2019s Bear Town and A Man Called Ove \u2013 I\u2019ll be reading more from this writer.So another great year has come and gone and the good news is that there are still MILLIONS of books to explore and share. To all my Goodreads friends:Sl\u00e1inte mhaith!"}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "2017 was a busier year than usual for me. I went to Maine, lost my dog of 17 years, and gained a wife and a cat. Thus I didn't read nearly as many books as I would have liked during quieter years.However, I like to think the overall quality was much higher than in previous years. I was a little more selective and a lot less willing to push through things I wasn't enjoying. Reading is for pleasure, after all, not self-torture.While I already compiled my 2017 Dantastic Book Awards, here are some highlights.1. I finally saw the light and devoured most all of the books of Laird Barron.2. The Elephant Who Liked To Smash Small Cars was finally reprinted.3. I read more than my share of neo-Lovecraftian fiction. Winter Tide, The Night Ocean, The Final Reconciliation, and After the End of the World were the creme of the crop.4. I tore through most of Hunter Shea's creature features.5. While the demise of DarkFuse was a shame, I took full advantage of the discounted ebooks. The Winter Box, Corpse Rider, and Fairy Lights were all more than worth what I paid for them.6. With the rise of ebooks, novellas are back! The following novellas are highly recommended: The Tea Master and the Detective, River of Teeth, Revolver, and Just Add Water.7. I did a fair amount of rereading, mostly books I initially read in the dreamlike time before Goodreads. I'm happy to say Hyperion, The Talisman, and The Handmaid's Tale all stood the test of time.8. Other Books I enjoyed in 2017 - The Sound of Broken Ribs, Lost Boy: The True Story of Captain Hook, The Last Place You Look, The Dunfield Terror, Fungoid, and Tampa.Addendums:1. Another milestone - I started wearing reading glasses2. The Far Empty was superb3. I should have included Mrs. Caliban in my list of books I enjoyed."}, {"userName": "Kevin Kelsey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey", "userReview": "edit: I just finished Timothy Snyder's On Tyranny, and had to include it in my list for the year. It's very, very good. The last few years I've been tracking my reading not only on Goodreads, but through a Google Sheets doc I designed to generate some highly detailed stats, graphs, etc for nerds: It's available here.This year I was a lot more selective about finishing the books that I started. Really, I was a lot more selective in general. I bailed on 10+ books about halfway through because they just weren't holding my interest, or because it wasn't the right time to read them, etc. I never rate/review books that I haven't finished, because I don't think I deserve an opinion on something if it isn't informed, and it's not informed unless I've completed the book.Unless I read something ridiculously good in the next couple weeks, here are my top ten 2017 reads broken into Fiction/Non-Fiction:Fiction:Superabundance, by Heinz HelleThe Resurrection of Joan Ashby, by Cherise WolasGrowth, by AJ SmithThe Intuitionist, by Colson WhiteheadUniversal Harvester, by John DarnielleA Visit from the Goon Squad, by Jennifer EganLittle Sister, by Barbara GowdyVoid Star, by Zachary MasonThe Dark Dark, by Samantha HuntDune, by Frank HerbertNon-Fiction:On Tyranny, by Timothy SnyderEthics in the Real World, by Peter SingerMy Struggle: Book 5, by Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rdThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, by Mark MansonReality Hunger, by David ShieldsThe Devil\u2019s Dictionary, by Ambrose BierceThe Cruft of Fiction, by David LetzlerMan of the Year, by Lou CoveInformation Doesn\u2019t Want to be Free, by Cory DoctorowWe Did Porn, by Zak Smith"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa", "userReview": "Well, 2017!You've been a roller coaster of a year for sure, hilarious, nauseating, up and down, fast speed, confusing, - and you leave me somewhat disoriented and shaky on my legs. Best reading experience of the year? Well, there is a lot to choose from, but I have to say that the adventure of reading all of Henry Green's novels over summer was a blast:LovingParty GoingLivingBlindnessBackCaughtDotingConcludingNothingThe other reading marathon that stands out is the Dostoevsky tour de force:Notes from UndergroundCrime and PunishmentThe IdiotDevilsThe Brothers KaramazovApart from that concentration on specific authors, I have had a blast reading some of my favourite authors again, most notably Heinrich B\u00f6ll:The ClownThe Lost Honor of Katharina BlumGroup Portrait with LadyThe Safety NetAs for classics, I finished two Roman epics:MetamorphosesThe Aeneid... and some plays by Shakespeare that I hadn't read before:The Winter's TaleThe Taming of the ShrewI discovered Nella Larsen and Colleen McCullers, and was pleased to see these fine authors' work being directly catapulted into my favourite shelf:PassingQuicksandThe Heart Is a Lonely HunterMany of my old favourite dystopian novels were reread with the scary realisation that they have turned into realistic fiction by now:1984Brave New WorldFahrenheit 451The Handmaid's TaleNever Let Me GoIt has been a year of angry reading as well, of frustration with a world gone blind to historical mistakes, and in this context, Christa Wolf's Kindheitsmuster touched me more than any other book, showing how fascist indoctrination works even in a regular, loving childhood home in a decent small town.The reading list for 2017 will of course not be completed before I have finished my December Dickens 2017, but I actually cheated a bit mid-year and squeezed in Martin Chuzzlewit, Dickens' perfect rendering of the American (un)spirit. And of course, 2017 finally is also the year I managed not only to start The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, but also to finish it. A truly amazing fact, considering how many years it stood untouched on my shelf, waiting for me to stop digressing.What will the future bring? Wishes for 2018? A bit less of the dystopian reality, maybe, and a bit more time for reading and discussing books.
