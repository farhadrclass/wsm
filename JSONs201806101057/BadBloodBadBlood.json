Cancer patient Trick inadvertently poisons a vampire trying to feed on him because of his blood. When the vamp takes it out on his friends, Trick decides to turn the tables and try to fight back. With the assistance of Goth Stripper Lolly and hunter Jonas Vale, the fight against the vampires is brought to the fore again.This book goes some surprising places - it's not a fun/funny/action-oriented vampire story, a la Buffy. It delves into some dark places, and our protagonists are not traditional heroes. Lolly's back story is especially rough, and it informs not only the characters but their route in trying to find the vampires. Jonas Vale sets the story on a more traditional path, but even he plays some tricks, and the finale is very powerful and plays out a bit surprisingly. The art is also darkly gorgeous, with moody imagery brought to shadowy life with water color work that serves to give a sense of desaturation even while it sports strong colors. It's just as surprising in its effectiveness as the story itself."}, {"userName": "Kirsty", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76596-kirsty", "userReview": "Vampires are one of those subjects that make me not want to read a book. But this was actually an interesting take on a potentially stale idea, and I really enjoyed it. The end was GRIM though \u2013 don't read this if you want angsty romance vampires."}, {"userName": "Bernie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8132647-bernie", "userReview": "I never tire of Jonathan Maberry's work. He always finds a way to put a new spin on a genre--in this case, it's the vampire genre. (If you're into zombies, then check out his other books.) This graphic novel has a fresh and interesting story line featuring an ill, young man named Trick, who tasks himself with the burden of fighting vampires. He seeks the truth about vampires when one threatens his life and the lives of those he loves; however, he only knows vampire folklore and Hollywood's interpretation of vampires so he's not sure how to go about locating them or killing them. His journey in seeking the truth is a page-turner and you will not want to put this graphic novel down. My only issue with this book is the type of illustration that was used. The drawings appear as though they're still in their rough stages and overall, it's very dark in terms of both mood and colour. Having said that, perhaps the illustrations are meant to be a reflection of Trick's sickness and the darkness he is forced to face inside and outside of his body."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3150152-jennifer", "userReview": "yes! next issue stat!Merged review:loved the twist on what the vamps do when staked.... ewwwww & awesomeMerged review:read #5 as well, but it's not listed yet on GR. the whole series.... so twisted! what an ending! loved it! lots of social commentary and pop culture digs in the series! loved it! sad it was so short!Merged review:Awesome!

Definitely NOT the vampire I'm used to reading/liking (much more demon-like/horror). Quite a lot of blood, pretty serious/depressing vibe, and definitely mature content. I'm just not really a fan of the artwork..."}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83180-craig", "userReview": "This is a very nicely written and illustrated vampire story. It's a self-contained (no, Ledger does not cameo) story with a pleasingly different take on the vampire mythology. The characters are different than your standard heroes, with flaws and failings that make them realistic yet still likable. The ending was particularly poignant and surprising."}, {"userName": "Sonic", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1823662-sonic", "userReview": "Didn't expect much from Jonathan Maberry.
