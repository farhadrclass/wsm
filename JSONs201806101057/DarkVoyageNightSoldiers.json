This novel took a while to gather momentum but it really picked up pace during the second half of the novel.This is somewhat different to the other novels that I've read by the author. There is still the bleakness and \"murkiness\" but the majority of the novel takes place on board the Noordenham which I really enjoyed. Love sea faring themed novels. Especially enjoyed the secondary characters here, the motley crew of the gallant Noordenham."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed", "userReview": "In my mind Furst writes the finest espionage novels available. I like his stuff better than LeCarre's.This particular story follows the travails of a Dutch Cargo ship that ends up running undercover missions for the British in early 1941.Furst's ability to describe the atmosphere of those times is astounding. He draws Captain DeHaan in such realistic terms that I only wish I could meet the man. The entire story gives us a peek into the past that is realistic, accurate, enticing, and absorbing. I wish I knew how he does it.As with most Alan Furst stories the ending is ambiguous so we can draw our own conclusions as to what happened to the characters.I can hardly wait to get to my next Furst novel."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15012065-anna", "userReview": "This is a really fascinating book for an adventure thriller. The majority of the story takes place on the decks of the merchant ship Noordendam which belongs to a Dutch firm. The ship is commandeered by a British agent for a short mission. Afterwards, the captain pragmatically agrees to an even longer, more dangerous and unknown mission -- to masquerade as the Spanish ship Santa Rosa in order to sail under its neutral flag. With that action, he realizes that he and his crew were drawn into the shadowy dark side of the war with no guarantees of support or even success.What especially makes this story fascinating is the pace. With that, Furst captures life aboard this ship -- technically in wartime, without a home port -- seemingly meandering first around the Mediterranean, then the Atlantic, the Baltic with vignettes of scenes on board and the crewmen punctuated with actions ashore and on board. He captures the essence of the shadowy figures that inhabited the dark side -- from the spymasters, to the agents, to the people one meets on shore -- never quite sure that they were who they said they were or even if you would see them again.With seemingly little happening, but with so much \"quiet\" action, the tension is the current that propels the story.Great stuff!"}, {"userName": "John Caviglia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10326280-john-caviglia", "userReview": "So far two Fursts, one finished, one but started. First impressions.... His covers tend to darkness, his titles to \"noir\" ... the overarching series being Night Warriors. It comes as no surprise that Dark Voyage is ... well ... \"noir.\" And Furst revels in his dark element. The prose is wonderfully nuanced, precise and crisp (Note to self: occasionally replace a comma with a period. For tight effect). His characters are such as live the complex life of \"noir,\" where (World War II in northern Europe, in this case) no responsible human decision is black or white, so that\u2014contrarywise (morally speaking)\u2014\"noir\" connotes but endless foggy shades of gray. \"Noir\" is nothing if not atmosphere. And Furst beautifully captures the historical moment to its last molecular detail. Bad weather is also a must. So it is fitting that the main character\u2014a Dutch sea captain ensnared by nets of espionage\u2014take his rust bucket crewed by a more than motley crew, spies and commandos as passengers, into the indeed very weather beaten Baltic, on a doomed mission to do his small part to stop the Nazis.... (Question to self: Did Melville, and his \"drizzly November in my soul,\" create seagoing \"noir?\") Very much enjoyed this excursion into darkness. And a tip of the hat to Don, for steering me to Furst."}, {"userName": "Lars Guthrie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie", "userReview": "Still good, but maybe my diet has been too heavily weighed toward Furst's spy thrillers recently. The formula is formulaic, even if it is a good formula.'Dark Voyage' differs from Furst's other World War II espionage novels I've read so far in that there is an absence of eastern European intrigue. Somehow a merchant seaman from the Netherlands doesn't quite have the pizzazz of other Furst protagonists. Captain Eric DeHaan is a stolid burgher type and the attempts to spice up his love life are misbegotten. That said, 'Dark Voyage' features some great nail-biting sequences as DeHaan's tramp steamer is enlisted by the British, shifts in and out of disguise sailing as a counterfeit Spanish freighter, and wends its way out of the Mediterranean and and through German mine fields in the North Sea. Furst really makes you aware of the scope and geography of World War II, with a rich sense of the history before it."}, {"userName": "Marc  A.", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1016435-marc-a", "userReview": "Another winner by Alan Furst. I haven't had this much enjoyment from historical fiction since Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey and Maturin series. If Furst can turn as many good volumes as he did (and he's well on his way), I'll be in heaven. I've often wondered what my father's (born in Poland in 1909) life was really like when the world around him went mad. Furst brings the WWII period as it looked to many ordinary (and some extaordinary) Europeans to life with great stories, peopled by beutifully realized characters with great empathy and wit. Most of the books don't (or just barely) even mention the U.S. ( which, I think, is generally what I've been exposed to when it comes to books and films on this period). Furst brings a whole new perspective to events that shook - and forever changed - the world."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12839674-james", "userReview": "Maybe this is my favorite Furst novel because it was my first, or maybe because it's so different from his others (which I also love) in that instead of alleyways, hotel rooms, train cars, and secret cafes, the main action takes place on a freight ship pulled into the war first under the guise of espionage and later by direct conflict. Rather than a single man against the world, this book has more of an \"Us versus Them\" feel to it with a ship symbolic of the allied powers facing Nazi Germany, including Polish engineers, Dutch sailors, seamen and soldiers from Spain, Greece, even Germany, a radioman from Egypt, a Jewish doctor, secreted passengers from Russia and beyond. I love how so many characters are given special little spotlights throughout. This book is almost more nautical adventure during WWII than espionage, but there are enough of each to keep a reader happy. Most of all, this one always felt fun to me, while others had the potential to fall into melancholy, despair, and loneliness, the crew in this book always had each other even in their most desperate moments. I'm sure I'll re-read this one every few years."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard", "userReview": "This is the eighth volume in Furst's \"Night Soldiers\" series, although most of the series need not be read in the order published: only The World at Night and Red Gold relate directly as a sequential pair.

I've come to think of him as the anti-Bond--his protagonists have very ordinary lives, and show spy craft as a project that is alternately terrifying and boring. One of the most nail biting moments in this book comes when the captain of the tramp freighter sees an untethered mine adrift in the ocean, and, because he can do nothing to maneuver to avoid it, has to simply watch it slide slowly by his ship. The paragraph while he walks the length of his deck, with one anxious eye on a floating mine 30 feet off the port side, is typical of the quietly suspenseful turns Furst often peppers throughout his books. One of the things that makes this book stand out from his others is that it somehow seems in this book that I came away with a better understanding of the sweep of the war at that time (the summer of 1941). Very often, Furst's characters are focused on quotidian fights that are important to a particular city or a very restricted place. In this book, the Dutch tramp steamer has been commandeered as a clandestine war vessel, and she ranges along the coast of west Africa, through the straits of Gibraltar and all the way to the eastern Mediterranean, then up the west coast of England and around the northern tip of Scotland and into the eastern Baltic. Consequently, I felt like I came away with a better sense of how the politics of those nations and places were related in that particular phase of the war. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Jim Thompson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41513429-jim-thompson", "userReview": "Furst has always been consistently excellent. Each new novel is an instant by in hardcover for me.A formula? Every major author has one: style, location, time, character types. Le Carre has his style - even darker than Furst. Place - LondonParis is his primary focus along with Warsaw in the early books in the series. There are a few characters who appear, disappear, then reappear for us to see them in a different light.Dark Voyage is unlike the others. It is not set in Paris. The characters are not upper middle class and nobility. There are far fewer professional spies at sea. This novel focuses upon one major character who has been termed by another reviewer: a king in his mini-kingdom. He is a king who commands, orders, and if he is good earns the respect of his crew. And, just as much as he is lord of the manor, De Haan is responsible for the safety of his crew.I like all Furst's novels and 'roll' in the atmosphere and time-period detail. He takes me back to my visits to Paris and other places in Western Europe (though I haven't been to Bratislava). His fogs are the real things, his women alluring and seductive, the bullet hole in the brassiere wonderful, and his food and drink satiate the palette and add pounds to my waist-line.In Dark Voyage Furst achieves an ending which may be difficult to top. But in the meantime, Mr. Furst, more please."}, {"userName": "Sarah Sammis", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122647-sarah-sammis", "userReview": "Dark Voyage was my introduction to Alan Furst's WWII spy novels. The book follows the ad hock crew of the Noordendam, sailing for the Royal Navy under a stolen Spanish flag. While the crew sails from port to port, we are given hints at the battles through letters, radio transmissions and their brief ports of call.Furst's writing style is reminiscent of Grahame Green, especially when writing for Carol Reed. I was most reminded of Our Man in Havana and The Third Man.The middle section, \"Ports of Call\" is written in a diary format. Each entry is headed with the coordinates of the ship and her itinerary. It is the most information heavy of the entire book, focusing more on the machinations of the various warring nations and less on the characters aboard the the Noordendam. History buffs will enjoy the chapter but I found my attention wandering at times.Save for the one dry chapter, I enjoyed Dark Voyage enough to jump into another Alan Furst novel, Kingdom of Shadows."}, {"userName": "Neil", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10278283-neil", "userReview": "This is book \u21168 in the \"Night Soldiers\" series. There are 2 main 'characters' in this book, first we have Captain Eric DeHaan. He is a Dutch sea captain in charge of a merchant vessel during the early stages of WWII. The other principal character in his ship, Noodenham, which sometimes becomes a double of a neutral Spanish freighter the 'Santa Rosa'. The reasons for this subterfuge become all too apparent as the story unfolds.Even though this book doesn't focus on a European city, in the lead up to, and during WWII, there is still the same atmosphere, and noir feel, as can be found in the rest of the books in the series. With much of the story based on board the ship, there is still plenty to capture the imagination of the reader. It reads more like a wartime thriller than an espionage novel.

Every book Furst writes appears to grow from the same thesis, but stretch into entirely new areas. This was a nice deviation from his normal East European or Parisian locals. With every Furst novel, I become more and more amazed at the nuance of his novels. He seems content to write his novels in the periphery of history. His characters float past major events like mouches volantes through the dark vision of history. He wants to tell the story of minor characters, minor battles, minor countries that together all made a major difference in WWII."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily", "userReview": "The most economical of Furst's novels that I've read so far, and also the only one in which the main action takes place after the outbreak of the war. This book deals with a Dutch merchant marine steamship that is coopted, willingly enough, to help in the English war effort in the spring/summer of 1941. The captain, De Haan, is like the king and protector of his own floating mini-state--which is a new theme, since most Furst books deal with lone-wolf characters. As usual, the novel is highly atmospheric, full of sounds and scents.
