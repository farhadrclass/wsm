Full of exciting adventures! Enticing illustrations! World maps and regional maps where you can follow John's progress! Alternating story forms! Regional maps are presented with numbers and numbered caption boxes to show Smith's movements. Longer stories are then presented that fill out certain adventures. An additional plus is that the book includes both Smith's travels through Europe (exposing readers to the politics, wars, slavery and modes of transportation) as well as Smith's New World adventures. In the epilogue, the author notes that stories are told from John Smith's perspective and indicates that others involved may have told the story differently. She also gives information on validation of John Smith's account by other contributors to the historical record.After reading this book at a friend's house, I purchased one for our home school and it is a hit with little boy explorers! I am reading it aloud now, but in a few years, I can see little boys choosing to read it multiple times themselves. High recommended."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2434990-sally", "userReview": "History of John Smith, including his adventures before Jametown.He was lowborn.The author addresses that the book is written from John Smith's point of view. \"All stories --even nonfiction ones -- are told from someone's point of view.\"Some people believe the stories he wrote were exaggerated or 'embroidered' (a common practice at the time). His accounts do match the writings of others. It is believed that Jamestown would not have survived without John Smith. \"He was a great leader: touch, honest, brave, practical, and fair. He respected the Indians and never tried to destroy them the way so many Europeans did. He worked hard and would go to any length to be sure that everyone had enough to eat.\"I love the spreads with the map and dated panels, hope to use this format as a wiring presentation."}, {"userName": "Faith Hough", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5561412-faith-hough", "userReview": "You know a book about history is a success when you try to read your five- and three-year-old daughters \"Angelina Ballerina\" and they say, \"Ohhh! Can't we read John Smith instead??\"The text and illustrations are excellently researched while being exciting and accessible for young readers. And even I was surprised by how adventure-packed John Smith's life was. I've been telling several adult friends things like, \"Hey, did you know that John Smith got captured by pirates/sold as a slave to the Turks/thrown off a ship by pious, panicked Catholics who thought God was cursing them for harboring an English protestant/etc/etc/etc?\" Yeah. Seriously. Cool story."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily", "userReview": "This book is packed full of facts about Jamestown, John Smith, Native Americans, and European history in the 1600s. Ms. Schanzer compresses an astounding amount of information into this book with a flair for story-telling that focuses on the action and bright illustrations that provide incredible historical detail. This book has maps, illustrated timelines, and little-known stories, as well as a bibliography for further reading and a thorough index. A great way to introduce young readers to a pivotal figure in early American history.For more book reviews, come visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."}, {"userName": "Briony", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2536381-briony", "userReview": "This book is jam packed full of information. While the book would be helpful for someone who is researching John Smith, I found the book overwhelming at times. I enjoyed the illustrations and well-researched methodology, but the switching from the tiny print in the graphic format to normal text, annoyed me at times. I also became impatient after John Smith's fourth escape. I can understand the appeal of the book, but it did not float my boat."}, {"userName": "Cortnei Brown", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47409513-cortnei-brown", "userReview": "'John Smith Escapes Again\" tells the story of a man that was once born in Olde England in the year of 1850 that went through many \"great escapes\".

I'd rather give it 3 1/2 stars. Although I understand the pictures were well researched, I still think some kids might find them hurtful (the Turk in particular). Also referring to Pocahontas as pretty... it was an unnecessary adjective and debatable accuracy."}, {"userName": "Ami", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2281833-ami", "userReview": "I love Rosalyn Schanzer's work.

Many readers will know John Smith as the man rescued from death by Pocahontas, but Smith's story included a series of fantastic episodes: escape from imprisonment, ambush by Indians, attacks by ruthless sea pirates, and more escapades than seem possible in one life. Now, just in time for the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, author Rosalyn Schanzer recounts the full details of John Smith's eventful life in her engaging storytelling style, complemented with a series of entertaining illustrations. Smith's role as the president of the pioneering colony of Jamestown is well known to schoolchildren. Schanzer's compelling narrative adds the perspective of Smith's English background to his better known adventures in America. Readers are given a complete portrait of the intrepid explorer and adventurer, of the fighter whose battling spirit always prevailed, and of the writer whose work was to shape the idea of the American Dream. Smith's story is punctuated by several impossibly daring escapes. His final escape left us with the rich legacy of his life story: through his writings, he escaped the fate of dying unknown. He returned to England as a poor man with a rich trove of memories, spending his final years writing the popular books that defined colonial America in tales of excitement and courage.", "title": "John Smith Escapes Again!", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41854.John_Smith_Escapes_Again_", "average": 3.98, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320446015l/41854.jpg", "reviews": 14, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23568.Rosalyn_Schanzer", "name": "Rosalyn Schanzer"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41854.John_Smith_Escapes_Again_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7074382-john-smith-escapes-again", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11532961-witches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207983.George_vs_George", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58475.How_Ben_Franklin_Stole_the_Lightning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503907.How_We_Crossed_the_West", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6263228-what-darwin-saw"]}
