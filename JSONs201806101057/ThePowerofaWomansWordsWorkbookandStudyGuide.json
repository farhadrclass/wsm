Some I've liked more than others, but I think I struggled with this one more than most (which is unfortunate because it's a topic that I was really looking forward to studying with my mom and sisters this summer).From a formatting perspective, there are issues with spacing. Questions that required thought out answers sometimes had only one line of space while questions that required one to two word answers got three or four spaces.In terms of the chapters themselves - they're long. Really long. Some of them had up to 30 multi-part questions with quite lengthy scripture readings. A number of the more recent studies I've done have divided study questions into days - which is something I think should have been done with this study to make it less overwhelming.Admittedly, we only had 8 weeks to do this study and there are 14 chapters, which meant that most of the time, we were doing 2 chapters a week. That's just too much work. This study really needs to be done in a minimum of 10 weeks, preferably 12 if you plan on using the workbook.Repetition was also an issue - both within the same question and throughout the study. Multiple questions required the reader to look up 4-6 scriptures and write an answer each time. The only problem was that 2-3 of the scriptures inevitably had the same answer so you're basically writing the same exact thing multiple times. The same scriptures were also used repeatedly throughout the study (gold ring in a pig's snout anyone?) to answer different questions.Some of the questions had obvious answers and others asked the reader to compare things that had no clear connection. I also thought some of the scriptural examples used were questionable - as if the author was having to stretch to make her point.Bottom line: the companion book for this study isn't horrible, but I would steer clear of the workbook."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5880552-samantha", "userReview": "Overall, I liked this workbook, but if frequently didn't seem like it really went with the reading in the book. There are a lot of questions and verses to look up for each chapter. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, we could not go through all of the questions in our groups time (about 1.5 hours), so we had to pick and choose which ones we would discuss. I really liked the book better on it's own though this workbook will give you more to think about concerning our words and how we use them."}, {"userName": "Leigh Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/863579-leigh-ann", "userReview": "I decided to do the workbook along with the book on my own and boy am I glad I did. The book touches the major topics but the workbook really gets to the heart of Scripture and gives examples from the Bible of people who struggled with these same issues. The workbook does have long assignments, but well worth it!"}, {"userName": "Terri Hardy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2648098-terri-hardy", "userReview": "Used this in conjunction with the book of the same name at our last Bible Study. Alot of work but well worth it. This study guide delves deeply into women and men of the Bible to see how their words affected their world and ultimately ours. The lessons are so well assembled that you can do this workbook without reading the book and still get a huge amount of information and insight."}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213272-courtney", "userReview": "The workbook doesn't seem to have much to do with the specific reading other than the general topic under discussion/study.
