I'm trying to be objective, to take off my rose-colored glasses and view the work through someone else's eyes, someone who's not a hardcore fanboy, but goodness gracious, it's difficult.Giving it the old college try, let me begin with the negative then... The Mauritius Command does not hold the passion of the first three books in Patrick O'Brian 20 volume seafaring series set during the Napoleonic Wars. Love and its numerous forms, many of which appear in O'Brian's writing, is not a theme as strongly attended to as it was in the previous books. Sure, trace whiffs of it linger about in the form of our hero Captain Jack Aubrey's longing for his wife so many thousands of miles away, but love is not a motivating factor as much here. Fear of failure, not living up to the \"manly\" expectations of the day, and the burden of command, these are driving forces that move the characters through this well-crafted tale.Certainly Jack and his ship's surgeon/intelligence agent friend Stephen Maturin are still solidly ensconced as our main characters, remaining as the heart and soul through out the series, however minor characters and their needs take hold of the narrative with just as firm a grip. Jack's need to succeed in his first chance to lead a squadron of ships is severely tested by his ability to handle personalities. These are not just chess pieces to be moved about and sacrificed with utter disregard. These are people, some quite prickly, and the somewhat ham-fisted Captain Aubrey must get the most out of them with a kind of delicacy that does not come naturally. This is fiction, but fiction based to such an extreme degree upon actual occurrences that one could almost call it a non-fiction. For me, that's fantastic, because I'm \"truth is stranger than fiction\" kind of person. However, following the facts too closely can have an ill effect upon historical fiction, especially if it takes the wind of the sails of a ripping good yarn. Be warned, there's a touch of that within The Mauritius Command. Regardless, this is another brilliant piece in O'Brian's masterful puzzle. As ever, his writing is superb, his characterization flawless, the flashes of action and adventure are fun and exciting. Setting descriptions of places the author has never seen are breathtaking. When I read these books I feel as if I've stepped into these exotic locations with Jack and Stephen, who have become so real to me as to be thought of as old friends.My review of book three, HMS Surprisehttp://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...My review of book five, Desolation Islandhttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."}, {"userName": "Felicity", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26729-felicity", "userReview": "I do enter upon my rereadings of Patrick O'Brian books with an open mind. I am willing to give fewer than five stars to each book before I read it. However, at some point, sweeping down upon the blaggardly French under a great press of sail, foreboding the ruin of a tragically flawed officer, or smiling at Aubrey's sweet simplicity, it becomes impossible not to give it every star at my command.Mauritius Command is a particularly cohesive volume, more united in purpose than most, comprising as it does one fictionalized campaign of the Napoleonic Wars. An intimidating military and political undertaking, requiring Maturin's cunning, Aubrey's nautical genius, and something in which Aubrey has never been tested: facility for high command.Note upon rereading: O'Brian's dry humor has some of its purest moments of expression in this volume."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "A delight as usual to dive into this 4th in the wonderfully addictive series about the British navy during the Napoleanic Wars. I gave myself the treat of coming back to this, which stands out as one of the best in the set of 16 that I read most of the distant past. Half or more of the pleasure comes from partaking in the special friendship between boyish and brave Captain Jack Aubrey and the more intellectual surgeon and spy, Stephen Maturin. The other reward lies in O\u2019Brian\u2019s portrayal of the special community that exists among the sailors aboard these floating extensions of the British empire. Of course, the quest of taking virtuous naval action against the forces of Bonaparte\u2019s tyranny is part of the hedonic equation, a chance to experience a more adult version of the heroic adventure tales of Hornblower that sustained my youth. Here Aubrey has the mission to take a small squadron to face the marauding French frigates which are devastating the trade of England with India around Cape Horn. The series of engagements covered in this tale involve a wonderful chess match of shifting odds which recapitulate the actual history of how the islands of Mauritius and Reunion off the east African coast were wrested from the French in 1805. Unlike the cat and mouse play between individual ships and commanders in previous books in the series, this one puts Jack in the position of leader of a campaign. As a commodore, his challenge is to harness and inspire his captains, each with a different set of strengths and weaknesses. He also has to coordinate with British army forces and local militia and judiciously risk Stephen to on intelligence gathering trips ashore. Much of the narrative comes from Stephen\u2019s reflections, which provides a fascinating perspective on the manners and morals of the time, critical views on British imperialism, and much comparing and contrasting of Aubrey with other officers. As usual, he is frustrated in his hunger to satisfy his naturalist avocation in exploring the flora and fauna of this remote geography. Still, we get to share his ecstasies over experiencing his first aardvark and manatee. His ruminations on human nature and medicine provide a satisfying backdrop to the story. And, as usual, the interludes of music and of humorous banter with Jack are icing on the cake. For example, at one point Stephen asks Jack whether he can learn anything useful from distant observation of the French ships:\u201cOf course,\u201d said Jack a little impatiently. \u201cWhat a fellow you are, Stephen. Any sailor can tell a great deal from the way another sailor sets his jib, or goes about, or flashes out his stuns\u2019ls, just as you can tell a great deal about a doctor from the way he whipped off a leg.\u201d\u201cAlways this whipping off of a leg. It is my belief that for you people the whole noble art of medicine is summed up in the whipping off of a leg. \u2026\u201d"}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"You cannot blame the bull because the frog burst: the bull has no comprehension of the affair\"- Patrick O'Brian, The Mauritius CommandThis is my fourth Aubrey/Maturin novel (obviously) and I have yet to read one that I wasn't completely in love with. There is just too much to love about O'Brian's writing: his knowledge, his wit, his humor, his details, his affection for all his characters, his various digressions. Some of my favorites in this book:- Dr. Maturin's discussion with Mr. Farquhar and Mr. Prote on the poetics of law- Dr. Maturin and William McAdam's discussions about medicine and mermaids (Manatees and dugongs)- Commodore Aubrey and Dr. Maturin's discussions about his temporary assignment as Commodore.- Food- Dr. Maturin the Naturalist's pursuit of eggs, drawings of aardvarks, etc.- Dr. Maturin's thoughts on Aubrey's character, surveyed against Captain Corbett, Lord Clonfert, Captain Pym, etc.- Dr. Maturin's addiction to Laudanum compared with McAdam's issue with alcohol. - Commodore Aubrey's explanations of figures of speech in the Navy (e.g. the devil)- the general horror of war, even triumph, shown by Dr. MaturinMany of the best lines and best observations are made by Dr. Maturin, which is by design. It isn't that Captain/Commodore Aubrey is without wit, intelligence, or even genius, but he is a man of action. The brilliance of the design of these books is with these two you get the action and the observer. It isn't that simple and often O'Brian will reverse the roles or combine the two for perspective, but it still is a useful structure for a long narrative. This novel came out in 1977 and I'm still convinced that there was some deeply secret relationship between Patrick O'Brian and Gene Roddenberry. It might be the universe delivering a weird twin, but there is something similar in the way these stories seem to fit the mood and temperature of Star Trek. I even get a Captain Kirk vibe from Jack Aubrey and a Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy vibe from Stephen Maturin (with a bit of Spock thrown in as well). Since the first M&C book came out in 1969 and Star Trek first came out in 1966, it is a hard sell to say that one really influenced the other, but both were being created over the same time. Anyway, I love thinking there is some secret back and forth between these two pioneers of 20th-Century maritime fiction."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[9/10]Still the best nautical adventure I've read in years, although this volume is slightly diferrent than the first three books. The change comes from a shift in focus from the developing friendship between Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, including their romantic entanglements on shore, to a greater portion of the book dedicated to actual naval battles. Until now the plot was basically Jack climbing slowly the ladder of command in the Navy, receiving a new ship, forging a battle-ready crew and engaging in one or two battles with the French or Spanish adversaries. In the Mauritius mission, Jack Aubrey is temporarily advanced to the rank of squadron admiral and sent to take away from the French their bases in the Indian Ocean (the islands of Reunion and Mauritius, used to send raiders to plunder the rich commercial vessels returning from India). So Jack has less time to work on his own crew, and must coordinate the actions of several ships at once, playing to the strengths of each subordinate captain and trying to compensate for their weaknesses. The mission is swinging from early success to almost catastrophic failure due to factors out of Jack Aubrey direct control, offering to the reader more than the usual share of bloody ship to ship broadside carnage. What I found astounding in the lecture is how close the author kept to the historical events of the attack on the islands, as described in a wikipedia article I found. The characterization is excellent, as usual for O'Brian, and I am also getting more accustomed to the cryptic names of ship parts and maneuvres. I thought Stephen Maturin played a more discreet role than usual here, but still my favorite passages in the novel were a couple of extracts from his private journal where he is analyzing the character of his friend and of fellow captains.I wish I could include some quotes and more details about the sailing, the observations of nature and the secondary characters, but I accidentally erased both the book and my bookmarks from my reader. I hope I will do a better job with he next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "I'm bumping my rating of this up to five stars from four after my reread. Damn this is a fine addition to the Aubrey-Maturin series. There is genuine comfort in reading this book, and I think some of that comfort stems from Patrick O'Brian's comfort with his characters. O'Brian knows his men intimately by this fourth book, and he is able to let them live on their own, confident, it seems to me, that they will take him where they need to go.In this case, they take him to the Mauritius campaign of 1809-1811. Jack Aubrey stands in for real life Commodore Josias Rowley, captaining HMS Boadicea, while Stephen is busy fomenting unrest on the islands. Apparently The Mauritius Command follows the true campaign faithfully, which makes for a fascinating experience for those who love historical novels, but the real interest for me is -- as always -- the characters. Whether reading (or rereading) about the family of men, Jack's \"brothers\" and friends and followers, I've grown to love as they live and work, or reading about the pathetically narcissistic Lord Clonfert and the fatally brutal Captain Corbett (who may have met his maker from \"(un)friendly fire\" during a pitched battle with the French), it is a reading experience I am able to fully immerse myself in. O'Brian's is a world I don't ever want to set aside.I believe in O'Brian's fictional men, which makes me believe that O'Brian's take on the real men that surround them is equally plausible, and I want to be part of that group, eating plum duff and \"hauling to\" and boarding the enemy vessel and waiting for news from home. The closest I will ever come is O'Brian's books, but at least I have them."}, {"userName": "Ace", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23405868-ace", "userReview": "I thought I would be enjoying these more as I progressed through the series, but alas I am tired of the language and finding that it's no longer fun for me to try to work out what each sentence means."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "All the main characters, Aubrey and Maturin included, faded into the background of The Mauritius Command, becoming a kind of landscape upon which the drama of Lord Clonfert played out. His was the story that most captured my attention this time through.Clonfert begins the tale as the captain of HMS Otter. He is a vain man. A handsome man who cuts a dashing figure in his finery. He has developed some bravery (after a shaky beginning to his career), is a \"capital seaman\" and has the loyalty of his men. He is also an unabashed liar when it comes to his accomplishments (even suggesting he was present at the killing of a unicorn, using a Narwhal tusk as his evidence), but his vanity quickly undermines his spirit when he's thrust into the shadow of his former shipmate, now commanding officer, Commodore Jack Aubrey.Clonfert is eventually made Post-Captain by the man he sees as his nemesis and is given the frigate HMS N\u00e9r\u00e9ide as his command. He eventually loses his ship and half his face in a poorly executed action, and once he realizes that Jack Aubrey will again return him to command, after the Mauritius Campaign has reached its successful conclusion, he takes his own life in his convalescent bed. It's not a tragic death. It's rather pathetic, actually. O'Brian's expression of Clonfert's fall, however, is touching and strikes at a truth I've witnessed amongst many of those who find themselves in competition with one another. Quite often, the successful person, the \"bull\" in an analogy of Stephen Maturin's, has no idea that the less successful person, the \"frog\" in the same analogy, envies him, hates him, or obsesses over him in any way. So the bull steps on the frog without ever noticing, and as Dr. Maturin suggests, \"how can the bull be blamed ....\" How, indeed?I never want to be a frog, but I fear that there is a bit of that beast in me despite my desire. It is something for which I must be wary. I should probably be wary of being the bull too. Wariness may just be the most benevolent policy. ----------------------I just took a second listen to The Mauritius Command, and Simon Vance's performance held up very well. I know many adore Patrick Tull, and perhaps I would too if I ever had a chance to hear his work, but I have listened to four of the novels now (having read them all first) with Simon doing the narrating, and I feel like my brain has settled in on his rhythms. He's become the voice of these men for me. He's never been my favourite narrator of fiction (I most recently listened to his Dr. No, James Bond), but I have enjoyed his Egyptology readings. His voice just seems to suit the more historically driven tales. Maybe it is the pomposity he can achieve with his voice. I dunno. I do know I liked it, though.

It's well known that he went to great lengths to make his stories ring with authenticity, reading the original logbooks of the vessels involved and the private papers of survivors. In this the fourth episode of his Aubrey-Maturin series, he takes this method to the extreme - his whole book, not only one or two battles, is based on a historical campaign, making for some very dramatic reading.The triumphs and setbacks of a little-known campaign against the French in the Indian Ocean form the basis for the action of this tale. Aubrey receives command of a squadron and has to find ways to overcome the odds. Two flawed captains he has under him make for interesting character studies. We find O'Brian's wit and humor throughout, from the somewhat less than idyllic scene of Aubrey at home at the beginning, a fish out of water, through the vicissitudes of the campaign together with Maturin, to a typical O'Brian ending. He so often winds up his stories on a kind of anticipatory note, leading us into the next book and leaving us with a longing to see how the story will continue . . ."}, {"userName": "Benjamin Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4209082-benjamin-thomas", "userReview": "The fourth novel in this series is yet another masterful telling of seafaring adventure.

It isn\u2019t \u201clite\u201d at all; there is quite a bit of hard action, with complicated maneuvering, and complex characters. Tragedy as well, in an unexpected way. But it doesn\u2019t reach the extreme emotional pitch of the third book, H.M.S. Surprise, so, coming after that intensity, this one has always seemed a bit of relief.I almost said comic relief, and indeed there is some of O\u2019Brian\u2019s most delightful humor, especially in conversations between Stephen Maturin, so sophisticated and formidably insightful except with respect to shipboard skills, and Jack Aubrey, so big and bluff and unsubtle, except when he is out-thinking and outgunning the enemy. There are some really funny exchanges between minor characters, like the two fellows stuck at an outpost. We see them for all of a page and a half, but we get a sense of their personalities and relationships before they touch off another heart-pounding ship-to-ship action.Finally, O\u2019Brian\u2019s narrative voice, which improves exponentially with each book, reaches the pinnacle of playfulness in this one, with lines like \u201cStephen looked at his watch, uttered a low howl, and set off at a shambling run for the harbor, where the Pearl of the Mascarenes, the fastest aviso in the island, lay champing at her buoy.\u201dThe storyline is based on a real action\u2014the actual Mauritius Campaign of 1809-1811, only with Sir Josias Rowley as commodore instead of Jack Aubrey. Who was Rowley, really? Is he the model for the most interesting character (besides Jack and Stephen) in the book, Lord Clonfert? There is little to be found about Rowley, who never married. Clonfert had a wife\u2014apparently he was not only handsome but fatally attractive to women\u2014but his real passion was to be taken as a dashing and brave captain. The first time or two I read this book, I wondered if there was actually a bit of Lord Nelson in Clonfert. The tone of some of Nelson\u2019s dispatches and letters reminds me of Clonfert\u2014just a tad too full of his titles (he signs himself \u201cNelson and Bronte\u201d though the dukedom, awarded by Ferdinand of Naples, was dubious at best), too anxious to be admired by other men. Nelson sailed into battle wearing his Turkish diamond chelenk, as does Clonfert, the sort of show-offy \u201cdash\u201d typical of men like Sir Sydney Smith, whose gaudy dress and actions were not always considered to be in the best of taste by their fellow officers.In any case, O\u2019Brian once again creates a fascinating side character who lingers in memory, set in a book that makes one want to immediately reach for the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Boz4pm", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180005-boz4pm", "userReview": "I have been so absorbed in these books that I keep forgetting to take time to review them in turn - aside from discussions and over-excited bouncing with mutual online friends who already know the series, that is.I love this series so much, for all the reasons I outlined in Master & Commander - the depth and breadth of O'Brian's knowledge and research is outstanding, breathtaking and yet the level of writing mastery he shows in his portrayal of character and plot makes these books utterly brilliant, as well as educational and utterly steeped in the sense of period.Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin are thoroughly engaging as characters, opposites and yet with a strong bond of friendship. Where Aubrey is utterly hopeless on land, Maturin is equally awkward and a liability at sea - both of which cases lead to angst, plot and, particularly in the case of Stephen's near constantly falling out of or between boats, comedy. Indeed it is a mark of O'Brian's brilliance that in between the battles, the moments of pure tension (particularly in those parts involving Stephen's work as a spy), you get moments - often a mere aside or off-hand comment either by a character or the narrator - that can make you laugh out loud.

The connecting thread is the naval career of a John-Bull archetype, Captain Jack Aubrey, in the company of his best friend, ship's surgeon and an Admiralty spy, the cerebral, physically Gollum-like Stephen Maturin, obsessed with the study of nature and physiology, and woefully unlucky in love. The pair regularly play music together in the captain's cabin and occasionally share confidences, but more often co-exist separately while pursuing their own dramas, sometimes but not often as rivals. Jack's an extrovert, a plain speaker and an adventurer, never more at home than in hand-to-hand ship-to-ship combat or trimming and breaking in a vessel to its maximum possible speed and battle efficiency. Stephen is more introverted, eccentric and obsessive, a widely-read intellectual and a loner prone to murky moods. This review will serve for all the books. (And a tip: don't be prejudiced by the -- in my opinion -- flawed Peter Weir effort at capturing the series for the big screen in Master and Commander: the leads were badly miscast and the O'Brian magic was missing, though there was a certain amount to commend.)As in all series, a structural pattern emerges. On entering each story we'll find the pair on land yearning for an assignment, and the author skilfully paints their social, financial and practical ineptitudes off-water. Then a ship is given them, accompanied by a mission, with Stephen usually charged with certain duties of Crown espionage. The ship, as it's shaped to Jack's sailing and fighting tastes, usually becomes one of the story's characters, whereby Jack always wants to take an enemy or privateer because therein lies his fortune: spoils and booty. O'Brian has researched every aspect of Regency naval life including its conventions, politics, systems and flaws, and weaves his knowledge deftly into his plots. After some period traveloguing, there'll be a battle and a victory or a loss, propelling us into the next book.The prose is always more than workmanlike, the suspense supple enough to keep you in. Characterisations are lively and vivid, if rarely passionate, though Jack, refreshingly, exhibits plenty. The tales don't quite rollick, but come close: the author is a sanguine spirit, occasionally cryptic, a habitual dry archness sometimes demanding the reader extricate events from between lines, but never irksomely so. Though English, his pseudonym is Irish, and he enjoys a little irony.Where the books soar is when the ships sail. No one has written boats at sea better: you feel every droplet and you swoop with every gust that fills the sails. He has no patience for ignorance, you have to keep up with the terminology, but there's a handy diagram of a ship as the frontispiece with every sail labelled. The sailing bits and the battles are exhilarating, founded in meticulous and engaging informative preparation within the narrative, and comprehensive elucidation about every pivotal character caught in the conflicts. The series is worth reading for the author's love of the sea, and his gift for rendering it incarnate with words and paper.

'Surprise', Captain Jack Aubrey finally had the chance to marry his beloved and settle down into a little country cottage. The Muaritius Command begins with his bff Doctor Stephen Maturin visiting him and offering Jack an opportunity to go back to sea. Jack leaps at the chance, both to return to the profession he loves and to get away from his hectoring mother-in-law and lumpish twin infants. And even better than he'd expected--when Jack makes it to La Reunon, he finds that he will be commanding the naval action. If he succeeds at the nearly impossible task of snatching Mauritius from the French, he might very well become an Admiral--but if he fails, his career will be over. Jack is outgunned and outmanned, and several of the captains under his command are almost worse than useless. But through his own determined hard work and strategy, and Stephen's sly propaganda on land, success appears almost within reach...I missed Sophie and Diana, and there was less interaction between Stephen and Jack than previously. But I was so glad to read about Stephen's depressed, almost viciously insightful thoughts on the people around him (and his deeply mistaken ideas of what was going on with the navy) and Jack's own terrible jokes and tireless, fearless action. What surprised me the most were Jack's own tact and tactical skills--all too often I fall back into the assumption that Stephen is the smart one, but truly the difference between them is the arenas in which they are gifted.

Wonderful, wonderful stuff. These books are truly more about the world and the characters than the plot, sort of like a video game. In this book, the \"plot\" is essentially the military campaign, battle by battle, but O'Brian seems unconcerned with treating it as such, leaving climactic battles between chapters (or in the hands of minor characters), and instead focusing on Jack wondering about his vegetable garden or Stephen wondering about Jack wondering about his vegetable garden. In one scene Stephen is moving between ships, falls into the drink and nearly dies, but it gets only about a longish paragraph and has little to no lasting effect on anyone.

Also nice to read what may have been happening on the other side of all that crossed correspondence that drives Austen's domestic plots.I was a bit distracted by some errant misogynistic bits in this novel, though--granted, haven't read 1 or 2 yet, but I didn't feature Jack Aubrey as a character that would harbor such blatant disappointment over ahem, TWINS, even though they were girls. Particularly when he can take the loss of all but two of his ships around chapter 8 with such equanimity. But perhaps I'm missing some characterization at this point--Stephen Maturin in particular is getting more complex. I'll give O'Brian at least three more novels to correct this before I give up on the boy's Jane Austen."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63599-rob", "userReview": "I continue to love the Aubrey/Maturin series. The Mauritius command excels in further character development by contrasting both Aubrey and Maturin with other captains and medical men in a small fleet commanded by Jack to take on the French. It's exciting, fast-paced, and a great read. A worthy successor to Post Captain and H.M.S.

I wasn't disappointed as it turned out to be as rollicking good fun as its predecessors, even if I still don't know my mizen from my masthead.Having married his sweetheart, Sophie, and settled in a long-dreamed for cottage, The Mauritius Command finds Jack Aubrey on land and on half pay. His dreams didn't quite match reality, however, and the cottage is not only pokey but also contains his domineering mother-in-law and two hairless twins who, to make matters worse, aren't even boys. His cabbages are being munched by caterpillars, and even the bees that were Dr Maturin's gift have died (not the bees!). Thank heavens then, for the timely reappearance of Stephen and a set of secret orders to sail the frigate Boadicea to the Cape and onto Mauritius, where Jack is to harry the French while flying a Commodore's pendant.A step-up in command brings its own problems, however, and Jack is soon striving for success while managing the difficult personalities of the Captains under him - the showy and insecure Clonfert, the capable but cruel Corbett who takes better care of his brass than his men, and Pym, the numpty whose incompetence nearly spells disaster - while Stephen spreads subversive literature and schools the crews in an early bit of Hearts and Minds - no thieving and raping, please, gentlemen! Everything that I've come to love about this series is still present and correct - the fantastic characterisation, the astounding amounts of food that Jack puts away, the wonderful insights into life at sea and the throwaway asides that make me snort (\"...the surviving swine struck down into the hold together with the goat, which, in the general silence, could be heard bleating angrily for its long overdue tobacco\") and most of all, the relationship between Jack and Stephen (\"Jack loved him, and had not the least objection to granting him all the erudition in the world, while remaining inwardly convinced that in all practical matters other than physic and surgery Stephen should never be allowed out alone.\")Ahhhh, Stephen. Skilled surgeon, dedicated naturalist, super-spy, the man I'd most want on my side in an argument and an all round colossus of a character, Stephen has wormed his way into being my favourite character of all time, and made it look as easy as kiss my hand. Wibble.I was going to give this a four as its not even the best that I've read in this series so far, but sod it. I loved every minute of it so much, it's getting a five.**Also posted at Randomly Reading and Ranting**"}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1970934-thomas", "userReview": "Excellent like well all I've said about the series before. I particularly like the expansion of scope from purely naval actions to the complexities of an invasion.Reread 3-27-16: Upgraded from 4 stars to 5. Still amazing, this time though I find myself drawn much more to the personal narrative then the grand action set pieces. Especially Stephen Maturian, towards the end when he asks McAdam, fellow physician much given to maladies of the mind, about his own state:  After a long pause he said, \"McAdam, you know more about this aspect of medicine than I do: what do you say to a patient with no physical injury, no tangible lesion, who loses all real concern with his life? Who takes a disgust to the world? A scholar, say, who has edited Livy, Livy his sole study and his delight: he stumbles on the lost books, carries them home, and finds he has not the courage, the spirit to open even the first. He does not care about Livy's Lost books, nor about his books that known, nor about any books or authors at all. They do not interest him. He will not lift the cover; and he sees that very soon his own animal functions will not interest him either. Do you understand me? Have you seen cases of this sort in your practice?\"\"Certainly I have. And they are not so rare, neither, even in men that are kept busy.\"\"What is the prognosis? How do you see the nature of the malady?\" I won't get into his reply but it's fairly devastating, and very prescient. Rereading these so far has been a real delight, not just for the experience of reliving the series but also having an eye to the grand narrative that's being built up, page by page, book by book. Fantastic."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/817278-jennifer", "userReview": "It strikes me as blackly amusing that the end of each Regency romance book--the happy clinch and fade to implied domestic bliss--leads directly to the opening of so many Age of Sail books--the hero chafing at the domestic life and yearning to escape and be at sea again.Jack Aubrey is a commodore in this story, which means he is in charge of leading several different ships. Much of the book is dedicated to the interpersonal difficulties dealing with disparate prickly, sensitive, or craven personalities presents, and a major theme of the book could be that battles are won and lost in part due to mismatched personalities or personal grudges rather than brilliant strategy or force of arms. Frustratingly, one of the major secondary characters remains a complex cipher throughout--almost painfully realistic and ultimately unknowable.Also frustrating is that the inability of Stephen and Jack to truly understand each other, played for affectionate laughs early in the series, becomes sometimes excruciating as good-hearted and straightforward Jack is incapable of seeing what the reader sees: that Stephen's melancholy in the last book has settled into a deep depression that remains unresolved at the end of the book. All in all, this is an unsettlingly sad read. But I've come to care about Jack and Stephen so much that there's no turning my back on the series."}, {"userName": "Captain Sir Roddy, R.N.

The Mauritius Command, is just that -- a study in command -- and as such, should be required reading for anyone in a position of command and authority. I would particularly recommend this for young military commissioned and/or non-commissioned officers, especially those in the sea-going services; and I would be surprised if this is not on a reading list for midshipman at the U.S. Naval and Coast Guard Academies. In this book, the fourth novel of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, we see the full maturation of Jack Aubrey in his role of Captain and Commodore leading a squadron of Royal Navy men-of-war in an effort to capture the strategic islands of Mauritius and La Reunion, off of the southeast coast of Africa from Napoleon. Together, Jack and Stephen Maturin have to address the difficult military, diplomatic, and political requirements of the mission in order to achieve success. With the exception of the novel's fictional characters, Patrick O'Brian has scrupulously followed and described the real-life historical accounts of this fascinating campaign. The Mauritius Command is a page-turner from page one until the last. Truly an amazing work of historical fiction by one of the Age's greatest authors!"}, {"userName": "Ensiform", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform", "userReview": "The fourth book in the Aubrey-Maturin series. Languishing at home on half pay, Jack is unexpectedly given a commission to go as acting Commodore to the Cape of Good Hope, where he will direct a small squadron to take the French-held islands of Mauritius and Reunion. The captains under Jack\u2019s command are slightly jealous, but they are motivated primarily by their differing natures, whether harsh taskmasters or eager to please and ineffective. After some easy victories, helped along by Stephen\u2019s psych-op machinations, a particularly bloody battle ensues. Defeat looms, but Jack\u2019s pure bulldogged determination turns the tide, until the victory and glory is taken from his grasp by one of his own allies.While I believe that this series really takes off in the next two books, this is a vibrant and thrilling historical novel. Focusing heavily on the nautical warfare \u2013 and its specific, archaic jargon, such that several passages may as well have been in Greek to me \u2013 and the rigid manners of the era \u2013 a window to the psychology of the culture, as recorded by the ever-perspicacious Stephen, it makes for a rich historical excursion. It also is a delight in rewarding the careful reader; plot points are made via inferences through a single line of dialogue, rather than tedious filler. Another very enjoyable and erudite entry."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4867502-jennifer", "userReview": "Even though this was based on a real historical naval engagement, there was more telling than showing compared to the previous novels.

Some new characters are introduced, none of them really stellar, but they have an impact on the story.
