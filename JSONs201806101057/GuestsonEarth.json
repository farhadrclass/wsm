I was very interested to read Lee Smith's treatment of the tragedy at Highland Hospital in Asheville that resulted in the death of Zelda Fitzgerald, as it has been a subject that has intrigued me (as all things Asheville do). I've read about it a bit myself, though not nearly to the thorough extent Ms. Smith has, as evidenced by her \"Note on Sources.\" Though she opens the book with the AP news report of the 1948 fire at Highland Hospital, and the first page of chapter one begins with the narrator saying she has intended for years to write her own impressions of Zelda Fitzgerald and \"to bring a certain insight and new information\" to the horrific tragedy, Smith doesn't really accomplish that. What she has done instead is to create a fascinating character, Evalina Toussaint, and placed her in the halls of the hospital for \"nervous diseases\" at the time of Zelda's on and off again treatment there. Though the reader feels she comes to know Evalina, she and her past remain a bit mysterious. She seems a reliable and honest narrator - a good student, an industrious worker, one who follows rules and doesn't buck the system. Is she actually damaged by her past and her genetic heritage? For Evalina certainly was a hard luck story - the daughter of a courtesan who loved her, but whose own mental health was fragile, and raised in the red light district of New Orleans, while being taught by the nuns at the Catholic school. Her surroundings improve when her mother becomes mistress to a wealthy man who puts them up in a home of their own, but it is only a brief respite until she is orphaned and her mother's lover sends her off to Highland Hospital. Evalina had been traumatized by her mother's death and couldn't speak or eat, and thus she became a patient and a ward at the hospital. She manages to escape the insulin shock treatments by her own wariness and cunning, but observes the effects on others. Mrs. Carroll, the wife of the medical director of Highland, takes Evalina under her wing and tutors her in the piano, eventually sending her off to study at the Peabody Institute, and attempts to direct the course of her life. But Evalina falls prey to other elemental desires and leaves her studies, following a lover to Paris and back and eventually to New Orleans again, until she has a collapse of her own and ends up back in Highland (the mechanics of which are never quite satisfactorily explained). The bulk of the action takes place in Asheville, in and around Highland Hospital, and we meet many of the patients, or 'guests', and staff from both Evalina's childhood and adult years. Smith has the ability to make them all distinct individuals, but, alas, there are too many of them to be able to keep up with! Part of this may be the very environment that a hospital would engender - patients are always coming and leaving, so of course Evalina is always making new friends, only to have them return to their own homes. For Evalina, Highland becomes her home. But I found myself having to try to remember the salient details of the various mental patients who walked through these pages and not confuse the many characters. Zelda Fitzgerald is only one, but as the celebrity centerpiece she is given special accord, much as she is treated as a patient at Highland. Smith has done a good job, I feel, in the depiction of Zelda and made her behavior seem believable, but Zelda is not the focus of the novel. As well as the patients, several of the doctors and staff become significant characters, and here Smith blends fact and fiction, because, like Zelda, several are actually real people. I wished that Smith had given more background in her acknowledgements about some of these real life characters, and how she had fleshed them out. There are also some real people I think I recognize whose names she has changed.Smith is excellent at placing the hospital in its setting. For one who knows the area, the places are easy to recognize, but, more than that, she evokes the beauty of the mountains and a bit of the wildness of Appalachia. She gets the flora right (there is a good bit of work in the garden and walks in the woods) and manages to convey the lovely mix of wildflowers and cultivated this area is blessed with. The characters Ella Jean and Pan most embody the native mountain folk, with Pan being as elemental as his name evokes, more than just a 'mountain man,' but one who is at one with nature and beasts. In another culture he would be considered a shaman. Evalina is inexorably drawn to the deep peace at the center of his strangeness, yet I found her attraction unconvincing, especially after her experiences with Joey and then Freddy. I didn't find her romantic attachments compelling, though I can't say why, particularly. The feelings weren't convincing somehow, especially when she is courting Freddy and going off to Pan's lair at the same time.The most disappointing part of the book is the ending. We know from the outset that the story is progressing to the devastating fire at Highland. But this, both its causes and aftereffects, are given short shrift, a mere five and a half pages at the end of the book. The last chapter, slightly more than two pages, didn't seem believable at all. It was as if, after finally getting to the fire, the author decided to end the book, though the story wasn't over. Evalina's postscript was hardly satisfying, as well as unconvincing. This is a book that is beautiful at times, intriguingly giving a glimpse into an expensive and highly regarded mental institution of the 1930's and 40's, without overly indulging in the horrors of either mental illness or the now cruel-seeming archaic treatments of the time. The characters, though often difficult and downright wacky, are made real and sympathetic. Zelda is seen in both her bright and dark moments. Evalina herself, though we feel we have come to know her, remains elusive still. The question lurks in the background - were women who just didn't fit into societal norms considered ill and needing rehabilitation? The sad conclusion was too often a yes."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3577969-liz", "userReview": "While I found this book surprisingly enjoyable with a well-developed and likable main character, I can't give it a higher rating. The author seems to have gotten to the end and just given up entirely. The entire \"climax\" of the book (as defined by the back cover) takes place in the last ten pages, and we get no real sense of its significance. [Spoiler] This is a story about a woman who breaks down after the death of her mother, again after the death of her daughter, and we are supposed to believe she just watches the only home she's ever known burn down, with 9 of her friends in it, and she's just completely fine?

Her mother had died and she found herself in untenable circumstances, which will eventually lead her to this cutting edge hospital for mental disorders under the innovative Dr. Carroll. There she will find a home and friends that will become for her a new family and a supportive community.Of course, this hospital became famous because of Zelda Fitzgerald, who was in and out of care here, for many years. She plays a role in this story as Evalina is here at the same time Zelda is also hospitalized. We get to meet the enigmatic Zelda, the sad Zelda, and Evalina herself remarks that Zelda never looks the same way twice. The reader will meet many other characters and get an insightful view of the treatments available for the mentally ill at this time. Some of the woman committed here are here because they do not fit into the society of which they are part. Not being happy in a life, that one should be, children, wonderful husband but still sad and in they go. Insulin shock therapy, ECT and other treatments are all used to jolt these women back into a semblance of compliance or wellness. I greatly came to sympathize and to like many of these woman, and at book's end realized I would miss many of them. They had their own community ,put on dances and shows, suffered with and leaned on each other. The fire that would kill Zelda and others happened in 1948, and the author offers explanations on how and who started the fire, though I don;;t believe that a cause was ever really stated to a degree of certainty. The author became interested in Zelda and the hospital because she has first hand knowledge, her own father being a patient there in the fifties and her son, ongoing treatment there in the eighties. I loved how the author treated all these women so tenderly, writing with a great deal of empathy, showing the courage of those thought to be mentally ill and those who were not, but still needed help of some kind. Also some of the doctors, who tried to find more humane treatment for those who needed them most and who treated them as people and grew to care about them.

It is much more thought provoking a protest as well.This quiet story is a daisy chain tale of women\u2019s lives, back in a time when being wifely was expected. Zelda Fitzgerald is featured as one of the women patients - called guests - of a psychiatric hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, but she is but one flower in this exotic bouquet. Girls who sunk into depression following family tragedies were sent here or chose to come of their own free will. Chemical shock treatments with high doses of insulin were used to induce comas and wipe ugly memories away. Electro shock therapy was prescribed as a daily treatment for weeks on end. While this type hospital sounds nightmarish today, staying there was usually a bit of relief, if you can believe it. There were nature hikes, gardening, mini dance performances, art class. If you forgot that you\u2019d ever given birth to a damaged child or lost a baby, so much the better. Introspection was avoided. In a surreal sort of way, these \u2018guests\u2019 dealt with pain by erasing it.Women who were incredible writers, musicians, and scholars often had their wings clipped by societal expectation in a way girls today will never fully appreciate. Sacrifice and submittal were revered, and if a woman could not bring herself to do so with grace, she questioned her own sanity.There were male patients too, and employees who had once been under care of the doctors. A boy locked in a cage for years and another who was simply too brilliant for his aristocratic family to understand found a type of Eden at the hospital. Like Zelda Fitzgerald and many others, they would live in the real world for a period of time only to return to this place of safety. Interesting that the author took the title for this book from a letter that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote to daughter Scottie while her mom Zelda was back at Highland Hospital. It evokes respect and compassion to her and the other patients. \u201cThe insane are always mere guests on earth, eternal strangers carrying around broken decalogues that they cannot read.\u201dFor some reason, this novel was listed as a mystery. The hospital itself had a tragic fire that took the life of Zelda Fitzgerald and eight other female guests in the late 40s, and I was under the impression that the storyline would be more about the actual cause of the murderous blaze. The nine were upstairs in a locked ward and couldn't get out, and no one has ever pinpointed the cause for the fire's start. Instead of a trumpet-blaring solution to this mystery, I found a beautiful work of introspection and subtle commentary on how intelligent and talented women have had to subjugate themselves. On how men and women both face emotional or biochemical turmoil that not all are armed well enough to manage. This was more Sylvia Plath Bell Jar than what I was in the mood for, but it was beautiful.What with the angry fuschia signs, full of vulgarity plastered all over the television this week, the juxtaposition with this tale was jarring. Had I not read this book while all this was going on, I might not have had as much appreciation for this writer as I now do. I absolutely salute Lee Smith for putting forth a more logical, revelatory case for women\u2019s rights. No tantrums. No screeching. Just a clever, thoughtful message that hits home."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "As a literary work, \"Guests on Earth\" deserves meritorious accolades. Lee Smith certainly is quite the gifted southern literary wordsmith. The cadence and structure of her sentences are impeccably beautiful. Usage of symbolism, atmosphere, and verisimilitude is equally impressive. Smith's aptitude for crafting interesting, fully fleshed out characters, both fictional and factual is also commendable. And as for era and setting: what better time and place than the thirties and forties in a bohemian mental sanitarium in the Blue Ridge Mountains?  You were a little swan . . . gliding across dark water.\"On the flip-side, a novel heavily entrenched in literary nuances doesn't always make for the most satisfying novel in an overall storytelling sense - as one might hope to find in popularized general or historical fiction. A reader must really take their time with this one, looking for the story beneath the story. Having read this while visiting family in North Carolina, just south of Asheville where I once lived for thirteen years, I was excited to be reading something regionally/culturally connected. Yet at the same time, I really didn't have the time and attention required to fully appreciate such a literary piece. Which probably explains why I thought the story lagged a bit here and there and lost cohesive momentum. Still though, I'm quite happy to have bought and read it. Thank you \"Joy of Books\" bookshop of Hendersonville, NC for stocking so many wonderful regional tomes set and/or penned in western North Carolina. My suitcase came back heavier than when I arrived.

She did a brilliant job of combining historical events with the fictitious characters she created. The story is told by Evalina who spends the majority of her life as a \"guest\" at Highland Hospital in Asheville, NC. The hospital and the famous Dr. Carroll were real, as were the infamous Zelda Fitzgerald who was a guest there as well until she died in a fire at the hospital.  Highland was a mental hospital which was very progressive for it's time. I thought Smith did a wonderful job of allowing the reader to have a true glimpse into the world of mental illness, and the people who both suffer with it and those who care for them. Her characters were believable and I could imagine any one of them being based on real folks. They came from all walks of life, all different social levels but almost became family in this institutional setting. Though ill, these patients were creative, talented and most were caring. I appreciated how she conveyed the compassion and empathy that the staff had towards their somewhat unique wards. This was not a \"one size fits all\" hospital and every effort was made to allow these women (and men) to return to productive lives as the unique people they were. So many folks in that time ended up in mental hospitals and did not need to be there, but after time had become institutionalized and couldn't leave successfully. I loved most of these characters....I loved the tidbits of southern and mountain life, from descriptions of Asheville and New Orleans, the Grove Park, the food, the music, dances and fashions of the time as well as the \"voices\" of these characters....I could hear the cadence, the accents and their tone as they spoke.  The only reason that this was not a 5 star read was due to a few not as believable things....that Evalina would have so much freedom, her relationship with Pan. Throughout the book I felt that she would be a survivor, and turn out fine as I felt she was not as \"ill\" or unbalanced as most of the characters and I took everything she said as the truth....and I loved that Smith added just enough at the end that I questioned if that was so or not."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "This novel paints a picture and creates a world of Highland Hospital in Asheville, NC through the eyes of Evalina Toussaint, an unusual child who spent her teen years and a lot of her adulthood \"inside the snow globe\" as a patient and staff member of the mental hospital.

Why? There were too many skips in the story line, too many unanswered questions, too many sequelae that simply did not make sense within the foundation or characterization established by the author. There were also too many characters wandering in and out of the Highland Hospital as noted by another reviewer. Before closing the book, I checked the reviews here on GoodReads and saw that the ending was going to be both disappointing and anti-climactic. At the time I was being saddened to see our protagonist, Evalina, running off to Pan's lair while being courted by Freddy. I really didn't want to read about that further.Some of the unanswered questions throughout the book included, Who was supporting Evalina? Yes, her stepfather paid for her original hospitalization, but [it was made clear] not later. What about her education? Yes, she had a scholarship, but I doubt seriously that that included clothes and transportation and food away from campus. What about her professional career in music? That's not something you just walk away from. She had worked long years to become skilled and to establish herself professionally. And I could go on and on. Why didn't she stay with the nuns where she was safe and happy rather than being shuttled off to NC?The time sequences didn't flow, either. That may have been a matter of poor proofing or editing, but it was very distracting. For example, Zelda returned to the hospital before Christmas 1948. From p. 213: \"[Zelda]'s only 48, I remember because she was born in 1900.\" After Christmas, came January 1948 and the fire was March 11, 1948. So obviously it was 1947, not 1948.There were similar holes in the time flow in Evalina's life.

The book jacket seems to promise something the novel couldn't deliver. While Zelda Fitzgerald is present in the story, she doesn't play any central role, only appears periodically and is never revealed as more than a caricature of herself. Based on the book blurb I was expecting more.The books starts off slowly, the narrator, Evalina Tousaint, narrates, her recollections, despite including some very emotionally charged situations, are rather staid. There\u2019s also a lot of telling rather than showing. Many difficult relationships and feelings are either mentioned in passing or rattled off like items on a grocery list. For a novel that focuses around women who are institutionalized this novel surprisingly lacks a depth of emotion. There are many issues that are never explored and on the whole I think more is left unsaid than said.Though there were elements and relationships that were well done and enjoyable, I liked the setting in Asheville, NC and the history of treating mental illness was interesting.

I've been fascinated with stories about Zelda Fitzgerald all summer long, as you know. This novel by Ms Smith has a different twist as it's seeing Zelda through the eyes of a young girl throughout her life who is actually raised as an orphan in Ashville's Highland House sanatorium. The really strong kicker of this book, however, is the extension of mini-vignettes of other patients at the hospital connected to the orphan, Evalina.The different characters' mental illnesses mesmerized me. Their manifestations weren't always evident at first glance which made it even more intriguing. The characters were respectfully and beautifully drawn. In fact, this book will be so memorable in that respect to me. Often mentally ill people aren't as kindly written or talked about, or even as well understood whether in literature or in the \"outside\" world.The showcase character of this book wasn't Zelda as I had expected. While she popped up as a main figure at times, and she was always on the mind of the main character, Evalina, she wasn't the focus of the novel. I found this not at all a problem. It really didn't take away from the interest of the story, though when she was included, it was like salt to the whole and was a point of clarity that Zelda was only one of many who suffered from a mental disorder.The sections that told of Zelda and Fitzgerald and their intimate times observed were sweet and sorrowful, capturing the essence not only of their relationship, it seemed, but of so many relationships that flounder under the heavy blanket of the mental heartbreak. I thought these were especially lovely passages.This is a book that flows easily from the pen of Lee Smith to our hearts. I loved the many characters, the story it told and the hope it engenders about the future of those who suffer mental illness. It spreads a good message that those who walk that path are special people who are just like anyone else, but who have to overcome injuries like many on earth do, as well. It speaks to their courage as well as those injuries and flaws.I loved this book and hope many of you will be inspired to pick it up to read this year.5 stars Deborah/TheBookishDame"}, {"userName": "Erika Robuck", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2103117-erika-robuck", "userReview": "GUESTS ON EARTH is taut and captivating, a vivid and moving account of one girl\u2019s life as she progresses from a difficult childhood to an even more difficult adulthood.

This perspective allows readers to experience the treatment of those deemed insane or suffering from mental disorders in the 1930s and \u201840s. Smith has created a novel that examines creativity and passion, the rules that women of the time needed to follow and the consequences of breaking those rules, and the treatment of those deemed mentally unstable in a time when not much was understood about mental health.

Our protagonist, Evalina Toussaint, comes to Highland Hospital in Asheville, NC in 1936 a young orphaned girl. Immediately she is taken under the wing of the wife of the head psychiatrist who sees the young girl's musical talent. Throughout the novel, Eva comes of age and eventually turns from patient to staff member. Zelda Fitzgerald is also a patient there, and the two bond...somewhat. Z comes in more like a character to represent the symbolism of growth, \"the nature of time\", ultimately revealed in her \"Dance of the Hours\" ending. That works okay for me since she really only plays a minor character in the story.I also enjoyed the salamander theme throughout the book; the mythical and natural, the mythical being Zelda, the natural being Eva. I found that very interesting.What irks me regarding the narration is the abrupt middle portion of the novel. Up until that point we get a fairly reliable if a wee bit teetering too familiar 1st person past tense narrator. As Eva moves to music school (after being threatened shock treatment if she didn't --what?!?!), we jump to a series of letters as sent to her \"mother\", Dr. Carroll's wife. Okay, Lee Smith, I see what you are doing there, and I can appreciate that. Then we jump back to her previous narrative style, totally leaving out a certain major plot point, saving that nugget for a later clumsily placed flashback. (Oh, and then getting some shock treatment after all -- huh!?!?) If this technique was done for some form of suspense for the reader, it came off irritating to me more than anything. Another irksome bit was the way the narrator suddenly and informally tells us various patient \"stories\" and how they came to arrive there. Usually starting off with an awkward, \"Oh hey (reader), let me tell you so and so's story.\" Well okay, I guess that may have been the only way the exposition could be done, but I found it atrociously staged.Again with these type of historical novels based on fact, the actual history is the most fascinating; Smith captures well Highland Hospital and that era of psychiatric care. Those captured moments are really the highlight of the book for me."}, {"userName": "Amelia Gremelspacher", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18276376-amelia-gremelspacher", "userReview": "\"Any life is such - different stories like different strands.\" Our narrator, Evalina, has spent much of her life in Highland Hospital, and institute for the insane. Famously, it is also the home of Zelda Fitzgerald who stays there on and off until the end of her life. Evalina employs the insights she has learned in treatment to share the the diverse paths of her closest fellow patients and of the staff. As a narrator, she possesses the precious ability to share what she sees within herself as well as her insights into other minds. Psychotherapy itself plays a vital character in this novel. Evalina' a stays at Highland Hospital have afforded her a view of theories as they come and go in dominance. She and her fellow patients encounter occupational therapy, insulin therapy, group therapy, and finally talking therapy. On the horizon is shock therapy never given to Evalina, and lobotomy only glimpsed in its casualties admitted on site.I do find it difficult to separate out the cult of Zelda Fitzgerald whose recent popularity serves to actually muddy the novel for me. However, the mystery of the fire that ended her life serves as a dominant foreshadowing throughout this book, so the plot demands her presence. Far more interesting to me is Evalina herself who had come to the hospital after being told that her father is also her mother's father. Her growth and observations serve to hold the plot together and to enable the reader to know a number of other fascinating characters. My two favorites are Jinx, who is present due to her incorrigibility, and Pan, found caged and mute in his mother's basement. Of course as a patient, Evalina misses much of the treatment of those patients who are unable to join their stories to those struggling to find a place to stand in the world. I think this weakens the overall picture of the hospital in a possibly unavoidable way. Still, in the tapestry of this book, Smith's prose readily shares with us the status we share with these characters as guests on Earth."}, {"userName": "Candice", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/189647-candice", "userReview": "Zelda Fitzgerald, the wife of F. Scott Fitzgerald was tragically killed in a fire at Highland Hospital (a mental hospital) in Asheville, NC on March 10, 1948. Ms. Smith tells a story of life in that institution through the eyes of a young woman, Evalina Toussaint, the daughter of a New Orleans exotic dancer, who has been sent to Highland at the age of 13 and remains there for several years. It is an absorbing piece of historical fiction as many of the characters in the book are real historical figures. Prominently figured is Dr. Robert Carroll who was a pioneer in mental health treatment in the 1930s and 40s. Ms. Smith introduces us to a host of colorful characters, tells why they are hospitalized and describes some of the treatment processes. Since the book begins with a newspaper account of the fire, we know that is looming in the future. I feel that I know more about Zelda Fitzgerald after reading this book and it inspired me to look at some of her paintings.

Scott Fitzgerald. This book attempts to blend fact and fiction to explore a somewhat dark topic in history, that being the treatment of the mentally ill in the early to mid 2oth Century. It is set in the real Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, a private mental institution catering to the upper classes, where the patients were referred to as \"guests.\" Highland is famous for a tragedy which occurred there in 1948, a fire that killed nine patients, including Zelda Fitzgerald, the wife of writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. The fictional protagonist in the novel is Evalina Toussaint, the daughter of a New Orleans exotic dancer, who is placed in the institution at the age of thirteen by her mother's married lover, after she suffers an emotional breakdown following her mother's death. Through Evalina's eyes, we meet the real life figures of Mrs. Fitzgerald, pioneering psychiatrist Robert Carroll, and his concert pianist wife Grace. We also meet numerous other fictional staff and patients, and while the stories are somewhat interesting, I found there to be too many characters, many quite poorly developed, and some of their stories seemed to contribute little to the overall goal of the novel. The most fascinating part of this story, for me, was the approach to the treatment of mental illness at the time, which now appears very barbaric, and included insulin shock therapy and electroshock therapy. My biggest complaint about this novel is the very abrupt ending, which left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied. It is as if the author didn't know how to end the story, and just rushed through the ending. Having spent over three hundred pages building up to the fire, she then didn't seem to know how to tell the story of the fire itself and its aftermath. I wanted to hear more of what happened after, and not just read a very unsatisfactory and not very believable epilogue. It was still a great read, but I just found myself wanting a little bit more."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22768819-michelle", "userReview": "Guests on Earth by Lee Smith tells the story of Evalina, the child of a New Orleans exotic dancer.

While in his home, the first sign of mental illness presents itself, and she is sent to Highland Hospital in Ashville NC\u2014a progressive insane asylum for the wealthy who call the residents guests. At Highland, Evalina forms a makeshift family of colorfully tragic characters, finds love, herself and maybe even hope for a future.Music features heavily as we follow Evalina from her childhood in New Orleans into her early 20\u2019s at the hospital. Real residents like Zelda Fitzgerald and Nina Simone make appearances; and having read other reviews of the book, I knew not to expect a Zelda heavy story. Since it spans so many years, some parts are breezed through with the use of postcards and newspaper clippings, which were a great way to prevent the story from becoming overwhelming.Many of the characters were repeat guests who came to view Highland as their home, Zelda and Evalina especially. At one point, a nurse and patient muse that the reason so many of the women return is that they just don\u2019t fit in and society doesn\u2019t know what to do with them. The splashes of local culture and color kept me aware that no matter how homelike Highland came to feel for the characters, it was still a mental hospital for the privileged. Though not really featured in-depth, there were discussions and use of \u2018modern\u2019 psychiatric treatments like insulin comas, electroshock therapy, and equine serums, and the disapproval of horrifying lobotomies and forced sterilizations were touched on.The novel ends with the famous fire that killed several of the residents trapped in a lock ward and conjecture as to who really started it. I\u2019m not really sure what to make of Evalina\u2019s ending, She returns to New Orleans where she\u2019s built a life, but is still holding onto delusional hopes from the past. But, maybe that\u2019s the point\u2013Highland will always be her real home because she just doesn\u2019t fit.

I've read several others and liked them all, she's a good writer. I live near Asheville so have read all about Zelda Fitzgerald's death at Highland Hospital. I guess that's what she started with and tried to write a story around it. I won't go through the plot, although there's barely any, because you can read it on the book site. Besides having very little story line, we don't see much of Zelda, people drift in and out making it difficult to keep track of them, and the ending was totally off kilter. Was Smith trying to let us know what a mental hospital was like in the 40's, giving us a glimpse into Zelda's \"problems\", or trying to make us decide whether Evalina is sane or insane? Maybe all three, but I don't think she did a good job of any of them which is a shame because any of those fully developed would have made a much better book. To add to this, Smith makes a few errors of time and place which add to the confusion. The Christmas before the fire was in 1948 and the fire the next March was also in 1948. Evalina and her friends go \"down from the mountains\" into Asheville (Highland Hospital is not on a mountain) and then up again onto a mountain north of town to eat dinner. Makes no sense to those of us who know Asheville which is probably quite a few of the people who read Smith's novels. Perhaps just carelessness, but disconcerting nonetheless.

This book is interesting mostly for the window it provides into how mental illness was diagnosed and treated at the time, and for its descriptions of Zelda Fitzgerald. Ms. Smith did meticulous research on the hospital and on Mrs. Fitzgerald, and I especially enjoyed her portrayal of this troubled, mercurial woman. The plot, however, meanders off into a number of different directions, some of which don't move the book forward.
