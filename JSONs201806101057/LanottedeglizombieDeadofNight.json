He unzips a body bag and *powie* the stiff opens his eyes, grins and chomps into the unsuspecting mortician. And so begins the zombie apocalypse. The dead guy goes out and kills some more people. The dead doc wakes up, kills some people. And the people they kill wake up and kill some more people. Typical zombie Armageddon stuff. Unfortunately, based upon the excellent Rot & Ruin by the same author, I was expecting more. Don't get me wrong. It is not a bad story. It's fun. It moves quick. The characters are somewhat interesting. People are slow to catch on and the zombies find easy victims. The survivors hole up in a secure facility and hope for rescue. The government finds out and wants to firebomb everything to 'cleanse' the outbreak. It's just very typical and, after a bit, kinda boring because I couldn't shake the sense of 'been there, done that.' How many times have I read or seen this story line play out. Yes, there are unique twists. The author does a decent job of explaining the outbreak. (It's a parasitic infection or sorts). The zombified people are actually trapped in their bodies, conscious but unable to stop themselves as they rip apart their victims - whether they are strangers or family members. There is also a strangely conscious and in-control serial killer who is also completely insane and spreading the virus. However, even this is kind of meh. I found them kind of interesting and kind of 'so-what.' Three brains out of five. If you really, really like your zombies, not a bad book. If you just want to read one really good zombie book try Rot & Ruin (by the same author) or The Girl with All the Gifts."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "Dead of Night is you basic run-of-the-mill zombie novel, unoriginal and not very memorable.

In a genre full of similar stories with cliche descriptions, Dead of Night was refreshing and scary. The other book I've read of his, Patient Zero, had some of the best zombie action I've read. Where that book was more of a thriller with zombies, Dead of Night is a more traditional, zombie outbreak in a small town type of story, which is more to my preference. If you like that kind of book, I recommend reading Dead of Night.Dead of Night is about a troubled female cop characterized by her curves and the attitude that makes them almost unappealing; her ex-boyfriend who is a journalist drawn to her town through an investigation into a recent execution; and the person who should have been executed but somehow managed to kill everyone in the morgue of his former hometown. Mr. Maberry does a little explaining about how the zombie virus was created and how it turned up in this small town. He also seems to have done his homework on how the police and military would respond.The characters started out rough, but won me over in the end. The female cop, Dez, is introduced as she wakes up next to her one night stand and has to hurry to respond to a murder scene. Her attitude is not an endearing quality, and even though her father figure police officer superior gives us a hint of a possible redemption story, she doesn't start off as a character I'd enjoy rooting for as the lead of the story. We soon meet her ex-boyfriend and his journalist partner, Billy Trout and (Something) Goat, and I was really turned off by their sex-centered banter filtered into their investigation of the missing body of the executed prisoner. At this point, the story was decent and the writing above average, but I didn't think the overall experience was going to work for me because the only character I liked was the father figure, who was a minor character. The place where it turned around was when we heard the aunt of the executed prisoner describe how that poor child was treated in foster care and her regret for letting him out of her care. The other relationships became more endearing as the story progressed and the deaths made an emotional difference because of that.The sequel is out and I am going to get to it soon.This review was for the audiobook version. The narrator did a great job with characters and adding suspense and humor suitable to the context of the writing. I would seek out this narrator for other audiobooks.

Others are also participating in the uncrippling of the genre, (D. Wellington, S.G. Browne, M. Brooks) helping drive a resurrection to a dying and over saturated plot crutch.Quick Summary \u2013 A serial killer is put to death. The world breathes easier when they know he is gone, when witnesses have seen him pumped full of poison. They feel safer, with one less killer on death row. The citizens of Stebbins County find themselves feeling less than safe a day later though.There are four main issues impairing their \u201cfeel good\u201d feelings of goodness:1- The poisons put into this killer were not what were approved by the State of Pennsylvania corrections.2- His burial on prison grounds was bypassed by a previously unknown next of kin, meaning his body was moved to a local off site facility.3- Homer Gibbons has gotten up off his slab and is walking around with his flesh decaying and an insatiable desire to stuff his face with anything that bleeds.4- A massive storm cell is creeping to a halt over the area, winds are high, rain is heavy, and everyone is heading to emergency shelters, where they will be packed in like sardines till the weather crisis has passed.Stebbins County Pennsylvania is thoroughly screwed.Maberry, worked a number of atypical angles in his telling of the Stebbins County apocalypse. One example, the first character introduced is a recently bitten human, who\u2019s consciousness is still active, even as his body is failing to respond to his commands. He can see, hear, smell, feel; He just cant stop the beast he is becoming. Maberry is not the first to write from the point of view of a Zombie, showing that intelligence exists, and how it is retained. But his choice of perspective and the details/history/science behind it was impeccable. This is no surprise as his novels typically have a load of solid \u201cscience\u201d backing them. These are unfortunate folks locked in their own bodies as they do horrible things. Reading the zombie POV sections were particularly painful to this reader\u2019s soul.Dead of Night also failed to use the word zombie for nearly half the book. Characters such as Officer Dez Fox, her partner JT and others spend much of the book trying to figure out what the hell is happening. The novel itself follows a short time frame, as the infection spreads through a small community who never once think \u201czombies are real\u201d because who in their right mind would jump to that conclusion in an emergency\u2026 This lack of the Zed word actually escalated the plot a fair amount. I found myself talking to the book, telling the characters that they were being stupid and to \u2018smarten up, it is a goddamn zombie\u201d. The characters never listened to me. They eventually figure it out themselves, but only after they follow a reasonable and realistic learning curve fraught with \u201cthis is just not possible\u201d moments.An excellent and gripping novel.

But, finally, a novel that does the genre just right. \"Dead of Night\" is an intense, visceral, non-stop read. And, scary in that, the premise almost makes the scenario seem possible.  There are a few drawbacks in this one. The lead character, Desdemona Fox, Dez to everyone who knows her, is not a likable character. Not in the least. She has one or two redeeming traits, but not enough for you to feel sorry for here. Her foul language is atrocious and this makes the novel almost intolerable sometimes. I can handle a character dropping the \"F\" bomb, but the GD word is thrown around throughout the entire novel and each time its used, its cringe inducing.  The male main characters, reporter Billy Trout and police officer JT Hammond are excellent hero-type characters. I know this sounds somewhat mysoginistic, but I wish the female lead had been more likable. A woman can be strong, dependable, heroic, without being so dislikable, negative, foulmouthed and emotionally stunted. Overall, a great read. One caveat. Dont keep reading right up until you turn the lights of at night. My thoughts and dreams were peppered with zombies all night long. I even got up in the middle of the night and checked to ensure all the doors were locked. And, that is proof that a read is real good."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1575697-rachel", "userReview": "**********THERE BE SPOILERS IN THEM THAR HILLS, DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU*********************************************  I really, really enjoyed this book. I'm wrestling with giving it either 4 or 5 stars but I think it pushed itself over into a 5 star rating but not holding many punches. I love zombies, movies and stories. Which kinda means I've oversaturated myself with them over the last couple years. I think I love zombies because the stories are usually more about the survivors fighting against a ruthless, inhuman fighting machine. This is one aspect where Dead of Night becomes more than just \"good\" to me. Maberry sets up an outbreak of a very believable virus (or maybe I just watched that History channel special one too many times and it feels real) that leaves victims conscious of their actions but unable to control the insatiable hunger that their bodies feel. Dr. Hartnup, a funeral director, in small-town Stebbins, PA gets bit when a deathrow inmate, Homer Gibbons, purposely infected with the virus, gets shipped to Hartnup's funeral home at the request of his last known relative. Police respond and havoc and infection spread from there. I appreciated the way Maberry goes back to Dr. Hartnup again and again so the reader gets the sense of the man he was and how turning into a monster is affecting him. It's a nice twist on the classic zombie and gives the story some melancholy. Frankly, Dr. Volker's original plan for the death row inmate makes me sad and outraged all in one. Volker's more evil than the zombies.  I find myself again appreciating the way Maberry writes flawed heroes. You want to root for everyone in spite of their imperfections. Dez Fox, who could've come out being the stereotypical,too strong for her own good kind of female character has some softness to her. So do the male characters. It's not a total testosterone fest like it is in so many apocalyptic/zombie novels. Maberry adds just enough details about guns and technology to make the story seem current, pretty plausible and give the characters some authority. I found myself hoping that the end of this story was not just your typical \"government swoops in and saves everything and there's hope to be had\". That kind of ending would have spoiled whatever else made this story original. I'm glad the end doesn't play out that way. It feels more realistic, even if its harder to tell who the bad and the good guys are. Not quite a shocking ending but a satisfying one that brought a tear to my eye yet again (This will be the 4th book I've read by Maberry where I cried at the end. I'm starting to like that his books make me feel something, I just have to read them in private to avoid looking all mushy)."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7291253-mike", "userReview": "The good - there were a couple of twists in the living dead storyline I hadn't seen before.

I would never have even listened to Dead of Night (and would have instead eventually read it as an ebook) were it not for the fact that I forgot to suspend my Australian audiobook account. $14.95 later, I figured I may as well pick something and go with it. Dead of Night was that choice, and for the most part, it was a good one.Narrator William Dufris is expressive and engaging as he relates the horror of Maberry's homage to George Romero, which also serves as the adult-answer to his ROT & RUIN series. The novel itself is a fairly standard exploration of small-town America being menaced by zombies, but it does offer two distinct, somewhat inventive variations on this narrative. The first is the genesis of the infection that turns people into zombies, as it veers away from the \"terrorist weapon\" we've all read about a thousand times. The second is the way in which the infected people continue to inhabit their bodies after they die but have no control over themselves as they rend, tear and devour any living person they come across. Now that's horrific!Maberry populates his small town with only a few major characters - the rest serving as obvious zombie fodder - and of these, the two mains, Desdemona Fox and Billy Trout, not only sport silly names but are less than likeable. Dez, in particular, grates as an overly simplistic cliche, who spends way too much time voicing her thoughts in the manner that only fictional characters seem to. Billy fares slightly better, but his storyline serves to uncover most of the exposition, so his scenes eventually become boring.Still, Maberry conjures up a few memorable scenes of zombies plowing through the town's police force and then the town itself, before everyone gravitates toward a central location for the final showdown - complete with government forces who may not have the survivor's best interests at heart ...Though far from a great zombie novel, Dead of Night is a better than average, gory take on the sub-genre. Fans of Maberry and the cannibalistic living dead are unlikely to be disappointed.3.5 Fates Worse Than Death for Dead of Night."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7340124-liz", "userReview": "Not bad. It's very readable; good characters, good narrative. Problem is that it's all been done before and any zombie fan won't find much of anything new here. Bar one thing, and that's what makes me give this three (and a half - I really, really wish we could give half stars because this book deserves this half one) stars instead of a lower rating. We actually get to see inside the minds of the dead, learn about the people trapped inside there, and that ratchets up the horror of the whole thing; it's a great idea that the author makes good use of. The dead become real people, victims who still haven't escaped the nightmare despite the seemingly worst already happening to them. In fact there's much worse to come for them. Yes, the survivors have a hellish time of it, struggling to stay alive, save their friends and neighbors, forced to kill them when they fail, but the true torment is what the victims themselves have to face afterwards. Now there is something that I both admire and cringe at.Aside from that, it's a basic zombie book, nothing to add to the genre. Outbreak of plague, government conspiracy/coverup, badass survivors struggling to survive and foil the coverup, predictable ending. Although, to give it credit, for all the predictability of the ending, it did give me shivers. Nice use of brevity. I also had an issue with the narrative itself. For the most part it sticks with one point of view at a time, but sometimes, for no apparent reason and with no warning, the point of view abruptly shifts. It's even done mid-paragraph at times and is wholly unnecessary. It's a bad distraction and also makes it confusing as to who's actually doing what.Is it worth reading? Yeah, definitely, if you're a zombie fan. You won't feel like you've wasted your time; it's solid entertainment. Just don't look for anything groundbreaking/amazing and you won't be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Ms. Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3291712-ms-nikki", "userReview": "I'm going to go with 5 Stars on this one.

The background to the story is a little different than your standard. A government scientist working at a prison hospital decides that the lethal injection is too good for a particularly bad serial killer, so he decides to inject him with genetically engineered parasites, which will keep his mind aware while his body rots in the coffin. Things start to go awry when instead of being buried in a government cemetery, an elderly aunt comes forward to claim the body. The body, newly infected with zombie parasites gets transported to a funeral home in Pennsylvania, and your standard zombie infection scenario ensues. \tI liked a few things about this story. I felt like the back story was a twist on the plain old tired zombie virus story, which was nice. I think that adding the twist that the zombies are still inhabited by the consciousness of the person they used to be adds a level of creepiness, although it adds nothing to the overall plot. There was a lot of action, and most of it wasn't completely implausible, so that's a good thing. I even liked most of the characters, although I felt like the only thing Mayberry did to keep the character of Dez interesting was to make her female. If it was an obnoxious male cop who shoots everything and sleeps around, I'm not sure anyone would care.  \tThe one thing that kept this book from a 5 star review was the cliches. (Oh...My...God, Maberry, lets use the phrase \u201cdamaged goods,\u201d just one more time, it wasn't quite tired enough.) It also annoyed me a little bit that the characters didn't catch on to the zombie infestation sooner. The word \u201czombie\u201d wasn't even used until the 80-90 pages range. Seriously? One character even suggested they might be vampires before anyone said the word zombie. The dead people are getting up and biting other people. Mayberry paints a disaster story in the times of YouTube, FB and Twitter, but the characters don't have the cultural reference to think that these dead things are zombies? It made me roll my eyes a few times.

It was fabulously disgusting! It's like Maberry gets zombie guts and puts them under a microscrope for you - repeatedly. Ewwwwww! Those bastards are horrifying!Everything starts out in small town PA. But the infection spreads quick. At the center of it is an inmate who was sentenced to death, Homer. Seems the good doctor that was in charge of putting him down had some other ideas in mind. Well, those ideas spin beautifully out of control. It's like an infection tornado of monumental aspects. \"You think I'm crazy?\"\"Of course you are. You're crazier than a barn owl on meth, and you damn well know it. Look at your lifestyle. There's nothing about your daily habits that doesn't speak of self-loathing. You drink too much. You'll screw anything with even a high school level pickup line and a tight ass. You're a bitch of legendary proportions...\"And who is just one of our heroes? Dez. Desdemona, actually. Tough as nails cop with a tough as nails exterior. This is a woman who is not quite dead on the inside, but she's not exactly living either. She's been hurt so many times, and she just never fought her way out of that. She just exists now, going through the motions. This zombie apocalypse though, it really changes her. Seeing people you know getting eaten alive can do that to ya, ya know.There's a host of other fabulous characters. But I'm a romance fan, so I'll tell you there is a romantic interest for Dez, even if she hates his guts, and would likely stab him in the neck if given half a chance. But Billy, that's his name, he's not a bad guy. If anything, he's an awesome guy who is in love with a severely damaged woman. He's a man with strong character, and throughout this book he shows his awesomeness over and over.This is an exciting book. A lot of it takes places in the dusk and ahem, well, the dead of night. It really lends an eerie factor that just gave me the creepy crawlies all over my skin. Something else you only get to see once in a while - inside the mind of a zombie. Oh yeah, it's a doozie. Add in some shady governmental practices (Damn the man!!) and you've got yourself one HELL of a ride. But it's the last couple pages that will really wind you up for the next book.Yep.

For Officer Desdemona Fox, Officer JT Hammond, and Billy Trout the reporter this is how the world they knew it ended. It ended when a doctor decided to make a bioweapon that turned people into Zombies. A very infectious disease, it was spread through a bite or even one of these creatures spitting black blood at you that was full of parasites. The parasites are little white larvae that are born pregnant that keep the consciousness of their host intact, while the parasites have complete control over their body. It all started in a prison with one prisoner who the doctor thought would be buried shortly after his execution. This prisoner\u2019s name is Homer Gibbon. He was the worst type of serial killer and he was on death row. So, the doctor thought he would inject Homer Gibbon with parasites that would eat him alive while he had full consciousness and everybody else thought he was dead. Well Dr. Volker you were wrong, oh how very wrong you were. He did not know that Gibbon had family an Aunt Selma Conroy to be exact. She wanted his body buried on her farm instead of in the prison graveyard. Poor Doc Hartnup did not even see this one coming when he unzipped the body bag to start the process of fixing the body up for burial, needless to say there laid Gibbon hungry, infected, and very contagious. In the end it was up to Officer Fox, Officer Hammond, Billy Trout to protect the children and adults locked in the Stebbins County Little School from the Zombies. They had to kill people they knew that had been turned into Zombies and protect the ones that had not been infected. Desdemona also known as Dez had to face some problems that stem back to her childhood. One main thing she had to face was her abandonment issues when she had to place a little blonde hair girl outside to be killed. She could not do but her partner took the little girl from her and told her to go back inside. Then when JT did not follow Dez to come back inside she got upset and started crying, and pleaded with JT not to leave her all alone. This is an amazing fast paced book and deals with one major aspect of everyday life that the government fears most. This would be Bioweapon Warfare. I know that I do not have a clue as to what I would do, if this was to ever happen in real life. But I sure do hope that our government would make better decisions than the one in this book. Overall I think Jonathan Maberry did an excellent job in writing this book. I recommend this book to everybody. This book is an amazing read along with a must read for everybody else.

I just wanted one good one!! Instead, I got a mediocre one about a guy in Spain willing to sacrifice the world for his stupid cat, one that's a political thriller that only said it has zombies in it, and now this book.I don't mind profanity in a book, if it serves a purpose, no other word could possibly describe the situation better, or if it is really how a character would express his/herself. However, when it moves from those uses to \"Hey, look at how much I can swear per page (Gone Girl for example) it comes off as amateur and unprofessional while desperately saying \"Look, I use adult words, my book must be sophisticated.\"I heard raving reviews about Maberry, so I decided to give one a try. I went with the stand alone book so when I closed it, it would be done and I'd be happy. Wrong.I can't recall a more irritating protagonist. \"I'm a hotty with a body that swears like a sailor and am the self-destructive slut of city!\"When the the defining feature of your character is how proficient she is at swearing, that's just stupid. Maybe the story had promise, but I never got into it because I too distracted trying to figure out why Dez was screaming and berating people during every exchange. Why do I care about someone who comes off as intelligent and articulate as a drunk hippo?Then insert love interest for the sake of there being a love interest, and BAM, now we're cheesy Hollywood territory.JT should have put a bullet in her head or she should have been munched on by Russian zombie from the get go.Maybe 5 years from now when my rage has subsided, I'll try Rot and Ruin. Since it's for kids, maybe it might actually be a book with a story instead of a primer for how to construct entire sentences using only the most five common curse words in English.5 star reviewers, consider yourselves lucky. You got a book on zombies that you got to enjoy and put down with satisfaction. I envy you.EDIT - October 2013: So my rage cooled far sooner than the 5 years that I estimated above. I still stand by my review; however, I did try Rot and Ruin and it was pretty good. It has some cheesy YA dialogue and lacking parts, but it was a zombie apocalypse story that delivered.

Halloween is just around the corner,spooky decorations are going up,and AMC\u2019s The Walking Dead\u2019s Season 2 premiered on Sunday night. Yep,perfect! If you\u2019ve been following the blog for a while,it\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m a pretty rabid Jonathan Maberry fan,so when I got a copy of Dead of Night,it was all I could do not to drop my current read and dig in. Dead of Night is a zombie novel. It even says so right on the cover,but don\u2019t expect your usual zombie fare. Dr. Herman Volker has been on a mission:a mission to punish those like the heinous killer that ravaged his mother and sister so many years ago. A retired government project called Lucifer 113 fit the bill rather nicely,so it\u2019s a good thing that Volker had a hand in its development. When a savage serial killer is set to die by Dr. Volker\u2019s hand,he sees an irresistible chance for vengeance. Lucifer 113 is injected into the killer,and his body is set to be buried in a pauper\u2019s grave. This isn\u2019t quite what happens though. An aunt no one knew existed orders the killer\u2019s body be returned to her for burial,so Homer Gibbon is sent back to the small town of Stebbins. This will turn out to be a very unfortunate turn of events,first not only for mortician Doc Hartnup and his cleaning lady (who\u2019s timing is just terrible,seriously),but for the entire town of Stebbins. A nasty,nasty virus is on the loose,and it\u2019s turning its victims into rotting,slavering spitting corpses that just want to eat,and eat,and eat. Homer Gibbon isn\u2019t quite like the other monsters though\u2026 He\u2019s much,much worse.Dead of Night\u2019s narrative mainly goes back and forth between Officer Dez Fox and her partner J.T,and reporter Billy Trout and his camera man,with some interludes involving military and the upper levels of US government. Dez and Billy have a longtime,fiery,on again,off again relationship,and Billy would like nothing more than to be back with the woman he loves,yet Dez has spent her life pushing away anyone that really cares about her. Both of her parents died very young,and J.T. is very much a father figure to her. Dez is one tough cookie,though,and when the government begins to turn on the inhabitants of Stebbins,Dez may be their only hope. Meanwhile,Billy Trout is uncovering the horrible truth about the virus that is taking over the townspeople one by one. Dead of Night has man of the traditional zombie elements that fans have come to expect,but with Jonathan Maberry\u2019s deft touch and relentless pacing,the story jumps off the page and takes a bite out of you from page one. These aren\u2019t your run of the mill zombies,either. These are far more horrible than the usual mindless,ravening creatures. I won\u2019t tell you why,because that\u2019s a big part of the story,but suffice it to say that Maberry brings humanity to Dead of Night,just like he does in his Joe Ledger series,and some parts are simply heartbreaking. Zombie and horror fans won\u2019t want to miss this,and even if it\u2019s not your usual fare,I urge you to give it a try,because,in my opinion,it\u2019s really hard to go wrong with anything that Jonathan Maberry writes. Horror and thriller elements combine explosively in a book of zombie apocalypse that you won\u2019t soon forget!"}, {"userName": "Todd", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3658419-todd", "userReview": "How does the world end?On the eve of the destruction of one of the most abysmal human monsters to ever live, Dr. Herman Volkner is finally able to put the skeletons in his closet to bed. He\u2019s the physician in charge of administering the lethal injection to the despicable Homer Gibbon, who\u2019s responsible for the deaths of so many men, women, and children it\u2019s easy to lose count.Instead of administering the triple phase cocktail of sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride, Volkner instead introduces Gibbon to a top secret CIA bioweapon; codename Lucifer. The drug is a mix of the Coupe poudre, Toxoplasma gondii, Dicrocoelium dendrictum, and Euhaplorchis californiensis all swirling through the eggs and larvae of a hypermetabolic version of our old friend, the Emerald Cocroach wasp.The bad news is, a little too late we find out that the bad guy actually had someone who cared step forward and claim the body. Instead of being sealed into a cheap box and dropped in a hole out behind the prison, Gibbons is instead transferred to a mortuary in rural Pennsylvania where the alarm clock goes off and he is once again free to go about his business. His morning snack is quickly followed by the second course cleaning lady, and then it\u2019s off for a little walk to meet-up with Aunt Selma.Desdemona Fox and JT Hammond of Stebbins PD are called in to investigate a break-in and they instead find breakfast and lunch pointing them to a bloody trail of footprints which lead out the back door. JT goes to check out the trail while Dez takes up the gloves and fills in for round two with Gibbons\u2019 lunch and we get front row tickets to the end of the world.Remember when I told you that Maberry was good? Well, let me clarify that. After taking home the 2006 Bram Stoker award for Best First Novel (Ghost Road Blues, Pinnacle Books) and 2007 Bram Stoker for Nonfiction (The Cryptopedia, Citadel Press), He thought he\u2019d add a New York Times Bestselling Author credit to his list (The Wolfman, TOR.) His Joe Ledger books have been optioned for production by various big players and he\u2019s firing from both barrels for Marvel Comics. Debuting at ZomBcon in Seattle, The first thing I have to say about this novel is that it\u2019s probably the most uncompromising piece Mayberry has released to date. The sober realities of the end of all things are pretty clear in this book. I can\u2019t really get into specifics without spoiling the un-characteristic twist at the end, but what I can say is that things are not pretty in Stebbins, folks. Dead of Night is no roller-coaster; it\u2019s a pedal-to-the-metal journey through the genre like you\u2019ve never experienced. Expect language, gritty violence, sexual themes, and horror. The book will drive your mind and heart through the gauntlet and then leave you shaken.This is how the world ends. Not with a bang, but with a bite\u2026"}, {"userName": "Christie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1817343-christie", "userReview": "Dead of Night takes place in a small Pennsylvania town that becomes infested with flesh eating zombies after a notorious serial killer, injected with a serum that would cause his conciousness to stay aware once he was buried, awakes in the local funeral home and starts feasting on the unsuspecting residents. The epidemic spreads quickly through the small town and soon even the police force have become one of the walking dead. Over the course of Dead of Night we see the chaos through the eyes of numerous characters. I found this quite difficult to follow for the the first 50-80 pages, but once I had become used to Maberry's writing style and the \"voices\" of his characters I was able to read the remaining 300 pages without difficulty. I liked that we not only saw the action via the villains and heroes, but from the POV of one of the infected. It was interesting to experience the thought process of a character carrying the infection. To know a little awareness still remained made this novel all the more frightening.With so many characters weighing in, you'd think character development would be lacking. This wasn't the case. I sympathized with those fighting for the greater good and despised the bad guys. You won't believe who ends up being the bad guys in this one! Officer Dez Fox is determined to save her little town. She is a character that comes into this madness all ready emotionally damaged. It seems characters that share this quality are always more willing to put their life on the line. I liked her though and her partner J.T.I'd most definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a gruesome (emphasis on the gruesome) tale of zombies taking over the world one small town at a time. The ending of Dead of Night was wide open, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it turn into a series (and I definitely wouldn't complain)."}, {"userName": "Jessica Bronder", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5781282-jessica-bronder", "userReview": "The story starts at Hartnup\u2019s Transition Estate, the local funeral home.

His excellent characterisation, character development, employment of shifting narratives and innate understanding of those foibles, flaws and strengths that make humans so damaged, vital and engaging, light up his books, and bring his characters screaming into life.Dead of Night is a fine addition to his catalogue. Populated by painfully real characters with complex lives and motives, this story feels like a blow to the heart. We share his main character's fears and confusion and their determination asMaberry puts them through the wringer and their lives change forever. As always, Maberry empowers his characters, they're far from perfect, but they grit their teeth, spit out any fear and do what needs to be done. Perhaps they cry later. Des Fox, in particular was a stand out for me. Jonathan seems to be making a habit of crafting complex, strong, dangerous and sympathetic female leads. Very welcome in a genre over-run with screaming damsels.Maberry carries along his readers on a wave of empathy, fear, tension, excitement and dread. If words were narcotics, you'd find me on Maberry's street corner awaiting my man for another fix.Jonathan gives his characters motives without judgement and lays them out for the reader to make of what they will.

The night I started this I had a zombie nightmare. I was very happy to wake up after a reasonably scary nightmare as I haven't read a book scary enough to actually effect me all the way through to my subconcious in a very long time - possibly not since I read The Exorcist when I was 12 and I dreamed/imagined there was a Linda Blair/Jason Voorhies mash-up in my wardrobe. To be continued...13/06 - Another reviewer mentioned something about finding this cheesy and that they were expecting to see someone \"Asta la vista\" everyone at the turn of every page. That was one of the things I liked about this book. It was like a great Arnie/Stallone/Willis action movie with gun fights, gore, and tough guy/girl police who have a repertoire of great one-liners but also have a heart (hidden deep though they may be) and aren't afraid to shed a tear (but only one, anymore would make them sissies). I think this would make a great movie, kind of Outbreak like, but with the zombie virus instead of a haemorrhagic mutated-ebola virus that while gory (for an M rated movie) was not all that deadly. Outbreak even had the crazed military general ready to exterminate the whole town to stop the spread of the virus. I would go to the movies to see that. Well, if the movie fantasy doesn't happen at least I've got the sequel to look forward to."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "Dead of Night is pretty much exactly what I expected \u2013 instant action, great characters, government conspiracy and zombies by the truck-load. I was instantly drawn in, for the reasons above, but also due to the inclusion of a serial killer which added a chilling twist, and the relationship between the characters of Dez, JT and Billy. The science behind the infection is well laid out and easy to understand whilst being an integral part of the story. There is a military/government influence in the book, but it is an important part of the story and doesn\u2019t become overwhelming if it isn\u2019t really your thing.Dez is a great character, with baggage, attitude and brains, which makes her a little hard to like to begin with but as the book progresses more of her past is revealed and gives insight into the way she behaves and the choices she makes. Her interaction with the other major and minor characters is believable and the dialogue is well-written.Dead of Night is a full on zombie book \u2013 there\u2019s no holding back on the descriptions of zombie attacks, and the atmosphere is truly dark and terrifying.

It actually reminds me a bit of a documentary my husband and I watched explaining how the zombie apocalypse is possible. A strain of disease that's aggressive... do I think it's possible, nah... but what was fun about watching it/reading this, was maybe seeing how the science of it was completely possible.I won't get too much into it. Let's just say that this zombie is created in a lab, by a man filled with vengeance. Dead of Night actually takes you through the very first bitten, through the desecration of the entire town. One bite after another, all in the course of one day. Despite how fast paced it sounds, the first half was rather slow. There are many POV's but for the most part were following Desdemona Fox and her ex Billy Trout. Dez is a cop with the Stebbens PD, and Trout is a respected journalist. (Shades of Feed, huh? Dez would be your Irwin and Trout would be your Newsie.) I personally enjoyed reading about Trout, because that's where you got your backstory. Dez was where the action was. The second half was action packed, and even brought out the waterworks.Overall, good book.

The first novel of that was very good, but once he got into a romantic angle in the second book, it was so pedestrian that it almost made me physically ill.But, it was becoming evident that he was vastly improving since then, so I stuck this one on the list.I was on vacation in Cancun last week and thought this would be a fun beach read.
