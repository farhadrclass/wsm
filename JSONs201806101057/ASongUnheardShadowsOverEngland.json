I never ever want them to end!! RTC (after I write a review for the first one lawl)REVIEW:I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my review... thanks, Publishers!Well well well, look what we have here: ANOTHER BOOK REVIEW! I'm super duper excited to talk/fangirl about this book because lemme tell ya something... it was just as amazing and precious as the first book in this serious and I was literally on a book-hangover for the longest time because of it. I'm gonna try to condense a little bit more in this review than in the last one, so this should be interesting :) BLURB:Willa Forsythe is both a violin prodigy and top-notch thief, which make her the perfect choice for a crucial task at the outset of World War I\u2014to steal a cipher from a famous violinist currently in Wales. Lukas De Wilde has enjoyed the life of fame he's won\u2014until now when being recognized nearly gets him killed. Everyone wants the key to his father's work as a cryptologist. And Lukas fears that his mother and sister, who have vanished in the wake of the German invasion of Belgium, will pay the price. The only light he finds is in meeting the intriguing Willa Forsythe.But danger presses in from every side, and Willa knows what Lukas doesn't\u2014that she must betray him and find that cipher or her own family will pay the price as surely as his has.- r e v i e w -5 stars This was very much like the previous book, A Name Unknown, in that it was absolutely thrilling, sweet, and invigorating all at once. This series has captured my heart, the plots, characters, themes and all. Just perfection. I am not going to rant in this post. I promise. This book deserves that much :)- b e a u t i f u l - t h i n g s -the characters - Probably one of the biggest reasons I love these books so blasted much is because the characters are just irresistible. I can literally relate so much with Willa (and Rosemary from the first book) and it is just an AMAZING thing when the reader can relate to the characters. Just like magic. Willa is basically me, not even lyingSHE WAS A VIOLINIST PRODIGY WITH A LOT OF SASS. And that just endeared her to me even more than before. Her passion for music was something that was so just HER nature, it wasn't professional, wasn't an obligation, it was just a part of who she was, and I loved seeing that kind of musician enthusiasm. It's just so invigorating.I cannot tell you how much of me I saw in Willa, it was freaky but awesome. She was... she was great. Snobby, salty, stubborn, musical, independent. She was a lot like Rosemary, but with her own streak and it was just so satisfying. Probably one thing that was really different from her sister was the fact that she really wasn't that awkward. Like, with people, Rosemary always had to think a certain amount to see how she needed to be around them; but Willa was less like that and a little bit riskier. IT WAS EXCITING. Nothing about her was dull and I just had so much fun reading about her!Now Lukas... he was a special kind of charmingHE WAS MISCHIEF AND LAUGHTER AND CHARM AND IT WAS GREAT. If I can just marry Lukas, that'd be even better. This dude made me laugh (literally) out loud so many times, I had to train myself to not burst out laughing when I was in a room with other people... or by myself for that matter, because either way, I look odd. OH WELL. Deal with it, non-readers xPLukas was a classical violinist, so his was a bit more career-ish. BUT DUDE. He was still awesome and knowledgeable and passionate, maybe not the same as Willa, but not all musicians are the same. The thing about Lukas that really made me love him was his cheesy sense of humor but also how intentional he was... about everything. He's the kind of guy that I'd totally enjoy in my inner circle LOL. He was also very extroverted, which was different from Peter in the first book. Where Willa was snobby, he was this almost invasive person and it was just entertaining to watch. OH DUDE. I loved Margot so much, I need a book about herI adored her spiciness. She was so proud and sassy and intelligent. Normally with side characters, I get a little bored during their chapters; like can we just skip to the main peoples, please?! BUT MARGOT WAS LEGITIMATELY SO COOL. I never tired of reading about her, especially towards the end. I just really really really need a book dedicated to her. Like yesterday xDIt's safe to say that Roseanna M. White is just amazing at creating characters and that all of them are SPOT-ON and bloody awesome. There's almost never a dull moment with her people; they are the ultimate #squadgoals the plot - This was actually really really fun, although it did feel a bit close to the first book. But I guess since they are in the same series, the storylines will be similar. Probably the biggest thing that interested me was the music aspect and the codes. Which were kind of some of the most important stuff? So. same things as the first book - There were a lot of the same vibes from the first book, and I wasn't at all made about that. Germany and England, World War 1.... yeah those vibes. the sarcasm - Let's just appreciate fitting wit for this time era. It's so satisfying. I was grinning like a fool in so many parts, just loving every bit of this beautiful beautiful cinnamon roll. xDcan we talk about how amazing the messages of salvation are in these books? - Y'all. I started crying in this book because Christ is so awesome and he can use any situation to draw his children to him. Willa was broken, she didn't trust people, she didn't trust love, she didn't trust herself, but God's will can blow our minds sometimes. ;)the romance was fabulous - seriously. I ship this ship. I approve and set this baby to sail. They are.... the PERFECT combo: Lukas is mischievous and charming, and Willa is snobby but daring and it's great. And so pure. But fun. Yep. There were so many great things in this book. I actually finished it after I got my wisdom teeth removed, so although I was in pain, THE BOOK WAS MAGIC AND I APPRECIATED IT SO MUCH MORE FOR BEING HAPPINESS WHEN I WAS DEATH. Anywho. - c o n c l u s i o n -I enjoyed this book so so so much. This Christian historical fiction has the perfect blend of action and excitement, messages of faith and God's love, amazing characters with AMAZING PERSONALITIES, beautiful music, WW1 vibes, mystery, and an awesome romance. I'm just dying for the 3rd book!!! And that's it! Go read this book, please, for all our sakes and for my own sanity. Or it will cost you... Don't make me send my unicorn minions after you!! They will not be merciful!"}, {"userName": "Sarah Grace", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59507807-sarah-grace", "userReview": "[Lukas has a very promiscuous past, and while he has a change of heart shortly before the story begins, and nothing is detailed, there are a few mentions of it.

It is an entire melody, filled with cracks and breaks that make you feel you've come to the end of yourself, only to then be swept away by the sweetest harmony that overcomes any obscurity.Willa Forsythe always expects change to come; not so much that she likes it, but life has proven she's on the forgotten and abandoned side of this. That's just her lot and so taking risks with people isn't something she does easily. Especially not with a full-of-himself playboy superstar violinist who's sure he can teach Willa a few things. Considering that music is the only constant in her life (alongside her family of urchins) and that she has no inspiration for fame, why should she give him her time of day and let him stain what is so precious in her life with his rules and impossible names? Lukas de Wilde is, in a few words, out of his mind. People might attribute it to the fact that he's been severely separated from his family, with no way to contact them, and is still recovering from a bullet wound. They say he'll soon be back to his old self. True, he might have been fine with living a life as a rake until now, but war has a funny way of messing around with people's mind - or of actually waking them up to the depth and obscurity of hurt and loss, peculiarly those caused by taking without consideration.In the midst of tumult and shadows raging within and around them, these two characters think, analyze, struggle and question. They have no fear to scrutinize a God who calls Himself Creator but supposedly stands aside while the world is torn apart. Note the SUPPOSEDLY there, because what the characters might find out is that there's forgiveness even for trust withered, there's steadfastness among chaos, there's faithfulness beyond reason. And this constancy doesn't come naturally from us, yet this lesson about giving other than just taking is for all of us.And as the suspense builds with each turn of the page, making you hold your breath and gut-turn, be prepared to hope beyond reason and have your world turned upside down by a hero who is seeing his filth being turned into purity, a wary heroine finding confidence beyond circumstances, and a 14-year-old protege surely to capture your heart.As these characters find a new normal, they will also find an unstoppable and unwavering melody that has been there all along ready to be put out.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing a advanced copy.

BRILLIANT, I TELL YOU. So why am I not giving it five stars? Well, there's a couple of reasons. The first being that it took me a little while to get into this book--it just didn't capture me from page 1. The second is that his-fic never has been and never will be my favorite. BUT! This one is World War I, the forgotten war, which makes it excellent. (And, it's Christian. Which I absolutely love.) I think I liked this book better than the first, which surprised me, because most of my friends said they liked the first one better. But...that's the way of it, I suppose. I loved the music, the characters, the emotional highs and lows. This was such a beautiful book, you guys. Willa is my favorite his-fic female protagonist for a while now. Lukas was AMAZING. Both of them had such beautiful conversion stories, and THERE WAS SO MUCH HOPE IN THIS BOOK. Let me just FANGIRL SUPER DUPER HARD.

I knew to expect excellent writing after reading the preceding book in her Shadows over England series, but I wasn\u2019t expecting to be so immediately engaged or invested in the characters and storyline of this book. I enjoyed the first, but this sequel? It kept me up till three in the morning reading and gave me chills. It\u2019s all about family, however unconventional. Music. Heartache and memories from the past. Friendship. Love. Reliance on God.

White's new series set in early 1900s England by reading A Song Unheard! Though I didn't like it as much as the first book, it still made an intriguing and lovely read.It was wonderful to get Willa Forsythe's story. Delving into her past was heart-wrenching ... especially seeing how it affected her present and future. Seeing her love for the violin and how God reached her through music was poignant. Her life as a thief and spying job were rather interesting to read about. And her family. ^_^ Are they ever dear. I must admit, I wouldn't mind getting a story about Barcley! I really loved him in this book, though he didn't get much \"screen time\". And Margot! She was rather delightful to read about! Very much a unique character. There were a lot of characters who caught my interest.So though the story moved slowly, and wasn't exactly to my taste, the characters kept me reading. The ending was good! And I'm looking forward to reading the last book in this series.The facts and things having to do with World War I were intriguing to me. Spies. Secret Codes. Music. Redemption.The faith theme was touching. I felt a couple quotes that especially touched my heart.The romance wasn't my favorite ... I didn't like Lukas like I liked Peter (from the first book) perhaps? But it was still sweet.In any case, I'm looking forward to finishing this series!I received a copy of A Song Unheard from Bethany House Publishers in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5396610-melanie", "userReview": "A Song Unheard was a great continuation of the Shadows Over England series.

Lukas was hilarious and I loved the way he pursued Willa.The danger in the story was good. I especially was \"on the edge\" of my seat towards the end and just wanted everything to work out okay. The story is filled with spies and intrigue...and you just don't know who to trust!All in all, I loved A Song Unheard. The violin/music parts were great and unique.

The thief family (yeah, I do like them even though they\u2019re unlawful\u2026the family aspect is wonderfully sweet!). The music (oh my, the music! Yeah, the music really sold me on this book.) The WWI era. The characters. The math. I think this just may be my favorite of Roseanna\u2019s books (maybe it\u2019s the music\u2026 it just may be the music\u2026).Okay, now for cohesiveness.Willa was me written all over the pages. She\u2019s a violinist, very confident, not so much into the romance, doesn\u2019t appreciate change, etc. She wasn\u2019t all me, though, because she starts out in the book pretty much doubting God\u2019s existence\u2014which was a fun journey to read. I am always interested to know how Christian authors will lead their main characters into salvation. Willa\u2019s story was a powerful one, with a clear gospel message.Lukas was a very good character, as far as character development goes. At the start of the book, he wasn\u2019t especially a moral character (references to him thinking nothing of lovely ladies slipping him their room key\u2014though I will note that that was pretty much the extent given, no details added). But he had a very clear turning point.And Margot! I loved pretty much every portion of Margot\u2019s POV. Her mathematical mind was crazy but super interesting. And the German officer in her story\u2026I\u2019ll not give spoilers, but there are times when I like my assumptions to be correct, and his story was one instance of that.The music. I just have to make a mention of the music. Because, obviously, this book was very much into the musical side (have I mentioned that already?). I really liked how Roseanna wove music into many of the pages of this story. Being a musician, I\u2019m always a little wary about music in books\u2014I don\u2019t see it often, and sometimes when I do, it doesn\u2019t feel real. But I applaud Roseanna on her inclusion of musical phraseology and expression. It added such a deep richness to this story! At the same time, it made the various characters really stand out, because I noticed their various personalities reflected in how they viewed life (Margot with mathematics, Lukas and Willa with music). The writer in me loved this story.Romance was in this book, for sure. Usually, Roseanna has a lot more romance than I particularly care for. This book was not over-the-top for me. Like I already mentioned, Lukas\u2019 former loose morals are mentioned and there are a few allusions to immoral activity, but it was very minimal compared to Roseanna\u2019s other books. As always, there was a strong spiritual thread through this book and a clear Gospel message. Some people may fault that not all of the Christians were not evangelical (there were priests and mass as well as Methodist), but Roseanna seemed to make it a point to bring out the salvation message according to the Bible, which I definitely cannot fault her for.Sometimes, Roseanna\u2019s books are a little dark with the lack of good morality of her characters (which gives it a very real-world sense, it\u2019s just a little dark for me). I finished this book and realized that I didn\u2019t notice that same timbre running through the story\u2014which, for me, is a definite plus.I\u2019m going to give this a 5 star review and am holding my breath until Barclay\u2019s story. After this book, he so needs his own story!*I received this book from Bethany House and happily provided my honest review*"}, {"userName": "Chautona Havig", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3677505-chautona-havig", "userReview": "In a sequel even better than the first book, A Name Unknown, Roseanna M. White has given us everything you could want in a book. Characters that dance off the page\u2014sometimes marching to the beat of their own inner-drummer and other times waltzing across to the tune that only they can hear. The rest weave in and out with perfectly synchronized movements to the melody of the plot and the harmony of the setting.I said A Song Unheard was my most anticipated read of 2018. Yeah. It didn\u2019t disappoint.So often in fiction, particularly historical fiction, description destroys that ideal of each word holding meaning. Instead, they drip from the page with excess floridity. Loquaciousness becomes verboseness until the story is weighed down with details that while interesting alone, do nothing to serve the story. And at that point, they no longer become interesting.This book has so much to recommend it\u2014great attention to detail without excess verbiage to begin with. Characters who steal your heart and never waver from who they really are. An interesting plot with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing without making it ridiculous or implausible.Basically, I think I have my first book to make my 2018 awards.So, What\u2019s Wrong with This Sequel? Why would I say that about a book I practically begged for a review copy for?Book three\u2014it\u2019s not available. That\u2019s a problem. There\u2019s just something wrong about not having Barclay\u2019s story. As I got to about chapter three, I realized that I\u2019d not be satisfied with this story. I\u2019d need more. Let\u2019s face it; I\u2019d need his.And I do.So how do we fix this lack of a sequel? I appeal to Bethany House. Release that sucker. Yesterday would be preferable, but I\u2019ll settle for today. Or tomorrow. I\u2019m okay with that, too. But today would be best.No really. I have almost no qualms about this book. And considering that I read an ARC that might not have final edits in it, my tiny quibbles might not even be in the final thing. A few mixed pronouns and such\u2026 who cares? You have characters like Willa\u2014someone I totally get, by the way. Wales! The book is set in Wales!And, then Margot\u2026 oh, how I loved that little girl who didn\u2019t know how to be a little girl. I understood her so.Recommended? Um, yeah! If you like a bit of intrigue, a lot of verbal sparring, a romance that isn\u2019t drippy\u2026 Wait. I have to say something else there, too. The romance in this? It got me. Not only that, it held me. I cared about it\u2014as an element by itself. Cheering for a couple, ranting when they are being stupid.There wasn\u2019t any of it I didn\u2019t love. Even the stupid kisses didn\u2019t get to me, but then Lukas had the decency not to require my freezer to get through them. \ud83d\ude09You know what? I\u2019m going to redo my recommendation. If you like Christian fiction with a genuine, slow grasp and acceptance of faith, just get the book. Seriously. I can\u2019t imagine how you would regret it. I just loved every minute, and I really didn\u2019t have TIME to read it. Sometimes, who cares what other things are getting neglected in favor of it. Just sayin\u2019."}, {"userName": "Courtney Clark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12149563-courtney-clark", "userReview": "A Song Unheard is a novel for anyone who loves history or music. Set during the early days of WWI, it portrays a unique era, a slice of history, and the trials ordinary people endured. I liked that it showed multiple intertwining viewpoints-- that of a spunky thief-turned-government aid practically working as a spy (Willa), a refugee estranged from his family and struggling to maintain his normal lifestyle (Lukas), and that of an intelligent young lady hiding her true identity in German-occupied Belgium (Margot).In their own ways, they each learn important lessons of faith. What stands out to me the most is Willa's realization that the loving FAMILY she has is wonderful, but that the love of a Heavenly Father can be all-encompassing and accepting far beyond any human connection she might seek.These twisting perspectives all tell a seamless story with action, intrigue, and true acts of heroism. Interspersed with it all is a romance that grows naturally even while the characters themselves are often (comically) unaware of their deep connection.And OH, the music!!! The music lover in me swooned a time or two while reading Lukas and Willa's musical scenes. I have never read a story that incorporates the emotions and visceral feelings music can evoke in mere words and paragraphs. It was so vivid, I could almost hear Willa's song in her heart. The journey of the characters could be likened to a song that has mournful minor strains and moments of pure joy. All of it works together to present a piece of art: in this case, a musical story that incorporates both historical suspense, romance, and faith.Thank you to Bethany House Publishers and Netgalley for the opportunity to review a complimentary copy of this book.

White's novels, the more I'm sure she's becoming one of my favorite Christian fiction writers. She takes a lot of the stereotypical elements in Christian and romantic fiction and refashions them in new, dynamic ways so that they work without coming off as cheesy or cliched. (which I think I've mentioned in one of my reviews of her books before, but I guess it's worth saying again) However, she also throws in loads of unique material and ideas that are also supported by interesting and lively characters. A Song Unheard brings together a wonderful combination of elements that all converge in the early days of the first world war: music, spies, Belgian refugees, and cryptology.I didn't like A Song Unheard one as much as A Name Unknown, but then...that one is hard to beat. This one was a little more romance-heavy, and I personally didn't find the faith theme as compelling as I wanted to, but overall it was still a good book--and I especially loved how one character who was so clearly going to be the bad guy at the beginning was shown to be so much more complex.

Oh my stars!!! :DYet it's not just their chemistry, I think my favorite part is simply how music resonates for both of them. It reaches down deep in their hearts and settles there, inspiring and encouraging them. The way Willa, especially, gets swept up in her violin playing struck me from the very first pages and is why I, ultimately, decided to bring this one home from the store. (Although I can't deny that the romantic tension was also a big factor in that decision! ;)The combination of connecting with the characters and their delightful romance, as well as the building tension of the mysteries to be uncovered, all come together to create a beautifully written story.

I have heard lovely things about this author and jumped at the chance of reviewing this. I had high expectations for this book and wow, it was even better than I thought it would be. I have definitely found a new favorite author.THE SETTINGThe setting of this book was so perfect. London, the war, spies, music sheets, violins, fancy dinner parties, the little French phrases thrown in. Ah, I completely fell in love with this story. The authors writing style is beautiful and I was immediately pulled into the story. THE CHARACTERS Oh my goodness, these characters. <3 Lukas and Willa were so different yet so perfect for each other. I don't know why but I really liked that Willa was a theft?? I feel like it suited her character really well. And then there's Lukas De Wilde.. the guy who's used to flirting with every girl until Willa comes along. Their relationship from the beginning was so cute, and yet most of the book she was trying to steal from him. I loved it. ;) Jules was also a favorite character of mine. I loved the friendship that he and Lukas had. I also really enjoyed the parts with Margot and her mom. I loved that the De Wilde family was included in the story. I thought that Gottlieb was a good fit to their part of the story, and I really liked learning more about him as the story went on. I was very impressed with this book. The writing was delightful and I couldn't put it down.

If only life were so simple; no flirting, no international spies, no breaking of hearts, . . . . . . . apparently Willa is not the only one in Wales following Lucas De Wilde, and in essence, following her. \"With greater risk, comes greater reward\", yes . . . but at what cost to those she loves?

This is me sitting staring in space wondering where to begin.*takes a deep breath and begins*I expected a theme of music, but this book held even more than that. I enjoy music, but the depth presented in this book made me realize how much more I should appreciate it. Lukas and Willa both dwell on different aspects of music, but together it truly becomes alive. By the end, the song is heard in a beautiful way.To begin with, Lukas is nothing like Peter, and especially at the beginning I rolled my eyes at him so many times. But he is a dear man, and one that was hard NOT to like. Willa was fun to explore, and I loved all the intricate storylines to her character. But Margot probably was my favorite of the three. She was amazing! I was astounded at her knowledge at fourteen, and she made me appreciate mathematics so much more. I love how much she thinks and acts like an adult, and how the end came to play into the story for her ;) Then, there are the bad guys and fascinating characters along the way...like icky Corr and strangely interesting Mr. V. The setting is amazing, and I loved that this was during the early years of World War I. The facts about Belgium immigrants really fascinated me, and everything with finding the key astounded me even more. This whole book is rather shocking, to say the least!The romance irked me at times, because Lukas' attitude is not too unlike other playboy characters, who somehow find a girl that outdoes all the rest of the woman they've been around with (okay, okay, I concede that it's better than the fellow keeping on his rocketed path downward). Thankfully, we are never seen much of his past...just a couple hints here and there. Plus, the girl he picked was good for him after all. There are few kisses, a couple semi-detailed.Spiritual content came forth even more in this book than the first. I loved the progress of it, and how it played a factor into all three MCs. I would have liked to see a little more with Lukas in the end, like Willa, but he obviously had changed for the better ;) There was a good thread of Salvation which I very much appreciated. Now to the writing style...some moments it positively irritated me. There were lots of fragment sentences and run-ons. Grammar teachers would be horrified! But somehow, this author writes it in such a way that pulls you in and in general I couldn't find much fault with it, except that I do love sentences that hold long, beautiful descriptions. I simply can't wait to read Barclay's story. I absolutely loved him in this book, and would have been happy to see more of him!! This story has a lot of depth and feeling, and will hardly leave you without some expression of amazement by the end ;)"}, {"userName": "Janell R.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41065618-janell-r", "userReview": "Wow, this is one of the most amazing books ever! First of all, it\u2019s by one of my very favorite authors. Honestly it never ceases to amaze me how Mrs. White continues to produce quality work and storylines that are always unique. You never feel like you\u2019re reading the same book over again with different names. And her talent for putting words together to convey the realistic emotions, and basically put a painting before your eyes with words. She truly is an artist of words! That\u2019s just an admiration of her writing in general.This book specifically, though (well, honestly, both the books in this series) incorporates elements that are close to my heart. In the first, of course, it was about books and a library! One might ask, How could anything be better than that? Well, I think this one topped it by just a tiny bit. We have two geniuses in this story: one is a genius of music, namely Willa Forsythe, and the other a genius of math, that being Margot De Wilde, Lucas\u2019 little sister. Seriously, in one book two such amazing elements as music and math (now let it be stated here and now, that I am not proficient in either, though I dabble just a little in both, and am a great admirer of those whose knowledge is more perfect than my own)! It was a score from page one!All the characters were just lovely (well, okay, I\u2019ll admit, I honestly didn\u2019t care much for Jules *shrug*). I mean, of course, the bad guy was really bad, but even the less bad guy\u2026well, I won\u2019t give any spoilers about him. But seriously, I\u2019d have a hard time picking a favorite, though I think Margot might come the closest.The spiritual side of the story was quite good, though to me the way it described Lukas\u2019 change was more the idea that he \u2018turned over a new leaf\u2019 rather than that an actual conversion took place, but that could just be me. Still didn\u2019t detract any from the book over all.So to sum it all up\u2026Just go read the book! It can tell it\u2019s own story better than me.

This book is the second book in the \u201cShadows over England\u201d series, but it can be read as a standalone. Ms. White\u2019s writing is lyrical. She crafts her own song through storytelling. This story is filled to the brim with so much to love! There is danger, mystery, spies and romance. There is also a lot of faith content. And one must not forget the music! Ms. White obviously knows a lot about music and the violin. The music lover in me loved reading about the characters\u2014their passion for music and how they experience it. The characters are so well written in this book! They are real and very relatable. I love Willa\u2019s (our heroine) stubbornness, even though it is sometimes to her detriment. Willa thinks she\u2019s never enough, making it hard for her to accept God\u2019s love. Our hero, Lukas, goes through a faith journey. He begins as a ladies\u2019 man, but later starts to pray and talk to God. Ms. White has her characters grapple with hard questions of faith, the existence of God, war, and whether it\u2019s okay to lie for a greater cause.\u201cA Song Unheard\u201d is akin to a beautiful symphony. I love the overall message of using the gifts God has given us and not hiding them from the world. Ms. White hits all the right notes with this one!Content: This is a clean read, besides a couple of minor things. Some examples are: talk of a man possibly getting a girl in a compromising position, a character thinks of \u201cchoice words,\u201d a character mutters a \u201cnear-curse\u201d and a curse which isn\u2019t written.Rating: I give this book 5 stars!Genre: Christian Historical Fiction; RomanceI want to thank Roseanna White, Bethany House Publishers, Celebrate Lit and NetGalley for the complimentary copy of this book for review.

Excavating little known tenets of the Great War while infused with a smile of an adventure you know the author was deliciously happy to pen, A Song Unheard is a complicated symphony at times bitter and sweet and never swerves into cliche due to White's competent pen.

Encore! What a fabulous second instalment in Roseanna White\u2019s Shadows Over England series. History, drama, romance, intrigue, and music melded together in this novel to create an engrossing read that became more and more suspenseful as the story continued. Willa ends up solidly in the sights of four men as she attempts to complete her mission: Mr. V, her employer; Brown, the mysterious German who tries to recruit her out from under Mr. V\u2019s nose; Cor Akkerman, the Flemish refugee who follows her from London to Aberystwyth; and of course, Lukas De Wilde, the renowned violinist, who is intrigued by Willa\u2019s intensity and raw talent. Willa plays an increasingly dangerous game as her loyalties are stretched and pulled and her safety threatened.Also very much a part of this story are Lukas\u2019s mother and sister, currently hiding in Belgium under an assumed name. Lukas\u2019s fourteen-year-old sister Margot, a mathematical savant, is the sole remaining repository of their father\u2019s cryptology work after the Germans destroyed their home in Louvain, but Lukas has no idea whether they survived the attack. Aside from fulfilling his contract with the Belgian Symphony Orchestra, which is currently touring to raise money for the thousands of Belgian refugees, and unravelling the depths of the oh-so-intriguing Willa Forsythe, his overwhelming concern is locating his mother and sister and smuggling them out of Belgium.If the plot isn\u2019t enough to draw you in, then the characters certainly will be. They are so sharply drawn and engaging: Willa, stubborn and prickly and hidden behind the shell that has hardened over the years since she was abandoned as a child, but endearing all the same; Lukas, a charming flirt who very quickly turns devoted\u2014if still flirtatious\u2014suitor, much to Willa\u2019s chagrin; and even Margot in her world of numbers and puzzles, living under the ever-watchful gaze of Generalleutnant Wolfgang Gottlieb.Amidst all of this drama and intrigue, Lukas and Willa are forced to look deep inside themselves, not just at who they are, but at who they could be. As Margot wisely points out, \"There always comes a time for change, oui? When you are ready, Jesus will forgive you. ... [T]hat is when He can start piecing us back together.\"And I have to add a final word about the way in which music\u2014particularly the way it speaks to Willa\u2014was written into this story. Bellissimo!My love and enjoyment of this series knows no bounds, and I can\u2019t wait for Barclay\u2019s story!I received a copy of this novel from the publisher.

But White does an excellent job of placing the reader firmly within that time in history with details incorporated into the setting and dialogue, as well as using key differences to highlight how many decisions people made at this time were literally about life and death. Modern conveniences we take for granted are absent, leaving gaping holes in communication, for example. How could you possibly reach a loved one with no phone to do so--how do you even know they are still alive? This creates characters who are simultaneously different from us, and yet quite similar in ways that matter even more: family, struggle, loss, and faith give us commonality.I love how this particular story gives us characters with very unique abilities. From our heroine who plays the violin by ear to those with crazy math abilities that give them an advantage in developing or deciphering code, the insight into a mind much different than my own is fascinating. Perhaps the best part of the character development, however, is how these people are also shown as fallible human beings, who despite their incredible skills, are as flawed as the rest of us. The spiritual component is well-written, too. Both the main characters begin the book as skeptics, despite those who have poured into their lives before the opening lines. Moments of sharing lead to contemplation, often followed by unbelief tempered with respect for the other viewpoint. The resistance seems natural, but along the way, the desire to trust in the same God who provides the only solid ground in the war-torn world becomes irresistible and a beautiful picture of both surrender and profound blessing. As always, White expertly crafts her novel in layers of mystery, plot, complex characters, and a thoroughly researched historical setting. Add in a great romance and a touch of humor to keep things from getting too heavy, and this book is the best I have read so far this year\u2014and I imagine it will be very difficult to budge from that top spot! I highly recommend it for those with an interest in World War I, violins, codes, or simply those who love a fantastic story!

And the title tie-in is just one of the many details that makes this a masterpiece of a story. There's depth of character, an inspiring faith thread and plenty of intrigue -- not to mention the kind of toe-curling romance that will leave your fainting couch in need of reupholstering 'cause you're going to wear it out with all the swooning you'll be doing over Lukas.Reformed rake. Squeal! Relentless in his pursuit. Squeal! Gentle and patient in that pursuit. Squeal! And full of humour. Squeal! Every time he grins...thud! Thud! THUD! Hence the broken springs in the aforementioned fainting couch. And Willa is so brusque with him but that doesn't faze him one bit. Like I said...relentless. My tummy is still doing back-flips.But as delicious as the romance is, there's a whole lot more to this story. We're right at the beginning of World War I and there's plenty of sinister afoot. The story flashes back and forth between Lukas and Willa in Wales and Lukas's sister, Margot, in occupied Brussels. Tension builds as various characters work at cross-purposes that place the De Wilde family in ever increasing danger.And then there's Willa's deception. My heart hurts just thinking about it. Because for all her bravado, she's protecting a hurting heart. Walled it up in a defensive maneuver and she has no intention of letting anyone, other than her family, in.And what a family! This is the second book in the Shadows Over England series and if you've read A Name Unknown, you'll recognize the rowdy clan Willa claims as her kin. No worries if you haven't read the first book, this one will serve as a sweet introduction. Just love the whole premise surrounding this series and the overlap of characters. I'm hoping every one of her adopted siblings gets their own story. That will keep Roseanna M.White's adoring public in good reads for a long time to come. And that makes me super happy."}], "description": "Willa Forsythe is both a violin prodigy and top-notch thief, which make her the perfect choice for a crucial task at the outset of World War I\u2014to steal a cypher from a famous violinist currently in Wales.
