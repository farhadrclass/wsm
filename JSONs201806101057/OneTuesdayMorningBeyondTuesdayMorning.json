Out of all of her books, though, this series is my absolute favorite. I could not put it down till I turned that last page. My heart ached for Jamie & Sierra, with what they were going through. It brought memories of 9/11 crashing back so fast that I found myself crying throughout the majority of the 1st book, \"One Tuesday Morning\", and, then again while reading \"Beyond Tuesday Morning\". Mrs. Kingsbury has a way of writing a story that makes you feel like you know the characters personally and you're rooting for them to find their way through the heartbreak they're going through!"}, {"userName": "Mary  O'Brien", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6760927-mary-o-brien", "userReview": "** I know I am not doing as many book reviews as I would like but I am proud to say that after 3 years of trying to have a baby, we are PREGNANT! So with that being said, I have been very tired!**According to Goodreads:Based on the tragedy of the Twin Towers ... two powerful novels of heroism, loss, and redemption by New York Times bestselling author Karen Kingsbury. ONE TUESDAY MORNING. The last thing Jake Bryan knew was the sound of the World Trade Center collapsing on top of him and his fellow firefighters. The man in the hospital bed remembers nothing. Not rushing with his teammates up the stairway of the south tower to help trapped victims. Not being blasted from the building. And not the woman sitting by his bedside who says she is his wife.Jamie Bryan will do anything to help her beloved husband regain his memory. But that means helping Jake rediscover the one thing Jamie has never shared with him: his deep faith in God.BEYOND TUESDAY MORNING: Determined to find meaning in her grief three years after the terrorist attacks on New York City, FDNY widow Jamie Bryan pours her life into volunteer work at a small memorial chapel across from where the Twin Towers once stood. There, unsure and feeling somehow guilty, Jamie opens herself to the possibility of love again. But, in the face of a staggering revelation, only the persistence of a tenacious man, questions from Jamie's curious daughter, and words from her dead husband's journal can move Jamie beyond one Tuesday morning ... toward life. One Tuesday Morning/Beyond Tuesday Morning, is the first Karen Kingsbury book that I have read. To say the least, I was not disappointed. The events surrounding September 11, has affected each and everyone of us in some way. The first book, One Tuesday Morning ; showed the events leading up to September 11th for two different families. Jamie Byran was a wife of a firefighter, Jake and they had a daughter, Sierra. Eric was an overly dedicated business man who let work take over his life. Eric was married to Laura and they had a son, Josh. I couldn't seem to put this book down! I could visualize being in the towers. I could also visualize the pain and heartache that these two wives had in common. God played a huge role in these families overcoming a tragic event.The second book, Beyond Tuesday Morning; was about choosing to live. Jamie can remember the day just like it was yesterday. She has to make a choice to either live in the past or live for the future. I have to admit that I rooted for her in this book!! I am so happy how things turned out.I can't wait to read the last book in this series!I rate this book 5/5!"}, {"userName": "Sheila", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156879-sheila", "userReview": "The first of these books, One Tuesday Morning was a great way of learning to understand about 9/11 although perhaps not a book to read late at night in bed! However, the author writes with such faith, realism and understanding that you can feel the pain of those involved in the tragedy almost as strongly as if you had been there. She tells the story through the eyes of two families, one a fire fighter's and the other a business man's. Although totally unrelated the two families lives become entangled through a unusual set of events.Beyond Tuesday Morning takes the story onwards with the two sets of families. At the start of the book, the two families' lives have become seperate due to their distant locations of New York and Los Angeles but later on in the story, again in an unusual set of events they again become entangled but this time in a much more positive scenario. The author's faith in God comes through very strongly and positively in these books as a changing force for good and a way to work through difficult situations. A recommneded read."}, {"userName": "Michelle King", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7143106-michelle-king", "userReview": "I am glad I got the book with both stories in one book. Once I finished the first story, it was nice to continue right over to the second. There was a lot more discussion about religion and Bible scriptures than I am used to. I found this book by accident. I like to randomly select books off the shelves at the library, so I had never heard of this author. I just wanted to read a good heart warming story. I enjoyed the characters and the peek into their lives, even knowing it would be sad because it was around the tragedy of September 11. This book was a good read to put the day's events into your heart so we never forget."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1291322-amy", "userReview": "I absolutely LOVED this book. I couldn't put it down. While my losses in life aren't the same as the main character, I felt as if some of the main points were aimed at me. I definately have had a breakthrough in my grief process. When the book states that a person should \"choose life\" instead of living for/in the past, I lost it. I couldn't stop crying. I probably cried through half of the book, but it was something I needed. The loss of my tiny son shook me to the core, and I didn't know how to go on. This amazing book has shown me the way."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1012260-terri", "userReview": "This book was GREAT!

I saw it at the store not long after 911, and because of that, wasn't sure I was up to reading anything about 911. Only because of the fireman on the cover, I bought it. My husband's a fireman.Well, I was quickly drawn into the story. It was well written and a great read, keeping you turning the pages, wanting to see what happens next.I finished the book, and thought it was really good; I couldn't get the brother, Clay, out of my mind. I really like his character and felt so bad for him. Little did I know, there was another book. Beyond Tuesday Morning. And guess what...Clay's back!Beyond Tuesday Morning:I can't tell you how excited I was to not only find out there was more/another book, but that it was about my favorite character from the first book...Clay!This is one of those books that stay with you forever. Someday I'll probably read it again. For now, I've convinced my twelve-year-old to read it. I had passed my copy on to a friend; I thought it was that good.

I found it a little drawn out at times, over explanatory, but all in all a beautiful story that will stay in my heart and mind for a long time. When I chose this series, I did so only because I had read and enjoyed another book by Karen Kingsbury (Dandelion Dust). The topic of 9/11 being near to my heart as I am a NY City native. Curiously, when I moved to California I lived and started my family in the Western San Fernando Valley celebrating my first borns third birthday at the same Chuck E Cheese Laura celebrated her son's birthday and worked a block away from Eric's office in Warner Center.

I had not read the second book in this edition before though. The first book deals with several families and how their lives are impacted by the events of 9/11. A case of mistaken identity gives one man a chance to become the husband and father that his family needs. In the second book, we get to see that that has persisted. The plot of the second book was predictable in that I knew what would happen before it did. I like the message Kingsbury wove through the book that even with an evil event, God could create some good out of it. Some of the ways she applied it, I rarely if ever see happen in non-fictional life though."}, {"userName": "Cherie' ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33452035-cherie", "userReview": "It's hard to describe, I mean it is wow. really good.
