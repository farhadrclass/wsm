It's a fabulous, bittersweet biography of sorts of O'Neil and the League itself. The bitterness comes from the reader as you read all the hardships and slights that black players endured to simply play the game. However, O'Neil is nothing but a gut-bucket Zen philosopher throughout the entire journey. So, while parts of it will definitely anger you, O'Neil's spirit is nothing short of awe-inspiring. You really can't help but be touched by the experience of reading this book.

It\u2019s not really a baseball book. It\u2019s certainly not a biography. I can\u2019t even say it\u2019s a portrait of a man. The Soul of Baseball is so much more than any of that. I guess that, more than anything, I can call it a gift. A gift. Yes. I like that.The Soul of Baseball is the result of sportswriter Joe Posnanski spending a little more than a year traveling the United States with Buck O\u2019Neil. Buck, a man I\u2019ve never met but felt like I\u2019ve known my whole life, was widely known as America\u2019s ambassador to baseball and, especially, the Negro Leagues. Although he never played in the Major Leagues, Buck O\u2019Neil was the first Black man to coach at that level. He was also a longtime scout. More importantly, though, he was a fun, charismatic, and loveable guy who made you laugh, cry, and think.At the book begins, Buck is 93 going on 94, and still maintaining a full schedule of promotions, interviews, public appearances, and campaigning on behalf of other former Negro League players for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Posnanski does an excellent job of weaving poignant stories from O\u2019Neil\u2019s past into the present day\u2019s story. There are also references to past stars like Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, Ernie Banks, and others. And it all seems natural\u2014because it is all natural.Posnanski shows Buck to be an example of how free and easy a man can live when he doesn\u2019t hold onto the negatives in life. By painting the portrait of O\u2019Neil that we see in The Soul of Baseball, we readers can see how much our burdens bring us down. And Buck shows us that we don\u2019t have to be that way.Going in, I knew how the story would end. Still, The Soul of Baseball made me feel good. Buck O\u2019Neil\u2019s words and life are good life lessons that come across in an impactful way without the slightest bit of preaching. The further I read, I kept thinking that I want to have that man\u2019s disposition when I get that old.The Soul of Baseball was an excellent, excellent read. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll reread this one every couple of years for the rest of my life. You should, too."}, {"userName": "Sam Bauman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1133793-sam-bauman", "userReview": "I bought this book a while ago. I really enjoy Posnanski's blog but I hadn't gotten around to reading the book. Well, I had kept it at work and was working late on an upgrade with some time to kill in the middle and it captured me so I had to read the whole thing pretty quickly. The book is really just Joe following Buck O'Neil around for a while before Buck's death. But in the course of this he paints a wonderful picture of Buck O'Neil and what a good attitude he had despite what he went through. I'm sure Joe took some license with Buck as a character but if he was half as wonderful of a human being that he is portrayed as in the book he was still better than most. It was really hard not to get emotional reading about the stories and what Buck had been through even before I got to the ending I knew was coming. Knowing the end didn't make it easier, though.I think if you have a heart you will enjoy this book. I'm sure that if you love baseball though, it will triple (Buck's favorite hit) your enjoyment of it. I would recommend it whole heartily to any baseball fan."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie", "userReview": "I had never heard of Buck O'Neil, and most of the other players mentioned in this book, because they played in the Negro League.

It was the first introduction for most Americans to this Negro League legend, who because of his soft spoken positive demeanor and Sarasota, Florida upbringing reminded so much of my grandfather who lived 50 years of his life in the same Gulf Coast town and spoke with the same accent and cadence. It was those defining characteristics, not the superficial difference of skin color, that made me smile with joy whenever he was on the screen. Posnanski followed O'Neil, 94 at the time, for a year as he traveled around the country promoting the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum (in Kansas City) and talking about the real stories and lives of Negro League players, and he captures that voice and cadence on paper by writing some of his conversation formatted as song lyrics. Talking to a young white fan walking through a traveling exhibit from the museum, O'Neil described racism this way:Funny, You look back, Didn't make no sense. Racism. No senseWhat people do to each other 'Cause of something darkIn their hearts. (p. 158)Racism as a darkness of the heart not of the skin had a powerful impact on me because of the separation of the words on those last two lines. Racism is something dark, not on the skin, but in the heart. Like my grandfather, of the same voice and temperament despite the difference in skin color, Buck O'Neil was also unable to say bad things about another person. After football coach Mike Ditka, a huge celebrity in Chicago, gave a hurried speech in nearby Gary, Indiana because he had a tee time to make, Buck said \"There's a lot of wisdom in what Mike Ditka said. You just had to listen real quick.\" (p. 169). Time after time, Posnanski describes O'Neil putting a positive spin on seemingly negative situations. He also documents long and exhausting days when in the heat of summer and after numerous interviews and autographs O'Neil would be fading fast and showing his age, only to be revived by an encounter with a young fan. A positive moment, a hug from a fan, a stirred memory would have magical powers to restore a youthful energy in a body long old. But in the end, Posnanski and Buck O'Neil left me in tears I wasn't expecting and couldn't stop. Baseball's hallowed Hall of Fame, to try to provide some corrections to decades of injustice, put together a special committee to select worthy Negro League players, owners and others for whom O'Neil had spent his last years campaigning. While never touting his own modest credentials as a player, more creditable status as the first black coach in the Majors and a scout who found some of the best of the next generation, and his most important merit as founder and promoter of the Negro League Baseball Museum, O'Neil hoped for selection along with his peers. Waiting expectantly with friends and visitors at the Museum, in between media calls asking for comments on the selection that was widely expected, he regaled those present with stories and questions to others about their best memories of baseball, waiting for the call from the Hall that never came. Posnanski, now so familiar with O'Neil, not just as a writer but as a friend and \"son\" (as he identified Posnanski to someone who asked who the \"white boy\" was who always followed him), could see the hurt and pain in the slight in small seconds-long signals that others would not have noticed. But Buck remained positive and upbeat and rejoiced for the 17 selected, and even agreed to speak at the induction ceremony. Through it all he never lost his dignity and pride. Months later, he died of cancer. Remembering my grandfather's quiet dignity and last days and that voice that so reminded me of Buck O'Neil, I wept tears of sorrow--and joy. O'Neil was indeed baseball's soul."}, {"userName": "Andre Beauford", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60202727-andre-beauford", "userReview": "Great book"}, {"userName": "Gavin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12310209-gavin", "userReview": "First of all, even though I grew up Canadian, I was raised on baseball.

A man who never got to play in the Majors because of 'his beautiful tan' never held onto bitterness or anger, instead, was one of the greatest ambassadors for baseball, and the force behind the Negro League Hall of Fame. Buck spent most of his time in Kansas City, where Posnanski was a sportswriter for most of his life too. The friendship blossomed, and the 2 toured the country together following all of Buck's activities.It's a lot like the baseball version of Tuesdays with Morrie, philosophy of life from an old man with a passion for life, baseball and jazz. I first became aware of Buck from watching Ken Burns' baseball documentary when I was a kid, and he always stuck out as such an important person, yet this is the first book I've read about him...I so very much enjoyed this book that I read it all in one sitting.I highly recommend this to baseball fans firstly, then people interested in the Civil Rights movement, and even people looking to be inspired.

The scene is a walk from the cab to the hotel. A beautiful woman is wearing a dress, perhaps waiting for the next cab. Our narrator and the 93 year old protagonist are worn out from their day and the narrator walks in. He\u2019s in the lobby now, going through the check-in process and has lost his 93 year old friend. Instead, he\u2019s outside, cheerfully laughing with the young lady. Not exactly flirting at this age, but just a show of appreciation punctuated by this brief conversation, summed up by the opening remark.So goes just one vignette the story of Buck O\u2019Neill, essentially saying that when life is dressed in its best, the fullest beauty, you need to take a few moments to talk or maybe to catch up on where you left behind. A description of a summer in which Kansas City sportswriter Joe Posnanski joined Buck O\u2019Neil, a negro league baseball player who travels the country promoting the way baseball was before Jackie Robinson and many others to follow broke the color barrier. Buck is a man eternally grateful, openly optimistic and resoundingly forgiving of almost any situation. He may appear to be a happy fool as one reads the book, but in contrast to the embittered or opinionated contemporaries around him, Buck appears to be the only man recognizing the laughter in the room.I suspect that 90 % of America doesn\u2019t know Buck O\u2019Neil. Even if you don\u2019t read the book, If you get a chance to see Buck on youtube, take that chance and you can feel the energy from the guy. As Posnanski delivers the story a conversation with Buck usually ends with his saying \u201cgive it up\u201d, while offering each person a hug and who would resist a hug from this carrier of joy?I liked the style of the book, not a biography in the traditional sense of drawing the ever ascending personal journey from point A to Z. The story is told geographically rather than chronologically, with each stop in a small town or a large city marked by Buck remembering the same location in the 1930s or 1960s or even 10 years ago. There\u2019s even a scene where Buck joins Joe in Kansas City for breakfast with the anecdote beginning with \u201cI dreamed last night, I was standing on the corner of Eighteenth and Vine\u2026\u201d Buck\u2019s world is a mix of sweet barbecue by day and lively jazz clubs in the evening. Although not sold as an innocent time by any means, Buck consistently states that the Negro League was not \u201chow they thought it was way back then\u201d. The \u2018they\u2019 believed that Negro League baseball was insulting to the black man \u2013 a baseball clown show, bounced checks, men shouting racist slurs and white kids throwing rocks at the rickety buses. If you want a book that decries the discrimination of the time, you won\u2019t find it here. Buck starts with the thought that \u201cwe had the time of our lives, playing baseball in the sunshine. We had fights and we made love. We sang songs and prayed on Sundays.\u201d The joy in Buck\u2019s voice can almost be heard in Joe\u2019s retelling of this odd journey.And what made it odd? I just can\u2019t think of anything to compare it to - a group of surviving black men in the 80s and 90s, paraded around from city-to-city to celebrate a dark period of our country for blacks. A celebration of the worst product of a separated society. I have read \u201cour losing season\u201d by Pat Conroy that comes to mind as a fine sports retelling of dysfunctionality in the sporting ranks and of course Friday Night Lights celebrates both the community and the absurdities of high school football. But here is a sport that existed on its own where the joy of the game eclipsed the racism. For on the field, we forget, we are distracted by the moment, we celebrate the victory without regard to wars, discrimination or even the personal grudges between teammates.The closest I could compare the book to was a trip to the baseball game with my grandfather, the first game I went to. In fact, Buck, who apparently doesn\u2019t like the silences when meeting a stranger, will quickly toss out the icebreaker to a fan by asking \u201ctell me about the first time you went to a baseball game\u2026\u201d and unlike any other sport, inevitably, the fan will tell of their father or even two generations of grandfather and father joining the you person at the ballpark. It isn\u2019t any sport that will set the table for a father/son talk.Maybe the best vignette was on a day where, like many older folks, Buck was at his worst. A high humidity day in Washington DC. The home team in a losing funk (\u201cI always cheer for the home team, because who I\u2019m really cheering for are the fans who came out that day\u201d says Buck). A few impatient people in line. So Buck takes a break and heads for the air conditioned museum where a lone boy is wandering through. Instantly, the mood changes and Buck is himself again. \u201cWere you any good?\u201d the boy asks upon learning that this is Buck in one of the photos. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not right to talk about yourself like that.\u201d And they go on to watch a video together which ends with a Negro League player\u2019s manager saying, \u201cLook at that Cuban run!\u201d. The child laughs, as kids will do, without really knowing what the punch line means. Buck explains, gently, without cynicism, that if you were Cuban, you could get served in restaurants. But if you were black and born right here in the US of A, they wouldn\u2019t give you a meal. Isn\u2019t that strange?\u201dThe conversation goes on to other aspects of the Negro League, which pitcher had the best selection of curveballs, who was the fastest runner and how Buck would study to make himself a better player (\u201cI never did have much power. I just hit those line drives.\u201d All of the personal encounters feel a little like parables in Joe\u2019s retelling and in several instances Joe moves to verse to describe the Buck O\u2019Neil singsong voice. Grandfatherly in his wisdom, childlike in his joy, Buck is shown in his daily encounters with folks both salty and sweet. There are so many little anecdotes that just put a smile on your face. I wouldn\u2019t want to walk in the shoes of most people, but in this story, I felt like I was taken to a better place with this walk."}, {"userName": "Alyson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2133715-alyson", "userReview": "I was surprised at how much I enjoyed reading this book.

My father also shared this love by taking us to baseball games, particularly to see the Dodgers, his favorite team. He grew up in Southern California. I like books about people and I have a lot of respect for Buck O'Neil. He seemed like a very classy man with a great attitude and a passion for baseball. I also liked the history of the Negro Leagues, which I didn't even know existed. I grew up hearing how I saw Hank Aaron break Babe Ruth's home run record. I was not even a year old but my dad had me on my lap because he knew we were seeing history. What I didn't know was that Hank Aaron was black. Race was not a part of our discussion.

Buck is an uplifted soul. He wouldn't get bitter or negative. He once said, \" Where does bitterness take you? To a broken heart? To an early grave? When I die, I want it to be from natural causes. Not from hate, eating me up from the inside.\" Buck\u2019s writer friend, Joe Posnanski even said, it sounded something like a song, when he said it. He would see how joyful Buck could be. While reading this book, I felt that Buck and I are very similar, we both try to keep tranquil and try to keep hate and negativity out of our lives. I wonder if we were born in the same era would we have been friends? Then, I think about how friendly Buck was and I know we would have.Joe Posnanski, the author of this great book, wanted to show how it was back then during the days of the Negro leagues and how this one man, Buck O'Neil, one of the great players in his day, looked at the world with hopeful eyes trying to only see the world as half full rather than half empty. Posnanski seems to want to pass Buck's ideals along through his writings in this story if you will. I think Buck inspired Posnanski to write this novel. It was Buck\u2019s personality that tempted Posnanski, but overall, I feel like it was Buck personally asking him to be the one to write the real story of how it was in the Negro League.Buck had a way of bring out the best in people, such as one of his former proteges Ernie Banks \"shy beyond words\u201d, Buck called him. Buck was the manager of the Kansas City Monarchs team , and he would say to Banks, as he said to all his other players, Be alive, man! You gotta love this game to play it. Banks embraced those words. His personality emerged. \" I love the game more,\" He would say and it was all thanks to Buck.One of the many reason's why I like the book is Buck himself, his personality is infectious and a look at the bright side of things, much like how I try to view the world. I began to notice this more about him when I got around page 187 as Buck and Joe talked about the big 460 foot tree from home plate at Ponce De Leon Park, where the Black Crackers played. They'd talk about the old Atlanta legend, how only Babe Ruth and Eddie Mathews ever hit a ball over the tree. Buck would bring up how if you were an outfielder the tree was your friend. Buck said, \"when a ball went over your head you would hope it hit the tree. If it hit you could hold the hitter to a triple.\" Buck was always thinking about the best outcome.I like how the book tells stories about some of the great baseball players. It shows selflessness, kindness, & positive morals. If you're thinking about reading this book, it\u2019s a good read and I\u2019d also suggest right on time.

Buck O'Neil is the Dalai Lama of the Negro Leagues. (Even though he died several years ago, I find it hard to use the past tense. He has done so much work, and his voices lives on in this book and in Ken Burns' documentary. Plus no one has taken up his role, so it is still his). He worked hard to spread the truth about the Negro Leagues (though he certainly like to mix in a tall tale from time to time). Mainly he wanted everyone to know that they weren't miserable. Being segregated was hard, yes. But \"We could play\" and they enjoyed the hell out of it. But Buck O'Neal is the Negro League Dalai Lama, not just simply because he was their spiritual leader (and in exile of sorts--maybe that's a stretch), but because I imagine that only the Dalai Lama could have a more positive view of life on Earth. Buck is happy man, and finds joy at every turn, and it's simply hard not smile through most of the book.Of course, you get this quite quickly, but is hammered home so much that I do yearn for a bit more complexity to this man, and not a million Buck cheered someone up, or found the good in a shitty situation or brought joy to everyone despite being 94 and tired as hell story. (I loved all these stories, don't get me wrong), but I yearned for more of the details, especially for Buck's managerial and scouting career. His love for baseball is incredibly intense, that the most beautiful parts of the book are when Buck was talking about baseball (not telling tall tales of Negro League players or stories about their lives on the road). I loved for example, as he watched Roger Clemens face Greg Maddux and the joy he had for the whole baseball experience, and his personal takes on each player. Or when talks about the travails of the Kansas City Royals, or notices the hop in the follow-through of a pitcher, or argues that the game hasn't changedRegardless, it is a delightful read, Buck is a very wise man, and I nearly cried at the end of the book when he doesn't make the hall of fame. If you love baseball, was capitivated by Buck O'Neil in Ken Burns' documentary, want to know more about the Negro Leagues or need to be reminded to be happy more often, then you will enjoy this book.I sure wish Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, Oscar Charleston, Hilton Smith, Monte Irvin and all the other stars could've played in the Majors. It is so irritating to \"never know.\" On that note, if you've read this review, you should read this blog post by Joe Posnanski, which just happened to come out right before I finished the book."}, {"userName": "Audra Spiven", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6062255-audra-spiven", "userReview": "Joe Posnanski defines Kansas City sportswriting for many people. I don't know exactly how long he covered Kansas City sports, but it was long enough for him to become beloved by an entire segment of the city: those of us who are sports fans. The Poz is mentioned frequently and fondly when Kansas Citians discuss good sportswriting. (Unfortunately, they're usually drawing unfavorable comparisons between Posnanski and one of his successors, Sam Mellinger. I have no problem with Mellinger. He's a good writer, logical, rational, and forms strong opinions that he stands behind. But, after reading this book, I understand why Kansas City readers cry out for Joe Posnanski's return. Mellinger is good, and there's nothing wrong with him. Except for the fact that he isn't Posnanski.)I expected to be disappointed reading this book about Buck O'Neil. I wasn't sure how any attempt to capture Buck O'Neil with the written word could end successfully. I am also not sure how long Posnanski labored to do just that, but he succeeded in spades. The Soul of Baseball chronicles a year-long, cross-country adventure Posnanski took alongside Buck O'Neil in Buck's 94th year of life. The book encompasses one year. And yet, somehow, Poz and Buck manage to squeeze in 70+ years of baseball history too, especially Negro Leagues history (as would be expected, since Buck never played Major League Baseball).I don't know what to write about this book. Words cannot describe Buck O'Neil. Buck O'Neil must be experienced, and Joe Posnanski allows the reader to experience him perfectly. The Soul of Baseball is about Buck O'Neil, who - many would say - is certainly the definition of the soul of baseball. But it's also about a less tangible, less identifiable soul - backbone, heart, core - of baseball. Buck O'Neil, who died shortly after this book was finished but before it was published, exemplified the soul of baseball, but the soul of baseball itself is love of the game. And love of people who play the game. And love of the fans who faithfully watch the game being played. A refrain Buck repeats throughout the book is that \"Baseball doesn't change.\" And he's right. The heart of it, the soul of it, hasn't changed. Baseball represents the pursuit of greatness, of integrity, of immortality, of achievement, of relationship - all of those things we as human beings pursue every day in our own ways. And that is the soul of it.The only thing I hate about this book is that it ends without Buck O'Neil getting into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Of course, that isn't the book's fault. That's just a heartbreaking fact. I cried many times reading this book. There was one paragraph near the beginning of the book that I read five different times, and cried just as hard every time I read it. I even read it aloud to a friend and couldn't get through it without crying.Buck and Poz. A perfect duo."}, {"userName": "Jason Smith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1031761-jason-smith", "userReview": "I've been following Joe Posnanski's writing for some time now. I read most of his blog posts\u2014golf and LeBron posts excepted\u2014and try to hunt down his long form articles. His recent one on Musial in SI was great. There a lot's of reasons for why he's one of the very few sports writers I make an effort to read all of their work. Some of it is an affinity I hold for fellow Missourian (Pos wrote for the KC Star for a long time), and a reverence I hold to professional Royals fans, something that requires a steel stomach lining and tolerance for routine, crushing disappointment. There is, of course, a stronger reason for my fandom: Posnanski's utterly unsportswriter approach to writing about why we love the silly games we do.In saying that, I need to point out that this book, while certainly moving and emotional throughout, is bereft of the hollow sentimentality of Albom (ignore the unfortunate pull quote on the cover) or the needling nostalgia for a game long gone and likely never existed. Much of that is thanks to the writer's subject, the 94-year-old Buck O'Neil, African American baseball pioneer and tireless advocate for the players that used to make up the old Negro Leagues. A marginal player at best, Buck nevertheless has impacted how we understand the years of segregated baseball perhaps more so than the legends that played it, i.e. Satchell Page, Josh Gibson, etc. He helped found the Negros League Museum in KC\u2014a trip I recommend every single baseball fan make, it's incredible\u2014and relentlessly speaks as to anybody and everybody about those men; at tiny Kansas towns, to David Letterman, to every baseball stadium in the nation. And his talking works. He, like the writer, recoils at any mention that the game \"ain't what it used to be\"\u2014although he does miss how people used to dress up for games, something I, too, think was fantastic. Baseball will always be baseball. No need to demonize those caught with steroids, all baseball players were looking for an extra edge since the game began. Players are paid too much? Buck will quickly point out that he could have used the money.What's important about the past that Posnanski and O'Neil uncover is that these players were great. Some of the best athletes the game has ever seen, and just because they were excluded because of a pernicious hatred in this country doesn't mean they should fade from the story of the game as they themselves die off. And as evidenced by the number of people that show up to hear him tell his stories, that listen intently to the nineteen thousandth time he's told the \"Nancy\" story (read to find out), I think Buck accomplished his goal.A very good book, the only complaint about which is that I wish there was more to it. Perhaps one day Posnanski can write an expanded 800 page oral history (probably too late) of Negro League baseball."}, {"userName": "Bobby Mueller", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24546997-bobby-mueller", "userReview": "In The Soul of Baseball, sportswriter Joe Posnanski travels around the country with 93-year-old Buck O\u2019Neil, a man who had been barred from playing major league baseball because of the color of his skin, but who comes across as a gentleman without the bitterness you might expect from someone who had been discriminated against for much of his life. Through Posnanski\u2019s descriptive writing, we are welcomed into the world of Buck O\u2019Neil, a world of joy, kindness, and thoughtfulness. Reading about Buck O\u2019Neil makes you wish you had been able to spend a few minutes with him. Posnanski accompanies O\u2019Neil on his many speaking engagements around the country, and without fail, the fans who are lucky enough to be in attendance are treated to wonderful stories, comfortable hugs, and sly winks from O\u2019Neil.We learn about O\u2019Neil\u2019s time playing in the Negro Leagues, before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball. O\u2019Neil has stories about all of the Negro League greats, from Oscar Charleston to Josh Gibson to Satchel Paige, who called O\u2019Neil \u201cNancy\u201d (you\u2019ll have to read the book to find out why). More importantly, Joe Posnanski\u2019s simple observations of how O\u2019Neil interacts with people throughout the book makes this a book worth reading. O\u2019Neil brings joy to those around him, simply by being the person he is. You feel better about the world knowing a person like O\u2019Neil existed in it. This book is about so much more than baseball. This book is about life and how one should strive to live it. Many former baseball players criticize the modern athlete, complaining that \u201cback in their day\u201d they played for the love of the game while today\u2019s athletes are all about the money and the glory. O\u2019Neil doesn\u2019t go down that road. To him, baseball is still the great game it has always been and he doesn\u2019t disparage the current players. It\u2019s refreshing.As much as I love baseball, the most memorable moment of this book for me was a simple story about an exhausted Buck O\u2019Neil heading into his hotel after a long, tiring day in New York. As Joe Posnanski tells it, he and Buck were walking toward the hotel and there was a woman in a bright red dress standing there. Joe continued into the hotel, then turned to ask Buck what he thought of the woman. Buck wasn\u2019t there. Joe looked back through the door and saw Buck talking to the woman in the red dress. When Buck finally came in from talking to the woman, his mood had changed, his energy was back, there was life in his steps. He turned to Joe and asked, \u201cDid you see that woman in the red dress?\u201d Joe nodded. Buck shook his head and said, \u201cSon, in this life, you don\u2019t ever walk by a red dress.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Justin Searcy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8399592-justin-searcy", "userReview": "The Soul of Baseball is a great book that talk bout how Buck O'Neil one of the greatest legendary Negro League player to ever play the game. The author Joe Posnanski asked Buck how he fell in love with the sport and the world was shock by the question. So the whole 2005 season Buck and Joe took a tour of the country to rediscover the love of the game.Buck O'Neil is ninety-four and love baseball and he also love jazz, Americas music Buck would say. O'Neil played during the era were greed, and steriod-enhanced athletes have come the picture of professional ball. Posnanski offer to bring the love back to baseball and join O'Neil on his tour to see why Buck love baseball, he also said that Posnanski was an extraordinary man and who enjoy and love life.The author Joe Posnanski used to be a sports columnist for the Kansas City star since 1996. He won the AP Sports Columnist of the Year Award, one of the nation most top honor for sport writing. Joe Posnanski capture the real love of baseball when he was with Buck and see how it suppose to be played just for the love of the game not for the fame and money, but to put smiles on little kids faces and entertain the fans.Buck and Joe went from cities like Houston to Washington visiting famous players and watching baseball games to see how these new players play now. They also met players who was sons to great players and it was only like three fathers and sons dual in baseball. They was good as their fathers maybe even better and it was alot of pressure on them to live up to their father name and also make a name for themself.They also went to a ballgame in Houston were Buck sat in to watch the stars of now play. He watch Roger Clemens pitch and Buck said he was one of the best pitchers he seen and nobody couln't hit the balls he threw. Buck also said he could see players like Babe Ruth, Josh Gibbons, and Willie Mays out their playing in these young players they got now.In my conclusion The Soul of Baseball is a good book and show how the game changed from just the love of playing to all about the money and fame. The players they have can be good players if they remember the love for the game and leave the drugs alone and not worrying bout the greed of the game. I think Buck wouldn't mind reminding them or neither will Joe Posnanski."}], "description": "When legendary Negro League player Buck O'Neil asked Joe Posnanski how he fell in love with baseball, the renowned sports columnist was inspired by the question.
