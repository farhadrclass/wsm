It was written by Cynthia Rylant, who has written over 100 children's books such as The Islander.The novel is set in present-day West Virginia. The protagonist is Summer, an orphaned child who has been passed from one apathetic relative to another. At age six, she meets her Aunt May and Uncle Ob. The kindly old couple notices that, although Summer is not mistreated, she is virtually ignored by her caretakers and decide to take Summer home to their rickety trailer home in the hills of the Appalachian mountains. Summer thrives under their care, feeling that she finally has a home. Six years after Summer moves in, Aunt May dies suddenly in the garden. Summer must cope with her own grief while worrying about Uncle Ob, who is overwhelmed by the thought of living without his beloved wife. Uncle Ob decides to try contacting May's spirit, after he experiences the sensation that she has tried to communicate with him. He is assisted in this endeavor by Cletus Underwood, a classmate of Summer's, who provides information on a supposed spirit medium of some renown. Summer views his ideas with some skepticism, but is willing to try anything that might alleviate her uncle's sorrow. The three take a roadtrip to meet with the medium, only to discover that she had recently died. Uncle Ob is initially crushed by this news, and Summer fears that this disappointment was the last blow to his will to live. However, on the return trip, Uncle Ob suddenly snaps out of his depression, deciding to continue living on for Summer's sake.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0628\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u062f\u0648\u0645 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2005 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u062c\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0633\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u06cc\u0627 \u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0644\u0646\u062a\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0646\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0648\u06a9\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0686\u0634\u0645\u0647\u060c \u0648\u0646\u0648\u0634\u0647\u060c 1383\u061b \u062f\u0631 96 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9643621790\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646 -

It's good medicine. Heartwarming, realistic, subtle, and funny in a subdued style. Winner of 1993 Newbery Medal. Set in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, present day, this is one of the better depictions of grieving, despair, and eventual renewal. It's also a story about adoption, and loving relationships between young people and old folks.Summer's parents died when she was a baby, leaving her orphaned. After being passed from one reluctant relative to another, she finally finds a home at age six, moving in with her kindly but quite elderly relatives, Aunt May and Uncle Ob. Summer finds a serene happiness in their kitschy old trailer, surrounded by pinwheel wind spinners -- the colorful whirligigs they create and sell.Happy, that is, until Aunt May suddenly dies, six years later. Now, with his beloved wife gone, Ob must step up to the plate as primary caregiver, but he misses May so much, it's plain hard to get up in the morning. The days turn gray and bleak. In a sense, old Ob has become the orphan.Summer, now 12 years old, is there for him. She forms an initially reluctant friendship with Cletus, because this oddball classmate -- bizarre suitcase always in tow -- has a positive affect on Uncle Ob. Cletus understands the grieving old guy, perhaps because he had a near-death experience himself. Eventually, they all go for a drive, pulling up at a sign labeled \"small medium at large\" (chuckle). They are hoping to commune with May's spirit. In time, as grief waxes its way in an accepting environment, Ob decides to \"turn that buggy around\" -- a pivotal moment, reflecting his decision to shake it off and start living again. A sleeper type of story that seemed almost negligible when I read it, but -- surprisingly enough -- it has stayed with me for two decades. Must have burrowed into my heart."}, {"userName": "ALPHAreader", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4285990-alphareader", "userReview": "It seems to Summer that everybody in her life leaves too soon. Her mother died when she was young, and after that she was passed around to live with relatives, to be \u201ctreated like a homework assignment somebody was always having to do,\u201d and never staying with any relative for very long. And then Ob and May came along when Summer was six. Her aunt and uncle were elderly by the time Summer went to live with them in their Deep Water trailer, but she didn\u2019t mind. For the first time since her mother\u2019s death, Summer felt loved and safe. She had found a home with Ob and May, and not a moment too soon; their trailer was filled to the brim with love \u2013 May cooked big breakfasts and used to tell Summer she was the best little girl she ever did know. Ob makes whirligigs \u2013 but not the typical cartoon ones most people stick in their gardens to frighten away birds. Ob\u2019s whirligigs are works of art \u2013 he makes fire whirligigs and storm whirligigs, and spirit ones too. But if there\u2019s one thing Summer knows, it\u2019s that everything good will eventually come to an end. May has just died \u2013 keeled over while tending to her beloved garden. Now there\u2019s just Ob and Summer left behind, and Summer can already feel her uncle pulling away . . . he doesn\u2019t wait with her for the bus anymore, doesn\u2019t cook big breakfasts like May used to and he has gotten to sitting around in his pajamas all day long.In the midst of their grief, Summer\u2019s classmate (and resident oddball) Cletus takes to popping round for a visit. Cletus used to collect chip wrappers, now he is obsessed with photos. He and Ob get along like a house on fire; Summer just wishes she wasn\u2019t so jealous about seeing Ob light up when Cletus comes round with his suitcase of pictures, like he\u2019s helping to ease Ob\u2019s grief when Summer can\u2019t seem to do anything. And then Ob gets a visit from May\u2019s spirit, and Summer knows what she must do to keep Ob here with the living, where she needs him.\u2018Missing May\u2019 was the 1992 highly-acclaimed middle-grade novel from Cynthia Rylant. The book won the coveted Newbery Medal and Boston Globe-Horn Book Award.I've become a little bit obsessed with reading Newberry and Printz books. These are two of the biggest children\u2019s book awards in the US, and lately I have been gorging on winning and honour books recognized by these prestigious organizations. It started with \u2018Vera Dietz\u2019, progressed with \u2018Frankie Landau-Banks\u2019 and hit a high-point with \u2018The First Part Last\u2019. I especially love perusing past and recent nominee lists because I find they are full of books I would have otherwise never heard of. Take Cynthia Rylant\u2019s incredible \u2018Missing May\u2019, for example. An old book, first published in 1992, and very short (89 pages). But \u2018Missing May\u2019 caught my eye when I perused an old list of Newberry winners, and I am so glad I went hunting for a copy to purchase online. . . because in just 89-pages, Rylant has written a heartbreakingly beautiful book that is exquisite for its honesty and simplicity. \u2018Missing May\u2019 is a book about grief. We meet Summer shortly after her aunt May has died, leaving behind Summer and her old uncle Ob in their trailer on a hill which now feels filled to the brim with grief. As Ob sinks further and further into his grief and loneliness, Summer becomes concerned that she won\u2019t be enough to keep Ob on this earth. Summer becomes particularly worried when Ob claims to have received a visit from May\u2019s spirit, and becomes hell-bent on tracking down her wayward soul. Helping in the spiritual mission is Summer\u2019s classmate Cletus; a strange young boy who touts around a suitcase full of photos, and does not find Ob\u2019s obsession with May\u2019s spirit the least bit strange; Cletus never once asked why I wasn\u2019t at school that day. Never once commented on Ob being in his pajamas. He sure had some gifts.May would have liked him. She would have said he was \u201cfull of wonders\u201d, same as Ob. May always liked the weird ones best, the ones you couldn\u2019t peg right off. She must be loving it up in heaven, where I figure everybody must just let loose. That\u2019s got to be at least one of the benefits of heaven \u2013 never having to act normal again. But while Summer tries to help Ob find May\u2019s spirit, and gets to know Cletus better, she seems to be forgetting about her own grief. . . Rylant\u2019s novel is beautiful. I read this on the train, and I got a few odd looks from people when they saw how thin the book was (with clearly a children\u2019s front cover). I bet those same commuters found it especially odd when tears welled up in my eyes and I quietly sniffled through the last pages. That\u2019s the thing about \u2018Missing May\u2019 \u2013 it may be only 89-pages, but Rylant has filled her book with such achingly precise observations of grief and missing, that 89 pages is all she needed to move me. I felt the same way about Angela Johnson\u2019s (Printz-winning) novel \u2018The First Part Last\u2019 \u2013 \u201cit takes a true maestro to move a reader to tears with a word-count that some authors spend on first chapters alone.\u201dSummer\u2019s story is told with the utmost patience and care by Rylant, who has written a wise young narrator in Summer. She is a young girl who has had more than her fair share of heartache \u2013 from losing her mother to feeling rejected by nearly all her relatives . . . all, except Ob and May. Summer\u2019s aunt and uncle were the best kind of people \u2013 they didn\u2019t have much, but what they did have they gave to Summer \u2013 all their love, care and attention was heaped on her, until it almost felt like all the pain she had previously gone through was worth it, to end up in that trailer on the hill with May\u2019s big hugs and Ob\u2019s whirligigs. Everybody should read Cynthia Rylant\u2019s \u2018Missing May\u2019 \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re young or old, this is a book which beautifully and painfully communicates the ache of missing and the hopelessness of grief. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful."}, {"userName": "Pauline", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/967928-pauline", "userReview": "\"Missing May\" is a short book that can be read in one sitting. Even though it is short there is nothing lacking in the story. All the characters are developed wonderfully and they all end up feeling like old friends.It is a poignant novel about death and the depression that follows the loss of a loved one.Summer loses her mother and goes to live with various kin, but never feels unconditionally loved by any of them, she is even afraid to ask for more milk. Then Ob and May come visiting and they take her home with them that very day. Summer belongs heart and soul to them from that day on. Summer's joy is turned to sorrow when May passes on and Ob has a hard time dealing with the depression of losing his wife.Together along with a neighbor boy named Cletus, Summer and Ob are able to work through their grief and find hope during a trip to the Capitol.One bad thing about finishing this book so quickly is that you feel the loss of new found friends."}, {"userName": "Aj Sterkel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel", "userReview": "My mission to read all the Newbery winners continues with Missing May, the winner from 1993. This book is tiny\u2014only 89 pages\u2014but it has a lot of depth. The Newbery winners I\u2019ve read so far have been hit or miss (mostly miss) with me. Sometimes, I have no idea what the award committee is thinking. Luckily, I didn\u2019t have that problem with Missing May. This little book deserves its Newbery.When Summer\u2019s Aunt May dies suddenly, her Uncle Ob changes. He no longer wants to build whirligigs, or work in the garden, or leave the house. Some days, he won\u2019t even get out of bed. Summer doesn\u2019t know what to do. Then, her neighbor, Cletus, suggests that Ob should visit a psychic medium and try to contact May. At first, Summer is skeptical. She doesn\u2019t believe in psychics. But, she\u2019ll try anything to help Ob.\u201cWhat is it that makes a person want to stay here on this earth anyway, and go on suffering the most awful pain just for the sake of getting to stay? I used to think it was because people fear death. But now I think it is because people can't bear saying goodbye.\u201d \u2013 Missing MayThis book is quirky enough to be entertaining and real enough to be meaningful. It talks about depression in a way that\u2019s realistic but not too overwhelming for kids. Summer is confused by Ob\u2019s drastic change in personality. She\u2019s upset that her love isn\u2019t enough to make him better. Eventually, she learns that Ob will always miss May, and he needs time to get better on his own. She can\u2019t cure him by herself.The story is set in a small town in West Virginia. Even though the book is tiny, the reader gets a good sense of the culture of Appalachia. The characters don\u2019t have much money, and they\u2019re used to being self-sufficient. Summer doesn\u2019t have many people she can rely on to help her with Ob. She starts the story by trying to avoid her weird neighbor, Cletus, but by the end of the book, she learns that Cletus is exactly the friend she needs.\u201cWe wanted a family so bad, all of us. And we just grabbed each another and made us one. Simple as that.\u201d \u2013 Missing MayI actually think Missing May could have been longer. Ob snaps out of his depression quite suddenly at the end. That works well for the plot, but I don\u2019t know how realistic it is.If the book was longer, the reader could have learned more about Summer and Cletus. I feel like the reader knows more about the adult characters than the child characters. For a kids\u2019 book, that\u2019s weird. It might be a turn-off for some young readers.Still, this is one of the better Newbery books I\u2019ve read. Some of them are very disappointing.TL;DR: The book could have benefitted from being longer, but I still think it\u2019s a good resource for kids whose caregivers are dealing with grief or depression."}, {"userName": "Jackie B. - Death by Tsundoku", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8952328-jackie-b---death-by-tsundoku", "userReview": "Narrated by Summer, we observe the grief of those around her while processing Summer's own pains. Her voice is appropriately young and is peppered with easy to understand analogies. As a reader, you can easily identify with Summer's experiences. She is both selfish and self-less at different moments. Rylant's writing, however, makes it easy for the reader to identify how Summer and those around her are processing their emotions. Everyone deals with grief and pain differently. RThe writing explores the complexity of grief with the different styles of grieving so clearly. I also love how clearly Rylant paints a picture of Appalachia. I've read quite a few books set here in the last few months and I believe Rylant does the best job setting the stage. That said, I struggled with the details of the story and plot. Or the lack of details. Ob attempts to cope with the death of his wife by seeking to make contact with her in the spirit world. There is a classmate of Summer's, Cletus, who somehow gets mixed up with Ob, and the three of them seek May's spirit while seeking their own release from the pain they are experiencing. There's nothing wrong with this plot. It just didn't do anything for me. And a little thing for me: So much time was spent exploring May and Ob that I felt I knew those characters better than the children. There's nothing wrong with this, as we're exploring the world from Summer's grieving perspective. But I wanted to know more about Summer and Cletus! I highly recommend it to middle-grade readers coping with loss and grief.

This novel for young readers explores grief. Summer and Ob are the central characters; they are the ones most 'missing' May. All the happiness Summer has known has been in the home of her aunt and uncle. May and Ob took her in and adopted her; times were good, love abounded. But May died in her garden, and life hasn't been the same since she's left.Ob wants more than anything to make contact with May's spirit. Summer isn't sure that that is even possible, but she hopes it is for Ob's sake. Cletus is relatively new friend of the family. He's around Summer's age. But he has a way--a knack--with Ob that is healing and comforting. Together these three set out on a road trip. The destination? A spiritualist church that Cletus read about with a medium as a pastor. Will May reach out from beyond the grave with a message for Ob? for May?My thoughts: Did I like it? No. Yes. No. Maybe. I'll start with what I did like. Rylant is a strong writer. She did a great job with the setting. It's set in West Virginia a place where she herself grew up. She captures a specific place--if not a specific time. Which brings me to her characterization. Her characters were human--there's a rawness to them, a take-me-like-I-am rawness. I think Cletus may just be my favorite among them. Her writing was GREAT.Here is one of her descriptions of May: She understood people and she let them be whatever way they needed to be. She had faith in every single person she ever met, and this never failed her, for nobody ever disappointed May. Seems people knew she saw the very best of them, and they'd turn that side to her to give her a better look. (15-16)And one of Cletus: Cletus had some gifts--I was learning this bit by bit--and knowing when to talk and when not to was turning out to be one of them. (37)I can certainly see why it was honored with the Newbery award.So what didn't I like? I didn't like the content, the story. Specifically, I did not like the ongoing quest to make contact with the dead--either through Cletus (that attempt failed) or through a professional medium (that one failed as well). In a way, it is thought-provoking. When someone you love dies--where is your hope? Is your hope in making contact with them again in the here and now? Is your hope in finding messages in feelings, signs, visions, dreams? Is your hope in mediums and psychics?Or is your hope found in the resurrection of Jesus Christ? Is your hope in heaven? That you will spend eternity with them in heaven because you both believed that Jesus is the way, the truth, the life--the only way to the Father? Is your comfort found in the Word of God? Can you find peace and comfort through the Spirit and the fellowship of believers?Summer and Ob are both searching for peace and comfort. Specifically Summer wants Ob to come to a place of peace so that he will start living again. She fears that he has lost all the will to live. And if he's lost the will to live, then who will take care of her? who will love her?As a Christian, I saw the lost-ness, the despair of Summer and Ob. Ob is in need of answers, in need of peace, in need of comfort. But he's seeking in the wrong places in the wrong ways. Summer is young and confused. She doesn't believe strongly--one way or the other--about the after life. I pitied them both. I'm not sure readers are supposed to pity them. I'm not sure readers are not supposed to pity them either.Grief wears many faces. There isn't one right way to grieve. Each person is different. Christian or not--every person grieves in his or her unique way. And it's not like anyone--insider or outsider--can say a handful of phrases to 'snap someone out of their grief' to 'fix them' or 'heal them.' There are plenty of WRONG things to say that hurt whether than help. I think everyone could learn from Cletus--a bit--in just BEING there and listening. (But to be fair, Cletus is far from perfect, it is Cletus who suggests going to a professional medium.)Would I have liked Missing May as a child? I probably would not have read it. a) I was still AVOIDING all books that had the potential for sadness. b) I was certainly reading in 1992/1993, but probably not books for this age group. c) I attended a Christian school with a small library budget and high standards of what was appropriate and inappropriate. I don't think a book with talk of mediums and contacting the dead would have made the cut. But I could be wrong. It DID win the Newbery. And I honestly can't say if the librarian was reading every book before it was ordered and placed within the collection.Christian families shouldn't necessarily avoid the book at all costs. But if you do read it, you may want to read it together and use it as a discussion opportunity. As I said, it is thought-provoking."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (JenIsNotaBookSnob)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28047462-jennifer-jenisnotabooksnob", "userReview": "Well, this is a sad book.

I love this book! Ever since my friend introduced me to this book a few months back and I read it, it always stood with me as a very moving, beautiful story. I enjoyed reading this again for the second time and for many more times to come, I'm sure! Everything about the novel from the characters to the plot to the writing itself was simply amazing and I cannot say enough of how great this book is. I truly do not regret picking this up!Cynthia Rylant is such a good author. Her writing style is simple but effective. It's perfect for children to understand, seeing as how this is a middle-grade book. My favorite part of Rylant's writing style is her use of analogies. She uses things we know, things children can pick up on easily through their schooling, and inputs those analogies in the situation of the main character herself. It was very amusing and well-executed. The story she conjured up in this novel is one many of us can relate to. Whenever we lose a love one, it's very difficult to let go but the fact that we are able to move on and keep fighting... that's what makes living in this world worthwhile. The message is a great message for children to learn and I feel with this book, they could do that. I loved how she kept things consistent. This consistence helped the story flow more smoothly and effectively! Truly beautiful!The characters were amazing! Summer, main character, was great! At first, you see she is quite pessimistic. However, this is through no fault of her own. She's been through so much at her young age that it effected her in such a negative way that she doesn't expect any good to come her way. She even takes out a lot of her frustration with Cletus, a boy from school. But, by the end of the novel, you witness her grow into something more strong and capable that you have no fear about her not being able to cope anymore about what may befall her. Ob, her father-figure, was a sweet man who cared for his wife dearly and was suffering from her lost. He was caring and, in his own right, strong with what happend. You see him rise from defeat and become something much more as the novel progresses! Cletus was just a bundle of joy. He helped both Ob and Summer cope with the lost of May. His outlook on life and his quirkiness was definitely something to admire. I really wished I knew someone like him when I was in seventh grade! Things would have gome much more better for me! >_< May... ah... such a sweet lady. Though never really seeing her alive throughout the novel, you get to know her through other characters and let me tell you, she is one of the nicest ladies I have ever seen in literature! Much love to her!This book was just great for me. It had such wonderful characters, a great plot, and a meangingful message. I cannot even begin to tell you how glad I am that my friend told me about this book. It was right up there with all the good books I have been reading. This book is great for kids to read in order to get a better understanding of life. I highly recommend this book to all who love children's literature and who just want a beautifully told story with a very good message. This novel contains something for all ages to enjoy! The only reason why this doesn't get five stars is because I felt that it was a bit lacking in detail in some areas where it could have been expanded upon. But other than that, a great read! Go out there, find yourself a copy, and read it!

Cynthia Rylant also wrote a short story called \"Checkouts\" that I thought was genius so I was eager to start this book. I started reading this book and for whatver reason couldn't really catch the rhythm of the author. I had to re-read the first chapter a couple of times to make sure that I knew what was going on. This book is about a young girl name Summer that loses her parents in a flood and ends up bouncing around with relatives until she ends with Ob and May. The three of them are a perfect little family until May dies and now Ob in his seventies, and May, a young teenager have to figure out how to get along with her. Luckily a strange and likable boy named Cletus arrives in their lives to begin the healing.Maybe I'm a softy, but this book had some of the most touching and beautiful thoughts about love and family. Consider this, \"I never saw two people love each other so much. Sometimes tears would just come over me, looking at the two of them, even six years back when I first got here and was too young to be thinking about love.\" I think that is the type of love everyone should experience or see, but can't explain in words.May's journal entry about Summer entering her life nearly brought me to tears and certainly would have had I not finished reading it class.A great read that is complex, concise, and a roundhouse kick to the heart."}, {"userName": "Holly Persell", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60234287-holly-persell", "userReview": "\"Missing May\" by Cynthia Rylant is a quick read that I would recommend for fifth or sixth grade. There are some deeper topics and more difficult situations that younger children might not fully understand. I did not fall in love with this book while reading it, but I still enjoyed it and thought it was very interesting. I would highly recommend it to a student who is dealing with death in their family or one who has been a part of foster care that has caused them to not feel secure. There are some controversial topics dealing with interaction between the living and the dead. Therefore, if you are a teacher, I would recommend discussing the topic with your students and their parents before recommending it to them. One lesson that can be learned from this book that is extremely important to learn is that some people are better than you originally think they are. For example, if you have interactions with someone who you originally think is weird, you may need to take a step back and really get to know them before drawing conclusions.

But it's winter that nearly does Ob and Summer in...the grief becomes suffocating. Ob is certain he sees May's spirit and that she will return.

But I guess I must have had a deep part of me thinking about it, hoping to see it all along, because the first time I saw Ob help May braid her long yellow hair, sitting in the kitchen one night, it was all I could do not to go to the woods and cry forever from happiness.\""}, {"userName": "\u0644\u064a\u0644\u064a", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22926746", "userReview": "\u0641\u0636\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0635\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a. \u06cc\u0639\u0646\u06cc \u06cc\u0647 \u0637\u0648\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0635\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u060c \u062d\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u062d\u0631\u0641 \u0645\u06cc \u0632\u062f\u0646 \u0622\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0634 \u0628\u0627 \u0647\u0645\u060c \u0628\u0627\u0632\u0645 \u06cc\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0639\"\u0633\u06a9\u0648\u062a\" \u0631\u0648 \u0645\u06cc\u0634\u062f \u062d\u0633 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u060c \u06cc\u0647 \u0633\u06a9\u0648\u062a \u0645\u0645\u062a\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u06cc \u0648\u0642\u0641\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0627 \u0622\u062e\u0631\u0634 \u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u061b \u06cc\u0647 \u0633\u06a9\u0648\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u0627\u0634\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0646 \u06cc\u0647 \u0646\u0641\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u060c \u06a9\u0633\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0639\u0632\u06cc\u0632 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u062e\u06cc\u0644\u06cc.\u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a \u0647\u0627\u0628\u0647 \u0637\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u062c\u06cc\u0628\u06cc \u06af\u0646\u06af \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u060c \u06cc\u0639\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u064f\u0628 \u0646\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0631\u0627\u0648\u06cc \u0686\u0631\u0627\u060c \u062e\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u06af\u0646\u06af \u0648 \u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u0645. \u0648 \u06a9\u0644\u06cc\u062a\u0648\u0633 \u0647\u0645\u060c \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0645 \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0648 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0631\u0627\u0648\u06cc \u0648 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u062f \u0648 \u062d\u0631\u0635 \u062f\u0631\u0622\u0631.\u0648 \u06a9\u0644 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062f\u0631 \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u0634\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0644\u062e\u0631\u0647 \u0641\u0647\u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0634\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0637 \u0631\u0648 \u067e\u0630\u06cc\u0631\u0641\u062a \u0648 \u06a9\u0646\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u0645\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc. \u0648 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u0627 \u0622\u06cc\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u06cc\u06a9 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u06cc\u06a9 \u062d\u0627\u062f\u062b\u0647 \u06cc \u0646\u0627\u06af\u0648\u0627\u0631\u060c \u062f\u0648\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0646 \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0626\u0644\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u0641\u06cc \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u061f"}, {"userName": "Mallory", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2743235-mallory", "userReview": "Awards Won: Newbery Medal (1993)This is a short book about a learning to cope with the loss of a loved on.

When May dies, Summer fears that she will lose Ob to the grief that he can't seem to overcome. But, with the help of an unlikely friend, Summer and Ob begin to learn how to heal.
