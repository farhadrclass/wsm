The biggest take aways from this book, in my humble opinion, are that we often are at least part of the cause of the problems that we *blame* on others. The blame game is how we deceive ourselves... and effectively undermine any solution to the problem. We then *need* things to go wrong in order for us to feel justified in that blame --- that's not a very easy truth reconcile oneself with. You come away from this book not self-condemning, but enlightened, and with a renewed vigor in trying to mend personal relationships, and thence professional ones. This book *can be* deeply good for not only yourself, but for all of those who surround you. Read it, understand it, think about it, live it, and then pass it along to those around."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3079497-erin", "userReview": "Good principles, a good teaching tool for organizations, but painful to get through.I assume the story format is aimed to make the read easier to get through and understand, but instead it felt like a local TV commercial with a bad script. I would prefer that the narrator was straight, to-the-point and speaking to the reader. Examples are helpful, but following Tom's slow learning process made me feel like I was in a math class that I was too advanced for, ready to move on to the more complicated stuff but being held back by other students.The box metaphor also began to irk me. In certain sections, I wrote a note to myself to replace \"in the box\" with \"acting like a selfish jerk\" and \"out of the box\" with \"being considerate of other people.\" I just wanted to be spoken to in real terms. The box metaphor and story format will hopefully be condusive to a group discussion among team members of an organization, but if you are reading on your own to improve your relationship skills at work, there must be something better."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134400-kim", "userReview": "I know a lot of people who really love this book.

I've known about these Arbinger books for years, but only recently read them. Last year I read Anatomy of Peace and figured it made sense to close the circle on the \"box\" and read the book that started the whole Arbinger/Self-Deception/Leadership thing. A quick background (I talk about this a bit in my Anatomy of Peace review): I know C. Terry Warner's family. I actually went to a private, prep school in Provo, Utah with both C. Terry Warner's kids and Steven R. Covey's kids (all we needed was Clayton Christensen's kids and we would have had a full set). The school was amazing. I didn't realize at the time that I was learning French and pre-Calc among the progeny of Leadership Gurus. First, let me back up. You might never even recognize C. Terry Warner's name while reading this book. He isn't mentioned anywhere in the book directly. It has, however, his philosophical fingerprints all over it. The book isn't written by one person, but rather by an organization (Arbinger Institute) that was founded by Dr. Warner. It builds on C. Terry Warner's ideas of self-deception, human emotions, and organizational performance. C. Terry Warner is a PhD in philosophy and taught for years at BYU so it is natural that the foundations of a lot of Arbinger (a company he founded) is centered around philosophy, theology, and psychology. This book focuses on self-deception, and how treating people as objects and not people, and self-betrayal (not acting on our impulse to help others), hurts families, organizations, and individuals. I think the ideas in this book are sound. I wasn't, however, a fan of the terms \"in the box\" or \"out of the box\". I understand why they used it (simplicity, visually instructive, intuitive), but it also seemed a bit too simplistic (maybe that is what today's business demand?) and confusing (for years people have used the cliche \"thinking outside the box\" which is a completely different idea). Anyway, I generally hate self-help and corporate leadership books. I do, however, have a soft spot for the Arbinger books, and do find them to be a bit more useful than most. Part of the reason I liked, yet am still also a bit conflicted about it, fits into a term coined by my friend Nathaniel. He called Arbinger and Covey books a sub-genre of \"covertly religious business books\". Some of the stories were familiar to me locally. Some concepts seemed, like Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change, to repackage theological and ethical arguments I am very familiar with. Again, some of that may come from where I grew up, and the kids I was hanging with."}, {"userName": "Antoinette Perez", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1363136-antoinette-perez", "userReview": "Really struggled with this book, and I see from the average rating that I'm in the minority here. The contrived fable format... the condescending, read-my-mind closed question interrogations... the shallow introspection... the insistence on the reader forgetting what he or she knows about the phrases \"in the box\" and \"out of the box\" to adopt a new meaning just for this book... long-winded (pages-long) pseudo-explanations of new concepts and jargon that only muddy the waters more, like this excerpt:\u201cBy blaming, I invite others to get in the box, and they then blame me for blaming them unjustly. But because, while I\u2019m in the box, I feel justified in blaming them, I feel that their blame is unjust and blame them even more. But of course, while they\u2019re in the box they feel justified in blaming me and feel that my further blame is unjust. So they blame me even more. And so on. So, by being in the box, I invite others to be in the box in response. And others, be being in the box in response, invite me to stay in the box.\u201d\nSay what?!\n Maybe another way of saying that is, \"Blame often creates a self-perpetuating victim spiral.\"More than anything else, it embarrasses me that the moral of the story, as far as I can tell, is that businesspeople need to remember to treat other people like humans, with respect and care. Is it the state of business today that leaders need this heavy-handed reminder?"}, {"userName": "Laura Broder", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1338441-laura-broder", "userReview": "READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW.I'm serious.I'm not really into management books, but this one was recommended to me by a friend and mentor who I respect immensely. She gave me her copy months and months ago, and boy do I wish I picked it up sooner.Firstly, this book is incredibly readable. Though it's about communication and interpersonal relationships, it's not a dry, non-fiction handbook. The concepts the book present are unveiled slowly, through a fictional story. Tons of real-life examples are used, and the story just makes you wanna keep reading to find out the next step in getting out of the box. I flew through this book in a couple of days.I won't try to explain the concepts presented in this book; you really need to read it. But suffice it to say that they have changed the way I look at myself and others close to me. I am SO in the box most of the time, and it's time that I got out. I look forward to putting the concepts presented in this book into practice. I know my family, friends, and co-workers will appreciate it."}, {"userName": "Sunny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny", "userReview": "7 stars. I\u2019m on about 600+ books now that I\u2019ve read as a semi-adult (am i bragging? probably, who cares?) - I have to admit that this one has gone into my top 5. I would have titled it as the \u201cpsychology of self-deception and the impact this has on relationships\u201d. I was blown away by this book that was recommended by a partner in our firm. There is a sequel to the book called the anatomy of peace that\u2019s on my bedside table which I\u2019m going to be diving into very soon. As the book title suggests this book is about self-deception and doesn\u2019t apologise for being didactic about it. The moment of self-deception, of a morally pivoting instance can have a cascade of extremely deleterious effects on the individual and those around him / her. Micro decisions that we make in life if on the wrong side of being right affect us and sometimes we end up carrying the effects of these unvirtuous decisions with us throughout our lives. The authors call this mind-set \u201cbeing in the box\u201d. This always had a slightly tangential although part related meaning for me because of my addiction to boxing and I couldn\u2019t help but draw parallels between the reality of people finding themselves in the box and the squared circle in which boxers practise their pugilistic dance. The only way out of the box is to question your own virtue - a fight with yourself more than anyone else, which as anyone who boxes will know is the real fight that takes place in the ring. The basic premise of the book can be summed up in the following sequence of activities that take place when we make an incorrect decision or act in an incorrect way which essentially doesn\u2019t feel right to us: 1.\tWe self-betray: an act contrary to what I feel I should do for another is called an act of self-betrayal. 2.\tWhen I betray myself I begin to see the world in a way that justifies my self-betrayal. 3.\tWhen I see a self-justifying world my view of reality becomes distorted. 4.\tSo when I betray myself I enter the box. 5.\tOver time certain boxes become characteristic of me and I carry them with me. 6.\tBy being in the box I provoke others to be in the box7.\tIn the box we invite mutual mistreatment and obtain mutual justification. We collude in giving each other reason to stay in the box ... and the beat goes one. Here are some of my best bits from the book:\u2022\u201cThere are a whole host of things we can do - things that can help us reduce our in the box moments and heal out in the box relationships. In face this is precisely what your experiences with Bud and Kate did for you yesterday - you did something while you were out of the box toward Bud and Kate that helped you to get out of the box toward Laura. My mind searched for the answer. What did i do? YOU QUESTIONED YOUR OWN VIRTUE.\u201d \u2022\t\u201cPeople respond not primarily to what you do but to how you are being \u2013 whether you\u2019re in or out of the box towards them.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cWe don\u2019t see people straightforwardly as people. Rather we see them in terms of the self-justifying images we\u2019ve created. If people act in ways that challenge the claim made by a self-justifying image we see them as threats.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cIn the box every change I can think of is just a change in my style of being in the box. I can change from arguing to kissing. I can change from ignoring someone to going out of my way to shower that person with attention but whatever changes I think of in the box are changes I think of from within the box and they are therefore just more of the box \u2013 which is the problem in the first place. Others remain objects to me.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cYou can\u2019t get out of the box by trying to focus on yourself which is what you do when you try to change your behaviour in the box.\u201d\u2022\u201cIn the box i'm actively resisting what the humanity of others calls me to do for them.\u201d\u2022\u201cThis is why the way out of the box is always right before our eyes - because the people were resisting are right before our eyes. We can stop betraying ourselves towards them - we can stop resisting them.\u201d"}, {"userName": "VR", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1264519-vr", "userReview": "A book that teaches powerful principles that I have already begun implementing to great effect in my own life. The principles we already know for the most part, and the general truths don't surprise, but The Arbinger Institute has blended and crafted them in such a way as to help us really put it all together. My favorite and most meaningful insight is that when we are \"in the box\" it doesn't matter what we do, how helpful or good we try to be, we will end up defeating ourselves.

The Arbinger Institute reveals the new thoughts and debunks false notions around leadership. The best leadership and business books weave the concepts into a story rather than disseminate them in dry abstract paragraphs. Try as it may, abstraction always comes short of making us engage and anticipate the the way a good story does - and few other styles make the concepts more lasting in our memory bank. It is within the context of a good story that true learning happens.At the core of the book, he introduces us the concept of the Box - Being in the Box and Getting out of the Box. In this context, the Box represents the mental borders we draw around ourselves, to protect ourselves, to set us apart from rest of the world and justify our own actions. Bud explains in these sessions that we see others more or less as people only when we are out of the box - and we see them in a systematically distorted way, as mere objects in his words, when we are in the box. \"We can be hard and invite productivity and commitment, or we can be hard and invite resistance and ill will. The choice is whether we do it while in the box or out of the box.\" It alludes to something deeper than behavior that determines our influence on others.In acting contrary to one's own sense of what is appropriate, we learn, one betrays his own sense of how he should be toward another person. That is self-betrayal. The choice is whether to honor the sense or to betray it. According to Bud, \"When I betray myself, I see the world in a way that justifies my self-betrayal and my view of reality becomes distorted, then I enter the box.\" Put another way, when I betray myself, I:Inflate others' faultsInflate own virtueInflate the value of things that justify my self-betrayalBlame othersThe latter part of the book, which guides us into Getting out of the Box and exercising leadership in the liberated box-free world, we share in our hero's confusion in how the usual remedies fail here. This is where new leadership concepts are born and revealed. Getting out of the Box is only possible when we know well the problem with being in the box.If you read only one business book, this would be among my top recommendations.

I guess I read a book called \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" or something when I was a missionary that wasn't even covert. There's also all the religious subtext of books like The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change. Anyway, this book is in that category. What it does is reformulate some basic concepts of spiritual / ethical living in totally secular language, and in so doing it actually does a pretty amazing job of conveying some really first-rate, post-modern Christianity in simple terms.I say \"post-modern\" because the central idea of the book is that we are capable of self-deception. We don't know our own motives and--worse than that--we often contradict our own assumed goals. Here's the basic thesis:1. Everyone has a basic desire to treat other people as people (rather than means to ends)2. Everyone violates that basic desire at some point or other.3. When that happens, we immediately seek to justify our own self-betrayal by inventing a fictitious narrative to justify it. Namely, we (a) accentuate / fabricate negative characteristics of the person we didn't treat right and (b) we accentuate / fabricate positive characteristics of ourselves.This is called, in the book, \"being in the box.\" Weird expression, and I never got it, but whatever.4. When we're in the box, we actually need other people to behave badly because it validates our narrative that we're saintly victims and they're powerful villains.5. As a result, you can get into a vicious cycle with people you live or work with, where both of you are sabotaging the other while pretending to be helpful.It's actually amazingly close to some theories I've written about myself (in an overtly religious venue), and maybe that's why I'm so partial to it. Anway, I really, really liked it, and I'm impressed even if I'm not convinced that it's really that applicable to a business context.

However, two things keep me from giving this book a higher rating.First, the story the authors use to introduce these core ideas to the reader could have been much shorter with higher impact. See Patrick Lencioni's business fables for an example of that. Second, two key terms in the book -- \"in the box\" and \"self-betrayal\" -- are not good fits for what the authors are describing. And these terms are used throughout the book and more frequently than any others. What the authors describe as \"self-betrayal\" is actually about how we think about, respond to and act toward others. \"Self-focus\" or \"defensive\" or a term that was more about betraying others would have been more fitting. I had a hard time getting past the misuse of \"self-betrayal\" and almost gave up on the book because of it. Meanwhile being \"in the box\" toward someone else doesn't give a picture that aligns with the outward attitudes and actions the authors describe. Given this book has been around for a while, it is probably too late to change either of these terms. Leadership and Self Deception loses a lot of its potential impact, because it is longer than need be and not as clear as it could be.

And it's like reading beautiful ideas of philosophy (rooted in Buber's concept of I and Thou) and then speaking them through corporate speech. \"Getting out of the box will help our company's bottom line.\" It's a prostituting of some great concepts.

WHAT is this fantasy-story-loving girl doing reading a book that demands shelving on the business/psychology shelf? And a valid question it is. I would never in one thousand years have picked it up if my dearly beloved husband hadn't read it first and told me that it changed his life. Changed it to the point where I am SEEING him look at the world in a different way. And when my husband, who has watched me read for 11+ years now and has never once asked me to read something, asks me to read this book, what can I say?I read it, and I can see why he asked me to. This book will make you feel like a weasel on one hand, recognizing that so much of our interactions with others are the results of our own decisions to do or not do what we know is the \"right\" thing to do. But on the other hand, you recognize the potential within you to just CHANGE things - change the way you interact with the people you care about the most.The writing style is readable - it's conversational with lots of real-life examples. Probably for someone used to reading business/self-help books it would be a breeze to read. For inexperienced me, though, it made my brain work hard and I still keep having to ask my husband questions about how to apply the ideas. I think that it will take time (and probably some re-reading) to use the jargon effectively in my mind - phrase like \"self-betrayal\" and \"being in the box\" still don't roll off the tongue, if you know what I mean. But I do know what it feels like when I start seeing myself as the \"good mom\" dealing with my \"my crabby kids.\" And I don't like that me.
