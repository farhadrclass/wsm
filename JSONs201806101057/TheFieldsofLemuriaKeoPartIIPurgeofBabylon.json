Action packed..Never a dull moment with Keo!! Loved it!! Can't wait for The Fires of Alantis!"}, {"userName": "Amanda Thames", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4453327-amanda-thames", "userReview": "I was still a little peeved starting this book that I had to read it at all, since Sisavath doesn't mention in any summaries that reading the Lemuria books explains the background of Keo, who he brings in as a major character in the fourth Babylon book. In my opinion, he either needed to work the Lemuria books into the timeline of the Babylon series (since they occur during the same time anyway) or he needed to give us a paragraph or two explaining a little about Keo's background since he referenced it so much in the fourth Babylon novel. But I digress.The book is okay. I hate to say it, but I don't care enough about Keo and his group to really invest in his story. It was a good plot, though, so I was interested in the overall \"what's going to happen\" which is why I read the two Lemuria books in the first place. Although, I will say, the creatures play a very downgraded role in this novel, which I thought was the sole purpose of the series in the first place. I care much less for daytime gun battles than I did for the nighttime fights of Babylon.I also found myself rolling my eyes throughout the book when every new person Keo met asked the exact same question, \"What kind of name is Keo?\" because what Sisavath seems to not comprehend is people are different. I for one never wondered about his name at all until people started asking, and then it was only the mildest of curiosity. It was kind of funny, maybe, the first couple of times but definitely got old quick. Especially because it seems Keo's name wasn't a family name or an attempt of his mother's to rope Keo in with his Korean heritage. Nope, it's just a name she chose. So since there's no good back story and a lot of people wouldn't ask about it anyway, please stop beating the dead horse with the line.There were more of those lines used in Lemuria as well, like the \"tough girl\" and \"smart girl\" and \"then two--three--five more came through\" (in reference to the creatures). The latter is annoying because it starts looking like none of the characters can count, or rather that they're still, over a year after \"the purge\" surprised when the creatures fall over themselves to get to humans. We know it's going to happen, there's no need to count them out every time. Or at least don't count like that every single time. Just leave it as \"a lot\" or \"what looked like a dozen, with more on their heels.\" I learned in 9th grade to not overuse the same words/sentences and I am ashamed for the editors who didn't notate this.Also, it seemed to me that Keo and his group, while on the run, had a pretty easy time of keeping out the creatures at night. This was a stark difference to the many times Will and Danny had a hard time keeping them out. I knew his experiences would be wildly different since he doesn't know about silver, but come on. Keo doesn't even have any close calls and neither, does it seem, do the men tracking him who also know nothing of the silver. It seemed unrealistic to me. Especially because Will and Danny are ex-Army and SWAT guys and if anyone would be able to build a barricade, it would be them and not a former mercenary.Because of these issues, especially since it took me out of the story to either have an internal debate or spend time rolling my eyes at seeing yet another repeat of the exact same line used by completely different characters, this book is only a 2-star. I may read the third Lemuria just to find out what happens when/if Keo reunites with Gillian and because Sisavath is incredible with the plot, but his character development needs serious work."}, {"userName": "Jeff Parker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12766170-jeff-parker", "userReview": "Another great title by Mr. Sisavath. The trademark humor between characters is there as is plenty of action and wonderful characters.Keo and Norris are a splendid addition to the much revered (at least by most males) \"buddy-action-comedy\" line up. The dialogue is witty and furious. One of the cliches of the action genre (book and movie) is the impossible scenarios that the hero inevitably finds himself in. There are works out there where this plot device is overused and/or just so unbelievable that the book is unreadable. That is never the case with Mr. Sisavath's works. Yes, the heroes gets into situations where they are outnumbered, out gunned and just generally FUBAR'd but it always works. Not once did I feel like the situation was too over the top.I enjoyed this story arc and I believe that Keo will make an excellent addition to the Song Island team once they meet up. I just hope that we have not heard the last of Norris. Or Gillian, but I am sure we will find out about Gillian and the rest of the crew. Eventually."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31818781-becky", "userReview": "I took this book, the fifth in the Purge series with me camping and didn't stop til I reached the end. I seem to do that with all Sam's books. The people and relationships in this book are the best I've ever read. Yes, it's an apocalyptic novel but, more than anything, the people and their relationships are why this book drew me in. The banter between Will and Danny and Keo and Norris just makes you want to grin. Yes, the ghouls may be at the door, but you can bet Danny's got a joke ready and Norris will be grumpy. And Keo's name? That never gets old. I find myself waiting, very impatiently, for the next book. I follow a lot of authors and I don't think I've ever anticipated a book as much as this one. Highly recommend!"}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "The chase continues. Keo, Norris, and crew make their way down river attempting to hook up with Jillian at the rendezvous point. One of their party was not playing with a full deck and wound up getting Keo and Norris in deep trouble by association. They were hunted across country by a paramilitary group whose leader lost his son due to Keo's inaction. These were the guys of, \"Who the hell are those guys?\" fame. 90% of the book is this cat & mouse chase through the woods. I came to know the characters more in this second book and liked them a bit more. Not sure how this will fold back into the Purge of Babylon series, which picks back up after this. Now if Audible would get with it and make the remaining books available I'd be all set."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8725926-mary", "userReview": "Oops, didn't realize that I had not marked this as finished. This Babylon series just never lets up. Although I liked Walls of Lemuria better, I still liked this one a lot as well. I think I enjoyed Walls more because of the building the character relationships. With most of the characters gone in Fields, and the whole focus on Keo's escape, I felt it lacked a bit of the depth ( for lack of a better word) that kept me so emotionally connected to Walls. Still really liked it and can't wait to see what is in store for Keo now.

The whole book devoted to a revenge hunt, and again only from one person's perspective? Sadly, it became tiresome right at the beginning and I finished it only becasue I felt I'd be missing out on something in the following books of the main series. Having read them: I now don't think I would. It saddens me to say it, but the Lemuria books were an unnecessary and quite plotless stop in an otherwise fun series.

Keeping up the (very) high adrenaline, action-packing, barely-breathing style, Sam Sisavath introduces a new character that we can expect to play a role in the main series.
