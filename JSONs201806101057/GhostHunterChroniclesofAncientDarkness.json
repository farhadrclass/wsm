I've thoroughly enjoyed the adventures of Torak, Wolf and Renn, flying through these books in record time because I was so reluctant to put them down until they were finished. This one probably affected me the most, actually bringing me to tears in places. I won't say where for fear of spoiling the plot. This story, and the whole series in fact, really emphasizes the incredible, indestructible power of friendship, loyalty and love. I would recommend the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness to children and adults alike. Ms. Paver has created a rich, exciting pre-historic world that is sure to appeal to readers of all ages."}, {"userName": "asdewi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1302781-asdewi", "userReview": "Melalui serial ini, Paver membawa kita ke 6000 tahun lalu di masa jaman batu. Kala itu dunia masih berupa satu daratan besar, manusia hidup dalam klan, membuat peralatan dari batu dan tulang serta percaya pada kekuatan dewa dan roh-roh pelindung alam. Satu diantara klan-klan itu adalah klan Serigala. Klan yang terkenal dengan kemisteriusannya namun kini telah punah. Ya...1 klan itu telah lenyap kecuali Torak dan ayahnya.Buku pertama (Wolf Brother) dibuka dengan pertarungan Torak dan ayahnya (Fa) melawan setan berwujud beruang. Sebelum meninggal, Fa berpesan agar Torak mencari gunung Roh Dunia (yang ada dalam legenda) untuk mengalahkan beruang setan tersebut. Dalam perjalanannya, Torak bersahabat dengan seekor serigala yang juga sebatang kara. Satu keistimewaan Torak dan Serigala adalah mereka bisa berkomunikasi dan saling mengerti perasaan satu sama lain.Garis takdir juga membawa Torak berkenalan dengan klan Gagak dan menjalin persahabatan dengan Fin Kedinn, kepala suku klan Gagak dan Renn, keponakan Fin Kedinn. Dari klan Gagak-lah Torak mengetahui situasi dunia saat itu setelah selama ini hidup tersembunyi bersama Fa.Kala itu, dunia dikuasai oleh para Pemangsa Arwah yang merupakan sekelompok dukun klan yang tergoda pada kekuasaan dan menggunakan kekuatan mereka untuk kejahatan. Beruang setan pun merupakan salah satu perbuatan mereka. Karenanya, ketika misi Torak untuk membasmi beruang telah usai, dia memulai misi lain yaitu : mencari dan memusnahkan para Pemangsa Arwah.Nanti, pada buku-buku berikutnya, juga akan terungkap lebih banyak tentang latar belakang Torak, Fa, Fin Kedinn, Renn, para Pemangsa Arwah juga alasan kenapa Fa menyembunyikan Torak selama 12 tahun pertama kehidupannya. Ada banyak twist dan kejutan yang diberikan Paver sepanjang serial ini. Kejutan yang tak terduga dan tak disangka(ya namanya juga kejutan sih..hehehe xp), dan membuat cerita ini makin seru dan bikin penasaran.Dan jangan melupakan tokoh-tokoh yang hanya muncul selintas di awal seri ini. Karena, sama seperti di Harry Potter, tokoh yang hanya muncul sekilas dan gak penting di buku pertama, ternyata jadi tokoh kunci nantinya. Membuat Anda akan penasaran untuk rerun buku pertama, demi menyegarkan ingatan akan si tokoh-yang-munculnya-sekilas itu.Lalu bagaimana dengan buku ke-6 sekaligus pamungkas dalam serial ini?Pada buku ke-6, Torak sudah berumur 18 tahun. Sudah banyak pengkhianatan dan kesedihan yang dia alami. Hubungannya dengan Renn dan Serigala pun sudah mengalami banyak pasang surut hingga menjadi seintens sekarang. Dan sudah 4 Pemangsa Arwah yang dikalahkannya. Kini Torak harus berhadapan dengan Eostra, Pemangsa Arwah yang terakhir dan terkuat.Serigala juga sudah dewasa dan membentuk kawanan sendiri dengan pasangannya (Bulu Gelap). Namun Eostra menghancurkan keluarga Serigala dan menculik 1 anaknya. Hal yang memaksa Torak untuk segera mencari Eostra. Renn, yang mendapat penglihatan tentang kematian Torak, memutuskan untuk menemani perjalanan Torak walau pun harus meninggalkan klan dan tugasnya sebagai calon dukun klan Gagak.Bagaimanakah akhir serial ini? Akankah Torak menemui ajalnya sesuai dengan ramalan Renn? Lalu Serigala, bisakah dia membangun kawanannya lagi? Dan yang terpenting, benarkah Eostra adalah Pemangsa Arwah terakhir?Ah tentu saja itu adalah hal yang harus Anda temukan sendiri ;D.Saya pertama kali membaca serial ini di tahun 2006 ketika Matahati menerbitkan buku pertamanya (Wolf's Brother) dan telah jatuh cinta sejak saat itu.Saya suka dengan kepiawaian Paver menciptakan setting 6000 tahun lalu yang terasa sangat realistis. Saya juga suka dengan ketilitian Paver menggambarkan detil-detil cara hidup Torak dan rekan-rekannya di masa itu. Saya juga suka pada konsistennya Paver menjaga plot cerita tetap menegangkan hingga akhir. Dia bisa menyampaikan dengan baik aura \"dark\" dan mistis di masa itu kepada saya yang hidup di jaman modern ini.Namun yang paling saya suka adalah cara Paver menceritakan kisah ini dari sudut pandang Torak, Renn dan Serigala. Terutama dari sudut pandang Serigala.Paver mengajak kita menyelami jalan pikiran Serigala. Dia membuat kita memahami keputusan Serigala sewaktu meninggalkan Torak untuk bergabung dengan kawanannya, juga turut bersedih ketika Serigala harus kehilangan seluruh keluarganya.Ah...Paver benar-benar berhasil menyampaikan perasaan Serigala kepada para pembacanya.Tambahan satu point plus di Ghost Hunter yang menjadikan buku ke-6 ini sebagai favorit saya, yaitu : endingnya.Saya suka pada cara Paver menutup serial ini. Ending yang jelas, tidak menggantung, namun masih memberi saya ruang untuk mengkhayalkan sendiri kelanjutan kisahnya. Syukurlah gak ada bab \"epilog\" yang biasa ada di akhir sebuah saga dan selalu saya anggap menyebalkan karena membatasi imajinasi.Menyangkut terjemahan; karena penasaran, saya juga membaca serial ini dalam bahasa aslinya (ps : saya selalu melakukan ini pada novel-novel terjemahan yang saya sukai).Dan saya berkesimpulan, Matahati really did a great job on translating this story.Setting yang mencekam, ketakutan dan kemarahan Torak, kecemasan Renn serta keluguan Serigala yang tergambar di bahasa aslinya, tergambar dengan baik juga di terjemahan versi Matahati.Saya bahkan lebih menyukai beberapa kata dalam versi terjemahan, seperti \"tall tailles\" (panggilan Serigala untuk Torak) yang diterjemahkan menjadi tinggi takberekor atau \"Darkfur\" yang diterjemahkan menjadi Bulu Gelap.Mengenai covernya, uhm...masih bingung nih :D. Saya sih lebih suka cover warna ungu seperti aslinya, tapi saya gak suka dengan cave painting yang ada di cover ini.Sedangkan untuk cover versi Matahati, saya kurang suka warna hijaunya, tapi saya suka melihat lukisan burung hantu yang tercetak besar dan tampak mengintimidasi itu. Cocok dengan image Eostra yang memang mengintimidasi sebagai dukun klan burung hantu. Seandainya saja Matahati bisa memadukan kedua versi cover ini, pasti akan lebih bagus. (Yeah...you wish, Wi. Hehehe... ;p)Secara keseluruhan, saya memberi rating 5 bintang untuk serial Chronicles of Ancient Darkness. Kepiawaian Paver dalam merangkai plot yang rapi hingga akhir cerita jelas merupakan sebuah nilai plus. Lalu penggambaran setting yang detail serta pemahaman yang sangat baik tentang Serigala menunjukkan bahwa Paver melakukan riset dengan (sangat) serius untuk novelnya ini. Dan sebuah karya yang dikerjakan dengan serius, sangat layak dihargai nilai sempurna. :)Sudah banyak terbitan Matahati yang bagus sepanjang 2011 ini, sudah banyak pula yang saya baca. Tapi bagi saya, Ghost Hunter ini tetap yang terbaik karena telah menjawab rasa penasaran saya selama 5 tahun belakangan :D.also posted at : http://4urfun.blogspot.com/2011/12/ch..."}, {"userName": "Leona  Carstairs", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63240900-leona-carstairs", "userReview": "Woww, what an ending!

Saya bersyukur saya join Goodreads. Beberapa bulan lalu saya membaca di newsfeed seseorang bertanya ke A.S.Dewi nomor HP Pak Ahmad, lalu saya tanya siapa itu Pak Ahmad. Dari situ saya tahu Matahati sedang cuci gudang, sehingga saya memutuskan untuk borong. Bu dokter Dewi merekomendasikan beberapa judul serial, dan dia dengan keukeuh-nya mempromosikan COAD ini. Makasih utk kengototanmu, Wi! :-)Waktu mulai baca buku pertama, saya langsung berniat untuk membacakan kisah Torak ini untuk anak saya suatu saat nanti. Ini buku cerita anak-anak yang luar biasa. Saya berharap anak saya kelak bakal berfantasi, berlari bersama Torak, Renn, Serigala, Rip dan Rek, hutan, dangau, dll. Saya ingin anak saya belajar mencintai hutan dan alam bersama mereka. Saya ingin anak saya tumbuh dengan sifat pemberani, gigih, cerdik, setia kawan, dan penyayang, seperti karakter-karakter dalam serial ini.

It feels really bad that it ended. Everything was perfectly created, written, and described. You feel like you're in a different world when reading this series.In this book you even get more into Wolf's life full of emotional moments.

Unnatural winter and sickness, sent by Eostra, the scary Eagle Owl Mage, are killing the tribes, and Torak realizes he must venture out and fight Eostra, who seeks Torak, the last Soul Eater, to gain ultimate power.

I first read this book in (somewhat appropriately) the winter of 2010. It has not lost its genius since. Torak, Renn, Wolf and Fin-Kedinn have come a long way from who they once were. They are all much older, but where the younger members of the cast have matured, Fin-Kedinn is beginning to feel the bite of old age. Grey moths are pervading the pre-winter Forest, bringing foul dreams to the clans. Torak, though worried, can do little about this new menace. One night, as he sits alone, watching the Raven Clan as they sleep, Torak hears a voice coming from the trees, soft and pleading. He investigates, and sees the shade of his father, former Soul-Eater and the Wolf Mage; killed by a monstrous bear some months past.He strikes out into the wilderness, but his journey is far from uneventful. Tragedy strikes, and Wolf's family is shattered almost irreparably.Torak and Renn head north to the Mountain of Ghosts, where Eostra, Eagle Owl Mage and last of the Soul-Eaters sets in motion a plan that will bring the whole of the Forest and the North under her sway...Ghost Hunter is by turns, reserved, intense, funny, melancholic, joyous, eerie and heart-breaking. The characters (already well-rounded and interesting) grow even more, and we see a return of some old battlers I thought we'd never see again. The new character Dark is particularly of note, a sad, lost recluse who nonetheless finds a sense of kinship with Torak and Renn. We learn much more about the culture and life of the clans, and it is, as always, fascinating.Ghost Hunter is a triumphant return to form for Paver, and one of her best novels. You don't want the series to end, but the ending is more than satisfying. This is one of the best novels in the series, perhaps even better than the brilliant Soul Eater"}, {"userName": "Evan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4285429-evan", "userReview": "Six thousand years ago in the forests of Europe where people live in clans, evil threatens the lands. The last living soul eater, Eostra, the Eagle Owl Mage sends a shadow sickness to the clans. Orphaned teenage boy, Torak, is the one to stop the last and final Soul Eater from killing all life in the forest. Torak is not alone in his journey to the Mountain of Ghosts. His companions are Wolf, a wolf who Torak can speak to using wolf talk, and Renn, a mage in training for magic from the Raven Clan. Torak possesses an ability that is very rare--he is a spirit walker which means he can move into an animal\u2019s mind for a short period of time and control them. Torak\u2019s journey to the Mountain of Ghosts causes him to see his father as a ghost being summoned along with the dead Soul Eaters by Eostra. See what happens when Torak sees his father again. This will be Torak\u2019s final battle against evil and will he survive?This is the final book in the Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series. This book ties up the series with a \u201c5 star\u201d ending to Torak\u2019s journey.

A few years ago, I bought the entire series off of BookOutlet and man, I am finally done.Let's get this straight--I loved the first two books. I loved them as a kid, and I did really enjoy them as an adult. But man, as this series went on, it  dragged . Books four and five nearly killed me. It's not like, Lorien Legacies bad, but man, I was done with this series. And now I'm actually done with this series, so let's talk about some stuff I liked about it: Dark I'm a sucker for randomly inserted characters with zero social skills who end up fixing all the major problems. I know how he ended the book is a little bit of a cop-out, but do I care? No. Renn and Torak Seriously dude, been waiting since book one.  Being Done There's always some sort of awesome quality that the last book in a series has, whether it's good or not. And this wasn't bad. And it definitely had that quality of the Last Book, where everything is heightened and you know it has to be finished up now and that was cool.So that's that. I'm done. I'm done.

In hindsight, however, it's a good ending that encompasses all the possibilities, and sets all rumours to rest.Even the wolf pack got a happy ending- Shadow was the only cub-kit lost.

At the beginning, there are some of those things that do get repetitive - c'mom Torak, would you stop going off by yourself!! It is getting to be like a bad horror movie! Oddly, I felt like the horror element in this book wasn't as great as the others, but that could also be that we knew the evil so well at this point that it is not as much of a shock to encounter it.But Michelle Paver throws in some great twists with the plot that I really appreciated. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I will simply say that her choices allowed the last part of this journey to be as epic as it should be.

It doesn't often happen, but when I'd finished the book I really did not know what I would read next that would hold the same amount of sway over my attention and emotions!

It is a standard tale of good v evil but I loved her characters, I loved the mythology of the clans she has invented - the Raven clan, the Seal clan, the Wolf clan the Red Deer clan and others each with their own clan creature, herbology, traditions and spiritualism.

All of the books were amazing, and this one was no exception. It definitely held my attention the whole time and I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this series to boys OR girls who like action and adventure and a bit of fantasy. The story is set 6,000 years ago, so it's really unique and unlike anything I've ever read before. There are all kinds of unexpected twists and turns, and it kept me guessing to the end. There are also a lot of facts that teach us about how people lived a long time ago, but it doesn't at all feel like reading a history textbook. It is very exciting and scary and moving and so many other things which make this story absolutely amazing. Once again I love this series and would recommend it to anyone who likes action and fantasy. I hope you guys go check it out, because it's REALLY worth it, and maybe you'll enjoy it as much as I did."}, {"userName": "Bella", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14635492-bella", "userReview": "I am reviewing the experience of the series, Chronicles of Ancient Darkness. This series has thoroughly engaged me, and its burn was not fast and intense but slow and steady. The chapter illustrations were astoundingly simple yet beautiful. The pictorial representation has been a significant part of the delight I took from these six books. This series will be one of those books that I may purchase and keep for life.If I only look at this book, it wasn't one that I found most enjoyable and compelling out of all the six titles. I liked that the wolves' destiny was twisty and unpredictable. I didn't so much understand the descriptions of the scenery in part."}, {"userName": "Gillian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8860231-gillian", "userReview": "Had to wait ages this year for my local library to finally purchase the last book in the series - but it was worth it. A very satisfying conclusion to Torak and Renn's adventures and their physical, emotional and spiritual journey from childhood to young adulthood. These books really struck a chord, meticulously researched and detailed and so well written, they acted like a kind of time machine - whisking you away from modern life to a much more primitive time and place - that, surprisingly, seemed very familiar and appealing."}, {"userName": "Julie Anne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70482142-julie-anne", "userReview": "This is the last book of the series. I have to admit I did not like the ending but this book was very good. In this book Torak hunts the last soul eater. The Eagle owl mage. This book has a lot of twists in it and it is very emotional. This book has some words in it that we are not used to but it is nothing like the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit. This book is fantasy and I would recremend this book to someone who is not afriad of death and dark curses and spells."}, {"userName": "D\u0105br\u00f3wka Mocha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74876803-d-br-wka-mocha", "userReview": "Ostatnia cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 cyklu Kroniki Pradawnego Mroku.
