Bob, who likens his life to Clark W. Griswold's of National Lampoon's Vacation, likes to spend his time hanging out with his Horde, playing video games and hitting up the local bar scene. There are lots of fun moments in this book, and well worth the read. No blood, no gore, just light-hearted humor."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Bob The Zombie is a short story that reads more like the first chapter of a much larger tale, and given the fact that the author has already produced a sequel, it is clear that this is destined to become something of a serialized saga of this Griswoldian zombie. Bob is a hapless zombie who was killed in a tragically comedic way and was brought back to life at the request of his mother, who didn\u2019t realize he would come back as a rotting version of himself that needs to staple various body parts back on when they fall off, which they do with great frequency. Bob has made new friends-others like himself who lives on the edges of society. Zombies aren\u2019t like the slobbering Romero monsters here. They do need meat to continue their undead existence, but they tend to refrain from chowing down on humans. There is a flavor of urban fantasy to this tale. Zombies aren\u2019t the only supernatural characters. Though mostly just hinted at, there are plenty of other beasties out there, including vamps, mermaids, and ghouls. What is the difference between ghouls and zombies you ask? Well, zombies have free will, whereas ghouls are controlled by the witch who brought them back to life. And if they don\u2019t rein them in every now and then, they tend to go all Night of the Living Dead on humans. That particular nugget plays a part in this brief tale, but again, this short reads more like the introduction to a longer story, including hints of what is to come. So the main thing to keep in mind if you choose to take the plunge and give Bob The Zombie a try is that there is much more to the story, and unless I missed my guess, we will be getting it in single short story installments for some time to come. Bob is a likable character and it\u2019s clear there is more to learn about him as well as the rest of his not-so-menacing horde of buddies."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Besser", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4717868-rebecca-besser", "userReview": "Technically, 3.5 stars.Jaime Johnesee brings readers into close proximity of a friendly zombie who is just trying to deal with his existence and the world around him.Bob is now a zombie, and it\u2019s all because his mother missed him too much to let him rest in peace. Now he has to deal with the new \u201clife\u201d he\u2019s been dealt \u2013 there\u2019s no way out.He shares his struggles with his new friends and horde as he tries to help others out in his own kind way.This book is a fun, playful, entertaining read that I can see teens loving, especially if they have short attention spans; it\u2019s short. But, for me, it missed the mark on a couple points.The plot in Bob the Zombie was almost nonexistent, as if it were an afterthought, thrown in half-heartedly. There was little conflict that would push the character/story forward. Also, I have to wonder if Bob was one of those people (before he became a zombie) that everyone avoided because he over shared. Like that person that if you sat by them on the bus would tell you the intimate details of his life whether you wanted to know them or not. Why do I say this? Because he shares everything about himself in what seems like a nonstop info dump. There is no mystery involved in his existence. The read tells everything in big clumps. This leads to it being great for younger readers who are eager for everything to make complete sense with no effort or tension involved. The book is more of a \u201cmemoir\u201d of Bob\u2019s life than an actual story, especially with the weaknesses in conflict and plot."}, {"userName": "David Church", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4657159-david-church", "userReview": "Bob the Zombie a wonderful story that takes place in a world where Zombies, werewolves, necromancers, ghouls, witches, etc (I could go on & on) are part of the everyday norm. Bob is a zombie brought back after a \"Griswaldian\" accident by a distraught mother through a necromancer, who then no longer wants her son around once he starts rotting. I feel brainless writing the word \"heartwarming\" in a book titled Bob the Zombie. But that is what you get, a wonderfully funny yet heartwarming tale that will have you laughing out loud one minute and then feeling heart break for our fun loving protagonist in this well crafted story.Jaime Johnesee is one of those rare authors who can actually inject humor & cynicism into her story without it feeling forced. A fun read that I recommend and that I plan on reading multiple times. Just like Donkey Kong, this book has great replay value.

The cover is a great portrayal of the book, and you can see what you can expect: A fun loving pop culture zombie. There is a good sense of humour in this book, though I wouldn't call it a comedy, but it made me smile a lot. Bob is an interesting character and I like the approach the writer took to him. If you are looking for brains and gore, this isn't the book for you. But if you are looking for a nice story that can put a smile on your face, read about Bob.

There could have been a bit more depth to the other characters and plot. I got the feeling there is a bigger story to be told.

A fun quirky almost whisical account of Bob trying to make his afterlife the best he can. He was in a horrable accident and his mother wanted to do something for him. Then his son dies and he wants to do what he can for him. He has some of the same issues that a very unlucky person may have, dealing with an arch enamey but he has even more than the run of the mill issues of everyday life. You see he also has to deal with some issues only the rotting and decaying would have if they were up and about.In life Bob was a funny and nice guy.He is going to do the best he can to see the humor of the unlife he now lives.The one moral that jumps out is never ever consult a necromancer! Nothing good will ever come of it.This is not your heart pounding run for your life zombie book. This book will help you to get your funny bone in good working order.

I've had Bob the Zombie in my TBR list for quite a few months, and with the recent release of a couple of new stories, I thought it was time for me to give this one a try.And it was good fun. Bob is different. Bob is special. I'd love it for him to turn into the MacGyver of Zombies, but not with a Swiss knife, just through the use of his trusty stapler. He made me giggle a few times, and other times, he got me a little down. His goofiness contrasts with his sadness, and really created a connection with me, as a reader. And this usually makes me enjoy a story even more.I loved the humanity touch in him, and the lovely message that is passed on at the end. I'm looking forward to his Valentine experience, see how he deals with that situation."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "From his unfortunate demise to his eternal rising, issues with rejection, bits dropping off, some exceptional dance moves and an ongoing need for staples we are introduced to Bob!The humour ranges from smirking to a few Pepsi nose snorts, yes parts of it are pretty gruesome too!

The story is very entertaining and moves at a pace. Its short enough to be read in a single session and guaranteed to send you to bed with a smile.
