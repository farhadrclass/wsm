This book was absolutely infuriating. As I was reading it, I kept telling myself that I hated it. And so, I burned through it in a a little more than 24 hours. It bears little resemblance to any other novel I've ever read. The characters seem vague and unformed, but they come through with periodic startling observations about life and human nature that hit me like a punch in the stomach. The \"star system\" here on Goodreads is totally useless for this book. (Yeah, it's probably completely useless for every book, in truth, but that's another discussion.) I gave it four stars. What does that mean? Nothing. I hated it and loved it. Full of wisdom and completely meaningless. Irritating and boring, but a page-turner. And just like the book, my review makes no sense."}, {"userName": "Violet wells", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells", "userReview": "Reading Outline is like spying on an author in the process of auditioning characters for a future novel. In other words it is indeed an outline, an outline for a work that it still shadowy in the writer\u2019s mind. Cusk interviews her potential characters and lets them tell her emotionally pivotal stories about themselves. She makes no other dramatic demands of them. They become like a Greek chorus of voices without a play. A writer, unnamed until the penultimate chapter, travels to Athens to host a writing workshop. Each chapter either recounts a conversation with someone she meets or a group discussion with her writing class. If Cusk has an agenda, a unifying theme to these conversations it is the shredding of romantic illusion. Its principal agents, sexual attraction and parenthood, are both mercilessly called to account. Cusk, it becomes clear, had had enough of illusion. The narrator, bitter herself, extols the virtues of passivity as a philosophy of life. And by extension it\u2019s as if Cusk is bored with creating the illusions necessary to write novels. She\u2019s like the magician who can no longer be bothered to go through the charade of masking the tricks. She\u2019s a writer letting us know how bored she is with the theatre of constructing novels. However boredom is never going to be the best mainspring inspiration for the creation of a novel. There wasn\u2019t enough contrast in the tone or thrust of the voices for me. There was a sense everyone was hired to conform to a preconceived and adamant argument. And as such there was no sense of discovery in the novel. Beneath the surface of this novel is a current of unresolved bitterness, belonging, you sense, to the author herself. One of the novel\u2019s central premises is that every relationship is doomed to fail, to become little more than a distorting outline, or as one character puts it there\u2019s \u201ca disgust that exists indelibly between men and women and that you are always trying to purge with what you call frankness\" . Frankly, that\u2019s a melodramatic statement to me, a distortion of perspective caused by unresolved bitterness. And this bitterness, left in its pure state, prevents any possibility of evolution. Thus the novel ends as it begins, with little sense of a meaningful journey, with little resolution. In short, it\u2019s a novel that\u2019s much easier to admire than to love. It\u2019s very well written with some truly brilliant observations, it\u2019s intelligent, it holds its focus. It\u2019s also a novel that arouses the suspicion now and again that there might be a conceit involved, the presence of the emperor\u2019s new clothes factor. I enjoyed reading it; at the same time I have a feeling I\u2019ll remember nothing about it six months from now."}, {"userName": "Julie Ehlers", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2120450-julie-ehlers", "userReview": "In Outline, a writer named Faye (perhaps not unlike Rachel Cusk herself) travels to Athens for a few days to lead a writing workshop. Along the way, she engages in conversations with several people--her seatmate on the plane, other teachers and students in the workshop, friends she meets up with, friends those friends have brought along, et cetera. Sometimes Faye listens to these people without comment, sometimes she challenges them, sometimes she reveals something about herself. That's all. The novel is a collection of conversations.In the wrong hands, this could be a disastrous idea for a book, but in the hands of a good writer, what could be more interesting? (In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing other good writers tackle this same idea using their own experiences and travels. This book would be very different if written by, say, Nick Hornby, or Margaret Atwood.) In this particular case, I felt like I became the narrator. It was me on the plane, on the boat, having conversations with these people, and walking the streets of Athens. The oppressive heat of the summer gave the book a languorous feel. I was very happy to get lost in it, and while I related to some characters more than others, I suspect this is the kind of book that will reveal more of itself (and more of you to yourself) if you go back to it after a number of years have gone by.I can already hear the criticisms of this book: \"It's boring.\" (It isn't.) \"It's pretentious.\" (It's actually the furthest thing from pretentious--it's not trying to be anything other than what it is.) Or my favorite-least-favorite criticism of any book: \"No one actually talks like this.\" I don't know if it's true that no one actually talks like this--I haven't met everyone in the world. But frankly, if I wanted to hear how people actually talk, I'd go hang out at the bus station. Most of the time, I'd rather be reading novels like this one."}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "To call this a novel would seem to restrict it to a convention of style, to set up expectations of narrative rhythm and form. Outline, so aptly named, is a sketchbook of lives, charcoal drawings of souls captured in profile.The book is series of conversations delivered with a twanging chord of tension and self-interest. Or really, it's a collection of confessions delivered to a listener who reciprocates only rarely; she is an ear, an eye, a filter; less participant than sponge.The subject of the conversations is the failure of the domestic relationship, mostly marital, occasionally filial. It is a brittle and lonely satire on self-scrutiny. The narrator, a writer spending several days in Greece leading a writing workshop, moves about her emotional space like a somnambulist: present, but largely unaccounted for. Through encounters both small and profound, her streaming regrets and grief and guilt are subsumed by the people she meets\u2014some strangers, some familiar\u2014and she allows their troubles and complaints to drown out her own. Outline is an unsettling read, for there is a sense of a narrator disembodied from the story, coming to life only when she is directly addressed. We don't even learn her name until near the end (Faye, for what it's worth), as if her identity simply isn't the point. It's her silence that matters, the way others open up to her, the way strangers attach themselves to her malleability. The queasy strangeness is brilliantly etched; this is a work meant to be admired, not liked. I never really warmed up to the style or Faye, and I breathed a sigh of relief when this brief experiment came to an end, but I know I've read something entirely new (to me), a way to move the narrator from the frame and plant her behind the camera."}, {"userName": "Jaidee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17295672-jaidee", "userReview": "5 \u201cpristine, refreshing, clear\u201d stars. 2016 Bronze Award - Third Favorite Read (Tie) I am a man that resides in the world of emotion. They are here with me always and are always acute, not in the background. Emotions often make me soar to the heavens or shiver in delight, but other times they make me flounder, weigh me down like the experience of walking in the cold snow with a hole in my boot that leaves my precious foot frigid and lonely.I am unsure why the last paragraph came to my consciousness as I write a review of this sparkling , intelligent and mesmerizing book. This is an unusual novel that very successfully describes the process of thinking that in many ways is antithetical to my own psychological processes.This is a book about thought in its clearest and purest form. Emotion is not experienced, really, but rather described in a way that quenched my thirst and helped me navigate my inner wilderness.I had to read this book in such small sections as I wanted to savor each and every sentence that was so carefully crafted and became a miniature portrait of beauty in its simplest forms. Ms. Cusk is a photographer of thought and insight and she captures stills that really are too quick for the human eye or the rather the mind\u2019s eye to see. For the person that is thought based this would lead to interest and enlightenment but for somebody that is emotion based it leads (for me) to the heights of passion, a sense of wonder and at other times brief despair. Ms. Cusk\u2019s prose, however, rescues me and makes me shake in wonder with respect that her creative mind can distill with such clarity and wisdom many truths about relationships, personal histories and the everyday minutiae of life. Minutiae and details that really should not be overlooked but relished, for there are so many , and in each one there is a profoundness that can lead a thoughtful person to create a work of philosophy and an emotional one to either spiritual fervor or the elicitation of rarer emotions such as ecstasy and wonder.As I write this, I almost feel that I am channeling part of Ms. Cusk in an alternate form as the words are whirring out faster and faster onto this page. Her work makes me feel lighter, more beautiful and that my own personal story is important not just to myself but also perhaps to you, the reader. I cannot expect to be understood but through small conversations I can connect to you and clarify and see the world in its lightness, its darkness and its momentary illusions.I know by reading this review that you do not know what this book is about but I hope that these sentences convey my immense respect, my desire for more insights and my thankfulness that this novel has been created. This is not only on my more familiar emotional level but also through my written thoughts and reflections.This book is not about conversations as many reviewers have stated but a series of soliloquies that interact, merge, expand and sometimes die.Thank you Ms. Cusk. I want so much more of your prose that I am aching with longing. I am thirsty for thought already and again."}, {"userName": "Joseph Burgess", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4512778-joseph-burgess", "userReview": "Rachel Cusk is obviously a writer of tremendous talent, and \"Outline\" doesn't hide her skills.But I found this book to be lacking. The premise, on its face, is interesting: a series of conversations the narrator has with people she meets on her week in Athens that helps show the wide disparity of \"outlines\" and shapes of people's lives. It sounds existential and philosophical and hip and like half of all of the other novels that are coming out right now. For the most part, the book executes its intended premise well. We meet all sorts of characters \u2014 including her \"neighbor\" from an airplane ride who occupies multiple chapters in the book \u2014 to see how their past life experiences provide shape and form to who they are today.But after a while, how much can the reader take of just hearing about different sorts of people with no action actually happening? I mean I guess yes, the narrator is going through a week of Athens, and the narrator is doing things: she is on a boat with a man she barely knows, she's teaching a writing class, she's hanging out with writers. But is that it? I'm not saying the narrator had to be jumping out of moving cars and scaling tall buildings, but at the same time, I need something to happen. After a while, I was tired hearing another character psychoanalyze himself or herself. It just became too much. And what about the narrator? I left feeling like I knew something about 25 or 30 strangers, but I knew nothing about the narrator herself, or how these interactions with other people affected her. Maybe that was the intended point: that for us, the readers, we were left with only an outline of the narrator. But that didn't do it for me. I expected more in the way of plot development by a writer who has an abundance of talent.For the first 60 pages, this book was really fantastic. But by the end, I was happy it was over. I can't say I was disappointed with the ending, because I didn't know what the ending should be. There was no action that would lead one to have an expectation for what the ending should be.So I don't know. My opinion is just one of what I'm sure are many out there on this book.

The stories Faye hears - from this man, from her co-teacher, from her students and friends - make up the narrative, and in between we learn a little of her own life. So it's not terribly eventful, and there certainly isn't a plot, but the characters' conversations are fascinating, having that pleasant quality of feeling real in the way they jump from subject to subject and head off in irrational directions, yet being better than reality - more articulate, with fewer interruptions, more coherent and measured and simply more interesting.

There is some of the best writing in it, but because of the lack of story AND abundancy of stories it was a tough read. There is at the same time nothing and too much going on. It is a rather new and fresh take on storytelling (altough it reminded me of Jenny Offill, Valeria Luiselli, Miranda July and especially Ben Lerner). It is so dense and deep that you really have to stay 100% concentrated all the time. Often, I was enjoying a certain episode, anecdote or passage (one of hundreds) when I got distracted by a phone, mail, daydream, and it was so hard to get into it again. It felt like listening and being sucked in to a moody yet difficult Coltrane solo, pushing the pause-button and then continuing - of course with huge difficulty. I marked lots of beautiful thoughts, phrases, psychological insights. I can imagine that rereading would imply discovering and marking other passages...So I would advice everybody to read the 10 chapters as slow as possible: read them as seperate short stories, that's perfectly possible.Then you will fully enjoy her incredible writing!\"I had this feeling,\u2019 she continued, \u2018which I have had since and which gets worse each time we argue, that we were caught in a net of words, tangled up in all these strings and knots, and that each of us thought there was something we could say that would set us free, but the more words we spoke the more tangles and knots there were.

Then, one fateful year, everyone recommended a certain book; she purchased it in expensive hardcover, read it in a day, and was completely flummoxed. The book was garbage. What to make of this? She decided that the U.K. publishing scene is so small and (her word) incestuous that they just read the same five books and then talked about them for a week before moving on. She no longer looks to the TLS end of the year special for any tips.* And Rachel Cusk's abysmal 'Outline' seems to be another case of British froth that has now migrated across the pond for no obvious reason. You might really like to read 'Outline' if, for instance, you really want to read a version of Jacob's Room without all that excessively beautiful prose, and you just can't get enough of the post-Sebaldian \"I did this, then I did that, I thought about a kiss, then I sat on a cat\" contemporary novel. Yes, this is a book in which a woman goes to Greece and talks about stuff with people. You may be shocked to learn that a) people get divorced andb) people tell stories about themselves. But I suggest you should be more shocked that a book set in contemporary Greece, of all places, is so hermetically sealed in the world of upper-middle class creative/business types. You should be shocked that the dreary prose of Literary Fiction can receive such rapturous reviews. You should be shocked that deep wisdom about being \"caught in a net of words\" and \"trying to find a different way of living in the world\" and the odd spot of anti-literary meta-narrative (\"a story might merely be a series of events we believe ourselves to be involved in, but on which we have absolutely no influence at all\"; \"the story of improvement... has even infected the novel, though perhaps now the novel is infecting us back again, so that we expect of our lives what we've come to expect of our books\") can be thrown between two covers and sold to the general public.

The books are narrated by a writer and now creative writing teacher, a recently divorced mother of two boys \u2013 this together with her name (Faye) mentioned only once in each book is almost all we know about her. Instead the book, narrated in the first person, is the record of various conversations with she has in which she plays a typically passive role listening to the other person\u2019s life story and perhaps making a few comments and questions.In the first book she visits Athens to teach a creative writing course, those she talks to include her neighbour on the plane (ex a successful shipping owner), the attendees at her creative writing course, friends, fellow teachers. The themes explored in the stories include the unreliability of other\u2019s stories, storytelling itself, female identity, progression and improvement (and its inadequacy) but often basically people\u2019s relationships with family.All of the stories feature protagonists in not dissimilar positions to Faye and we realise that in some ways the stories and her reaction to them tell us about Faye by a process (one that Cusk in interviews refers to as \u201cannihilated perspective\u201d which is made explicit at the end of the book, when another teacher tells Faye about a conversation she had with her neighbour on the plane \u201cthe longer she listened to his answers, the more she felt that something fundamental was being delineated, something not about him but about her. He was describing \u2026 what she was not \u2026. This ant-description \u2026 had made something clear to her by a reverse kind of exposition; while he talked she began to see herself as a shape, an outline, with all the detail filled in around it while the shape itself remained blank \u2026.(which) gave her \u2026 a sense of who she now was\u201d. In the book\u2019s last paragraph, the Greek seat-neighbour contacts her and says (as she does not want to meet\u201d that he will spend the day in \u201csolicitude\u201d, which she corrects to mean \u201csolitude\u201d \u2013 again a key part of the book\u2019s theme.The second book contains some slightly weaker elements \u2013 a key part of the book is Faye\u2019s decision to buy a very run down flat and to bring it builders to renovate and soundproof it \u2013 her elderly and hostile neighbours downstairs are unconvincing and one dimensional (and oddly do not have any story of their own \u2013 almost uniquely across the two novels), however the overall effect is still compelling. Faye\u2019s intervention in people\u2019s accounts of their lives (her hairdresser, her builders, one of her students, some recently divorced and remarried friends), deliberately adding her own views and seeking their perspective on it, is much greater in this book \u2013 and as a result the accounts have more of a common theme looking at change and reinvention and its interaction with freedom. She also meets a man with whom she starts a tentative relationship \u2013 and has a feeling of pulling away from a precipice."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa", "userReview": "3.5I\u2019ve been reading a lot of late-19th-century writing and something told me to take at least a short break, so I requested this from the library. While its prose is intelligent and impressive, I thought of abandoning the book early on. Eventually the structure, which is its main element, grew on me. To fully understand the meaning behind the structure (and the title), you need to read to the end. The narrator\u2014referenced by name once only\u2014 is a great listener, as well as a passive one. The mostly-monologues of acquaintances and friends are recorded as if verbatim but certainly aren\u2019t, as all are told in the same style, supposedly that of the writer-narrator. The bits we glean of the narrator herself are tucked into these almost-soliloquies. Comparisons and contrasts within their tales of loss, bewilderment, disgust and invisibility reflect upon the little we know of her. Amid her silence are layers of unreliable narrators. The most affecting detail for me came not from any of these people talking at the almost-nameless narrator but from a phone call she receives from her young son, a call she must negotiate while at work in another country.

Another 19th-century novel, of course, and I\u2019m much more engrossed in it than I ever was in this.

The book consists entirely of the different monologues of the people. The man on the plane, referred to only as \"the neighbor,\" details the dramas of his multiple marriages, giving an unsurprisingly biased account of his three wives and their flaws. The narrator is separated from her husband, her life seems to be in turmoil, but the book buries her story underneath those of the people she encounters, sometimes allowing details to surface. Overall, the narrator remains a mystery throughout the text.During the writing class in Greece, the narrator asks her students to tell stories about what they noticed on the way to the class. The exercise is viewed as so pointless by one student that she storms out, demanding a refund. What I got from the writing class scenes was the idea that being a writer is about more than putting words to paper. It's about more than grammar and syntax. To be a writer is to see the world in a unique way, it means having open eyes to the world around you and registering the nuances of consciousness, it means discovering the extraordinary in the mundane. The disgruntled student doesn't understand how sitting in a room telling stories could make her a better writer. but it's precisely the act of telling a story, of shaping our chaotic everyday life into a concise narrative, that is the foundation of writing.As I read \"Outline,\" I found myself paying more attention to things--to how my cat purrs when I rub her chin and the sound of the frog croaking outside my bedroom window and the conversations I have with others. All these ordinary occurrences acquired greater meaning because I noticed them more and studied them and felt them and gave them my full attention instead of dismissing them as unimportant or banal. We all have stories to tell and most of us feel the urge to share those stories with other people, whether it's a stranger on an airplane, a teacher in a classroom, or a close friend in a cafe. Cusk's book affirms this desire, this need, for storytelling and how it bonds us together and enriches our lives."}, {"userName": "Conor", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor", "userReview": "A tactic familiar with professions as diverse as interrogators, lawyers, and psychologists is to resist the polite urge to fill silences with small talk, to refrain from being your conversation partner's crutch, in the hope that the other guy will be sufficiently destabilized by the solecism to overcompensate with his own palaver. Interrogators hope to get access to secret, front-of-mind information; attorneys seek an uncharacterized narrative; psychologists aim to obtain insight into thought processes free from outside coaxing. Regardless of the outcome sought, the outpouring is meant to be purer and more precious than that which can be elicited through the normal foxtrot of conversation, where the give-and-take permits more time to regain one's footing, and to predict through experience where the conversation will go. For this reason, and perhaps for a sense of verisimilitude, this type of soliloquy is rare in novels. And while I\u2019m not sure I would call \u201cOutline\u201d a novel, I\u2019m not sure the distinction much matters. I see this book as an additional entry in a list of recent books that blur the boundaries between the short story collection and the novel, and do so with stunning prose, a masterful grasp of tone, and the impressive inventiveness required to gin up the cast of disparate, quirky, and realistic characters. A very interesting short read!"}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11576881-brian", "userReview": "Like watching paint dry without the action of having paint run down the wall.

Oddly enough, this time I had no such problem (as with the initial time) getting into the book - in fact I read the first 100 pages in a single sitting, and finished the entire book within a 24 hour period. I still found myself re-reading passages, but rather than seeing this as a deficiency, realized that what I was reading was so dense, it screamed out for careful investigation. Am starting Transit this morning, with the hopes it too speeds along, so I can begin Kudos tomorrow. Original review, 11/3/2016: More like a 3.5, mainly due to the fact it took me an inordinately long time getting into this odd book. I spent 3 days on the first 50 pages, then read the following 200 in a day and a half. Ultimately, I more or less 'got' what Cusk was after, and admired her prose and her ability to keep one's attention when virtually nothing happens plot-wise. I found myself reading and re-reading and re-reading yet again to make sure I was getting all the philosophical subtleties, which sometimes made my little brain hurt. But Cusk ultimately won me over and I am looking forward to reading Transit and her third volume in this trilogy."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly", "userReview": "It's meandering, and subtle, and subtextual. I liked Outline so much more once I'd jettisoned the audiobook and settled down with the printed words so that I could read slowly, re-read, circle back. I haven't read Cusk's Aftermath, her memoir about her divorce, but apparently she kicked up a real shitstorm with it, and this oblique fictional experiment is a result of that. It's a sequence of linked conversations with a female character - who is not Cusk but also not unlike Cusk - who listens to several people tell her their own stories, their own impressions of their experiences. It's a pretty brilliant approach because this time Cusk isn't going to tell a reader what to think, and she's not going to be accused of being unreliable, or opinionated or judgmental, and she's not going to raise anyone's hackles. She's a sounding board to these near-soliloquies, and the speakers are the ones who end up looking foolish, self-aggrandizing, or sad. It sounds a little artificial and coy to describe it this way, as if Cusk is playing tricks, but it didn't read that way to me. It also says something about gender: I began to realize how very few speakers ask the character any questions about herself even as she listens and listens to them talk. One reviewer thinks this cipher-ness causes gender stereotypes to fall away, but I thought it highlighted them - I couldn't imagine a modern male character being this self-effacing AND present simultaneously. (I'm not suggesting men cannot be both, just that she brings stereotypes to the surface.) I grew to know this character - the term protagonist hardly fits for there is little agon - by the subtlety of her responses/non-responses to what's she heard - she and I together were listening.

It's probably a 165-page double-spaced manuscript at most, formatted to 249 easily turned pages, a good idea on the part of the publisher to accelerate a reader's progress since it's not plot-driven at all and only over time does the outline of the narrator, her history and pain, become more and more apparent. At best, this one's sentences lengthen as insights are laid out naturally, gracefully, like they're propelled by someone quite capable of holding her breath for as long as it takes. At worst, it's perfectly fine but feels a bit like a stiff second draft, or like it was translated into literary English from the original posh British. There's middle-ground, too, but more so it moved along with always unpredictable yet steady movement and stretches of summarized and/or idealized dialogue I admired (few people speak the way these people speak). The chapters seemed more like separate stories until they cohered but even then it's one of those novels that suggest an otherwise undescribed core. Loved the story about the dog. Felt absolutely non-fictionally real throughout. Read it to prepare for the second volume in this series, which came with an extraordinarily strong recommendation from my mother (she gave me her copy and forced it into my reading queue) and which I'll read next."}, {"userName": "jo", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/210397-jo", "userReview": "this is a book that should be read at least twice. i mean this in all seriousness. but i'm not going to read it twice because i am pretty much unable to read books twice unless i have a gun to my head, so this review will be at best superficial, at worst worthless and misleading. please do believe me. in this highly original, genre-defying novel, an english writer who has traveled to athens, greece, to teach a class on writing (you see the layers already) has a number of encounters, and of these encounters she reports absolutely everything, including every single word said by the people present. these accounts, though, are not realistic. the way our narrator's interlocutors speak is unusually introspective and intimate, and deeply analytical. these people give our narrator an \"outline,\" so to speak, of their lives, while at the same time turning them around and around as if they were glass balls, and analyzing them in great detail. these accounts and analyses are wholly subjective, since neither the narrator nor we have any way to verify if what the people say is truthful. and this is key, because in literature, in fiction, you just assume, not having anything else to go on, that what the characters say is true, and when it is not, well, it is a very big deal. when the characters of a book say something that is untrue, it is invariably a crucial narrative point (when the narrator does we have the bewitching and overdiagnosed phenomenon of the unreliable narrator). so, the very fact that we feel that what the characters tell our narrator may or may not be true is a narrative feat, and all kudos go to cusk for planting the seed of doubt about these seemingly simple reports. as the above paragraph suggests, the characters who tell their own stories in the chapters of this book are not personally known by, or only superficially known to, the narrator. this constitutes a part of the whole credibility issue. it also highlights the narrator's aloneness and isolation. as others have noted, the narrator is a cypher who reflects the characters' own stories. her story is interwoven with her interlocutors' stories, not only or primarily because she is the listener, but because she chooses to recount the stories she patiently listened to. patiently is a key word. the interlocutors' narratives are nothing short of assaultive. these people go on and on without the least concern for their listener. the only time one of them shows any interest in the narrator's life is in the first chapter, and the narrator remarks on it, noticing that the man who is asking \"and what about you?\" questions must have learned this somewhere, and that is why he's doing it so clumsily and stiffly (it didn't read clumsy or stiff to this reader, but of course the narrator is, shall we say, there, and her account is the last word). most people, the narrator continues, never learn to reciprocate someone's listening to them with some listening of their own. the rest of the book bears this out completely. so, to summarize: a bunch of strangers or quasi-strangers hijack our narrator's attention to tell their life stories (mostly stories about broken domestic relationships), barely asking her anything about herself. these life stories are unrealistically personal, intimate, and self-exploratory. i imagine that this kind of introspection and self-disclosure would happen only in a very dense session with a deeply committed therapist. our narrator chooses to report these conversations, nay, monologues, it appears, verbatim, and, also, she spends quite some time describing her surroundings, the occasion of the meeting, the food that gets eaten, and anything else she happens to observe. some of these people are named, some are not. one can read meaning into it, or not. so, the first layer i'd like to focus on is that this book is about a writer who is in athens to teach writing while using other people's (most ofV them writers'!) stories to shape a novel. this makes the novel suspect. are these narratives reported accurately? why should they be? and if they are not, are they really about the interlocutors or are they about the narrator herself? what if she made them up? what if she decided to talk about herself through the literary device of having or pretending to have people talk about themselves? who is doing the talking?and why the assaultive nature of these conversations (and, on some occasions, also of some characters' behavior)? the fact that the female narrator gets steamrolled regularly by the stream of words her mostly male interlocutors vomit on her is hard to miss. as the reader, you end up hating these characters who talk incessantly about themselves, taking advantage of the narrator's silence, of her \"feminine\" meekness and receptivity. but of course some of the interlocutors are women, too. except: the men's and the women's verbal vomiting felt different to me. for one, the women seemed to talk less (i didn't reread the novel and i am not going to count, so this may be inaccurate, though it is certainly accurate that it is my impression). also, one male character returns repeatedly, and his endless talking, in spite of occasional \"how about you\"s, becomes by the end so brutal that even our patient or passive or exploitative narrator gets snippy. meaningfully, when she gets snippy she also gets, for the first time, scared of him. granting herself agency, and a mind of her own, seems to make her feel suddenly vulnerable, as if that were a line she was never meant to cross. all of the characters, including the narrator, talk about less than a handful of themes: marital relationships gone south, their rapport to their children, writing, and traveling to greece. since i read the novel only once i don't have a good grasp of the thrust of these accounts of (mostly failed, troubled, or disappointing) relationships, but it seems to me, mostly basing myself on the narrator's few interventions, that the book has a overall tone of nihilism and disillusionment. there is very little of value in romantic love, or in writing, or in being in a place as beautiful as greece (this last claim is contradicted by the detailed and sensual descriptions of parts of athens, which felt to me absolutely mouthwatering). it's hard to love one's own children, and life throws innumerable curve balls at us, most of which end up hitting us in the teeth, causing severe damage. at the same time, this novel celebrates, obliquely, the immense wealth that is to be mined in engaging with strangers. true, these people are annoying, even intolerable, but they gave our narrator a novel, didn't they?"}, {"userName": "Jennifer (aka EM)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1393336-jennifer-aka-em", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book a lot as I was reading it - but I honestly can't remember precisely what I liked or, really, much of what I read. I know I liked the writing; there's an elegance to it and to the slow, careful unlayering of the characters' thoughts and motivations as they tell the narrator the stories of their lives (or pieces of them). We never really get to know anyone - even tho' they are sharing masses of details, many many words, about some of the most personal aspects of their lives. Their relationships, the failing of these relationships; the cruelties they've experienced and, sometimes, doled out in these relationships.But we never get beyond these characters' subjective 'truths' - quotation marks because there is a good deal of questioning of whether or not they in fact are telling the truth. Whether, indeed, they even know the truth. This telling of personal stories takes place by writers, for the most part, to a narrator who is teaching a writing class, i.e., teaching people how to tell stories. There is something delightful in the dynamic tension created as people appear to be deeply self-reflective and self-revelatory, with words that seem thoughtful and laden with insight, but who give us just the briefest slices of their lives in story form (outlines, as it were) which may or may not be true; and that by necessity are disconnected from any verifiable reality beyond the narrator's own assessment of whether she believed them or not.The stories the narrator is told (making up the story we readers are told) are shown to be vapour-thin and ephemeral - maybe real, maybe not; maybe truth, maybe fiction.

I am unsure if the word \u2018novel\u2019 even applies in this instance. Anti-novel seems more like it; we only learn the name of the mysterious narrator at 84% of the ebook, who is solely defined by the conversations and interactions she has with those around her, from a man she sits next to on a plane to students in a writing class in Greece.In Chapter X, the writing teacher who supplants the narrator recounts her own conversation with a plane passenger: \u201cThe longer she listened to his answers, the more she felt that something fundamental was being delineated, something not about him but about her.\u201dThis \u2018anti-description\u2019 clarifies a fundamental truth for her: \u201cWhile he talked she began to see herself as a shape, an outline, with all the detail filled in around it while the shape itself remained blank.\u201dThis quivering blankness, shimmering in its lack of definition yet burgeoning with possibility, is at the heart of this novel, which is acutely observed.The contrivance of having students recount stories at a writing class is more than a showcase for Cusk\u2019s finely balanced sense of pathos and minutiae: it is a fundamental reflection of the concept of the \u2018outline\u2019, of the processes of definition and invisibility that shape the world around us, giving meaning to the stories of our lives on one level, and shaping the larger historical context on the other.The problem with this \u2018outline\u2019 though is that its absence necessarily distances the reader; we are creatures of emotions more than we are of signs and meanings, at the end of the day."}, {"userName": "Gill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18845147-gill", "userReview": "'Outline' by Rachel Cusk3 stars/ 6 out of 10Rachel Cusk is a name that I know; however I have not read anything by her previously.'Outline' is a short novel.

Its style is quite different from the majority of present-day novels.However, the many occasions on which I was reminded of W.G. Sebald's writing proved distracting for me. As the book progressed my main thoughts became less about this novel, and more about how much better I felt Sebald's work to be. I'm not clear whether or not Cusk intended her readers to make this connection; when it came to the point that the narrator talks about the feeling of Vertigo (this occurs more than once), the similarities became too strong for me.
