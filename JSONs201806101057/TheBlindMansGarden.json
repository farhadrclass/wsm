When narrating how he had to tape his eyes over for a few weeks to write about a character who was going blind, he said something along the lines of:But you understand why I had to do it? I had no choice. I couldn't ask all those intimate questions of a blind person. I had to live it.Very understandable but only a little way into the book, I could not shake off the feeling that something was amiss. Going over the volume another time I discovered it was the message inadvertently embedded in its textuality: the book is not written for me. It is written for a Western audience.Exhibit A: \"She looks out of the window, past the low rosewood bough from which a sheep is hung every year to be disembowelled and skinned just minutes from its last concious moments, to mark the Sacrifice of Abraham\". It's called Bakra Eid and there is no reason to be so apologetic and over explanatory for it especially since it has no bearing on the plot. Any appearance of vernacular language is meticulously translated and there aren't many to begin with. All characters speak with the same voice which has zero regional influence and some details are inaccurate (12 buttons in one rupee, seriously?). All of this would not have been a problem if the chief claim of the book wasn't that it helps in understanding this complicated country. 'I think first of the subject matter and then the characters and plot which would facilitate in addressing it', Nadeem Aslam claimed at the Lahore Literary Festival. And this is exactly where he faltered. Reading this book felt like I was eavesdropping on a conversation I wasn't a part of.Living in Pakistan during those times is perhaps as complicated as the loss of sight. Although there is no rule preventing a writer from addressing what is not directly experienced but literature, despite and because of being self validating carries the burden of proof. Aslam could not address Pakistan even armed with piles of research. Perhaps, he had to live it."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (aka EM)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1393336-jennifer-aka-em", "userReview": "This is a complex book, filled with complex emotions. \"Nuanced\" doesn't come close to describing its portrayal of fundamentalist Islamist fervour and the various forces and interpretations within Islam that in many ways define it, and also attempt to balance it [ultimately ineffectually? not sure], but in the end, must simply survive it.The same nuance and complexity emerge with respect to the use of torture, the oppression of women, or just about any other issue raised in this novel of post-9/11 Pakistan / Afghanistan, seen through the eyes of a constellation of characters who must navigate, often blindly, (and both literally and figuratively), through the inherent conflicts of their own beliefs, relationships, and realities in the world around them.A central conundrum - the prevailing dynamic - is the clash of religions and, more broadly, cultures which both cause the conflicts, and ultimately also provide the only tools to endure, if not resolve, them.This book forced me to confront a lot of my own assumptions, emotions and attitudes - and I'm left holding these thoughts in each of my hands and different parts of my brain, irreconcilable. At the same time, as jo points out in her exceptional review, although there is much that is disquieting and even rage-inducing, there is also the intense beauty of the writing and imagery, and especially, the Mikal character's unswerving goodness and sense of justice. This book is sometimes overwhelming, always challenging, and probably not for everyone. It is a test of tolerance and empathy, in many ways. The beauty of the writing, the power of the imagery, the essential force of goodness that drives (again, literally and figuratively) the action in the character of Mikal, is the reason I've given it five stars."}, {"userName": "jo", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/210397-jo", "userReview": "nadeem aslam is a treasure to the world and everyone should read him. his writing is simply fantastic -- i think i liked the writing in The Wasted Vigil better, but probably one would like best the one one reads first. the writing's fullness and ornatedness -- the riches of adjectives, similes, metaphors, imagery, and occasionally magic -- has reminded better readers than i of urdu and of the ancient poetic tradition of islam. here's an eloquent passage from manjul bajaj's lovely review in Outlook India (the review is excerpted on goodreads, where i found it):\nSeeping out from beneath the grammar and syntax of his perfectly polished adopted tongue is the melancholy and ache of Urdu\u2019s vivid images and startling metaphors... Moonlight, fireflies, flowering plants and trees, singing birds, the movement of the stars and the colour of the sky texture the narrative and act as subliminal triggers which create an emotional subtext connecting the reader to the beauty of Islam\u2019s poetic and artistic traditions.\nlight is a dominant theme. the light of stars, of kerosene lamps; the light of the dappled sun and of sun- and moonlight reflected in water; the light of fireflies; often the lack of light, like when power is cut and generators don't work, or when someone goes blind and the light his eyes can still see is more a tease that an aid. this is present in Wasted Vigil too. also: representation, especially the sly representation of pentimento painting, a tool of survival in a world where extremist islamism makes images forbidden.then books, books everywhere, and nature: flowers, plants, smells, tastes; animals. animals have a particular place in his extraordinary book, and here i'll say what makes it so extraordinary: as manjul bajaj so beautifully and accurately says, \"the book is Aslam\u2019s prayer for the whole world, his attempt to bathe it in light.\" but i think that aslam goes even farther than this. i think that in his book he makes peace. he creates it. he imagines it and makes it happen. all of his characters (in this book, unlike in Wasted Vigil they are muslim except for one, the priest of the school where two of our protagonists teach) are peace-loving people who put humanity, decency, and compassion way ahead of their own safety, comfort, and lives. the tremendous injury of the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks -- a whole country attacked for no reason at all, its people decimated, its cities and villages reduced to rubble, fundamentalism and rage stoked with the most powerful bellow of all -- is mourned deeply and shown clearly in the book, but there is no anger: only a huge sorrow. and the protagonists of the book, this motley host of sometimes weird and always beautiful characters put their bodies in the wound and heal it. it's aslam's novel and he can do what he wants with it. so he heals this unhealable wound. he does it mainly through the unbelievably lovely character of mikal, whose love for animals and for peace, whose utter inability to be angry, whose putting peace ahead of desire and self, are poetry unto themselves. to say more is to give away the book, but if you read this extraordinary work of art, pay attention to mikal all through the book and in particular in the second half. pay attention to his carefulness with life -- all life. to his tenderness. to his earnestness. to his incredible love.aslam uses a quote from simone weil at a crucial point in the book: \"Love is not consolation, it is light.\" i am not sure what weil meant when she wrote it; i'm not even sure what it means, in general. but in this book this quote could not be more appropriately placed. and let me say, it is difficult to set a book in immediately-post-9/11 afghanistan and not make it drip with rage. i did occasionally feel rage. you will too. but aslam is SO NOT AFTER rage. he bathes the world with light."}, {"userName": "Ali", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/804942-ali", "userReview": "Having read each of Nadeem Aslam\u2019s previous novels with great enjoyment, I bought this one in hardback almost as soon as it was released. His novel Maps for Lost Lovers \u2013 which took Aslam ten years to write \u2013 I\u2019ve read twice and it remains one of my favourite modern novels. Aslam\u2019s last novel The Wasted Vigil which is also set in Afghanistan \u2013 I enjoyed \u2013 but found the message ultimately hopeless, I wondered therefore what this one would be like. Having read Aslam before I knew I wasn\u2019t in for a comfortable ride \u2013 it wasn\u2019t, but it is definitely worth it.Nadeem Aslam\u2019s fourth novel is often brutal and sometimes angry, but totally unforgettable. Aslam\u2019s often poetic writing is rich in imagery and deeply poignant. Weaving together the political and social realities of Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the tragic story of a family deeply and irrevocably affected by the war which comes in the wake of 9/11, The Blind Man\u2019s Garden is ultimately, a story of hope and resilience.\u201cIf love was the result of having caught a glimpse of another's loneliness, then he had loved Mikal since they were ten years old.... This almost-brother. This blood-love in everything but name.\u201d Jeo and Mikal are foster brothers from a small Pakistani town; together they decide to go to Afghanistan, following the terrorist attacks in the USA, to care for wounded civilians. However there are malign forces at work against the pair, and their good intentions soon put them both into harm\u2019s way. Left behind are Jeo\u2019s wife Nadeem, secretly in love with Mikal, and Rohan, the father who brought them up, slowly going blind, and haunted by the memory of his dead wife. \u201cHe walks out into the garden where the first few lines of moonlight are picking out leaves and bowers. He takes a lantern from an alcove. Standing under the silk-cotton tree he raises the lantern into the air, looking up into the great crown. The tallest trees in the garden are ten times the height of a man and even with his arm at full stretch Rohan cannot extend the light beyond the nearest layer of foliage. He is unable to see any of the bird snares \u2013 the network of thin steel wires hidden deep inside the canopies, knots that will come alive and tighten just enough to hold a wing or neck in delicate, harmless captivity.Or so the stranger had claimed. The man had appeared at the house late in the morning today and asked to put up the snares. A large rectangular cage was attached to the back of his rusting bicycle. He explained that he rode through town with the cage full of birds and people paid him to release one or more of them, the act of compassion gaining the customer forgiveness for some of his sins.\u201dAlso left behind are Basie, Mikal\u2019s elder brother and Yasmin his wife, Rohan\u2019s daughter. They teach at a local Christian school run by Father Mede \u2013 which some Islamic zealots wanting to make a name for themselves, have their eye on. At another local school \u2013 Ardent Spirit \u2013 the sinister Major Kyra and his saluki hound stalk the rooftop watching the town and mourning the loss of his own brother in Afghanistan.Set against the backdrop of the superstitions and strictures of a small town in Pakistan, and among the wilds of Afghanistan, The Blind Man\u2019s Garden takes the reader on a terrible journey. The war is seen from many perspectives, those left behind, those caught up in a war they don\u2019t believe in, the war lords and the American soldiers, and the women for whom the world is uneven and narrow. Nadeem Aslam tells a story that sometimes makes the reader want to look away; it is a story of terrible events coming out of misunderstanding and suspicion. There are faults on each side, Aslam unflinchingly portrays the Islamic zealot, the war lord, the American soldier and the misguided follower realistically \u2013 beliefs fuelled by hysteria and propaganda leading to savage acts of war."}, {"userName": "Marla", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2420967-marla", "userReview": "There are books that I can breeze through, not thinking much, just allowing myself to be entertained. This is probably the majority of books for me. Within 20 pages, I felt off-kilter. I soon realized The Blind Man's Garden was the OTHER kind of book, the book that demands your full attention and engages you fully. Read.every.word.no.skimming. The kind of book where you don't stop to feed yourself or answer the phone, where you just wander from bed, to couch, to chair...occasionally changing the locale of your reading. If I read a book like this every couple of years, I consider myself really lucky.Blind Man's Garden is set in post 9/11 Pakistan and Afghanistan. It's the story of one family and their struggle to survive hardship and loss while maintaining their humanness. If you're a Muslim-hater, this book isn't for you, (unless you're willing to take a look through the eyes of a different culture, someone not like you). That being said, Blind Man's Garden isn't anti-American (or pro-Muslim). It portrays reality. It shows atrocities committed by both sides rooted in fear of the enemy, the challenges of women once used to relative freedom now trying to contend with wearing their jewelry hidden under black robes, husbands afraid for their wives to leave the home, lest they be stopped by the religious police, the fear of angering a neighbor who might tell lies about you to the authorities. I likened it to Nazi Germany with different trappings. It shows that caught up in all the politics, there are everyday people, laughing with their husbands, hugging their children, eating meals together...just people. It's not a political book, but a book about PEOPLE.If you read Khaled Hosseini's \"And the Mountains Echoed\", and are feeling sad at the prospect of waiting 5 years for his next book, your wait is over. This book is AT LEAST as well written, the story more smooth in my opinion. It's beautifully written. If you don't like descriptive writing, steer clear. The author must be a gardener, because I smelled the orange blossoms, felt the bark of the henna trees, and saw the hedges of jasmine vine. The bad thing is it's a library book and I have to return it. The good thing is Nadeem Aslam has three other books for me to read. Blind Man's Garden is just superb. Really amazing. I can't recommend it enough. 10 stars."}, {"userName": "Audrey Chin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10419345-audrey-chin", "userReview": "I read this book because I'll be on a panel at Singapore Writer's Festival with this prize-winning author.It's another of those fraught narratives about Afghanistan. I don't think I would have finished the book if not for feeling duty bound to do so because of the panel.Like Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns, Aslam offers us a very well-drawn view of a society and mind-set that many of us wouldn't otherwise get to experience. My problem was that the writing was too good and made me feel too intensely the constraints of those living in that society. My head literally felt blinkered by the Blind Man's religious philosophy. As for the constraints the women had to live with, well... No more said.This book highlights what a gulf there is between those of us accustomed to having a liberal Western mindset and those of other persuasions. A particularly telling vignette is the shock and horror experienced by Afghan villagers confronted with a stray American soldier who has the words \"Infidel\" defiantly tattoed on himself. For me, this was the tiny piece of glass that magnified the reality of our current politics. How some countries send their sons into harms way with no knowledge of the causes they're fighting for and the people they're fighting against, to lose their wars in conflicts no one can win.I was depressed and tired when I finished the book.I guess that's a mark of great writing, that we're made to identify with the characters and their fates remain in our heads and hearts long after we're done with the page."}, {"userName": "Booknblues", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4280875-booknblues", "userReview": "The Blind Man's Garden is a multi-layered book of great complexity which deals with issues of culture, family and religion in a manner to help the reader understand the delicate nature and intricacy of the web these themes create in our world. I am thrilled to discover Nadeem Aslam, the second Pakistani author whom I have fallen in love with this year. Like Exit West's author Mohsin Hamid Aslam write wonderful prose which must be savored. Aslam begins the book:History is the third parent. As Rohan makes his way through the garden, not long after nightfall, a memory comes to him from his son Jeo\u2019s childhood, a memory that slows him and eventually brings him to a standstill. Ahead of him candles are burning in various places at the house because there is no electricity. Wounds are said to emit light under certain conditions\u2014touch them and the brightness will stay on the hands\u2014and as the candles burn Rohan thinks of each flame as an injury somewhere in his house.And that is where I was hooked. As if in a garden Aslim sprinkles the book with images of butterflies, flowers and birds. Do not be fooled by the beautiful prose, this book packs a powerful punch and contains suspense which will have you on the edge of your seat.The story is set shortly after 9/11 at the beginning of the invasion of Afghanistan. It is told through shifting perspective of a number of complex characters and moves back and forth between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Rohan is the blind man of the book, he is a retired Pakistani teacher who still mourns the death of his wife Sophia many years before. Other characters include his daughter in law, Naheed and foster son Mikal, among others.Jeo, Rohan's son, a doctor in training and Mikal travel to Afghanistan to treat the wounded in the new war:The door has opened and both of them have entered the future. Jeo sits in the back of the van with Mikal as they are driven through the shadowland of hill and plateau, the use of headlights kept to a minimum so that at times there is no knowing what lies a mere five seconds into the darkness. Later in the night lightning appears overhead and illuminates not only the earth and the clouds but also the place in the mind where the line of fear crosses the thoughts, and the ground glows blue for a few seconds with a crystal immediacy, vistas opening up as in a vision, with black shapes looming in them, shadows perhaps, perhaps creatures who can be fought only with the weapons forged by the spirit, not the flesh, and then as the night deepens the stars come out and wheel overhead, smearing the sky with ancient phosphorescence.From that early moment in the book everything becomes suspenseful and I found that I couldn't put the book down. It's impact is powerful and I debated between a 4 and 5 star, but I'm sure it will make my top ten of 2017, so it seems it needs to be a 5 and I couldn't put my finger on what might bring it down."}, {"userName": "Loraine Despres", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3010997-loraine-despres", "userReview": "When I finished reading Nadeem Aslam's MAPS FOR LOST LOVERS I felt as if I'd lost a friend, so I downloaded THE BLIND MAN'S GARDEN. The prose is gorgeous in both books, but less dense here and I prefer that. THE BLIND MAN'S GARDEN is the story of the war in Afghanistan as viewed by a cultured, middle-class family in Pakistan. We meet all sides, the medical student son who just wants to take care of the wounded. The young wife he leaves behind, his father, a good, decent man whose religion means everything to him. Jihadists who use their religion as an excuse to torture and kill. War lords who sell innocent boys to the Americans as jihadists for $500. The Americans who take care of their prisoners even as they torture them. I was gripped by what was happening to these poor people until in the last 50 pages Mikal, the clever character, does something so irredeemably stupid and travels around the countryside without a plan. I understood the structural reason for it, but didn't believe that clever character would do that.

Story takes place in Pakistan and Afghanistan right after 9/11, when emotions, outrage, rumors, the need for answers were high. The Blind Man\u2019s Garden deftly handles the themes of ordinary people surviving in a world where power and control are continually shifting yet life has to one with grace and intelligence. Juxtaposing the beauty of nature against the pain of human actions is beautifully written. But, it is the characters that make this story soar and will haunt you after the last page is turned. The range of characters each with their own story as they struggle with balancing their inward beliefs with the outward world is riveting and heartbreaking."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin", "userReview": "Honestly, I kept abandoning this book in favour of others on my Kobo because it was quite difficult to get into. I believe that it was the narrative style in the writing or quite possibly the cookie cutter characters that threw me. I felt that I had to really push myself to see this book through til the end. I would have to say that if the author had taken part 3 of the book and built a storyline about a Pakistani man who is a wanted Taliban fugitive and an injured American Special Forces officer depending on each other as they travel across Pakistan- I would have bought into the story.

Seeping out from beneath the grammar and syntax of his perfectly polished adopted tongue is the melancholy and ache of Urdu\u2019s vivid images and startling metaphors: blood, pomegranates and rubies combine to capture the many inflections of pain, hurt, grief and regret. Moonlight, fireflies, flowering plants and trees, singing birds, the movement of the stars and the color of the sky texture the narrative and act as subliminal triggers which create an emotional subtext connecting the reader to the beauty of Islam\u2019s poetic and artistic traditions.Like grass that grows out of abandoned ruins asserts the triumph of life over death, this is a life-affirming tale of love and redemption emerging from the stark landscape of loss.

Rohan\u2019s garden provides an oasis of calm, respite from the turbulence of the outside world but he also faces an inner struggle.

Also, at times, the author sounds quite orientalistic, as there is a lot of stereotyping and presumption involved in it. In addition to a few main characters, most of the secondary or random ones seem to be motivated by their obsession with jihad or the destruction of America.

Forse la risposta \u00e8 in quei due bambini che nel finale giocano \u201criempiendo di grida l\u2019aria limpida rinfrescata dalla pioggia\u201d.Ma quei bambini sono gi\u00e0 orfani."}, {"userName": "Shaji", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10895962-shaji", "userReview": "You know those lazy Sunday afternoons when you're slumped in front of your television wondering if you should take a quick nap or wash the car, and boom...a bomb has just gone off in Pakistan, injuring and killing a lot of Muslims, innocent bystanders, women and children included.Yet you feel nothing, probably because you've seen this before, again and again, and you've also seen enough footage of what seems like crazed Muslims, Pakistani men, women and children, burning American and British flags, stomping on them while chanting \"Allahu Akbar\". The western media has told one side of the story.Nadeem Aslam now tells the other, through The Blind Man's Garden. If you flipped the channel without a second thought, read this book. To many Asians like me, this book does not change my perception of Muslims just because a few bad apples decided to give Islam a bad name. I have enough Muslim friends, family members and business associates from all over the world (Pakistan included) to know they are (surprise, surprise) exactly like me - moderate, liberal, educated and here's the thing - they don't hate America or Israel, Jews or whites. They are...well, how shall I put it....human beings, with families, girlfriends, bank accounts and 2 pairs of jeans.Nadeem Aslam's book is a must read. There's no better way to tell the story of the ordinary Pakistani and Afghan who are as much a victim of the terror the so-called jihadists continue to wage in the region, as anyone else.The protagonist, Mikal, brings the story full circle when he, quite by 'accident', meets the man who has a bullet with his name on it. Without tearing into a conclusion, Nadeem creates in the reader a sense of anticipation, of hope that one day Mikal will walk right back into Naheed's life, like a dream, through the blind man's garden."}, {"userName": "Manish", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4362792-manish", "userReview": "To my relief, in 'The Blind Man's Garden', Aslam has succeeded in toning down his vivid imagination and focusing more on the story he plans to tell. (unlike what he did with the 'Maps for Lost Lovers'). In this novel set in the immediate days after the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, Mikal accompanies his foster brother Jeo to Afghanistan from Pakistan on a humanitarian mission. Things immediately go awry with Jeo ending up murdered and Mikal being captured. After a series of exchanges between warlords, Mikal ends up in the interrogation chamber of the Americans only to be eventually freed. This freeing of an innocent suspect also ends up with a twist - Mikal ends up inadvertently murdering a couple of US soldiers and ends up a fugitive - this time with little chance for escape. Back home, the novel dwells on the lives of Mikal's foster father, Jeo's widowed wife Naheed (who also turns out to be Mikal's original love interest), Mikal's brother Basie, Basie's wife and others. In my opinion, when one has to willingly suspend disbelief towards appreciating a piece of work, then the author has not achieved his intent to communicate effortlessly. In this novel, this is exactly what happens - the climax with Mikal coming across a wounded Special Ops soldier, his relationship with the deceased Americans and Mikal's eventual role in his rescue made the work a bit hard for me to digest. But irrespective of the flaws, 'The Blind Man's Garden' is an important addition to the literature on the brutal US war and its effects on ordinary lives of whom we know little about."}, {"userName": "Terri Jacobson", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8370501-terri-jacobson", "userReview": "This is a beautifully written, powerful, wonder of a book. Part of it is the story of 9/11 and the \"war on terror\" as seen from a Muslim point of view. And part of it is the story of a close-knit Muslim family and how they cope with the changes in their world. The author, Nadeem Aslam, has written several major books and has won numerous awards. After reading this book, I can certainly see why. The prose is musical, lyrical, a real pleasure to read. The story is compelling and suspenseful. The characters are wonderfully drawn, I came to care deeply about them. I loved every aspect of this book. I'm very curious about Islam, and I have done a lot of reading on the subject. This book gave me new insights. I think it's always interesting to read about the role of women, both real and ideal, in these societies.

It focuses on one family, but the story it tells explains a part of the world that we know so little about at the day top day family level. Everything is in there--the poverty, the richness of life, family, war, peace, religion, traditions, education, Taliban, pride, guilt, life, death and, above all, survival. The prose is very lyrical, boarding on poetic, but that does not soften the blow of the violence these characters are subjected to (or subject others to). It isn't an easy read, but it is one that I highly recommend.

You take in his words and breathe what he has to say. You are aware of the political undertones in his books. At times, you also may not like what you read. You might also detest some parts. You will yell in happiness when something good happens to one of his characters. You want to keep the book aside and you will not be able to, because that is the power of his books. You will ignore everything else and read on, because Aslam has a story to tell and his characters will talk to you. They will make you believe and sometimes make you cry and live as well. \u201cThe Blind Man\u2019s Garden\u201d according to me is one of the best books that Aslam has written. I have read all his books and while all his books have the much needed political angle; this one to me is most emotional and heart-wrenching in a lot of places. I interviewed Nadeem Aslam at the Jaipur Literature Festival this year (which will be a different post) and he was so passionate about the book and the way he spoke with me. The book almost came alive through him. All his characters and the situations he put them through almost seemed surreal and believable. For me that is the craft of a great storyteller. \u201cThe Blind Man\u2019s Garden\u201d makes you feel and think about humans and what does war do to them. He gets into the heart of his characters and makes them speak for themselves. He makes them tell their stories, their lives spread across the canvas of his landscape, of time unknown and sometimes time is of great essence. This is precisely why I cannot help myself but mark almost every other line on every other page of an Aslam novel. Jeo and his foster-brother Mikal leave their home in a small Pakistani city not to fight with the Taliban but to help care for the wounded victims. The Western Armies have invaded Afghanistan and the brothers only want to help the wounded, whether Afghani or the Americans. They only want to help and yet they get embroiled deep into the war as its unwilling soldiers. At the same time left behind is Jeo\u2019s wife and her superstitious mother, and their father Rohan, who is slowly but surely turning blind. The war is seen through from all perspectives and that is the crux of the story. For me everything worked in the book. The writing is sharp and hits in places that you would not expect it to. The past and the present situations merge beautifully throughout the entire narrative. In fact, what I loved the most about the book was the way the structure was built and at the same time the prose seemed very fluid, as though it was waiting to flow through the reader\u2019s mind and heart. The heart of the book is about everything surrounding the war \u2013 lost children, grieving parents, hopeful wives and children who are left behind wondering when their fathers will return. Despite all this, what strings the book together is hope, which is unending and everlasting.There are a lot of sub-elements and plots to the book (which I will not spoil for you) that add to the beauty of this wonderfully written novel. There is beauty and at the same time there is this sharp ache and a prayer that all should go well for the characters that you have come to known while reading the book. As a reader, I found myself hoping that all went well. Such is the power of this magnificent read. It is for sure one of the best I will read this year. Here are some quotes from the book: \u201cHistory is a third parent.\u201d \u201cThe logic is that there are no innocent people in a guilty nation.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cbut before they lose, they harm the good people. That is what I am afraid of.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Ev", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11277078-ev", "userReview": "This is possibly the most beautiful book I have read. I was hesitant and annoyed as I began, until I realized it was simply a reaction to the unwonted emotion it was provoking within me.Tangent: I believe the author, Nadeem Aslam, totally knows how to traverse between two worlds and woo British ladies at various and exponential, promotional cocktail hours - whereby he is an under-the-radar guest of honor, sincerely weaving his way into their naive pants like a water moccasin. He seems sumptuous, yet willfully ignorant of his own seductiveness; attempting to elicit a mien of pure intent. Perhaps his desire is motivated by love in the moment, but he hedonistically ignores its real consequences.Back to the review...I cried four times while reading this book. At least 3 out of 4 of the times had to do with love persisting through the tragic inevitability of death; beauty in raw pain. The book made me examine my own personal definition of art: anything that elicits a cathartic response from its audience, consumer, or creator. Objectively, many critics analyze a work of art for its sophistication of construction; the infrastructure of gentility; the technical craft of a wordsmith. Patience and effort in chaos imbue color into cracked lips. There is a dichotomy in privilege and repression; the master is beholden to the captor. Basically, art is complicated, and perhaps the critic can never be objective.In reading this book I realized peace is power, vulnerability is growth; the author's opinion of the world is simply his emotion, which is frustratingly universal, inconclusive and soaked up like a sponge. In this book I have realized that I am learning, and not everything that I have learned is useful to everyone. The truth is penetrating and frustrating; raw and unyielding; life is synergy through destruction. Through this book, I am ironically reminded that we will always learn while fully present to one another; we will always be catalyzed by standing as witness to the universe in another's eyes; exhalation and inhalation between two souls, than we ever will in solitary contemplation.I wholeheartedly wish this literary work to be translated to film."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8258265-jonathan", "userReview": "This was great. It is set in Afghanistan and Pakistan during the months following 9/11. The story begins when Jeo and Mikhal leave Pakistan to join in the war in Afghanistan, one to help with the wounded, the other to fight. They leave behind members of their family who are unaware of their reasons for leaving until after they are gone. Almost from the beginning things go wrong for the young men, and at home problems begin to arise for the rest of the family.The book is very well constructed, fast paced where it needs to be, moving throughout, and not afraid to show the brutality of the war from all sides. It does not preach, but does show how ordinary people are caught up in the conflict, how they have a lack of control over their lives, even when they think they are in control, and the results are pretty devastating.This is the first novel I have read that is directly about the war in Afghanistan, and I am so glad I read it.

Just some of the concepts were the husband who denied his wife medication expediting her death so that she would be a better muslim, the conflict between jihad and main stream-muslims, poverty used against a people for political purposes, how shunning of education can be used to brainwash people, prisoner of war torture and trying to get information when you don't know who is on what side, the use of sacred objects or symbols by a culture that doesn't understand them, the fact that war effects all people and there is not necessarily a \"right\" side, and obviously just very confusing cultural differences between peoples.

Jeo and Mikal are foster brothers from a small town in Pakistan. Though they were inseparable as children, their adult lives have diverged: Jeo is a dedicated medical student, married a year; Mikal has been a vagabond since he was fifteen, in love with a woman he can\u2019t have. But when Jeo decides to sneak across the border into Afghanistan\u2014not to fight with the Taliban against the Americans, rather to help care for wounded civilians\u2014Mikal determines to go with him, to protect him.  Yet Jeo\u2019s and Mikal\u2019s good intentions cannot keep them out of harm\u2019s way. As the narrative takes us from the wilds of Afghanistan to the heart of the family left behind\u2014their blind father, haunted by the death of his wife and by the mistakes he may have made in the name of Islam and nationhood; Mikal\u2019s beloved brother and sister-in-law; Jeo\u2019s wife, whose increasing resolve helps keep the household running, and her superstitious mother\u2014we see all of these lives upended by the turmoil of war.
