RJ is a character with whom it is easy to relate. Or, he is at least entertaining to watch. The story weaves through his trials and tribulations and you can't help but root for him.I couldn't help but feel that there were a few spots towards the end of the book that would have made good stopping points for the novel. I was less enchanted with the last parts of the book and found RJ to be a bitter soul and not quite as likable as he was in the first part.Still, it was an entertaining read and the few typos were not too much of a distraction."}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7261653-kris", "userReview": "This is a good and imaginative story but I found the grammatical errors very distracting. Sometimes I had to puzzle over what the author was really trying to say (i.e.,\"high fluting\"). With a good editor to smooth out the style errors this could become a 4-star read."}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5543878-philip", "userReview": "This novel really worked for me. It made me laugh; it made me cry; it made me laugh while I was crying - all that. RJ is a great character; he's super engaging and likable most of the time so when he does something wrong or uncool I more ache for him to fix things more than get frustrated with him. And he isn't perfect; which really is probably good or the story likely would have gotten old after a while.On the contrary, I just wanted the novel to continue forever. Every time the narrative skipped forward a bit I wished it would go back and fill in the gaps even if the events weren't as life-changing as the others.Around RJ were all the people he dealt with in his life and all of them were wonderful. Even the ones who weren't particularly developed or anything were still interesting enough that I didn't mind them interfering and being present in RJ's life. Even Cosmo and Elliot entertained me.The writing was really powerful. A lot happened in RJ's life and a lot of it moved me, for better or worse. I don't really know how to articulate it besides saying that it just really got to me. The writing took everything that happened to RJ and made me feel it.Perhaps the only thing that I might point out as not being fantastic was the narrative with regards to RJ's sight. There were many times that RJ or someone commented on how terrible it is/must be to be able to see everyone's death but the story never really made me consider it or feel like I experienced it at all. Besides the times that it more directly affected RJ's life in the story, it was easy to forget about and not experience the rest with that overshadowing it all.And now I'll avoid going on about how I feel about all the things in the novel as I occasionally do with my reviews (I wish I read these books with other people...) and instead just finish by saying that I really liked the ending. Not even just the epilogue but the last couple chapters into that just all were a fantastic way to end the amazing novel. I was reading it on a train sitting next to someone so I needed to frequently put my kindle down and look out the window a little while to settle down and not have too visceral of a reaction to it. This book in whole was just marvelous."}, {"userName": "Teresa ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7494684-teresa", "userReview": "Bravo, DC Hicks! I was thoroughly entertained. I was drawn in by RJ's character within the first few pages of the book, and shared his life's journey with him--sometimes crying, sometimes laughing, and always rooting for him. What a bittersweet rags to riches tale, and a fantastic time capsule. I'd place CATCHING THE WESTBOUND on my book shelf between FOREST GUMP and WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.Here, I feel compelled to mention that I did read on other reviews that there were editing issues with the book. I was unaware since I used Kindle text-to-speech to read the story to me, thus, with the MC's dialect, it would have been difficult to know if the author had made an error. I gave it five stars in spite of editing issues--based on story alone. If there are editing issues, I hope the author reissues the book with corrections made. It'd be a shame to have technical issues dog such stellar storytelling."}, {"userName": "David A.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14098678-david-a", "userReview": "Gypsies tramps and thieves scallywags, dandies and all the trappings of Mark Twain, John Steinbeck in the making of a nation, the rebuilding of a life and a man\u2026 D.C.

Catching the Westbound by D.C. Hicks is one of those gifts.R.J. Watkins was born with the ability to see how people will die. It's a curse to R.J. as it is constantly clouding his mind with gruesome thoughts and scary visions of things to come. In his tenth year of life he gets the vision that the mine where his dad and most of the town's men work will collapse. He runs through the groups of miners warning them as they trudge to the opening of the mine to begin their day. Some listen and others brush him off and head into the depths of the mountain.Just as R.J. had predicted the mine collapses killing many people. The mine owner accuses R.J. of causing the collapse and since the town is emotional and in mourning the story catches on. In order to save R.J. from danger his father sends his 10 year old son out into the world with the following advice, \"Run until nobody knows your name.\"R.J. makes plans to hop a train and ride it away from the danger of his hometown. His young friend Benny refuses to let him go alone so the two boys hop a freight train and head for the great unknown.Along the way R.J. and Benny encounter many dangers but also are taken under the wing of a tough hobo named Red. Misfortune soon frowns on the trio and the group must split up and go their separate ways. The remainder of the book follows R.J's rise through the social ladder in New York due to an encounter with a very rich man. R.J. makes himself a mover and shaker in the financial scene and must hide his past.The path that R.J. takes is a winding one and it has many pitfalls but also leads him to the love of his life. This book is an adventure and romance all rolled into one. In the end R.J. realizes what is most important in life. This book was a quick read because it drew me in and I cared about the characters from the get go. It was long enough to tell the story without a lot of missing pieces and the story is easy to follow even with all of the topsy turvy twists the main character's life takes."}, {"userName": "Marcus", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9976397-marcus", "userReview": "This is an odd book/novel to begin with. You will ask yourself, what have I attempted to read? Give yourself a little time and a couple of more pages and the book will draw you in. The characters are well written and not there for the fluff, the situations are ones that could have existed at or during that particular time frame, the reactions of the characters are ones that could have reasonably been expected, and the later years of the main character's actions also could have been reasonably expected. A good book to read."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9614754-kim", "userReview": "I finished reading the Kindle version and will be purchasing a hardcopy when available. It was a very well paced story that kept me coming back every chance I had a free moment. Having family from KY, I know some folks like R.J. and are proud to have them. Faults and all, they make life interesting just as R.J. did in this story. Through life's ups and downs, we are along for the ride.

Watkins was banished from his small Appalachian community after being unjustly accused of igniting a mining accident. With a little help from fellow riders of the rails, R.J. learned how to survive on his own, but eventually his train came to rest with the Benton and Walters Best Show in America, where R.J. cultivated his unusual talents.At seventeen, R.J. answered another whistle call of destiny, and he met the powerful McClennan family. Like a dazzling display of fireworks to their fourth of July picnic, R.J. provided the perfect blend of flavor for their family that had long since grew stale. But when he had hard time adjusting to the lavish extremes of the East Coast high society, R.J. learned to navigate their foreign world by completely transforming himself. A metamorphosis so complete that within a few short years he was the talk of the town, a man he barely recognized. Still all the talk was for naught because with the closing bell on a single autumn day in 1929, the McClennan fortune, which took generations to amass, was gone. To stop the head-on collision with destitution, McClennan\u2019s eldest son, Cosmo, made a deal with a devil, but it fell upon R.J. to pay the dues. No longer able to afford the luxury of other\u2019s opinions, R.J. shed his finer sensibilities and used every trick he learned along the way to save his new family. Will his efforts be enough or ultimately destroy them? From majestic corners hidden deep within the mountains to New York City\u2019s finest ballrooms, Catching the Westbound chronicles the triumphs and tragedies of R.J. Watkins, a boy who came from nothing but with unparalleled determination, will, and resilience became the last great pioneer of industry. After a lifetime of traveling paths of decadence and despair, by grace alone, he discovered the road that would lead him home.", "title": "Catching the Westbound", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15700525-catching-the-westbound", "average": 4.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405976422l/15700525.jpg", "reviews": 35, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6420841.D_C_Hicks", "name": "D.C.
