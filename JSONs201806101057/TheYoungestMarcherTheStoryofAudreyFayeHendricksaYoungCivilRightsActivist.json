Everyone rates each book and adds a comment and it may (or may not) affect my overall rating. This is book #2 of 2017.Tara: 5 stars. Very moving. Sad. Important.Harry (12): 4 stars. I like the viewpoint of the little girl.Hank (11): 4 stars. I like how in the end it turned out well. They did it. Amazing book!Lyra (10): Very bold and beautiful. Go Audrey!! So powerful to see that a kid like Audrey could be a part of ending segregation.Dave: 4 stars. The true story of Audrey Faye Henderson, one of 3-4,000 children actually arrested from May 2-7, 1963 as part of the (brilliantly conceived) Children's March in Birmingham, Alabama as part of the efforts to desegregate the city. This is a children's picture book, with a focus on what kids can do to join a resistance, so some of the wider aspects of the struggle are elided, but we do hear of what it was actually like for her to be in the jail, even for a time in isolation. It's short. I wanted more of the story. But a timeline is added to put the struggle in context: *June 19, 1963 President John F Kennedy submitted a civil rights bill to congress*July 23, 1963 Birmingham rescinded its segregation policies*September 15, 1963 4 little girls are killed in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church*July 1, 1964 Congress passes the Civil Rights ActAnd today, well, the struggle continues, about which those people taking a knee in games (and those angry about those taking a knee at games) is symbolic."}, {"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221050-betsy", "userReview": "Today I\u2019d like to begin with a small talk about diversity. Not diversity of people necessarily, but diversity of style. Illustration styles, if we\u2019re going to get right down to it. For a long time there has been a single prevalent style used when dealing with historical picture books featuring African Americans. It varies from case to case, but generally speaking, for decades, the only way publishers felt comfortable putting out nonfiction picture books on serious subjects was to have them illustrated with realistic illustrations. There are always exceptions to this rule ( We March by Shane W. Evans or The Amazing Age of John Roy Lynch being two such examples) but by and large realism is considered the only appropriate form. After the protests surrounding  A Fine Dessert and  A Birthday Cake for George Washington I expected this situation to become even more prevalent. After all, those two books were not done in a serious style, and that fact was inseparable from their other issues. So it is with great relief that I view a book like The Youngest Marcher by Cynthia Levinson. Not just because it dares to include less realistic images with a serious tale, but also because illustrator Vanessa Brantley Newton returns to form with a book bound to be remembered in the pantheon of historical child heroes.She was nine-years-old in 1963. The year that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. came to Birmingham, AL. The year the Children\u2019s March made headlines because it had a single purpose: Fill the jails with children. Fill them until they burst. It was a bold proposition but there were a lot of kids willing to do their part. Most of them were high school students . . . and then there was Audrey Faye Hendricks. Armed only with a board game and the clothes on her back, Audrey was jailed for a full week alongside the other children at the protest. There she suffered loneliness, intimidation from the guards, and even interrogations. In the end she returned home to her loving family, the youngest protestor in the March itself, and she dedicated her life thereafter to educating schools and students on what the Civil Rights Movement really was. A Time Line, Recipe for \u201cHot Rolls Baptized in Butter\u201d and a list of Sources are included at the end.Child heroes are kind of author Cynthia Levinson\u2019s thing. As I was preparing this review I figured I\u2019d knock out the readalikes beforehand. So I kept thinking to myself, \u201cWhat was that other book about the child marchers again? I know it was a chapter book, and a lot older than Youngest Marcher but what was the title? Ah! It was  We\u2019ve Got a Job and it was by . . . Cynthia Levinson. Ditto her book, Watch Out for Flying Kids: How Two Circuses, Two Countries, and Nine Kids Confront Conflict and Build Community. If Cynthia has a m\u00e9tier, it is this. She is entranced by proactive kids with impetus that their lives in their own hands. In The Youngest Marcher Levinson writes for a younger audience, but she tackles the story in an interesting way. Since this is a book about a heroic child, why not really put child readers into Audrey\u2019s shoes? As a result, the scenes in which Audrey sits in jail display of a certain strain of loneliness that a lot of kids will empathize with. After all, no one else in jail was her age, and all the teenagers (being teenagers) just wanted to talk with their friends all the time. And when she is hauled into an interrogation room with four angry white men the text tells us clear as day, \u201cShe\u2019d never talked to a white man before.\u201d Heck of a way to begin. Is there any kid out there that relishes the idea of being the only kid in a room with four angry men? I thought not.The danger in writing any review about a nonfiction picture book set during the Civil Rights Era is to compliment it by disparaging similar titles. It is the lazy form of reviewing. To say, \u201cThis is good because these books are not\u201d, isn\u2019t adding any content or value to readers. In light of this, I want to point out everything Ms. Levinson does right and emphasize at the same time how difficult her job really is. First off, she has to make clear to readers precisely what segregation really was. Next, she has to quickly and concisely add that to other trials facing African-Americans at the time (job discrimination, the Klan, and police brutality in three sentences!). After that there\u2019s historical accuracy. Does she use fake dialogue at any point in the book? She does not, and her solution to faking the dialogue is keen. When people think something and it\u2019s the thoughts of a group then the terms are not placed in quotation marks but italics. The author also has to be capable of writing well. A hack job isn't going to describe the voice of Martin Luther King Jr. as having, \"a voice as taut as steel cables, as smooth as glass...\" That takes the work of a real writer. And finally you need just one more thing - a good illustrator.Full Disclosure: I\u2019ve loved the work of Vanessa Brantley Newton for years. I loved her work on  Drum City first and foremost, and kept a sharp eye on her from then on. When Ms. Newton first started illustrating children\u2019s picture books she was one of a very few African-American female illustrators working in the States. These days she has a little more company (though certainly not enough). Her style is upbeat, diverse, and in the past she was the go-to person for, say, a Bob Marley song adapted into picture book form. Her work on A Birthday Cake for George Washington is, unfortunately, what she is best known for today. At the time of its publication I remember saying that she was the wrong illustrator for the piece. Much of the fault of that book lay with the author and editor too, but I wondered if it would have made a difference if a Floyd Cooper or Elizabeth Zunon had taken it in hand. I now think it was slated for failure no matter what happened, but Ms. Newton took the bulk of the blame at the time. So in many ways, The Youngest Marcher feels like a triumphant return. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s changed her style. Cheer is cheer and there is always hope in darkness, but in this book the dark pall of Jim Crow isn\u2019t relegated to the wings but center stage. We\u2019re all trying to figure out these days how much or how little is appropriate to tell or show our young readers. There\u2019s no guidebook out there. No set of rules that ordains that one subject is fine and another verboten. Every single editor, author, and illustrator has to feel their way through each book as they work on it. For The Youngest Marcher, the three probably had a number of conversations about how dark to go, particularly in the art. As a result, there\u2019s a moment when someone says they were chased by the Klan. Newton creates not just an adult fleeing but children as well. There\u2019s a point where Audrey has to sleep on a bare mattress with just a sheet. But that mattress isn\u2019t some smooth, sweet ride but a filthy, stained affair with stuffing poking through and the occasional spring. There are interrogations, and a moment when she\u2019s threatened with isolation, and there\u2019s a shot of her sitting alone in her cell that\u2019ll rip out the heart of any parent that sees it. But in the midst of this dark content, Newton\u2019s art mediates the fear a kid might feel at viewing these images. Undoubtedly that was why she was hired. In this book she treats her subject matter with respect and ends up being darned kid-friendly in the process.Actually, I mentioned before that Ms. Newton hasn\u2019t changed her style, and for the most part that\u2019s correct. But she has expanded it a bit. In this book you will find silhouettes (as when Martin Luther King Jr. is speaking so all can hear), collage (the television made out of French newspapers was a clever way of showing that the world was watching), and the cool curlicues of water as they surround children on the receiving ends of fire hoses. And can we please pay attention to the sheer range of skin tones at work here? Again, I\u2019m not going to rip on other illustrators. I\u2019m just going to say that if you are displaying an average African-American church in 1963 Birmingham, AL and you portray everyone in that church as the same shade of brown, that\u2019s a very different kind of inauthenticity at work. I wonder if child readers today have a better sense of Civil Rights marchers and what they went through today than the children of ten, twenty, or thirty years ago. Thanks to a significant uptick in protest marches against the Trump administration, a lot of children have at this point participated with their own parents. For those kids, this book gives them something they know (protest) and then takes it to the next level. That said, you don\u2019t have to be a child protester to get something out of this story. It is not cloying. It is not cute. It is, however, infinitely readable. Thanks to its creators it proves that you can be kid-friendly and honest to history at the same time. It is not easy but it is possible. Heck, that could be the motto of what Audrey did in the first place. It wasn\u2019t easy. But it was possible.For ages 6-10."}, {"userName": "Marie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51069187-marie", "userReview": "This inspirational biography is about the courage of 9 year old Audrey Faye Hendricks and her role in the Civil Rights Movement. Audrey grew up in Birmingham, Alabama at a time when black people could not be served food in the same room at restaurants together. The year is 1963 and black children went to different schools and had hand-me-down textbooks from the white students. Audrey did not feel this was fair and when Dr. Martin Luther King visited their church, she wanted to be part of the solution. His call to \u201cfill the jails\u201d was heeded by children, as part of the Children\u2019s March (May 1963). Audrey was arrested and spent a week in juvenile hall. Two months later Birmingham rescinded its segregation ordinances. This book does an excellent job of portraying the childhood figure of Audrey, her home life, and her tremendous courage and heroism at such a young age fighting for what she believed in. This is an amazing book that reminds us how recent in history these events occurred. This book brought up great questions and discussion from my kids.

Have acess to brand-new books in the library. Be able to drink from a fountain with clean water and pay her fare on the bus and not have to get back out to reenter from the back door. So when children volunteered to march and be arrested on May 2, 1963, Audrey was there. Armed only with her board game and her beliefs, she was arrested and at nine years old, was the youngest to be brought to jail. This is her story.WOW! I have just read one of the BEST books of 2017. Audrey Faye Hendricks was just 9 years old when she volunteered to march in the Children's Crusades in Birmingham, Alabama. Birmingham was heavily segregated and while the adults did protest, it did not amount to much. That is when Jim Bevel, Fred Shuttleworth and Martin Luther King Jr. came up with the Children's Crusades, where they called upon children to march and fill the jails. Fill them so there was no more room to encarcerate anyone else. There was no shorage of volunteers. On the assigned day, children showed up by the thousands to fight for their rights. A powerful, moving and incredible book.The background for this book is just incredible. I am ashamed to admit that this is the first time I have heard about Audrey and the 1963 Children's March in Birmingham. It was daring for leaders to ask children to fill the jails and even more so that children were willing. This is one of the bravest acts I have ever heard about. At 9 years, Audrey was the yougest in record to be arrested. She spent a week in jail (Audrey sure does put most adults to shame). It is estimated that about 4000 children marched and at least 1000 of them were jailed. It was not in vain. Due to their bravery, two months later, Segregation laws were overturned in Birmingham. And Audrey did not stop there. She volunteered to integrate the highschool, went to college and came back to Birmingham to work with children of low income families. Her thesis that earned her Masters Degree was about women active in the Civil Rights Movement. Sadly, she died in 2009 but she will forever remain a beacon in the Civil Rights Movement. A must read."}, {"userName": "Cindy Hudson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903478-cindy-hudson", "userReview": "Audrey Faye Hendricks was the youngest known child to be arrested during a civil rights protest in Birmingham, Alabama. Her story is told in a picture book, The Youngest Marcher: The Story of Audrey Faye Hendricks, a Young Civil Rights Activist, by Cynthia Levinson.The year was 1963, when Audrey was nine. She had heard her parents and other grownups talk about the unfairness of racial segregation and ask for people to protest. Understandably, many people were afraid of being hurt and arrested and didn\u2019t want to put their families at risk.When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. asked children to march, Audrey volunteered right away. She was arrested and spent one frightening week in juvenile hall. Others, mostly teens in high school, joined her over the week until the cells were full. Two months after her ordeal, Birmingham erased its segregation laws.Today it\u2019s hard to imagine the time when blacks weren\u2019t allowed to drink from the same water fountains as whites, couldn\u2019t sit in the same sections of restaurants, use the same elevators, or sit downstairs at a movie theater. It\u2019s also hard to imagine the courage of a nine year old protesting when she knew she would be arrested, or that her parents allowed her to take action. Which is why picture books about children like Audrey are so important. They let young readers know that even children like them can make a difference when they stand up for something they know to be right.Vanessa Brantley Newton\u2019s illustrations show Audrey as she was, a young, curious, happy child with a determination to change things she knew to be wrong. An author\u2019s note about Audrey\u2019s time in jail and The Children\u2019s March followed by a timeline of other events puts Audrey\u2019s actions in historical perspective.

She did a good job of showing joy and hope at the end also and I was surprised to see the collage of real hot rolls in butter.My kids had lots of questions about this book - which is always a good sign.

What a brave child! But then, she had so many good examples to follow--Martin Luther King, Jr. was a regular dinner guest at her house (lucky her!). She was the youngest child to participate in 1963 children's civil rights march, though I couldn't find anywhere in the book where it stated her age at the time, just that she attended Center Street Elementary School. She knew she would likely be arrested and spend time in jail, yet that never deterred her. She took a board game with her to pass the time in jail, and carried a sign like all the others. However, jail was a bit rougher and scarier than she'd imagined. None of the other, older girls would talk to her, and she was interrogated and fed greasy grits day after day. It was all worth it, though, when the jails were full to the point where they couldn't arrest anyone else because there was no place to put them, and two months later Birmingham was desegregated. Levinson included a photo and information about Audrey at the end of the book. I wish I could have met her! Vanessa Brantley Newton's illustrations were just right for this story. She captured Audrey's essence perfectly. My favorite picture is the one at the end, where Audrey is eating ice cream at the Newberry's counter alongside white people. Such an inspiring story! Audrey belongs with Malala Yousafzai and Iqbal Masih in the ranks of brave children who tried to make a difference. Outstanding and highly recommended!!"}, {"userName": "Olivia Bunemann", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76212354-olivia-bunemann", "userReview": "Genre: Biography Grade Level: K-4th This book is a wonderful story about a little girl named Audrey Hendricks, a Civil Rights Activist. \u201cThe Youngest Marcher\u201d by Cynthia Levinson tells the story of Audrey a young African American girl and the impact she made during the Civil Rights Movement. Audrey was very curious of the difference in rights between herself and white people. She was passionate about standing up for what she thought she deserved even when it was not something she was allowed to do. Although her mother was afraid to let Audrey take a stand, she made a huge impact along with others towards desegregation. There are many uses for this book in an elementary classroom. The first way is to incorporate this into the study of the Civil Rights Movement. Many books and article portray the Civil Rights Movement as a violent time. I think it is important to show students that there were African American people who were peacefully protested and still made progress. I also think that Audrey Hendricks is a great example of a change maker. We often give children this idea that heroes or role models are these amazing people that are one in a million. It is very important that students see that they can make a positive impact on something with being as young as they are. The last way I believe this can be used in the classroom is through a writing activity. Students are able to write about a time where they stood up for something they believed in peacefully whether they were successful or not. This was a Wow Book for me because of the bravery Audrey Hendricks showed. She was such a brave person at only nine years old and she shows the rest of us how much of an impact we can make. She shows everyone to be strong and stand up for what you believe in."}], "description": "Meet the youngest known child to be arrested for a civil rights protest in Birmingham, Alabama, 1963, in this moving picture book that proves you\u2019re never too little to make a difference.Nine-year-old Audrey Faye Hendricks intended to go places and do things like anybody else.So when she heard grown-ups talk about wiping out Birmingham\u2019s segregation laws, she spoke up.
