He had the feeling that the trees were peering in through the windows, that they had uprooted and crept over to take a peek. The leaves of the banana tree on the roof were a gentle tap tap tap let me in\u201d After the Fire, a Still Small Voice is the first novel by prize-winning Anglo-Australian author, Evie Wyld. A story that spans three generations, it is told from the perspective of Frank, who, in the present day, is fleeing behaviour he is ashamed of; and of Leon, decades earlier, forced to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. Frank arrives at Mulaburry, determined that life in his grandparents\u2019 hut in the cane-fields will help him forget Lucy, the woman he mistreated. \u201cThe clearing was smaller than he remembered, like the cane had slunk closer to the pale wooden box hut. The banana tree stooped low over a corrugated roof\u201d.Having watched the broken remains of his father, once a master baker, return from the Korean War, Leon finds himself plucked from his own baking career to land in the jungles of Vietnam.Wyld alternates the narratives so that the significant events of each man\u2019s life are gradually revealed, and the reader learns how one man\u2019s history impacts on that of the other. There are common elements to each narrative, echoes that draw the stories together: the wedding-cake figurines, the baker\u2019s fare, the cane-fields hut.Wyld\u2019s characters are real and flawed, characters for whom the reader can readily hope, be disappointed in and exult in minor triumphs. Their moods are deftly evoked: \u201cWith effort he stood up, ignored the squealed noises of the teacher, the weird electric sound of laughter, saw only that Amy Blackwell\u2019s blue eyes watched him as he walked out of the classroom, away from the school, heavy enough that he might sink into the ground and suffocate, or else fall on the pavement and shatter into splinters\u201dWyld touches on some topical and age-old issues: domestic violence; child abduction; the devastating effect of war on the combatants\u2019 psyche; the lack of support for Vietnam Veterans; racial discrimination. Wyld has a talent for descriptive prose and conveys her settings with consummate ease: the humidity of the Vietnamese jungle, the sounds of the Queensland cane-field, the langour of a Sydney Christmas, all are vividly heard, seen and felt. A stunning debut."}, {"userName": "Sonja", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4436063-sonja", "userReview": "[Her abduction also carries the most tension as a subplot.

In the intervening months, After the Fire, a Still Small Voice has won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, and received near-unanimous praise \u2013 now here\u2019s some more.What\u2019s particularly striking about the novel, looking back on it as a whole, is how quiet it is; it\u2019s probably the quietest book I\u2019ve read all year. Its tone is quiet, its theme is quietness \u2013 the things that aren\u2019t said, and the possible consequences of not saying them. Wyld\u2019s debut is a character study revolving around two men: one is Frank, who leaves his life in present-day Canberra to live in a remote shack his grandparents owned, and hopes that the past will stay where he left it. The second man is Leon, whom we follow from childhood: his father leaves home to fight in the Korean War, but struggles with life when he returns, so much so that he ends up fleeing. Leon\u2019s mother goes in search of her husband, leaving the young man to cope on his own \u2013 and then Leon receives a letter of conscription for Vietnam. Leon, by the way, is Frank\u2019s father.Typing that last sentence almost feels like a spoiler, though there\u2019s no real reason why it should. It\u2019s not that Wyld is keeping the relationship secret to provide a surprise twist; rather, it\u2019s that the story she tells never demands the connection be stated. The two narratives are kept separate, and there\u2019s a gap between the young Leon and the father we glimpse in Frank\u2019s tale (we can speculate on what drives Leon to become the man he is in the present, but we don\u2019t have the full story). In effect, the central father-son relationship of the novel is hardly in the novel at all \u2013 the theme of silence between men (and between generations of men) is reflected at the broadest structural level.That same theme is also there at the level of plot, as both protagonists have to deal with the consequences of things left unspoken. Frank doesn\u2019t reveal much about himself to the people of his new town, which comes back to bite him before novel\u2019s end; and Leon finds it hard to talk to his father when the latter returns from service \u2013 even after so long apart, silence around the dinner table seems more appropriate than facile questions that could never reveal the truth of what Leon\u2019s father witnessed.There\u2019s silence, too, in the very language of the book. This is a novel in which sensations seem more prominent than actions. Wyld is a great writer of description; here, for example, is Leon after hearing that his father has been caught:At school things caught at his hair and plucked at the back of his trousers. His pen moved slowly across the page, ink swelled into the paper. He felt himself trapped between the bone and flesh of his face, and he couldn\u2019t move. Everyone else\u2019s hands moved at impossible speed over their work, the noises of the classroom were high-pitched and speeded up, made no sense. He felt his own body, a sluggish weight, pale and thick, a rock with a wooden shell. With effort he stood up\u2026he walked out of the classroom, away from the school, heavy enough that he might sink into the ground and suffocate, or else fall on the pavement and shatter into splinters.After the Fire is full of such vivid imagery (of place as well as of feeling) that jumps out; but there are also highly significant points which come across as relatively subdued. For example, when we first learn that Frank beat his wife, it\u2019s dropped in casually; one might even have to go back and re-read, just to check that\u2019s what has been revealed. Character hints are dropped in subtly, suggesting that these are things the protagonist don\u2019t know about themselves. Frank doesn\u2019t know why he gets so aggressive, for example; nor does Leon understand what makes him want to photograph a boy he kills in Vietnam \u2013 and we don\u2019t comprehend the minds of these characters, either. Though we see the novel through their eyes, there is still much they don\u2019t (or can\u2019t) tell us.I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019d go so far as to call Frank and Leon antiheroes; but they\u2019re not entirely sympathetic protagonists, either. What we have here, I think, is a portrait of two flawed men trying to cope with life\u2019s challenges the best they can \u2013 which isn\u2019t necessarily the best way there could be. After the Fire, a Still Small Voice tells a very real story; and, quiet though it may be, it\u2019s a novel that resounds loudly."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1758411-lisa", "userReview": "A most impressive debut by a very talented writer. Evie Wyld identifies herself as English, but there is an Australian sensibility about this novel that derives from her long acquaintance with this country. It\u2019s not just the superb evocation of our landscape, it\u2019s also Wyld\u2019s familiarity with the way Aussie blokes bottle up their emotions as if to let them loose is to fail a test of male identity. This is a novel about the intergenerational damage done by war, explored from that curious Australian perspective, one that is blind to the histories of refugees and migrants who come here from war-torn places, but is acutely sensitive to the ANZAC myth and its successors.To see the rest of my review please visit http://anzlitlovers.wordpress.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Violet wells", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells", "userReview": "Strange choice of subject matter for a first time young female novelist. Evie Wyld has chosen to write a novel about male worlds as rudimentary and imminently violent as the landscapes in which her novel is set. Clearly a choice that took her way outside all her comfort zones. I\u2019m not convinced it was the right choice as, for me, she never quite appeared in command of her characters or her story. The story alternates between a father and a son. Except the father is always shown younger than the son, which is interesting. However it\u2019s as if the father begins to elude Wyld half way through the novel and his sections become shorter and shorter and the architecture becomes increasingly uneven when Leon is sent to Vietnam. Vietnam isn\u2019t convincing. Nor is the defining animosity the son appears to feel for the father. In fact often her characterisation of males seems a bit stereotypical and simplistic. What she can do however is write incredibly well. My favourite character was Sal, a female waif and child of nature and my favourite sections of the book are when Leon is making his cakes. Wyld\u2019s insightful sensitivity to sensibility shines through here, making it even more odd that she chooses to almost exclusively focus on characters who largely shun sensibility. After the Fire is more of a promising novel than an exciting or satisfying one. But there\u2019s enough brilliance here to make me want to read her next novel."}, {"userName": "Garry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4480042-garry", "userReview": "Present day... Frank has left Sydney for small-town Queensland. A generation ago... Leon leaves Sydney after being conscripted to fight in Vietnam.After the Fire tells the story of these two men. Chapter 1 Frank, Chapter 2 Leon, Chapter 3 Frank, Chapter 4 Leon, Chapter 5 Frank.... oh, you get the drift. The format is reassuringly consistent.Let me start with the good stuff, the reasons I've given this book 3 stars. First and foremost, the writing is beautiful - there's a good reason that this has garnered the attention of awards judges. The prose was evocative without being intrusive. It was a pleasure to read.Next on the good side was the message I got out of it, although it might not have been the message that the author had intended. About how the petty dramas of our normal days seem more massive than they should when compared side-by-side with the devastation of war. Well, that's the main thing that I take away from it, although I know that it was probably only a sub-theme. Anyway, it was a powerful one.Now, the not so positive things, the reasons this book only gets 3 stars. Let me start with Chapter 1. Interminable. Chapter 1 felt like it took forever. It might have been me, but I think it was Frank. Oh gosh, that was a long first chapter about a boring, boorish man. I might have got to appreciate him at the end, but certainly not in that first chapter. Thank God for Chapter 2.And that leads me to the second problem. Leon's story was riveting, Frank's was a fair bit less riveting. I spent half the book hoping that Leon's story would never end, the other hoping that Frank's story would. And that's not a great way for a novel to position itself.I feel terribly sad that I have only given such a beautifully written novel 3 stars.

It is written in a poetic, character driven narrative by an author who appears much wiser than her years.The story is a multi-generational dynamic of men in a family - men who have gone to war, are prone to violence and find it hard to use words to discuss their feelings. Instead of words they use alcohol, violence and avoidance.Leon's father is a baker in Australia who signs on to fight in the Korean War. When he returns he is not the same. His post-traumatic stress disorder creates constant fear and anger in him. He leaves his family and Leon's mother follows after him, leaving Leon alone to run the bakery when he is just nineteen. Leon is shortly thereafter conscripted into the Vietnam War where he sees atrocities and develops a propensity towards violence such that he is closed off from his wife and son, Frank.The novel alternates between two characters and stories 40 years apart - the story of Leon and that of his son Frank. As the novel begins, Frank has just been left by his girlfriend because of his aggression and violence. He goes to live in the country in a small bungalow that belonged to his grandfather, Leon's father. There he finds work and friendship though his life is fraught with fear - fear of what is lurking in the waters and in the cane fields. He is also afraid of the fear that constantly lurks in his heart. He drinks too much and feels the weight of his anxieties at every turn. As the novel opens we also learn about Leon, Frank's father, working in a bakery 40 years before with his father. The family is close and the art of baking is passed on lovingly from father to son until Leon's father goes to war and comes back isolated, frightened, and unable to connect with others.Leon, like his father before him, returns from war a lost soul. His wife dies young and he turns to drink. He finds it nearly impossible to raise his son Frank in any way that requires intimacy or rational planning. He is not even able to pack a lunch for Frank. One lunch pail contained a pair of sardines without an opener and a pair of socks.In the backdrop of Frank's narrative, there is a story of young girls disappearing from the area and being killed. This adds to Frank's fears as he has befriended a neighbor girl, Sal, who is seven years old. He fears for her.I found the early descriptions of Leon and his father working in their bakery to be beautifully wrought. Evie Wyld writes with a loving, perspicacious and brutal tongue. She is a writer to watch and I hope to read more of her work soon."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "Quite an ambitious debut novel for this Australian writer. I like her prose style and her ability to create a sense of atmosphere in the story. Remember that old saying about the sins of the fathers being visited upon the children? I think this story shows how the wounds of the fathers are passed down to the sons through the generations. The story is set in Australia. Chapters alternate between Frank and his father Leon, although the story covers three generations, including Leon's father as well. Frank's story takes place in current times. Dumped by his girlfriend and estranged from his father, he goes to live in an old shack near the sea that belonged to his grandfather. He battles his inability to \"get his life together\" and tries to make some sense of the long-term anger he has directed at his father. The father Leon's story is told from his long-ago boyhood up through his service in Vietnam and the mess his life became upon return from that war. Leon's parents were Dutch Jews and came to Australia when their own country became hostile to them in the 1930's during Hitler's rise to power. Leon's father was proud to serve his adopted country in the Korean War, but he came back utterly broken inside and unable to function in the world. This set Leon up to be essentially alone in the world as a teenager, hurt and lost and confused by his parents' behavior. When he is later conscripted and sent to Vietnam, he comes home broken inside just like his father and is unable to be a proper father to Frank. This is not a fast-paced grabber of a book, but Evie Wyld really captures how old hurts are carried down within a family. She does it quietly and steadily, without a lot of drama or flash. And it's also a nice way to learn a little more about life in Australia and the attitudes of the people there."}, {"userName": "Hugh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh", "userReview": "This is not an easy book to write about or a comfortable read, but it is an impressive debut novel.

The other part follows Frank's father Leon, first coming to terms with his own father's traumatic experiences of the Korean war and then as a conscript in Vietnam.

I envy Evie Wyld's clean, unvarnished style. Beautifully composed, with startling, vivid imagery in so many places. This book has bold ambitions, which I really liked it for. Parallel stories, separated by forty years, of a father and son - the father being younger than the son for much of the narrative. Each of the journeys is quite compelling, although Leon, the father's, story initially held me more. I really enjoyed the sections about his childhood in the cake shop when his own father left to go to the Korean war. And then when Leon, in turn, leaves the shop, conscripted to fight in Vietnam, there's a lovely symmetry to the experiences. Leon's son, Frank's, strand has more of a slow boil to it, although there are some nicely planted clues of what is ahead for him. His encounter with a shark is wonderfully portentous. Each strand reaches a climactic sequence that rewards the parallel structuring - but I'm not sure if the ending gave me everything that I had hoped for. I wouldn't have minded more of a big red bow to nicely tie everything up. There are deliberate loose ends and I sort of wish there weren't, really. However, that doesn't wreck an impressive debut.

Coming to it somewhat unprepared and as a book I probably would not have picked out for myself, I didn't have particular preconceptions/expectations, but what it turned out to be was a very well observed examination of families and men, social history and.. oh.. it was really quite sad throughout. Set in Australia, the book mainly follows a son and father, their distance and their closeness, and how they came to be the people they were. It struck a really witty balance between beautifully described and observed small delicate points, and a rambling, bumbling colloquial Aussie male slang - the two meshed and not jarring. It reminded me favourably of 'The Narrow Road to the Deep North' by Richard Flanagan, about which it shares several themes of loss and isolation. Though pretty miserable and unrelentingly worrying, I didn't mind this - I only feel it didn't merit a full five stars because at times the closely linked two main characters were difficult to distinguish and keep track of - possibly intended but certainly confusing on occasion."}, {"userName": "Chaitra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book. I don't know - I don't have the greatest track record with Australia-set books. I think they lose something for me, as Australian's probably the only English dialect that I have actual trouble with. But I loved this book's title. But it didn't translated over to the love of the book. I still liked it, the prose made sure of that (and was easy to handle to an Australia-ignorant like me), but I didn't love it.The problem is the father-son relationship as depicted in the book. That's the crux basically, alternating chapters of the father and the son, the Vietnam war veteran and the general fuck-up trying to make a life in a shack, in different time periods. I understood that they're both screwed up individuals. But what exactly happened between Leon and Frank that their relationship deteriorated to that extent? We know from Frank that Leon neither abused him sexually, nor hit him. Leon slept around, but I don't think we're given any evidence that he was unfaithful to Frank's mother. Leon was in a crazy war, but all the memories Frank has of Leon when his mother was still alive are good. So, what snapped? What was so horrible about this father of his that Frank would hit his girlfriend and then deteriorate enough for her to leave him for having met Leon and wanting to mend their relationship? It's just not there, the motivation for the hatred Frank carries around. It makes him very hard to understand. But he's half the book, and frankly I liked his chapters more than I did Leon's as Frank's story had more interesting characters. But it still bothers me that I wasn't following one character at all, and no amount of beautiful prose can stem that frustration. And the prose is beautiful. It evokes the place well. To a novice, Australia is fully present, so is Vietnam in part of Leon's chapters. She doesn't raise any new subjects, but what she does, she does so in a very forceful and authoritative voice. Her minor characters are quite good too - I loved Sal and her pet carrot and would have liked to see more of her. By contrast, the clarity that is missing with the central characters becomes even worse. Also, the ladies in the leading men's lives, the ones we're told are the main reasons why are men are what they are, remain in the shadows. They're hardly present, except as some background chatter, and that's a surprising thing to find in a woman author's work. And I'm not sure that's a brave thing to do - for me, it leaves the novel incomplete.From my whining in the previous paragraphs, you'd think I would have hated the book more. It's surprising, but the book gripped me when I was reading it. It's only after I snapped it shut was I dissatisfied. Evie Wyld knows how to tell a story, and it is an accomplishment for a book which deals with unlikable characters doing mostly unlikable everyday things, with not much drama, no reconciliation or catharsis. 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050107-jane", "userReview": "It must have been towards then end of last year that I first spotted After the Fire, a Still Small Voice, cover turned out on the new books shelf in the library.

A shallow person like myself, I can hardly wait to move on to something with a plot or at least a point."}, {"userName": "Saleh MoonWalker", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66648866-saleh-moonwalker", "userReview": "Onvan : After the Fire, a Still Small Voice - Nevisande : Evie Wyld - ISBN : 307378462 - ISBN13 : 9780307378460 - Dar 304 Safhe - Saal e Chap : 2009"}, {"userName": "Golden Amal", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48923692-golden-amal", "userReview": "The reading experience for me in a nutshell: That's not review actually describing the book, but what my initial thoughts were. 1. \"I really liked \"All the Birds, Singing\". Gritty, raw, a strong, female protagonist, not just a walking stereotype or cardboard cut-out. Jake felt real. Multi-layered, not one-dimensional. Something the characters lack in this novel: motivation, personality, an agenda. I'm not sure why I should root for any of them nor why I should be interested in their fate. That's not a likability-question, I just think the characters are badly, BADLY written. And I'm not sure which ones received the worst fate. The female characters, all of them in \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\"-territory, or the walking male stereotype (Only interested in physical activity, going to the loo and drinking beer celebrating bromance with their unappealing, not very interesting, barely mentioned and relatively irrelevant \"mates\") Frank or Bob. 2. I had the feeling the novel could've worked easily as a short-story. Why not focus on the \"family trauma\", the \"elephant in the room\", the PTSD-episodes nearly every character faces? Why extend on the war scenes? (And I understand her interest in the subjects of \"Australians in the Vietnam-War\" or \"Australians during the Korean War\", I really do. But she barely touched the surface of the \"Australian experience\"...) Why was the \"Sal\"-plot even relevant? 3. The pacing, oh, the pacing. The story took way too long to take of, it was quite hard to not lose interest and some scenes felt... irrelevant to pointless? (The desert-scene...) 4. The book wasn't bad. Some books are so badly written they feel like a car crash, you cannot look away, you have some fun tearing them apart. It's well-written for the most-part, and Evie Wyld proved herself to be a good writer to me with \"All the Birds, Singing\". It's not a bad, but disappointing read. Flat, very very flat. Like a pancake. Yes, \"After the Fire, a Still Small Voice\" feels like a very flat, not very fluffy pancake, barely edible, just enjoyable with lots and lots of fruits or maple syrup. Which you have to buy extra. After 8 o'clock in the evening, all the shops closed. (5. That's not something I hold against the author but whoever wrote the blurb to this book. Shame on you, sir/lady, shame on you!)"}, {"userName": "Catriona Troth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20343190-catriona-troth", "userReview": "I am not sure why I found this book a tricky one to read. Or perhaps not tricky \u2013 just slow. It is not a long book. Nor is the language used in anyway obscure or challenging. If anything it is stripped down to the bare bones, allowing the poetry of the words to shine through.The explanation may lie in something Amit Chaudhuri said on the wonderful BBC World Book Club. He described himself as someone with \u2018a short attention span\u2019 who was drawn to poetry because he got bored if he couldn\u2019t find something to interest him within the length of an individual sentence.After the Fire a Still Small Voice is a book that requires you to pay attention at that sort of level. And my brain responded by insisting that I should read it in small samples, with breaks in between.The plot such as it is, is gossamer fine and almost irrelevant. It concerns three generations of Australian men affected, directly or indirectly, by war. Two of them are point of view characters and the third we see only through the eyes of his son, Leon.Leon\u2019s father, a Dutch immigrant, is conscripted to fight in the Korean War, leaving his teenage son to look after the bakery business he has built up. When he comes back, he is no longer able to take up the reins of his life, something Leon finds hard to understand or forgive. But a few years later, Leon is sent to fight in Vietnam. Faced with the brutality of war, he too begins inexorably to change.The connection between these two and the novel\u2019s other narrator, Frank, only becomes apparent as the story unfolds. Frank has just moved to a remote cabin that once belonged to his grandparents, on the run from violence of his own temper. He tries to fit in to the small, Queensland community while keeping himself to himself. But his past is catching up with him.Evie Wyld is brilliant at conveying the laconic speech of these tough Australian males \u2013 even (as here) in the face of tragedy.\u201cThey found Ian\u2019s girl.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s all right?\u201d\u201cNup.\u201dHe drank again.\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cJawbone, up at Redcliff.\u201d\u201cFuck\u2019s sake.\u201dShe is also brilliant at distilling the landscape \u2013 the sheer size and emptiness that creates its own danger. \u201cHe had the feeling that he in the same patch of desert, that there was a cunningly hidden conveyor belt that he walked against, keeping him in the same spot.\u201dThe characters, like the landscape, are easier to admire than to love. You remain feeling a little wary of both. But most of all you feel the blighting effect of war, stretching down through the generations."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy", "userReview": "Frank has returned to his childhood playground, a beach cottage near Queensland, to sort out his life after a devastating breakup, a relationship that inevitably ended when he became physically violent with his girlfriend. He loathes what he did, and runs to hide in a place that he thinks will comfort him. Once there, memories begin to eat at him, becoming so real that he turns his head and alerts to their arrival.He can\u2019t relate to his new violent streak, and tries to analyze what has happened since his mother\u2019s death that turned him. Violence would have been more appropriate, more expected, from his father or even his grandfather, both veterans of brutal warfare in Asia. As the novel continues, the narration explores the experiences of both of those men in war and at home.It\u2019s oversimplified to say that war changed them, and Wyld doesn\u2019t take us down that well-worn path. Rather, what makes this story complex is how it changed everyone else. Wives and girlfriends alternate between comforters and enemies, their every action subject to the random and unpredictable moods of their men.\u201c Some fellas, they make the women lonely. Maybe it doesn\u2019t apply to you, mate, but maybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re here\u201dFrank sorts through his memories while being befriended by a small girl and her pet carrot. A missing teenager and a grieving couple complicate his life while his coworkers rail against the Aboriginal natives that reside in the community. All the while his memories and fears creep up on him though he tries to ignore them. At one point, he makes a conscious decision to rid himself of tangible items to remove the memories that go with them:\u201cMakes things easier having less stuff. See, if I keep them I\u2019ve got to find a place to put them in \u2013 probably in a box or something so they don\u2019t get broken\u2026And when you start to get older that sort of thing gets to be more of a problem.\u201dThis novel focuses on the intimate details of these men and their lives in a setting of urbanization and change. Wyld describes subtle gestures and inner thoughts flawlessly, and invents these entirely new flawed characters like none I\u2019ve read before. Her writing style reminds me of Tim Winton (my favorite author), with its focus on the Australian bush and seaside with their colors and plants and weather. An unexpected sweetness is found mixed in with the brutality of war. A really enjoyable story that makes me eager for her next book."}, {"userName": "Shivanee Ramlochan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2912529-shivanee-ramlochan", "userReview": "Excerpted from the full review:\"Frank Collard turns to the wild, and his grandparents\u2019 rustic outpost in the swamplands, when an abusively disastrous relationship shatters his heart. Lonely, he gradually inches away from being corralled by the teeming landscape that surrounds his shack, to becoming a part of it, blending gracelessly and gruffly into the local milieu. Though he adapts the semblance of a normal life, rooted in work and earnest, albeit thorny, social interaction, he shares little of the past he\u2019s fled. His reluctance to unburden himself of old hurts mirrors the journey of his father Leon, an extraordinary maker of cakes who found himself hard-pressed into military service, feeling it change him perhaps irreparably, as it did his own father, who volunteered eagerly, yet found vital parts of himself effaced by the reality of war.There is the distinct impression one sometimes receives, when reading of something grand, or sweeping, or otherwise elaborately contrived, that a character has just done in the book one\u2019s reading. The feeling is akin to furrowing the brow and exclaiming, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just not how real people behave, is it?\u201d It is worth noting right here that Evie Wyld\u2019s book is built on the structure of something unflinchingly honest \u2014 even the way it flinches is honest. While reading, one gains the impression of absorbing something stripped to barebones and left in the sun to roast, of prose subjected to a rigorous, flinty syntax, studded through with alarming pinpricks of raw beauty.\"You can continue reading my full review of 'After the Fire, A Still Small Voice' at Novel Niche! :)"}, {"userName": "Our Library Mornington", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4700983-our-library-mornington", "userReview": "If you enjoy literary Australian fiction, then give this one a try. It is an impressive debut novel from author, Evie Wyld, who tackles the subject of father and son relationships. This compelling story centres upon a rundown shack in the sugar cane regions of Eastern Australia. Frank, his father and his grandfather have each retreated separately to the shack at some point in their lives. The building has been a haven for the men from the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Now Frank has retreated from the outside world after a relationship breakdown. A local girl goes missing and Frank is a suspect. The tension mounts and the story flicks back and forth from Frank\u2019s trauma to that of his father over forty years earlier. I enjoyed the two parallel stories of Frank and his father.

Frank is deeply affected by the actions and experiences of his father, who in turn was marked by his father.

After the departure of the woman he loves, Frank drives out to a shack by the ocean that he had last visited as a teenager. There, among the sugarcane and sand dunes, he struggles to rebuild his life. Forty years earlier, Leon is growing up in Sydney, turning out treacle tarts at his parents' bakery and flirting with one of the local girls. But when he's drafted to serve in Vietnam, he finds himself suddenly confronting the same experiences that haunt his war-veteran father.
