The authors were themselves artists and maintain long friendships with other artists, as well as photo archives of the time, on display in this one-of-a-kind book. Early 70s New York saw the growth of a new phenomenon. Key pioneers tell their own story. Eye-opening first-hand story accounts in pictures and text. The names names here have star status far beyond graffiti culture; without them, no Seen, no Banksy, no Revok. In this glimpse of a different New York, there is an invaluable picture of graffiti in the early, playful years.
