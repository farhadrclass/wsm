Like many novels that I've picked up on the free bookshelf at the local general store, this one has turned out to be a diamond in the rough. Following Candido and seeing the intricate set up that the revolutionists have plotted out for him is amazing. Each time the reader is led to believe that he and his lover have finally gotten a break and might make headway in the chase, Otto, Stepa, or another nasty rear their evil head. Add to the mix that this little game of cat and mouse has been going on for at least a year (at this point in the novel they have a young daughter) and over the globe, it's enthralling to see what will happen next. 5/31/12 - I have to say, I'm very disappointed in the Hollywood-ized ending. While the rest of the novel was stellar, the ending will have you wanting to throw the book against the wall."}, {"userName": "Jamie Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31292552-jamie-robertson", "userReview": "I would recommend his novel Daddy to anyone, so I started this with great expectations. I wasn't disappointed, a cracking storyline blending in major historic figures. Sadly though, halfway through it became absolute drivel and continued to be drivel all the way to the end. I have never wanted a book to end so much."}, {"userName": "Harold", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1016399-harold", "userReview": "I really liked this one. It's simply a good spy/adventure story that is as easy to read as watching a good movie. I wanted something light after a few serious reads that took some concentration and this fit the bill nicely.Very satisfying."}, {"userName": "Meryan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8992462-meryan", "userReview": "It was a waste of reading time."}], "description": "An explosive thoroughly intriguing espionage thriller from the author of the international bestseller Daddy.
