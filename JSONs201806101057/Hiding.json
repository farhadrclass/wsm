Right from the first meeting you get a feeling Keller is looking for someone.Armed with a work permit for the UK.\u00a0We discover he is off to Scotland. We can only imagine it's to locate Rebecca!But why??As the book progresses it alternates between Rebecca and Keller's stories and how there lives are cleverly weaved together.The whole way through Jenny drags you into the characters lives. She dangles lil bits of juicy information then leaves you hanging. Which I loved! It kept me wanting to read more to find out just exactly what Keller is up too! The characters are an eclectic mix but fit together perfectly. Things are not always what they first appear to be! Be warned once you start this book you will be enthralled, as Jenny's writing drags you in and captures your attention. Prepare to enter a web of secrets!

This is the story of two characters Keller Baye and Rebecca Brown who live on different sides of the Atlantic to each other. We read their story in both the past and the present which I felt really added to the story. I don\u2019t want to say too much about the story as I believe you should just jump in blind. I found this to be a well thought out storyline. The twists and turns had me gripped.

The two threads of the story are each very good as separate stories and for the first half of the book I enjoyed reading each of them although despite knowing that they must intersect at some point it was not clear how and why this would happen. Rebecca is a bit of a dreamer who was far too young to remember much about how she and her siblings came to be staying with their grandparents in scary Taransay which stood in the wilds of Scotland and had bars on the windows. Brother Austen lives away at boarding school and sister Colette is educated at grammar school, leaving just Rebecca at the local state school. Grandfather Ralph and Rebecca are close and spend a lot of time together in his study while grandmother Primmy is controlling and doesn't allow Rebecca to go anywhere or do anything other than her school work.Meanwhile Keller's father Othaniel is executed by lethal injection in the USA, witnessed by Keller. On his father's incarceration Keller is sent to live with his aunt Joya who only puts a roof over his head in return for the payment the local authorities give her for doing so. She barely shows him any care, regularly locking him out of the house overnight and not providing food for him. Keller goes off the rails in spectacular fashion and this experience sets up the path of his future life.The two storylines pretty much collide when Keller tracks down Rebecca and travels to Scotland under a fake identity to find her. Becky has no idea who he is and falls for his charms with no idea the danger she is putting herself in. I was drawn well and truly into the story right from the start and was interested to find out what linked the two characters and why Keller would go to the trouble and expense of travelling to Scotland to find Becky. The author builds tension steadily along the way and the climax to the story was not what I expected at all. Personally I would have liked more of a back story to the older generation in the tale and I think this would have added a little more depth to the characters but other than that I found this a very enjoyable novel and will look out for further work by this author."}, {"userName": "Monnie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie", "userReview": "In the interests of full disclosure, it's not often that I accept an offer to read a book that comes directly from the author. For the most part, that's because I've been burned in the past, and I have zero confidence that anything in the pages has ever seen the eyes of a proofreader. And as a professional writer/editor (nonfiction only), finding more than handful of errors - even in a pre-publication copy - is enough to make me apoplectic. It is - and forever will be - my belief that anyone who doesn't have the rules of grammar and punctuation down pat has no right to call him- or herself a writer.That settled, something told me this one would be different (the fact that the author's email message to me was totally coherent went a long way toward convincing me of that, in fact; you wouldn't believe the grammatical awfulness of some of the requests I get).And guess what? I'm delighted to report that this book is a gem well worth reading. Ms. Potts, thank you for giving me a few hours of reading pleasure - truly, I didn't want the experience to end.The beginning happens in 2007 with the tragic death of Rebecca Brown's parents in an auto accident. At age 4, she and her older brother Austin and sister Colette were sent to live with their grandparents in northern Scotland. But their lives are mired in secrecy; the siblings are all but confined to a falling-apart home with little outside contact, under the thumbs of two people who are for the most part caring but refuse to allow questions about anything that happened in the past.In 2021 \"across the Pond,\" as we Americans like to say, is another family of sorts. Keller Baye, the son of a man convicted of a terrorist-type crime in North Carolina, watches as his imprisoned father is given a lethal injection (as an aside nitpick, I've been to the North Carolina Outer Banks something like 27 times and as far as I know there is no hotel on Bodie Island). By this time, Rebecca is a grown woman - albeit with understandable issues - and a relatively successful standup comedian, drawing heavily on her life experiences for material.From that point on, chapters flip from Keller's life to Rebecca's, with each adding details about how the two characters are connected. To be honest, this then-and-now is a technique with which I've grown quite weary, although I must say it's done quite well here - and upon more reflection, it's most likely the only way this complex story could have been told (all of which is my convoluted way of saying hey folks, it works). It is, of course, that connection that makes the story intriguing and hard to put down. As Keller leaves the United States for England with a new identity, it's clear he intends to find Rebecca (and slowly, his reason is revealed, heightening the thrill factor). Why, exactly, is Keller so intent on finding Rebecca? And what will happen if and when he does? Most of the loose ends are tied up by the final pages, although a few are left to readers' imaginations at the rather abrupt ending.So what's next? A sequel might be in order, or not. Whatever is in store, I'll be eager to read it. As for this one, well done!"}, {"userName": "Claire ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50509336-claire", "userReview": "I really liked the sound of this storyline, it appealed and sounding like one of those good old fashion thrillers although sadly it wasn't as gripping as I had first hoped. The idea was a good one, a sprinkle of the usual family secrets and a man with a hidden past and an ulterior motive. I was curious, I wanted to know what happened but yet the ending, for me, wasn't the expected one. Some of the aspects were good, strong and engaging whilst others felt long winded and irrelevant although I appreciate the back story was required to assist the reader in piecing together the puzzle. I did really like the book cover. I am not sure this would be a book I recommend, feeling slightly jerky with a broken flow but other readers have really enjoyed Hiding giving it higher ratings than I. Not everyone can enjoy the same story."}, {"userName": "Chandra Claypool (wherethereadergrows)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9722719-chandra-claypool-wherethereadergrows", "userReview": "Potts takes us on a journey through Rebecca and Keller's lives. Through intricate back stories, we learn of their families, their own pasts and how they end up intersecting. For me, the beginning was a bit slow in starting and wasn't quite grasping my interest. Keller's journey to becoming a killer was quite more interesting than Rebecca's back story. But once the story starts to mesh together, it takes off. The concept of this book is fantastic. While the writing felt choppy in certain areas, long winded in others, I think the fully fleshed out back stories were necessary to really get to the full circle towards the ending. For thriller lovers, the slow start may deter you. Power through. The ending will surprise you. I think there will be a bit of a divide in thriller lover's opinions on this one. But that's what happens when a unique voice enters the genre. I'm a bit torn. Love the concept and twists but it didn't quite grip me or keep me glued to the pages as I had hoped that it would. Certainly intrigued enough to want to see what else Potts brings our way.

The writing was one of the best parts of this book; it was very fluid, smooth and engaging. The next best thing for me was the mind-blowing plot; it was so interesting that it was hard for me to\u00a0stop myself from reading the next chapter every time I finished one. The plot unravels beautifully and the reveals were rewarding. Once I started the book, it was literally unputdownable! The chapters are paced brilliantly and the changing timelines of the two different POV characters made this a thoroughly enjoyable read.The characters were so good and full of life - I loved Rebecca, and though I wasn't able to overly connect to Keller, I did get the motivation behind his actions. The secondary characters were also well constructed and very relatable.This is my first book by this author and I'm looking forward to reading more by her in the near future.

His descent from neglected child into a murderer was chilling and rapid. Very much a loner but he also knew how to charm, until he had no further use for that person and he then turned to cruelty.\u2028Rebecca was also a loner. I liked her alternative name of Youngest or Youngest Brown. She was adamant that she would do her own thing, all the time giving an outward appearance of independence but inside she was suffering, determined to find answers about her past.\u2028There is a lot of cruelty, all from Keller. He was a character who I struggled to like or have any sympathy for. But as well as the cruelty there was also humour. I liked the way that Keller struggled to understand Scottish and English slang. Primmy was a character who made me smile a lot, the way that her dialect was described was something I have never seen before.\u2028The ending was the part of the novel that I found unexpected. Some have described it as abrupt but I felt that it suited the rest of the narrative perfectly. I\u2019m hoping for a sequel though."}, {"userName": "Leslie aka StoreyBook Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272944-leslie-aka-storeybook-reviews", "userReview": "This story is told from two perspectives \u2013 Rebecca and Keller. Rebecca and her siblings live with their grandparents and all they know is that their parents were killed in a car crash. Keller is the son of a man that was a getaway driver for a heist but ended up killing a judge. Keller lived with a very uncaring and cruel Aunt and I think this is part of the reason why he became much like his father, a killer.The story spans a little over a decade as it starts when Rebecca and Keller are younger. Then the story jumps forward to when they are in their early twenties. Keller in this time has watched his father die via the death penalty and has become quite sadistic. Rebecca always wonders what happened to her parents and thought she might have been adopted and wonders who her biological mother might be and if she was still alive. All of this is based on her grandfather\u2019s dying words to her.While reading the book, it took a long time for the connection between Rebecca and Keller to emerge, over fifty percent. The story still builds from there and the last 10% of the book is probably the best because that is when everything is coming to a head.As a disclosure, there are several descriptive sex scenes and quite a few f* bombs in case that is the sort of thing you don\u2019t like to read."}, {"userName": "Donna Maguire", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7997643-donna-maguire", "userReview": "https://donnasbookblog.wordpress.com/...I love this cover, it fits the book so well, it's really striking and definitely drew me in!It is a well written psychological thriller that has a great storyline to it.

Othaniel Baye is to be executed for his crime. A murderer, the father of Kellar Baye. Keller being a man you will pity, you will get to know him better: him and all his motives. A man stuck in a sorry situation trying to make it all better for himself. A hard worker, they all say. Will he capture your heart? Like he did, Rebecca Brown's. Rebecca lost her parents young, and was left with no real answers. She's trying to move on from all that but still wanting to know of her family. This book is your classic British thriller (thankfully without all the detectives), except everything seems so shockingly real. It was unpredictable but it seemed as if you were quite expecting the ending yet it still managed to surprise. For that, all credit goes to Jenny Morton Potts- she delivered a wacky story that breaks all the rules. For one thing, for a thriller, this book had a lot of understated humour. Comedy gold: the antics of Rebecca Brown and her family. But the greatest rule broken was that ending! The end to all that bubbling anticipation, this book indeed delivered. Potts writes so imaginatively, placing revelations all through book when you'd least expect them. But more than that, it was how the reader knew something before even the characters, it seems the reader, like the writer knows what is coming, yet... We are still pleasantly surprised. It's a book fit to capture your attention!I received this book from the author for review consideration."}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30404765-yvonne", "userReview": "Set as a sort of time slip and as a transatlantic thriller we meet Keller Baye from America and Rebecca Brown from Scotland. There is a connection that links these two people, well, more their parents actually, but not everyone knows what this link is. As the story unfolds we are taken deeper into the two family\u2019s histories and are given details on Keller and Rebecca, their upbringing within their families, education and friends.The story starts off at an unhurried stroll and gradually picks up pace as this reader got more engrossed in it. There are several threads have been woven and are gradually twisted and brought together. Jenny has done a brilliant job of giving little snippets and morsels of information and elusive details about the characters at just the right moments, giving hints at what is to come. A little about the plot, and it will be a little as I really do not want to give anything away. An incident occurs, it is very much a wrong place wrong time moment, but the resulting consequences have far-reaching implications, and that is all I am prepared to say, I just don\u2019t want to hint at anything and spoil it for another reader. Just grab yourself a copy and read it, you won\u2019t be disappointed.As for the characters, they are a wonderful varied mixed bunch that have a whole host of traits that seem to fit really well, you will meet good, bad, ugly, funny, sly, strict and lovable rogue types. Some you will like, others you will not and I also like the ones that make me change my mind on how I feel about them. A great look at the differences within the family dynamics as well, how they interact with each other, or don\u2019t in some cases. The descriptions of the sandstone house that is Taransay I loved, a bleak, grim, cold draughty mansion and the isolation of it gave me a real image as I read.So in case you had not realised, I really loved this book, I liked the way it grabbed my attention from the very beginning and did not let me go until the very last words. I wasn\u2019t sure of where this book was going to take me, but as it had piqued my interest early on I was quite willing to be led and greedily kept turning the pages.This is a book that is ideal for those who like a slow burner that then starts to increase in pace as the story evolves and then has you racing to the end. A brilliant read, with well-developed characters, a great pace, very good setting descriptions and plot lines. A definite must read recommendation from this reader to others who like a good thriller.Now I have to mention the cover, it is intriguing and after you have read the book, take another look at it !

It\u2019s a bleak seemingly loveless household according to the narrative from Rebecca\u2019s point of view. But there are many unanswered questions, especially about the death of here parents; killed in a car accident. And Keller Baye, the antagonist; an American youth, and son of a murderer. His narrative is revealed slowly and is, initially, more difficult to grasp. But what is obvious is the lack of love in his upbringing, and explains his total absence of empathy for anyone in his world. (I use the word \u2018world\u2019 on purpose, rather than his \u2018life\u2019; right from the start his character is portrayed as distanced from any other character in the story \u2013 he seemed to me to be more of a spectator). The most unsettling is his graphic, almost internal narration of his presence at his father\u2019s execution.Told alternately from each of the two main characters\u2019 point of view, the plot lines are related both in the present and in flashbacks, (a device I like as a reader; to me this always adds so many more layers). But it wasn\u2019t only these two characters that came alive for me; most of the minor characters are many layered as well; some I liked, some I didn\u2019t \u2013 which, is, undoubtedly, as the author intendedAnd both the internal and spoken dialogue expands on all the characters and there is never any doubt who is speaking. The descriptions of the settings give a great sense of place; it\u2019s easy to envisage each scene. From the descriptions of the isolated chilly mansion in Highlands of Scotland to the cramped unloving house that was Keller Baye\u2019s home with his aunt in the USA, to the external scenes when each character is telling their own narrative and on to the scenes where they are eventually together.As I said earlier it\u2019s a great plot; seemingly separate tales with no connection, both well told, until a sudden realisation that there is an inevitable link. Initially there is an even pace to the two separate narratives but then the suspense builds up as threads of the parallel stories intertwine and connect.A gripping read.And right up to the last chapter I would have given Hiding five stars. So many small twists and turns, so many suspenseful moments joining up all the past narrative. But then, for me, it ended too abruptly. I won\u2019t say how, and no doubt other readers will have their own opinions. But the gradual deepening of the plot and the lead up towards the end worked so well \u2013 and then\u2026it was over; a sudden and unsatisfying denouement. A last point; I love the cover; the silhouette of the woman looking outwards as though searching, the grim image of the man\u2019s face as though watching; the contrast of light and dark. Wonderful!Despite my reservations of the ending (and I leave that point for other readers to decide), I would certainly recommend Hiding. Jenny Morton Potts has a great style of writing."}, {"userName": "Grady", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1362506-grady", "userReview": "\u2018If you\u2019ll forgive me, memory lane is not where I need to be this minute.\u2019British author/screenwriter Jenny Morton Potts lives and writes in Derbyshire. She has published two books \u2013 PIANO FROM A 4TH STORY WINDOW and the screenplay resulted in a movie filmed in Sussex, and now HIDING. Jenny\u2019s gift for creating terrifying atmospheres and leading the reader through twists and turns that border on incredible is evident from the start of her book \u2013first we meet Rebecca - \u2018Killer Road,April 2007 - They died, Rebecca Brown\u2019s mum and dad. They were killed on a road with a big reputation. Rebecca could only imagine it. She was hundreds of miles from the scene of the crash when it happened. When she thought of that road, she pictured it covered in ice, black ice, since the accident took place on a bitter December night. The A42 was the road\u2019s alphanumeric name. The Killer Road, they called it back then in the papers. The Killer Road has struck again! The headlines came into Rebecca\u2019s mind like a voice, like Vincent Price, as if the road arched up into vertical life, a tarmac monster stalking its victims. Rebecca Brown was four years old when she became an orphan, alongside her sister, Colette, and her brother, Austen. Rebecca was the youngest. She couldn\u2019t even remember the moment she was told. What had they said? \u2018Mummy and Daddy have had a terrible accident, dear. In the car.\u2019 At the time, she knew little more than the fact. They were gone. They\u2019d been there all the days of her life, and then they were not. Of the circumstances and detail, she knew next to nothing. Perhaps Rebecca hadn\u2019t thought to ask questions. Perhaps there was little more to say to a child so young. As Rebecca grew, though, so did her thirst for knowledge. But it seemed that, even if there had been a window of opportunity to make her enquiries, that window got bricked up years ago. There was a solid wall now between Rebecca Brown and the truth.\u2018Then we meet Keller \u2013 \u2018Death Row, June 2021 - Keller Baye made sure to find the shade of a tree when he drove into the parking lot of Ashvale Mall. The weesatch branches hung over the hood of his Chevy Silverado, leaves just inches from the windshield. In a light wind, those leaves would reach down and stroke the glass. But there was no wind on this late June day in 2021 and the sun was already relentless in the North Carolina sky. Keller watched a bug dance across the dashboard, looking for an exit. Was this a good day to die? Keller thought that it was as good as any. The Chevy pick-up was his pride and joy. He worked three jobs to keep up the payments. But he wouldn\u2019t be making a payment next month, or ever again. Keller Baye had lived his whole life in this State. It never occurred to him to look elsewhere but now everything had changed. He\u2019d been on this earth for twenty five years but he felt he was only just starting to really come alive. Up till now, he\u2019d never been further than Charlotte, which is where he was headed right after his meeting with the bounty hunter, day after tomorrow. Of course, Mr. Blonk did not like to be called a bounty hunter, preferring instead the term skip tracer. But essentially, Blonk hunted folk down for money. And since Keller was paying, he\u2019d call the guy whatever the hell he chose.\u2019These two dissociative time frames and people cross paths into creating a psychological thriller that is one of the strongest before the public. The plot outline offers a whisper of how the story plays \u2013 \u2018Keller Baye and Rebecca Brown live on different sides of the Atlantic. Until she falls in love with him, Rebecca knows nothing of Keller. But he\u2019s known about her for a very long time, and now he wants to destroy her. This is the story of two families. One living under the threat of execution in North Carolina. The other caught up in a dark mystery in the Scottish Highlands. The families\u2019 paths are destined to cross. But why? And can anything save them when that happens?\u2019Very strong writing by Jenny \u2013 a book that pleads to be another screenplay!"}, {"userName": "Phil Leader", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28233323-phil-leader", "userReview": "Keller Baye is the son of a murderer, a man he is about to watch die for his crime. A man who only wants one thing from his son: revenge.Rebecca Brown is an orphan who has been brought up by relatives in a remote Scottish house and who's thirst for knowledge about her parents and the car crash in which they died only grows keener the less those around her are prepared to talk about it.Despite the miles between these two people they are connected by a single thread, and that thread is set to bring them together and reveal the truth.Roughly the first part of the book tells the backgrounds of the two main characters, gradually revealing one event at a time exactly who Baye and Brown are, what drives them and how the loss of their parents has had an indelible effect on both their lives. The second half relates the events that unfold once fate has driven them together.Both characters feel very real, especially because of the care that has clearly gone into each of their back stories. Baye in particular could have just been a mere cipher of a child who went off the rails after his father went to prison. But that one event alone conspires with many others to shape Baye into the urgent tool of his father's revenge that he decides to be.The stories of the character's very different childhoods is engrossing, effectively told a series of anecdotes. Baye delivering justice for his cat. Brown burning the playing cards. All these seem very real because they could really happen.When the tension starts to build in the second half of the book it's not like a spring winding up; it is more like a boiler that is getting hotter and hotter and the pressure is rising all the time. It's not clear when something is going to break but it's clear that something will go very wrong at some point.This is a superb thriller with an excellent plot, some very good twists and written at a perfect pace, fast enough to keep the momentum up but slow enough to ratchet the tension up at the end of each chapter.

As Rebecca gets older she wants to know what happened to her parents but her family won't talk about it. Why? What are they hiding?Fast forward to the not too distant future of 2021 and Keller Baye is heading to the prison to watch his father be put to death by lethal injection. Keller is already severely damaged as his time spent living with his cruel Aunt Joya has made him into the man he is today. The event that started all this was the moment his father shot a man in a failed bank robbery and now Keller is out for revenge.The development of both main characters in Hiding is exceptional. I felt like I could see inside their heads and know what they were thinking and how they were feeling. I actually felt so sorry for both of them as they seemed so unhappy with their lives that they invent a new persona to escape who they really are. Rebecca reinvents herself as a comedian after a life spent feeling as if she didn't belong, her family has even taken her name away as they refer to her as 'Youngest Brown'. It might seem affectionate to them but I felt like it stole her identity. Meanwhile, Keller becomes quite the charmer with the ladies but he is not as controlled as Rebecca as his emotions can change at the flick of a switch.I was wondering what the link was between Rebecca and Keller from the start and after some nicely built suspense, the pieces all start falling into place. The title of the book is woven so cleverly into the story, meaning very different things for Rebecca and Keller, but ultimately every character is Hiding something. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Hiding; it is so intriguing and compelling that I lost track of time while I was reading (I could have easily read it in one sitting if I'd picked it up on a weekend rather than a work night). Reading Hiding is like doing a jigsaw; you have all of the pieces but you can't see the full picture until the final piece is slotted into place. Hiding is an exceptional book that hooked me from the start and kept me riveted throughout; a well-deserved five stars.I chose to read an ARC and this is my honest and unbiased opinion."}, {"userName": "Lynda Dickson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7863634-lynda-dickson", "userReview": "When she was four, Rebecca was orphaned - along with her older brother Austen and sister Charlotte \u2013 and sent to live with her grandparents in Scotland.

I had no idea what to expect when I began reading this, the synopsis not giving an awful lot away and the author being new to me. I couldn't have prepared myself though for the intense roller coaster of a ride it was going to take me on though - not a chance.\u00a0The book begins with ten year old Rebecca, the youngest of three siblings and being brought up by clearly reluctant grandparents following the death of her parents in a car crash years ago. It's very clear early on that something strange is going on in the sinister old house in remote Scotland, and that the set up with the siblings and their Grandparents not altogether a happy one, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was other than a creeping sense of unease.\u00a0Then the following chapter switches to a few years into the future - this time to the USA where we join Keller Baye as he prepares to witness his father's execution after years on death row. I'm not going to lie, I had absolutely no idea how the two situations where connected and became a little confused. It was such a sharp change of setting and narrative - but incredibly intriguing. I needed to know what the hell was going on!\u00a0And the author keeps the reader guessing right the way through the book, as it flips between Rebecca's life in Scotland and Keller's life in the USA. With snatches of a traumatic and unhappy childhood and some seriously disturbing scenes, as we learn slowly about Keller's past and what connects him to the family in Scotland. It's pretty gory at times - my stomach churning more than once, and a little bit violent. This is a gritty read, but while I found it a bit confusing to begin with, by around 25% of the way through I found myself absolutely gripped.\u00a0\u00a0The pace of this book is fast! The author constantly throws twists and shocks at the reader, keeping me on my toes right until the very end. I also thought she wrote the character of Keller incredibly convincingly, meaning that he was terrifyingly sinister and unpredictable throughout.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't all that sure I was going to enjoy this book when I started - finding the two stories confusing and a little complicated. But man, am I glad I stuck with it. Once it falls into place, this book is unputdownable. Even the ending left me wanting more.

The characters are interesting and well described, with exceptional dialogue. There\u2019s no \u201cone dialogue fits all\u201d here; each character talks uniquely: the three children, the grandparents, the teacher, the \u201cUncle\u201d, even the characters on the other side of the Atlantic. It\u2019s an intriguing plot, or should I say plots? Because in Hiding there are two apparently unconnected plots running in parallel for most of the book. Two locations. Two continents. Two timeframes. Two storylines. Two sets of characters. At times it was like reading two books.

The facts are presented to the reader, but the implications of these are not so that when the revelations to start, the surprised at of the best kind: the answers had been staring in the reader on the page from the very beginning.The story follows the lives of two main characters: the American Keller Baye, who went to attend the execution of his father and Rebecca Brown, who is growing up on a stern, bleak House in the Scottish Highlands with her grandparents. Rebecca and her siblings are orphans: their parent were mysteriously killed in a car pile-up, but no one talks to the children about it. The Scottish mansion is a something of a gothic trope full of of deep, dark and hidden secrets and as a child, Rebecca's narration of events, if not unreliable, may well be limited. Each character has flashbacks to the past as the mystery to the link that bonds them is slowly received. Keller left behind his life to stalk Rebecca, though the motives for this are slow in the telling. Meanwhile what we learn of Keller's past proves to be more and more horrific.This novel does remind us on passing that it is becoming more and more difficult to truly hide with the advent of the internet - sobering it is to be be reminded of this. It also reminds us how buried secrets and old wrongs may warp the psyches of those who are left behind, to say nothing of abuse and neglect. The pace of the tale is fairly slow but the suspense also effectively built up for a highly gripping read. Hiding is a subtle and atmospheric psychological novel as well as being full of twists and turns that keep going until the last page."}, {"userName": "Nora", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67350563-nora", "userReview": "I\u2019ve become a big fan of psychological thrillers over the last 12 months and am totally drawn into the complex human mind and how circumstances shape behaviours. Hiding by Jenny Morton Potts is of this genre. A very well written novel with twists and turns that when unravelled will leave you wide eyed and feeling slightly breathless. Have you ever wondered how your actions, how a moment in time can irrevocably and irreversibly change your whole being. How it can change the future of your loved ones. Whether your decisions are right or wrong? Rebecca Brown and her siblings were orphaned at a young age and have been brought up by their grandparents. Keller Baye is a loner who hasn\u2019t had the best of upbringings. The story weaves a descriptive background and goes back and forth through the timelines of their lives. The story starts of slow and meandering but I think it\u2019s essential to the plot. I grew to understand and even love some of the characters even through their confusion with their own feelings. It knits together and results in an unlikely love story with devastating consequences. This is the first novel I\u2019ve read from this talented author and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last.

I haven\u2019t read anything like that in a long time, if ever. For once it seemed like the characters were anything but the stock, ordinary typical hero/heroine, but instead all had personal demons, tragic histories, family secrets, and I thought the whole time/location shifting narratives angle was pretty cool too, even if at first I was a little lost. As I was reading it was really easy to imagine myself in the story with these characters and it was creepy and dark and disturbing (in a good way) and fun!! There are some things that happen that you REALLY don\u2019t expect to happen to a main character, and I wasn\u2019t sure how everything would come together in the end\u2026 I have some mixed feelings on it, but I think it works. Several interweaving plotlines are always at play here, and I was wondering how the author would wrap it all up, but in the end it all came together to create a fresh-feeling novel that was out of the ordinary and kept me totally hooked throughout. This is a great addition to the genre and if Ms. Potts writes any more like this, I\u2019ll be reading it!"}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9737686-jenna", "userReview": "4.5 stars\"Hiding\u201d wouldn\u2019t be my normal type of read (I\u2019m more of a fantasy and romance gal) but I\u2019ve been wanting to read more out of my comfort zone lately and expand my tastes\u2026 the premise and sample looked pretty cool (and has some great reviews!) so I thought I\u2019d give it a chance. I\u2019d so glad I did! It was far more exciting than I would\u2019ve guessed, and I found myself flipping the pages as fast as I could to see what would happen. I was totally wrapped up in the drama and liked the scenes with Rebecca and Keller once they meet (crazy!!!) and Austen and Collette, even Jane Rourke and the others\u2026. I really felt like I was part of the whole experience, from the very beginning. There were some really shocking twists that you *definitely* don\u2019t expect with the characters, and I liked how everything came full circle at the end, it was weirdly bittersweet and leaves you wanting more. This was a quick read with lots of great character development and surprising twists and turns, but also the writing itself was quite lovely \u2013 very descriptive and atmospheric (and very clean editing for the most part).

Rebecca, even as a bit of a lonely child, seems so relatable and the relationship that develops with her grandfather is honest and sweet. I found the Keller storyline less easy to settle into, but I did really enjoy his much darker concurrent story of childhood development. I suppose that mostly, especially later, a lot hinges on the power and sway that Keller is meant to have on people and at times it jars with the rest of the writing which seems so plausible. There is also an almost palpable moment that the action suddenly ramps up, then a lot of things are thrown at us as readers, a few odd decisions are made and finally the book abruptly ends. It's an odd choice to change the pacing quite so intensely, it really didn't sit too well with me. We lose important characters almost like footnotes just to get to Keller's finale, it all feels rushed. This is still a great book though, I've levied the same criticism at Stephen King- thriller endings are just a hard trick to pull off sometimes.
