But he tells it to us from a new perspective that makes you want to renew your efforts to apply these good principles. The best part is the beginning of the book where it goes over each of the 7 principles. A lot of the rest of the book is just filler where he repeats himself a lot to make a whole book out of pretty simple concepts. There are some great stories in his examples though. I loved the story about the Civil War victory. On the other hand, I didn't care for his example of using PT Barnum as a great success story for making a living turning humans into zoo specimens. However, I think the principles are very wise, especially the buck stops here and finding wise councilors. It's so refreshing to hear someone that doesn't buy the common theme heard today that \"all wisdom comes from within\" which is baloney. What a wonderful opportunity we have today to gain wisdom from the collective experience of so many generations before us!"}, {"userName": "Fraser", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51215777-fraser", "userReview": "Recaps the 7 principles nice and clearly.

In fact, this became a \"MUST OWN THIS\"! for me and I gave them as gifts at Christmas to everyone in my family. Very inspiring!Just listened to this a second time in twice as many years. I'm thinking a once-a-month, or perhaps once a quarter and certainly at least once a year would be a good prescription for me. He includes affirmations with each category.The Responsible DecisionThe Guided (informed) DecisionThe Active Decisionand so forth...post script -- I posted this review Nov. 2009 and just re-listened to in June 2015. My how time does fly. And yes, I need to now get my hands on the book and do the suggested writing exercises."}, {"userName": "Leslie Shreve", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56383748-leslie-shreve", "userReview": "\"Mastering the Seven Decisions\" is one of my favorite kinds of books to read. It focuses on success, happiness and fulfillment and it 19s never a bad idea to regularly read and reinforce positive messages and powerful concepts like the ones found in this book. Andy Andrews has read between 200 and 300 biographies and has spent more than 25 years reading, studying, and researching happy, successful and influential people. Out of his research he has written several books and this one gives readers the seven most important decisions that a person can make every day to become and stay happy, successful and fulfilled in their lives. He includes exercises you can do to check where you are today and steps you can take to make improvements. I highly recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Anne Marie Gazzolo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3066514-anne-marie-gazzolo", "userReview": "Another awesome book, loaded with inspiration, motivation and practical advice to achieve your dreams! Highly recommended for anyone and everyone who wants to succeed in doing what God made them to do. You do not need to read The Traveler's Gift first to benefit from the wealth in this book. I loved that book too. Mastering gives you all the nitty gritty details to how to really make the Decisions active and powerful in your life.

I would like seeing some high school and college freshman use this alongside a mentoring situation as a way to help them process life goals, education goals, and things that might be hindering you, blocking you from a fuller life. But again, I think a mentoring situation would be great. Some of the exercises were kind of incomplete, leaving you hanging, and needed to go one step further (hence working alongside a mentor)."}, {"userName": "Grant Davis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5952397-grant-davis", "userReview": "Just read this for college, I tried to \"eat the cherries and spit out the pits\" with this book, but his teachings become strictly heretical in places and his teaching is all too \"ME\"-based.I advise Christians to steer clear of this book\"Popular\" or \"famous\" does not mean TRUTH...one can gain the whole world, yet lose their soul"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Olson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3354306-elizabeth-olson", "userReview": "Good advice based on sound principles (mind the company you keep, find mentors on the way, etc.), paired with exciting stories to illustrate how each decision made a difference for someone important or famous.
