It starts in 1864 when Constance and Sophia are 16 and 15 respectively and follows them to the end of their lives. Book 1 covers their teenage years together above and in a draper\u2019s shop in a small town in the Staffordshire Potteries (central England). Book 2 is in the same location, but focuses on Constance. Book 3 is set in Paris during great political upheaval and war, and is about Sophia. In book 4, the two threads come together again. Bennett modelled it on the great realistic French novels of the time (Balzac, Flaubert et al); in some ways it is very mundane, and yet the attention to detail is extraordinary and compelling. As an elderly Sophia muses, \u201cMy life has been so queer \u2013 and yet every part of it separately seemed ordinary enough.\u201dIt opens with a description of the bucolic countryside, observing \u201cBut though Constance and Sophia were in it they were not of it\u201d because \u201cno person who lives in the district\u2026 ever thinks about the county\u201d, even though it\u2019s so much pleasanter than the busy, dirty town. They are the only children of a bedridden but successful and respected draper whose hatred of \u201cpuffing\u201d meant he refused to replace the fallen shop sign lest he \u201ccondone, yea, to participate in, the modern craze for unscrupulous self-advertisement\u201d. The draper\u2019s shop and home is their world, and yet their lives end up taking very different paths. Sometimes the contrasts are more parallel than they first seem, and I think this is an aspect that bears further thought and eventual rereading. Constance spends her whole life in the town, living a traditional life as dutiful daughter, wife, mother and widow, whereas Sophia spends many years in France, surviving the Siege of Paris and building independent success. Their lives seem so different, and for Sophia, there is an aspect of missing England when she\u2019s in France and vice versa. However, despite the apparent exoticism of her life, she comes to realise that her \u201clife, in its way, had been as narrow as Constance\u2019s. Though her experience of humanity was wide\u2026 she had been utterly absorbed in doing one single thing.\u201dI think the only weak point was some aspects of the ending, but in such a long and wonderful book, it's only a minor issue.SISTERHOODThe sisters are deliberately treated equally: their workboxes \u201cwere different but one was not more magnificent than the other. Indeed, a rigid equality was the rule\u201d and yet \u201cin some subtle way, Constance had a standing with her parents which was more confidential than Sofia\u2019s\u201d. This is clear when Mrs Baines confides in Constance about her problems with Sophia: \u201cher tone was peculiar, charged with import, confidential, and therefore very flattering to Constance.\u201dThey are close, though they have very different temperaments, with Sophia being the more mischievous and \u201ca prey ripe for the evil one\u201d. She is clever, proud, shrewd with money, independent and obstinate; she would rather suffer than beg or ask for forgiveness. Constance is\u2026 suited to her name, like the continuity and familiarity in her life. She is more dutiful and happy to assume she will go into the shop, but Sophia \u201chad always hated the shop. She did not understand how her mother and Constance could bring themselves to be deferential and flattering to every customer that entered\u201d.Their teenage banter, mild naughtiness (trying on mother\u2019s new dress) and sneering at a servant from afar could easily be transplanted to teenage sisters anywhere or when. Curiously, their adult relationship seems more like something from a historical novel than their childhood one. IS BLINDNESS THE PRICE OF LOVE?A recurring theme is the wilful blindness of love, be that of a parent, spouse or even another relative. All the main characters suffer for it in different ways, though one finally acknowledges the truth to herself, if not to others, and \u201cher affection was unimpaired\u201d. Can a child of less than five be bad? Is it \u201chidden sullenness or mere callous indifference, or a perfect unconsciousness of sin?\u201d And is it misguided to say \u201cIf we can be happy only when I give way to him, I must give way to him\u201d? However, that is hard to maintain: \u201cShe lived for nothing but to please him; he was, however, exceedingly difficult to please, not in the least because he was hypocritical and exacting, but because he was indifferent\u2026 whereas he was the whole of her universe, she was merely a dim figure in the background of his.\u201dMODERNITY AND FEMININE INSIGHT?The book has a curiously modern feeling in some ways. In particular, Sophia\u2019s teenage rebellion doesn\u2019t feel like something from a Victorian novel (though this was written in Edwardian times), either in terms of what she says, or what she does. When defiant, she is sullen and evasive, exhibits a \u201cdiffident boldness\u201d, plays the fairness card (\u201cOh, of course Constance is always right\u201d), answers back with excessive logic (\u201cYou tell me not to answer back, and then you say you\u2019re waiting\u201d) and declares \u201cYou all want to make me miserable\u2026 Put me in prison if you like! I know you\u2019d be glad if I was dead!\u201d. One confrontation ends when, \u201cwith a brusque precipitation of herself, vanished upstairs\u201d. I\u2019m sure most modern readers have been involved in such conversations. Although written by a man, all the main characters are women, but they are convincingly and insightfully rendered. For example, Constance\u2019s feelings after her honeymoon are delicately but touchingly described: \u201cShe sat there full of new knowledge and new importance, brimming with experience and strange, unexpected aspirations, purposes, yes - and cunnings!...You could see the timid thing [old, virginal Constance] peeping wistfully out of the eyes of the married woman.\u201d And the all-encompassing love of a new mother for her baby, she \u201cdived into the recesses of the perambulator and extricated from its cocoon the centre of the universe, and scrutinised him with quiet passion.\u201d The awkwardness of breastfeeding in front of others, and the stresses of controlled crying (not that it\u2019s called that) are also discussed. At a more trivial level, problems with builders promises, timescales and workmanship are timeless, and the etiquette of all-you-can-eat fare troubled even Edwardians, apparently: the delicate dilemma of \u201cfixed price per day for as much as they can consume while observing the rules of the game\u2026 in an instant decided how much they could decently take, and to what extent they could practise the theoretical liberty of choice\u2026 they had the right to seize all that was present under their noses, like genteel tigers; and they had the right to refuse; that was all.\u201d(In contrast, it is very Victorian in the way that women can be laid low by severe shock or a bit of a chill.)SYMPATHYIn the Preface, Bennett says \u201cit is an absolute rule that the principal characters of a novel must not be unsympathetic\u201d. I don\u2019t necessarily agree, but he stuck to his principle in this, and the others of his that I have read, which is not to say that his characters are flat or saccharine. And he has no such qualms where some of the minor male characters are concerned. MISCELLANEOUS QUOTES\u2022\t\u201cIt is to be remembered that in those days Providence was still busying himself [yes, him] with everybody\u2019s affairs.\u201d\u2022\tThe wakes (regional festival) were \u201can orgiastic carnival, gross in all its manifestations of joy. The whole centre of the town was given over to the furious pleasures of the people\u2026 displaying all the delights of the horrible.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cShe was athirst for sympathy in the task of scorning everything local.\u201d\u2022\tTypical Bennett: \u201cOne of Maggie\u2019s deepest instincts, always held in check by the dominance of Mrs Baines, was to leave pails prominent on the main routes of the house: and now, divining what was at hand, it flamed into insurrection.\u201d\u2022\tDr Harrop was \u201ccommon sense in breeches\u201d.\u2022\tWhen Mr Scales mentioned his fox-terrier bitch, he \u201chad no suspicion that he was transgressing a convention by virtue of which dogs have no sex\u201d (and I wonder if any Edwardian readers would have balked at Bennett\u2019s use of the word \u201csex\u201d).\u2022\tBe careful what may be overheard by servants, \u201cA clumsy question might enlighten a member of the class which ought ever be enlightened about one\u2019s private affairs\u201d.\u2022\t\u201cThe era of good old-fashioned Christmases, so agreeably picturesque for the poor, was not yet at an end.\u201d\u2022\t \u201cThe remarkable notion that twelve thousand pounds represents the infinity of wealth, that this sum possessed special magical properties which rendered it insensible to the process of subtraction.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cGood clothes, when put to the test, survive a change in fortune, as a Roman arch survives the luxury of departed empire.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cThe irrational obstinacy of a physically weak man who sticks to it that he can defy the laws of nature.\u201d\u2022\tBennett loves writing about hotels, and says \u201ccritically examining newcomers was one of the amusements of the occupants of the lounge.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cThe patched and senile drabness of the [hotel] bedroom.\u201d\u2022\tYou can tell respectable hotel guests because \u201ctheir clothes\u2026 did not flatter the lust of the eye\u201d.\u2022\t\u201cThe respectability of a luxury private hotel makes proper every act that passes within its walls.\u201dMODERN BRITISH ASIAN RETELLING!Hugely disappointing, and I suggest avoiding it.

And the fact that the change from the young girl to the stout ageing woman is made up of an infinite number of infinitesimal changes, each unperceived by her, only intensifies the pathos. It was at (the) instant (of this observation) that I was visited by the idea of writing the book which ultimately became The Old Wives' Tale.\" So writes Arnold Bennett in the preface to his masterpiece of realistic fiction, a book that follows the lives of two sisters, Constance and Sophia, from simple days in mid-Victorian England through the chaos and tumult of the modern age. Along the way, a novel is built, detail by rich detail, that rivals the great realistic works of Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, and Maupassant.I don't really know what I feel after the reading this book, apart from exhausted and sad. But digging deeper into the reason behind my feelings, I can only conclude that the realities of the two sisters were nothing really different than what is happening to everyone in life. \u201cScars are just another kind of memory.\u201d \u2015 M.L. Stedman, The Light Between OceansInstead of hiding behind social etiquette and good manners, the story, published in 1908, is told with blatant honesty, coupled with a subtle dry sense of humor and a profound knowledge of humanity. The historical aspects of events which were either unknown or peculiar, added a deeper nuance to the book. I really enjoyed it.I found a great audiobook version on Youtube and decided to finish the story that way since I probably would have put it down. It was really too slow and too boring. But the deeper I progressed into the narrative, the more I began to enjoy this saga about two sisters who made different choices in their lives and had to do the best they could. They took responsibility with the tools available to them: pride, a sense of honor, resilience and endurance. I think it is more the story of life as we know it, than it is about the two sisters alone. It is like asking a few people to write down their life stories and then choose two mundane, probably boring lives, to highlight our own journeys for us all. Or it can also be the gossip stories about neighbors from the cradle to the grave, and how we react to it.Picturesque, detailed, touching. For me the value lies in the time period it was written and the reminder it is of lives that was lived differently from our own and what we could learn from the experience. I loved it.

In many ways this 5 page preface is more compelling than the actual novel. Here he relates an anecdote of sitting in a favorite cafe when an old woman comes in talking to herself and dropping her parcels. She is the subject of immediate ridicule by the two waitresses, one old enough to know better and one young enough to be more charitable. He muses that this fat, ugly, old woman was once young, slim, perhaps beautiful but most certainly free of her ridiculous mannerisms. He continues that thought with the realization \u201c\u2026that the change from the young girl to the stout aging woman is made up of an infinite number of infinitesimal changes, each unperceived by her\u2026\u201d This is the story he writes but with two sisters, Sophia and Constance, whose lives he chronicles from girlhood through old age across a canvas that stretches from a provincial English town to Paris and back. Initially published in 1908, the story is set in the mid 19th century.This is a book of small moments \u2013 the petty disappointments, jealousies, power struggles and vanities that are woven into every life. There are no grand gestures here. Joselito in his review absolutely nailed it when he wrote, \u201cIt's an exciting, unputdownable reading frenzy of non-events.\u201d The lasso? Bennett\u2019s deft observations and characterizations. I can\u2019t think of another writer who has captured youth and aging better than he. On youth: \u201cAs for them, they marveled at the phenomena presented in Sophia\u2019s person; they admired; they admitted the style of her gown; but they envied neither her innocence nor her beauty; they envied nothing but her youth and the fresh tint of her cheeks.\u201d On aging: \u201cNothing could destroy the structure of her beauty, but she looked worn and appreciably older.\u201d On acceptance: \u201cThe truth was that, though her bereavement had been the cause of a most genuine and durable sorrow, it had been a relief to her. When Constance was over fifty, the energetic and masterful Sophia had burst in upon her lethargic tranquility and very seriously disturbed the flow of old habits. Certainly Constance had fought Sophia on the main point, and won; but on a hundred minor points she had either lost or had not fought. Sophia had been \u2018too much\u2019 for Constance, and it had been only by a wearying expenditure of nervous force that Constance had succeeded in holding a small part of her own against the unconscious domination of Sophia. The death of Mrs. Scales had put an end to all the strain, and Constance had been once again mistress in Constance\u2019s house. Constance would never have admitted these facts, even to herself; and no one would ever have dared to suggest them to her. For with all her temperamental mildness she had her formidable side.\u201dBennett underscores that no life is ever small to the person living it. Think about that for a moment: no life is ever small to the person living it. Annie Lamott once wrote, \u201cI may not be much but I\u2019m all I think about.\u201d Bennett's sentiments exactly. A pitch perfect novel \u2013 recommended without reservation.Note: I read the Modern Library edition which shows a date of 1911 but I don't think that's right.

Then he imagined her once as a vivacious young girl, perhaps pretty when she was a young woman, had some love affairs, married, brought forth children, and now she's like that, most likely alone and forgotten. For a long while he thought of writing a story about an old woman like her. When he finally got himself into writing it, he thought it would be more challenging to write about two of them, so Arnold Bennett made them sisters--Constance and Sophia Baines.Life, aging and death. We follow the story of the sisters' two-penny lives (spoiler alert: read on!). They live in a small English provincial town above their father's draper's shop. We see them when they were small girls, grow up to be young women: Constance marrying a local guy (and later inheriting her father's business), while the more spirited Sophia steals money from her aunt and elopes with a playboy traveling businessman to Paris. She remains childless, abandoned by her husband, but by stroke of luck was able to put up a business and prospered. Constance, on the other hand, stays in their town, has a son, sees her loved ones grow old and die one by one (her parents, friends, her husband). Her son leaves to seek his fortune elsewhere.In old age the sisters are briefly reunited. They shared problems with househelps, their dogs, and Constance's son's apparent neglect of her. Then they, too, die one by one.You yawn and ask inwardly: why then is this a 5-star? Because this is a masterpiece of realistic writing, Bennett's description of the everyday, humdrum happenings of ordinary 19th century people sucks you inside the book and makes you feel the characters like they're real flesh-and-blood. It's an exciting, unputdownable reading frenzy of non-events. A remarkable example of the old-fashioned way of telling a story, utilizing no attention-getting, sophisticated-sounding modern tricks. Something you'll miss when you get back again to the great, unreadable novels of the current times where you have to pretend understanding them, or deceive yourself into believing that you somehow got the point of your 3-week reading labor, to give them a decent rating."}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie", "userReview": "Arnold Bennett is one of the great under-read authors ever.

Bennett was despised by the Bloomsbury group, particularly Virginia Woolf, who thought him conservative and vulgar; his popularity made him a figure of envy and ridicule amongst the Modernists. Obviously he\u2019s got much more in common with Trollope, Thackeray and Dickens than he does with Joyce or Woolf herself \u2013 but he was also very much influenced by French writers, particularly Maupassant, and this is the \u2018Frenchest\u2019 of all his books, with some of the most powerful sections set in Paris. The Old Wives\u2019 Tale is the story of two sisters, Sophia and Constance Baines, their contrasting characters and destinies, their estrangement and final reunion in old age. In the course of the book they run the whole gamut of experiences open to women of that period, and the final section is deeply moving. The prose is breathtakingly good, the characterisation powerful and the subject matter (particularly in the Paris sections) unflinching. Bennett will never be fashionable: he represents a type of prosperous, worldly-wise English gentleman, and obviously that\u2019s just not very cool. But only a fool would dismiss him for that \u2013and it\u2019s worth pointing out that Bennett, unlike the pampered denizens of Bloomsbury, actually wrote to make a living."}, {"userName": "Rob Roy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2614179-rob-roy", "userReview": "The story of two sisters moving through life to their twilight years.

His breathtaking detail and description is something to behold.The story begins around 1840 in the Stafforshire pottery town of Burslem, where young sisters Constance and Sophia Baines work in their parents' draper's shop. They are initially close but contrastingly different girls, Sophie the younger considered incorrigible by the more proper Constance. As they grow up the girls drift, mentally and geographically, apart. Later also set partly in Paris, the tale tracks each sister, separately, into the full bloom of adulthood, the prime of maturity and the frailty of their dotage. It concludes in 1905.The book divides into four parts. The first, 'Mrs Baines', introduces the two sisters and those around them, in their bedridden father's combined shop-cum-house overlooking the town square. With their father ill, the sisters' primary parent is their mother. By the end of this section, rebellious Sophia has eloped with a travelling salesman, while obedient Constance has married her parent's shop employee, Mr Povey.The second part, 'Constance', follows sensible Constance through to her grey haired retirement, when she reunites with her long lost runaway sister. Her unremarkable life is defined not by adventure or outstanding accomplishments, but by deeply personal events, such as her husband's death, her growing worries over her son's life decisions and social behaviour.The third part, 'Sophia', follows passionate young Sophia after her elopement. Deserted in Paris by her husband, she survives the odds, becoming a successful pensione proprietor.The fourth part, 'What Life Is', sees the two sisters reunite. Worldly old Sophia finally returns to her Burslem childhood home, which plain old Constance has never left.It's mindboggling that one man could have created so much intricate detail in these wonderful Victorian characters. How on earth did he achieve this?In his initial published introduction, Bennett mentioned his debt to Guy de Maupassant's Une Vie (that same introduction originally included a nod to W. K. [Lucy] Clifford's Aunt Anne, but her mention is intermittently omitted from various subsequent editions and is permanently absent by the 1983 edition). Bennett's inspiration for the actual story was triggered by a chance encounter in a Paris restaurant, as he recounts:...an old woman came into the restaurant todine. She was fat, shapeless, ugly, and grotesque. She had a ridiculous voice, and ridiculous gestures. It was easy to see that she lived alone, and that in the long lapse of years she had developed the kind of peculiarity which induces guffaws among the thoughtless. I reflected, concerning the grotesque diner: 'This woman was onceyoung, slim, perhaps beautiful; certainly free from these ridiculous mannerisms. Very probably she is unconscious of her singularities. Her case is a tragedy. One ought to be able to make a heartrending novel out of the history of a woman such as she.' Every stout, ageing woman is not grotesque\u2014far from it!\u2014but there is an extreme pathos in the mere fact that every stout ageing woman was once a young girl with the unique charm of youth in her form and movements and in her mind. And the fact that the change from the young girl to the stout ageing woman is made up of an infinite number of infinitesimal changes, each unperceived by her, only intensifies the pathos.Perfect in every way, I have never read anything in this category that surpasses this in literary quality or storytelling. Why this is not more famously celebrated I can't imagine. No major updated screen adaption has eventuated since the 1921 film The Old Wives' Tale starring Fay Compton, Florence Turner and Henry Victor, other than the 1988 BBC TV series Sophia and Constance starring Alfred Burke, Lynsey Beauchamp and Katy Behean.I adore this oft overlooked great classic. Everyone should read it at least once in their life."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "THE OLD WIVES\u2019 TALE.

I\u2019ve known for years that this was considered his best work, and had even broken myself into his style by reading one of shorter works first, now I\u2019ve done. It is the story of two women, sisters, Sophia and Constance. Sophia was the younger. We meet them when they are young teenagers, growing up in their father\u2019s house, attached to his millinary shop. At the time, their mother wants to take them out of school so that they can help in the shop. This was fine with Constance, but definitely not what Sophia wanted in life. The two girls ultimately split apart; Constance staying at home and working at the store, Sophia running off with a travelling salesman, who takes her to Paris. The salesman, Gerald Scales, is a bit of a cad, and tried to get her to France without marrying her, but Sophie had more sense than that. Scales had just inherited twelve-thousand pounds from his family and decided that he didn\u2019t want to go into the family business either. The stories of the two girls diverge from there, and the author follows their lives until they are old women \u2013 the old wives of the title. This is a slow-reading book, and gets sentimental at times, but Bennett managed to write a novel in the French Realism style and to do it very well. Today, we have heard all of these stories before, but at the time they were a revelation to the English reading public. This edition contains a foreward by Bennett who explains how he came by the title for the book. It is quite revealing about a writer\u2019s inspiration.

Wells may think this book is a masterpiece, but I myself don't see the allure. The Old Wives' Tale tells the story of two sisters, only one year apart, and their journey from lively young girls into unhappy old women. One sister, Sophia, runs away with a handsome man only to be trapped in a loveless marriage until her husband deserts her a few years later. Intelligent and resourceful, she manages to make money running a hotel until her 50's, never truly happy but at least feeling like she has a purpose. Her older sister, Constance, marries a shopkeep, and is moderately happy until he dies, leaving her a widow with a spoiled son to raise. Both women are finally reunited in their old age and live together, both compromising their happiness for some companionship. Eventually they die, tired and used up.Seriously. That is the plot of this book. Sorry if I spoiled it for you, but I sort of wish someone had spoiled it for me before I wasted two weeks reading it. Okay, I'm being a little harsh here. The writing was, at times, beautiful, and the characters really did represent the tragedy of our short time on this earth. But the whole thing was so depressing it was hard not to throw the book across the room. I know that in real life we often end up unhappy and alone, but I don't need to read about it in books. I'm not asking for a sappy, happy ending, and I don't mind a little realistic suffering. I think the problem here is that I didn't care enough about these women to cry for their ruined lives, their unhappiness just frustrated and annoyed me. Perhaps it's a brilliant masterpiece of its time, but I think there's a reason few people read it today."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8443959-diana", "userReview": "Constance and Sophia are two sisters born into the narrow but secure world of their parents' drapery business in the Potteries. The Old Wives' Tale is the story of their lives from girlhood to old age and it is a remarkable masterpiece.The life experiences of the two are vastly different, yet in essence they end up living the same life. As products of a hard-working, respectable trading class, their values are with them for life. Bennett puts the women centre stage, and male characters are peripheral, leaving Constance and Sophia free to make their own choices. The balance between the two stories and the parallels in detail are finely crafted and give resonance and texture. For example, hot air balloons make an appearance in both strands of the story, separated by many miles and years; and an execution features in both.The psychological insight is acute. The account of lives lived in the Potteries between 1860 and 1908 is a fascinating and invaluable document.

I\u2019ve occasionally recognised, over the years, the not-so deep fact that the way one perceives the quality of a book can in fact depend on one\u2019s own mood at the time. I remember once reading Bleak House as part of my student studies and I read it in 100 page chunks: well, it remains one of my all-time favourite books, a complete masterpiece; but pages 301-400 were quite poor\u2026Maybe I happened to be in the right, receptive sort of mood here too. Who cares \u2013 try to ensure you are too, gentle reader. If so, you will encounter a quietly unpretentious but nonetheless moving exposition of \u2013 simple life. The soul of the book lies in its simplicity, its affectionate insights into unexceptional people. True, part of the novel uses the Franco-Prussian war and its effects on Paris as the backdrop: I found myself almost \u2018resenting\u2019 that drama! Because it is the quiet trickling of the sand in the hourglass that is the heart and soul, the glory, of this work. Quietly, almost before you realise what he\u2019s up to, Bennett has described what growing old looks like. Not particularly in any wistful sense of losing one\u2019s strength or faculties (though that\u2019s part of it): but simply, an account of what time does to two normal, very human, sisters.For me it was as if Bennett had played some kind of trick. As if I spent the larger part of the book admiring his ability as a watercolour painter of life. But when the sisters got back in touch with each other I found I had to stop reading: my eyes had got so gummed up with tears that I couldn\u2019t see the pages properly. That\u2019s not the effect of a watercolour; it\u2019s the full-on blast of an oil painting, rich and profound. I had no idea Bennett had it in him \u2013 or could find that in me!Lovely book. My only, utterly footling comment in the other direction is Bennett\u2019s tendency to use a kind of Franglais to show off that he knows his French, even though he is writing in English translation. For example, when Sophia is unwell, the doctor does not say \u201cget some rest\u201d \u2013 Bennett insists on putting the words \u201cRepose the most absolute\u201d in his mouth. You wouldn\u2019t mind if it wasn\u2019t such a sure-footed, perfect piece of work \u2013 but that is plain silly.Never mind. Bennett\u2019s work was once derided by the luvvies of Bloomsbury \u2013 not modern enough, too rooted in the narrative traditions of the nineteenth century, and so on. Goodreads\u2019 own, stupidly patronising summary of the book is an example of that too. Well, for me, never mind that either: the nineteenth century was when the art of the novel arguably blossomed to greatest effect, and this is bang in that mainstream for me.

I wondered if I'd started another which would be a slog. Not a bit of it, I'm happy to report. Primarily characterization with some small plot to go with it, it is no wonder this is on both Bloom's Western Canon and Boxall's 1001 Books - and maybe other lists, too.Bennett gives us the inspiration for his story in a preface to the edition I read, wherein he states that he frequented a certain restaurant in Paris. ... an old woman came into the restaurant to dine. She was fat, shapeless, ugly, and grotesque. She had a ridiculous voice, and ridiculous gestures. ... I reflected concerning the grotesque diner: \"This woman was once young, slim, perhaps beautiful; certainly free from these ridiculous mannerisms. Her case is a tragedy.\" He then was reminded of de Maupassant's Une Vie. He thought he could make something of these two observations. Bennett decided to write his novel about the lives of two women - sisters, who he named Constance and Sophia Baines. Their ages were sixteen and fifteen; it is an epoch when, if one if frank, one must admit that one has nothing to learn: one has learnt simply everything in the previous six months. In the first about one-quarter of the novel I noticed such small witticisms. Perhaps they continue, but I stopped noticing them if they are there. Published in 1908, it follows the lives of Constance and Sophia over the next forty plus years, from the mid-1860s to the early 20th Century. It is not a Victorian novel, although it takes place in Victorian England - he is able to say things that I think might not have gotten by Victorian censors. Her passion for him burned stronger than ever. She knew then that she did not love him for his good qualities, but for something boyish and naive that there was about him, an indescribably something that occasionally, when his face was close to hers, made her dizzy. Very tame by today's standards, yet there it is - a woman has passion, a man makes her dizzy. I don't know that I really liked these women to the point I would have wanted to spend time with them, so much as I came to know them and respect them.

So relieved. I really need to quit subjecting myself to the nauseum that is Victorian novels. Absolutely nothing happens in this book with the exception of the sections dealing with the youngest Baines daughter, Sophia.Sophia is the only one in the family that actually lived. She left the tiny town of Bursley for, in my opinion, stupid reasons, but she left. And she lived a life worthy of talking about. Constance, the elder sister, sat around, got fat and complained about her sciatica. I think she needed a backiotomy.Considering this book is old and if you read the introduction (at least the introduction in my copy) there is no such thing as a spoiler, so here comes a spoiler.Arnold Bennett is a stone cold killer. Of all the characters given ample page time, they all die. And they don't die interesting deaths, they die boring old age deaths.Here is the problem I have with Victorian novels. They all center around women. Kidding, there's more to it. They all center around women that are supposed to be bucking the societal trends for women of the time. Either they want to marry for love and not wealth (although they always marry for wealth, love just happens to be a convenience) or they are living the feminist lifestyle and can do anything that men can do aside from peeing standing up without making a big mess.This was Sophia, she fell in love and left Bursley against her family's wishes and mine. She traveled and experienced the world, fell out of love, because it turned out her worthless cad of a husband was indeed, a worthless cad of a husband. He admitted to marrying her just so he could get inside her girdle. Thank god those times are past, have to get married just to get some nookie (right, Fred?). Now, all of that stuff happens on the second date. Intercourse happens on the second date, right?Going on, Sophia's marriage falls apart, she becomes a successful business lady, moves back home to be with her ailing sister. Finds out that her husband, whom she hasn't seen in 36 years is ill. Travels to see his idle body, then gets sick on the ride home and dies. WTF! She was the only interesting aspect of this book. Then you go and kill her, Arnold. I hate you so much.Anyway, I'm putting off these crappy books for awhile. Gonna read some self-help stuff that my mom gave me instead.

It wasn't really exciting, or novel, nor were the characters that compelling - and yet, it was thoroughly good. The preface helped me to like it, I admit. Bennett writes about seeing two older women in a restaurant and feeling curious about what made them so different and yet brought them to the same place - and wanting for a long time to explore that idea in his writing. So this novel is really focused on the idea that small everyday choices build upon each other and that it is these, more than even the seemingly larger decisions of life, that form our character and even our appearance, and determine where we end up and how. It was this theory that held me throughout the book, and that I could relate to - in fact, I feel as if I have known Constance and Sophia - I have witnessed these kind of lives. And in that sense this book felt contemporary - it is the kind of thing that happens every day. It was about details, about mundane events, and yet, it was not boring or bleak. I respect Bennett's skill to be able to have Constance look at her sister's life and comment that it was largely about nothing (when her own life was equally so, although she took a different path)- to be able to acknowledge that without being overcome by it? Really great writing. Now if only it had been more exciting, I would have given it 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Bob", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82944-bob", "userReview": "With one exception, all of Arnold Bennett's fiction was published in the couple of decades following the death of Queen Victoria, yet in tone it is much more Victorian than Edwardian (certainly none of your post-Eliot modernism can be detected at all). In his stated attempt to emulate Flaubert, Zola and other French realists, he has a few startling passages (for example, an attempt to represent the pains of giving birth) that one is hard put to imagine in Elizabeth Gaskell or even the Brontes.Following two sisters who become separated throughout much of their adult lives, spanning two countries and much of the 19th century, Bennett is credited with being a faithful depicter of the emotional lives of women - in his amusing and informative introduction to my Penguin edition, John Wain comments that it is easy for men to say that but all the women he's asked agree.The crisis points in 19th century literature are not infrequently hinged on medical afflictions and treatments that seem incredible to the modern eye - \"mucous fever\" requiring immersion in ice-cold water at 3 hour intervals for days on end is a climactic but somewhat inscrutable point in this one. While not commenting directly on that diagnosis, Bennett has many engaging asides generally on the inexorable march of technological progress and the reaction of each successive generation to these advances."}, {"userName": "carl  theaker", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3381893-carl-theaker", "userReview": "A momentary self-congrats: with this novel, I finished the Modern Library top 100.Only took me about 5 years, but I did it.This novel was a worthy finale being quite a tome, 620 pages, and since writtenin the early 1900s, was worried it might be difficult.However it was a pleasant read, the story of the Baines family, primarilyConstance and Sophia from their teens through old age and death.

My enjoyment was no doubt increased by the fact that I learnt a lot about the Siege of Paris in 1870, and also because I was constantly reminded of my grandparents and great-aunt, although they were born around 1900.

According to Wikipedia: \"Enoch Arnold Bennett (27 May 1867 - 27 March 1931) was an English novelist. ... He won a literary competition in Tit-Bits magazine in 1889 and was encouraged to take up journalism full time. In 1894, he became assistant editor of the periodical Woman. He noticed that the material offered by a syndicate to the magazine was not very good, so he wrote a serial which was bought by the syndicate for 75 pounds. He then wrote another. This became The Grand Babylon Hotel. Just over four years later, his first novel A Man from the North was published to critical acclaim and he became editor to the magazine. From 1900 he devoted himself full time to writing, giving up the editorship and writing much serious criticism, and also theatre journalism, one of his special interests. ...In 1903, he moved to Paris, where other great artists from around the world had converged on Montmartre and Montparnasse. Bennett spent the next eight years writing novels and plays. His most famous works are the Clayhanger trilogy and The Old Wives' Tale. ... Bennett believed that ordinary people had the potential to be the subject of interesting books. In this respect, an influence which Bennett himself acknowledged was the French writer Maupassant whose \"Une Vie\" inspired \"The Old Wives' Tale\". As well as the novels, much of Bennett's non-fiction work has stood the test of time. One of his most popular non-fiction works, which is still read to this day, is the self-help book \"How to Live on 24 Hours a Day\". \"", "title": "The Old Wive's Tale\n      \n          (The Five Towns)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9937104-the-old-wive-s-tale", "average": 3.81, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1302094623l/9937104.jpg", "reviews": 223, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3314.Arnold_Bennett", "name": "Arnold Bennett"}], "type": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9937104-the-old-wive-s-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188454.The_Old_Wives_Tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/578586.The_Old_Wives_Tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8985951-the-old-wives-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2277053.The_Old_Wives_Tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34736594-the-old-wives-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6238153-the-old-wives-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2685515-the-old-wives-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/625092.The_Old_Wives_Tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2796514-the-old-wives-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7105149-the-old-wives-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4855.How_to_Live_on_24_Hours_a_Day", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4860.Anna_of_the_Five_Towns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1925773.The_Grand_Babylon_Hotel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1327976.Clayhanger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2381867.The_Card", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
