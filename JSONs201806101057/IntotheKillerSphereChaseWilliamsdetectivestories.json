However, it does not take him long to make friends with detective Angelo Alunni in Tursenia and get invited to crime scenes.The detective calls him in again when foul play is suspected at the villa of sixty-nine years old Piero Galli who is found dead lying on his library floor. They soon round up the suspect, dissecting their lives and getting up to speed with the events that lead up to the murder. Piero's wife has decided to change her will and disinherit the entire family. It did not go off well and the killer is not finished yet...My comments: A delightful detective story written for a female audience. All the elements combine perfectly to give it a light, and skillful touch. There's enough spanners thrown into the works, mmmm...if some tools can be called spanners...to make it a wonderful adventure in trying to figure out the clues. Most of the neighbors, or characters then, are likable, even the grumpy ones!Sooo, for all the closet-detective ladies in us: hit this novella.

More than that, I really enjoyed Cutting Right to the Chase, the previous book by Stefania Mattana. Mattana is an Italian born and raised writer living in Britain. Her character, Chase, is a British, born and raised former detective of Scotland Yard, now living in Italy. That little twist helps in the writing. I am not sure how she does it but you can almost hear the Italian accent in the Italian characters. Chase, the lone Brit, is very British. There is no mistaking that in his language. In many books it is relatively easy to forget the British characters nationality, not here, Chase probably sticks out quite a bit in the medieval city of Tursenia where he lives. Chase is a former detective. The reason as why he is a former detective is a bit of a mystery. He hasn't even told his friend Inspector Angelo Alunni, who uses Chase as a consultant, the reason. All that Chase lets on to is his discharge, not dismissal, was because he was responsible for a big mess. Chase is now called in to help Alunni in solving the murder of Piero Galli, a wealthy resident of Tursenia. The scene looks like an accident. A chandelier fell on Galli killing him. Chase sees more, and the investigation begins.In the previous book I compared Chase to a grown up Encyclopedia Brown. In this novel there is still some of that and maybe a bit of Columbo too. Chase is a likable character and very much a realistic one too. He is a genuine nice guy and usually only gets agitated by cigarette smoke and when his running is disturbed. Mattana writes a good old time mystery. It is not a CSI type book or a detective who crosses the line the get his man. Into the Killer Sphere is a mystery, safe (and clean) enough for all ages and yet engaging enough for adults looking for some light reading. As I said earlier, I usually don't read mysteries but, Mattana's books are a very welcome break from my usual assortment on non-fiction reading."}, {"userName": "Rita Monticelli", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8856621-rita-monticelli", "userReview": "Scroll down for the English version.Attenti alla sfera!Dopo aver conosciuto Chase Williams nei brevi racconti di \u201cCutting Right to the Chase\u201d, aspettavo con ansia di vedere questo personaggio alle prese con un caso vero, con una storia complessa, per scoprire come se la sarebbe cavata. Il nostro Chase in questo \u201cInto the Killer Sphere\u201d (altro titolo a doppio senso, che gi\u00e0 di per s\u00e9 \u00e8 un piccolo capolavoro) si trova di fronte al classico omicidio avvenuto nell\u2019ambito di una ricca famiglia, i cui membri, nessuno escluso, sembrano esserne i sospettati, un po\u2019 per il loro comportamento ambiguo e un po\u2019 per il fatto che possono beneficiare in qualche modo della morte del congiunto. Eppure \u00e8 tutto molto bizzarro, a iniziare da come la vittima \u00e8 morta, tant\u2019\u00e8 che la storia si concentra molto pi\u00f9 sul come che sul chi, il quale a un certo punto pu\u00f2 essere intuito dal lettore particolarmente attento.Chase con i suoi modi un po\u2019 goffi, che forse portano i sospettati a sottovalutarlo (altro elemento dei gialli classici), cela per\u00f2 una perspicacia senza eguali nel seguire tutte le tracce, persino quelle pi\u00f9 insignificanti, e arrivare alla soluzione, senza che il lettore sia in grado di stare dietro ai suoi ragionamento, finendo per essere colto dalla sorpresa della rivelazione. Il lettore non ci sarebbe mai arrivato, sebbene fosse tutto davanti ai suoi occhi, come nella tradizione dei grandi gialli.I miei complimenti a Stefania, questa Agatha Christie sarda che segue egregiamente le orme della grande giallista e che, sono certa, ci far\u00e0 vivere ancora tante divertenti avventure per le strade di Tursenia.Beware the sphere!After getting to know Chase Williams in the short stories of \u201cCutting Right to the Chase\u201d, I was looking forward to seeing this character dealing with a real case, with a complex story, to find out how he would fare. Our Chase in this \u201cInto the Killer Sphere\u201d (another title with a double meaning, which in itself is a small masterpiece) finds himself before the classic murder that took place in the context of a rich family, whose members, without exception, seem to be the suspects, because of their ambiguous behaviour and for the fact that they can benefit in some way from the death their relative. Yet it\u2019s all very bizarre, starting with how the victim is dead, and actually the story focuses much more on the \u201chow\u201d than on the \u201cwho\u201d, which at some point can be understood by an especially careful reader.Chase with his awkward manners, which maybe bring the suspects to underestimate him (another element of classic detective stories), however, conceals a unique insight in following the traces, even the most insignificant ones, and coming to a solution, whilst the reader is unable to stand behind his reasoning, only to be caught by surprise with the final revelation. The reader would never come to it, although it was all in front of their eyes, as in the tradition of the great detective stories.Congratulations to Stefania, this Sardinian Agatha Christie who follows admirably the tracks of this great writer and, I am sure, will make us live yet many fun adventures on the streets of Tursenia."}, {"userName": "Christoph Fischer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13998364-christoph-fischer", "userReview": "\"Into the Killer Sphere (Chase Williams detective stories #1)\" by Stefania Mattana is a very enjoyable and well written thriller set in a atmospheric medieval-looking city in contemporary Italy. Chase Williams from the UK is called upon to assist his friend Inspector Angelo Alunni in a case that seems like an accident but highly likely isn't.Together the pair combine forensic and personal intelligence to get to the bottom of the case.The investigation is one wonderful and charming journey through Italian idiosyncrasies with amazing colourful characters.The plot is cleverly woven and told with attention to detail.

I found the protagonist, Chase, already quite charming from the start, from the glimpse I got from the short stories, so I was interested to see how he would deal if he were presented with a beefy case, not a small ordinary crime, but a real murder.Well, I was not disappointed! Inspector Alumni needs to figure out who killed Piero Galli and calls for the help of Chase, who reluctantly agrees. As Chase is not a police officer, his role is more of a background one, or at least, that's what it seems. Still, he has the ability to ask the right questions to the right people at the right time, and this includes the suspects, the forensics team, his own colleagues. I had the impression that for a guy who was called in to 'give a hand' he was actually doing more than his fair share. He's clearly a dedicated hero, someone who truly cares about finding the truth.I was trying to picture who the murderer was from the start, and even when there was a second attempt at killing, I was far from the truth. The end was a surprise for me and I was really fascinated by how Chase had managed to figure it all out, from such small clues, and put all the pieces of the puzzle together. This was a great book, I will definitely want to read more about Chase and further cases he will have to solve in the future."}, {"userName": "Alan Hardy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13307914-alan-hardy", "userReview": "Chase Williams, once a young detective in London, is now living in the Etruscan city of Tursenia in the Italian Appenines, and working for a cashmere company.

There are a number of suspects in the household, including a Romanian housemaid, as well as the deceased\u2019s mother, daughter, brother and sister-in-law, and one or two others.

Then two people disappear on the day of Piero\u2019s funeral\u2026 And is there also something to do with the dogs not barking? This is a classic whodunnit. A dead man, and a house full of suspects. As we follow Chase in his investigation, the deductive skills shown, and the explanation of the murder, and the person or persons responsible, speak much not just of Chase\u2019s detective ability but also of Stefania Mattana\u2019s great talent.

The main character, Chase, which I already knew from \"Cutting right to the Chase\", is fascinating and well depicted. He grows on you.

The \"mystery\" was not mysterious; I identified the killer the minute the character was introduced. Figuring out \"whodunnit?\" is not the only pleasure of a mystery/detective story, however; I have enjoyed many books where the bad guy was obvious from the beginning, yet the author held my attention with strong writing, character development, an intriguing setting, or interesting clues. Unfortunately, Into the Killer Sphere contained none of these.Mattana's writing was pedestrian; everything unusual or surprising was described as \"weird,\" and I couldn't help snickering every time grown men referred to each other as \"big boy.\" Chase Williams, the former British police officer now playing amateur sleuth in Italy, was a cardboard character; the brief references to the incident which led to his departure from England, far from being intriguing and leading the reader to want to learn more about his back story, were ham-fisted:It was another lie, another thing, like the one which had hurt his mother and let down his brother, Scott. Another thing which made his father even more infuriated with him.He had needed to give some explanation for his move to Tursenia without revealing the real, awful reason.The Italian setting was irrelevant to the story, which could have taken place anywhere.With the exception of one deduction related to the dogs, none of the \"clues\" advanced the story; in fact, Mattana's description of the facts which led to Williams's identification of the killer was internally inconsistent. Had the killer not acted, for some bizarre reason, in such a way as to out him/herself at the end of the book, none of the \"evidence\" relied on by Williams would have supported an arrest, much less a conviction.Readers looking for mysteries with a real sense of Italy should check out Maurizio de Giovanni's Commissario Ricciardi series. Those interested in a damaged hero with an intriguing back story should consider Mo Hayder's Jack Caffrey series. Give Chase Williams a pass.I received a free copy of Into the Killer Sphere from the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Shawn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7412425-shawn", "userReview": "Italy is a country that can bring up a lot of mental images to a person. There are the obvious ruins of the Roman Empire. Others may picture villages surrounded by lush fields with grapes or some other crop being grown. The other being a country steeped in tradition where families are united and stay on land for decades. Lastly there is the dark side, and that is a country that was influenced by the Mob.It is the small picturesque beauty and quaint towns that brings ex-detective Chase Williams to the town of Tursenia to escape his office job in England. It\u2019s a quaint little village with some interesting town\u2019s people. One of whom seems to find himself being a village parking attendant, but you will have to read the book to find out about that. The important thing to Chase was getting a vacation and enjoying a place where he could run without distraction. The problem with the modern age is there is this thing called a phone and if people know where you are they will call. This happens to Chase Williams and the call is from an old friend, Detective Angelo Alunni who would like some help on a potential murder. A well-known, but not as well liked man Piero Galli was found dead with a chandelier being the cause of his death. Others want to mark the death was accidental, or even suicide but Alunni questions that finding and thus brings in Chase.Into the Killing Sphere is written by author Stefania Mattana who writes a very good mystery in what is not her first language. She makes use of the small Italian town and the way of the locals in a way someone would have grown up knowing. I tease as her Amazon author page will tell you she is from Sardinia, which is just off the coast of Italy.What Mattana does with her book is paint a very interesting case of potential murder. The main family is run, almost ruled, by an older woman. A rich woman who\u2019s family is almost typical of many splintered families. As often is found, where there is money there is a \u201cmessed\u201d up family who wants their share.The main character, Chase, also has a bit of a mystery behind him as well. He is willing to help his friend but will not step foot in a police station. He is ex-Scotland Yard and readers may wonder why. We get an idea it has something to do with his father but that is one mystery that is not solved within these pages. What makes this interesting is how it makes meetings between Alunni and Chase seem a bit clandestine, and adds a small additional flair to the store.The reader will be introduced to many characters in this book and if you read carefully enough you may get an idea on who the murderer is before Chase. This is because the clues are explained in just enough detail that you could figure it out. The flip side, as in many good detective novels, you may find out you are wrong.The interaction with Chase and the locals can be problematic at times as his Italian isn\u2019t the best. It in a way reflects some of the struggles Mattana may have had when writing her first stories in English. So I like to think that may be this was a bit intentional. The key thing is as you read the book you get introduced to a well written story. One that can be a throwback to those well written detective stories by other great authors. Either way it\u2019s a good read or something that mystery readers will enjoy. Also due to the way it is written fans of other genres should also find this a great quick read. Why quick, well it is only 73 pages from the Amazon description. However, if you are like me and after reading this book you will be happy to learn there were short stories prior to this book."}, {"userName": "Bridget", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19650611-bridget", "userReview": "Inspector Angelo Alunni has a problem on his hands \u2013 a possible murder in his small town, where every person close to the deceased has motive but not means. Can he break the case before another family member is taken out?The story:Chase Williams is taking a well deserved break from policing in the small Italian town of Tursenia. Unfortunately, Turensia is the home of his childhood friend, police inspector Angelo Alunni. When Piero Galli dies under a falling chandelier in his stately but isolated home, Angelo convinces Chase to come and help out at the crime scene.Against Chase's will he's pulled deeper into the mystery. Under what circumstances did Piero die? His family knew he'd spoken about changing his will. Was it his brother? His sister in law? His elderly mother? His ex-addict granddaughter? There was no evidence left at the scene of the crime, and as far as Chase can see, the Italian police keep allowing the family to contaminate it out of respect for their feelings. There also doesn't seem to be a strong motive. Can Chase solve the mystery and keep the rest of the family alive?The style:Into The Killer Sphere has a good strong plot, certainly. The characters are all honestly written, particularly Chase, whose point of view we see the most of through a classic third person limited perspective. The pacing is great, and carries the story through just the right length. But Into the Killer Sphere has something about it that raises it above your classic crime novella. I absolutely loved it, and I think the reason I loved it so much is two-fold:Firstly, the sense of place is impeccable. Tursenia, to which I have never been, came alive on each page. I could see it, smell it, and I lived it during the reading experience. Mattana has a real way with description, she doesn't go overboard, but every tiny detail she puts in really gives Tursenia three solid dimensions. The setting put this story above and beyond your classic Agatha Christie, because there you are, in Italy, and I mean, like, REALLY in Italy. Stunning.The second reason I really loved this book is linked to sense of place, in the way that the story is so Italian. Mattana's grasp of English, which I believe is her second language, is flawless, but the way she uses English is influenced by her knowledge of the Italian language, and this gives her a rare poetry that I think native English speakers just don't have the capacity for. I am lucky enough to come from a small port city in Australia with a huge population of Italian migrants, so I have experienced the way Italians put their own inflections and translations into the English language, and this book so perfectly reminded me of the way Italians speak, gesture, and describe every day life. It seems like such a rare talent to be able to write such a great story in your second language and have it stand out for that very reason, and for that I applaud Stefania Mattana.Who is this book for?If Agatha Christie is a bit dry for you, definitely give Into The Killer Sphere a go. It's only seventy five pages. You can knock it off on the bus to and from work, and you'll laugh. And love it. And it's cheaper than a cup of coffee to download it to your kindle. There is literally NO REASON not to read this book.If you like this book, you would also like...There's more Chase Williams! Yay! Also, Chase is very techno savvy, he's on Twitter and all.

This was the first book, which I\u2019ve read in the Chase Williams mystery series. However, I don\u2019t feel like I was at a disadvantage compared with other readers. The author did an excellent job introducing me to the lead protagonist. I found Chase to be a complex and engaging character. He was very likeable and easy to root for through out this fast-paced detective story. As other readers have already mentioned, the book follows the former detective Chase who is dragged into a murder case (staged to seem like an accident) by an inspector friend. The book is set in Italy. The landscapes and locales are described with finesse. There is a nice balance between lush detail and pacing. The author is adept at avoiding overkill when it comes to description. Stefania Mattana has an intriguing style to her writing, which draws you and makes you feel like you are there in the environments with the characters. Each character felt unique and authentic to his or her own ethnicities as well as personalities.This story kind of reminded me of an old Tintin detective/adventure tale. There were plenty of twists and turns as well as refreshing humor thrown in for good measure. Like any good mystery tale, there is tension and intrigue woven through out the web of clues. I think Into the Killer Sphere would appeal and be appropriate for readers young and old. I enjoyed how enough information was given so that I could try to sleuth out the case along with Chase. Although my theory ultimately proved incorrect, I enjoyed how the tale was eventually resolved. Some detective thrillers leave me feeling unfulfilled and cheated, because the final plot twists and culprit(s) come out of left field. I appreciate how Into the Killer Sphere is grounded in reality and doesn\u2019t try to blow the reader\u2019s mind with shocking final twists. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the book is in anyway predictable. There are multiple layers to the plot, and I was kept guessing/sleuthing through this quick read.I highly recommend this book. As mentioned earlier, this was the first book that I\u2019ve read in the Chase Williams series. I think it succeeded as a stand-alone book, but it also left me inspired to read more.

The lead character is a bit of \u2018fish out of water\u2019 type\u2014a former Scotland Yard detective plopped down in Tursenia, Italy. There\u2019s only a hint of back story about how that happened, so there may be more Chase Williams to come. The setting was pleasant, breezy even, and the characters amiable, even though there\u2019s a murder at the center of the story. This quick read has an interesting cadence to the narrative. By that I mean that I could almost hear a lilt of Italian in this story even though it is written in English. I\u2019d call this a \u201cgentle\u201d mystery and more novella than novel, given its length. Not much blood and guts, no one terrorizing anyone, although there\u2019s a bit of skulking going on.

The mystery plot is very simple yet intriguing: a domestic incident turns into a murder case as Williams best friend, a Tursenia police homicide detective, doubts about the accidental nature. It turns also out that all the family members involved in the death of Piero Galli have a reason to kill the man. Only Chase\u2019s deductive skills and the help of Galli\u2019s dogs can help Tursenia police close the case. This is a very traditional cozy mystery that finds its original flavour into the Italian setting and the side characters.

This time, Chase has to help his friend Inspector Alunni of Tursenia police solve a murder case. The plot is developed like the most classic whodunnit and I quite liked it, also because the book is the first of the Chase Williams Murder Mystery series - to me it\u2019s good to start reading a series with some guarantees.The potential suspects belong all to the same family and each of them has a good reason to kill the victim. The background of the story, which has a brilliant yet classic ending, is the beautiful Italy and its interesting lifestyle, so different than Chase\u2019s.

In this story one of the residents of the town, Piero Galli, is found dead, apparently a victim of a fallen chandelier. Or is he? That is what Case and Detective Alunni must discover.
