I can say Seattle a few more times if you'd like. :)This series has a lot of potential. I think this is a good start but it's still rough. Something about the book was off and I can't tell you exactly what. For one thing, even though this was published in 2006, it felt more like it was written in 1995, specifically around technology. (She's a PI but uses a pager and doesn't have a cell phone? And her printer uses fanfold paper so it can't be more sophisticated than a bubblejet.) She also refers to the Bon Marche which went out of business in 2005. I know it takes some time for a book to go from draft to published but the buyout by Macy's was well known for quite awhile before it happened.) The explanations for and descriptions of the paranormal in this world are way too convoluted, long, and mostly unnecessary. The action is all too similar and a couple of loose ends were never tied up. I think she tried too hard at first to make Seattle feel real. She didn't get anything really wrong but it didn't feel right to me as a native either so I wasn't surprised to find she moved here later in life. Her descriptions of Pioneer Square were really good, though also a little off, like she drove through it a couple of times rather than being personally familiar with it. (I used to work down there and FYI, although the Frontier Room is as awesome as she describes, it's in Belltown not Pioneer Square.)Harper is a strong woman but quite stubborn and not that bright. She's pretty cowardly in many parts, too reckless in others but amazingly rational in one scene when she realizes she shouldn't confront the men breaking into her office. She accepts the paranormal too quickly but it takes her too long to acknowledge what has happened to her. She doesn't want to accept it so she fights to avoid her powers even when it's obvious even to her that ignorance is going to get her killed. Ostrich-->sand. I wanted more variety in the action, especially with her taking an active role rather than having things happen to her. In fact, in one extremely important sequence she spends most of the time just watching and then tries to run when she's needed. (Another reviewer pointed out that this scene was unintentionally comical genius. I agree that it wasn't meant to be but was.But in her world, men and women were equals without gender stereotyped roles. The love interest is a great guy and it's just a part of the story; she's not constantly pining and fantasizing. Nor is she worried about clothes and makeup all the time although just about every one of plethora of characters in the novel are tall and thin/skinny/slender/anorexic except for three really annoying jerks. This is Seattle. We usually are more worried about whether someone looks like they are healthy and a good hiker or biker than whether they're tall and skinny. Think outdoorsy, organic-eating coffee drinking REI types rather than rail-thin models. It's a stereotype, true, but a pretty accurate one for the types of people in the parts of town in which everything in the story happens. I think it's her California transplant showing. I definitely feel there are characters who have potential to be quite interesting in future books. The story itself was good and though I figured the mystery out much before all was revealed, the plot was still all right. I do plan to read the next one. Some day."}, {"userName": "J.L.

First off, it's nice to see a female paranormal detective character whose actual cases seem to have more weight than her love life. Normally there seems to be a strict gender divide in these things -- men like Harry Dresden and John Taylor occasionally have girlfriends and occasionally have horrible luck with women*, but generally that's not a major focus of the books' attention. Female urban-fantasy detective-types, like Vickie Nelson or Jill Kismet, tend to meet some hottie on a case in their first book and then most of the time the two are in the same room we switch modes so quickly I can hear the brakes squeal. And Vickie and Jill are the ones I remember because they weren't as bad as many. It seems like Men are from Noir and Women are from Romance. * Few main characters seem to be gay or bisexual in these books. The only exception I can think of is Lilith Saintcrow's Dante Valentine, who had a female lover in the past and a male lover in the present. Even then, the gay relationship ended Badly. But, that has nothing to do with anything, unless you count the fact I spent ten pages thinking Harper was male in Mean Streets, well past a date with a guy. I didn't notice this with Harper, in that she strikes up a date with an auctioneer she meets in passing, notes that she wants to keep things low-key until the case she's working on ends, and the book makes it clear that he's not True Love, or even that Harper is going to meet some guy and do the mode switch like that. (I have a soft spot for some romance, but boy am I picky about it.) Anyway, to actually talk about the plot and not vent about My Thoughts on Romance, after an accident, Harper develops the ability to see into the supernatural world and manipulate it. She thinks she's going crazy until a sympathetic doctor steers her towards some friends that specialize in weird stuff. On the job side, Harper takes a job to track down a missing college student, and locate an old piece of furniture for an elderly man. It was nice to see the cases weave together, in that there was no plot-related reason to think they were connected, but Harper uses information from both to connect them. It also gave a better sense of 'this person has a real job', and doesn't just get weird cases dumped on her doorstep one at a time by the Paranormal Fairy. (I think that Storm Front did that too, only the cases were actually connected.) One of the flaws is that I think the book tried to push Harper's powers as 'too much, too soon'. There are a lot of info-dumpy things from Harper's teachers, and thanks to some Trouble Harper gets into, she gets a boost to her powers (with unknown side-effects). I'd rather see her powers, and Harper's initial skepticism towards them, develop a bit more slowly. The book also introduced a lot of supernatural beasties at once. The ferret scenes were also adorable, in that Chaos acted like a ferret, and not some kind of fuzzy prop. I have a soft spot for animals, and my sister owned a ferret for years when we were kids."}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "It's very hard to write a helpful review of Graywalker. It simply didn\u2019t leave any kind of impression on me \u2013 good or bad. The first half was far more interesting than the second. It had the tone of a hardboiled detective novel and it was quite refreshing, so I was more than a little disappointed when it all went straight to hell in the other half. Harper Blaine is a good, strong character, but some of her choices weren\u2019t quite clear to me, and the love story (well, lust story, to be precise) was weird and unconvincing. And let me just say that I like my male characters tall, strong and dominant (don\u2019t we all?), but Richardson gave us a love interest who is ordinary, not too handsome and very whiny at times. I meet guys like that every day. Why the hell would I want to read about them, too?!The worldbuilding was unimaginative and colorless. I really wouldn\u2019t recommend this book to anyone except avid urban fantasy readers (Ooooops, I\u2019m alone on that island, and I\u2019ve read it already, so no\u2026 I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone at all).

Variety is the spice of life, so I\u2019ve decided to diversify and pursue six different lists simultaneously. This book falls into my FINISHING THE SERIES! list.I loves me a good series! But I'm terrible for starting a new series before finishing my last - so this reading list is all about trying to close out those series I've got on the go.2.5 rounded up to 3 because my wife and my mother-in-law both love it (and they might use tea-spoons to pop out my eyes if I give it a 2). It\u2019s a solid urban-fantasy effort with a good, strong female private detective (Harper Blaine) for a lead. She lives in Seattle, has a pet ferret, and is generally a likeable broad. The fantasy element is OK, but I didn\u2019t find it inspiring \u2013 Harper got killed by a client, and although the medics brought her back she can now see \u2018the grey\u2019. The grey includes ghosties, vamps, warewolves, etc \u2013 the usual bunch. It also includes misty visions of the world beyond death, or some-such. Good for atmosphere, bit vague for specifics.It was a fun and easy read, very much a scene setter for the series. Lots of effort put into grounding the story in Seattle (rather than generic American city as some UF is) \u2013 lots of resistance on Harper\u2019s part to accepting her new role as a \u2018greywalker\u2019, which kind of emphasises that this is a nice, normal gal who\u2019s doing her best to muddle through this otherworldly madness. Obviously the real fantasy hoodoo can\u2019t kick-off until she\u2019s accepted and embraced her ghostly powers. I\u2019ve been told this aspect picks up in books two and three of the series, which makes sense. There was one specific thing that annoyed me. People are revived by medics every day. What is it about Harper that makes her special? Why does she become a greywalker, and the next guy to get revived just get brain damage? It was all a bit wishy-washy and coincidental to keep my disbelief suspended.Maybe I\u2019ve just been spoilt by coming in at the top end of the UF market? Compared to Dresden, Castor, Grant and Swift... Blaine is too much the UF \u2018girl next door\u2019. I\u2019ve no doubt there\u2019s more substance there if you get to know her \u2013 but in a crowded genre, Greywalker doesn\u2019t make a strong enough first impression.Having said that \u2013 I will continue to read the series because my wife already owns them \u2013 but they\u2019re certainly not top of my wish-list...After this I read: A Clash of Kings"}, {"userName": "Felicia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia", "userReview": "This was a Vaginal Fantasy pick from Bonnie!

Unfortunately in literature, a rising tide lifts all boats, even those of less than stellar construction. Greywalker is an ok premise with faulty execution. The pacing is off, the story jumps around like a 9 year old on a sugar high. And it's set in Seattle - which would ordinarily be great, except that even as someone who lives in Seattle, I can tell you that this is one vast injoke of locations and happenings that people outside Seattle won't enjoy.Characterization is a bit weak, too - we're introduced to neat characters like a locksmith with an eye on the supernatural, but get no depth on him.

In the first few pages she is brutally attacked by a man she was tracking down for a client. After she leaves the hospital, Harper begins to see strange shapes and disorienting mists all around her. Thinking she is experiencing the lingering effects of head trauma she returns to the hospital. Once there, her doctor informs her that she actually died for two minutes as a result of her attack. He thinks the new sensations she is now having are not medical at all, and refers her to some people he thinks can help her. From them, she learns that she is a Greywalker. She has become one of the rare people who can physically exist in our world and in the supernatural world, which is called the Grey.Ok. Great premise! I think this series has a lot of promise and I will certainly read the next book in the series.However,I did have a few problems with the book. First, when Quentin installed a security system in her computer, he used a floppy disc. I checked, and the first printing of this book was 2006. Can anyone tell me the last time someone used a floppy disc? Do they even make them anymore? This guy was suposed to be some kind of James Bond with electronics. It made no sense. Maybe she could unwind at night by playing her state-of-the-art Atari, too. Sorry. Maybe I'm just being too picky. The second thing I thought was a little disjointed was her love affair with Will. I kept thinking that it would somehow become relevent. It didn't. It was just an annoying distraction to the story...and then he left. Ok, this last thing really did get under my skin. She was constantly disoriented. I mean all the time. Yes. All. The. Time. It seemed like every page was a description of her getting sick. If she wasn't clutching her stomach or swallowing bile, she was throwing up or falling over with vertigo. I understand that she would have had a hard time getiing used to the two realities, but still. I kind of expected it to get a little easier for her by the end of the book. It never really did, and to be honest, I felt a little ill myself by the time I was done reading it. Having said all of that, I think this series has real potential and I'm anxious to see where the author goes with the story."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/163750-nicole", "userReview": "Overall, a pretty good book. Richardson definitely knows her way around a well-crafted sentence and a well-imagined world. But definitely, progressively, weird and dark.I like Harper for the most part; she's complex and not a cliche. Aspects of the story reminded me of the Harry Dresden novels, although Harper is not nearly the smart-alec Harry is. A little more humour would've been nice. Harper is the first character I've ever seen with a pet ferret, and that added a few moments of much-needed levity. I thought it was interesting how Richardson starts with the incident that causes Harper to become a \"Greywalker\" and takes Harper through the process of trying to learn to adjust, instead of starting with the weird occult talents already established. While we're told that Harper is pretty much shell-shocked and falls back on her private detective habits as a coping mechanism, there are a few things to which she seems to under-react in a manner that Fox Mulder would commend. But at other times, we see her literally gutwrenching, skincrawling reactions in Technicolor. Mara and Ben are interesting characters, although a few of their conversations seemed to go on a bit too long without making as much progress as I would've liked. From the blurb, I didn't expect the novel to be so thick with vampires; but they were rather different from other vampire depictions I've seen, and they weren't one-note. I hope for a little more romance in the Will situation. Quinton is definitely useful but a mystery."}, {"userName": "Yzabel Ginsberg", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg", "userReview": "2.5 stars.

I like Harper, and her ferret, and some of the supporting characters, but there is a lot of weird, disjointed stuff going on and the pacing and transitions are jarring and odd. She resists and resists getting pulling into the paranormal, and boy is it a slow first 1/3 of the boom, but suddenly she's deliberately stirring up trouble for the most dangerous guy in town and associating with seriously scary and creepy people. The author throws in big words unnecessarily, awkwardly introduces background/reseach about Seattle, and introduces the concept of The Grey in a way that doesn't make sense to the characters or me. At 2/3 through the book, the story is focusing on her client and the trouble he's in but I still have no idea why she's bing attacked repeatedly, what her unusual Grey power is, why she's in danger in the Grey when the oddly overly informed but still completely wrong witch tells her she isn't, etc. I just keep making notes about things that are throwing me off and don't make sense. There are way too many coincidences and easy outs (she happens to get treated by a doc who takes this stuff seriously, who happens to know the couple of profs who study this stuff, she suddenly has a bunch of clients who have paranormal connections...) I like Harper somehow, but I'm only mildly curious to find out what happens. If I were reading a print book I'd just flip to the end and wrap it up. I may go find it in a bookstore or library at some point so I can do that. Maybe it will inspire me to try the book again, but for now I have so many other books I'm eager to get to that I don't want to spend more time on this confusing and only mildly interesting story."}, {"userName": "Gary Foss", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15798988-gary-foss", "userReview": "In the interest of full disclosure I have to start with a note: I'm so sick of vampires that I'm considering going full Van Helsing on the next person who even recommends a freakin' vamp story to me. Old style Van Helsing too; not pretty, Hugh Jackson in a floppy hat Van Helsing. I'm talking head chopping, mouth stuffed with garlic, burned up at sunrise. I need another vampire book in my life like I need to test drive a late model AMC Gremlin. At this point, anything I read that is going to have vampires in it better have something brand-spanking new about it: vampire bunnies that shoot lasers out of their eyes, a mamma vampire who throws her babies like ninja stars, a vampire colony on Mars that's terrified of an alien invasion from Earth mutants. (Hm. I kinda like that last one....)This book has vampires, and while there are some tweaks, they don't transform into monkeys or wear power armor, so it's going to annoy me right off the bat. It didn't START with vampires, though, so when the hints of their existence began coming in, my reaction was to roll my eyes, and by the time they actually became a major feature I was close to calling it a day. To me, vampires make everything worse because they are so cliche that I just don't want to bother. If you're not done with vampires, then you'll probably have a better reaction than I did.Other than vampires, where this book stands out is in Ms. Richardson's strong, and even elegant prose. Upon occasion she goes a bit overboard and dips into strangely clausal sentences, but for the most part her prose and vocabulary have a distinct and entertaining flair. Apparently, some readers have felt she uses too many \"SAT words\" but I found that vocabulary apt and referential to certain noir detective stories. A comparison to Hammett or Chandler is high praise--but not unwarranted.The world building is solid and interesting, if a little abrupt. What I mean by that is that there are several \"mentor scenes\" in which the dynamics of the world are explained more or less in exposition outright. The protagonist doesn't \"discover\" the world, but is guided through it, meaning the reader gets it as a sort of instruction manual. The idea of a world behind the world we live in isn't particularly new, but Ms. Richardson does have a flavourful take on it, and her version of the spirit world accompanies her prose in an effective, descriptive way. Getting that information expressly in lectures and monologues rather than having the lead experience it herself is more often than not a missed opportunity.The physical structure of the book is sometimes a bit odd. Chapter breaks occur in the middle of the action, while more natural breaks are sometimes ignored. So, some chapters are quite short while others quite long, making the book as a whole sometimes feel terse and at other times meandering. This isn't really a problem with the plotting, however, but with the book's physical layout, which makes for a sometimes strange reading experience. I can't say if that was entirely intentional on the author's part, but I have noticed several big names doing something quite similar, and having a lot of success with it. The books themselves don't differ significantly from earlier books in terms of plot and pacing, but the chapter breaks just appear in strange places... so it seems to be something of a writer/editor/publisher thing.There are three storylines going on in this book; the heroic journey/discovery of the Grey by the protagonist, a vampire/missing persons case, and a search for a lost artifact. For the most part, they interact smoothly, though on occasion the transition is a bit jarring. Waking up next to her lover (part of the heroic journey storyline) after having had a particularly devastating interaction with a vampire (the vampire/missing persons storyline) was a little awkward. The comments/reviews I've seen from other readers have expressed some concern with elements of consent in that sequence, but it really just read as a jump cut in the plot to me. However, most books can't manage two storylines with any particular depth. Given that there are three storylines going on here, and all three are pretty involved, I think we can overlook a single stutter.The action sequences read particularly well, especially the opening sequence in which the protagonist, Harper, is assaulted, dies for two minutes and is brought back to life, now with the ability to see into The Grey. (That's not a spoiler--this is chapter 1) Ms. Richardson captured several elements of that sequence that are apt for a female leading character (in particular, getting her hair caught in the elevator) that might not occur to a male writer. Tapping into that creates an interesting level of anxiety that I think many male readers might find surprising and female readers particularly pointed. For some reason, \"death by ponytail\" is more horrifying to the fairer sex, where being killed by one's coif just isn't an issue for we tripods. It likely has to do with our relationships with our respective hair care professionals, and the looming specter of male pattern baldness....I did find it a little strange how often people did things for free. A nightclub bouncer just calls her up and gives her information for no compensation; a widow digs through files for old receipts (who keeps that kind of thing?) make copies of them (widows have Xerox machines in their homes, I guess) and gives her cups of coffee because she's lonely, apparently; paranormal experts/scholars are just waiting around for the chance to help her out with her whole existential crisis--and they feed her home made pie. That ability does move the plot along, but it would have seemed more likely had she glad handed a few folks.Personally, I found the love interest more obligatory than anything else. Most of the secondary characters had distinct, interesting personalities, even the minor ones. I got more of a feel for the character and personality of Harper's pet ferret, Chaos, than I did for Will. Tall, white haired and a knowledge of antiques doesn't really set my panties on fire, but I guess that may be why I prefer boxers. Your mileage may vary.I like that Harper is not a kick-ass-and-take-names-later, hard-boiled super-hero cum detective. Two guys bust into her office, and she calls the cops. Nice. A little action sequence is good from time to time, but similarly it's interesting to get the opposite.With those things in mind, this is an early novel for Ms. Richardson, so there are a few problematic sequences and story dynamics. For instance, I had some trouble with what I call \"the metasuspension of disbelief.\" That's the moment when the characters of an urban fantasy see through the \"real world\" into the supernatural aspect of the world they inhabit. In that moment, the reader must be able to accept that supernatural aspect right along with the characters, but also must be able to believe that the characters can believe it. In this case, Harper's struggle isn't so much with the reality of the situation, but whether she's going to accept being on her hero's journey (as Joseph Campbell would say.) She has little problem with the idea that there's a whole world existing as an alternate dimension parallel to our own, even though that's the kind of information that would put most folks in a padded room right next to the Joker. Instead, she just doesn't want to deal with it. Rather than \"I can't believe it\" we get \"I don't wanna.\" That isn't a great reaction to getting a glimpse behind the curtain at the fundamental nature of the universe. That section read as either very rushed or a pat, obligatory interaction meant to tick the \"Refusal of the Call\" box for the Monomyth. (Campbell again... sorry for the academia.)Meeting a real life vampire is similarly a fizzle. And it's a fizzle for everybody. Her instant friends are cool with letting a classic monster archetype into their house--a house with a newborn baby in it, mind you, which seems like the kind of thing social services would get involved in: \"Do you have any dogs, exotic pets, or blood-sucking murderous undead monsters in the house? Oh, yes, those kinds of things are sometimes child welfare and safety hazards. Yes, yes, I know, I love dogs too....\"Instead, they're fine with it, even though they don't know enough about that kind of thing not to offer him some pie. They just assume that if the ghost that lives in the house (a sort of silent guard/messenger/pet) is cool with the vamp then it's all good. \"Here's some tea, you can stay in our basement.\" Really? Later, we get an explanation (their house is on a sort of magical nexus and protected by wards) but--again--they weren't real clear on how vampires eat, and he's a twitchy, shaky, unpredictable newly undead, so where's the new parent angst? No second thoughts at all about the vampire in a house with your child? I've seen mommies and daddies be more concerned about the style of bottles they're going to use.Overall, I can recommend this book if you're looking for something relatively light, AND not sick to death of vampires. I'll happily give it a star for the writing and another for the complexity of the plot. I can't really go more than that for a vampire book in the 21st century, but I'll readily admit that's something of a foible, so ignore it at your discretion."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50378-angie", "userReview": "Once again, the cover struck me first. She looked interesting to me. Like she knew things. And I liked the slanted city she leaned up against, looking like a character in its own right. I love it when a particularly city or a particular building is a main character in a story. The whole thing is that much richer for it. The good news is I wasn't wrong. Harper Blaine does, in fact, know things. Things she'd rather not know, as it turns out, but know things she does. And the Seattle of Greywalker is a dark, wet, teeming character, and you can tell Kat Richardson knows her way around the place and loves it for all its dark, wet, teemingness.Harper Blaine is a P.I. who finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time and winds up dead. For two minutes. After she comes to in the hospital things are....different. Suddenly she sees shadows and outlines of figures who aren't there. At least not on this plane. And just like that, she's forced to accept a whole new worldview. One in which the creatures of nightmare and fairy tale drift along beside the living. They exist in an alternate plane known as the Grey and Harper is a greywalker, a mortal who can cross planes. What that ultimately means is up to Harper to find out. Fortunately, she has a few good friends to help her figure things out, including a witch, a ghost, a couple of vampires, and one extremely tall auctioneer with silver hair.In case this description sounds like the last urban fantasy you read, let me dispel that thought. Greywalker reads like Raymond Chandler meets Charlaine Harris' Harper Connelly mysteries. The emphasis is on the noir, hardboiled private investigator about town. At first, the paranormal events are almost an afterthought. They come to play a much larger role as they begin to alter Harper's life, but the mystical never overshadows the gritty, real feel of the book. It was a nice surprise, different from what I was expecting, and I enjoyed getting to know Harper and how refreshingly adult she was about things--her job, her relationships. Not always trying to prove her worth to anyone and everyone who crosses her path. I look forward to following this series as it develops."}, {"userName": "Bry", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1360862-bry", "userReview": "This book was just one big bag of meh.

There is too much going on and because of that the author doesn't have enough time to adequately flesh out the issues. The 2 cases could have been elaborated on so much more, but then would have made the book too long. Honestly each case was interesting and could have been a book unto themselves and separated the cases and given them different lynch pins plot wise. The cases depended on one another which was interesting, but still just too much going on. 2. Even though the book was written in first person from Harper's perspective she still kept so much information from the reader. How fucking annoying is that!? Harper would have this amazing epiphany that was integral to the story, but totally not allow the reader to experience it with her even though we are reading the damn book as her! This happened multiple times and was more and more annoying each time it happened. 3. No one reacts like they should! Oh vampires exist? That's cool. Of witches exist. Awesome. Necromancers too? Cool! WTF?? Seriously, this is a universe like ours were the paranormal is not seen as real. So any normal person, even one who believes these things do exist (which Harper didn't) would still express some amount of surprise to learn for sure that the creatures live alongside them. The only reaction I found to be accurate was Cameron's mom (Cameron was turned into a vamp and told his mom about it and naturally she thought he was lying and was on drugs or something.)Anyways, guess I am glad I tried the series out so I know to cross it off my list, but I don't ever see myself reading any more of Harper's escapades."}, {"userName": "Schnaucl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/345066-schnaucl", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. I liked the protagonist. I wasn't really sure of her age. Usually in urban fantasy books like this one the protagonist is early to mid twenties but I think Harper may have been more in her thirties. That, or she doesn't have a problem with dating people much older than she is who she believes to have a teenage son.I really liked all of the second tier characters. They were fun, interesting, and seemed to have some depth. I do have a few concerns though. First, I'm a little tired of the protagonist having to be just a little more special than everyone else. She's not only supernatural herself, she's the extra special kind. But all the other urban fantasy books are doing it so it's not fair to single out  Kat Richardson.I did wonder more than once if this was a manuscript that had been worked on for several years and not updated. There were a couple of minor but glaring things. Most people would not use a \"floppy disk\" to transport programs these days, they'd use a USB Flash drive. Hell, some computers don't even have floppy drives anymore. There was one other general thing, which escapes me, it may have been a reference to videotapes rather than DVDs.I'm from the Seattle area so there were a few irritating things there, too. Safeco Field was named in June of 1998 but is only referred to as \"the new baseball stadium\" in the book (twice). I'm not sure she really gets the feeling of the place either. If it weren't for a couple of landmarks I wouldn't have known it's Seattle. Yeah, there's a lot of coffee being drunk, but no mention of Starbucks, SBC or Tully's. And at one point she mentions the city continuing to get rich off sin, which I don't get. Maybe if you're talking heroine use, but she was talking about strip clubs and I dare you to try and get a strip club started around here. There was an illegal ten year moratorium on them that just ended and they're still fighting about it in court. It says in her bio that she's a recent transplant from CA and I think maybe she just hasn't plugged into the culture all the way yet.Still it really was quite an enjoyable read and I'll definitely read the rest of the series"}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4717699-tiffany", "userReview": "I'm sad to say that I lemmed Greywalker at 84%. It's the first time in many, many, many years that I couldn't face finishing a book. I was actually really drawn in at the beginning and found the concept of the Grey really intriguing, but the plot went all sorts of downhill from there. The characters are all really flat, and Harper was so one-dimensional I found her scenes painfully awkward to read. You know nothing about her backstory really, and her whole persona simple revolves around her being a badass. Except, that really isn't enough to carry the book, and made understanding her motives near-impossible. Bearing in mind she was a private investigator, you'd think she would have bothered to investigate the person who attempted to run her down or break into her office or trash her house... hmm? Instead she ended up helping Cameron, who she owed absolutely nothing to, and threw herself voluntarily into the vampire world, deciding to take down the head-honcho who wouldn't teach vampire-stuff to Cameron. I mean, couldn't Cameron learn that from anyone else, at all? Also did the other vampires really need to wait for someone like Harper to come along to wage their little war against Edward? Harper also took an extraordinarily long time to get used to the idea of being a Greywalker, yet didn't bat an eyelid at the existence of vampires. The married couple she seemed to visit every 5 minutes were pretty much useless, and despite their connection and knowledge of the Grey, weren't really able to offer her any assistance. By 84% I had no clue why she still kept going around there... Mara even admitted to knowing about the weird magic piece of furniture yet didn't think to tell anyone that it was pretty much sucking the life out of everything. Urgh.Harper was also a complete jerk to Will, Quinton and Albert, who had all been nothing but nice to her. In short, I didn't really enjoy Greywalker.

She now sees ghosts and attracts otherworldly business as she pops in and out of a shadowy overlapping world. Harper seeks the assistance of Ben Danziger, self-proclaimed \"ghost guy\" and linguistics professor, and his wife, Mara, a witty Irish witch. They educate Harper on the Grey, \"a place between our world and the next.\" Harper tries to maintain a normal life, dating a sexy antiques expert while battling wits with Seattle's vampire king, but being a Greywalker means she can only \"pass for human.\"The Grey is a place where ghosts live, and all times overlap the present. There are hungry creatures in the Grey, too, and Harper's ignorance of what is going on there threatens to kill her again, this time permanently. There's a subtle hint in the book of a family connection of being a Greywalker. Obviously the more you read this series, the more we learn about Harpers new abilities.The heroine, Harper Blaine, is a very likable character who draws you into the story. Richardson does a fine job in portraying the tension between Harper's new life and her nostalgia for the simpler more clear cut world she inhabited before her injury. Several sub characters are also nicely portrayed - the young college student (Cameron) who has gone missing and bitten and turned into a vampire; Quinton the computer 'geek' who matter of factly helps Harper even as he perceives the truth of her situation, and Will an attractive antiques dealer who hopes to be a permanent romantic person in Harper's life.There are a number of other supernatural forces dealt with in this book; primarily necromancers, witches, and ghosts that are all part of Harpers attempt to find Cameron and locate a missing antique which is cursed. There was also brief mention of werewolves and the inclusion of the Guardian of the Grey.

Well I have mixed opinions on this one and here is the reason why. Ok its not the first \"I see dead people\" book and certainly will not be the last. Ok it makes are bit more of a refined approached to it with (and no pun intended) fleshing the idea out more. There is more to the \"Grey\" than just ghosts - but that is as far as I will go without giving things away. However the book feels like the main character Harper the Greywalker spends more time refusing her gift than getting to deal with it - her idea of a solution seems to run away and pretend it does not exist. Ok human reactions I know but when it is repeated through the book it does get a little tedious (not often I want to slap a character) that said I am sure in later books (and there are several) things will change. Then there is the back story already there are hints that there are longer story arcs in the wings than just the crime of the week that Ms Blaine is getting pulled in to - of course involving the grey however again this is to be explored in later books. Then there was the storyline - I found at times to get in to - ok when I was reading I could not put the book down but in passing when I looked at the book and thought do I want to read some more its like hmmm possibly, ok what else have I got on the go.So here is my dilemma - do find the next book (considering this was a charity show give away) and risk wanting to slap her again or do I walk away and thinking not bad with some good ideas, ok whats next!"}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8476972-kristen", "userReview": "Honestly the worst book I have read in a long time.

It's refreshing because the main character is a bad-ass not because of any particular special powers she might possess but because she's tenacious and experienced at the PI game, has some friends helping her who are just as new to the phenomenon she's witnessing as she is, and due to some twists and turns along the way.

Greywalker was a title I purchased when it first released, in 2006. Eight years later I finally read it. Oh, the shame. Because Richardson is part of the Urban Fantasy movement as I like to call it. When the genre finally started to hit big in the 2000s. Ironically 8 books later it's clear this is a top series in the genre, so much so that I've been faithfully buying them without ever reading a single one. Which for me is big. It was magic when I finally started up Greywalker and it just clicked. The writing for Greywalker is amazing. From the world building to the characters. Seattle is so fleshed out that Richardson's rendition of has already popped up to my top 5 for written version of the city. (There are a lot of UF titles in Seattle.) This is a debut title, yet the writing is so sophisticated and never loses it's soul. The best part is there were some new words that I had to look up in the dictionary. It gives me shivers when words are used in a new way and I actually have to brush up on my vocabulary. It seems like authors tend to recycle descriptions and phrases, a lot. This isn't a show of how to use big words or anything like that. It's simply an author showing us the magic of her writing style, and I loved it. What I love the most is how readers slide into Harper. We're there for the incident as she dies and comes back. The slow realization as she comes to terms with the fact that she's not crazy, she's seeing ghosts and the likes. She's a practical PI and at know point does Richardson try to glorify Harper. Nope instead Harper states PI work is usually dull and except for the rare crazy\u2014such as what led up to her brush with death\u2014it's fairly safe. A lot of titles try to bash readers brains in with the weight of how hard this new reality is and how the character can't cope. AKA endless denial that is beyond painful to sit through. (Cough. C.E. Murphy. Cough.) What I appreciated is that Harper is a skeptic, but she can't live in her denial. Her fears are totally understandable and I felt them right with her. What\u2019s more is readers get to know Harper and she becomes a friend, there\u2019s still some mysteries\u2014like her mother\u2014but we know her. The cases Harper picks up all seem normal, but soon take a twist for the Grey. Giving readers a great peek behind that shadows as to what might be lurking. And maybe Harper becoming a Greywalker wasn't such a random act? The plot also helps to bring in some great characters. Such as the Danzigers, who are a married couple and their new baby. The wife happens to be a witch and the husband an open minded scholar who might be a bit more out there then is hocus-pocus wife. The Danziger's house is haunted by mysterious ghost, and conveniently located on a ley line. There's also an interesting enough love interest to spice things up, but is not the focus of the book. This book is about the mystery and showing off what feels like very authentic PI-ing. Since I'm not a PI I can't say how close it is to the job, but what Harper describes is a bit more believable then the many PI employed Urban Fantasy leads out there. (Not that I don't enjoy them to death!) Best part is the magic isn't about flash here. There's a bases for everything and I greatly enjoyed all the theorizing about it. The magic felt solid and real. As if I could actually step right into the world Richardson has created.This book has smarts. Despite the humor and rich world presented, I have a feeling readers are going to love it or find it dry. Either way it's well worth the gamble! Some might fine Harper a bit of a loner, but if you where having strange experiences that might lead you to believe that you\u2019re crazy, holding people at arms length might be appealing. As a start up there's a lot we don't learn about Harper and we're learning about the Grey and the things thought creep in it a long with Harper. The bare glimpse of the vampire society leads me to believe that I'm going to like the vampire lore found here. Even more I love how endless, but grounded, the magic appears. I'm all in for the next book and I feel justified for jumping the gun and buying every release. Sexual Content: Sex happens, but it\u2019s not graphic or in detail.

I usually complain when characters are made to make stupid decisions just to advance the plot. Especially because most of those times the characters are super cool and I hate to see them acting like idiots for the plot's sake. I prefer the story forcing itself on the characters and see them react to it. I love when a writer does such a job that no matter how clever the character is, avoiding the problem is no a viable choice. I remember having this problem with the early Dresden's books where Harry, great character as he is, used to choose the worst possible option out of maybe for or five of them and then complain all the while about why this or that was happening to him. Luckily, I kept reading the series and Butcher's writing style improved exponentially over the next few books facing Harry with real dilemmas.Anyway, what I was trying to say before going off on a tangent was that I usually like the characters but have problems with plots.In this case, though, the plot is almost flawless. I cannot think of anything that should have been done differently, but the main character annoyed me to no end. Two words keep flashing through my mind: Enough already!First, okay, so the Grey made the character sick. We get it. We don't need to read some variation of \"I fought my need to vomit\" or \"I vomit my dinner in the trash can\" in every other sentence. I feel like the book would have been 1/3 shorter without all the whining.Second, there's a line between a skeptic and just plain stupid. If it walks like a duck... I could understand when in chapter 3, 4 and even 5 there was some version of this dialog:Harper: I don't want this. It hurts!Mara: Because you're fighting it. Accept it and it'll stop hurting.H: But I don't want it. I want it to stop, to go away!M: I won't. This can't be undone. You need to accept it.H: But I don't want to be Grey! I don't believe it!M: You must.*Harper glowers and storms out without another word**Hours pass and then they talk over the phone or in person and...*M: I'm sorry I pushed you.H: It's okay.What?? Harper is being more than a bit dense and the only person trying to help her needs to apologize to her? I would have prefer the introduction of an antihero-type character. One of those that are not bad but can be pretty blunt and mean when the situation calls for it. Someone that could grab her and shake her and say \"snap out of it, you fool! You are what you are. Deal with it or you'll die. It's that simple!\" But no, we were stuck with her friends' niceties and her thickness forever. I mean, there is a version of that dialog almost word by word in chapter 28!! And the book has only 31 chapter. Imagine. And at that point there weren't other options. It was \"accept it or die.\"I couldn't care less about Will. He was just... there. Quinton, on the other hand, had more potential than what we end up seeing of him, so I hope he's more involved in the next stories.It wasn't terrible for a first book but between all the \"I'm feeling sick,\" the \"I won't believe in this stuff even if a Grey car runs me over,\" it was a struggle. The obvious details that give away the fact that this book was written sometime during the early 90's didn't help. It wouldn't have been a problem if some editor hadn't made the less-than-brilliant decision of adding a sentence at the beginning of the book saying \"I'll buy a cellphone someday\" and then performing a \"search and replace\" changing computer for laptop. That was annoying. Mi mind kept jumping back and forth between now and the 90's. It's not easy to imagine someone typing in a cool laptop and then printing their work on fanfold. Or no one having a cellphone (not just the main character but no one!) and using pagers. Or making sense of the dates for the case of the damn organ. But well, these were actually minor details.I'll give the 2nd book a shot and see what happens. If the writer can make Harper a little less annoying, I think we'll be okay."}, {"userName": "Susan Wojtas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7675235-susan-wojtas", "userReview": "DNF.

PI Harper Blaine lands in the hospital after a work-related brawl leaves her seriously damaged and dead for two minutes. Upon waking, Harper instantly notices things are slightly off, a little grey (literally) around the edges. Her injuries left her as a Greywalker, someone who possesses the ability to both see and walk in the Grey -- the space between the living and the dead. Prior to this revelation, the paranormal wasn't something that factored into Harper's everyday life, or even at all for that matter. It's all new to her and heeding the advice given to her by a very open-minded doctor, she seeks the assistance of two people who live every day in the thick of it, surrounded by magic, ghosts, the occult. They take Harper under their collective wing and despite much protestation and a heavy dose of disbelief, Harper slowly but surely learns to navigate this newfound territory. What she didn't expect is the amount of paranormal beings that come out of the woodwork seeking help and showing up most unexpectedly.Set in Seattle, a much darker version, Richardson marries a multitude of magics and supernatural beings that all have one thing in common -- the Grey. Very few living folks possess the ability that Harper now has, so she's really a unique character, albeit one who's now followed around by many types of critters. Once a true disbeliever, Harper is thrust into this unbelievable world and even finds herself embroiled in the affairs of vampires, of all things. Richardson's vampires are really quite a scary group and I can't wait to see how their structure and powers work. Readers were given a small glimpse of the inner workings of the vampire community and from the looks of things, we'll get more in the coming installments. One vampire in particular really caught my eye and I have a feeling he's going to play a much bigger role than what he's so far been given.Greywalker also has a small bit of romance. A blip, really and something that didn't even need to be introduced. The sex scenes were alluded to, the flirtations were over-the-top cheesy and that's the reason for my 3.5 rating versus a full 4. The relationship really didn't add much, if anything, to the storyline and was really quite forgettable. Although -- I do hope Harper explores a romantic relationship in the future with someone most unexpected and most importantly, not Will.Bottom line -- it seems readers either loved or hated this first installment of the Greywalker series. I personally really liked it, as it has many of the elements I like in my urban fantasy -- a darker tone and world, a variety of supernaturals, necromancers, and a romantic thread that doesn't overshadow the action and the suspense.
