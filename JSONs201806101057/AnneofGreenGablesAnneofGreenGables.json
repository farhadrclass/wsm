I've read the Anne of Green Gables series once before - over twenty years ago. In spite of the amount of time that has elapsed, I clearly recall reading the last book in the series very slowly and thinking to myself, \"I will be so sad to not be able to read about Anne anymore.\" When I picked up this book a few days ago to re-read it, I found within a few chapters that it was like seeing an old friend. Anne was even more delightful than I recalled, since I now have daughters who share her \"scope for imagination,\" her penchant for large words and her zest for life. Reading about Anne's appreciation for life's loveliness made me appreciate my daughters and long to live more in-the-moment myself. So, I decided that a book that feels like an old friend after twenty years deserves five stars.Anne Shirley must be one of the most delightful characters ever written, largely because she is far from perfect. She makes mistakes, as we all do, but her mistakes are much funnier than my own feel and she makes me see the value in learning from each of them, laughing at them and moving on. Like my middle daughter, there is no lukewarm with Anne. I love that she approaches life enthusiastically, despite have spent a decade belonging to no one.I also like that Anne talks straightforwardly about wanting, seeking and building friendships. Even now, I am hesitant, awkward and scattershot at building relationships. I may meet someone who seems a kindred spirit, but lack the time or, let's be honest, sheer boldness to approach them and seek to build a friendship. We see Anne seek and build relationships not only upon her arrival in Avonlea, but during her time at Queens.One reasons I re-read this book was because two friends recommended it for it's fluency in writing dialogue. Unlike Little Women, which I attempted to read for the writing, this book did not disappoint. The dialogue sounds exactly like each character would sound and it flows smoothly from narration to dialogue and back. In fact, I'm baffled that Little Women routinely makes top 100 lists while Anne of Green Gables is nowhere to be found on the lists of must-read classics. Unlike the Little Women characters who are archetypes rather than three dimensional characters, Anne is a bold a female character who refuses to be categorized. That's exactly why I love her and love this book."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10762033-maureen", "userReview": "\"Dear old world,\" she murmured, \"you are very lovely and I am glad to be alive in you.\"This quote really accurately depicts how Anne lives her life and what makes you love her as a character. She's stubborn and makes mistakes, but she also has a huge imagination and sees the world as beautiful and full of possibilities.I loved this SO much and I'm sad I never read it before! I love all the characters and the plot, and it's really fun to see Anne grow up through this book. The writing is also really really lovely.I can't wait to read the sequels and follow Anne's story!

I'm a sucker for a celebrity-narrated audiobook (if you haven't checked out Maggie Gyllenhaal's reading of  The Bell Jar, do that now!).It's wonderful to read a story that, for the most part, is extremely uplifting. There's hardly anything truly terrible that happens in this story, and that's quite refreshing. Granted, it is a children's novel and from the early 1900's\u2014so it has that moralistic quality to it wherein each incident Anne undergoes resolves itself with a lesson learned. But it was delightful, and Anne's optimism is contagious. Rachel McAdams also does a great job at encapsulating that attitude; I felt like I could hear her smile.If, like me, you've never given Anne's story a chance, I can highly recommend the audiobook route. And I'm definitely going to continue listening to this series, especially when I'm in need of a pick-me-up."}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "I'm so glad I've finally read this book!

This is just the most adorable, heartwarming book ever and I honestly don't think I ever read it before this week! I have the movies practically memorized and they follow the books perfectly, so there was nothing terribly new in this story. The only obvious difference was that Gilbert isn't in the book as much. But seeing Anne ramble on and on for pages more than made up for that. I just have to stick some of my favorite quotes in here:\n\"When people mean to be good to you, you don't mind very much when they're not quite\u2013always.\"\"One can't stay sad very long in such an interesting world, can one?\"\"Isn't it a wonderful morning? The world looks like something God imagined for His own pleasure, doesn't it? ...I'm so glad I live in a world where there are white frosts, aren't you?\"\"Isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?\"\"It's nicer to think dear, pretty thoughts and keep them in one's heart like treasures. I don't like to have them laughed at or wondered over.\"\"Oh, it's delightful to have ambitions. I'm so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to be any end to them\u2013 that's the best of it. Just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still. It does make life so interesting.\"\"I like people who make me love them. It saves me so much trouble in making myself love them.\"\"Ruby Gillis says when she grows up she's going to have ever so many beaus on the string and have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too exciting. I'd rather just have one in his right mind.\"\"Dear old world... you are very lovely, and I am glad to be alive in you.\"\nSo if you've seen the movies, you're not really missing any of the book.

In other words, a classic!The target audience is definitely not me. I would say it would be perfect for a teenage girl living in Canada in the early 1900s. That makes sense, because that is exactly what Anne is! However, the point of this obvious detail is that sometimes it is fun to read a classic and try to put your mind in the mindset of who it was written for at the time. A couple of the storylines seemed silly or to not make sense, but if I stopped and changed my mindset, it would click.A bit of a history lesson combined with a well written story.

She may be scrawny and freckled with red hair but she\u2019s also loving and bright with imagination. When she\u2019s mistakenly sent to Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, elderly siblings who plan to adopt a young boy to help around their farm, Anne faces the prospect of securing a home and a loving family \u2013 if she can prove she\u2019s worth keeping. First published in 1908, Anne of Green Gables has long enchanted readers, young and old alike. How could it not with such an effervescent heroine at its heart? Anne is a delightful companion with which to explore the splendor of Green Gables and the quaint town of Avonlea (a fictional town modeled after Montgomery\u2019s hometown of Cavendish in the maritime province of Prince Edward Island, Canada). Montgomery crafts such stunning descriptions of the terrain that her prose risks outshining Anne. With descriptive language that titillates the senses and the imagination, Montgomery brings the rustic setting of Avonlea to life. Gypsy winds, perfumed air, dew-wet ferns, woodland blooms, and trees adorned with glimmering gossamer are just the beginning of the wondrous discoveries made by Anne during her \u201craptured voyages of exploration.\u201d It was a pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads, with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom. The air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple. Wild cherry trees and rose bushes grow unfettered, and the birds are always singing, but one gets the sense that Anne Shirley could find happiness and adventure no matter where she goes, whether she be surrounded by beauty or not. Even though Anne\u2019s story is recounted through an omniscient narrator, readers experience wonder of the world as if through Anne\u2019s eyes. At every turn, her personality overflows and her indomitable spirit knows no bounds. She\u2019s an eloquent child with an adoration for big words; \u201cif you have big ideas,\u201d Anne insists, \u201cyou have to use big words to express them.\u201d She speaks in a refined manner that belies her age and can always be counted on to impart wisdom. You can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will.  Anne is a loquacious child with long-winded stints of dialogue. This trait was less noticeable when reading the book as a young girl and proved slightly annoying during this re-read as an adult. It\u2019s a defining quality of Anne\u2019s personality, however, something one cannot help but eventually love about her. There\u2019s a comforting predictability to Anne\u2019s bubbling personality; readers can always be certain that her uplifting thoughts and sophisticated proclamations will boil over and spill from her mouth with abandon. Matthew Cuthbert, much to his own surprise, finds Anne\u2019s chatter quite pleasant. Like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. Be he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Matthew Cuthbert is described as an \u201codd-looking personage\u201d with an \u201cungainly figure.\u201d He\u2019s a shy, quiet man who is made uncomfortable by most women, taking exception only to his sister and their gossipy neighbor who lives a quarter-mile away, Mrs. Rachel Lynde. Women were bad enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word. He\u2019s quite taken aback to discover a girl in place of the boy he expected to retrieve from the train station, but he\u2019s too kindhearted (and too cowardly) to leave her behind. He decides to escort her back to Green Gables so that his sister can \u201ctell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake.\u201d Marilla Cuthbert exudes none of the warmth found in her brother. She\u2019s a practical woman, tall and thin \u201cwith angles and without curves,\u201d who furrows her brows at wastefulness and excess. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously. Marilla insists that Anne be returned to the orphanage. When Anne asks if Marilla would keep her if she were a more attractive child, Marilla replies simply, \u201cNo. We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm. A girl would be of no use to us.\u201d Despite her stern countenance, Marilla agrees to accommodate Anne for the night and decides that, rather than sleep on the couch prepared in the kitchen chamber for the anticipated boy, Anne should sleep in the east gable room. While Anne sleeps, Matthew and Marilla discuss what to do about the \u201codd little figure\u201d with the \u201clong braids of red hair and the eager luminous eyes.\u201d Marilla is quite determined not to keep her, while Matthew reveals he\u2019s already warming to Anne\u2019s irresistible charms. \u201cMatthew Cuthbert, you don\u2019t mean to say you think we ought to keep her!\u201d Marilla\u2019s astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had expressed a predilection for standing on his head. \u201cWell now, no, I suppose not \u2013 not exactly,\u201d stammered Matthew, uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. \u201cI suppose \u2013 we could hardly be expected to keep her.\u201d \u201cI should say not. What good would she be to us?\u201d \u201cWe might be some good to her,\u201d said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly. And therein lies Anne\u2019s challenge: She must make herself useful around the farm and prove herself worthy of a home at Green Gables by staying out of trouble. But Anne and trouble go together like spring flowers and honey bees. Be it contending with Marilla\u2019s practicality, navigating the politics of a new school, solving the mystery of pesky boys, or trying to make new friends as an ungainly orphan girl, trouble is never far behind the efforts of Anne Shirley. If Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert can find it in their hearts to cherish this little girl, their lives will be made richer for it. And if Anne can stay out of trouble, she might just find a loving home in a beautiful place. With lovely prose and an unforgettable heroine, Anne of Green Gables is an endearing book brimming with scope for the imagination."}, {"userName": "Yaz *The Reading Girl*", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11014315-yaz-the-reading-girl", "userReview": "Finally: Full review written December 17th, 2013 and edited the 19th:) ***5 beautiful \"Kindred Spirits\" stars!!***Sighs...Anne of Green Gables and her crazy doings will forever stay in my heart <3.

Anne:Anne is an orphan girl who was adopted by Marilla and Matthew Curthbert...let's say she was meant to be a boy. She is an odd looking little girl with fierce red hair, freckles, gray eyes, and pale skin. She is a full kindred spirit and very imaginative.

From adventures,imagination, to meeting new friends, to accidents, to love, being smart, and turning into a beauty Anne's life is not what she ever thought it would be.\n\u201cIt's been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will.\u201d \nShe has a rival...the amazing Gilbert.

However, I didn\u2019t first read this book until I was in my 20s, and I was really missing out on something wonderful. But better late than never, right? I\u2019ve since read this book 4 times, and I\u2019ve loved it more every time I\u2019ve read it.Anne Shirley reminds me so much of myself as a child, minus the red hair. She\u2019s doggedly optimistic, though she can be incredibly dramatic when things don\u2019t go her way. She\u2019s always getting into scrapes that seem impossible, even though she always means well. She\u2019s a dreamer and a lover of nature and novels. I was all of those things as a child, and I think I\u2019ve done a pretty good job of maintaining those characteristics as an adult (even the propensity for getting into trouble, unfortunately). Anne\u2019s greatest gift is her imagination, and so is mine. I\u2019ve visited thousands of different worlds and time periods through that imagination, and it\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m the most thankful for. Anne adores Green Gables, the little farm where she comes to reside in Avonlea. She loves Matthew and Marilla, the siblings who take her in. Anne is one of the biggest nature nuts I\u2019ve ever come across, and I love how she renames things with more \u201cappropriate\u201d (in other words, more romantic) names, such as The Lake of Shining Waters instead of Barry\u2019s Pond. I can\u2019t express to you how very \u201cme\u201d that is! When I was a little girl, I was always naming parts of our land and pretending they were far away places. I have always been incredibly thankful to have been raised in the country, where my imagination could run wild every single day. I\u2019m thankful for spring flowers, summer fruit, rambunctious goats, and mockingbird song outside my window. I\u2019m thankful for summers in the pool and for wild thunderstorms as I go to sleep. I\u2019m thankful for the nearness of my family and the distance of the rest of the world. I\u2019m thankful for the freedom to take a long walk without worrying about my safety. And I see that same thankfulness in Anne Shirley. We are without a doubt kindred spirits, even if she is fictional. Another thing I have in common with Anne is a passion for stories, both the reading and the telling of them. I know of nothing else that can transport a person and allow them to live a thousand lives instead of only the life they\u2019ve been given. There is something magical about the ability of letters on a page to create something new in the minds of whoever reads them. Anne of Green Gables is no different. I felt completely at home in Avonlea, and I thoroughly enjoyed following Anne\u2019s adventures (and misadventures) through her late childhood. If I could reach into the world of fiction and adopt any literary orphan, Anne would be one of my top two picks alongside Harry Potter. I have to confess, though, I\u2019m pretty sure Anne would come out on top if I could only choose one. She\u2019s enchanting and lives life to the fullest, and she\u2019s a much better person than she believes herself to be. I love Anne with all of my heart, and I can\u2019t wait to share her with my niece. She\u2019s a character that I\u2019ll keep revisiting for the rest of my life, and I can\u2019t imagine ever tiring of her. Kindred spirits are hard to find, but I definitely found one in Anne of Green Gables.

Montgomery, written in 1902. I read this book nearly 30 years ago and had to refresh my memory a little, before writing the review. I'd forgotten it was part of a whole series. I read more than one, but not sure which other ones. I recall this first one... a tale about an orphan girl, acclimating to a new family, meeting friends and neighbors. On the outskirts, it's a coming-of-age tale about a young girl becoming a woman and learning about the realities of life. It's both a funny book to read and an educational one with some lessons. It's something every kid should read, just to understand how good they have it... or if they are adopted, to learn how to deal with it. Anne's a beautiful person, forgetting age for a few seconds. And whenever she's around, it sorta feels like the comforts of home. If you haven't sampled it, read one of the books in the series just to see what life was like for a girl like her over a century ago. It'll be a positive read, even so many years later.\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

All the beyond was hers with its possibilities lurking rosily in the oncoming years-each year a rose of promise to be woven into an immortal chaplet.\"Page 261 \"Anne was sitting at her open window, for the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the world, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with flower-breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stirs of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying down through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper in her hand.\"The descritions of nature cannot be beat...Page 147 \"Anne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy places. Afar in the southwest wwas the great shimmering, pearl-like sparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal rose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce.

Don\u2019t you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this? And I can hear the brook laughing all the way up here. Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are? They\u2019re always laughing. Even in winter-time I\u2019ve heard them under the ice. I\u2019m so glad there\u2019s a brook near Green Gables. Perhaps you think it doesn\u2019t make any difference to me when you\u2019re not going to keep me, but it does. I shall always like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if I never see it again. If there wasn\u2019t a brook I\u2019d be haunted by the uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one. I\u2019m not in the depths of despair this morning. I never can be in the morning. Isn\u2019t it a splendid thing that there are mornings? But I feel very sad. I\u2019ve just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was to stay here for ever and ever. It was a great comfort while it lasted. But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts.\u201dI swear this is a rare French edition of Anne of Green Gables:I jest, but Anne's motormouth gabbing at Green Gables almost unmanned me. Not only does she never shut up, the twee nonsense she was carping on and on about made me cringe so hard I thought I was going to morph into an accordion. Fiddlesticks indeed! I did consider dropping the book after a few pages of Anne\u2019s mind boggling loquaciousness but something about the book grabbed me when I wasn't looking. There is something rather compelling about the narrative which I could not quite put my finger on at that point, so I kept on reading. I am glad I did.This is going to make me sound terribly ignorant but I never heard of Anne of Green Gables until I read that Netflix was about to air a new adaptation of it. This piqued my interest because it is clearly not a kickass show like most of their recent series. Then I looked up the book on Librivox.org and I found that they have an audiobook of it, read by the excellent Karen Savage. That sealed the deal for me; it is free to read (or listen to) after all, there is no risk in giving it a shot.First published in 1908 Anne of Green Gables is about an orphan named Anne Shirley who is adopted by an old woman called Marilla Cuthbert and her brother Matthew. They wanted to adopt a boy to help Matthew with his farm work but through some kind of snafu, the orphanage sent them a girl instead. Marilla wants to send her back immediately but kindhearted Matt enjoys listening to Anne\u2019s crazy-ass chatter. Soon, however, Anne\u2019s peculiar charms begin to get under her skin and she changes her mind. So Anne gets to live with them at their Green Gables house in Avonlea, a little town on Prince Edward Island, Canada. Pastoral mayhem ensues.Anne and her BFF Diana, art by Kasia1989 It took longer with me than with Marilla but Anne eventually got under my skin too. In spite of being bloody irritating she is interesting and her \u201cjoie de vivre\u201d, fearlessness and optimism are infectious. I also enjoy the episodic scrapes she gets into over several chapters: almost breaking her neck, almost drowning, accidentally dyeing her hair green, breaking a slate over a boy's head etc. In George Elliott's lovely  Silas Marner Elliott mentions an \u201cunfolding of the soul\u201d that resonates with me, it describes the life-changing effect that the introduction of a child into your life has on your perspective, your attitude, your behavior, and your very soul. There is an identical process going on in Anne of Green Gables with the hitherto terse and practical Marilla. I love this theme and enjoyed reading about her gradual transformation. As for Anne\u2019s nonsensical chatter I become desensitized to it after a while and I was happy to let Anne be Anne. The timeline of the book also spans more years than I expected, I thought it was going to be about Anne getting into scrapes after scrapes until the book ends somehow, and that would have been alright with me. However, it turns out that the book depicts Anne\u2019s coming of age, her gradual development from the age of eleven to sixteen. By the end of the book, Anne is much more mature and not so manic.There is a lighthearted and warm tone to Lucy Maud Montgomery which is a pleasure to read. This is \u201ca book for all ages\u201d so it is not exactly challenging to read. The characterization is very well done. The central characters are all believable and even lovable. The book actually becomes quite poignant towards the end and I closed the book with a happy sigh. There are eight sequels to this book I doubt I will read them all but I would be quite happy to check in on Anne again before too long.Notes:\u2022 I am a fan of Ms. Karen Savage\u2019s audiobook narrations, she has such a pleasant reading voice. Her narration of Anne of Green Gables is her best yet. Her love for this book really comes through in her enthusiastic and passionate delivery. I am ever so grateful. (Download page).\u2022 Anne of Green Gables became so popular and such an important symbol of freedom in Poland that the Polish army issued a copy to every soldier before WWII.\u2022 Anne of Green Gables is a sort of Canadian  Secret Garden or  Silas Marner.\u2022 This book is not as widely read as I thought, my extremely well read BFF Cecily has never heard of it until this review, which probably means at least 50% of the world's reading population haven't. Have a look at the Netflix trailer, see if it's your thing (though there's more angst in the TV show than in the book).\u2022 Ten things Anne of Green Gables taught this Guardian journo. \u2022 Netflix\u2019s adaptation (called Anne with an \u201cE\u201d) has been described as \u201cgritty\u201d, the grits are of their own manufacture; there is about as much grit in Anne of Green Gables as you would find in an average glass of milk. Amybeth McNulty who plays Anne is a fantastic young actress, her portrayal of Anne is top notched. The show looks good but I have to say I don't like the additional dark materials they put in, I think it is tonally at odds with the spirit of the book. I have seen a couple of episodes so far and a fairly minor incident in the book is blown up into a huge melodrama with a galloping horse chasing a train! (See message #17 by Tracey below for more details. Thanks, Tracey! \ud83e\udd17)\n \u2022 It is called Anne with an \u201cE\u201d because that is her badass spelling of it, and she insists the E is always included even when people are vocalizing the name.\u2022 A minor complaint. Anne\u2019s acrimonious relationship with Gilbert Blythe (who she whacks on the head with a slate) goes on too long on too trivial a basis to be reasonable or believable. I mean, he calls her carrot once and that started five years of animosity? Quotes:\u201cThe long platform was almost deserted; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end. Matthew, barely noting that it was a girl, sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her. Had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression. She was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and, since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all her might and main.\u201d\u201cListen to the trees talking in their sleep,\u201d she whispered, as he lifted her to the ground. \u201cWhat nice dreams they must have!\u201d\u201cMatthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. But he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl. But this freckled witch was very different, and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes he thought that he \u201ckind of liked her chatter.\u201dBut they shouldn\u2019t call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning in a name like that. They should call it\u2014let me see\u2014the White Way of Delight. Isn\u2019t that a nice imaginative name? When I don\u2019t like the name of a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of them so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins, but I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that place the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight.Japanese book coverAnime"}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "I didn't think I'd like this book at first, but it turned out to be amazing!

This is a children's book, and so I was expecting a story with a lovely protagonist and some lovely and educating morals, and that's what I got. Anne is simply lovable from the very beginning where she's being fetched by Matthew on the train station to come live in Green Gables. She's highly enthousiastic about everything from the trees to the birds and the brook, and sometimes she was a bit too enthousiastic for my taste. Still, I loved her, because she was such a fierce and courageous little red-head at her age.I think that one thing about this book that appeals to children a lot is the fact that Anne has a vivid imagination. She can go on for pages about her thoughts and feelings while we, the readers, are waiting for the story to continue. I found those digressions very endearing, and they are definitely the reason why this children's book is actually over 400 pages long. The book turned into a narrative on Anne growing up, and each chapter became about a new episode in her life. That narrative style did become a bit too predictable for my taste, but in the end I still really liked this story because it warmed my heart and put a smile to my face."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30749549-samantha", "userReview": "Yup!

It's easy to get into but not one to fly through, plus I've been in a reading slump this month.Anne is a funny child - she's positive and hopeful and...talkative. It's impossible not to like her. As an adult reading this I understand Marilla because the child definitely was willful and up to getting into accidental mischief, although the beginning where they didn't want her because she was a 'useful boy' was just a shame of the times. I'm glad she was around to bring so much joy around to Avonlea, Marilla, Matthew and neighbors. When she amused them with her stories, she amused me at the same time.Each chapter is divided into an incident or event, which worked well for this type of the story. Montgomery's writing style is a delight, especially considering how old the book is. I can see why this classic has lasted through the ages. Through the afterword I found out how much it meant in particular countries for their hope after the war. Inspiring stuff.I can see why readers fall in love with Gilbert - I did myself (Carrots! Carrots!) This book works so well because it takes an unconventional girl filled with hope and wonder in the world, a girl who loves Octobers, nature, beauty, kindred spirits and friends. One loyal and ambitious and full of daydreams. I think this calls to something in all of us, a type of hopeful wonder that the world is always beautiful despite whatever wrenches are thrown in the way. This isn't the say Anne doesn't have a funny, frightful temper or that she doesn't hit with woes when warranted - actually she feels the intensity of lows as much as highs, making her a dramatic sort. This only makes her more endearing.I think the best part was the feelings she invoked in the practical and still Marilla and the shy and simple Matthew. A beautiful bonding of family tale.I haven't seen any movie or show adaptations of this one yet, but I somehow think the real beauty of the book can only come to life as its fullest in the written form."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Anne of Green Gables, L.M.

The red-headed orphan girl of 11 adopted by the middle-aged Cuthberts was quite the force of nature. Her power of imagination, romance, and language helped to melt their frozen hearts and properness of their childless, Calvinist household. She was not the farmworker they expected when they applied to the orphanage for a boy, but she brought them many gifts, such as the ability to laugh, appreciate play, and hope for the future. Some of the comic scenes were priceless for me, such as when she tried to dye away her red hair to solve the problem of teasing from her peers and ended up with green hair. Or when she accidentally served her new bosom friend Diana wine by mistake and got her drunk. We experience her dealing with many common moral issues of growing up, such as bullying, cliques, and unseemly emotions of jealousy, pride, and vindictiveness. Her stubborn grudge against Gilbert for making fun of her red hair lasts many years, despite his admiration and sincere apologies. Only when illness in the family makes her seek a teaching position in the village and Gilbert makes a sacrifice to allow that to happen does she come to realize her cruel mistake. It doesn\u2019t take much imagination to suspect a romance for them in successor volumes of the original book. Living up near the Canadian Maritimes in Maine, I have had tours of New Brunswick, Quebec, and Nova Scotia but have not had the pleasure of Prince Edward Island. Here I got a nice sense of rural life there at the turn of the 20th century and delights of the island geography, which helped keep modernism at bay for awhile. My one regret with the read is little sense of Anne\u2019s involvement with the hard work of running a farm. Despite certain tomboy ways, she seems to have been tracked into traditional girly ways of cooking, sewing, etc. Literature was her escape into imagination and the life of the mind, and her use of that pathway to become a teacher and nascent writer makes for her a wholesome model for young girls to this day."}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "\"Well now, she's a real interesting little thing,\" persisted Matthew.Truer words were never spoken when the whirlwind known as Anne Shirley comes to live with siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert at Green Gables.In one terrific example of cosmic trickery, the Cuthberts, who were hoping to adopt a boy to help out around the farm, are sent instead a garrulous and imaginative, red-headed girl. Matthew takes to her immediately. Marilla needs some convincing.\"Matthew Cuthbert, you don't mean to say you think we ought to keep her!\"Marilla's astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had expressed a predilection for standing on his head.\"Well now, no, I suppose not -- not exactly,\" stammered Matthew, uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. \"I suppose -- we could hardly be expected to keep her.\"\"I should say not. What good would she be to us?\"\"We might be some good to her,\" said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly.Poor Anne, who has spent her brief life in foster homes caring for the children of drunkards, or penned up in an orphan's asylum, is devastated.\"You don't want me!\" she cried. \"You don't want me because I'm not a boy!\"But, of course she gets to stay, and as Matthew predicts, they are indeed good for her. The surprising thing is how good she is for them. Anne's unbounded enthusiasm for the world around her is infectious, and before long, Marilla finds herself reminded of the young girl she once was.\"All sorts of mornings are interesting, don't you think? You don't know what's going to happen through the day, and there's so much scope for imagination.\"Imagine Anne's delight at seeing Prince Edward Island for the first time.If you ever need a reminder of how amazing the world can be, look no further than Montgomery and her plucky, indomitable heroine.Green GablesThis book is my comfort food - my grilled cheese with tomato soup, my hot chocolate on a cold winter's day, my cupcakes with sugary frosting.\"Dear old world,\" she murmured, \"you are very lovely, and I am glad to be alive in you.\""}, {"userName": "Alex Farrand", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37663070-alex-farrand", "userReview": "Alright, I liked it. It was a flat lined, static book, but Anne's personality made me like it. I thought this book was a cross between Little Women and the Little Princess. Little Women because there was no real climax to the book, but each chapter had it's lesson, but not as long and I didn't skim the last chapter. Little Princess because of her wild imagination to create stories. Then you add a character who has some flaws, red hair, and loves to talk in the mix and you have Anne of Green Gables. I was more interested in Gilbert and Anne's relationship. That is going to happen. *wink, wink* There were a few funny moments throughout the book. I might read the rest of the series.

I knew I'd read it someday but it wasn't a top priority at all. I had to read this for my can lit course this semester and boy am I ever glad for that. I absolutely adored this story. Anne is such a darling and she just makes me look at the world differently and want to use my imagination more, she makes me feel like a kid again. I loved all the characters and the writing was fantastic. The ending just made me want to read the rest of the series!

Yes, I know, it's an unforgivable crime that I haven't read this book/series until now but maybe this was the perfect timing after all.

Her pointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.\u201cYou\u2019re only Anne of Green Gables,\u201d she said earnestly, \u201cand I see you, just as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine I\u2019m the Lady Cordelia. But it\u2019s a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than Anne of nowhere in particular, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nI'm so overjoyed to have finally read this. I've set my mind on reading more classics from now on, and I'll definitely see it done. I'll be moving slowly, I don't see myself going on a classic book binge anytime soon but I plan to have a proper count of read classics sooner than soon, little by little I'll build that shelf up.\nStory time...\nThe name on my first birth certificate wasn't Anne, my parents named me Ann - and you'd think, \"what's the difference?\" Oh, but there is one - and I hated it. Just like Anne Shirley of Green Gables who said, \"Anne is such an unromantic name\" and thought that Ann was an even worse name than Anne, I too thought both names were terribly unromantic: Stiff, non-lyrical and final sounding. But I felt the latter was more forgiving than the former.In a moment of sheer foolishness, during my national exam(which all seniors have to take and pass in order to graduate from high school in my country), I put down my name as \nAnne\n and not \nAnn\n on all my papers in all the subjects I took. That was a very bad decision, I was 15 and so I was very accountable for my actions. The name on my result which came out months later didn't match the name on my birth certificate - and every other record of mine. I never realized until that moment how important identities are and how little things can make a big difference. I couldn't use my result to register for university, or use it at all because there were doubts pertaining to my claim as the owner of my result. All because of that small detail; \nabsence of one silly letter 'e'.\n My father had to go to court and swear an affidavit of identify in my stead. And I was given a new birth certificate with my present name, Anne. I swear if I were my parents, I would have killed me. Bless my father for his patience. Though I do know I was no angel, I want to believe growing up Anne Shirley is an orphaned girl who is adopted by the elderly Cuthberts living at Green Gables in need of a handy-boy to help with domestic and field work. Needless to say, her adoption was a mistake, because obviously Anne is not a boy. Somehow Anne's charm and potential doesn't leave the pair unaffected, so they decide to keep her. And thus begins the tale of Anne of Green Gables.Anne reminds me so much of myself. It's absolutely no surprise that I identified with her so much, it's very possible I fastened onto her character so passionately because of our shared name. I can't even count how many times I went- \"That's what I said!\" everytime she said something that resembled thoughts I'd once had or words I'd once spoken. I don't know...at this moment I just feel glad for my moment of foolishness that earned me the name Anne.  I feel glad about the existence of this book.Even if I had to peel the personal off this review, the facts would still remain; Anne is a divine and sound model character who is easily loved. Her relationship with those around her, and her radiant effect on them was such a pleasant thing to read. I was so thankful with her for her loving adopters who took it upon themselves to raise her right and iron out her kinks, but also appreciate and commend the good in her. I was grateful for every kindred spirit  she encountered along the way. \nA letter to the girl whose name I share\n\nDear Anne,You are such a dear character with a resonating story. So animated and full of life, I swear I could almost feel all your emotions rolling off the pages of the book, I imagined I could reach out, grab and bottle them all up. All your emotions and thoughts, your very fertile imagination and highly opinionated thoughts. I don't think it's possible to read about a character as talkative and affective as you. I wish I had met you when I was younger and fallen in love with you just as I have now. You're the epitome of childlike wonder and you remind me(and lots of girls around the world) of the beauty of innocence and starry-eyed wondering world of a child; of what it felt like to imagine up all the most insane and ridiculous things from the depths of my mind and be content and pleased at my own capacity; of memories of mischief and caprice which are given to childhood days, because to be a child means to make blunders and be rigorous, hopeful and full of dreams. You remind me of what it feels like to be amazed at the capacity of the world in itself. I hope people continue to read about you, I hope you continue to inspire and comfort many as the times change. As for me, I take the best of you you give, and the rest, those too I'll endeavour to keep - meaning all of you. Thank you for words like these; \"Dear old world,\" she murmured, \"you are very lovely and I am glad to be alive in you.\"Yours fondly,Anne."}], "description": "Everyone's favorite redhead, the spunky Anne Shirley, begins her adventures at Green Gables, a farm outside Avonlea, Prince Edward Island.
