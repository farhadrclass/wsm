Dorothy looked at me and looked at me and she really thought my brains were a miracle. I mean she said my brains reminded her of a radio because you listen to it for days and days and you get discouraged and just when you are getting ready to smash it, something comes out that is a masterpiece.\u201d\nBeauty can be born just about anywhere. It can appear in blue stocking families, or come from hard working blue collar families, or it can even occur in a trailer trash family from Little Rock, Arkansas. Genetics are puzzling and unpredictable, sometimes giving unattractive kids to attractive parents or cherubs to parents who are mystified how symmetrical features ever found their way into their family tree. Lorelei Lee from Little Rock is one of those mysteries of nature. She is pretty, but not just pretty, she is a vava voom beauty. And as Dorothy says in the quote at the beginning of this review, Lorelei Lee has an unusual mind, a brain that on the surface seems as vibrant as a bag of hammers, but as I read her diary, the more I start to understand that she has a single minded purpose. People who are able to focus all their brain power on one desire become very cunning in the narrow focus of achieving their goal. \nDorothy, played so well by Jane Russell in the movie, is attracted to a different sort of man than Lorelei.When I was going to college, I experienced frequent bouts of poverty, not Grapes of Wrath poverty, but I certainly had many moments where all the money I had in the world was jingling in my pocket...and not very loudly. I decided that I was going to do what I could to never be poor again. I didn\u2019t have my Scarlett moment: \u201dAs God is my witness, as God is my witness they're not going to lick me. I'm going to live through this and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again. No, nor any of my folk. If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill. As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again.\u201d I decided to go with more of a solemn oath to myself and left God out of it. He, after all, left me a world of plenty. It was my job to figure out how to get my fair share. Lorelei takes a different path to security than I did.Lorelei Lee is mercenary in the ways of love. She doesn\u2019t see the sense in her friend Dorothy hanging out with tennis champions \u201dor going around with gentlemen who do not have anything.\u201d After all, isn\u2019t it as easy to love a man with money as it is to love a man with none? \u201d...because kissing your hand may make you feel very very good but a diamond and safire bracelet lasts forever.\u201dThis is expanded upon in the movie in the song written by Gordon Martin that Marilyn Monroe sings. \u201dA kiss on the hand may be quite continental, / But diamonds are a girl's best friend. / A kiss may be grand, but it won't pay the rental on your humble flat. / Or help you at the automat. / Men grow cold as girls grow old, and we all lose our charm in the end. / But square-cut or pear-shaped, these rocks won't lost their shape. / Diamonds are a girl's best friend.\u201dI bring up Marilyn Monroe because it is impossible to read this book without hearing her sultry, soft voice in my ear. Anita Loos, the author of this book, also worked on the screenplay for the movie by the same name. While researching this book, I learned just enough about Loos to realize that I need to discover more about her. She was a jack of all trades and successful at all of them. She wrote books, screenplays, and even acted in films. Recently, I watched San Francisco (1936) starring Clark Gable and Jeanette MacDonald without ever really putting together the fact that Anita Loos wrote the screenplay. When she finished writing this book, she took it to her friends and acquaintances who laughed, but at the same time felt the book was too scandalous, after all she was making fun of sex. They suggested that she serialize the book in Harper\u2019s Bazaar, where it would be lost among the ads. Subscriptions to HB tripled. When the story was published in book form the first edition sold out in two weeks. Reporters liked Anita Loos because she was always good for an off color quote. In this case, she shared some wisdom regarding women\u2019s lib. \u201dThey keep getting up on soap boxes and proclaiming that women are brighter than men. That\u2019s true, but it should be kept very quiet or it ruins the whole racket.\u201dLorelei Lee, at the suggestion of one of her rich male friends, is sent to Europe on a tour to improve her mind... on his dime of course. This doesn\u2019t keep her from weighing the men of Europe to see if any of them are a better catch than the one she has. If you have seen the movie, then you are familiar with Piggie. He shows up in the book but is woefully in need of some training. \u201dBecause I always think that spending money is only just a habit and if you get a gentleman started on buying one dozen orchids at a time he really gets very good habits.\u201d The matter of a diamond tiara gets Piggie in all kinds of trouble. I don\u2019t think he has ever had so much fun getting in hot water in his whole life. \nIllustration of Piggie by Ffolkes from the Folio EditionBy chance, the movie Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) came on the other night. I put it on intending to watch just a few scenes, but ended up watching the entire movie again. It is that kind of movie. This time I payed close attention to Marilyn Monroe (as if anyone can take their eyes of her when she is on screen) because I\u2019d been spending time with the literary Lorelei Lee. Monroe\u2019s performance is really extraordinary. What she does may look easy, but the ease with which she portrays the role, like a second skin, is really impressive. In my opinion, she should have at least received an Oscar nod. Jane Russell does a wonderful job playing the second best looking girl in the room. If you haven\u2019t seen the movie, please put it on your list. It is truly a marvel to behold. \nAnita Loos, beautiful and smart, and very not blonde.I laughed many times while reading this book. The humor pounces unexpectedly. Lorelei will say something that sounds perfectly normal; but then, when your brain has a chance to break down what she said into parts, you start to realize that she snuck a Lorelei-ism that shouldn\u2019t make sense. \u201dAnd so I really think that I can say good-bye to my diary feeling that, after all, everything always turns out for the best.\u201dI never doubted that Lorelei would get what she wanted. She says it best: \u201cI can be smart when it is important.\u201dIf you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "March 5thToday I went to a place called Goodreads, it is a kind of litrary salo which is useful for a girl that wants to improve her mind like I do. So I wondered how I would be a social success there it is quite different from New York but luckily I met a gentleman called Mr. Paul Bryant who took an interest in me and wanted to help me improve my mind. Mr. Bryant said it is very very easy you just post a review that is a bit riskay and has an artistic picture at the top. I said I did not know how to do artistic pictures but Mr. Bryant said you just borrow one from another review like from Miss Lisa Jayne who is very very popular. I said isnt that stealing but Mr. Bryant said no it is an act of ommadge and she will be delighted.Then I said what do I write under the picture and he said you just be yourself and you will see the votes come rolling in, like I said it is very very easy. So I copied out what I wrote in my diary for today and Mr. Bryant gave it to his friend Dr. Rayner to post and they said I would be an Internet celebrity before I knew it. I said that was very very interesting but was there a place on the Internet where they could buy me an emerald bracelet since a girl doesn't want to waste her time. But Mr. Bryant said that unfortunately he was to busy today to go shopping.I like the Internet very very much but I think I will go back to New York because the gentlemen there know how to treat a lady."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "Here is what Edith Wharton called the Great American Novel, and when it showed up on the Guardian's Top 100 English Novels list it was suggested that perhaps she was being sarcastic. But when one nominates the Great American Novel, one is defining America at least as much as the Novel, yes? And I'm going to venture to suggest that it may not have been the Novel that Wharton was feeling sarcastic about.There's a straight line between Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' Lorelei and Marilyn Monroe and Madonna, just as there's a line between Dorothy Parker and Sylvia Plath and Lena Dunham, and you can see why Dorothy Parker found it necessary to rebut this book with her short story Big Blonde; these are different archetypes here, and they don't go to the same parties. But Lorelei is an archetype, one of the great characters, an American Becky Sharp, and this book makes an impact, despite its often preposterous plot. (You know where else Freud makes a personal appearance is Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.) Anita Loos (her real name, surprisingly, not a dirty joke you didn't get) knows exactly what she's doing. Lorelei's ditzily unreliable narration packs a ton of information in between its lines. And it's funny. Like, super funny: one of the funniest books I've ever read.I'm writing this on Thanksgiving, and the news today is filled with breathless anticipation of tomorrow, which we call Black Friday because people are most likely going to actually die in pursuit of discounts and yes, sure: Lorelei is the Great American Hero we deserve."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "Anita Loos (1889-1981) was a successful playwright, screenwriter, and novelist, but she is best known for her best selling book, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Loos released her novel in a period when some of the great American authors were writing books like The Great Gatsby, The Sun Also Rises, Main Street, and The Age of Innocence, whose author Edith Wharton referred to Gentlemen Prefer Blondes as \"the great American novel\". There may have been a little sarcasm in that, but I think she was impressed with what Loos accomplished. And having lived in NewYork and Paris, she probably got a laugh out of Lorelei's escapades through those cities.Don't be mislead into thinking this is a shallow book, pandering to a sex crazy, Jazz Age, male audience. No, Anita Loos aims a little higher than that, with a parody of the female stereotypes created by the Hollywood film industry of the 1920s. And along the way she creates Lorelei Lee from Little Rock Arkansas, one of the truly iconic characters in 20th century American literature. Her character was later immortalized by Marylyn Monroe in the film by the same name. While I got a laugh out of the story and characters, along the way I may have learned something about human nature and single minded determination."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Driving to school to pick up Georgia only 45 minutes ago!

L. Mencken, who had a weakness for blondes.The narrator of this volume, Lorelei Lee, is a formidable member of the species. She\u2019s a dumb blonde who is not so dumb after all. She is in fact remarkably single-minded. Lorelei collects men the way some people collect stamps, and like a keen philatelist she is a discriminating collector. They have to be rich. They also have to be willing to part with their money, but that\u2019s no problem. All men suddenly become willing to part with their money when they meet Lorelei.Lorelei hails from Little Rock Arkansas. She left that metropolis after an unfortunate incident with a male admirer. He was a little too ardent in his pursuit, Lorelei found herself holding a revolver, and as she puts it, the revolver shot her admirer. This could have caused her some inconvenience, but luckily the judge and the gentlemen of the jury were all very sweet about it.Now Lorelei has been sent to Europe by another admirer to educate herself. Lorelei\u2019s ideas on gaining an education centre mainly on shopping, a subject on which she is an expert. She gains fresh admirers wherever she goes. There is some difficulty over a diamond tiara presented to her by one particularly keen admirer, the unpleasantness being caused by his wife who unaccountably raises objections about this little bauble. The lady despatches a father-and-son team of French lawyers to retrieve the gift, but luckily the two lawyers, once they meet Lorelei, are really sweet about the whole matter. So sweet that they spend a great deal of their client\u2019s money taking Lorelei shopping.Lorelei is accompanied on her adventures by her friend Dorothy. Dorothy has some odd ideas about men. She fall in love with them. Lorelei has nothing against love but she considers it eccentric to fall in love with men who are not rich. Love doesn\u2019t always last, but diamonds are forever.Lorelei\u2019s latest conquest is an American philanthropist who shares her interest in motion pictures, but while Lorelei hopes to act in movies his passion is for censoring them. He is very concerned by the moral depravity of Hollywood. So concerned that he is willing to expose himself to the dangers of viewing the most risque scenes over and over again. This is a wickedly funny little book. You don\u2019t expect a light-hearted romp about flappers on the make to have a recommendation from James Joyce on the cover but Joyce was a huge fan of this book."}, {"userName": "Karen Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1218556-karen-beth", "userReview": "I have never laughed so many times in one sitting in my entire lifetime of reading than I did with this book.

Outrageous, illiterate, but utterly self-assured, Lorelei is the essence of a Roaring Twenties gold digger. Her motto has become an advertising icon: \u2018Kissing your hand may make you feel very good, but a diamond bracelet lasts forever\u2019. She records this and her other pens\u00e9es \u2013 \u2018I seem to be thinking practically all of the time.\u2019 \u2013 in a diary of airy confessions that could have made Ovid blush.\u2002\u2003Anita Loos\u2019 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady (1925) began as a series of short sketches printed in Harper\u2019s Bazaar. Loos found her inspiration one day as she watched a bombshell blonde turn the iron man of American letters, H. L. Mencken, into a jiggly lump of jelly. Like Mencken, the men in Loos\u2019 novel \u2013 Gus Eisman the Button King, Sir \u2018Piggie\u2019 Beekman, Louie and Robber (a father & son team of Parisian avocats), the Prince of Wales, and even Sigmund \u2018Froyd\u2019 \u2013 don\u2019t stand a chance against Lorelei, whose charming antics open wallets and set loose an amaranthine stream of champagne, orchids, diamonds. After all, \u2018A girl with brains ought to do something else with them besides think\u2019.\u2002\u2003For all of its fun, the book takes a little bit of patience. After three chapters of tripping over Lorelei\u2019s curious but unvarying cant, I was just about to chuck it. But then I bumped into a masterpiece, and the masterpiece was Paris. It took Loos 90 pages to get warmed up, but here at last she begins writing a book with a story as enchanting as her characters. After Paris you can count on another 100 pages of tittering delight. When Lorelei\u2019s chatter gets to be a little too grating, her traveling companion Dorothy will let fly one of her zingers (some of the best lines in the book) that resurrects the humor and spurs on your reading.

I think that takes a bit of the fun from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes for me.

But this follows the noble tradition of such books as Shamela, and it is very, very funny.

Finally, on the eve of Lorelei's impending nuptuals to a Main Line Aristocrat, she and her pal Dorothy (Jane Russell) decide that Lorelei deserves a coming out party -- catered by Joe Sanguinetti of the Silver Spray Social Club of Brooklyn.Lots of smart satire in the guise of stupidity."}, {"userName": "verbava", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2219641-verbava", "userReview": "\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0439 \u0456\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0430, \u0434\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0437-\u0456-\u0432\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0443 \u0456\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u044f, \u0442\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0456 \u0434\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0437\u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u2013 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043b\u0456, \u0431\u0456\u043b\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0430, \u0447\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c \u044f\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u0432\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439 \u0442\u044f\u0436\u043a\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u044f \u0447\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0456\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0456\u0437 \u043e\u0447\u0438\u043c\u0430. \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0438, \u0449\u043e \u0447\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0456\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0456\u0437 \u0432\u0443\u0445\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0445\u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0456, \u0431\u043e \u043b\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u2013 \u043f\u0430\u043d\u044f\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0456 \u043d\u0430\u0457\u0432\u043d\u0430, \u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0454\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435, \u0449\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0456\u0442\u044c, \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435, \u0456\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0456 \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0447\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0456\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0434\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0431\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0443\u0454.\u0434\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0447\u0456, \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0457\u0432\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c: \u044f\u043a \u0432\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044f \u0457\u0457 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430, \u043c\u043e\u0437\u043e\u043a \u043b\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0454 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0456\u043e, \u044f\u043a\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0445\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0456 \u044f\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0454, \u0430\u043b\u0435 \u044f\u043a \u0442\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0440\u0456\u0448\u0443\u0454\u0448 \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438, \u0432\u043e\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0454 \u044f\u043a\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044c \u0448\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440. \u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0457\u043d\u044e \u044f\u043a \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u0434\u0443\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0443 \u2013 \u0432 \u0446\u0456\u0439 \u0431\u0456\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0456\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0456 \u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0454\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0447\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0456\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043a.
