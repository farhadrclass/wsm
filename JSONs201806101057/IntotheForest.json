I almost gave it 4 vs. 5 stars though, because I \u201cdidn\u2019t like\u201d the end. But, I realize, it\u2019s not that I thought the end was poorly done; it was just difficult for me to agree with aspects of the decisions made. The fact that certain happenings were so painful for me, shows how powerful this book seemed to me. This is a beautifully told story about 2 sisters who must fend for themselves in a world where civilization has broken down. Suspenseful and heartwarming.

After reading The Omnivores Dilemma just a couple months ago, it was hard not to scoff at, say, the pig-hunting episode, or the \"I'm gonna teach myself how to shoot a rifle today!\" episode, or the ease with which the girls begin identifying edible plants in their yard with nothing but the help of a poorly illustrated field guide. But the real death knell for me were the feminist themes that start as subtle overtones and evolve into heavy-handed garbledygoop. (\"She wondered what was worse: a bear or a man.\" Ugh.) This is particularly frustrating because, in order to imagine her feminist pagan utopia, Hegland feels the need to \"evolve\" the sisters along traditional gender lines, with one receding into the standard female role while the other 'rises' to the occasion to become the provider, hunter, problem solver.Margaret Atwood she ain't."}, {"userName": "Mariel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel", "userReview": "Into the Forest was a random book find. I picked it off the shelves and decided it sounded like something my sister would like. Two young sisters hiding from the rest of their post apocolyptic world that is rapidly become further rings of apocolyptic mess, learning to survive and make a new world out of the old. I, um, pretty much talked her into buying a book that I kinda wanted to read. (I'm sneaky that way.) Lauren devoured it in one sitting. I did the same, but in my case it turned into more wanting to get it over with so I can start another book if and when they finally arrive in the mail. We had one of our long book talks about something one of us has read. I love those talks. She told me most of it (it would be churlish of me to complain. My spoilage ratio is infinitely higher than hers. I could move to L.A., start a detective agency, and still never make up for the book souls I have stolen from her). I wish I had stuck with her retelling than reading it because now I'm feeling disturbed and restless. Kinda pissed off. Laur, we are going to have some more words. (Don't you just hate Eva? She's a pod person!) By the way, the book jacket liessssssss. They don't create anything. Eva lives in her self-obsessed dreams of ballet. She would doubtlessly have perished without her sister to take care of her (ahem hover in an annoyingly well meaning kinda way in fruitless hopes it would ever be reciprocated). Nell talks the talk about wanting companionship, holding the torch of all the ideas that came before (when the world was a world of more than the two of them). She just wants to own facts, I think, like those encyclopedia entries she attempts to memorize, or her sister's time. The only walk she'd do is two giant steps behind Eva. The apocolypse is neither here nor there. The girls live in the forest. It's rare that it touches their fringes. Their hell is the waiting room variety. Worrying where your next meal is going to come from (Nell) and no dreams (Eva). When the worrying becomes action a new worry about not being needed enough takes its place. Eva dances without music. It's a pointlessly feverish dream like if someone lost their legs and can still feel them. What the hell is she expressing anyway? She wants to be great, but c'mon it isn't going to happen. There is no one to see her dance. She has no emotions to express, other than her own desire to be \"great\". She may as well wear a wedding dress or put on outfits for parties she's never going to go to. I felt that Hegland tried to hard with the rotten dreams of Eva. Being \"great\" doesn't really mean anything. Sure, I could write here right now that I performed an awesome John Lennon frog legs dance. If you can't see me doing it what does it matter? Applause, please! I could write about some story I plan to write that no one will ever read, as Nell does, that doesn't even do anything for me. Pity, please! Eye rolls. Nell has been desirous of a life and company before there was an unnamed apocolypse (this is like The Road misery. The hows and whys don't come into it). Life with the fam was always like how it must be for a dog. It's cute when people want it and then it's a pat on the head and on your way when they have other things to do. Maybe dress up time in cute outfits when an ego needs to be stroked (pets who look like their owners pageant day?). The shit was shit before the shit went down. I'm disturbed that Nell NEVER gets past this dog wagging. Look, I brought you your slippers! Please notice me! The mom says \"You're your own person\" repeatedly. They should have let her go to school and be around other kids. It wasn't fair to keep the dog - whoops, I mean girl- in their wings in case they wanted her around. The point of the book was kinda bullshit because in the end Nell is still just collecting facts and cowtowing to her sister. How is that creating anything? It's the meaninglessness of Eva's dancing. What exactly is it expressing? Some pretty vague concepts about what ifs the luxuries were over. But these are PEOPLE in the story not what ifs. Food does change as it is spoiling... Eva has a baby after she is raped. She just doesn't want Nell to have anything to do with him. Nell wants to have a claim on someone and gives. They take and that's that. Someone on amazon wrote that they grow up and finally leave the house they lived in. They burn it out of fear of the rapist returning. It had nothing to do with growing up. Nell still goes with Eva into the forest where she'll continue to take care of the person who would never care enough to set the boundaries in the first place. Ugh. A book about enablers? Eva's addiction would be herself. Jean Hegland and I are going to have words. \"You're your own person\" my ass. Nell never learned any such thing. Writing that and it being true are not the same thing. None of the above would have been a detriment if \"You're your own person\" wasn't written so many damned times. They lived outside every day life, right? But their own needs became the routine, the every day life. You don't get to call no society forever. Nell had the chance to BE her own person, away from Eva, and she did not take it. She stays in the same spot. Not her own person. Bullshit ending. Maybe I'll go through my (um my sister's) copy with a highlighter and scratch out every time \"You're your own person\" is written. P.s. Lauren gave this five stars even though she didn't agree with the ending. I knew the ending was coming because she told me. That threw the whole other book in a light that it was not going to be going anywhere than where it already was. Why did I read it then? I don't know. I was hoping the rottenness was gonna be the fascinating kind, I guess. The kind that takes on other rotten shapes."}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "*4.25/5*THIS BOOK WAS SO GREAT. The writing was so beautiful and the descriptions were gorgeous and haunting and made the characters and images leap off the page. My only issue was the way the story was told: through journal entries that Nell wrote. I feel like if the story had been told in third person it would have given a more complete picture of what the two sisters went through, and would be more realistic than Nell constantly writing in a journal despite all of the other things keeping her busy. Other than that, I was obsessed with this book, and I think anybody looking to read a really realistic apocalypse story should give this a try. ALSO THE MOVIE IS SO GOOD.

Its a scary portrayal of the breakdown of America...and the story of a family that lives out in the middle of nowhere, right on the edge of a forest. They end up having to survive on some canned food they harvested from their garden. The dystopian aspect of the story is captivating, horrifying, and poignant. Basically...it half scared the crap out of me, and half made me want to dance around my house hugging everything from my clean socks to the light switches.Then, the characters take over the book, and it is downhill from there. The only character I liked was the father, because he was hilarious. Once he died, I wasn't a huge fan of the story. The two sisters never grew on me, and...I don't know. Their personalities were both just WEIRD. I imagine that the way they acted would probably be somewhat realistic if you really did lose all the things we take for granted, but still...they just didn't captivate me like the background of the story did. Especially when they \"made love.\" (Sorry for the spoiler, but I sure wish someone had warned me about it.)So the portrayal of a dystopian America gets 5 stars...and the characters get nil.

Eventually all utilities shut down completely, and without electricity and gas, there is no real news\u2014-just rumors. Stores quickly empty, and desperation and fear set in. The story focuses on two teenage girls who live about 30 miles from the nearest town in the northern redwood forest of CA. The deaths of their parents leave them completely dependent on each other. At first they sit cozily by the fire, carefully rationing their food, taking an inventory of everything in the house, and waiting for things to return to normal. Even as they begin to grow and preserve their own food, and then develop more aggressive survival skills, they watch their resources dwindle. How incredible to make a decision about when to use the last aspirin or how to use the last can of gas. Or to savor a single Hershey's Kiss, knowing that it may be the last chocolate you will ever taste in your life. It's hard to read this book without feeling like an unappreciative squanderer. This is an amazing story about survival against all odds and about the gifts of nature, and finally about a much-tested love between sisters.

In that frame of time, I had imagined this idea in my head of a book filled with controversy and chaos. The reality of what this book was never crossed paths with what I had imagined. It was far better.This story takes place in a post-apocalyptic time but it is not a post-apocalyptic book. This story features an act of incest (very brief - blink and you'll miss it) but it is not a book featuring an incestuous relationship. For everything that I thought Into the Forest would be, I realized that I was wrong. Very rarely am I glad to be wrong. If the last book I'd read was bright lights and noise, then this book would surely be dark and quiet. Make no mistake though. Quiet can be beautiful.The beauty was in the details. Heavy world building was not needed, for our characters lived in a world of solitude, away from the rest of a population in ruin. Survival and perseverance were the core values at the center of this world. If reading about day-to-day existence would not interest you, then this might not be a book you'd appreciate, which is fine. For me, I devoured this story in almost one sitting. As a child, I loved the Little House books. My favorites being Little House in the Big Woods and The Long Winter, the common thread between those two stories being the elements of day-to-day survival and finding the means to care for oneself with limited resources. I also had fascination with Claire's use of plants for medicinal purposes in the book Outlander, which is also a part of what happens in this particular tale.For the two sisters of Into the Forest, the journey was rough. They leaned on one another to make it through. As of now, their future is wide open. I did not mind the open ending but I'm not sure if I would have made the same decision that they did. I guess it's good that I'm not trying to survive out in a world where every man fends for themselves.This book was beautifully written in the form of one long and personal reflection. There are no chapter breaks but I didn't seem to mind that. The first few sections did have a bit more \"retelling\" than I cared to know about but the last half of the book was enthralling. Even though I know that this type of story won't be for everyone, I'm so glad that I took the time.

Their contact with the outside world is sporadic, so it takes them a while to realize that civilization is crumbling around them. Hegland is vague about the reasons--a far-off war, new strains of disease, terrorist attacks on US soil. (She wrote this in 1996, when all of this was less hackneyed.) But after a few seasons of this, the family is left without electricity, internet, telephones, mail, or gas. They are stranded in the woods, with nothing and no one to rely upon but themselves. It sounds much more interesting than it is. The story is told through Nell's POV, and it would be hard to craft a generic character. Her sister Eve has a bit more personality, but that personality is so broadly drawn that it's hard to give much credit. Although the girls are alone with each other for most of the story, their relationship has only the trappings of intimacy, and none of the depth of it. This book has all the emotional intensity of a school essay--and reads like one, too.OK, so the characters and emotional life are a bit lacking--surely their methods of survival would make up for it? Alas, no. Hegland is as vague about how to can or make acorn flour as she is on the intricacies of the girls' relationship. It's all very thinly sketched. If you want to read about surviving amidst the ruins of Western civilization, I'd recommend reading how i live now or Parable of the Sower, or heck, even Hatchet before bothering with this. It's not a bad book--but it's not a good one."}, {"userName": "H Dodge", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3010318-h-dodge", "userReview": "Spoilers ahead!I didn't like this book, I'll just get that out of the way. I had to read it for a class on the Apocalypse in American Literature, which was probably one of my favorite classes that I've taken thus far in college. After hearing about the basic themes of the book, essentially 2 sisters in the middle of nowhere trying to survive after some sort of war or peak oil situation (it's never clear what's going on exactly) essentially shuts down civilization as we know it, I was expecting to like it. I was hoping to like it. I was wrong. While I can appreciate what the author was trying to accomplish, setting a (post)apocalyptic story in a place far away from society, as opposed to in the middle of a city where the end of civilization is much more obvious, it was handled clumsily. The prose, while it does have a few good lines, is for the most part overwrought and sometimes even seems full of itself. While I can understand that the story is supposed to be the journal of a booksmart 17-18 year old, it was hard to stand it for an entire novel. The way that the sisters are able to suddenly discover and develop wilderness survival skills on their own with nothing but the help of a dry plant identification book is just silly, and the ending, where they decide to burn their (admittedly already falling apart) house down and go live in the woods is hopelessly immature and doesn't seem to be that well thought out considering the rest of the book is trying to subvert the kind of hopelessly optimistic fairy tale narrative that it turns into.The book is marketed as having some sort of amazing, touching relationship between the sisters. Yeah well, no. Not at all. One sister spends pretty much the entire novel practicing ballet off by herself while the other, the narrator, does almost nothing but read the encyclopedia and occasionally harvest plants. As far as I remember the only time they really bond is when they decide to split one of their last bottles of alcohol and get drunk together. Oh, wait, and then there's the sex scene. Basically, after the ballet dancing sister gets raped by a plot device that never really shows up again, she's understandably disturbed and shellshocked for a while. And apparently the best way to get over rape is to have incestuous lesbian sex. Granted, the scene isn't graphic at all, it's pretty much limited to one line, something like \"And then we made love, my sister and I.\" I don't have a problem with the lesbianism or the incest, I mean hell, it's a NOVEL. But it's just such a random event. It's never even really mentioned again after it happens and overall it just really doesn't make any sense.I could go on, nitpicking this book to death, but I think just covering some of the main problems it has is more than enough."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4756329-angie", "userReview": "I am a fan of apocalyptic fiction, and this one started out ok; unfortunately, it ended really poorly. I liked the fact that the sisters were isolated. And I actually think there reactions to the end of the world as they know it is probably how a lot of people would react - with a bit a denial and an unreasonable hope that things will get better soon.I found the characters pretty unlikeable however. Both Eve and Nell were naive and ignorant in their own ways. This made them fairly true to life but not really that interesting to read about. Nell, the heroine of the story, was of course the more interesting one, but even she had her moments. Their constant bickering and jealousy of each other quickly became repetitive and tedious.The first half of the book is pretty slow. It does pick up once they come to grips with their situation a little better, but there are some definite strange parts that could have been left out. I was actually pretty accepting of the book until the very end. I didn't like the book as a whole but I didn't completely dislike up until that point. However, the ending for me ruined the entire thing. Without giving anything major away, the sisters make a decision, which I actually think was the right one for them but they do it is such a spontaneous and poorly planned way that I think dooms them and I can't imagine why they would go about it they way they do. It just ruins all the hard work they just did. Too me it didn't make sense and in a world all about survival it seemed wrong.This definitely could have been better.

Over 30 miles from the nearest town, Nell and Eva struggle to survive as society begins to decay and collapse around them. No single event precedes society's fall. There is talk of a war overseas and upheaval in Congress, but it still comes as a shock when the electricity turns off and gas is nowhere to be found. The sisters consume the resources left in the house, waiting for the power to return. Their arrival into adulthood, however, forces them to reexamine their place in the world and their relationship to the land and each other.This book starts out in present day 1998, where Nell has found a notebook to write in. The book is told from her perspective and although there are sometimes dividers between paragraphs, there are no chapters. Nell tells the backstory to how they got to the point of being orphans in their home in the woods with no electricity or running water by telling brief background stories. Fair warning, there is really no action in this book and it is very slow paced. After about 50 pages, Nell has explained their background of living in the woods, what has happened to their parents and how their life was before the power went off and the grid basically collapsed. Then we watch as the sisters try to figure out how to survive when most of their resources are gone and how to maintain their relationship when other people come into the picture or when conflict arises.I love post-apocalyptic books but this is much different from any I have read in the past. As I said, the pace is very slow and there really isn't much action. A lot of the book is just the sisters lives day to day learning to survive and live with each other. The reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5 stars, is a couple of different things. First, the beginning is very, very slow and I imagine a lot of people would simply put the book down and stop reading. Second, there is a brief moment of incest later in the book that just really didn't need to happen. And the relationship and events that occur towards the end of the book just get a little uncomfortable or at least they did for me. I did however, really like the ending of the book and thought it was not only good closure for the book but that Nell and Eva also finally figured out their relationship as sisters. Overall, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it for anyone who is a fan of dystopian or post-apoplectic books, just don't expect much to happen for at least the first 50 pages, but just try and be patient.

There is no omniscient being to fill you in, and even the information they receive from outside sources is conflicting. You're stuck with only the knowledge they have, and you are scraping for survival information right along with them. Reading numerous favorable reviews I see that many people didn't like the way this story wrapped up, but I had no problem with it. The ending is neither happy nor sad. It's just an ending, as impartial as the forest they inhabit.Jean Hegland's prose is unforgettable. This book had me questioning and criticizing my reliance on everyday items like gasoline, electricity, the Internet, and air conditioning. I cringed at just how dependent we all are on today's technology. I felt ashamed of my consumer habits and wasteful, gluttonous nature. Before reading this book I considered myself only moderately materialistic, but during my reading I had the frightening realization that I am just as spoiled as the next human. Therefore this book was a wake-up call, a slap across my content face, and it scared me. If this were to happen, I am sure that I would not survive.It is so relevant to the world today that I thought it must have been written within the last few years, but come to find out that it was published in 1997! The concept of the Fugue State, the explanation of it, it really affected me. It scared me to realize that maybe this current economic \"fugue state\" isn't a fugue state at all... maybe it is permanent. I shudder to think it true.The only part of this book that I do not understand is the incest. It didn't disgust me as it does so many readers, but I found it to be completely unnecessary to the story. If anyone has any insight into this, I would love to hear it. Really.I feel certain that this book is going to instill in me a fierce lifestyle change. I may not grow my own vegetables or stop eating all processed foods, or decrease my carbon footprint, but I feel that my wasteful nature will surely diminish. And even if it only decreases by a fraction, the fact that this book has at all changed my habits is a testament to the quality and insight of its' content.Jean Hegland, it was a pleasure."}, {"userName": "Sandra Heinzman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4631139-sandra-heinzman", "userReview": "I read this book in two sittings, and I couldn't put it down. First, I could relate to the homeschooling/ unschooling in the story, as my family homeschooled for 12 years. Everything the girls (mainly Nell) learned, she learned on her own, through her own interests, from books, from trial and error, from invention. I found it all fascinating and believable, and often enviable. It is the first fiction book I've read about unschooling and it delivered! Also, I felt that the way the world was crumbling could actually happen during our lifetime, as the signs of \"Armageddon\" are here today. As to the characters, I liked Nell more than Eva, as I thought she was more I interesting and resourceful and nicer. I thought Eva was more selfish and self- centered and distant. But I did enjoy the whole ballet theme with Eva, as I have family members in ballet, as professional dancers. On the other hand, Nell was more needy. I admit that I did like her mother's pushing her to entertain herself, to pursue her own dreams, and to \"be her own person,\" when she whined about Eva's desertion of her in pursuit of ballet.At the end of the book Eva \"stepped up\" and took charge and I think the book ended in the best way it could. Her decision was the best course of action and well thought out. At the same time, it was a leap of faith and scary, to me, as I don't thnk I could live that way, forever. But, like Eva said, people lived like that for millenniums and the human race survived and thrived.I wonder if a sequel will be written? I want to know how Burl was raised (clothes? diapers?), what happened to the boyfriend who hiked across the U.S. to Boston, what happened to the rest of the U.S. and all other countries and societies, whether the girls ever leave the forest again, etc. etc. I cannot figure out the symbolism with the bear dreams. What did they all mean? Hopefully our book club discussion of the book will be interesting, stimulating, and dynamic! By the way, I cried at the end as I was very moved."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jessica", "userReview": "This book was SO good until about halfway when the author made it get extremely weird.

What strikes me, why I gave it a fifth star, is how it has remained relevant, fresh, shocking and provoking fifteen years after it was written. The United States in 2010 is closer to the brink than Ms Hegland envisioned in 1995; it is not much of a stretch to imagine a country that simply can't afford to pay its bills, where civil war erupts between political parties, where disease cannot be halted by technical innovation. But this story holds the outside world at bay; we have only vague notion of the collapse of modern society outside the northern California forest where two sisters in their late teens struggle to survive. Living with their parents in a home 30 miles from the nearest town, home-schooled and pursuing solitary passions, Eva and Nell are accustomed to isolation. But as their connections to society are severed and as society dies away, the sisters are forced to become pioneers on their own land, guardians of their homestead and safety. What Hegland does so skillfully is to convey the diminution of the girls' physical impact as the natural world seeks to reclaim her ground, yet also the strengthening of their characters and bodies as they are forced to work for their survival. Their belongings slowly compost along with their sense of time, their ambitions, and their childhood. There are scenes of horror, violence and passion that will make the reader wince, but they are rendered with great intelligence and beauty. There is also great hope and wisdom embodied in these two girls who become father, mother, lover and protector in the months that we are allowed into their world. This is not an easy novel to set aside and one that will be impossible to forget."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/846773-lee", "userReview": "This is a beautifully written book about two teenaged sisters who are left to fend for themselves after surviving the death of both parents. The older sister Nell paints a lovely portrait of a family who live by their own rules, on a large plot of land 30 miles from the nearest town. The girls have a free range education at home, roaming the forest, following their own interests until slowly things begin to change. A series of events leaves the girls stranded on their homestead, surviving on dwindling stores, and no contact with the outside world. As soon as I began reading this story, I was struck by how easily this could happen. All of the events felt real and possible. Our world seems very close to unraveling and this book brought immediately to my attention just how easily things could go awry. I asked myself if I have the skills and knowledge to survive in a world without electricity, access to food, heat, water, communication etc. Sadly, the answer is probably no. It was inspiring to read about how these girls learned to survive and at the same time deal with the extreme grief and loss of not only their family, but life as they knew it, their hopes and dreams. I found the choices they made at the end a little bit strange but it did not ruin the beauty of the story for me. 4.5 Stars."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155411-michael", "userReview": "There's a lot to like in Hegland's end-of-the-world story. For the first half, at least, it's the most hopeful apocalypse I've come across. Hegland dwells far more on the two teenage-sister main characters than on the means of the world's end (in fact, the precise reason is never fully explained). The end result is a family story and a survival story. An interesting angle on a notion that has been worked over many times."}, {"userName": "Lala BooksandLala", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31027440-lala-booksandlala", "userReview": "My final rating is a 4.5/5, only a few slight things took away from this being a perfect novel for me.

My opinion is probably not a popular thing but,but here it is anyway....It is given to you in pieces in a journal that one of the two sisters writes. Nell doesn\u2019t sound right later on in the book. Not that she should sound just \u201cright as rain\u201d, but she starts sounding like an old man rather than a young teenage woman. I love that she is smart, but she sounds like she suddenly became an old crone. Her experiences would age you, yes, but not the way this character was talking. Not to me. It didn\u2019t fit. It didn\u2019t work. Don\u2019t misunderstand, the other sister doesn\u2019t sound right either, but at least she is plausible and her reactions and words seem to fit. Eva sounds not quite right in a way that someone would be after her experiences. Some of this is just insane..? Really? I didn\u2019t really have a problem with the ending, more some of the things that seemed kind of plunked into the story as a \u201cfix it\u201d for whatever bad situation they were in. I kept thinking .. really? That is just how this book makes me feel, though you get the feeling it is supposed to make you feel uncomfortable. I was fine with that. You have to be willing to be uncomfortable in order to identify with characters sometimes. I was right with these girls and then the story just lost me and started to get weird. I did not see beauty.

I love to read books and then watch the movie (this one will be out July 22nd), but this may be one that I don't even bother seeing because the book was so idiotic. So there are two sisters and a father who live out in a house in the woods. Something happens in the world that causes electricity/phones to go out, although they go dead slowly so that the family kind of doesn't notice. Or gets used to it, or whatever. So when the electricity only comes on for half of the day, wouldn't it be a good idea to start prepping for the day when it doesn't at all? Like, setting up a garden/ building a strong fence/ stockpiling anything/everything? Maybe using Google when the power IS on to learn about how to hunt/trap/fish/gather berries? Even ONE YEAR after the electricity is out and they are all on their own (the nearest town has fallen into chaos and has no further supplies- also their father passed away due to a chainsaw accident), the two girls are both still doing their own \"things\"- one is practicing ballet to be able to get into a ballet company, and the other is reading encyclopedias to get into an Ivy League college. Uhm, hello! The country is in pandemonium! There IS no college, and there ARE NO ballet companies. Go outside and figure out how to make food or something else useful. Eventually the two sisters do learn to live off of the land, but they tip the see-saw way too far to that side by burning down their house to ONLY live in the forest! What a fantastic idea ladies! Who needs pre-made shelter with individual rooms? Go live in your tree and surely your habit for arguing with each other will go away. The whole book seems to be filled with the sisters making terrible decisions and it was just very annoying because neither of them have any real redeeming qualities. I also did not appreciate the single incestuous scene- that needs to be in the book because of what reason? I am appalled that someone read this and thought, \"Oh! This would be a great movie!\" Good luck with that... 0/5 stars, would not recommend for anyone."}], "description": "Set in the near-future, Into the Forest is a powerfully imagined novel that focuses on the relationship between two teenage sisters living alone in their Northern California forest home.Over 30 miles from the nearest town, and several miles away from their nearest neighbor, Nell and Eva struggle to survive as society begins to decay and collapse around them. No single event precedes society's fall. There is talk of a war overseas and upheaval in Congress, but it still comes as a shock when the electricity runs out and gas is nowhere to be found. The sisters consume the resources left in the house, waiting for the power to return. Their arrival into adulthood, however, forces them to reexamine their place in the world and their relationship to the land and each other.Reminiscent of Margaret Atwood's A Handmaid's Tale, Into the Forest is a mesmerizing and thought-provoking novel of hope and despair set in a frighteningly plausible near-future America.", "title": "Into the Forest", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86236.Into_the_Forest", "average": 3.79, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1479868647l/86236.jpg", "reviews": 1222, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/49347.Jean_Hegland", "name": "Jean Hegland"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Apocalyptic", "Science Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Young Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86236.Into_the_Forest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8103848-into-the-forest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36692897-into-the-forest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445583.Into_the_Forest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34908565-dans-la-for-t", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28248563-into-the-forest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178206.Windfalls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24694067-still-time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445582.The_Life_Within", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35585500-america---num-ro-2", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
