He does, however, call his mother annually on Mother's Day to assure her of his health and safety, then hangs up, leaving her frantic questions unanswered. Even his father's death in the 9/11 attacks didn't bring him home or break the pattern of his calls. Now, Carolyn MacKenzie has decided the only way to move on with her own life is to find closure and bring an end to the mystery of her brother's disappearance. This year when Mack makes his regular Mother's Day call, she declares her intention to track him down, no matter what. The following day, Monsignor Devon Mackenzie receives a scrap note reading: Uncle Devon, tell Carolyn she must not look for me. Despite the disapproval and angry reactions of loved ones, Carolyn persists in a search that plunges her into a world of unexpected danger and winding questions. What secret does the superintendents of Mack's former apartment have to hide? What do his old roommates know about his disappearance? Is he somehow connected to the girls who have themselves gone missing in the past ten years? Could he possibly be responsible for the brutal murder of his drama teacher and for what purpose?\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627: \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646

The author spent so much time building up to a finish, that when the finish came, it was quite a let down. I'm not talking a little let down, I mean really disappointing. The kind of thing where you finish reading and then look for the rest of the pages that obviously fell out of the book. She left the final scene until pretty much the last chapter. But then there was so much to finish off that it just said, \"Okay, all these people are dead, all the bad guys are dead, and no, it doesn't matter that there was so much more going on in the book, we are just trying to finish inside our allotted pages so this is what you get.\"I loved how the story got you involved, but if you are a reader who won't be able to separate your feelings about the ending for your feelings about the whole book, then you don't want to read this one."}, {"userName": "Marchelle", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/892555-marchelle", "userReview": "I always like Mary Higgins Clark because I know what I am getting.

I did like that the book was a page turner. I liked the short chapters allowing me to read 5 minutes here or 10 minutes there. I did like that it was an easy read for the situation I was in. I liked that the author included so many suspects. I did feel creepted out by the murderer thinking in first person. I did think it was blood and guts clean for a murder mystery.I was disappointed in the main character, Carolyn. She wasn't very characteristic of what I imagine a privileged, graduated Columbia law student, want to be DA (indicating to me a fighter, self assured, slightly arrogant, hard working, driven-kind of girl), New Yorker would be. This girl had no sense of self preservation (as all NY women have to consider constantly). I didn't feel like she was investigating and thinking to match her education and experience working for a judge. She almost seemed more like a high school graduate to me-inexperienced, naive, not real assertive....I thought the book was a little on the predictable side.I also thought the epilogue was not very complete about tying up all the lose ends.And, to learn Carolyn married Nick-again, high schoolish. To think of where she was in her life and where she wanted to go I was disappointed in this match. I thought he seemed like a stereo-typical club owner hitting on all the girls. I didn't see a lot of integrity in him. I thought he could of been more forthright with the police. It didn't help that as a college students, Mack-his best friend, didn't didn't think to highly of him for his sister."}, {"userName": "Tristi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1248475-tristi", "userReview": "Fans of Mary Higgins Clark know she has her formula. Her first four books didn't seem to be as formulaic, but ever since then, there are certain things we watch for. The mentally-incompetent person who knows something, but is being protected and told to shush, and when they finally talk, it's the clue to the whole case. We watch for the mentions of clothing and food (during the 1980's, the heroines wore capes and boots, and ate pasta and crusty bread with green salad and wine) We also know that it's the person we trust the most that has something to do with the crime, and it's the love interest that the heroine doubts, and then ends up with. So, because we know all this, why do we keep going back for more?Despite the formula that we all know by heart, Clark captures our imagination with the variety of settings in which she places the formula. In this book, Carolyn, our main character, has a brother named Mack who disappeared ten years ago. He calls every Mother's Day to tell his family not to worry, but he's not ready to come home. This year, though, Carolyn becomes angry at Mack's selfishness and tells him she's going to find him. Mack sends her a note, telling her that she must not try to find him. This further fuels her determination, and sets off a chain of events that drive a wedge between Carolyn and her mother.I pegged the bad guy pretty much from the first, but it was interesting to see all the little threads come together, including one element I hadn't figured out. No, I'm not giving clues -- you'll have to read the book.I enjoyed the story quite a bit and would have given it another star had it veered away from the formula a bit more. I haven't been really surprised by a Clark in years, but again, I enjoy the interactions of the characters and I appreciate the clean storylines and suspense without graphic descriptions. Clark is a legend, and for good reason."}, {"userName": "Siobhan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35855553-siobhan", "userReview": "I feel as though the Mary Higgins Clark books are good for quick reads.For me all her books seem to be three point five star books. They\u2019re good if you want something quick to read and yet I never seem to enjoy them as much as I love other authors. They\u2019re sort of just there for when I want something quick to read.I think my main problem is that they all seem to be a lot of the same, in my opinion. Whether it is simply due to the selection of her books I have read or whether such is the case all over I cannot say. However, I only really recommend them if you want something quick. For me they\u2019re never all that gripping and I never really connect with the characters. Whilst she is good at making you question characters it is still quite easy to work out the mysteries well in advance.

However, he does make oneritual phone call to his mother every year: on Mother's Day. Each time, heassures her he is fine, refuses to answer her frantic questions, then hangsup.

Charles McKenzie Jr. (known as \"Mack\" in this book) disappeared ten years ago shortly after his 21st birthday. Every year on Mother's Day he rings his mother and assures her that he is fine. Even when his father died on 9/11, he didn't emerge from hiding.And now his sister Carolyn Mackenzie has had enough. She is determined to find Mack and when he calls his mother on Mother's Day, she interrupts and announces her intention to locate him.Her search for Mack triggers a number of events including it seems the disappearance of a young woman, like Mack when he disappeared, on the eve of graduation. The connections with Mack's own disappearance are too coincidental to ignore.This isn't what I call a \"strong\" book, but I totally enjoy the whole story. I simply love it. The ending part is so sweet; Mack was found dead because he wanted to take responsibility for what he had done, and Carolyn ended up together with Nick DeMarco and their son was named after Mack's. One of big lessons I learned from this book is how much people appreciate someone that no longer exist around them. You will be automatically flashing back all the sweet memories and his/her good deeds, until sometimes you feel he/she is the best person in the world.I am a new fan of Mary Higgins Clark (since this is my first read of hers), so will say no more, I just love her books. She's one of the handful of authors I will actually read one by one. I think part of her appeal for me, apart from her speedy plots, are that the main character is always such a nice woman who is independent, capable, honorable, etc - just what I would love to be (or have been).Yes, the book is formulaic, but for this reader, highly superior and enjoyable formula."}, {"userName": "Jessica Flaska", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1028535-jessica-flaska", "userReview": "i finished this book last night and it was a pretty good book. again, mary hiigins clark goes back and forth and each chapter has to do with a different charachter in the character's going on's. but it does not get confusing and annoying. i liked ths tory line about the main character trying to find her brother and see what really happened and either him or turn hin over in the murders that have been recently linked to his sudden disappearance. his only sib, carolyn start trying to figure out what happened and things get worse with the police accusing her, her and her bro's friend of covering for him and things start to unravel towards the end with the truth. the beginning and middle are kind of a blame them who dunnit type thing. it gets kind of predictble on what really happened with one of the characters, but because of guessing with 3 of the characters, mainly two of them though, it keeps it ianteresting. it is an easy read and not a long book. than again, i cinsider nora roberts and harry potter that takes me about 3-4 days to read, long.the next book that i will be reading is by her daughter, carol higgins clark called zapped. a reagan reilly novel"}, {"userName": "Francesca Hurley", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/878442-francesca-hurley", "userReview": "this is a really good book. when mack disappears, the police suspect he's the reason why 4 other young women disappear in the next ten years. so when mack sends his sister a note saying not to look for him, it just make carolyn all the more determined. i wont spoil the ending, but i suggest that if you like to read about missing people or such, then it's a good book to read."}, {"userName": "Denise Dunbar", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1279050-denise-dunbar", "userReview": "Awesome mystery!"}, {"userName": "Sep", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2279945-sep", "userReview": "I do not read enough of Ms. Clark's books to know whether or not she was formulaic (an accusation in another review) but I do know that I did not guess who the bad guy was.

I have to admit that I spent a lot of this book confused because there were SO many characters. This might not have been a problem for me if I had been reading but I was listening to the audiobook and I just could not keep up with 16+ characters. Adding to my confusion was that SOME characters were also SOMETIMES called by their last names. That being said, so many possibilities for the who-diddit in a who-dunnit was a welcomed change. My only other gripe was I didn't care for the way the inner thoughts of the characters were so literally laid out. Each person's inner dialog contained way more information than I normally see.

A sua irm\u00e3 mais nova, Carolyn, passado dez anos do estranho desaparecimento do irm\u00e3o decide procura-lo, por\u00e9m o que poderia parecer um simples desaparecimento de um jovem, acaba por se mostrar algo muito mais perigoso.A divis\u00e3o realizada pela escritora, com cap\u00edtulos nos quais ia alternando o narrador, foi algo que me agradou bastante, tendo sido interessante constatar que somente no caso de Carolyn, a nossa personagem principal, o relato era efectuado na primeira pessoa, sendo os restantes na terceira. Poderia parecer confuso existir in\u00fameros narradores, mas a verdade \u00e9 que todas as personagens, mesmo aquelas que poderiam parecer n\u00e3o ter grande import\u00e2ncia para o desenrolar da trama, s\u00e3o efectivamente essenciais, fornecendo uma maior din\u00e2mica \u00e0 trama.Adorei a forma como a autora nos consegue ludibriar, levando-nos a pensar que eram determinadas personagens os causadores de todos os males que ocorrem e, no fim, todas as nossas conjunturas mostram-se erradas. Pessoalmente desde o in\u00edcio do livro que desconfiava de duas personagens e quando come\u00e7ava a pensar que me poderia ter enganado, a autora voltava a refor\u00e7ar as minhas suspeitas, contudo no fim os culpados eram duas personagens que nem por uma vez suspeitei delas, embora n\u00e3o simpatizasse muito com uma delas.Relativamente ao final da obra, embora tenha ficado um pouco triste, fiquei ao mesmo tempo maravilhada com a forma como a autora encaixou todas as pe\u00e7as do quebra-cabe\u00e7as na perfei\u00e7\u00e3o. Foi um final de cortar a respira\u00e7\u00e3o, com in\u00fameras revela\u00e7\u00f5es que fizeram com que tudo tivesse a sua raz\u00e3o de ser.Numa escrita flu\u00edda, tremendamente cativante, Mary Higgins Clark apresenta-nos um policial repleto de ac\u00e7\u00e3o, mist\u00e9rio, portador de uma grande carga emocional, que certamente agradar\u00e1 aos f\u00e3s deste g\u00e9nero liter\u00e1rio.(http://magia-livros.blogspot.pt/2012/...)"}, {"userName": "Kristy K", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32383826-kristy-k", "userReview": "While the overall premise of the book was intriguing, too many irritating things kept me from enjoying it. Told in multiple POVs (I lost count after the 10th person chimed in), much of the time in the beginning I had to skim back to figure out who was who and how (if at all) they connected.I found Carolyn, our only first person POV, to be an inconsistent character. One moment she's spouting about being an amazing lawyer and the next she's seeking counsel over general law questions any attorney should have known.The other major issue for me was how incompetent and cold-hearted the police were portrayed as. The hurting siblings of the missing were out finding clues (with no investigative background), while the police apparently never thought to look in those places. Furthermore, they were made out to look extremely closed minded and hyper-focused on one suspect (to which each officer had a different idea as to who that was). Although police do make mistakes, I found this an unrealistic portrayal of what would happen in these circumstances.The ending itself had a few good twists, but I felt the character development for most of the players was weak and made certain parts of the ending feel unbelievable. I haven't read a Clark novel since high school, and I remember them being more suspenseful, but now I am thinking that may have been my young age and more innocent mind. Sadly, I found the story and the writing to be subpar to what I've come to expect out of my mysteries and thrillers. For great mysteries, I recommend Tana French, Michael Connelly, and Kathy Reichs."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5599813-sandy", "userReview": "Mary Higgins Clark never disappoints me. Her writing is always smooth, her plots move along, and I like her protagonists. In this book, every Mother's Day, Charles \"Mack\" MacKenzie, Jr., calls his mother. But it's not your usual Mother's Day call because Mack walked out of his apartment one day and disappeared. Despite a nominal police investigation and a more thorough investigation by a P.I. no trace was found of the young man. However, a call received on the first Mother's Day after his disappearance assures the family that he is alive and well. But he never comes home, even after his father is killed in the 9/11 attack.Now, ten years later, his younger sister Carolyn decides that enough is enough and she's going to find him and tells him so on his annual phone call. When a note is dropped in the collection plate at the church where their uncle is priest, Carolyn knows that he's still in the New York area and she's more determined than ever to find him. But when a young woman goes missing, and by bringing her brother back to the attention of the police he becomes one of the prime suspects in a string of abductions of young women, Carolyn discovers that she may have stirred up a hornet's nest that will end up destroying her brother and her family.I enjoyed this book a great deal.

When I expressed my dismay, I was told she had branched out into different subjects. So I went to the library and picked out this one. I kept putting it off (I was only into about a third of it when book club day arrived)I considered skipping but I'm responsible for picking up a non driver to take with me.That first third was interesting enough that I continued reading until I finished.

What I most like about her books is that she builds suspense, but (for me at least) the solution isn't obvious from page 1 - having said that, though, you can still pick the book up and put it down to do something else without losing track of the story. Maybe that doesn't mean it's \"Literature,\" but I always enjoy her stories!This one is interesting to me, as it deals with a young man from a well-to-do family who disappeared suddenly, but who calls his mother every year on Mother's Day to wish her well and say that she is alright. At the beginning of the book, his younger sister decides that she is going to discover once and for all what happened. The next day at Mass, her uncle, a priest, finds a note in the collection box allegedly from the brother, warning the sister to leave well enough alone.As is often the case with the stories by this author, a current event happens that seems to bring past events to the forefront, and suddenly you don't know who may be worth trusting. I have to admit that I was completely surprised by the ending, as I truly did not suspect the character who was behind everything to play that role in the story.All in all, a good read, and a welcome respite from Serious Literature That You Should Always Be Reading ..."}], "description": "It has been ten years since 21-year-old Kevin MacKenzie, Jr. (\"Mac\"), has been missing.
