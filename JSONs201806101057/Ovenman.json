Yet somehow I could not relate to it or any of the characters. Maybe because I didn't grow up in 90's Florida, but if that's the case then the author didn't do his job properly because he made a book specifically for one small audience instead of creating a story that everyone could relate too and enjoy.I was excited about reading it at first and especially after some people had said it was written in a similar style to Irvine welsh and Chuck Palahniuk, which is just not the case. I found the characters very much unimaginative and stereotyped and I could not figure out why they all had stupid names? Was this supposed to be a kids book? And was it supposed to be funny?"}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36496881-daniel", "userReview": "I was disappointed in this book. ItStarted out awful. Got a little better then ended in a big flop. The main character literally gets drunk every night and blacks out at the age of 16. (Give or take) The only time the author does anything to capture the reader is when he describes some boarding moves or \"hip\" punk bands/ moves they use when partying. Overall pretty poor book. If I didn't buy this book for a few cents from my local library I wouldn't of finished it. Not a re read in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Tobias", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93250-tobias", "userReview": "A lot subtler than I'd expected -- you do get crazy drunken punk rock action, but the meditations on work, family, and relationships are what endures.

After being kicked out of the house by his parents for accidentally getting both arms covered in horribly mangled tattoos, 15-year-old When found himself forced to take a job in fast food and has been there ever since. Although a bit of a maestro in a restaurant, he's basically hapless in everything else. He's a skater who keeps losing his boards; his bulimic girlfriend sleeps in the living room, plagued by dreams that he's trying to kill her; he's the lead singer in a band who will only let him repetitiously sing the word \"Wormdevil,\" the band's name; and nearly every morning he finds himself reliant on the post-it notes his drunken self has affixed to his body in an effort to clue him in on the previous night's shenanigans. Although a terrible boyfriend who consistently steals here and there from the pizza restaurant that employs him, he's a fairly good guy; but when he wakes up one morning to discover a pizza box full of stolen money on his coffee table, things take a bit of a turn. Despite being hailed as \"uproariously funny,\" Ovenman is probably not the sort of book that would have made it into my shopping basket had it not been for my bracket in The Morning News's Tournament of Books. (Yes, it's sort of like a college basketball bracket, and yes I realize it's incredibly nerdy. Shut up.) Of course, this funky little book was quickly taken out in the first round by Denis Johnson's epic Tree of Smoke, I was intrigued at the description and figured I'd check it out. Basically, I have this theory that there are some things that are better on airplanes. Sprite? - better on an airplane. Individual packets of peanuts or pretzels? - better on an airplane. Tiny bottles of liquor? - good, but definitely better on an airplane. Hand-held gaming devices, Sudoku puzzles, tabloid magazines, and novels by Jennifer Weiner and Helen Fielding ? - all nice enough, but for some reason far, far better when enjoyed on an airplane. It's something about the tiny, enclosed space where you are forced to sit and enjoy something completely and entirely in one sitting that makes all these things more enjoyable than they would be most anywhere else. I feel similarly about Ovenman. It was an enjoyable read, but as strange as it sounds, I have a nagging feeling that it would have been ten times better if I would have read it on an airplane. For whatever that's worth."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/224876-amy", "userReview": "I'm usually prejudiced against twenty-something male slackers, but the narrator of Ovenman is incredibly likeable and warm-hearted. What's most impressive about this novel is the voice; it's very distinct from the first page, which is a rare quality. Funny, insightful, and surprisingly honest.The novel is well-paced, has great dialogue, and the relationship between the narrator and his girlfriend seems very real. Also, it's cool to read a novel about skaters and the early 90s. It was like a keyhole into the mind of someone I wouldn't have dated in high school (or after), but someone who I might've secretly had a crush on. In terms of the arc, the novel is a bit sprawling and meandering. But I suppose that's just part of slackerdom."}, {"userName": "Jeff Lanter", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2188384-jeff-lanter", "userReview": "Ovenman has a demographic. People who lived from the 90's, know skateboarding, know punk rock, and have visited Florida (and not just the beaches). If you're like me and almost all of these things apply to you, this book is likely to be relatable and to entertain. Jeff Parker really captures the aimless feel of these characters living day to day. From drunken escapades to acting on the fly, Thinfinger is an enjoyable character to follow through life. While the ending was both very satisfying and also kind of a letdown, that does not blemish what is an otherwise entertaining book. Parker's unique voice triumphs in Ovenman and if the setting and characters sound at all appealing, this book is well worth your time."}, {"userName": "Logan Doyle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34890252-logan-doyle", "userReview": "I was pleasantly surprised with this book. It made me laugh quit a bit. I worked in the serving industry for 9 years and could relate to a lot of the charactors in the novel. Even biodad. I was about halfway through still wondering where this is going? What's the point of having written this book? It comes around. The number of people like When out there will astound you. There are so many versions of him in this industry, male female, cooks, servers.. hell even Managers. I would rather have seen this as a movie over \"Waiting\" which was an industry favorite. Pleasantly surprised with this one."}, {"userName": "Karen Germain", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72310-karen-germain", "userReview": "I have mixed feelings about this book. It started out strong and I appreciated some of the dry humor. Overall, I think the characters and the situation grew a little long, the last third of the book started to drag. It sort of redeemed itself with the ending. I really liked the last two pages. I think that this book had enough style and qualities that I liked and I would give Jeff Parker another shot.I liked this quote from Sam Lipsyte wrote in the forward, \"Slackerdom's one thing. Slacking is quite another.\" I thought this was really appropriate to the characters. Sadly, I found many similarities to people I know in real life."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49681-amanda", "userReview": "The jacket calls Ovenman's protagonist, When, a \"ne-er-do-well.\" I think that's hilarious. When himself would fail utterly to be either offended or flattered by the term; not because he doesn't know what it means, just because it's so far outside his personal realm of thought. It's so something his girlfriend's dad would say. I got very excited about this book. It's all about voice, told in a voice that's beautifully consistent in humor, sadness, and strangeness. It is a fast, funny read. My only worry about it is that I may love it because I'm no longer a young ne'er-do-well myself; at eighteen, would I have found it patronizing? I hope not. But I don't think so."}, {"userName": "William Powhida", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/995433-william-powhida", "userReview": "My collaborator and fellow instigator Jeff Parker got his first novel published last year. I failed to get my cover design on this book, but you can still see the partial remains in the background of the school bus yellow. It's probably more appropriate, that failure, to the spirit of the book than anything else. It's the story about a dude with bad tattoos trying to figure out how he ended up with such bad tattoos. If history is written on the skin then When Thinfinger has had a real bad deal and it's time to do something about it. A man can't live with pillows for sleeves forever if he wants to get a little bit of respect."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/952321-pamela", "userReview": "I was a little wary of the book since the intro was written by Sam Lipsythe- and his book Homeland made me too uncomfortable to finish reading. However, I decided to open my mind to the genre I like to refer to as 'depressed white guy narrative'. Glad I did. There were a few characters that weren't fully formed for me; I could never really picture Marigold. But this book is solid- it's a story; I like stories. I spend all my time writing 3rd person science writing. So in my free time, I love to read stories.
