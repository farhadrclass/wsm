It is set at West Point during the late 1960\u2019s as the Vietnam War is starting to become unpopular.Ry Slaight first hears almost by accident that cadet whose body was found drowned earlier that day may have been murdered. When he finds no investigation is being done in the case, he begins to ask questions, and in the process finds himself running afoul of the commandant of cadets, who is trying to have the head of the Academy ousted so he can take his job. With the help of several people from the Academy, including several of his fellow cadets and his law professor who also becomes his legal adviser, his girlfriend, the daughter of an Israeli general, and his former girlfriend, the dead cadet\u2019s sister, he eventually finds the truth about the murder. But in the end he finds that the purpose of the investigation is as much to discover the truth about the Academy and the army, and the truth about himself as it is to see justice done for the murder."}, {"userName": "Cws", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/823026-cws", "userReview": "M Tru"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1163039-karen", "userReview": "Another Bookbub book\u2026good price but just an ok book (3minus).
