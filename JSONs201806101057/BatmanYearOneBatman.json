This book has come to define the way we think of Batman today and was influential on the darker, grittier cape comics of the eighties and early nineties.But it is also instrumental in introducing what made that period of comics so ridiculous. It's been praised for its gritty realism, but like any Miller book, it's more sensationlist than realist: a hard-boiled patina over an idealized superhero core.Sure, Batman screws things up a few times in this, and seems to get shot, beaten, and burned in every attempt to stop a crime, but these are primarily to push the melodrama, not to enforce realism. We'll get a classic Miller line about a bullet's 'searing-hot flash of metal numbing my leg', but then Batman gets up, runs around, kicks through a brick wall, and at one point, takes a ski vacation to rehabilitate.The wounds aren't there to make Batman human, they're to make him totally manly and awesome. It's an eighties action movie where our hero gets shot in the shoulder just so he can wrap it up, grit his teeth, and take out some armed men with karate.But Miller's a good writer. He has a strong voice and a compelling sense of pacing, and if this story brings realism to Batman, it's in the small human moments, particularly Gordon's story, though he scraps like a Sin City tough, too, quipping to himself \"it's been years since I had to take out a Green Beret\".The way Batman takes death-defying risks every few pages isn't a sign of greater maturity or realism, it's just a switch to a different kind of ridiculous, epic melodrama. Sure, it's much more bloody and grim, but if adding blood and sex to a story was all it took to write mature, realistic stories, film critics would spend their careers analyzing slasher movies.Of course, it wouldn't be a Frank Miller story without whores, which is where we get to his rewrite of Catwoman: she's a leather-clad prostitute with a child prostitute sidekick. She doesn't have as much character as the men, in fact Gordon's monologues run right over her scenes, denying us insight.But even with the mandatory prostitutes and Die Hard injuries, it's a fun book, with character and story and some well-crafted dialogue. More than that, it's a vision of how to create male fantasies without catering to preteen boys. It forms a part of that influential, genre-shifting period defined by 'Wathcmen' and it stands as an integral part of the modern Batman character.\nMy Suggested Readings in Comics"}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/922495-patrick", "userReview": "To me, Batman is kinda like Pizza. By which I mean that even bad pizza is still pretty good. But for me, the best Batman is written by Miller. Maybe it's because I like his writing style, or maybe it's because his fairly dark writing style really suits Batman. Or it could just be that the very first comic I read as adult was Dark Night Returns. That's the comic that made me realize that comics weren't just a bunch of silly bullshit stories for kids. Whatever the reason, this comic is in that fine Frank Miller style. Showing Batman and Gordon at the beginning of their lives. Both of them making mistakes. Both of them learning about their city. Both of them paying for their mistakes.... Yeah. If you're into Batman and you haven't read this one, you're missing out. You should try it."}, {"userName": "Ahmed  Ejaz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53694260-ahmed-ejaz", "userReview": "I would have loved it more if graphics were the work of nowadays' technology.\nI am planning to read my favourite superheros' origin. And I have started with my absolute-favourite superhero, Batman. I knew about his origin before. But reading it was a good experience also.There was also an appearance of Catwoman a.k.a Selina. She didn't appear much. There was just a brief intro of how she became Catwoman. She seemed to me an anti-batman.Lt. Gordon was a good character. But his affair with Sarah seemed pretty much a filler. I highly recommend this comic if you wanna know how Batman came into being.

Maybe it's all I deserve, now. Maybe it's just my time in Hell.\"One of my absolute favorite Batman comics ever. It's quiet, subtle, realistic, noir. This is probably the most accessible Batman comic ever and where new readers should start, because while The Dark Knight Returns is Batman's omega, Batman Year One is his alpha. David Mazzucchelli is sublime. He illustrates with pure balance: minimal while detailed, bright yet dark, bold yet subtle. His characters are incredibly emotive, his splash pages and large panels iconic. This wouldn't be the same, especially with Miller's illustrations, if Mazzucchelli hadn't illustrated. This is a stylized and expanded origin story, not a retelling, as Dennis O'Neil tells us in the introduction. Jim Gordon arrives in Gotham, while twenty-five year old Bruce Wayne returns after being abroad. Harvey Dent leads a crusade, Commissioner Loeb and Detective Flass corrupt, and Selina Kyle steals as Catwoman. There's plenty to see from a wide array of characters. Interestingly, this isn't your typical Batman versus Villains book. But rather Batman and Jim Gordon versus Gotham. Apart from Geoff Johns' Batman Earth One, this is one of the rare stories where Batman is an amateur. Initially without a disguise, rules or purpose. He gets hurt and shot. Soon realizing fear is the element he lacks and must instill in his enemies. There's one particular scene which shows Bruce in an armchair in his study in moonlight, with a bat breaking through the window. Essentially the pivotal scene where he decides to become Batman. I've seen this in several other comics, including Snyder's and Morrison's Batman runs. So it's great to know where it comes from, assuming this scene isn't referencing some other Silver or Golden Age comic I haven't yet read. What else to say? This is legendary. It's a small book, a short story. There's no Rogue Gallery, no nuclear missiles, no huge international conspiracies. No time travel or multiverse. Just noble Batman, a hard boiled Jim Gordon, and Gotham on a rainy night."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "Meh.

There are aspects to them to appreciate and patient readers can be rewarded greatly with those books. But let's be honest - most of us view classics as a bit of a chore. But what about classic comics? Kind of the same thing, but not for so many. Some classic comics, Marvel and DC especially, are tough to read because the stories from the 40s and 50s are so badly written and cheesy, and the art is hit or miss, though most of them possess a guileless charm to them that makes them easier to stomach. When it comes to comics, no character stands taller than Batman, and no Batman book has more of a reputation than Year One. Is it a chore to read? No. Has it aged poorly? Not even a bit. Does it deserve it's title as a true bona fide classic? (Austin Powers voice) Yeah, baby! Year One is Frank Miller and David Mazzuchelli's retelling of Batman's origin and through their retelling they set the tone and standard for all other Batman books that followed. A 25 year old Bruce Wayne returns to a nightmarish Gotham City riddled with crime at the same time as an older but still young James Gordon, recently transferred to the GCPD and entering Gotham City for the first time. Both men have a clear mission: to clean up the streets of crime and make Gotham habitable for decent, hardworking folks.Some readers have wondered why Gordon gets as much space - maybe more - as Bruce Wayne in this book and the answer is simple: they're both two sides of the same coin. The very first Batman story opens with Bruce and Jim sitting, talking about crime, and Jim is arguably Batman's best friend. Batman's origin would tie in with Gordon's as their lives will be linked forever once they dig their heels in and bring justice to Gotham.It's been a few years since I read Year One and I really hoped it would hold up - and it did. Whatever your feelings are about Frank Miller today (and he has unfortunately gone from genius writer to crackpot old man), his work in the 80s ranks amongst the best the comics medium has ever produced, and Year One is arguably the pinnacle of that work. He went from telling the last Batman story ever with The Dark Knight Returns to, with his next book, going back to the very beginning and telling the first Batman story ever - and both are masterpieces.In just four issues, we see Bruce get into his first fight as an unmasked vigilante, to realising he must don a disguise, to the famous \"Yes. Father. I will become a bat\" scene, to his fledgling first missions to clear up corrupt police, mob bosses, and the iconic dinner party scene where he appears to Gotham's most powerful and evil to inform them they have eaten well but from now on none of them are safe. And the scene when Batman takes down the SWAT team? Brilliant. Still tense, exciting, and fantastic to read.It's a testament to Miller's writing that he's able to take Gordon, who for many is little more than a one-note background character, and makes you care about him as much as you do Batman. Gordon becomes Gotham's first non-corrupt officer, fighting his own colleagues (literally and figuratively) to uphold the law and become better than the criminals they chase, while his wife is pregnant with James Jr. (see Batman: The Black Mirror for what happened to James Jr. when he grew up) and the stresses of the job leading to him make some bad decisions.We also meet Selina Kyle for the first time, working as a dominatrix in Gotham's red light district, as she decides to become her own costumed character, Catwoman, after first seeing Batman. Mazzuchelli's art in this book is flawless but my one criticism of the book is Catwoman's outfit - I hate the whiskers and tail! What use are either to a cat burglar? And it just looks stupid.Anyway, Year One is a must-read for all Batman fans - as if you didn't already know! Everyone who has even a cursory knowledge of Batman comics knows Year One is one of the first to read. And it is - but it's also one to re-read and come back to again and again because there are a LOT of Batman books, but few of such high quality as Year One. A great beginning for the Dark Knight and the man who would be Commissioner. Just don't read Year Two!"}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "I've never been much of a super hero fan. And to me, Batman will always be Adam West's campy TV show of my youth. Bap! Zammm! Kapow!BUT...there's something about beginnings that appeals to me. I like watching a guy discovering and honing his powers. I'm remembering my favorite parts of two super hero movies I was forced to sit through - Spiderman on a rooftop, trying to figure out how to get his web thingamajig to work - \"Um, Shazam?\" and Iron Man crashing through his grand piano. Once they've got the kinks worked out, it basically becomes a guy in a costume fighting another guy in a costume and I quickly lose interest. This book covers the early years of not just Batman, but Cat Woman and James \"Someday He'll Be Commissioner\" Gordon as well. Gotham City is a sin-infested cesspool with enough vice and corruption to keep these three in business for years to come.

In fact, it has been almost a decade since I last picked up a comic book. Somewhere around moving from one place to another, sorting life after graduation, this one found itself buried and waiting. Two episodes of the new Flash down and one of the Arrow, then a few of The Walking Dead, and I hate this waiting. I prefer my comic manna to be delivered in a line, to be downed one after the other in quick intense sessions. That left me elbow deep in the still unopened boxes occupying almost half my room (procrastinator alert!) and I finally fished this one out . I took the picture below for my Instagram account months earlier. This is a perfect introduction to the character of Batman and while I say that I realise that there probably isn\u2019t anyone who requires an introduction to this character. But this book is full of nifty little titbits.The story traces from the beginnings of the dark hero. As the title suggests it begins the origin of batman, the origins which fork into two different timelines. A more gritty and acidic side to the hero as foreseen by Frank Miller and then, the more famous generic doppelganger.The comic is a character study, and weirdly as I have come to associate with Miller, not a study of our Knight himself, but rather of the Police Commissioner Gordon who is then Lieutenant Gordon. Whereas the bat inspires fear, Gordon lends a more relatable and humane taste to the story. It is weird, because it being a story of the origin of Batman, would treat him more as a garnish, but it works. Those familiar with the Tv series Gotham, could find this in the same alley. A corrupt city decaying and retching from its own stench, and an even more corrupt police force and our one man army fighting to survive against it and overcome the odds. This is Gordon. But he isn\u2019t heroism personified. He is a deeply flawed character and as often found battling against himself as he is found avenging the city. Contrary to the Tv, the Bat isn\u2019t a kid here. He is grown up and is the more shadowy figure who serves the vigilante angle, a little less cocksure of himself, and sometimes stumbling on his feet. He has just returned from training and we get to see him on his first night out as a vigilante. He is not yet a bat. The inspiration is yet to strike him. And he fumbles. Here we are introduced to the hero who is yet in the making and is a long long way to being the person who will eventually face Ra\u2019s al Ghul or even Bane.Catwoman makes an appearance here as a prostitute, although her story is redefined in a later issue as a thief who pretends to be a prostitute in order to steal. As far as covers for crime go, I am not sure I follow this one as thoroughly. A classic story with a very distinct goth feel. This one was reminiscent of the old superhero movies. The artwork left a lot to be desired. And I missed the emotional connection with this. There was no black hole left behind after the final page was turned. It was power packed but not packed enough. Still, it was an enjoyable read and should definitely be counted as a must read."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Terrington", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6313408-jonathan-terrington", "userReview": "Year One is the Batman origin that everyone currently knows. It is the origin story that until Frank Miller wrote it, did not exist. And therefore, while the book may not appear ground-breaking currently; at its time of publication it was incredibly fresh. It was the gritty, revenge seeking origin story of Bruce Wayne that audiences wanted.However, in all honesty Bruce Wayne cannot be called the protagonist in this novel. As I recently read: the protagonist is the character which shows change and development in the novel. And in this novel it is Lieutenant James Gordon who is the protagonist in my eyes. At the beginning of the novel Gordan is a young, almost naive cop, unhardened by the cruelty of Gotham and unprepared for the duties of being one of the few moral men in a city of disrepute. Where on the other hand Batman/Bruce Wayne is the vengeful hero attempting to fight crime, taking bullets and making mistakes all to show (as other reviewers have pointed out) how awesome he is.Frank Miller's work on Batman in general is always solid and reinforces the idea of the gritty and brooding Dark Knight. However, regardless of who writes a Batman story the character is always greater than the individual writer, much like any other great character of fiction. A strong and powerful character may not be as strong in certain author's hands but nothing prevents them from being altered indescribably (otherwise that is not the same character). One may debate whether the newer versions of Doctor Who, Star Trek, Star Wars and so forth are as legitimate or true versions, but they are the same characters regardless. Batman here may be the gritty dark knight (as in The Dark Knight Returns) but that does not destroy the fact that he can be a more comic or noble caped crusader and still be the same character."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike", "userReview": "Ever since finishing The Caped Crusade I have had a hankering to read one of the iconic Batman stories. As many plaudits as Batman: The Dark Knight Returns has received I was more drawn to this book because it tells the story of Batman's initial forays into vigilante justice (plus I had recently seen Batman v Superman and didn't need to see them fight yet again). While this collection of comics (four to be exact) are titled Batman, this is a story just as much about Jim Gordon (the future commissioner and Bat ally). Instead of fighting colorful villains from his rouge's gallery Batman's target in the beginning is vice and corruption, from the junkie mugger on the street up to the very apex of political power in Gotham.Gordon, meanwhile, has moved from Chicago to Gotham under a cloud of police misconduct and is looking for a new start for himself and his pregnant wife. What he finds is a police force riddled with corruption and naked brutality more than willing to use violence and intimidation to keep their own officers in line.I find the story itself quite engaging, especially as we see matters from both Batman's and Gordon's perspective. Even better this isn't the omnipotent bad-ass Batman but a very green, very inexperienced one. He screws up, he makes mistakes, and he learns from them. He faces legitimate threats and rarely comes out unscathed. Gordon, meanwhile, must navigate a corrupt system with little to protect him than the press's adulation of his police heroics. We also get a small peek at Catwoman's origins and a young Harvey Dent.The comic panels are all rather washed out and dark, conveying a very catastrophic and dingy feeling to the streets of Gotham City. Given the subject matter and the state of the city I thought this artistic choice was spot on. This isn't a flashy, bright, septic city of the future like Metropolis but a gritty, crumbling city of Gotham. While the atmosphere is dark the story and content were pretty straight forward, nothing like the ultra gloomy and gratuitously dark stuff we get these days.All in all this was a very enjoyable experience. The pages just flew by while the story explored a fascinating point in a beloved character's history. This is a great starting point for someone interested in getting into Batman comics because it isn't weighed down by decades of canon and backstory."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54068-adam", "userReview": "I'm not a big fan of superhero origin stories, so I avoided reading Batman: Year One for awhile, but I'm really glad I finally picked it up and gave it a try. This four-issue series totally blew me away. It got to the heart of everything I've always loved about Batman, while giving equal time to Commissioner Gordon (still a lieutenant in Year One). Gordon has always been one of my favorite supporting characters in Batman's world, and I think he rarely gets his due, so it was nice to read a story that focused almost as much on him as it did on Bruce Wayne. Frank Miller's storytelling is lean and mean, and avoids the excesses that he frequently indulges in, and never falls into the trap of rote, by-the-numbers plotting that so many origin stories do. The art, by David Mazzucchelli, is gritty and impressionistic without being deliberately abstract or confusing.

Since I have been reading a lot of comics lately, especially the \u201cX-Men\u201d comics, I wanted to try a different comic book series and that is where I started reading up on \u201cBatman.\u201d So, the first \u201cBatman\u201d comic I have actually came upon recently is a little gem that I have just noticed lately and that is \u201cBatman: Year One\u201d by Frank Miller along with artwork by David Mazzucchelli along with coloring by Richmond Lewis. \u201cBatman: Year One\u201d is truly a brilliant comic book that newer fans of \u201cBatman\u201d can easily get into!\nWhat is this story about?\nThis story basically retells the origins of Bruce Wayne as Batman as it details Bruce Wayne\u2019s first year as Batman and all the struggles he overcomes in his new role as Batman. This story also details about Commissioner James Gordon\u2019s first year as a lieutenant of the police force before he became a commissioner.\nWhat I loved about this story:\nFrank Miller\u2019s writing: Frank Miller\u2019s writing was so amazing and simple to read through, especially if you are new to the \u201cBatman\u201d comics and you need a good place to jump right in the series. Frank Miller has created a more modern spin on the origins of Batman without changing the original history of Batman (his parents are killed before him when he was a child and he decides to become the famous caped crusader he is today) and I especially loved the way that Frank Miller details Batman\u2019s first year fighting crime as being difficult since Bruce Wayne had difficulties in becoming the crime fighting caped crusader since the public viewed him as a menace the moment he started fighting crime. I also loved the way that Frank Miller shown the months that all of this was taking place from January fourth to December third which gave an extremely detailed timeline of this story. What really interested me about this story was learning about the origins of Commissioner James Gordon since I have not really been exposed to his origins and it was interesting to see how James Gordon actually started out as a lieutenant of a police force that was corrupted by the crimes of Gotham City and how he tried to do his best to protect the citizens of Gotham City from such criminal activities.David Mazzucchelli and Richmond Lewis\u2019 artwork: David Mazzucchelli and Richmond Lewis\u2019 artwork is simplistic yet gives a dramatic feel to the story, especially during the scenes where the characters are in shadows and they give out an eerie feel to the scene they are associated with, like during the scene where James Gordon is attacked by hit men and Richmond Lewis\u2019 red coloring that flashes on the characters\u2019 faces makes this scene extremely intense as you can see the pain and sorrow on James Gordon\u2019s face. I also loved the shadowing that Richmond Lewis applies to Batman as Batman is usually shown in the dark and the dark shadowing makes him look menacing.\nWhat made me feel uncomfortable about this story:\nThe only problem with this comic book novel is that there is some blood in some scenes, especially during the scenes where some of the characters are shot. Also, there is some language in this book that might offend some readers, so if you do not like dark themed books that deal with crimes in the cities, then this graphic novel might be hard to read through.\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall, \u201cBatman: Year One\u201d is not only a brilliant read for \u201cBatman\u201d fans everywhere, but it is also a great place to get into the \u201cBatman\u201d comic series, especially for new fans who are just getting into the \u201cBatman\u201d comics and want to know how Batman\u2019s origins came about!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog"}, {"userName": "\u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1775679", "userReview": "In 1986 Frank Miller has given The Dark Knight - and the whole world of graphic novels - a whole new dark dimension, with his legendary \"The Dark Knight Returns\".

This was a dark vision of a complex and troubled soul driven to fight crime to avenge his parent\u2019s senseless death, and it resonated with a new generation of readers and gained comics greater credibility among mainstream readers. Just one year later Miller produced a four-part story arc called Batman: Year One (1987). Though not as iconic as The Dark Knight Returns, this story of Batman and Jim Gordon\u2019s early days is regarded by many as one of the best Batman stories ever told.Origin stories are very popular in the comics world, and this is one is a finely-nuanced character study of two complex individuals. We all know that Batman\u2019s parents were gunned down by a mugger outside a movie theater when he was a small boy. This traumatic event, along with an underground cave filled with bats and his lonely upbringing in his parents\u2019 palatial and brooding Wayne Manor, led him to become the caped crusader who hunts down criminals in the dead of night. But what did Bruce Wayne do for the 18 years after being orphaned? Would you believe he lived in Europe, learning every form of fighting batman year one 1imaginable, in order to someday avenge his parents\u2019 murders? And that his first fumbling attempts to fight criminals would almost get him killed, again and again, before he settled on a costume to hide his identity and strike fear into his enemies\u2019 hearts. In his early days, Batman gets beat up, stabbed, etc. in the process of trying to help others who don\u2019t realize his intentions. Who would have thought doing good could be so punishing?Batman: Year One really surprised me with how realistic, gritty, and crime noir the storyline was. It\u2019s not well known that Batman was originally a detective, not a superhero. It\u2019s always been a given that Gotham City is a crime-ridden version of New York, filled with hoodlums and thugs in every alley and dark corner. But what I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the level of blatant corruption in the Gotham City police department, which Lieutenant James Gordon encounters on his first day in the force. His partner is a thug named Flass, with Green Beret training, who casually beats up street teens and laughs it off on their first day together. Gordon is then introduced to police commissioner Gillian Loeb, a loathsome and corrupt man who reminds Gordon that loyalty and teamwork (read: don\u2019t rock the boat) are the keys to success on the force. Gordon quickly discovers that most of the cops on the force are on the take, involved in drug trades, shakedowns, kickbacks, and every other form of graft imaginable. This all goes on under the direction of Loeb, and no cop is stupid enough to fight this, except the stubborn Gordon. As a result, he is repeatedly subjected to attacks and beatings by other cops. I\u2019m guessing this aspect of Gotham was not explored in the earlier Batman comics, though I could be wrong. Gordon has heard about the Batman, a strange vigilante preying on small-time criminals between midnight and 4am. The Batman is disrupting the established routine of the crooked cops, so Loeb demands that Gordon take him down. However, as Gordon learns more about Batman\u2019s acts of heroism, he begins to wonder whether Batman really is a menace to society or not.Meanwhile, Batman antagonizes commissioner Loeb past the breaking point, so he sends out a ruthless SWAT team armed with M-16s to hunt down Batman in an abandoned warehouse. Gordon is outside, helpless to prevent orders to kill Batman on sight. This is an extended action sequence that is incredibly cinematic and reminded me of Die Hard, the lone hero fighting against hordes of rivals, except in this case these are cops and Batman doesn\u2019t want to hurt them if possible. But they show no such mercy, dropping explosives on the building. By some miracle, Batman manages to escape despite being shot and hurt, with a burning building collapsing about him.Miller does an excellent job of depicting a police force thoroughly corrupt at every level. I felt like I was watching Al Pacino\u2019s Serpico, Kevin Costner\u2019s Untouchables, or James Ellroy\u2019s L.A. Confidential. And Gordon\u2019s character stands out for his noble refusal to go along with things despite the backlash. However, things are pushed to a breaking point when Loeb has Gordon\u2019s wife and young child kidnapped by goons. Gordon goes into kick-ass mode, fighting back in a white-hot fury. When he tracks down the kidnappers, it is Batman that provides critical assistance at a key moment. So although Gordon does not know Batman\u2019s true identity, he also understands there are good intentions there. It\u2019s clear that they will forge a strange alliance against all the criminals in Gotham City, both inside the police force and on the streets.The recent GOTHAM TV series has really fueled my interest in Batman\u2019s origins. It explores the early years of Bruce Wayne, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent, as well as many of Batman\u2019s most infamous enemies. It\u2019s hard to imagine a series 20 years ago centering on so many villains, depicting them as often good-intentioned people who went astray due to bad circumstances. We get a glimpse of the early Penguin, Joker, Riddler, Two-Face, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Falcone, Maroni, Loeb, etc. It\u2019s a fresh angle to the BATMAN story, and one worthy of its own review."}, {"userName": "Michelle Morrell", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127000-michelle-morrell", "userReview": "Batman: Year One follows Jim Gordon as he arrives in Gotham City and makes his way through a police presence rife with corruption.

It's actually one of the only DC books I did read when I was young. However, it's been over ten years and I was like I have to re-read it to see if I still enjoy it. As you can tell with my score, it's pretty obvious. Have you've ever seen Batman Begins? A lot of the one/feel of that movie owes to this. Even basically taking the ending right out of the pages of this book. This is really two stories, two origins, in one. It focuses on Bruce becoming Batman and Gordan becoming Commissioner. You can see how vastly different they are yet how similar they COULD be. It's actually a ballsy move when you title it \"Batman\" and have Gordan probably have more page time. What I liked: Everything to do with Gordan is great. From him being a honorable cop to a shitty husband. To siding with Batman at times, while challenging his views too. Also gotta love how smart Gordan is and knows who Batman is but that's not important, but more important to keep some hope in Gotham. Bruce origins has been told a million times, but back then, this was pretty great way to get into Batman. What I didn't like: Some of the faces and such a mushy. I also think the Catwoman subplot is really really boring. Overall, it's a perfect comic to jump into and enjoy. It has the Batman tone you've come to love, two well told stories, and solid art most of the time. Sure Catwoman is just a add on but everything else in the book is pretty impressive."}, {"userName": "Foad", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2015", "userURL":

Superman and Wonder Woman's origin might need some freshening up, the mythology surrounding the origin of Batman worked without any tweaks or revamps. Instead what the origin of Batman needed was a different take on the classic origin. The result is Frank Miller's highly influential, much revered four-issue work Batman: Year One.Going back to the early days of the Batman saga, the story chronicles the rise of not only Batman but also Jim Gordon. A disgraced officer from another city, Gordon comes into the corrupt world of Gotham politics and starts trying to make a difference. At first, he's willing to hunt down the vigilante who is cleaning up Gotham's streets but over the course of the year he realizes that there could be something more to the Batman. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne is taking is first tentative steps toward becoming the savior that Gotham needs and trying to avenge the death of his parents.If you've seen Batman Begins, you've seen elements of this story realized on-screen. However, while that movie is good, it's always fascinating to go back to the source material and see how its not only similar but also different. Year One works extremely well because of the parallel view points of Gordon and Bruce Wayne. It's easy to see why this four-part series is so influential and so cited as one of the great story arcs in comic book history. It easily earns all its accolades and then some."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin", "userReview": "First crack at a DC comic and this was definitely a great place to start.

I'm not even an art guy so I should probably stop trying to describe the artistic awesomeness of this book. Oh, and there was a story, too. A very dark, depressing story that felt like The Dark Knight trilogy, which definitely took plenty of inspiration from these pages. The story was full of corrupt cops, evil villains, crime, and everything you would expect to find in Gotham City. It was action-packed, too.

One of the biggest pleasures of the films for me is Gary Oldman's portrayal of Jim Gordon, and easily my favorite thing about Year One is Jim Gordon. In his review of The Dark Knight, Peter Travers said that Oldman \"is so skilled that he makes virtue exciting,\" and it can certainly be said of the complex, flawed Gordon portrayed here--his virtue is exciting. Don't get me wrong, I love Batman, but I've always been a sucker for working-class heroes and this book makes Gordon as much a hero, in his everyday way, as Batman is in his grandiose and theatrical way. I also like the way that, like the films, this tale addresses the issue of escalation among the criminals of Gotham. Batman doesn't create himself to fight off the Jokers and Riddlers and Penguins of the city. He starts by fighting run-of-the-mill thugs and organized crime families. These heightened criminal elements are, in a way, a result of Batman's existence.But, yeah, mostly it's about Jim Gordon for me."}, {"userName": "Jedi JC Daquis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10205554-jedi-jc-daquis", "userReview": "This is indeed the definitive origin of the Dark Knight. No wonder this is among the top three (with The Dark knight Returns and The Killing Joke), if not the best Batman story to date. You do not call yourself a Batman fan or reader if you haven't read Batman: Year One.What makes Year One great is the fact that there is no single villain Batman is dealing with in Frank Miller's masterpiece. He has just donned the mantle of the Bat so we can give him a break. There's just a couple of mobs, goons and authorities Bats has to deal with, making clear that Batman is certainly fighting a war he's not going to win, or lose.Batman doesn't take all the spotlight here, there's also Selina Kyle, who will all know become Catwoman, and the ever morally-incorruptible James Gordon, who like Bruce Wayne has just arrived at Gotham City. Jim's a badass by the way.Year One, with all those great reviews, doesn't give you that loud \"KAPOW\" that you might expect.
