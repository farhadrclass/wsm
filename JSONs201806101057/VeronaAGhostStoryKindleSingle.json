They are, however, beset by peculiar occurrences from the moment they arrive, as well as finding themselves strangely drawn to a particular church and its distinctive stained glass window... Verona seems to riff on both Daphne du Maurier's 'Don't Look Now' and the ancient religious horrors found in many of M.R. James's stories. It is subtler and, in my opinion, more effective than Abbot's Keep, the other ghost story I've read by Ashforth, and apparently his most widely read. It doesn't induce electrifying terror, but there were definitely more than a few moments that gave me chills. If you like this sort of thing then I'd certainly recommend it, and I'll be investigating the rest of Ashforth's stories at some point too.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "F.R.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1309606-f-r", "userReview": "Given how often modern horror writers want to dress up and pretend they\u2019re H.P. Lovecraft, it\u2019s always lovely to find one content to wrap himself in a comfortable old frock-coat and imagine himself M.R. James. \u2018Verona: A Ghost Story\u2019 focuses on a young couple in the 1980s who cannot have children, but such is Ashforth\u2019s spot-on emulation of James\u2019s late Victorian/early Edwardian prose style, there\u2019s immediately a spooky dissonance. You may well be reading about a (fairly) modern couple trying and failing with IVF, but you can\u2019t fail but recognize you\u2019re in an old time ghost story. Needing a break, the couple visit Verona, where matters become swiftly spooky \u2013 in a way which has echoes of \u2018Don\u2019t Look Now\u2019 (the film, rather than the story which I\u2019ve shamefully never read), and the tale is, for the most part subtle, scary and mysterious. Unfortunately, by the end that subtlety has been kicked away to make room for something big and Hollywood, which is more than a tad disappointing. I wish Ashforth had had the courage of his convictions and kept true with James right to the end, to give us something opaque, wonderful and brilliant for not having all the answers."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11445741-simon", "userReview": "interesting well written ghostly novella.

Reminiscent of M R James and earlier Susan Hill work, the well-written prose is suitably dated and the story framed within a letter, and its response. Charles and Caroline are left devastated when their dream of starting a family is ended by the specialist's diagnosis. Charles thinks a mini break would do them good and Caroline comes up with the idea of going to Verona, totally out of the blue. Whilst there, ghostly happenings take place in the street, their hotel and a church. The unsettling atmosphere follows them home, leading Caroline to research the history of their house and family with terrifying and tragic consequences. The story is horrific and inexplicable. I'm going to bang the same drum as I bang each time I read a ghost story, however. Why does a ghost, or the presence of evil, feel the need to haunt, target, possess and destroy people who have nothing to do with whatever original tragedy caused the hauntings? The ending was very good, immensely unsettling but I was left asking Sarah \"why?\". A writer whose work I shall seek out more of - next Halloween!"}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4832722-james", "userReview": "What if an extreme evil is waiting just around the corner?

I love Benedict's mind messing style. Not jump scares but real thought provoking twisted scares. I adore the fact that he always knows how to judge the length of a book. Too short and you feel cheated. Too long and it loses its punch. These books are just right. Fantastic one sitting reading.

A good story with a semi-twist in the tale but what really shines through in Ashforth's writing is his sense of place. I could feel the sun on my face in Verona and could smell the dank mossy woods back home.I wish this author would write a longer tale."}, {"userName": "Wen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52132313-wen", "userReview": "It has a some what slow pace but that doesn\u2019t effect anything. I was gripped on this just from reading page one. Throughout the book there is a very mysterious atmosphere, which I found a familiarity from the Historian with such a similar writing style to Elizabeth Kostova. It is very well written and I must say (since I do myself know a lot about the paranormal from research) that it is very well researched. Overall the book has Steady pace, things gradually begin to occur which I do find very realistic due to the paranormal setting. When I started reading I thought it was set in the 19th century but later discovered it wasn\u2019t. As the plot unfolds I do warn it is, Very dark. If you do read this I wouldn\u2019t give up, although it\u2019s very horrific, it is worth the read. The last thing will say is that it starts off incredibly said and it ends the same but also pulls you in even more at the end. Some may find this book triggering."}], "description": "An infertile couple escape to Italy for a short break but soon understand they are not alone, and that an ancient evil has awoken.Reviews for Abbot's Keep, by the same author:\u2018Abbot\u2019s Keep is refreshing a hell.
