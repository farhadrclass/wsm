In other words, authors don\u2019t get a free pass to slack off just because they\u2019ve gone the zombie route. It\u2019s true that part of the genre\u2019s enduring appeal comes from its familiar tropes \u2013 I read the books (and watch the movies) because the stuff I\u2019m pretty certain will happen is all good, reliable fun. So while the overall story always feels familiar, the devil is in the details. If an author / filmmaker can take what\u2019s so awesome about the genre but add a twist or two that\u2019s totally new and unexpected, well then, ladies and gentlemen, what you have is a champion.David Moody has come dangerously close to outright failure on all these counts with this second installment of his Autumn series. Words cannot express how supremely disappointed I am in this book but I\u2019m gonna try. First off, this is a \u201ccompanion\u201d book, not a sequel, because it really doesn\u2019t move the story along at all, but rather re-tells the plot of Book 1, just from the perspective of a different group of survivors. Two characters from Book 1 show up again and briefly add to the action. A review here on Goodreads points out: \u201cHad you not read the 1st book in the series you could still pick this one up and start without being lost.\u201d Yeah you could, because it\u2019s essentially the same goddamn book! The only thing that prevents it from being identical is that the story is moved a smidge forward in the last few pages to set up Book 3. What could have improved things tremendously is if the two books and 600 pages had been edited down to 350 pages and one book. So, strike one.Strike two: this book is DULL. How the hell can a zombie apocalypse ever be dull? I didn\u2019t think it was possible, but there\u2019s just no fierce tension or heart-pounding action. There are some scenes running from zombies that should get the adrenaline going, but just fall flat. And for this I\u2019m really pissed because I know Moody can write awesome action sequences like nobody\u2019s business (check out Hater), and draw out the suspense until you scream Uncle. This effort just doesn\u2019t cut it. No way no how. I love zombies, and I think Moody is pretty cool, but I refuse to let this one slide, regardless of the book blurbs waxing poetic on its awesomeness and even the gushing reviews here on Goodreads. What the hell people? Have your standards dropped so low, or is that all you expect from zombie fiction these days? Strike three: I know I mentioned that \u201cdifferent\u201d or original is good, but zombies that don\u2019t bite (and continue to decay) kinda suck ass. The premise sort of intrigued me in Book 1. Moody almost had me convinced that zombies don\u2019t have to rip you up to be frightening \u2013 get enough of them and you\u2019re either smothered or crushed. But after reading another 320 pages of this kind of lurching zombie behavior, with no gore, no ripping, no biting, I\u2019m suddenly not so enamored anymore. So three strikes you\u2019re out, right? ::sigh:: I am going to read on in this series though, because I have to believe it will get better. I\u2019m also curious to see just how far Moody will take the story. So far, he\u2019s only tackled the first weeks of the apocalypse. That\u2019s the easy part to tell. The tough part is what happens next. Will he go there, and what will his post-apocalyptic world look like populated by desiccated reanimated corpses?"}, {"userName": "Greg at 2 Book Lovers Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26135818-greg-at-2-book-lovers-reviews", "userReview": "It was while I was reading The City that I heard about George Romero\u2019s passing. To be honest, it now feels like there is a massive hole in this genre that I have grown to love so much. Now, you may wonder what Romero has to do with The City or even the Autumn Series. Well, Romero set the standard, established the expectations and, whether consciously or subconsciously, Romero is the bar that all others will be judged by.I am always on the lookout for a post-apocalyptic/zombie (if you can call the Autumn Series a zombie series) book that stands out and goes somewhere different. I crave that book that brings me new emotions and feelings; a book where I. Did. Not. See. That. Coming. David Moody does this. He avoids the word zombie like the plague; although, a zombie by any other name still smells like a putrid, rotting corpse. But like any great book in the genre, it\u2019s never about them, it is about us \u2013 the survivors.Moody is a master of the human condition. Each character is unique, separate and a complete individual human. They are all part of the ensemble cast, sharing the spotlight equally. Unlike many other books where I am left with the impression that the protagonist is a reflection of how the author believes he or she would react to the apocalypse, in The City, there are as many reactions as there are characters. I am left with the image of Moody sitting in his local pub or at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 watching people, creating a story for each one. How would she react? What would that guy do? That guy there, he\u2019s going to be the arse. These characters are each given an equal platform in the story. They are my co-workers, neighbors and family. I can easily find myself in there as well.The City is billed as book two in the Autumn Series, but it runs concurrently with book one; technically you could read book two first. It is a must read for any post-apocalyptic fan."}, {"userName": "Jo Anne B", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2617828-jo-anne-b", "userReview": "3.5 starsMoody continues the series with another fast enjoyable read. I found myself having to read this one right away after I finished the first because I wanted to know what was going to happen to Michael and Emma next. The problem was that in this book we didn't even hear about Michael and Emma until Part 2 which was 47% into the book. That really bothered me. Here you have the two characters that are the heart strings of the book and you leave them out of the picture for almost half the book. The book should have picked up right away with them instead of leaving us hanging forever like that. I felt like it was a cheap ploy to keep is reading and deal with the introduction of several new characters. I didn't even like these new characters and maybe I would have been more into them if they were introduced simultaneously with Michael and Emma. Once Part 2 began, I felt like now the real story that I care about has begun.Moody does a great job making the reader feel like they are the characters in the book. Everyone is a regular person, easy to relate to, and they think and do what normal people would do in their situation. I kept thinking all throughout the first and second book, what would I do. How would I deal with that? Whereas the first book centered only on a few characters who were for the most part on their own, this book brings a whole bunch of people together. I thought that was the way it would progress in real life too. Donna kept telling Paul that they should just stay in the office building, and they both knew they had to muster up the courage to find other survivors or else they would be dead soon too. It is human nature to want to find others like yourself to be a part of a group. Michael had to convince Emma that they had to reach out to the vehicles they saw too no matter how uncomfortable or questionable it was. These people had to make hard decisions all in the hopes of making the right ones to help them survive.I did like the introduction of Cooper, Armitage, and Donna. They added some interesting perspectives to the story. I don't want to give anything away of the story line but Cooper and his gang brought a lot to this second book. I felt bad for the people that he came from and them not knowing their fate.\u00a0Donna is a kick ass independent woman whose strength and courage are admirable. She puts many of the men to shame in this book. Moody likes using the word \"idiots\" and that is how Donna saw most of the men, because they really were.The corpses once again were changing their behavior putting more pressure on the survivors to find a safe haven. Where that was exactly continued to be a big concern.After I read this one, I had to go on to the second one too, again because I was so caught up in the anticipation of it all.I strongly recommend this series. It is very enjoyable and true to human nature."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3749762-jennifer", "userReview": "I enjoyed the creep factor of \"Autumn,\" the first book in the apocalyptic Autumn series so much that I had to locate the second book. It was more than worth my time, rummaging through the shelves at Katy Budget Books. I'm totally in love with the covers for this series...so creepy...so cool!\"Autumn: the City\" tells the story of a group of survivors that witness the end of the world as we know it. But it doesn\u2019t end there, how could it? The survivors watch in horror as the once dead bodies littering the streets begin to twitch, then slowly rise up from their resting places upon the streets. As the survivors bed down in the hiding places they have found, thinking about what they should do next to stay safe, things begin to change... and not for the better.Moody stepped it up in this installment, giving the bodies a \"28 Days\" feel, which added to the overall horror. Coming in contact with the walking dead was less intense than that of the bloody savage-like zombies in \"28 Days\" but, nevertheless, scary as heck. Seeing and feeling the emotional impact of each character definitely makes you scoot to the edge of your seat and grip the book a little tighter than you would with your typical read. One thing that really makes David\u2019s walking dead more appealing than the average zombie book is that he does it in a creative way; he completely omits the use of the word 'zombie' and just tells the survivors' stories. My favorite thing about Moody\u2019s writing style is the movie theater feel. It feels as though he has written you in as an extra so you can experience the feeling to run like hell when the bodies approach. It\u2019s awesome.I highly recommend David Moody\u2019s Autumn series to anybody looking for a gnarly, zombie-apocalyptic story that will rock your world."}, {"userName": "Jodi Cleghorn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4409757-jodi-cleghorn", "userReview": "Too slow to begin, too many characters with too little depth to give two shits about. While the action picks up in the final third, it was too tedious until that point. While the Autumn series may have been ahead of the new wave of zombie novels ( like World War Z and Warm Bodies ) and probably suffers because of this ( newer books have better articulated stories and refreshing takes on the trope ) it can't excuse Moody's writing which is clinical to the point of sterile. The book suffers from too much telling and not enough showing in a third person style reminiscent of the detachment of journalism without any of the interesting things that may have been done with that approach ( World War Z ). A little like Rice's 'Interview with a Vampire' it ends without actually ending, leaving the reader with the terrible temptation to continue on with the next book despite what is likely to be an unsatisfying read. So I believe Mr Moody, this is where you and I will part company and I will ignore the fact I will never know what happens to those left stranded inside the bunker."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9126167-kate", "userReview": "II love zombie/apocalypse books and found this one in the HPB clearance area.

Anyway, I am IN! Just ordered the rest of the series because I really enjoyed this book.

We meet new characters and see how characters from the previous book are doing, as well as the introduction of the army who have been held up in a bunker just outside the city.New characters Jack, Donna and Cooper are all great, but it was also really good to get back to Emma and Michael who were my favourite characters in the first book, Autumn.What I\u2019ve found even more evident in this instalment is Moody\u2019s very cinematic writing style \u2013 it\u2019s as though each book could be an episode in a TV series and each book just gives you that little bit more of the storyline, but each having a self contained story within.There\u2019s much better characterisation in this instalment, with a lot more depth of emotion. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I began reading this straight after reading Autumn but I really started to get to know and care for the characters. The few niggles I had with Autumn weren\u2019t a factor here, and I enjoyed Autumn: The City from beginning to end.The zombies are still as creepy and now they\u2019re decomposing and getting more violent. Although these zombies are the traditional slow, shuffling kind, they are different in that they rip apart there own kind as well as humans, but don\u2019t eat flesh (well in this instalment anyway). However, this could all change as the zombies evolve further.There\u2019s fantastic tension and the suspense just builds and builds and doesn\u2019t let up. I couldn\u2019t put this book down and as soon as I\u2019d finished I grabbed for the next book in the series, Autumn: Purification.Autumn: The City is a great second instalment, much better than the first in my opinion with better characterisation and more depth. I can only see this series getting better with each book, as I follow the characters and get to know them better, as well as seeing how the zombies evolve. If you haven\u2019t started this series yet, then I would urge that you do.

One interesting aspect was that \u00a0Moody wasted no time wiping out the human population. From one minute to the next, schools, towns, cities, and then countries fell dead to an apparent virus. A second cool part of this book was how those few survivors had to \u00a0quickly come to grips with the fact that the world has ended, and that they were alive with no apparent direction to go. Michael and Emma, our heroes from book one do not show up for nearly half the book. Like the first book, the survivors are not killers. There are no kick ass zombie beheading stories, or mass killings to talk about. These books focus on what it would be like to lose everything. To lose all you ever had, ever loved, and ever dreamed.\u00a0This book adds another 40 people to the cast including up to an additional 300 soldiers that have been hiding underground in a safe self contained bunker. There are several interseting new POV's added to this book, including a cool soldier named Cooper, a nice guy widower named Jack, and a strong young woman named Donna, as well as our two original heroes, Mike and Emma.The slow building of tension and danger, coupled with the slow changes to the world, after such an incredibly fast destruction gave this book an awesome feel of dread. The changes to the undead, their evolution per se, give this book a great atmosphere. I have really enjoyed these first two books and am a fan of Moody's writing style and characterizations.

They are more aware of their surroundings and they are getting increasingly violent. We have little pockets of survivors all over; from Michael and Emma feeling hormonal in the motor home, to a larger group at the local university, a lone soldier left behind and two who came together in an office building. I love the slow build-up of this story. It seems believable. In the first book; 3/4 of the world started coughing and then died. 2-3 days later, they got back up...and now for the past 2-3 weeks they have been stumbling around trying to 'find their way'... i guess.

As in Autumn, the first book in the series, 99% of the worlds population is suddenly struck dead through what I assume to be an air born virus. The survivors must first deal with the grief of knowing that everyone they know is dead and gone. Most choose to seek comfort in the familiar by staying in their homes, or in their places of business. Eventually, they are driven out either by a desperation to ascertain that they are not the last humans alive, or because they have become trapped by the newly dead who have become zombies.Due it's location, Autumn The City lends itself to a larger cast, but once again, this does not include disabled people or GLBT people. One Asian man is at the shelter, and he does not speak any english. He is referenced once and quickly forgotten. His pain is told through the lens of a White survivor named Donna, and this further helps to remove his importance to the story. The absence of the historically marginalized people in a large urban center makes absolutely no sense and reads as a failure of imagination, as well as an inability on the part of Moody himself to confront his privilege. It's a terrible thing when one has the ability to create an entirely new world, and still cannot conceive of a way in which to include historically marginalized people. As I said in my review of Autumn, this is not unheard of in dystopian fantasy, but that fact does not make it anymore acceptable. To ensure continuity between the two books, Michael and Emma are placed on the outskirts of the city seeking shelter in a Winnebago. Due to everything that they have survived together, a sort of dependency, and what I think would best be described as situational love occurs between the two of them. The one scene I did find disturbing, is when Michael decides to masturbate to the point of ejaculation, while holding Emma as she sleeps. She of course was only feigning sleeping, and tells him that his feelings are only natural. Uh huh, to me this sounds like a great way to skirt the issue of consent, as well as justification for using a woman as a masturbatory tool.I am absolutely blown away by Moody's skill as a writer. From almost the first sentence, Autumn The City, though short - coming in at under 200 pages, is almost impossible to put down. The writing continues to be very stark, and yet we can feel the desperation of the survivors, as their only shelter becomes enclosed by dead. We can feel the fear that the world has come to the end, as a young mother jumps to her death after her baby, only minutes old, falls victim to the virus and dies. The survivors must consider whether or not to stay in the hospital, in which they have taken shelter, even though staying means risking being over run by zombies. There is also the issue that going out to find supplies, or even a new shelter, is still yet a risk. Is there any hope for these survivors? Can they fend of the depression that threatens to overwhelm them?Read More"}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5179054-ron", "userReview": "My wife brought this home from the library thinking it was something I'd like and as usual, she was spot on. This is a stronger book than the first in the series (AUTUMN), but the voice and approach are similar. It's a zombie novel set vaguely in the UK but the approach is rather original in that none of the characters express any awareness of zombies, what is going on with these creatures etc.--as though George Romero's movies (and their many spinoffs) had never set stage in popular culture. The word 'zombie' never appears in the book. I found this refreshing in that it lets the reader experience the phenomenon of something terrifying and inexplicable as the characters would, seeking answering and trying to puzzle things out. I also like the way Moody handles the 'phases' of the zombie process, a way that has the reader speculating as much as the characters, when or if the other shoe will fall. I was 40 pages into the story before realizing that it was written in omniscient point of view, a rarity these days. This creates a distance from the characters, almost as though we're studying them as detached scientific observers. This pretty much suits the author's purpose, I surmise. The characters seem real and are not necessarily likeable, but that's OK. They behave much more like real humans and not at all like their movie stereotypes. At times it felt more like a literary novel than sf/horror. It's definitely a departure from the typical munch & march/guts & guns teen zombie genre and well worth a look for horror/sf fans."}, {"userName": "Dreadlocksmile", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2075479-dreadlocksmile", "userReview": "\u201cAutumn: The City\u201d is the second book of the four part post-apocalyptic zombie saga by David Moody.

Like in the first novel, the events quickly take off, with the desperate situation throwing the few survivors left into a complete state of shock. The novel homes in on there emotional responses and the mental stress each and every character is put under. David weaves a dark tale of tension and uncertain suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning.

The story climbs towards a dramatic ending that will leave you gasping once you\u2019ve finished.David show\u2019s a great talent with his writing, keeping the reader absorbed in the tale and feeling emotionally attached to the unfortunate survivors.

In the last quarter of the book the story meets up with where the original Autumn ended (although you won't have needed to read it, since the events have all recompiled in this book). At the end of The City you are presented with no closure, ensuring that you'll continue with the series. That all said, you probably will continue with it. Despite the lack of originality, the repetitive plot, the two dimensional characters, and no memorable scenes - there is a spark in Moody's Autumn series that cannot be dulled.

I enjoyed it, perhaps not as much as I was hoping, but the way that David Moody told a bleak and eerie tale struck a chord with me and I knew that I would have to get around to the sequel when it came out. Well, out it came in January and here I am a few months down the line finally getting around to it! I may not have been in the same surrounding to read Autumn: The City, but not only did I enjoy it more than the first book, I found that it gave me more chills too. Not good while reading it during the early hours of the morning at home, alone...Autumn: The City starts in much the same way as the first book, Autumn, although a short prologue shows that at least some people knew that it was coming as an army unit is ordered to move to a secure bunker, just making it inside in time. From there we follow a handful of people as others around them die suddenly and the world changes in an instant, with very few surviving the event. We see these individuals dealing with life in the aftermath, trying to survive and seek out other survivors, and finally grouping together at the local university. But the cadavers have changed and are no longer simply stumbling around, the new aggression they show can mean nothing good for the survivors. And then there is the army, coming out from its bunker to see what state the world is in, and finding it worse than even they imagined.Unlike the first novel Moody doesn't take his time in exploring the death event and the immediate aftermath, from mass death to the re-animation of the corpses, in too great detail, but instead does all of this in a smoother and quicker fashion. We still get a good look at how these people are trying to cope and survive, but it isn't a day-by-day thing, more of a general look at their lives over a longer period - it works much better as it doesn't bog the story down in mundane and boring events. This has a knock-on effect to the story as Moody has covered the time period of the first novel by the time we reach the half-way point, and then we get into new and more interesting territory, seeing how the behaviour of the dead changes as more time passes. It also allows him to follow up on the fates of Michael and Emma from the first book who make a welcome return to the story, keeping that story thread going.Other than these two returning characters there are quite a few more to follow. With a few dozen holed up at the university Moody is able to select those that we follow, and each brings something different to the story. Moody uses the characters to great effect in Autumn: The City, telling the story through their eyes and their reactions as things start to changed. It works well, but I didn't find that any particular character stood out for me, rather they all had interesting stories and acted in a way I would expect. I was slightly annoyed by the two young men who wanted to find a pub/club and have one final night on the town, but when the end of the world comes I'm sure there will be people like that about.Story-wise there really isn't too much I could tell you that you won't have seen from lots of zombie movies that are out there, but Moody has a talent for making you feel part of events. The descriptions he uses can be chilling and eerie, completely vivid and all too real. The novel does end rather abruptly, and it's one of the main issues I had with it. Autumn was fairly self-contained, but this sequel is clearly written as part of a larger story, one I'm very much looking forward to reading.Autumn: The City is a step up from the first book and a novel I very much enjoyed. While many zombie stories tend to follow a similar path David Moody has shown that just because the idea is old it doesn't mean it can't be re-told, and in this case with great success!"}, {"userName": "Rewies", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48591476-rewies", "userReview": "En la misma linea que el primero, con un poco mas de acci\u00f3n.

The original is not required to read prior to this but might be helpful as towards the end of this novel, two characters from the first book make an appearance. The premise is the same; an unknown biological virus wipes out 99% of the world\u2019s population in minutes. Autumn: The City hints in the prologue that whatever caused the mass deaths might be a known viral/bio agent or someone knew it was going to be released as there is some preparation that takes place prior to the first chapter. Autumn: The City is pretty much a retelling of the original book only with new characters. This book again tells the story of several survivors as they deal with people dying and dropping like flies all around them. For some reason as yet unexplained, they seem to be unaffected by this mass die off and are left to fend for themselves. However, they apparently have no idea what the 3 primary rules are for any disaster. Rule 1) Get out of the cityRule 2) Get out of the cityRule 3) Get out of the cityNow with that in mind, we follow the storyline as a larger cast of characters are introduced, some quickly forgotten, as they attempt to hold out at a University and the adjoining medical center while making scavenging runs into the city itself. This leads to some clich\u00e9d encounters with the infected as to be expected but the action sequences seemed a little bit forced and not edge of your seat type thrills or suspense.What makes this story slightly different than the original is that there is a larger cast of characters the reader finally gets a little more insight into their background and motivation. New to the sequel is the introduction of a military response in the form of what is mentioned in the prologue. This time it\u2019s a small squad of soldiers that are sent out in an APC possibly a Saracen or similar type vehicle as they are supposed to be UK troops, and 2 of the group gets separated. One soldier survives and appears to be immune to whatever caused the deaths while the other one dies as soon as exposed. What is again lacking within this work are the details, those little insights and descriptions that flesh out a novel. More of what the internal struggle would be for a person thrown into this type of situation. The action throughout is fast, quickly described then we move onto something else. While the action is well within the first chapter and continuing all the way through, it reads as almost forced and lacking substance in regards to enthralling the reader with intense sequences. As in the first novel, any secondary characters introduced remain one dimensional and mostly in the background.Overall, Autumn: The City is another page turner like its predecessor, it will keep the reader involved in the storyline, but is a quick read that is put aside for novels in the genre that have a bit more substance."}, {"userName": "David McDonald", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8076543-david-mcdonald", "userReview": "Taking into account how much I enjoyed David Moody's Autumn, a post-apocalyptic tale of the walking dead in the UK, I was genuinely concerned about whether its sequel Autumn: The City, would measure up, especially in the knowledge that after this sequel, there are still a number of titles remaining in the Autumn series...Although a sequel, Autumn: The City runs almost concurrently to the timeline of Autumn and introduces us to further characters within the universe that Moody has created as well as some familiar survivors from the first instalment in the series. This is not to say that this work is simply a recap or indeed treading old ground; in fact, I would suggest that Autumn: The City is quite different to its predecessor. This difference is not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination and to my mind, is akin to the difference between Ridley Scott's Alien and James Cameron's Aliens; the former being a claustrophobic, atmospheric horror and the latter being an action horror of superior calibre. That is not to say that Autumn: The City can simply be pigeon-holed as such.Again, Moody is in no rush to tell his story; and this addition to his Autumn universe sees a larger group and how they are coping with the undead menace baying at their doors...As in Autumn, Moody's undead continue to evolve much to the alarm of his protagonists. Along with their evolution comes the inevitable degradation of their physical state, which the author narrates incredibly effectively with his compelling prose which is quite graphic when describing decaying, diseased flesh. As opposed to Autumn, Moody does not spend as much time in The City dealing with the immediate aftermath of the unspecified pandemic and moves his story along from the time period occupied by Autumn.I always try to be as objective as possible when considering books and an issue that I always try and deal with when tackling a sequel is whether or not the book can stand alone. This is a difficult matter with Autumn: The City, since it occupies the same timeline as its predecessor and so, yes, I would suggest that Autumn: The City, can be read without any knowledge of Autumn. However, I am of the opinion that the reader's experience will only be enhanced by reading the novels in the sequence in which the author intended. I have read books out of turn before and regretted it. Learn from my mistakes!Like its predecessor, Autumn: The City is a short, punchy read at sub 300 pages; is very well-written and it will take you no time at all to consume; and with the knowledge that there are further books in the Autumn series to read, Autumn: The City admirably advances Moody's tale of post-apocalyptica and the walking dead and has an ending left wide-open for the next title in the series."}, {"userName": "Scott Callaway", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4609437-scott-callaway", "userReview": "The thought of a zombie apocalypse for me is the scariest horror scenario that could ever happen. Autumn: The City brings out all the fear and dread that surrounds this unlikely happening and like a slow rise it consistently builds up the tension with every chapter. Bringing a fresh perspective to the the traditional zombie story, Autumn: The City delivers delightfully.This is the second book in the Autumn series and although I have not read the first book, due to this being given to me by a friend to read, I had no problem enjoying the story. The author did an amazing job depicting how the city had gone to waste with each passing day since the disease had spread. Something I really enjoyed about this fresh approach to the zombie story is that he gave it a bit originality, even though it's hard to make any zombie story somewhat original anymore because they are basically all the same. Not every person who died had risen again and there was an evolution to the behavior of the walking dead. The book never once use the word \"zombie\", although a phrase in the book did reveal that the idea was not foreign to the world, and there wasn't any pointless gore for the sake of there being gore.My favorite bit about this book was the raw human emotion that the author did amazing at expressing - fear, anger, emptiness, confusion, longing, etc... Every character displayed their emotions differently than others and it was all very compelling and believable. The book was all about expressing the struggle of the survivors and how they tried to come to terms with it. I definitely could appreciate that because a lot of zombie anything these days rely heavily on gruesome acts such as flesh eating and gore. There was plenty of decay and descriptions of rot and smell, but that only helped depict the scenery and the horror of the survivors.The book was easy to read, the writing was vivid, the emotion excellent and the build up intense. Each character portrayed were believable and the walking dead were creepy and progressively more frightening. This book is definitely intended for mature readers due to its nature and for its coarse language. But if you are a fan of zombie stories then I highly suggest reading this book."}, {"userName": "Cathy/The Crazy Bookworm", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2455168-cathy-the-crazy-bookworm", "userReview": "\" You're all I've got left.

Autumn: The City is the second book in the four part saga. After reading the first book, Autumn, I was immediately hooked. David Moody has an incredible writing style and knows how to bring the horror and the suspense in full force. He also introduces fascinating characters that you will be rooting for throughout the whole book. As a big fan of Michael and Emma from Autumn I was pleased that they made a return in this book and was curious to see if and how they would mesh with the other survivor's. It is hard to review this book without giving away spoilers. Short and sweet...This book is awesome! I love Zombie books, stories and movies, but David Moody brings it all on a completely different level. He knows how to deliver a haunting scenario and knows how to get the goosebumps to rise. There is a perfect balance between the very well told story, and the captivating characters. Like the first book, the intensity and suspense is almost unbearable. You'll be flying though the pages. I can't wait to get my hands on book 3 and to see how the story unfolds. David Moody has made it onto my favourite author's list and the Autumn Series is definitely on my favourite books list! The Autumn series should not be missed!

I received Autumn: The City for Christmas, so I can finally review the second book after that huge cliffhanger ending. Unfortunately this time the focus isn\u2019t on Emma and Michael. Yes, they do appear, but it\u2019s toward the end and they play a very, very minor role. I wasn\u2019t really expecting that at all, so my perception of The City is very likely skewed.I have a lot of respect for David Moody. Why? Because throughout all 330 pages of The City he maintains constant suspense. And I mean constant as in suspense from page 1 to page 330. Part of it is the simplistic yet very effective writing style that focuses not only on the characters, but what is going on outside of their shelter in the city. Another part is the fact that the premise of the whole Autumn series is absolutely terrifying: you see 99% of the people around you die a terribly agonizing death and are all alone until the corpses start getting up and regain their basic senses like rage, thus making them want to kill you. I don\u2019t know about you, but I personally would not want to live in a world like that, where every noise you make can attract millions of decaying, violent corpses.This time around the main characters didn\u2019t really stand out for me, except for Cooper. David Moody followed the lives of several people, but none of them seemed special or even particularly interesting. Cooper, sadly, only comes in about two thirds of the way through. At least he makes some sort of an impression, unlike the others.At least now the story of how the plague started and what the heck it is may come out in the next book because the military is involved somehow. Interesting\u2026I give this book 3.5/5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars for Goodreads rating purposes."}, {"userName": "Katie Kenig", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/841891-katie-kenig", "userReview": "When I started this book, so quickly after finishing the first in the Autumn series, my first thoughts were \"Oh, no - Where's Emma??? Where's Michael??!! I wasn't expecting to start over at the beginning of the disaster, just in another area of the country. \"Meanwhile, back at the ranch...\" is what I call that kind of book in a series, and it is one of the reasons I sometimes find myself turning up my nose at serial fiction (along with the repetitive, over-explanatory nature of sequels that continually re-hash old events to inform those just tuning in).At any rate, you finally catch up with Michael and Emma about halfway through the book, when the timeline in the city reaches where they were on their flight from the farmhouse during the first book. Whew. I was almost ready to give up on the series, but again, there is something about these books that I can't quite explain that draws me in and doesn't let go.I kind of love the fact that not a single character in these books - nor the author, at least not so far - ever utters the word \"Zombie\". It's so obvious. If I was in this situation, with dead people trying to break into my shelter to get to me, I would certainly proclaim that they were zombies. Somehow, though, it never comes up. Even when they ask each other what is going on. It had to take a lot of willpower for the author to keep true to this one, and I am going to be keeping my eye on it in future books, to see if it ever comes up.Another thing I kind of love about these books is that the people are reacting in real ways. Not everyone is a hero. Some people lock themselves up alone with their grief. Some give up and turn to suicide or drinking themselves to death. Some are heroes, but reluctantly, because there doesn't seem to be any other option at the moment. It's gritty and real and made me get up at one point, around 2 in the morning, to double check that that sound outside my bedroom window wasn't a dead guy trying to get in."}, {"userName": "Erica Gilliam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11676166-erica-gilliam", "userReview": "I am a big zombie fan so this book had me hooked immediately. Autumn: the city is the second book of the series and I think it is just as good as the first book, Autumn. Being the hopeless romantic that I am, I keep waiting for a more intimate connection between some of the characters and it really hasn't happened yet. It's actually rather interesting that there is no love connection thus far. It almost makes it more realistic. Most movies and books include the romance for the audience, but when it really comes down to it, I don't believe being in love would be the first thing on your mind. However, a love connection may appear before the series is through which would be fine by me too! Either way, I am enjoying the series so far. The only thing that I don't really like is there is no personal connection from character to reader with any of the characters (at least I don't think there is). What I mean is that if any of the characters died, I would not feel any real personal loss because I have no attachment to any of the characters. As of yet the nurturing sides of the characters haven't come out nor do I really know any history of any of the characters which makes it easy to not become attached. David Moody may be using this for the next books or maybe it's just not his style of writing, I don't know. This is one of the big reasons I did not give it 5 stars though. The way the author expresses the scenes is perfect to make me visualize myself being there and in that situation, however, I think more descriptions of the characters and their backgrounds would help bring the visualizing more to life."}, {"userName": "Alyce Hunt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6454474-alyce-hunt", "userReview": "When I finished 'Autumn', the first book in David Moody's series of the same name, I was excited to continue onwards. I loved Michael and Emma, the survivors that we were following, and I was looking forward to seeing what happened to them over the course of the series.This meant I was a little bit dismayed when I started 'Autumn: The City' and discovered that we were following a whole host of new characters. Starting in much the same way as the first book, we join our new characters on the day that the world ends and we follow them as they find other survivors and eventually team together in a large group.This novel is split into two parts, and I did feel as though Part One dragged ridiculously slowly. Because we'd already experienced the first two weeks of the end of the world, it didn't seem worth reliving it - a lot of it felt like repetition of the first book (setting fires to contact other survivors, working out how to get supplies etc.). I understand that we needed more characters (following Michael and Emma again would have been limiting) but it would have been nice if we'd joined them when they were all already together, rather than meeting them all individually to start with. It was probably to make you feel more connected to the characters, but because there were so many of them I didn't feel emotionally attached anyway: I would have preferred to jump straight into the action.However, Part Two is much more interesting.Read the rest of my review here!"}], "description": "Everything that means anything to you is taken away in seconds.
