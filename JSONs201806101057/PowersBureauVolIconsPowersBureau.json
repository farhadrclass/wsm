Same core style - capital-S style - and in this volume I'm noticing him add elements to the edges of the pages that aren't strictly necessary to advance the strory. Beakers lined along a page with scientists, an out-of-context sexual picture that might represent a flashback or a warped memory, but goes unexplained. Weird, leaving me feel slightly off-Center, and *that* is the best way to engage me a little deeper.Oeming's further a master of the unusual and visually interesting camera angles. No one does overhead shots like this guy, or can make battle scenes seem as action-y and exciting as him. I was flipping pages through this book like a crazed madman, especially as the trouble heated up. And man does shit heat up here. I fucking love this series. Walker/Millenium is *not* doing well, and the secret forces around him aren't exactly giving him a break.Story ends on a great change moment, and I can't wait for more of this. Can I confess something here, my fellow shallow readers? Are we alone? OK good. Deena. Freaking. Pilgrim. Hot. Bitter, angry, chip-on-her-shoulder-a-mile-long hot. That attitude, as much as anything else about this book, keeps me coming back for more. In my youth I would've pursued this woman until my hands bled. Well, come to think of it there were a couple of women in college who probably wished I never heard of them, and they both had unattainable attitudes like this.

The individual issue release schedule is so irregular that trying to collect this in issues just didn't make sense anymore. The story is good, but I swear that Oeming's art seems to be devolving--there are pages here that look like the work of a kindergartner, and not in a good way.

I am genuinely surprised at how this TPB is rated on average.If your tastes run in the vein of Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Invincible, and other long-running series that never seem to die, but also aren't covering any new ground, then I can see enjoying this volume. Otherwise, the most interesting characters at this point have been killed, and the ones that remain aren't growing in any way that should keep your attention. I don't see any reason to keep reading beyond habit and/or loyalty, like if you've hated The Walking Dead for three whole seasons but can't seem to stop yourself.Pilgrim and Walker aren't really blurring the lines between good and evil at this point. They're out and out murderers, which makes it hard to care that they're taking down criminals who definitely haven't done as much harm, or have nearly identical motivations (but not the badges), or occasionally (arguably worse?) villains. Sunrise is a barely developed paper doll of a character, with just enough banter and glimpses of her family life to keep her from disappearing in the space between panels. Everyone else is so thin I often have to Google search what the last issue they appeared in was so I can go back and refresh my memory.The only redeeming storyline since the (most recent) end of the Wolfe/Walker struggle, Calista becoming the new Retro Girl, is barely a thread. I'd trade two single issues of the relationship between her and Walker being developed more as she trains to become a hero and perhaps even learns how disillusioning it can be over the entire two TPB volumes of the Bureau. The gaps between the end of her storyline and the \"All New Powers\" arc is so jarring and incomplete I had to reread both volumes to make sure I wasn't missing anything. It's just not there.If the last volume you read between one of the many hiatuses was volume 7: Forever or Volume 8: Legends, and you feel at all satisfied with the closure those issues presented, I'd recommend not reading any more and keeping that nostalgia of how good the run was up to that point. Beyond that, where many series start to sag around the 50-60 issue mark, is just an endless cycle of alternately giving powers to damn near everyone (and subsequently taking them away), losing sight of how the most interesting aspect of the series has always been the distance your two favorite (and powerless) characters provided from the chaos and sometimes wonder of the Powers world.Skim through for threads of Calista's story, and try not to let your eyes glaze over the filler in between. Somewhere along the line this turned into the Ballad of Vegeta and a veritable assembly line of exploded bodies fit for a Pollock canvas. There's no soul in the pages anymore."}, {"userName": "Timo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1519165-timo", "userReview": "What a fun ride this was, really huge fun.Such high in drama, so fast paced, so violent.

One of the new TV shows is Powers, based on Bendis and Oeming\u2019s acclaimed independently owned property (albeit published by Marvel\u2019s imprint, Icon, but it\u2019s not part of the Marvel Universe).Throughout its run its managed to distinguish itself as a gritty, often brutal police drama where the two lead characters are tasked with dealing with powers-related crimes. The two cops in question are Christian Walker, and ex-superhero who we learn through flashbacks is exceptionally long-lived, and Deena Pilgrim, who now has plenty of experience under her belt since first partnering up with Walker.At this point in the story Walker and Pilgrim have began working for the FBI since a rather serious incident two books ago made all powers-related incidents federal crimes. However, on just the second book of the Powers Bureau series (the other books are just under the title \u2018Powers\u2019) all of that appears to be at risk. A young superhero team have been murdered and a \u201890\u2019s second-rate hero is being served up as the culprit, but Walker and Pilgrim aren\u2019t convinced. Something bigger is going on within the FBI and they\u2019ve just wandered right into the middle of it.The superhero team and the hero set-up as the fall guy are loosely based on Rob Liefeld\u2019s \u201890\u2019s run on X-force, and Bendis and Oeming do poke a bit of fun, and perhaps rightly so if you\u2019ve ever read it. Not that you need to know any of that to enjoy the book. It is, first and foremost, about having to investigate crimes when the criminals have the added advantage of being invisible, telepathic, or as in one case in this book, able to make multiple versions of themselves. Bendis and Oeming like nothing more than taking the idea and running with it, spinning out unexpected directions while not being afraid to utterly shake up the status quo. Characters aren\u2019t safe just because you like them, and territory is well and truly explored that other comics wouldn\u2019t dare go near - one of the advantages of being creator-owned. Oeming\u2019s art style is bold and loose, and appears much more cartoony than most superhero comics, while his clever use of black makes for a shadowy noir world of shadows and secrets. On the writing front Bendis is pretty much the king of the snappy dialogue, with the two leads constantly trading short, punchy exchanges, although you should be warned that the book is incredibly sweary and punctuated by expletives throughout. Half the time it\u2019s a much truer reflection of people under pressure, but sometimes you just want to reach into the panel and suggest they calm it down a bit.It is a first class crime drama, though, and an obvious choice for adapting for TV, so if you\u2019re after something a little more adult then you won\u2019t go far wrong with Powers."}, {"userName": "Trike", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2135825-trike", "userReview": "This came in the mail yesterday afternoon and I read it right away. That's how much I like this series. I've been following it since the first TPB and have enjoyed it immensely.There are a number of similar books out there concerning worlds populated with superheroes just as a matter of course, but the only real standouts for me are Astro City and Powers. Top 10 is great, don't get me wrong, but there are only three of them.In this particular collection we learn that there is some sort of super-Illuminati pulling the strings behind the scenes, something that has been hinted at a couple times in the past. However, beyond that confirmation and the return appearance of the \"advanced alien civilization\" known as The Millennium, none of the plot threads introduced in Powers: Bureau, Vol. 1: Undercover were resolved. Zero.And that makes me nervous.Mainly because unlike any of the other collections, this one concludes with a giant \"THE END\" on the last page. I asked Bendis on Twitter if more issues were coming, and I hope the answer is a big fat Yes because I loves me some Powers. Ending it on a cliffhanger would be uncool.That said, the characteristic witty banter between Walker and Pilgrim is on full display, which is at least half the reason to show up. It seemed less acerbic this time; more like the habitual sarcastic oneupsmanship of good friends than the biting defense mechanism we've seen in earlier issues. They've seen some shit and know the other has their back, so there's no meanness there.Supposedly the TV series is finally a go on the Playstation, which means I won't be able to see it for years, which is why I hope Bendis and Oeming continue this book.Edit: Bendis just replied to my tweet - more Powers on the way! I'm stoked, brah.Here's the image I tweeted to him:"}, {"userName": "Shannon Appelcline", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10160415-shannon-appelcline", "userReview": "This finale to the short-lived Bureau comic feels unfortunately anticlimactic. I mean this volume closes up plots going back to Powers, Vol. 4: Supergroup, but still manages to feel like it came out of nowhere. It seems like what should have been a 30- or 36-issue run suddenly got smoothed down to 12, and so we're out of the FBI as soon as we got in.With that said, there's quite a lot to like in this comic. The smaller procedural that kicks things off is a lot of fun, then the big one that ends things is shockingly violent as it combines together a couple of major plots. It's nicely done and the ending is dramatic and traumatic. Classic (if somewhat repetitive) Powers.The problem is that Powers' schedule seems to have gone completely off the rails. It took years to get these two volumes of Bureau out and then years to follow-up on it with Volume 3. That's probably why things got suddenly finished up here and everything shuffled on to a new path \u2014\u00a0one that also fit better with the then-upcoming (now-cancelled) TV show. But, all of that's badly impact the Powers comic, which is just about dead at this point (unless v3 actually manages to bring back the reliability that we haven't seen in years)."}, {"userName": "Scott Lee", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4284112-scott-lee", "userReview": "It's not the best Powers volume ever, but it is excellent, Oeming's work felt even darker and rougher than normal here, but given the place this story is going it feels appropriate. Bendis still handles the elements of the genre and the dialogue with his usual excellence. What makes this one so appealing to me is it's promise of an epic confrontation to come. The scope of this story envelopes the entire series in a way even Walker's origin fails to do. Granted Walker's origin story is more epic in scope in that it covers a much greater span of time, but while it's all relevant to Walker, and it's all relevant to that arc, it's not a make you reconsider every panel of every issue epic. For the comic itself this arc--it appears will span a few volumes--could be the best of the entire series(es)."}, {"userName": "Alex Sarll", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5866774-alex-sarll", "userReview": "This cops and capes series has been all over the place for too long, sometimes barely releasing an issue a year, or meandering when it did come out, all suggesting a loss of commitment from the creators to the extent that I abandoned reading it in singles. But for all that a lot of Bendis' other work has been erratic lately, this volume's not bad at all, tying together various long-running strands in a tale of powers, corruption and lies that you could only pull off in a superhero comic at once very long-running, and creator-owned. Oeming's page layouts in particular feel more experimental than ever (and generally successful experiments, too), and before the story proper gets going there's a wonderfully nasty little done-in-one investigation."}, {"userName": "Marissa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50656-marissa", "userReview": "It is so nice to have new Powers comics again after Bendis and Oeming took a break to focus on the tv show that never was, although now I hear the project is actually going to be happening for real this time.
