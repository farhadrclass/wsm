Reuben does a wonderful job creating the world around her two main characters Gustav and Rebecca. At times the book was a little confusing because it would jump from past to present and vice versa and the voice of the author was not always clearly present but, overall the characters from A Beautiful Cage were entertaining and memorable. I especially loved Gustav's grandmother and the touch of German words included within the chapters made the story all the more real. A Beautiful Cage is a touching and beautiful reminder of extraordinary love in extraordinary circumstances. If you enjoy reading historical romances than I highly recommend A Beautiful Cage!"}, {"userName": "Jessica Ruben", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8032231-jessica-ruben", "userReview": "It was a fantastic story that was beautiful and heart breaking. It's a 4.5 but I rounded up. I just wish there was more character development and a longer story.

The atrocities of mob-mentality sparked by Hitler create a setting for this historical romance.Rebecca Bloomberg, the pretty, intelligent, outgoing daughter of a Jewish banker, lives a life of privilege until Nazism creeps in taking away her family, friends, money, home and everything until she is alone, vulnerable and despised as one of what Hitler labeled an inferior race of people. She is fair game to be raped and defiled if caught out on the streets. To keep from starving, she ventures into the street, is attacked, but wakes up in a nice, comfortable German home. She is conflicted but grateful to be alive.Gustavo von Furst, the man Rebecca labeled a gorgeous blond giant the first time she saw him, wears a swastika and greets others with \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d. He leads a double mysterious life that is fraught with danger. However, he brings Rebecca, the girl he\u2019d lusted for from afar, to his grandmother Bertie\u2019s home knowing the danger he puts them all in. Rebecca\u2019s sojourn with Gustav and his grandmother creates a story that transports and grips one\u2019s emotions in most unusual ways. What is morally right and what is lawfully right becomes a big issue--just how much is one willing to risk to save another person. Rebecca, who feels guilty for what she is putting her rescuers through, feels like she is in a \u201cBeautiful Cage\" because showing herself even at a window could bring torture and death to them all\u2014but she craves the sun, fresh air, freedom.The double agents, unsure alliances and clandestine doings keep the reader\u2019s heart rate at top speed much of the time. Many of the secondary characters like those who frequent Martin\u2019s Bar and the secretive Dietrich keep the reader guessing. However, the most compelling of the secondary characters are those in the back stories within the main story. They add depth, intrigue, and heartbreaking details. The true history woven into the story makes it seem real.Alyson Reuben\u2019s compelling, beautiful, heartfelt writing style brings to life a time in history that changed the world while she weaves in an incredible, forever love story of a disenfranchised Jewish girl and her gorgeous blond giant. Their love disregards ethnic borders and wins against tremendous odds to bring them to their happy-ever-after (with a special bonus) far from the misery they had endured. A BEAUTIFUL CAGE is a memorable story."}, {"userName": "Got Romance!

The book highlights the fact that there was a resistance movement in Germany during the War and it touches on a relationship that crosses religious and social boundaries. The story starts with a flashback of a beautiful young, Jewish, bankers daughter named Rebecca running directly into the definition of an Aryan male named Gustav. She is embarrassed and wants nothing to do with the large man, whereas he would like nothing more than to lose himself in her if he beauty. Rebecca quickly walks away hoping to forget the man and move on with her life. Gustav wonders if he\u2019ll ever forget her. Fast forward to the night of Kristnacht in Berlin when the Jewish people are thoughtlessly rounded up and arrested. Rebecca has lost her family and her fianc\u00e9 and has had nothing to eat for days. She knows that she must run and after packing a bag she escapes from her apartment. It doesn\u2019t take long for a few thugs to start following her. Luckily Gustav hears her cry out and steps in. He takes her to his home which he shares with his Grandmother Berite and so begins a love story that will make you both laugh and cry. I loved this book.

The story is full of suspense and kept me turning the pages wanting to know what was going to happen next. Rebecca Bloomberg, whose loved ones have been taken from her and sent to a concentration camp, is a gutsy young woman the reader can immediately sympathize with. She\u2019s thrust into a way of life that forces her to trust the one man she shouldn\u2019t \u2013 Gustav Von Furst, a man she believes supports the Nazi cause. Though she tries to keep her distance, circumstances forces them into close proximity, leading her to see the man behind the fa\u00e7ade.Gustav Von Furst is a man determined to do what\u2019s right even if it could cost him everything he holds dear including his own life. He works undercover as a Nazi journalist while helping the English government. Due to the very nature of his work, he is suspicious of nearly everyone he meets, questioning if friends and acquaintances are just that or something more sinister. The fact that he is willing to risk everything to do what\u2019s right makes him a hero to root for and to fall in love with.It is apparent from the very beginning Alyson Reuben has done a great deal of research into the time period. Both Rebecca and Gustav are well written characters that had me wanting them to get their happily ever after from the very start. The nail biting suspense, encounters between Rebecca and Gustav, and the perilous situation in general make this a must read. I can\u2019t wait for Alyson\u2019s next book."}, {"userName": "Mimi Barbour", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3576355-mimi-barbour", "userReview": "Nazi Germany in Berlin in 1934 is the setting used in \"The Beautiful Cage\" and tends to explain, somewhat, the premise of the plot \u2013 as does the title. However, the skill woven throughout each page captured my full attention, allowing me to live in the heart-wrenching moments this poor Jewish girl experienced, fearing for her life. From the author's first description of her hero and heroine to the very end of the story, she kept me enthralled with the love growing and encircling Rebecca and Gustav. Ms. Reuben's incredible talent is highlighted in wonderful sentences such as: Life was an accordion that made sickening sour notes as it hit the ground bursting into pieces.The German phrases interspersed throughout the book added an authenticity and the secondary characters were well done. Personally having travelled to Amsterdam where I toured Ann's Frank's house, I had a slight insight into the horrors of that time, but this book put it in a much closer context. The writing was so good that I experienced the emotions and fear right along with Rebecca. I give this book five stars and would give it more if they were available. Please hurry with your next book, Ms. Reuben, because your name is now on my favourites list.

I had just read All the Light We Cannot See and The Nightingale. Those were excellent books set during WWII, and I was interested in reading another book set during WWII. I also was looking for a book that had a more central love story. Unfortunately, what I got in A Beautiful Cage was a book that was not very well written and whose love scenes read like a romance novel. I was not looking for the latter, and, even if you are, there are better choices out there. The dialogue is stale and unrealistic, and the descriptions do not engage because the language is rather trite. I did make it through the whole book as it was a very easy read, but it didn't offer the depth and richness I was looking for. This book may have suffered a little from comparisons to the books I had just read, but I don't think that affected my rating too much."}, {"userName": "Loederkoningin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4878104-loederkoningin", "userReview": "I usually like to avoid works by authors who feel the need to skew the ratings by smugly, cringe-worthily rating their own work 5 stars (TWICE!), but it's a rec from my bestie so here I go."}, {"userName": "Jill Goldstein", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14729087-jill-goldstein", "userReview": "Oh, please....don't even bother with this book. I love historical fiction and found this version very lame. The love story that took over the entire plot was not even believable. I'm not a prude, but the amount of sex in the book did not add to the story or the character development. A poor attempt at a mystery within the plot fell rather short. And I hate to be picky, but I think the editor/author missed a few points...in two consecutive paragraphs, money is refered to as a mark and then a dollar. Well, which one? The reference to The Night of Long Knives was written as The Long Night of Knives.

I thought they rounded each other out very well. In the uncertain and dangerous times they were in, their romance shown all the more. While the romantic stuff was sweet and all, I felt the author had way too much of a reliance on sex to further the story and illustrate their romance. I felt like these two didn't interact before the clothes were flying and moans were filling the air. Maybe a little more conversation and relationship building and less explicit swapping of spit...I also enjoyed the dual story lines of hiding Rebecca and Gustave's Resistance activities. I was kept on the edge of my seat more than once, waiting to see if this person would see Rebecca out of hiding or that person following Gustave would get him or not. I only wished that the author might have combined the story lines more. More than once, I felt like I was reading two different novels but with the same characters. Despite that, I loved the tension and suspense of the storyline. The author kept me guessing more than once on people's motivations and who was an ally/enemy.Sweet romance, edge-of-your-seat Resistance stuff, and hiding a Jew in Nazi Germany, all of this leads to a enjoyable read. If only the glaring explicit sex scenes and dual story lines didn't muck it up... In the end, I've got to go with a 3 for the entire read. While I enjoyed the story and characters, way too much sex and flip-flopping plot threads left me a bit cold in the end."}, {"userName": "A", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13739848-a", "userReview": "4.5 stars.

I loved the main characters, it's rare in romance books these days that I don't hate at least one of them - one of the main characters, the hero's grandmother, was probably my favourite.Since it's set during WW2 involving a Jewish woman and German man involved in the Nazi regime in some facet, it's not a feel good romance but it's written in a way that you can't stop reading.
