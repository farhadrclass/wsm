I\u2019d barely had time to recover from Elsbeth Wyght\u2019s vicious game when the call from Detective Haskins came. This time a bank robbery with a difference... and of course nothing as it seemed. With this turn of events I found myself thrust onto a shadowy trail that would lead me back to the asylum of my deepest nightmares and a desperate hunt for the truth amid a growing, cataclysmic danger. Add to the mix an engineered virus threatening to turn half the city to zombies, a trip into a world straight out of a Grimm's fairy tale, and a vicious, demonic conspiracy that would make the Silver Spiral\u2019s plans seem like a cakewalk. And always, just below the surface, my dark other. Stirring, plotting, waiting. But for what? Now, as the dead of winter looms, the vampires and demons of the Dark City are growing more restless than ever as they wait for the Shade to return. The evil force that brought hell to my city. The Shadow in the mirror. The Ender of Worlds.
