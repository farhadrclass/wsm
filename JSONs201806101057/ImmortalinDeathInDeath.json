Things between Eve and Roarked changed in such a raw yet endearing way. Eve laid herself bare at Roarkes feet and it broke my heart to listen to her tell her dark story. Pieces had been revealed but in the moment where she let it all out I was moved.Roarke had sat quietly fighting his anger for what she went through and just listened. With just a gentle touch from him Eve knew she had finally made it out of the dark. He would absorb her pain and simply love her. I have said it before but it is worth repeating. I love how he loves her. And here is thing. Don\u2019t mistake him for being a sappy guy. He is dangerous and fierce.Things hit close to home when Eve is faced again with a murder. There are few that she considers family so when her girlfriend Mavis is named one of the prime suspect Eve finds it hard staying within the lines. Drugs and immortality is something that runs wild within the circles of high fashion and the glamorous people who live within it. Someone is willing to kill for it.This author continues to do a great job with slowly building who Eve and Roarke are individually and together. And she continues to add additional side characters that are weaved into the story so that you know they will be sticking around for a while. Leonardo and Peabody are the two that grew on me in this one. Feeney, Mavis, Summerset and the Commander continue to shine. I\u2019m beginning to see another side of Summerset and I am intrigued. I quite enjoyed this one and yes I have moved on to book 4. With the way that J.D.

Weird, huh? Also in the future, women in authority will be called \"sir\" as a sign that they are now equal to men. I've read this in a couple of different books now and I just have to wonder something. Why is a woman shown to be equal to a man by calling her a term of respect meant for a man? Is it because calling her \"maam\" would denote a lower position? The female equivalent to the same word is somehow less? My Feminist Senses are tingling. Feminist Senses are like Spidey Senses, but they originate in the uterus and make me a bit crankier and wanting chocolate.hum, where exactly do the Spidey Senses originate?So, in this book Eve is trying to solve some murders that seem to have a link in a new drug.

How awesome for them both. I\u2019m glad Robb skipped ahead in time again and took us closer to the big day. I loved watching Eve and Roarke\u2019s nerves. Of course, neither of them was worried for the same reasons. Eve worried about making it work long term and Roarke worried about Eve going through with it. LOL.Eve\u2019s team is expanded beyond the usual people\u2014namely, Feeney. Eve pulls in Peabody, a cop she took a shine to in the last book, and finds herself stuck having to cooperate with a cop from another department. Although Eve has dealt with Roarke being involved in her two previous cases (that we\u2019ve seen, I mean), she suddenly finds herself faced with Mavis\u2019s involvement. We see a very stressed and vulnerable Eve here as she struggles to juggle doing her job with protecting her friend.I loved getting to see more of Mavis here. She\u2019s loud and flamboyant, but she loves Eve to pieces. It may be an unlikely pairing on the surface, but they have a very strong bond. I think Mavis being involved hurt Eve more than Roarke being involved in the past because Mavis is more easily bruised than he is. She thinks of Roarke as stronger and knows he can stand of his own. With Mavis, Eve is furious to find herself forced to hurt her and scare her as she does her job.It was pretty awesome to finally have a clear picture of what led to Eve being found when she was a child. The flashbacks were disturbing and hard to read. Just as with the murders we\u2019ve seen so far, Robb pulls no punches with the truth of Eve\u2019s situation. We are faced with the grim and horrifying truth up close and personal. There is no way I could have remained unaffected. I\u2019m glad she shared with Roarke, but I was ready to strangle her there for a while. I know what led her to say the things she did about their future together, but I felt that she needlessly (and thoughtlessly) wounded Roarke. I\u2019m glad Dr. Mira was able to help them both through that situation.Speaking of that situation, it showed me another side of Summerset. I have disliked him pretty consistently til now, but he finally softened me. How can I not thaw just a little bit after hearing about his past with Roarke and seeing the way he cared for Eve when she had a nightmare? He\u2019s still a jerk, but now that I\u2019ve seen his marshmallow heart I don\u2019t think I can hate him. There were quite a few amusing scenes in this book. Eve is forced out of her comfort zone to help cheer Mavis up and to prep for the big day. She\u2019s stuck getting her hair cut, getting naked in front of multiple people for vanity\u2019s sake, and is forced to endure someone rubbing crap on her boobs too. ;) I\u2019m sure you know how well that went over. Mavis and her crew are hilarious simply by being them\u2014over the top, wonderful them. But the part that I really loved was toward the end when Mira, Peabody, Nadine, and Mavis all got together with Eve and got drunk. Peabody in particular was amusing.I found parts of this slower than the previous two. I loved all the personal stuff, but some of the case work felt a little tedious. That slight slowness is really the only thing that dropped the grade. I just had a hard time getting into parts of it."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "This is my second reading but my first reviewing of this totally enjoyable book!

If I want to be able to review and distinguish all 40+ books in the series, I may as well rate them uniquely.So far, Glory In Death is my favorite book of the series. The reason is simple: Eve's personal life was tightly interwoven with the case.I'm not going to say more lest I spoil something. Only maybe that, even though I'd lightly suspected the person who eventually turned out to be the murderer, it was still a surprise. Conversely to \"Immortal In Death\" (book two) there weren't as many suspects, which heightened the frustration since Eve was hoping for more to turn out, but also made it more interesting, IMO, because I was always shifting between: \"It must be him... no, definitely her... maybe they did it together?\"Her relationship with Roarke keeps on growing and, in this installment, I'd say we see a lighter aspect of it. There isn't major angst concerning their relationship, but some of their scenes were hilarious, swoony and downright romantic. That man is pure gold! First and foremost, he holds dear Eve's well-being, even when she doesn't give a flying crap about it.\n\n\u201cI doubt this will diminish your authority,\u201d he murmured, then pressed his lips softly to hers. \u201cI love you.\u201d\u201cYeah, well.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cPoetry.\u201d\n\nI love their dynamics because even though Eve loves Roarke, she has issues expressing it and coming to terms with the fact that someone like him could love her back. Roarke is the main chaser in the relationship, and, with her doubts and his certainty, they remind me a lot of Cat and Bones from the Night Huntress series. \n\n\u201cSorry I blubbered on you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always available for blubbering.\u201d He came toward her with a steaming omelette and a cup. He sat down, stared into her swollen, exhausted eyes. \u201cI adore you.\u201dShe flushed. It seemed he was the only one who could bring embarrassed color to her cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to distract me.\u201d She took the plate and a fork. \u201cThat kind of stuff always does, and I can never get my tongue around what I should say back.\u201d She sampled the eggs. \u201cMaybe something like you\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\nThere's instead a major turning point in Eve's life, and although I would have expected it to be revealed further in the series, to see how Roarke stood by her side and fought for their happiness made me want to slow clap and to kiss him. Well, everything he does makes me want to smooch him but that scene particularly so.\n\n\"I won\u2019t let you go, Eve. If you didn\u2019t love me or want me or need me, I would have to. But you do love me and want me.

It's the genius of this author and the reason she's one of the most read authors out there. In Immortal in Death, Eve is once again faced with a killer. These murders are somehow related to a new drug that somehow not only makes the user feel really, really good, but also makes them appear younger, more glowing. While it makes them feel immortal, it also is a fast killer. First, a well known fashion model is killed...and the prime suspect is Eve's best friend. So now Eve's job is again personal. I find it a bit hard to believe that any police department would let their primary detective be the best friend of the accused. But they let her 'detect' back when Roarke was a suspect, so why not continue the trend here? I tried to just ignore the logics of the story and instead just settled in to get more sexy Roarke and kick ass Eve, with a dash of funny as hell Mavis, Eve's friend. Eve and Roarke's wedding is right around the corner and it's hilarious watching the fashion forward disaster who is Mavis try to cousel Eve, who has absolutely no sense of style, on her choice of wedding dress and accessories.Of course, the suave and sophisticated Roarke is so laid back and understanding, once again. He's pretty much willing to go with whatever Eve chooses as long as he can get her down the aisle without backing out first. Another great installment to the series. I'm excited to read the next, if only to see if domestic bliss has settled Eve to the fact that Roarke is a permanent fixture in her life. Again, I can't recommend the audio to these enough.

I'm sure I'll say that about another but I did say out of the three. Eve is characterized as a human being. Hey even a bad ass has feeling and care for others but hasn't she always? When her memories starts to come more and more it made me sad for her but it also showed you that because of what happened made her the strong person that she is now and what makes her care so much about getting justice for those who can't get it themselves. Roarke of course is the perfect match for her because not only is he yummy, sweet, and sexy but he also has compassion for what Eve is going through. He knows what Eve is going through but will not let her try to hide from her past and he pushes her to get through them and doesn't let her pull away because he believes that she is strong than that. Like I say \"perfect\" for Eve.Even though the murder involved Mavis, Eve's friend, she knew that she had Eve there to help her prove her innocence. Mavis was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I also enjoyed the \"mini Eve\" Peabody. She is a great character but without Eve's troubling past. I like that even though Eve is her superior she can dish as well and I think that make a get team when there together as one. I hope that in rest of the series we see more of her. There are so many other characters that are in this series that make Eve who she is or are a part of Eve in ways that I also enjoy but you would have to read to book to find out.

But just barely. I enjoyed this one..but found myself still unsure how I feel about Eve. She just seems... don't want to say hypocritical, inconsistent would be a better word. Maybe I wouldn't have noticed this as much if I hadn't read the first three books back to back. But since I did, it was hard not to compare how she treated Commander Whitney's troubled friends in the 2nd book, to how she behaved when it was her own best friend on the line. I also found it odd, that she is breaking rules right and left, but when it came down to her own traumatic revelations...she was going to ruin her career and postone her wedding, to follow procedure.Beyond those few nit picks, I really liked Eve's growth in this one...though she is still hurting Roarke at times, it can be somewhat forgiven considering her past. I liked the expanded roles of Peabody and Mira, with more insight into the butler we all love to hate. I thought the \"whodunit\" was fairly well done...though tedious at points of the investigation. And how many lives is Eve going to be responsible for ruining?? I hope this plot device isn't the norm for the rest of the series.All in all, an enjoyable read."}], "description": "She was one of the most sought after women in the world.
