The problem that I am having is that I want to continue reading about this drow elf but the author is ever increasingly making him a weak character. Drizzt has never really defeated any large bosses, it always comes at the hands of his companions. Drizzt never finds real love... I suppose because he is always conflicted. Drizzt is never the real hero in any of the stories, it always turns out to be a side kick.Another thing about Salvatore's writings that is starting to wear on me is that none of the main characters ever die, when you think that they do he finds a way to bring them back. Wulfgar should have remained dead, Catti-Brie and Bruenor should both died somewhere along the way as well. It appears to me that this book was comprised of 380 pages of fluff and no real substance and that is unfortunate. Yes, I will buy the Orc King and continue reading, however, I'm going in assuming to be disappointed once again since this has been the pattern since the Dark Legacy Trilogy. Come on Mr. Salvatore don't write a book just for a buck put a little passion into it. Kill off a main character once in a while or at the very least but some mystery and unsuspecting turns in the plot for once. Stop writing as if you are trying to create a play guide for a dungeon master somewhere. I see the potential of your characters and the brilliance of your writing style but what I am not finding is a quality story. This one has left me the most disappointed so far. Here's hoping the Orc King breaks this pattern."}, {"userName": "Lauren ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7141908-lauren", "userReview": "Much has been said of R.A. Salvatore's Forgotten Realms novels in the last few years, and most of it is negative. are Drizzt and his friends seemingly invulnerable? Yes. Has Salvatore failed to introduce much in the way of interesting new characters? Yes. Are his books generally getting repetitive? Yes. Are they boring?...well, no.Most of the fantasy I read is in the Forgotten Realms world. Take that as you will, but Salvatore still wipes the floor with the majority as the Realms writers. Usually Salvatore, Elaine Cummingham, Troy Denning, and Douglas Niles are reliable writers of fun fantasy novels (for those angry readers who want to see a bloodbath in which scores of good-guy characters die, look no further than the Moonshae Trilogy by Douglas \"Grim Reaper\" Niles). The others range from passable to excruciating. But I know what to expect from Salvatore. I don't read his books to be enlightened- I read them to be entertained, and Salvatore does it again in The Two Swords.The story finds Drizzt Do'Urden spending most of his time trying to free a captured Pegasus from the bad guys- orcs, trolls, frost giants, but especially King Obould Many-Arrows, a clever orc who appears to have become the avatar of the orc god Gruumsh, and is pretty much invincible. If this stuff sounds like boring stuff for Drizzt, it is- but remember Drizzt is wallowing in self-loathing because he believes all of his friends are dead, so he's trying to find something to do besides return to Mithral Hall and face the music (or so he thinks). Plus, he's trying to think to impress Innovindil, his moon-elf sorta-girlfriend (who has lost her horse! Sounds sort of like the plot of a Barbie comic!). In spite of this, Drizzt finds plenty of time to puree orcs, not to mention (and I don't think I'm spoiling a thing here) fight King Obould.As for Drizzt's friends, they're imprisoned inside Mithral Hall by about a billion orcs (give or take a few zeros). Bruenor, recently returned from the dead (yeah, I know, keep reading), leads his dwarves in devising all kinds of A-Team like devices to turn orcs into chunky orc salsa. Wulfgar is having serious marital issues with his jealous wife Delly, and Catti-brie is torn between wondering what become of Drizzt and flirting with Wulfgar. All fairly typical of Salvatore's subplots in his last few novels.The story, however, moves along at a fast pace despite all these apparent obstacles- it is really only dragged down by the pathetic Galen Firth and his inability to kill the trolls that want to slaughter his kinsmen from Nesme. Salvatore spends a decent amount of time bringing secondary characters to an unpleasant demise, but he neglects to introduce Galen's face to 20 or so orcish arrows. Too bad the interesting mage Shoudra had to be turned into cat food by Obould in The Lone Drow, she would have been a much better character in this book, though led by the supposedly brilliant chieftain Gerti, serve little purpose besides chucking boulders into unfortunate places.Honestly, I think most of this book's enjoyability comes from the dwarves. Drizzt put Salvatore on the map, but I think he writes dwarves better than just about anyone. let me add a caveat by saying the \"names\" he gives those dwarves are often horrifying (quick! spot the REAL Salvatore dwarf name! \"Cordio Muffinhead\" \"Kragg Weaselface\" \"Alebrain Forgefarter\"), but the dwarves are easily the most likable characters in the book, mostly for their selfishness, love of life, and the fact that they don't give a...Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder, formerly of Salvatore's Cleric Quintet, are probably the best of the dwarves because their personalities aren't quite so cookie-cutter as those of the others.Finally, Regis the halfling finds ways to be useful as always, although his role is a bit diminished here and he is more or less an injured reserve for most of the book. I still think Regis, who usually wins with brains vs. brawn, is one of Salvatore's best characters. He appears useless, but often displays unmatched courage and innovation.Perhaps the most significant thing about this book among Salvatore's novels is that there isn't a happy ending of any sort. Drizzt slugs it out with Obould, and dwarves turn lots of orcs into hash, but Salvatore does a good job impressing upon the reader that BAD THINGS are happening to the North of Faerun, things that will outlast a novel trilogy or two. Obould, for his part, is a calculating and formidable opponent. Although very evil, his blood thirst is limited by his tact, and exactly what the limits of his power are, are not explored in this book. Among Drizzt's enemies, Obould is not as interesting as Artemis, but he is more dangerous. Expect Obould to be around for awhile.Unsurprisingly, the book sets up for a sequel or new trilogy, but the good news for weary Salvatore fans is that it looks like he's going to venture into some interesting territory with Bruenor and Drizzt. I never thought Drizzt was done with Ellifain, the elf girl whose life Drizzt once saved only to have her attempt to murder him decades later, and it looks like he's going to try to put those demons to rest. Bruenor seems to be heading off to find some ancient dwarven Moradin-given wisodm that might destroy Obould. I think that road will end with Bruenor's death, so those of you who wish to see one or more of Salvatore's main characters but the farm ought to stay tuned.Should you read this book if you have enjoyed Salvatore's past novels in the series? Sure! Don't expect, well...ANY loose ends to be tied up, but this is a typical fast-paced, enjoyable book from Mr. Salvatore. If you absolutely hated every Salvatore novel since Streams of Silver, you can skip this one because you'll probably just have an aneurysm. You could instead go read 1500 pages to see if Robert Jordan writes about anything but women's clothing this time, or maybe even go read some Ed Greenwood if you really want to get mad while reading a Realms novel.Otherwise, enjoy Drizzt's exploits- and don't feel guilty about it."}, {"userName": "Greg Strandberg", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19382532-greg-strandberg", "userReview": "This review will have some spoilers.This is the second time I read this book. The whole trilogy is good, and I like it a lot more than the Sellswords Series that came before. Salvatore is trying to do some transitioning here and tying up some loose ends. I was not a big fan of the Delly/Colson storyline, and that came to an end here pretty much. I really liked how the sword Khazid\u2019hea was used in this book.There was some good troll battling early on in this book, and then just general fighting. There\u2019s some intrigue with the Pegasus, and that\u2019s kind of fun, suspense-building too. The battle with the Riders of Nesme in the Trollmoors was also interesting.The story really builds in suspense as Drizzt goes after the Pegasus and then decided to go after Obould. There\u2019s a lot of inner-turmoil as he finally figures out he loves Cattie-Brie. There were some great chariot scenes with Alustriel coming in and laying fiery waste to some stuff. Good fight scenes in Gerti\u2019s frost giant ice fortress as well. She\u2019s a fun character, and I suggest you search out an image of her on Google. The river scenes with Drizzt were also cool.All in all, this is a good book. I\u2019ve never read farther in the series than this, and look forward to. I like that the Wulfgar love angle has been tied up, at least the last 5 to 6 books\u2019 worth."}, {"userName": "Kati", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/198122-kati", "userReview": "Would you believe that I actually rooted for the orcs? I would've liked the book so much more if it had been just about the dwarves against the orcs. I loved Obould's rise to power, his vision. And I loved reading about the dwarves, how they all united against the enemy and how they kicked major butt with the help of Nanfoodle the gnome and Pikel the \"doo-da\". Those parts were awesome, the back and forth between the two armies. The rest though...The only characters who actually went forward and made real progress were Nanfoodle the gnome and Regis the halfling - who were, together with Pikel Bouldershoulder, my favorite characters. Catti-brie? I don't want Drizzt, I do want Drizzt, I don't, I do... Wulfgar? Still having feelings for Catti-brie. Delly Curtie? From a strong woman back to a jealous, stupid harpy. Drizzt? First price for incessant whining. Innovindil? Trying to be the wise teacher but mostly totally confusing Drizzt. And let's not even talk about the self-centered Galen Firth!You know, this was the first book that made me actually dislike Drizzt. Not only his cowardice that stopped him from going back to Mithral Hall but also his endless ruminating and his, dare I say, arrogance and hypocrisy. Pshaw, he can take care of Obould, no problem! How dare Obould talk about fairness when he's wearing an impenetrable armor - says the guy with the magic swords and anklets! There's no room for orcs among good people - says the frickin' dark elf living among them!To sum it up: How can I give a book more than 2 stars when I intensely disliked the main hero?"}, {"userName": "Terry Costantini", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6523153-terry-costantini", "userReview": "I have to admit I am annoyed. It is one thing to be constantly bombarded with trilogies in this series, but at least they would end in a somewhat satisfying way. My guilty pleasure I would often remark. This one built and built, and was building to something great - then fizzled into ... nothing. The end of this book did more to set up the next books than to end this one! I simply hate when characters make obviously stupid choices, and this ending doesn't even make sense! **SPOILERS** Why would the drow elves turn on Obould at his point of supposed victory? Why in such a lame fashion? Delly leaves and attacks orcs? For what other than to move the stupid sword and make Wulfgar even more stoic? Nothing is even close to resolved at the end, and now the \"gang\" is going off in different directions to deal with useless, and boring-sounding quests, even though thousands and thousands of orcs are surrounding the Hall! This is silly. I almost gave up on Drizzt after the last trilogy, but this one reengaged me, especially after the second book, but now I am so upset that I may not continue with my guilty pleasure, as I now I feel somewhat ashamed."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10152557-scott", "userReview": "For the longest time I thought this would be the first R.A.

That is what this entire trilogy turned out to be and the last book in the series (The Two Swords) was the worst offender. 376 pages of action and battles and nothing else.

This question is repeatedly asked and slowly answered by Drizzt Do'urden as he continues his journey in the final book of of the Hunter's Blades Trilogy, The Two Swords, by R.A. Salvatore. It continues on with Drizzt and the elf Innovindil tracking down Gerti and her frost giants to their home in Shining White. Obould, the orc king and supposed god of the orcs, has given Sunrise, one of the pegasi that is highly important to Innovindil, to Gerti as a gift for her assistance. Meanwhile, the orcs begin to break into Mithril Hall only to be cut down by several of Clan Battlehammer's war machines and traps. Friends will be united. Allies will appear. Armies will clash. What will happen in the end? Find out by reading the book. I believe this book didn't quite deliver on its promise of being the final one in the trilogy. It had a great build up that kept me glued to the pages, but it all ended up being nothing but a let down, and a possible set up for another series of books in the saga. But overall, the action was superb and the adventure was wonderful, and the book was a great read. This book shows that sometimes, even in the midst of a terrible event, good things can happen. A good lesson for everyone to learn. I suggest this book to those who like fantasy, action, and a good adventure. I don't suggest this to those who don't like fantasy, action, and adventure.

It took me about 2 years to read the trilogy, for a variety of reasons. In truth, I spread it out for enjoyment, reading seasons, vacation time, and to keep on pace with my own novel writing. One of the primary I began reading Salvatore was because of the similarities between his writing style and mine\u2014and then I received some of his D&D books as gifts and so I just kept reading.The Hunter\u2019s Blades trilogy gave me mixed feelings. The Two Swords (book 3) is assuredly my favorite and the one I am reviewing. I especially enjoyed the final pages, and really the last half of the book feels like the denouement of one larger story\u2014as if it the trilogy were just one big book. That could be great, except it made the pacing difficult for me. The Two Swords finally winds down and begins to give us some closure (and the relationships are finally in focus, whereas everything felt clouded in a haze of war, previously to it.) in contrast, The Lone Drow\u2014despite giving us Innovindil, who I really liked\u2014felt like one really long dark moment. It was lonely. Everything circled around itself and kept the geography limited. Nothing about it made me like the characters any more\u2014maybe the opposite, in fact. It was, however, necessary\u2014but that\u2019s what it made all seem like one larger book. The Thousand Orcs had a great setup, making the first book-end on the trilogy.In the final twenty pages or so Salvatore does a phenomenal job of seamlessly setting the hook for the expansive world at large, obviously setting up any number of directions the reader (and author(s)) might go with Forgotten Realms stories. And that\u2019s part of the whole appeal of D&D and the fantasy genre as a whole. Masterful writing, perhaps a little long winded at times, but great story that blows open new avenues and interest in the D&D landscape.D&D is a dangerous world and this trilogy proves deadly for many characters\u2014even some you might initially think have character shields.

I honestly can't tell what the intent was of Salvatore; did he meant for king Obould to become the real hero of this story? I can't imagine why but that is what happened. None of the so called \"good\" characters and their petty concerns even came close to the ankles of King Obould, who is Gruumsh, his vision and personality are far more interesting then the emotional difficulties the main character and his friends have perhaps Gertri the leader of the frost giants came close but still.... But what really turned me around, was the insistent arrogance towards the orcs and the complete denial of their worth as living beings. The very idea that orcs should have rights to sun and air is beyond comprehension for every character here and I guess that is supposed to show how unusual and formidable or dangerous Obould really is, but it only made me want him to smite these arrogant pricks even harder. Nah I am firmly on the orc's side and I wish this series of books had been about Obould and his quest for an orc homeland not about Drizzt and his friends being moody and sullen nags three books long or bragging how many orcs they have killed or going to kill. In addition, a little extract from the gods pages in forgotten realms, that only proves the orcs had every right for what they did. Gruumsh's enmity with the other gods started with a lottery. The gods of the dwarves, elves, gnomes, halflings, humans and orcs met to draw lots to determine which parts of the world was to be inhabitated by their respective worshippers. The non-orcish gods rigged the lot. Elves got the forests, dwarves the mountains, humans the right to live wherever they wanted, and so on, but there was no lot prepared for the orcs. Gruumsh was mocked and insulted by the others for this and was enraged over the others cheating the orcs into destitution as part of a joke. He lifted his spear to strike caves and holes into world and claimed these for his worshippers and vowed that they will grow stronger there to ultimately kill everyone of the cheaters and take everything from them."}, {"userName": "Jake", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51492556-jake", "userReview": "The action and battles in this book were great. There were several amazing moments between the dwarves and the orcs. If you are reading this for the action this made it worth it. However; this was definitely the weakest book of this trilogy. It struggled on several fronts.Firstly, it harped even more on the forced romance angle with Cattle-brie and Drittz... bleh. Compounding on this, Salvatore introduces this ridiculous and out of place arc with Delly, where she is unhappy with being stuck in the dwarven caves. With literally thousands of orcs swarming around Mithral Hall, Wulfgar nearly dying several times, and hundreds of refugees without a home, this is the story salvatore decides to tell with this character. It comes out of no where, and contradicts the supportive and strong female he built up in the first two books. It's almost as if he realized he had created a more natural romance and so needed to destroy it with forced drama!Besides these failings, which have continued throughout most of salvatore's work I have read, \"the Two Swords\" doesn't actually give any conclusion to the story it builds up. Without giving spoilers you could have stopped with book two and largely the characters and the realm is in the same place. The only major difference is some forced and awkard emotional growth on the part of a few characters...Overall a big disappointment.

The Dwarves prepare an elaborate defense to stave off the orc horde, and as creative as the dwarven engineers are, the descriptions of their mighty contraptions sometimes require a second read-through to fully grasp. The dwarven defense is only one of the many plot lines that coalesce to a resolution. To the south, the whiny and annoying human leader Galen Firth, is just begging to have his head chopped off by the axe of a dwarf or lobbed off by a troll's swiping claw. To the north, the dark elven hero, Drizzt, and his moon elf companion, Innovindil, attempt a daring rescue of the pegasus, Sunrise. And within the residencies of Mithral Hall itself, the human refugees struggle to find their place. The overarching theme is shown through Innovindil's mentor-like role to Drizzt, as she helps him understand life through the century-spanning eyes of an elf; which is a much more refreshing perspective for Drizzt after witnessing him go through 600+ pages of depression. The power struggle among the villains, and the journey of Khazid'hea, the sentient sword, lead up to an epic showdown that almost makes up for the lackluster trilogy. As always, Salvatore ends the tale with the promise of more adventure, albeit another of the usual fantasy tropes, he does leave a couple threads hanging to keep the readers interested."}, {"userName": "Dani (The Pluviophile Writer)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4012281-dani-the-pluviophile-writer", "userReview": "Review at The Pluviophile Reader: http://bit.ly/1N91zR73/5 stars.Paperback, 376 pages.Read from September 02 to 16, 2015.If someone had told me 10 years ago when I first picked up this series that I'd still be reading it, I would have called them liars. This is the 16th book in the Legend of Drizzt series , and the third and final book in the Hunter's Blade Trilogy by R.A. Salvatore. What's mad, is that I'm only part way through this series! Not sure if this is true, but I was told that Salvatore would have ended the series ages ago but because all the rights are owned by Forgotten Realms so if he stopped writing it, then they would have just had someone else to write it for him. Needless to say, even without that knowledge, you have to give it to Salvatore for keeping the quality of this series consistent and enjoyable.Drizzt, a righteous and kind dark-elf, is alone and in mourning as he believe that all of his friends, Bruenor the dwarf and King of Mithral Hall, and his two adopted step-children: Catti-brie, a feisty human warrior, Wulfgar the Giant, and Regis, aka Rumblebelly the halfling, are dead from the battle in previous book. Innovindil, a moon elf, has been helping Drizzt learn what it means to be an elf and to help him deal with his grief and his remaining feelings for Catti-brie. With the fight going on against the orcs, Innovindil's dead lover's pegasus' was captured so the two of them are out to reclaim it. Meanwhile, a massive war wages at Mithral Hall where Bruenor is on death's doorstep and his two step-children are alive and waging, what appears to be a losing battle, against Obould and his orc army. Drizzt's quest with the pegasus will eventually lead him back to Mithral Hall and the staggering odds against the orcs.I found myself trying to race through the chapters in hopes that Drizzt would soon be reunited with his friends and that he would finally get a chance to express his feelings to Catti-brie, which is something reader's have been anticipating since the beginning of the series.As with many of Salvatore's books, this book is pretty predictable, but that's not really why I read them. Out of all the books that I read, I have to admit that this series is my guilty pleasure. They are always an easy read with wonderful characters that you look forward to following on whatever adventure they partake in. I believe that you don't even need to enjoy fantasy novels to find pleasure in this series as Salvatore does such a great job with his character work. Another solid story by Salvatore!"}, {"userName": "Clarkhou", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12561517-clarkhou", "userReview": "This book is about an orc king named Obould and his kinsmen sending waves of assaults against Bruenor king of Mithral Hall and leader of the Battle hammer clan in an attempt to capture it and kill king bruenor and his folks, and just after Obould lost to Bruenor so he began to reassemble his for another assault but returns defeated after the swarming of dwarfs attacking his forces and the latter's allies from all directions. Aside from the conflict between the orcs and the dwarfs attention was focused mostly on Drizzt whom on a mission is helping his companion Innovindil to find her Pegasus and which Drizzt battles Obould for a final confrontation...I began reading this book because it has a lot of detailed writing and clearly illustrates what the writer is trying to describe in a bold way and it's very clear to understand but only if you have read the books before this one in the series and it has a lot of twists and suspense(which I like) in other books the same author wrote. I also picked up this book because I read the other books before this one so I'd like to finish the series and know what happens next.I finished the book because I wanted to know which side won? Dwarfs vs orcs and I want to know what will happen next in the series like will it be finished? Or to be continued?I would recommend this book to a lot of the fantasy readers out there, since it is a very detailed book and it has a lot of words that mostly readers that reads fantasy might understand and it also fits into adventure, which most students from secondary school to high school would enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Shawn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10601562-shawn", "userReview": "There are a lot of fantasy writers out there... What makes RA Salvatore different? To start, it is the character building. Most of his characters, even if they aren't the main ones, are not cardboard cutouts. They have conflicting emptions, desires, and often disagree about what the heroes of the novels want to do (sometimes vociferously). This was very evident in this story as the invading orcs consolidate their holdings and plot their next move. The dwarfs and the humans who fight side-by-side exemplify this as they do so with different goals that sometimes lead to trouble. Often the staid, one dimensional characters see added merely as a contrast to the more defined personae. One lack in this tale was the companions themselves.... They have some important adventures and play some key roles, but increasingly Salvatore seems to be leaving the impetus and ideas to the more ancillary characters, for the better I think.That being said, I had a couple of problems with this book. Drizzt's companion, fresh off her revenge killing of the orc who killed her lover continues her amorous advances... seemingly little bothered by any residual feelings. There are other characters that seem to undergo random personality shifts as well (Delly Curtie for example).My other problem with this book is that, though it is the end of a trilogy, little is wrapped up, making this a lead in to the next series.All in all, definitely worth the read if you have come this far in the series and with some promising developments on the horizon."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26868907-richard", "userReview": "*****WARNING-Minor Spoilers*****The Two Swords ends RA Salvador's The Hunter's Blades trilogy. The book picks up where the previous one left off and continues the saga of Drizzt Do'urdon and friends. Sadly I found this book the weakest of the trilogy. Salvador usually does a good job of keeping his writing within the realms of possibility of the actual Dungeons and Dragons game. This book (and really the trilogy in general) strain that to the breaking point. While the Orc King is certainly a worthy foe for Drizzt, the introduction of Lady Alustriel raises the bar considerably. In my opinion, when a writer brings in one of the heavy hitters of the Forgotten Realms there has to be stakes in play to match. The orc horde, and King Obould specifically, are never described with adequate weight and thus the inaction of one of the Seven Sisters is hard to understand. Beyond the problems with Lady Alustriel there are also several other issues. The motivations of several characters are hard to understand. Drizzt repeatedly refrains from learning the fate of this friends even once he gains access to a flying mount and could easily do so. The encounter between Gurti and Drizzt felt forced. The human leader of Nesme was so consistently dislike-able it was hard to imagine anyone following him anywhere. Several of the fight scenes felt repetitive. While I recommend those who enjoy the tales of Drizzt to read this book I cannot say I was not disappointed. Hopefully this is a one of and RA Salvador returns to form in the next book."}, {"userName": "David Williams", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5133900-david-williams", "userReview": "The dwarves of Mithril Hall are still besieged. Somehow their king Bruenor Battlehammer has returned from them. All thought that he had gone to the halls of his fathers even though the clerics had kept his body going. Somehow Regis had been able to reach inside and pull him out again. Now Bruenor is leading the dwarves once again. Reinforcements are on their way. The orc horde of Obould still holds strong. Obould is now believed to be possessed with the powers of the orcish god. Meanwhile outside of Mithril Hall Drizzt continues his personal war against the orcs. Still believing his friends slain he fights with no other purpose than revenge. He has joined with the Moonwood elf Innovindil as they seek to avenge the death of her lover. In addition to helping Drizzt fight the orcs she also teaches him that he must learn to live his life in short spans when dealing with friends of the lesser races. If he refuses to live and love then he will always be alone. The pain of loss will come, but that is offset by the joy of living.This novel has some great parts. The ending really isn\u2019t an ending, it\u2019s more of a setup for the next trilogy. The important part of this book is Drizzt finally learning to come to grips with his own emotions. There is love, loss, heroism and heartbreak in this volume of the Legacy of Drizzt. It is more high action from the king of Sword and Sorcery fantasy."}, {"userName": "Branwen Sedai *of the White Ajah*", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5701086-branwen-sedai-of-the-white-ajah", "userReview": "\"To be an elf is to celebrate life.
