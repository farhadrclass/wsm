In 2015 into 2016, standing on the smoldering ruins of my 23-year marriage, I took a hard look at my life and found some things that I needed to change. I was depressed, overweight, and in general not a happy camper. When my General Practitioner gave me a stern talking to and wanted to put me on a bunch of meds, I knew it was time to make a change.I was working out and doing what the \"experts\" said you should do, but nothing was working on the weight. So, I started doing my own research. That led me to Jason Fung. His first book, The Obesity Code, led me to Robert Lustig's Fat Chance, and Gary Taubes' excellent book, The Case Against Sugar. (Lustig is a pediatric endocrinologist who treats morbidly obese children, and Taubes is a science journalist).Long story short, these authors laid out the true drivers of obesity and weight gain - sugar and simple (refined) carbohydrates. It's a hormonal problem rather than a calorie problem. Our bodies handle a 100 calories of Broccoli far differently than a 100 calories of sugar or pasta. (Don't believe the lie that a \"calorie is a calorie.\")Sugars and things converted quickly to sugar, spike the hormone insulin and insulin's job is to store energy. Once the liver and muscles are full that means more fat. So long as we have circulating insulin, we cannot burn fat. And by constantly eating carbs and sugar (bagel for breakfast, sandwich for lunch, chips as a snack, pasta at dinner, beer after dinner) we always have insulin in our system.By dramatically reducing sugar and refined carbohydrates from my life, I lost about 65 lbs in 2016. My blood pressure, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and fasting blood sugar have all gone to healthy levels. And the weight has remained off. At my last check up my doctor said that I was \"his healthiest patient.\" He also wanted to know what I had done!The Diabetes Code doesn't really add anything to my knowledge base in terms of health and nutrition, but I read it because I respect the author and it's nice to get a reinforcing message periodically. (It did dwell a bit more on Type 2 Diabetes). If you are really interested in learning more, go out and read Gary Taubes' excellent book The Case Against Sugar. He does a fantastic job of laying out the mess that the Standard American Diet is and how we got to where we are.Four stars out of five."}, {"userName": "John Madany", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42142931-john-madany", "userReview": "Extremely encouragingAs a family practice physician this book is just what I needed to keep me focused on the identification and treatment of metabolic syndrome. Jason Fung put it all together in a very readable format. He helped me understand some things that I have already observed in my patients. My experience is confirmed by this book. I am very familiar with his sources and they have inspired me. Now this book becomes a state-of-the-art reference."}, {"userName": "Laurie Rockenbeck", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1113672-laurie-rockenbeck", "userReview": "This book is excellent for those beginning their T2 journey. As someone who has been on the road for a while, a lot of the information was redundant. Dr. Fung makes up for that with a clear description of why traditional medicine only sees one path for diabetics. Fortunately for people reading this book, we get a completely new set of guidelines to help set us free from the traditional theory that diabetes is a 'progressive' disease that has only one bad ending. The book gives a clear description of how insulin and glucose work in the body and all that good stuff. The big difference is you learn that fasting and diet changes CAN make all the symptoms go away. Once diabetic, you are forever diabetic, BUT you don't have to live forever with high blood sugars or all the devastating complications of diabetes."}, {"userName": "Susan Jessup", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9580144-susan-jessup", "userReview": "I purchased this book to assist me with ideas for a few of my family members that are suffering with diabetes after reading the obesity code. I enjoyed that their was a lot of scientific data to support Fung's findings. The only part I wasn't thrilled about was that an entire section of this book repeated what was stated in the Obesity Code book and since I read that book right before I read this one it was unnecessary. The conclusions found in the Obesity Code were similar to this book. Basically I felt if I read one of these books I could have gained similar amounts of knowledge. I was hoping for a little more."}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63285101-kris", "userReview": "I am intrigued with Dr Fung's ideas about intermittent fasting for good health especially concerning weight and insulin control.

Thank God my body rejected the thing that was causing me harm. It caused me to look deeper into alternate solutions -- and then this book crossed my path. It may very well save my life. Today, I take my power back and am no longer a victim of my disease. Today, I fasted and exercised with the full understanding of how I was helping my body heal.

It also recommends fasting. These two combined help to prevent and reverse Type 2 diabetes. All medical doctors should read this book. They should give these books to insurance companies who would save millions of dollars by implementing diet and fasting to treat type 2 diabetes. Thank you Jason Fung for writing this book"}, {"userName": "K", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15542383-k", "userReview": "I was already well read on Dr Fung's work between The Obesity Code and devouring everything on his blog (I mean everything). Still, I want every nugget of wisdom he has to offer. I liked that this book focused on diabetes, primarily T2, and I appreciated his thoughts on cutting the processed foods. He also gives you information on fasting with two sample fasting schedules at the end. This book is well worth owning. If you have diabetes or are prediabetic this is the info you want. I'm sure others will write more thorough reviews (thanks in advance to those people), but as a person who has completely reversed metabolic disorder all I can say is Dr Fung is the man. (I personally follow a low carb healthy fat diet with an emphasis on whole, plant-based foods, avoiding sugar and processed foods like the plague). Dr Fung includes charts and easy to read explanations about what is going on and this helps the reader get an idea about what to do and not do. In fact, there are specific chapters titled here's what not to do and here are the things you should do. Highly recommend!"}, {"userName": "Marcos Malumbres", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67319870-marcos-malumbres", "userReview": "An essential book. Relatively short and to the point.Reading it I thought that the basis of nutrition should be part of the elementary education at school. The story about the 1977 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (recommendation of high carbohydrate diet) is really scary and the comparison of the metabolic syndrome as the most important current plague is actually very well taken. It will take several years (perhaps a few generations) to distribute this message. In the meantime, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems and Alzheimer's will continue increasing simply due to the good, cheap, tasting of simple carbohydrates, and the technical advances in the last years that make so simple and cheap to add sugar to almost every food."}, {"userName": "Ankit Desai", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4089693-ankit-desai", "userReview": "Fantastic, insightful and detailed!As a Type 2 diabetic, this was an eye opener in terms of the reasons why current treatments by doctors don't work, why one gets this disease and how it can be reversed.
