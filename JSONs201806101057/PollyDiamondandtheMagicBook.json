It was a Friday in November and we were home from school for a PD Day. Mom read us chapter after chapter. We all agreed that it was a cool book and we would like to read it again soon. At first, the book sounded very familiar \u2013 like Owl Diaries or Ivy and Bean, but once the magic book arrived, the story went in an amazing direction of its own \u2013 a fun-filled, dancing armadillo, sibling-rivalry, boring babysitter, club sandwich, chess-board floor and perfect house direction that kept us asking mom to read another chapter. We really liked Polly herself. We liked \u2018hearing\u2019 her thoughts. We liked how she described her teacher, Ms. Hairball. We also liked how she didn\u2019t panic went things went wrong. She was devious, intelligent, creative and more, but she also realized the importance of fixing her mistakes. Our mom is forever making us put things right and now we know why. We laughed out loud at the list of \u201cNames NOT to Call Your New Baby Brother\u201d and at \u201cAnna is a banana.\u201d We groaned at everything about Shaylene, and we secretly wanted the magic book to come and help us with some renovations at our house. We learned that writing can be fun and infuriating. We learned about how to choose our words carefully. And now we are attacking our mom\u2019s occasional word salad with a vengeance. We can\u2019t wait to read about more adventures of Polly and the magic book. Thank you for this wonderful story."}, {"userName": "Aubrey Marie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52824695-aubrey-marie", "userReview": "This ARC was given to me by Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

But the book takes everything she says and then writes literally, which causes some problems, including her sister becoming a banana. The book misunderstands her use of certain words too, which causes frustration but also amusement; for instance, when she is hungry and wants a club sandwich, the book delivers two pieces of bread wrapped around a club, and then a card with clubs on it for its next attempt. The word play and confusion make the book funny and a good title to use to demonstrate to budding writers about the precision of words and what writers write. Of course, this is all over the top as things get increasingly crazy until Polly's teacher, Ms. Hairball (!) arrives with the news that the sisters have a new baby brother. There are plenty of illustrations to add to the fun. I would share this with second or third graders since it offers some reading challenges but isn't so hard to read that they'd become frustrated. They'll like the glitter on the cover that seems to indicate there's something special inside too."}, {"userName": "Kadie Hayward Mullins", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76010861-kadie-hayward-mullins", "userReview": "@kidlitexchange #partner This charming story is perfect to read aloud or starter chapter book.

Dealing with the arrival of a new sibling and the energy of little sister, Anna, Polly is enamored with her new book that can take her ideas and turn them into reality \u2013 from turning Anna into a literal banana and her \u2018aquarium blue\u2019 paint into an actual aquarium.

She. Loves. Words. When she discovers a book that can not only write back to her but alter reality, she begins to change her room, her house, even her little sister! Only some very clever writing can return her life to \"normal\" again. Polly Diamond and the Magic Book is the first in a planned series of transitional chapter books. Polly is biracial, though her ethnicity is never discussed in the text. As Polly is particularly fond of words, she discusses similes, prefixes, and many other parts of speech. While it is clear that Polly is meant to teach about language in general, the book is still funny and engaging enough to be read without the grammar agenda. Sweet illustrations on every page in combination with the writing will remind readers of Ivy + Bean. Educators should note that a Common-Core Aligned Teacher Guide is available from the publisher.

I can't wait to read this one with my granddaughter. When Polly writes in her magic book, whatever she writes comes true. It's so much fun because like the Amelia Bedelia books, her magic book takes her ideas dictionary definition literally. I love the part where she writes that her walls are aquarium blue and then her sister can pull a fish right out of the wall when she comes in.The illustrations really warm the pages and make a great story even greater as it comes to life even better than a graphic novel filling the pages as they flow through the words. You nailed it, ladies, it's perfect.The book is didactic in parts, explaining alliteration, for example, but in a chatty, playful way.I highly recommend this one.

My 7 year old read it and absolutely adored it. Kids will really enjoy the way words really have a variety of meanings and realize how important it is to say what you actually mean.
