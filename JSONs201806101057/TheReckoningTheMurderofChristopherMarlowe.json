Rumor later augmented this story, making Marlowe's killer a romantic rival and the location of their fracas a bawdy house. In fact, it wasn't a bawdy house but a respectable inn run by a widow of means, and Marlowe's killer was a con man, as proved by surviving legal documents, just as documents of a more clandestine nature prove that one of the witnesses to Marlowe's murder was employed as a spy in the service of Elizabeth I. So too, evidence strongly indicates, was a second witness, and Marlowe himself appears to have been a spy, beginning with his student days at Cambridge. Though only twenty-nine at the time of his death, he was already well established as a dramatist and poet, but espionage paid the bills as literature could not. Ah, the writing life. Le plus le change, le plus le meme chose. In trying to ferret out the reason for Marlowe's murder, The Reckoning finally and convincingly points to the power struggle between Marlowe's patron, Sir Walter Ralegh, and Ralegh's nemesis, the Earl of Essex, with Marlowe unwittingly caught in the middle, and more than a few strings pulled by Robert Cecil, who succeeded Sir Francis Walsingham as Elizabeth's spymaster. And then there are the various minions, renegades, double agents, provocateurs, counterfeiters, and occasionally reluctant claimants to the English throne. Convoluted? Yes, it is -- at times dizzily so -- and that's my only lament about an otherwise brilliant book that here and there brings the Elizabethans refreshingly to life."}, {"userName": "Lisasue", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6008919-lisasue", "userReview": "Here is a totally misleading phrase:\"Provides the sheer enjoyment of fiction, and might just be true.\"I was totally mislead by this critic's statement, and duped into reading this scholarly tome. No, I am not using the word, \"tome\" to show off. It's the best word choice, because it describes exactly what this book is: \"a book, especially a large, heavy, scholarly one.\"Other reviewers have said that this book reads like a John le Carre novel. It doesn't. It reads like a scholarly exploration of a viable theory about a somewhat obscure writer, and his even more obscure acquaintances. That's not a bad thing if that's what you expect. From that perspective, this is a definite four star book, maybe even a five star one. However, if you're Jo Average (like I am), and you're expecting something similar to Junius and Albert's Adventures in the Confederacy: A Civil War Odyssey, this is not it. In this case, it's a two star book. Sure, the section on the Babington Plot (Mary Queen of Scots) is pretty fascinating, but the rest is just a slog.

This is a book I've known about for ages. I remember in my first English class at university the professor spoke about this book when filling us in on Marlowe's biography, and I meant to read it then. I meant to read it at so many different times in the intervening years, and this very website repeatedly recommended it as a book aligned with my interests.Given my interest in Marlowe and my tendency to engage with any piece of information about him that comes my way, very little in the first part of this book was new to me. Yet I liked that. It was like going back to a comforting re-read, except with the novelty of reading something for the first time. I knew all the players, I knew the scene, I knew the long day at Eleanor Bull's and the suspicious connections of all those involved. I still thrilled at every revelation that I knew was coming, and, by god, I could not stop talking about it to anyone too polite to ask me to shut it. As I progressed through the book it drew out more about the 'secret theatre' of Elizabethan intelligence work, with all its peculiar double-dealing characters. Nicholl makes quite liberal connections and suppositions at times, but also acknowledges this and notes that we only have documents to work with, and can seldom know the motives or reception of those documents.Part of what made this book familiar is the love I bore for Anthony Burgess' A Dead Man in Deptford, which I found in a used bookstore when I was sixteen on a trip to The City and which was one of my favourites for quite some time. It's probably been ten years since I last read it, but now I'm deeply inclined to revisit it and determine what debt it owes to this work of Nicholl's."}, {"userName": "Roman Clodia", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia", "userReview": "The death of Marlowe in 1593 is the start and end point of this dense and detailed investigation as Nicholl attempts to uncover what really happened on that day in Deptford. His archival research is exemplary but I found myself less and less convinced by his theory as the book went on. The 'evidence' is so fragmentary, fraught and fluid that it could be made to tell other stories than the one that Nicholl tells here, and there is nothing that privileges the one he chooses, other than his own conviction.There are various points at which Nicholl's understanding of Elizabethan concepts is less than exact and he tends to assume that words had the same meanings in the 1590s that they have today: 'gay', for example, or 'atheism' which tended to be used for any kind of religious (and social) unorthodoxy e.g. Catholicism, rather than the modern meaning; 'magic', too, could be used for what we now recognise as science rather than the esoteric and occult practises that Nicholl assumes. All of these misunderstandings colour his theory which doesn't, then, stand up to more rigorous interrogation.Marlowe's use of Machiavelli in his dramas (which Nicholl makes much of) needs to be contextualised against the plethora of literary mentions of Machiavelli (e.g. Shakespeare's Edmund in King Lear) and seen as a cultural marker rather than an indication, necessarily, of Marlowe's own political beliefs.Although I enjoyed reading this, I felt that the story became more fevered and insubstantial as it drew towards the end and the final conclusion (I was reading the 1992 edition which I understand has now been revised) I personally found unbelievable. That anyone should target Marlowe as a stand-in for a more powerful rival seems unnecessary given the politics of the time and the supposed perpetrator is hardly a man known for his political subtleties... It makes the whole story ultimately extremely convoluted which I found unconvincing.So if you're interested in a clever archival search which delves deep into the Elizabethan underworld, then this is a good read. But I think there are still stories about Marlowe and others to be uncovered."}, {"userName": "Kathleen Fowler", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3560723-kathleen-fowler", "userReview": "Nicholl makes a very strong case for his theory of political intrigue as the motivation behind the murder of Elizabethan playwright Christopher Marlowe. Nicholl\u2019s scholarly and convincing arguments notwithstanding, I find in my 2000 edition of The Oxford Guide to English Literature that \u201cMarlowe died in a knife fight in a London tavern.\u201d Old myths die hard.The Elizabethan era was a brutal one. The plague was claiming hundreds of victims annually, the antagonism between Catholics and Protestants was escalating, England was mired in a seemingly endless conflict with Spain, there was a growing resentment of the large immigrant population of London, and the question of the succession to the throne loomed large since the aging Elizabeth had no heir. In many ways this society bears a striking resemblance to that of America today. It was highly polarized along religious, political, class, and ethnic lines. Huge amounts of resources were being poured into international conflicts. In such an environment conspiracies abounded, spying was rampant, compromise was viewed as weakness, and the ends were considered to justify any and all means. For a man of humble origins with literary aspirations, like Marlowe, undercover work could provide a financial safety net, as well as an entr\u00e9e to the circles of wealthy and powerful potential patrons.Nicholl lucidly presents well-researched, well-documented evidence for his interpretation of the events surrounding Marlowe\u2019s death.

Using the same technique that a classical era detective might apply to traces of a crime, but without bringing in a man with a gun, Nicholl makes the reader aware of a lot of Elizabethan history not usually mentioned in the history books, but true nevertheless. The Elizabethan age turns out to have been a highly unstable one, with Catholic Spain a constant threat, and men died in the Cold War being raged. One of them was Marlowe, the most gifted of all Elizabethan authors. One of the survivors was Shakespeare, a much more cautious man. This is a great piece of investigative history writing, and well worth the effort to come to grips with a very different age, which has yet many similarities with the one we live in."}, {"userName": "Larry", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1512686-larry", "userReview": "This is essential reading for anyone interested in Elizabethan Theater and the enigma that was Christopher Marlowe.

It inspired a desperate desire to know as much as possible about Marlowe and the dangerous times in which he lived.Coming back to Nicholl's book years later, and I'm a little less impressed. My research has suggested a couple of points which should have been obvious to Nicholl but which he misses. Most of his lines of enquiry now seem to me to stop before they start.But I would still thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery, is interested in the Tudor period and, most of all, is interested in Marlowe.

This book changed my life. After reading it, I confirmed to myself that I wanted to embark on the Renaissance studies program that I continue to enjoy.An utterly addictive read into what happened to Marlowe. For centuries, we all assumed that we would never know the true reasons behind Marlowe's murder, or worse yet, believed the establishment line that he was killed in a barroom brawl over a tab. Then, this book emerged in the early 90s and blew open the investigation. Newly discovered documents on the Elizabethan spy networks uncovered the fact that not only was Marlowe a notorious atheist and homosexual, but he was also a double, perhaps even triple agent, in Elizabethan spy wars over religious disagreements. The arguments are compelling and addictive to read, the questioning of the official findings reveals a coverup, and once we are finished with this account, we realize that poor Marlowe was set up. Now the established and accepted story of Marlowe's death in academic circles, this book is crucial to you if you are reading this review in enquiry over Marlowe and Renaissance culture.

It found that that during a scuffle the blade of a 12 penny dagger entered Marlowe's forehead making a wound two inches deep and one inch wide, killing him instantly.Beyond these facts Nicholl points out that much that has been taken as fact should to be re-examined. The four people present at the death, Marlowe included, were all in some way involved in shadowy intelligence war being fought between the Protestant government and Catholic groups at the time. These were men of changeable allegiance; swindlers and liars whose only motivation was profit and survival. Nicholl's presents details from records and documents of the time in order to support his argument that the testimony of the three survivors of the scuffle should be called into question and that more was behind their meeting than a simple meal.Throughout this Marlowe himself remains an elusive figure. Of his motivation Nicholl's can only guess, his work for the government as a spy against the Catholic cause and rumoured atheism, and the tone of his works, set up a contradiction that Nicholl can not explain. This said, the result of Nicholl's work has much to recommend it. The book is a well balanced mix of literary criticism and historical research which presents a vivid depiction of a brutal society in which torture and public execution were commonly used by the government. The clear presentation of so many fascinating details of Elizabethan life and the facts surrounding the political and religious workings of the state at the time, (such as the entrapment that lead to the death of Mary Queen of Scots and her supporters) make for compulsive reading, not only for students of the Renaissance."}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30902577-brandon", "userReview": "An extensively, well researched book centered around the murder of Kit Marlowe in a lodging house in Deptford. This is one of the great literary mysteries of both England and the world surrounded by shadows and numerous questions - Why, was he murdered? Did it have to happen? Could the man with the gentle soul of a poet really get into a knife fight over a bill? These are the questions that ran through my mind as I opened this book but unfortunately none of them were answered. The book open and closes with the murder of Marlowe but the pages in between have little to do with the subject. Instead we are given a heavy in depth analysis of the Elizabethan spy apparatus through the life and careers of people who had some connection to Marlowe and some brief descriptions of Marlowe actions as a spy that lack detail. The break down of the spy network is interesting enough reading although it can get a little heavy and the links to Marlowe and his murder can seem to much of a stretch. Also I found the many players on this stage and the multiple plots and deceptions left my mind a little numb. But in the end the casual and professional relationships Marlowe had with the many people in this book made me feel that the writer was stretching a too much to make all the parts fit.It seemed to me that the writer, while researching the murder of Marlowe, found a different book in the process; A history of the Elizabethan spy apparatus. But because he wanted to focus on the murder of Marlowe he underserves both subjects and it left me wanting. Christopher Nicholl would have been better advised to write two separate books and thus give the reader a more rounded picture of both topics instead he has a brilliantly researched and detailed book that only gives us a sketch of both the murder and knaves and scoundrels that were the players on this stage."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Hollman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31176723-jeffrey-hollman", "userReview": "Christopher Marlowe may have been as great as his younger contemporary, William Shakespeare,had he not been murdered at such a young age in 1593. A great playwright before his death, his life was about as complicated as they come. This book begins with his killing in a bar and then goes on to discuss the Elizabethan age with details I had not previously learned.For example, Catholics were as suspect in England as Communists were in 1950's America. If a person were Catholic, his life was at risk. The Elizabethan secret service led by Walsingham hunted Catholics ruthlessly because Catholic governments in Europe had vowed to depose the Protestant Elizabeth. One of the suppositions about Marlowe's killing was that he was assassinated because he may have been a Catholic spy. Nicholl describes many other aspects of the tumultuous London society, how dangerous the streets could be. In 1589, Marlowe and poet friend themselves were arrested after a street brawl that left a third man dead.The book is nonfiction but reads like a murder mystery.

He shows that Christopher Marlowe was not killed in a drunken tavern brawl but rather at the end of a small day-long meeting in an upscale lodging house.
