(1936). ****.\tThis is the third and final novel in Dos Passos\u2019 trilogy, \u201cUSA.\u201d It is the longest novel of the three, but the one in which the selected characters are more fully explored. The author continues his examination of America and its peoples, this time in the period just after WW I up to about 1925. Times were hard for lots of reasons and jobs were scarce. Although this was the time of the Roaring Twenties, the glitter was only on the surface. Dos Passos follows the lives of only four of his twelve characters: Charley Anderson, Mary French, Margo Dowling, and Richard Ellwsorth Savage. All of them are struggling to make their respective ways in the post-war environment. Of particular interest is the character Charley Anderson, who believes in the American dream of starting his own business, with a wartime buddy as a partner, and making it big by exploiting his ideas for new technology for aviation \u2013 a field that was in its infancy. Dos Passos still obviously leans towards the left in his sympathies and has nothing good to say about the capitalistic system that was in place. He believes, as he certainly makes clear through the stories of his characters, that workers were there to be exploited by management and the money men. Of particular interest are the author\u2019s mini-biographies of notable people of the times that are inserted between chapters carrying on the stories of his characters. In this book he takes a close look at Frederick Winslow Taylor \u2013 a name I\u2019d never heard \u2013 who was the founder of the \u201cscientific method\u201d of measuring work efficiency. The workshop was never the same after Taylor. Other notables include Henry Ford, a classic character, Thorstein Veblen, a shy professor with some penetrating perceptive ideas, Isadora Duncan, and Rudolph Valentino. There are others, but I named just a few. Dos Passos continues his use of \u201cHeadlines\u201d to provide a timeline for the reader and a sense of what was happening out in the real, reportable world. As long as you understand that this novel represents a coninuing saga within a larger work and that there is no beginning and no end to the characters \u2013 although there is certainly resolution for each character, the book can be read as a stand-alone work. However you come to it, I think you will find it worthwhile.

This book (the entire trilogy really) is great writing, great history, and an excellent reminder that there really is nothing new under the sun. The lives of the characters and the times they live in (political unrest, class struggle, get rich quick schemes, war, xenophobia, etc) ring true today. The slang, however, has changed.

Well, that's what happened to me with John Dos Passos's U.S.A. trilogy.For those who aren't familiar with this trilogy, its novelty is in its form. Dos Passos, an American Modernist and contemporary of Hemingway, Faulkner, Stein and the rest of that expat cadre, has assembled something less like a novel and more like a collaged portrait of the United States during three consecutive periods of history: The 42nd Parallel deals with the early years of the 20th century; 1919 is concerned with the American experience of World War I; and The Big Money, the long-awaited (to me) capstone of the trilogy, is concerned with the boom years following the War, during which America was hurtling unknowingly toward the Great Depression. (All three were written during the Great Depression, fro 1930 to 1936, so the shadow of coming events looms large over them, especially the last one.) The novels in the series share a common structure: they are composed of four different types of sections, which alternate unpredictably with one another like an improvisational jazz piece. The \"Newsreel\" sections are themselves collages, juxtapositions of newspaper headlines, contemporary speeches, and fragments of popular songs of the time. Dos Passos is excellent, I think, at giving a sense of the sweeping progress of history as found in the minutiae of the popular media, and also a sense of its myopia and the self-serving language of politics, advertising, and the press. Forgive the lengthy block quote, but I think the easiest way to explain the Newsreels is just to show you how they work:'Twarn't for powder and for storebought hairDe man I love would not gone nowhere\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if one should seek a simple explanation of his career it would doubtless be found in that extraordinary decision to forsake the ease of a clerkship for the wearying labor of a section hand.

These chapters are named for their main characters: \"Charley Anderson,\" \"Mary French.\" More on these later, but they probably make up between two-thirds and three-quarters of the text.In amongst the Newsreels and story elements, there are also \"Camera Eye\" sections, in which Dos Passos relates his own experience in stream-of-consciousness prose. This is his attempt to expose the ostensibly \"godlike\" authorial voice for what it was: just another human living his life. And finally, in addition to the Camera Eye sections, there are also poems scattered through the books which tell the stories of famous real-life people of the era: Henry Ford, Rudolph Valentino, William Randolph Hearst, Thorstein Veblen. These are truthfully my favorite parts of Dos Passos's trilogy; his poem on Eugene Debs in The 42nd Parallel convinced me I'd found a new favorite writer. I think what I love about them is Dos Passos's mixture of resignation, sadness and anger at how, time and time again, complex and contradictory humans let their vices and petty prejudices mar their own endeavors. From \"TIN LIZZIE,\" the poem on Henry Ford:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One thing he brought back from his trip\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0was the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He started a campaign to enlighten the world in the Dearborn Independent; the Jews were why the world wasn't like Wayne County, Michigan, in the old horse and buggy days;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Jews had started the war, Bolshevism, Darwinism, Marxism, Nietzsche, short skirts and lipstick. They were behind Wall Street and the international bankers, and the whiteslave traffic and the movies and the Supreme Court and ragtime and the illegal liquor business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Henry Ford denounced the Jews and ran for senator and sued the Chicago Tribune for libel,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and was the laughingstock of the kept metropolitan press;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but when the metropolitan bankers tried to horn in on his business\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he thoroughly outsmarted them.For Dos Passos, Ford's absurd, rabid racism and oddly obsessive provincial nostalgia (his desire that the whole world be \"like Wayne County, Michigan, in the old horse and buggy days\") coexists with a storyteller's appreciation of his business prowess and the epic change his cars created in the American landscape. Every person is simultaneously great and small, Dos Passos seems to be arguing; every person is at once admirable and hateful. The fact that Ford himself longed for old-fashioned quiet and simplicity, and spent his final years on a restored simulacrum of his father's farm, removed from the noise of his own automobiles, is just the kind of poignant, contradictory detail Dos Passos loves.The actual \"characters\" of U.S.A., the ones invented rather than just evoked by Dos Passos, who are the subjects of the trilogy's prose sections, come from a variety of backgrounds, but often work hard to end up in a different part of society than the one in which they started: working-class, middle-America Charley Anderson, for example, gifted with machines and a flying ace in WWI, starts his own aviation company with a friend and ends up wealthy, married to a society girl; meanwhile Mary French, daughter of the Main Line, goes against her mother's wishes and leaves college to be a union organizer and community activist. The common thread, however, is that no matter what Dos Passos characters decide they want, it seldom makes them happy, and they usually end up sabotaging their own efforts in one way or another. Indeed, the one uniting element of all the U.S.A. characters is that they are slaves to, and undone by, their vices, whether those be for sex, alcohol, social position, or money. The characters who do best both materially and psychologically, like actress Margo Dowling, are usually the most pragmatic, the ones who acknowledge that they're playing a survival game, and look out for themselves and (sometimes) those around them with an utter lack of romanticism. Margo has no grand illusions, especially once she passes the age of about twenty, and that saves her from the pathetic fate of those who keep telling themselves stories about who they are and what they want\u2014stories that get less true all the time. Former golden boy and flying ace Charley Anderson is a particularly pathetic example of the Dos Passos milieu: believing his every whim has a compelling reason behind it (that his lust is love, and his drunken well-being happiness), he descends ever-farther into debt, alienation and alcoholism while telling himself stories about his flying brilliance. Even the activist Mary French, who is probably closest to Dos Passos in her leftist outlook and untiring political work, becomes a victim of her own illusions as she falls in love with a series of condescending, emotionally unavailable fellow activists.This compulsion, in Dos Passos characters, to let their vices sabotage their dreams didn't bother me as much in the first two books as it did this time around, in The Big Money. I'm not sure if the series actually does become more bitter as it goes along, or whether I've become more sensitive in the ten years since reading the last two books\u2014my guess is that both might be true. It would certainly make sense that, as the country careens toward the crash of 1929, Dos Passos would become more condemnatory of the way Americans were behaving, since he laid the responsibility for the depression of the 1930s squarely on the shoulders of the irresponsible stock market speculators of the 1920s, and on American capitalism as a whole. And it's not that I don't relate to the pattern he lays out\u2014obviously it does happen, and it's a classic setup for a tragedy of the everyday. I just can't help believing that it doesn't happen to everyone\u2014that idealism and dreams, while dangerous as a sole frame of reference, can be an important asset if balanced by practicality. Despite my qualms about the uniformly miserable characters, though, I remain in awe of Dos Passos's technical verve and audacity, and I love the way he simultaneously creates a broad canvas of events on the national level, and an intimate canvas of regular individuals making their way."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2443692-mike", "userReview": "I'm so glad I finally got to read DosPassos. There's not much I can say about \"The Big Money\" (volume 3 of the USA trilogy) that hasn't already been said by all sorts of people much smarter than me, over the past several decades. In \"The Big Money\" DosPassos captures the spirit of a generation- the \"lost generation\"- as the lives of several characters intersect and intertwine in the years between the end of the First World War and the crash of 1929. Looking back from DosPassos' perspective at the time of writing, it seems like the 1929 crash and the ensuing Depression were a judgement, of sorts, on American society: paying the piper for years of crass materialism, empty satisfaction of material and physical wants (wealth, sex, and booze), and the betrayal of the American dream: no longer was wealth- even mere security- obtained through work and innovation; rather, through manipulation of financial markets and abuse of credit. (I know! I know! History is repeating itself!) There's nothing like a traditional plot here: DosPassos' characters simply drift through the decade, experiencing the base thrills and degradation that the America's economy and society had to offer. DosPassos uses some innovative techniques to tie everything together and provide social/political/economic context to the book- including \"Newsreel\" chapters containing snippets from headlines and news stories, stream-of-consciousness \"Camera Eye\" bits presenting his themes in stark relief, and- most interestingly- mini-biographies of prominent Americans of the era (Henry Ford, Frederick Taylor, Frank Lloyd Wright, others) who helped shape the first decades of \"The American Century.\" DosPassos uses the Sacco and Vanzetti case- with which he was personally involved- as a simulacrum of the demise of the American working class, and the ultimate victory of the financiers. Powerful stuff. I'm going to read more."}, {"userName": "Rafael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12075333-rafael", "userReview": "EUA, anos 20 do S\u00e9c.

I started reading the series because it kept showing up on lists of must-read 20th century literature. It probably belongs on them but not because it's especially profound or moving. Instead, it's a vivid picture (with a heavy socialist tint) of everyday American life in the years between McKinley's assassination and the stock market crash. Dos Passos employs an unusual narrative structure which has an almost Cubist effect, revealing the world from a variety of distances and perspectives. The bulk of the work is a set of chapters that each focus on one of about a dozen characters, telling their stories from childhood onward. These stories are punctuated by the so-called \"Newsreels,\" collages of headlines, news story fragments and snatches of lyrics of popular songs, that are sometimes reminiscent of Burroughs' fold-ins. The Newsreels provide both a sense of time and an immediate historical context. A deeper cultural and mythical context is provided by a set of biographies of important figures of the time beginning with Eugene Debs, proceeding through the likes of J.P. Morgan and Joe Hill, Henry Ford and Isadora Duncan, and ending with a nameless vagrant. Interspersed with these three narrative forms is a fourth obscure set of chapters that come under the heading \"Camera Eye\" and provide Dos Passos' impressions of various times of his own life. These are given without background or explanation but provide an immediacy absent from the rest of the book.The tone throughout the trilogy is one of sustained bitterness. The individual characters lead eventful, but troubled and unsatisfying lives- WWI is actually a bright spot for most of them- which is probably why Sartre held the series in high esteem. At the outset there is some hope in the goals of the Wobblies. But while they are prominent in The 42nd Parallel, they've faded to irrelevance by the beginning of the third book. This process was helped along by mass arrests by Woodrow Wilson, documented in his own biography titled \"Meester Veelson.\" This scathing chapter situated at the center of 1919 is in many ways the heart of the whole trilogy, highlighting Wilson's betrayal of his own ideals with a list of the efforts at reform he abandoned throughout his life. It is perhaps only outshined by the biography that appears at the end of 1919 titled \"The Body of an American Soldier.\" After the powerful conclusion of the second book, The Big Money initially felt perfunctory. I can't say that feeling completely disappeared by the end of the book, but Dos Passos managed to allay most of it by avoiding the predictable dramatic climax synchronized with the stock market crash. In fact, that event is barely mentioned in one of the last Newsreels. In the meantime, the stories of the various individual characters all sputter to unremarkable (though frequently premature) endings. The anger of the first two books is replaced with quiet resignation, which is probably the most fitting response to the first three decades of the 20th century in the United States."}, {"userName": "Jerjonji", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129056-jerjonji", "userReview": "I was barely 13 and reading the headiest book I\u2019d ever encountered: John Dos Passos\u2019 trilogy, USA.

Trilogy, is every bit as strong as the first two books, The 42nd Parallel and 1919. I'm probably doing Dos Passos a disservice by calling his trilogy ambitious. The word doesn't have enough sweep to effectively describe what Dos Passos did with these three books, which is to tell the story of the United States during the first three decades of the 20th century, its technological advancements, and what Dos Passos saw as its moral decline due to the decadence of the wealthy. The trilogy takes in World War I, the birth of aviation and motion pictures, union organizers, advertising, the stock market, Prohibition, the working class and the wealthy, and ends shortly before the market crash of 1929. The narrative is fragmented into four separate styles that complement and inform each other, allowing the trilogy to be both sweepingly general and highly specific: fictional stories of 12 characters whose lives occasionally intersect throughout the three books; collages of newspaper headlines, newsreel scripts, and popular song lyrics of the time period; short nonfiction biographies of famous Americans; and Joyce-inspired, impressionistic, semi-autobiographical stream-of-consciousness.

Sometimes I would have to remember that this wasn\u2019t a recently written work attempting to imagine the \u201cold days\u201d. Dos Passos was writing about his current period and attempting to capture the entire feel of the time. You have any interest in 1910-1931 America? Then you must read this trilogy. Otherwise, your interest isn\u2019t serious.

I guess that's what makes it so good-- it's unflinchingly honest about the sadness of the unfulfilled American Dream and the hypocrisies at the heart of the USA at this time."}, {"userName": "Marc Gerstein", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15102294-marc-gerstein", "userReview": "I think \u201cThe Big Money\u201d is the best of the \u201cU.S.A.\u201d trilogy (which includes \u201cThe 42nd Parallel\u201d and \u201c1919\u201d). I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because of the book itself or because of the way reading it with recollection of the prior (which I read in succession just before it) pulls the entire work together. Essentially, this is the great American epic; \u201cU.S.A.\u201d is actually a perfect overall title. It is, quite literally, the story of life in the USA. It focuses on three decades, the 1900s, the 1910s, and the 1920s in a way that could have been the 1850s, 1860s, 1870s; the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, or any period of time (or more than three decades if an author would have the wherewithal to do it). What\u2019s most significant is something some of the less favorable reviews missed; this is timeless, not dated. Once you tune into the grand scheme, its easy as you read to envision the whole thing being re-told with details from today. The scheme for the work is subtle and fascinating. At first, I wondered about Do Passos\u2019 seeming focus on one strata of society, the marginal or disaffected. But after having finished the trilogy, I now get it. I find it almost analogous to the scientific method, where you want to observe the impact of X on Y but you want to control for variations in A, B, C, etc. Each decade has its own flavor; the 1900s dominated by class strife and the emergence of the labor movement fading, as it ends, toward the theme of the next decade, which is the Great War, patriotism and loyalty with undercurrents of class struggle persisting (we see even now these underlays as the flavor of one decade doesn\u2019t fully end on the exact last date of that decade) and we see themes of the next decade (money, ambition, partying) taking shape. We also see the variety of ways these larger historical and institutional forces play out on a variety of individuals who start out more or less from the same point but wind up pursuing different paths and reaching different destinations based on \u2013 well, I suppose that\u2019s for us to figure out and debate; Innate characteristics? Small variations in environmental details? Luck? All of the above? Some of the above? And by the way, as we get this high-level big-picture vantage point, it\u2019s hard not to notice the workings of the old adage, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Parallels from what we saw then to what we see today are hard not to notice if one can avoid getting too wrapped up in details."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6087599-laura", "userReview": "An interesting but not very enjoyable read. I didn\u2019t really feel like there was any one main character in the book, and while the plot follows characters like Charley and Margo the most, the collage of newspaper headings, brief introductions to numerous famous Americans of the era, song snippets, etc., left me with the impression that it is meant to be AMERICA\u2019s story, more than that of any particular American. Or more specifically, the post-WWI to pre-stock market crash America. The 20\u2019s are an interesting time in American history, and Dos Passos really delves into the glamour and excess, the confidence of America after the war contrasted with the materialistic, doomed future. His characters are for the most part unhappy and not very likable (just my opinion of course) and are largely self-serving and slaves to their own weaknesses/vices. They also provide an interesting contrast between the idea of the American dream and the reality. (Charley, a war hero who makes his way into business, \u201cthe self made man,\u201d is also a drunk who uses and abuses women, and Margo, the pretty blond who heads west to become a movie star, was a victim of sexual abuse as a child and uses people relentlessly on her way to the top.) I did like how Dos Passos alludes to American \u201cmythic\u201d figures, like the Wright Brothers, Isadora Duncan, and Henry Ford. One of the most interesting is the description of the life and death of Rudolph Valentino, and the riots of crazed fans who immortalized him immediately after death. The description of his diseased body in contrast with his image of legendary, silver screen beauty is an interesting metaphor for myth versus the reality that lurks beneath. The newsreels included between sections were very interesting too, and could be viewed as a symbol of the media\u2019s role in that distortion between myth and reality. Many of the headlines that Dos Passos includes are sensational and ugly, but they also show how the press controls/filters what people see and remember of their era. In contrast, the stories of the individuals in The Big Money can be viewed as the realities behind the headlines. (Which is pretty bad considering it ends BEFORE the stock market crash and Great Depression. Yikes.) No wonder Ada says \u201cOh Mary [\u2026] I wish everybody wasn\u2019t so unhappy.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124585-chris", "userReview": "The Big Money is a very interesting and compelling novel that I'm glad to have read. It's actually the third book in the \"USA Trilogy\" following American culture through the first 3 decades of the 20th century (each novel covering one decade). The Big Money takes us through the 1920s.The style is experimental and at times a little odd because of that. Had I not been reading this as part of a class or with some notes to help guide me, I'm certain I would have missed a lot of the nuances.There are 4 different writing threads throughout the novel: * Lives (actual story arcs of fictional characters) * Biographies (mini-biographies of notable characters such as Ford, Hearst, and others) * Newsreels (snippets from newspaper, radio, pop culture and other elements\u2026pieced together poetically to convey a thought or thread) * Camera Eye (commentary on what's going on\u2026a sort of personal context outside of the story)The way the novel is pieced together is very intriguing and made for fun reading. It provides some very interesting insights into what social, political and cultural life was like during this timeframe. The size and content can certainly be daunting, but the presentation is in bite-sized chunks which makes it more manageable. Still, I would recommend you pay close attention and perhaps have a quick link to wikipedia or other reference material in order to get the full perspective. ****4 out of 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Joseph Durham", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18422734-joseph-durham", "userReview": "Of the John dos Passos trilogy: The Big Money ( USA., #3 ) has the best characterization, and story lines. This is contains a wide range of personalities and conditions. In many ways, the passions and controversies of our time existed then as well. With his use of the Camera Eye and the Newsreel, he captures the kaleidoscope nature of the modern age. These chapters capture in print the powerful impact of media: film and newsreel. If written in our times John Dos Passos would have tried to capture the internet, and social media. He also includes brief biographies of important individuals on the American public stage as these offer a deeper backdrop to the persons and events to his narrative.

All 3 volumes held my interest. The short bios of famous business innovators and the newsreels were fabulous and had the freedom of poetry. The character based sections worked like engrossing short stories and benefited from being progressively interconnected. The dialogue was fun and the presence of a beat-down revolutionary spirit throughout the volumes tied it all together. This series will stir up your working class rage and make you feel more leftist, although not without ample cynicism and growing distrust of all things human.

His sympathies are clear, but the complexities of the situation don\u2019t escape him and there's no strident hero of the working class coming through morally unscathed.
