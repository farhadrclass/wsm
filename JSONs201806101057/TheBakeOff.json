This is very much chic lit, a fast fluffy read or a book to take to occupy a couple of hours. This book probably won't remain in memory for long or hit the top ten lists but it is a good read anyways. Amy and Linnie are sisters, but there is all they have in common. Linnie was declared a genius at age 6 and quickly left childhood behind while Amy was the popular fun sister. Years go by and they grow further away from each other. That is until Grammy decides they need to make up, so with a little meddling from her they enter a baking contest. Only problem is they don't know how to bake and don't forget they don't get along. There are some LOL moments along the way, some heart breaking moments and good pie at the end of the book"}, {"userName": "BJ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4690460-bj", "userReview": "\"The Bake-Off\" was a fun read, as are most by this author. This is the story of 2 sisters, Linnie and Amy. Linnie was a child prodigy gone \"bad\" and Amy is a dental hygienist, wife, and mother of twins. They have been long estranged for many reasons, but they have a sneaky grandma who tricks them into doing a pie-baking contest together to try to make them into BFFs. The problem, in addition to the fact that they don't get along is that neither one can bake! Its a comedy of errors with some maturing and growing up in the background. It's a story of family, especially sisters, baking, and a little romance.

In an effort to reclaim stolen property Linnie will do just about anything, including reconcile her past and set aside her differences with Amy. Unfortunately for Linnie her social awkwardness is almost more than her sister Amy can deal with. Throw in conniving competition, a time-honored family pie, a gorgeous wealthy hotel owner and you\u2019ve got the recipe for a perfect disaster or perhaps a spectacular story.This truly was such a fun read. It had all the enjoyable elements that make a great Chick Lit book fantastic. From a sisterhood rivalry to a romantic rendezvous with a gorgeous but very intelligent leading man to a wonderful variety of locations, the entire book was the perfect read for a great getaway afternoon. One of the things I absolutely adore is when a book can make a food theme work and Beth Kendrick truly does. It\u2019s not because it\u2019s the focal point, but more of a setting or feeling that runs through the pages of the book. As if you could smell the baking pies coming from the pages of the book much the way you do when you smell a baking pie in your home, you know it\u2019s there baking away but you\u2019re not mixing the ingredients together. Perfectly done!In addition to the food related aspects of the book being well done, I thought the relationship between Amy and Linnie was just the right mix of believable. Linnie grew up a tested genius and was driven from competition to competition until she entered college at fourteen. After the abrupt end to her college career only one year later she decides to quite the \u201cgenius role\u201d and ends up dealing blackjack in Vegas until she\u2019s nearly 30. Amy on the other hand has lived a relatively normal life with the exception of performing in a rock band in college, is now married with two children and is a dental hygienist. Obviously, I related a bit more to Amy being that she\u2019s a mom and still has trouble playing the balancing act that comes with that territory, but still loved both characters. Linnie\u2019s neurotic behavior though is what really propels the story and the dynamic between the two. Her constant checking of logistics and weighing of statistical probabilities is a constant thorn in Amy\u2019s side, but proves to pay off in the end not only for the baking competition but the sister\u2019s relationship as well.Though I related to Amy much better, it was Linnie\u2019s story that remained the primary focal point of the story which in a way is kind of ironic. Amy always hated the focus that was placed on Linnie because of her genius abilities, but Linnie resented her sister\u2019s freedom. In the end it was Linnie who needed to break away and become the person she had been stifling herself against for years. Much of this was aided through her complex relationship with Cam, the handsome hotel owner who unexpectedly sweeps her off her feet. I loved their interaction and how it helped Linnie to let down her guard, becoming a more relaxed version of herself.The Bake-Off by Beth Kendrick is the perfect summer read! If you\u2019re a Chick Lit fan who may also indulge in the occasional baking competition show on TLC, loves a great sister story or just simply loves to be swept off your feet than you need to pick up The Bake-Off. It\u2019s not necessarily a book that\u2019s going to have you rethinking your life or making major changes, but it was certainly the perfect getaway read. Knowing now that I loved this story so much and also being aware that Kendrick has written several other novels, I\u2019m making my way to my bookstore to pick up a few of her other books for just the right time.Originally reviewed and copyrighted at Chick Lit Reviews."}, {"userName": "Moonshadow1900", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44242761-moonshadow1900", "userReview": "I like her work.

Kendrick immediately drew me into the Bialeks\u2019 world with tales of Linnie\u2019s unfulfilling life in Vegas and Amy\u2019s frazzled days in Connecticut. Each woman was sympathetic, colorful, interesting \u2014 a fully fleshed-out and compelling character. I could sense the discord between them \u2014 anyone could, of course \u2014 but there was something tangible beneath the surface: love. And a sense that they wanted to repair what was broken between them . . . but didn\u2019t know how.Enter Grammy Syl. What a lovable, hilarious woman \u2014 and a devoted matriarch of their family. Syl\u2019s undying hope that her granddaughters would reunite is endearing even when it seems ill-advised, and I could definitely imagine a determined grandmother scheming to bring her family back together in just this way. It seems like the tension between Amy and Linnie is insurmountable, but is it? I didn\u2019t want to think so. Kendrick does a wonderful job of making the issues real without overwhelming us with drama.In fact, for a novel about a baking competition, the drama was anything but cheesy; it was fun. After the sisters arrive to make with the famous szarlotka, their competition is willing to do anything for a cut of the $100,000 grand prize. Tai and Ty Tottenham are The Bake-Off\u2019s villains \u2014 a husband and wife duo not averse to sabotage. Watching Linnie and Amy navigate around them was very amusing.At the heart of the story, though, is the apple pie that brings the girls together \u2014 and my mouth was watering at descriptions of the perfect crust and tart filling. Amy and Linnie\u2019s relationship progressed beautifully and left me feeling tender and warmhearted for my own sibling, and I think that\u2019s what Kendrick would want. Though I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the love story that developed partway through, it didn\u2019t bother me much. My eye was on that pie.Fans of women\u2019s fiction, foodie fiction and novels about sisters will delight in Kendrick\u2019s descriptions, vivid characters and fast-paced, hilarious dialogue. A book that often had me laughing aloud \u2014 and wiping away a tear at points.

However, instead of only seeing food contestants in the midst of a food challenge, Kendrick brings us up close and personal inside the lives of two contestants: estranged sisters Amy and Linnie.When their Grammy Syl cooks up a plot to get the two of them in the same city for the first time in years, both sisters hesitate. After all, anything they do together ends up terribly. Linnie, once a child prodigy who entered college at 16, threw it all away after one semester. Amy, a dental hygienist at her husband's dental practice and mother of twin toddlers, lost herself long ago to diapers and laundry. Linnie has never even met Amy's children; they organize family get-togethers around one another's schedules to avoid being in the same place at the same time.Szarlotka, via FlickrBut Linnie needs money, and Amy needs excitement. So the two end up as partners in the Delicious Duet baking contest, a dessert challenge in which the winners receive $100,000. Initially, neither sister can bake. In fact, they are somewhat of a disaster in the kitchen. But armed with Grammy's szarlotka recipe (and after several days of baking boot camp thanks to Grammy), they actually begin to stand a chance at winning.The Bake-Off is a fast and fun read, especially if you are both a reader and a foodie. I could watch Food Network 24 hours a day, and you know how much I love to read. So the two combined together is a nice treat. The characters are likeable, the plot fun, and Kendrick even includes recipes!

It was really funny and I loved the quirkiness of the two sisters. The genius, brainy sister reminded me a lot of the Temperance Brennan character from the TV show \u201cBones\". She is so busy being analytical and taking things literally that she doesn\u2019t see when she is socially inept.I liked how the author delved into the completely different personalities and lifestyles of the two sisters. We learn early on that there was a huge rift between the two of them and hadn\u2019t talked or interacted in years. I had a little bit of a hard that time that almost immediately after being thrown into the baking competition they bonded and started getting along and never discussed what had happened. One thing I couldn\u2019t figure out is that the brainy sister had lost all her money in a poker game and had entered the competition to win the prize money. And yet she flew from Las Vegas to New York twice before the competition, and then once for the competition, the sisters are sleeping in a luxury suite that is a couple thousand dollars a night, the sisters take a last minute flight roundtrip flight to Vegas (super pricey) and she buys an expensive gift -- where the heck is all this money coming from??I wished the story told more about the contestants in the baking competition. We are introduced to several other characters through the books but then they fall through the sifter and you never find out anything than a surface knowledge. I thought it would be fun to find out that the \u201cvillains\u201d were actually misunderstood and it was another contestant all along that was setting them up to take the fall."}, {"userName": "Kristy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2450583-kristy", "userReview": "I was skeptical of the book at first, and then about midway through the book, I could not put it down! I loved how Kendrick started off with setting the plot and then sucked you in, wanting more. This book was comparable to a soap opera you just didn't want to end! I loved the relationship between Linnie and Amy, how they went from being the sisters who were more rivals then friends; to being two women who resolved their issues, and more importantly their bond that they once had. In many ways it reminded me of that special attachment that I have with my own sister, and how when we are together there is never a dull moment. Linnie and Amy reminded me of us in many ways. It made the story even better when the author threw the crazy old grandmother, and the casanova boyfriend into the picture. I hope at some point there will be a sequel! Here are a couple of the quotes that I liked:\" When Linnie arrived at Cam McMillan's pent house she had two uncomfortable realizations\". 1. \" The sales tag was still attached to her underwear and digging into her hip\".2. \" She had no idea what she was going to say when he opened the door\" p.207 (I think everyone goes through those moments when they first like a guy)\"We stick together and get things done.

So when I read the summary for The Bake-Off I was anxious to get my hands on a copy. I\u2019ve enjoyed several culinary-related mysteries but this one was a bit different as there\u2019s no real mystery involved (well, there is a side story with some rival contestants). The story is about two sisters who are tricked by their grandmother into entering a baking competition with hopes that it will end their long-standing rivalry. Both are reluctant to go as neither knows how to bake, however the need for the prize money by one sister and the desire by the other to escape her life with two young children for a few days, means they both end up together where they face the truth about who they were and who they have become and eventually, the issues surrounding the cause of their rivalry decades before. While parts of the story are somewhat predictable, this is a very enjoyable, light read that will have you cheering for both sisters in the end! Beth Kendrick's style is easy to read and humorous at times. She's found a new fan in me. And the extra bonus?
