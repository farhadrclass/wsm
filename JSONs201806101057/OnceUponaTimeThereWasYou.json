The bad news is I took some issues with it. You have a divorced couple with a single daughter, Sadie. Irene and John never wanted to get married and somehow made it work for 8 years before they officially called it quits. Sadie gets into some trouble (which I had major issues with) and her parents have to come together to what? I guess I just don't understand the point of this book. None of the characters grew at all and Irene (the mother/ex-wife) was so annoying I almost threw this book across the room. What a selfish, know it all. The daughter was also a prat-- her \"trouble\" was ridiculously unbelievable. I actually appreciated the plot point that threw me off so early on in the novel, however based on how that turned out I quickly threw it in the trash because that's how garbage it was. It's almost as though the author came up with some crazy threads because she needed something to throw in to keep the reader interested. Oh, also the whole boyfriend storyline was equally ridiculous. I'm glad to be finished with this one, and couldn't recommend it in good conscious."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/883089-kathleen", "userReview": "I used to love Elizabeth Berg's books, eagerly awaiting the publication of each novel and then snatching it off the shelf to read immediately. The last few have been less than stellar and sadly, Once Upon a Time, There Was You continues the slide. A disjointed book at best, this novel tells the story of Irene and John, divorced some years now, who are brought back together by a tragedy involving their daughter, Sadie, who is 18. Both Irene and John are selfish, self-absorbed and dull, dull, deadly dull.The tragedy involving Sadie is a crime and as phoney/baloney as you can imagine, both in what happens and in her reaction to it. The irony is supposed to be that Sadie is wiser about life and marriage than her parents, but that only results in Sadie and her year older boyfriend/husband coming off as the fakest teens ever every time they open their mouths.I think this needed a serious edit. There were unresolved plot lines, characters that seemed extraneous and the most ridiculous amount of use of the word banquette ever! (I mean, not more times than in any book I ever read before, but crammed into this book more than in all the other books I have read combined)!Avoid this one and go back to Ms. Berg's earlier work."}, {"userName": "Melissa Acuna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3445700-melissa-acuna", "userReview": "Elizabeth Berg novels are usually enjoyable because of the interesting character development and insights into human motivation and psychology. This story included completely unlikable characters, implausible decisions and plot contrivances and required complete suspension of disbelief. Irene and John should never have gotten married, never told each other that they loved each other while married, despite evidence that at one time they did love each other. They are now divorced and living thousands of miles apart but raising a pretty cool, 18 year old, Sophie. Sophie gets kidnapped by a crazy dude. She's rescued because her boyfriend just happened to see her get into the crazy dude's car and memorized the license plate. After police questioning, she doesn't call her parents (she's now been gone for two days, and her mom has filed a missing person report with the police), but instead elopes with her 18 year old boyfriend......All in all, the only upside to this book is that it was a quick read."}, {"userName": "Sheila DeChantal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3286370-sheila-dechantal", "userReview": "As I continue my way through the works of Elizabeth Berg I found myself with her newest release, Once Upon A Time There was You. I felt almost from the beginning that this book was going to be predictable. A few pages in, I felt as though I knew how it would all end and with a resigned sigh, I proceeded deeper into the book.It made me, and hopefully you as well, happy to know I was wrong.Irene was not a strong woman. She was self conscious about her body, her age, and the fact that her daughter soon would go off to college and she would be alone. Irene dated yes, but never really connected with anyone. Even her best friend Valerie said that Irene was restless... never satisfied with just staying put.  \"It's like you're all the time digging in the tomato bin, saying, 'Where are the apples?'\" ~ Valerie to Irene page 276And John was actually the more likable of the once couple. He was calm, patient, and thought before he spoke, unlike Irene who's every emotion ran right out her mouth.Really though, this book centers around Sadie and Sadie's \"happening\" is the plot of this book, and I have to say, a weak plot at that. What happened to Sadie could have been quite a powerful story line. In fact when it was happening I was thinking whoa.... this is going to really be explosive of how the book moves forward.But...it wasn't.And so the book moves on from this point and I along with it, wondering what big thing would happen.... but alas, did not.As I turned the last page (actually I really did turn the last page because I did not realize it was the last page...) I do not know if I had a full sense of closure. Yes, most of the story was brought full circle, but in the end... it felt.... incomplete to me.An enjoyable light read. Nothing more."}, {"userName": "K.M.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5043943-k-m", "userReview": "This book is by one of my favorite authors, so it pains me to tell you that it\u2019s a huge disappointment. I wasn\u2019t even sure what it was about for a long time, but think it\u2019s supposed to be telling a coming of age story of Sadie, and how her (divorced) parents Irene and John deal with her process of separating from them and becoming an adult. The problem is that there are so many sidetracks that really do nothing at all to move the story forward, and worse, are boring. They drag it down. There is a proliferation of extraneous information that presumably is in there to help you get to know the characters better, but really it\u2019s more like dense underbrush that made me long for a scythe to just cut it all away and get to the point, already. The John and Amy story line was sort of interesting, but that\u2019s it really. None of the characters are particularly likeable. Some of the scenes, like the \u201cstrip scene\u201d between Irene and her best friend Val (and what a strip scene is doing in a book by Berg in the first place I have no idea) are just ridiculous; it\u2019s very hard to imagine that it could every really happen. Skip this one. The Last Time I Saw You (also by Berg) is excellent; read that instead."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1147634-alex", "userReview": "At First Sight: At age 36, John and Irene got married against their better judgement, mostly because they were growing older and didn't want to be alone. But neither of them had a good example to follow, both coming from broken homes and with less than ideal mother figures. So it's no surprise that 20 years later they are divorced and living at different ends of the country - Irene in San Francisco and John in San Paul- with only their 18 year old daughter Sadie as a link between them. While Irene has become a bit of a serial dater in the years since the divorce, afraid of being alone; John never quite dated until very recently. But they surprisingly think quite often of each other. And when their daughter's impulsive decisions force them to be together for a while, they can't help exploring the marriage they left behind, where they went wrong and the things they did right. Second Glance: I'm not exactly sure how I feel about Once Upon a Time, There Was You, I think that it had been written by a man it would be called \"Literary Fiction\" and I'm not sure I'm a literary fiction kind of girl, but I'm sure that this neither is Chick Lit or a contemporary romance or anything like that. I can't even really call it Woman's Fiction because John's point of view is both important and takes about a third of the book.The narrative alternates between Irene, John and Sadie and I have to say that I found that quite distracting, further more I found the plot to be a bit flat. It's so grounded and so day-to-day that there is very little spark to the story.The most interesting parts were the ones that had to do with John and Irene's pasts, at least for me, and I wasn't really interested in their current lives. Sadie, I thought I was going to like her at first but I didn't, not really. I did like the guy she was dating, and that was something but not much.Bottom Line: This is not a lighthearted, easy to read story. If you're looking for something realistic and a bit complex, this might be your type of read, but I don't see myself going back to this type of book any time soon. The writing is quite decent though."}, {"userName": "Deb (Readerbuzz) Nance", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance", "userReview": "Elizabeth Berg, your first half-dozen books were keepers for me; I could read lines from these books over and over again and they would make me cry and laugh at the same time, every time. Not so your last three novels. (I feel terribly sad telling you this. Yet I feel I must tell you this.) You start with a promising premise: A man and woman marry, both feeling great misgivings about the wedding, and later divorce. But it never felt like you loved these characters like I felt you loved your characters in past books. And that's what I thought was missing from the last few books. I probably will continue to try your novels, but if it continues to feel like you are just going through the motions, I probably won't finish them. (Please know that I write this painful review only because I loved your first books so much.) Honestly, the design of the cover is the best part of this book."}, {"userName": "Tmholland38", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5335253-tmholland38", "userReview": "I haven't read any of Elizabeth Berg's other works but I have to admit that despite the praise, I'm not overly impressed. Everything about this book seemed to just fall a little short. I felt like what could have been a very poignant story about the mistakes of life, finding your true self and the complexity and raw emotion of being a parent was turned into a rushed, glossy version that had to remain under 300 pages. Over the first few chapters, I was expecting a rock climbing accident or a car accident that would kill the boyfriend or severely injure the daughter. Instead she gets into a stranger's car, is kidnapped, and held in an abandoned shed only to be rescued by the police before any real \"harm\" comes to her because her boyfriend happened to drive up as she got into the car and got the license plate number. I mean, really? Even as far-fetched as that was, the focus then becomes the fact that Sadie got married. How can there never be a true exploration of how this affects Sadie, other than her panic the first time she is alone? How can you pass over the parents fears and emotions of almost losing their daughter? Those surely don't go away just because she's home. If anything, the truth of what could have been would have been larger than life. Then on top of that, throw in the Irene's eternal online dating and John's fledgling relationship with Amy whom me mistakenly met at a surviving spouse's support group. Despite all of the criticism, I didn't dislike the book. It was ok. It was just disappointing to see the seeds of what could have truly been a deeply moving and profound story and finish knowing that they failed to grow."}, {"userName": "Roberta", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/304453-roberta", "userReview": "This was my first Elizabeth Berg book. I chose it because it was one the few audiobooks available on the library website whose description appealed to me. On the positive side, I was engrossed while listening to it. I like her style and flow. However, I found the plot to be totally unrealistic. First of all, I found it really cowardly that Berg chose to make Sophie's \"trauma\" so innocuous. Really - if you don't have the heart to create a really traumatic scene, don't write one at all. The abduction was so lame. What purpose did it serve? There was no follow-up. No trial. Why would he abduct her and then just leave her there? It made no sense whatsoever. Then, Sophie's reaction to it! What? I think Elizabeth Berg was totally out-of-touch with what a real 18 year-old would do. I consulted a panel of experts - the 18 year-old daughters of my friends. To a girl, they agreed that they would not have called Ron from the police station, that they would've called their dads. Not a one of them would've gone to hang out in the park for a while. My initial reaction was that I would've felt dirty, both physically and emotionally, and I would've wanted to get in a hot shower as soon as humanly possible. I don't think I'd be wanting to hang out for a while and then go get married.

She has written some of my favorite novels. This was good but just did not seem to be as good as some things that I have read by her in the past such as, Open House (I loved this one) and Talk Before Sleep ( I didn't think I would stop crying when I read this).The one factor that all of the works, that I have read, by Berg have in common is that the emotions the characters have are so authentic or realistic. While I found Irene to be prickly and a little hard to like, at times, I could certainly relate to the way she loved her daughter and wanted only good things for her.I could also sympathize with Sadie. She does something incredibly foolhardy and as a parent I was screaming at her don't don't don't but there is part of me that can still relate to that trusting 18 year old and remember how it was to not really be able to feel that anything truly bad could happen to me.While parts of this book were hard to concentrate through, I could really relate to the characters.

Even on their wedding day, John and Irene had serious reservations whether they were doing the right thing. But their plans were made and they did what was expected of them. Now divorced and living in different parts of the country, the one thing they have in common is their mutual love for their eighteen-year-old daughter, Sadie. Sadie lives with her mother in San Francisco, John lives in their original home state, Minnesota. Four times a year Sadie visits her father, mostly in Minnesota, but sometimes he comes to California. She\u2019s a bright girl, itching to be on her own. It\u2019s late summer when the story takes place, and Sadie is looking forward to college and independence.Irene passionately loves her daughter, knows it\u2019s time to begin letting go, but is finding it hard to accept that Sadie will soon be on her own. The empty nest is looming, but she\u2019s not ready to let it happen. John, as the absent parent, is seen at the \u201cgood guy,\u201d someone Sadie can confide in, and sometimes Sadie can get him to intercede for her with her mother.Sadie has a boyfriend, Ron, whom she\u2019s dated on several occasions, but hasn\u2019t yet introduced to her mother. She\u2019s asked her mother\u2019s permission to go on a rock climb, but with no success. Rock climbing isn\u2019t something Irene could imagine anyone doing and she can\u2019t fathom why Sadie would want to do such a dangerous thing. At Sadie\u2019s request, John talks to Irene, who reluctantly gives in. Sadie has actually made other plans, the rock climb is a ruse, but her clandestine plan backfires. When tragedy strikes, Irene and John come together to support Sadie.Author Elizabeth Berg\u2019s character development is superb. Like them or not, her characters ring true, flaws and all. The story is a portrayal of love: love between man and woman, love toward their child, and the sometimes spotty love a child has for her parents.

On their wedding day both John and Irene realize they should not get married, but they go ahead. Years later, divorced, they are brought back together to deal with a crisis involving their 18-year-old daughter Sadie. John lives in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Irene and Sadie live in San Francisco. Most of the questions raised in this novel are about marriage. Why do some marriages succeed and others fail? Can you be too young to marry successfully? -- or too old? When should you tell your friends about problems you're having? -- and when should you keep it to yourself? There's a lot of other \"issues\" in this book, too: helicopter parents, kidnapping, personal ads, career choices, widowhood...What I love about Berg is how she drags us into the minds - the thoughts and memories - of her characters. I admire how they are able to remember small incidents or happenings to support an argument they are making in their conversations. When someone asks me to tell an anecdote or \"tell about a time when.....\", my mind always goes completely blank. These characters are not all admirable, but they have depth, and we can identify with their weaknesses as well as their strengths -- and we sympathize with them even when they screw up.

So many books I've read have had a terrible thing happen, and it rips apart the lives of anybody even loosely connected to that character. In this case, the repercussions of \"the event\" are widespread, but on a realistic level.The bad: When Sadie, the daughter of the main characters, undergoes her traumatic event, it is practically just another blip in the saga of John and Irene's failed marriage, and the ensuing years of failed communication. It is almost as though every chapter is just a discourse on why these two particular middle-aged adults are so dysfunctional, and their handling of their daughter's disappearance and the fallout just provides evidence to support that. Sure, maybe in real life not all similar events explode into a People magazine headline, but nor are there books written about all of them. I could better envision \"Once Upon a Time, There Was You\" as a short story that would be engrossing for all of its twenty pages."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1731678-nancy", "userReview": "Just did a re-read of this book (June 2018), after taking it out accidentally--and was happy to realize that I still really (really) liked it. Here's the old review (and I agree with all of it):I see that I'm in the minority in thinking this book was great. But I'm going to stick with five stars (four and a half?) because I enjoyed the book so thoroughly. You seldom get to read about relationships between people in older middle age-- and the conversations and details feel very real.The story at the center of the book: what happens to the primary characters' daughter, Sadie, and the aftermath of a terrifying event. I was hooked on the plot and the believable resolutions of all of the story's conflicts. It felt like a sweet, realistic story which offered hope and joy for some characters (often characters whose prospects were not predictably great)-- and change for others, without having an all-loose-ends-tied-up happy ending.I really like Elizabeth Berg's stories.

The few weeks a year when Sadie went to go visit her father never seemed to be enough for either of them. One day, Irene is frantic and calls John. There is a crisis involving Sadie. John leaves the new relationship that he has just started and rushes out to San Francisco. During the time that he is there staying with Irene, they begin to explore how they really feel about each other.Although Berg does a good job developing her characters I found the story to be a bit unbelievable.

Every little anecdote that was thrown in was more boring than the next, and not a single one made her into someone I could relate to. That's pretty remarkable, considering I'm a 50 something woman with teenagers in their last years of high school, just like her.

The last third of the book had too much talking-head relationship rumination for my taste. All the characters got a turn to talk to one of the others about how they felt. This didn't seem realistic. Everyone seemed to have far too much insight into their own and others' motivations and too much politeness and empathy. Real relationships are far more messy and not amenable to neat dissection.

If it weren't for that ending I am pretty sure I would have given this book a 4 (or 3). Yes I realize that an ending shouldn't affect my rating by such a large amount but it does. It does because for starters I was looking for a feel-good book, not one that would crush my heart into little pieces (let me say that the ending isn't actually sad, more like bitter sweet). The author had me so (slight exaggeration) emotionally invested in Irene and it sucks that Irene doesn't get the happy ending she deserves. It sucks that the author ended the book that way when I thought it would be heading in a completely different direction. It doesn't make sense at all. I really wish I could go back and unread this book because it's causing me so much pain right now. If Irene wasn't annoying enough (I still preferred her), I really didn't like Saddie. She was meant to come off as a wise soul I am guessing but that didn't work well because some of the things she did were completely selfish. John was just very flat and I really did not care about him. My point is that had the ending been different I might have overlooked the character or had a different take on them but because the book ended the way it did, I don't.

Geez!!\u201d Her incessant chatter and what I call whining was weighing heavily on my nerves. I kept thinking \u201cwhy?\u201d are John and Sadie trying so hard with Irene, she \u201ckept herself\u201d miserable and couldn\u2019t seem to pull herself out of this narcissistic, lonely, complaining place she was in. The story was well-written and any author who can evoke such involvement and emotion in me definitely gets my thumbs up!!"}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2519765-nicole", "userReview": "Nobody can write dialogue like Elizabeth Berg. She just gets how people talk, how they struggle to communicate their feelings and motivations, and how conversations can turn quickly and be misunderstood. She also can paint little vignettes, like a mom sharing a memory from her childhood with her daughter, that ring so true and real. I didn't give this book more stars, however, because the character of Sadie was just so annoying. Sadie's parents acted as if the sun set and rose on their wise (how many times was she called that?) and trust-worthy (hardly!) eighteen-year-old daughter, Sadie. Yet, Sadie made some really dumb, immature decisions and no one held her responsible for the consequences. When her mom objects to some of these decisions and tries to talk to her, bratty Sadie pulls \"it's my life\", then holes up in her room (that she doesn't pay rent for) and eats (food she doesn't pay for). She's just waiting to go to college (which her parents will pay for) while she hides important information from her ATM, I mean, parents. For her part, poor Mom is told by everyone that Sadie needs to grow up and away from her and to let go. Then, when wise Sadie gets in over her head, those same people tell Mom she is overreacting. That got old fast. That, and the last chapter that tied too many things up too easily. Even so, ignore Sadie and read this book for the way Berg writes. This book is worth the read."}, {"userName": "\u2665Xeni\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3584794-xeni", "userReview": "I read this book together with the Serious About Books group for August 2011. I wasn't sure if I wanted to read this book. Based on the cover it looks like a Nicholas Sparks novel (and there is always so much sadness in them!) and from the blurb it felt a bit like one too. But that really wasn't the case. This story taught me quite a bit about love, companionship, relationships, growing older and marriage. I felt so connected to the characters, even though the parents (John and Irene) are in their fifties, inside they had never really grown up, or grown together. I could identify less with Sadie, their daughter, although she's closer to my age. She is confidant and knows what she wants and reaches out to take it. That was never me. I felt a lot closer to Irene, who keeps screwing up each of her relationships and works too hard (at being a mother, and at her job). One thing that really amazed me was the story structure. I had thought (from the blurb) that the tragedy that Sadie endures would be the pivotal part of the story: everything leads up to it, and everything after it is affected by it. Yet, that wasn't the case. Any other author would have pushed this incident into the foreground, but Berg decided instead to focus on the positive relationships between everyone; to show how they mature and become the people they should have been. This book has given me more confidence to work with my own life. For once, I am really glad that the SAB group picked this book. :)"}], "description": "From the beloved New York Times bestselling author of Home Safe and The Last Time I Saw You comes a beautiful and moving novel about a man and woman, long divorced, who rediscover the power of love and family in the midst of an unthinkable crisis.\u00a0 Even on their wedding day, John and Irene sensed that they were about to make a mistake. Years later, divorced, dating other people, and living in different parts of the country, they seem to have nothing in common\u2014nothing except the most important person in each of their lives: Sadie, their spirited eighteen-year-old\u00a0 daughter. Feeling smothered by Irene and distanced from John, Sadie is growing more and more attached to her new boyfriend, Ron. When tragedy strikes, Irene and John come together to support the daughter they love so dearly. What takes longer is to remember how they really feel about each other. Elizabeth Berg has once again created characters who embody the many shades of the human spirit. Reading Berg\u2019s fiction allows us to reflect on our deepest emotions, and her gifts as a writer make Once Upon a Time, There Was You a wonderful novel about the power of love, the unshakeable bonds of family, and the beauty of second chances.", "title": "Once Upon a Time, There Was You", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8724520-once-upon-a-time-there-was-you", "average": 3.22, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320556116l/8724520.jpg", "reviews": 888, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3529.Elizabeth_Berg", "name": "Elizabeth Berg"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Contemporary", "Family", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8724520-once-upon-a-time-there-was-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9990283-once-upon-a-time-there-was-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18141851-era-uma-vez-tu", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5190.Open_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226858.What_We_Keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127395.The_Year_of_Pleasures", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127390.Talk_Before_Sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32918898-the-story-of-arthur-truluv", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
