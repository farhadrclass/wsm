Little confusing in that the book is out of publishing order due to the fact this was released as a set around halloween before coming out as a single. You do not need to understand #17   before this. Liked we hear more about Lugh's son. I hope he finds someone. The spin off series is interesting, are they the woman who we meet during the youngest brother being sick by hellhound or the ones we meet in this book?"}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40429899-monica", "userReview": "I had this in my TBR pile as owned but not read. I started to read it and I knew I read before...turns out I forgot to review it! Ha. Oopsy! This is the story of the black dragon Kyran and his mate Caitlin who is part banshee. Both were tortured by the Twins O'baoills. Both in different ways but have suffered tremendously. Kyran is so freaking stubborn though and I just never thought he'd get it together in the beginning. Caitlin never gave up on him though. They'd see it all through and mate and be happy! She was determined to save her dragon!"}, {"userName": "Rhi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7829692-rhi", "userReview": "Tears for her Dragon is part of Julia Mill's popular Dragon Guard series. I suggest for the highest emotional impact that you have read the previous books in the series. I have not read them all and while I enjoyed it, I'm almost certain I would have enjoyed this more had I done so. Kyran is a Black Dragon and was held prisoner by the evil hunters who tortured him. He escaped with the help of his brethren but has vowed vengeance on Eve - the head hunter and the one who has been experimenting on shifters. However, he's drawn from his cave to a secluded house where he meets Caitlyn. Caitlyn is blind, her only companion a german shepherd named Duke. Caitlyn is also his mate and another victim of the evil hunters. Together, they can take vengeance on the one responsible for their pain. There is a lot going on in this book and it is a fast book to read. If you've liked Ms. Mills other books in this series, than you will likely enjoy this. As with many of her books, I found that she moved a little too quickly for my tastes and I was often left confused as to who characters were and what their specific powers were. In fact, the pace was so quick that it seemed that events that happened that were supposed to lead to a confrontation or an issue were instead brushed aside. I didn't really feel an emotional connection to the characters and that made the climax difficult to feel anything more than indifference."}, {"userName": "Nikki Brooks", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27612853-nikki-brooks", "userReview": "Kyran has only just managed to escape from his own person hell, courtesy of the O\u2019Baoill\u2019s. BUt he is drawn to a ridge overlooking the home of Caitlin Brookes. He has no clue why but he feels the overwhelming need to be near her, protect her. Unbeknownst to him, Caitlin is way more than just a passing fancy, she is his mate! Caitlin has been through trauma of her own but she has reclaimed some independence after losing her sight. She has her own supernatural secrets and she totally flips Kyran mind when she calls him out on his...otherness! They both have a right to vengeance against the O\u2019Baoill\u2019s. Caitlin just has to get the idiot to realise that as a Banshee she is capable to defending herself, she is not quite as fragile as he'd like to think! There are little vignettes into the past tortures endured by Kyran and that really helps to cement the level of malevolence to which the O\u2019Baoill\u2019s have stooped. Caitlin is a real steel magnolia, all soft and fragile looking but with an inner core of steel! There is a lot to love about this book. The only reason it's not a 5 star review is that as an actual Scot, I hate characters within books mangling the dialect! It's really disjointing trying to work through the authors attempt to portray the admittedly guttural accent we have but sometimes it just comes across as comedy highlander sadly. But if you can ignore that then the pace, plot and characters themselves are wonderfully crafted."}, {"userName": "T.M.

Kyran retreated after the last battle and went to live out his long life in a cave while there however something pulled him to a little cabin. In that cabin lived a beautiful woman with her German Sheppard dog. He knew immediately when he was invited in to meet her finally that she was his sun. Kyran had been tortured by the hunters for so many years. Kyran is so much more than dragon. How could the fates show such mercy by gifting him this beautiful person? Caitlin is a very strong woman who lives with demons of her own. On top of that the one woman she thought she could trust well let's just say she will get what's coming to her. What Caitlin lacks in site her other senses are stronger than anything Kyran has ever known. Can these two total opposites have a lifetime together?Well grab your copy and get reading. I absolutely loved Kyran's book he became a favorite of mine a few books back in this series.

However, I shouldn't have worried. This is one of the reasons I love Julia Mills' books. I can read them out of order and won't feel like I'm lost and can't follow the storyline. Ugh! Can I just say that epilogue? Makes me have to go out and buy more books because I have to find out who's next!Kyran, a black dragon, is alive and breathing, but he's not really living. After surviving the tortures at the hands of hunters he's vowed he will get his revenge. But his dragon seems to be drawn to the raven haired beauty living alone in the cottage. He never expected to discover she'd be his other half.Caitlin has had a painful past too, by the same hunters who tortured Kyran. A mixed banshee and gypsy, she knows immediately about the black dragon spying on her. After the first meeting she knows immediately who he is to her. But will the demons of their past keep them from future with each other?"}, {"userName": "Brandy Mulder", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25687993-brandy-mulder", "userReview": "I have not read any of the other books in this series, so I was prepared for there to be things that were thought to be understood by the reader since it is pretty far in to the series. There were a couple of moments where I was like wow that happened quick but as the other dragons went with it I am guessing it is a normal part of the mating bond. I love that his lady is blind but far from helpless. She is just as fierce as he is, and just as dangerous in her own way. There is violence and adult content."}, {"userName": "Wendy Bianco", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18257112-wendy-bianco", "userReview": "Kyran is a rare and powerful Black dragon.

Made for a nice change of pace. Kyran as we know, has suffered a century of untold torment and torture at the hands of the O\u2019Baoills. His background story started at the end of Scars of her Dragon and we learnt a lot more as it was threaded through the last book Her Mad Dragon as well.Caitlin is visually impaired due to the actions of the same evil b**ch who tortured Kryan for over a century. Caitlin is part Gypsy and part Banshee like Kyran who is also half Banshee. Like calling to like.Finding out Kyran was being poisoned by Black Magic Caitlin uses a spell to remove the dark magic which is when they find out her nurse/carer is really working for the O\u2019Baoills.Kyran and Caitlin deal with the treacherous woman just before we have some of the Dragon Guards turn up that were tracking Kyran down. I was a bit upset Caitlin did not get all the trappings that go along with mating a Dragon Guard, the pomp and ceremony that is such a part of this series and hope Kyran keeps his word to have another ceremony at the Lair.This is where the extended version starts. Oh wow, once again Ms Mills brings us such a lot of action and suspense.Kyran being an idiot male, manages to hurt lovely Caitlin with his macho behaviour but Caitlin forgives him without the ass kicking he deserved. Our group manage to save more shifters being held by Evil Eve and deal with some dark unknown evil force Eve had imprisoned which is now on the loose.Eve gets her just rewards but does not go quietly stating there are other hunter squads around, she then throws a massive truth or lie at the Dragon Guards, only time will tell.I really felt for both Caitlin and Kryan for what they had been through and I am so glad they had a resolution against the evil to the core Eve O\u2019Baoill. There is a special place in hell for her and her family.These two were perfect for each other and the strength and support between them was wonderful to read about.This is my honest review of this book."}], "description": "Escaped from hell on earth, lost and alone, a wail in the night calls to not only his beast but also his heart.
