Colson writes in a free-flowing and easy to read fashion, mixing in a good variety of personal stories and experiences, historical stories and references, and modern day theories and realities regarding his topic(s) of choice. This takes the monotony out of what might otherwise could have been considered a \"boring\" topic. Colson's main emphasis, outlined from the very beginning, is that there are two \"kingdoms\" that exist: the kingdom of man, and the ultimate authority Kingdom of God. In order for an earthly society to exist and continue to exist, BOTH kingdoms must be present, Colson argues, and both must work TOGETHER, in tandem, towards accomplishing their explicit (Bible-mandated) priorities: the Kingdom of God - evangelizing and spreading the Gospel of Christ; the kingdom of man - maintaining law, order, and justice in society through the traditional structures of government and laws. Using this as his main thesis, Colson weaves in many other topics, including arguing AGAINST the often said theory that \"politics and religion should not mix.\" As Christians, we have a right, God-given responsibility, and solemn duty to participate in the political realm - whatever that might mean - working to ensure that the two kingdoms are given legitimacy and that the moral underpinnings of society are maintained. However, Colson lays out a strong argument that Christians should in no way act to undermine the government (the kingdom of man), imposing Christianity - or setting up a theocracy - on society. It is true that we need both kingdoms to exist and flourish in their God-given roles in order to maintain a healthy and balanced society."}, {"userName": "Elijah Abanto", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13291004-elijah-abanto", "userReview": "Despite of the use of Catholic examples to make his point (which we need to be careful of), Colson effectively writes a truly insider's view of the boundaries between faith and politics. The church is supposed to be the salt and light of this world and the proclaimer of the gospel and God's rule, while the state's is a God-ordained institution as the executor of justice and keeper of order in society. If the two will go beyond those boundaries, chaos happens. I've learned so much from this book that it's not enough to share those things in this review, but I tell you, you will not waste your time in reading this book."}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/351830-alexandra", "userReview": "What happens when the church becomes the state - as the Catholic church did? What happens when the state controls the church - as in Nazi Germany? And what is the proper balance between church and state?Interesting and provocative. Good read only for the explaination of the role, and failure, of the church in Nazi Germany, but there is much more here. Food for thought on the subject of how too much coziness between the church and state corrupts the church, and hinders it from doing what it is meant to do - stand seperate from earthy power and be independant voice, free from the corruption earthy power brings."}, {"userName": "Ruth Lemont", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44702743-ruth-lemont", "userReview": "Amazing book. Although written nearly 40 years ago, the principles and stories of this incredible work ring powerfully true today. A wonderful blend of storytelling, history, theology, and politics. There is an updated version, \"God and Government\" published in 2007 that I am hoping to get my hands on soon."}, {"userName": "Jesse Jost", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10954940-jesse-jost", "userReview": "Solid book issues related to the kingdom of God and our roles as citizens in both the kingdom of God and earthly governments."}, {"userName": "Ebookwormy1", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1005834-ebookwormy1", "userReview": "For our summer reading program, I wanted to read a Chuck Colson book. Spurred on by his passing this year, it seemed fitting to remember this man by reading the wisdom he had left behind.The Kingdoms in Conflict of the title are the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Man. This book starts with a (somewhat strange) fictional narrative of how the two kingdoms can come into conflict in our world. I didn't like the narrative and thought it was left hanging and unresolved as the book progressed.The book is an interesting blend of Colson's grandfatherly story telling and prescient principles that reads more like a discussion of ideas than the logical, sequential argumentation I was anticipating.There are many nuggets of wisdom here, but unfortunately, I read this at a time in my life when I wasn't able to mine them. Generally, Colson advocates the following:- Each Kingdom has a God ordained role. The Kingdom of God, to preach the gospel of Jesus and demonstrate the LORD's love and care. The Kingdom of Man, to maintain law and order and restrain evil.- When one kingdom imposes on the realm of the other, problems develop. The Kingdom of God has no place to enforce belief or morality upon others.- The Kingdom of Man has mo place to claim worship or religious status that belongs only to God.- When the Kingdom of God becomes absorbed or manipulated into the Kingdom of Man, it loses its ability to call the Kingdom to account.- When the Kingdom of Man usurps demands worship, the Kingdom of God has a place to exercise civil disobedience. But, civil disobedience has limits (though I was disappointed at having a clear statement of those limits).A good read that I probably picked up at the wrong time. Recommended, but it didn't make an indelible impression."}, {"userName": "Michelle Marshall", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/567019-michelle-marshall", "userReview": "Really meaty book that took me more than 4 months to get through, but interesting insights nonetheless about the balance and different responsibilities of the church and the state. At times it was a little wordy and bordered on being an advertisement for Chuck Colson's prison ministry (which I admire, don't get me wrong, but...), but on the whole, I really learned a lot and felt that he had some very wise and concrete examples to back up his opinion. I felt he was very fair and balanced, while maintaining his own views as a Republican."}, {"userName": "J.

Taking position that not all conservatives will appreciate, Colson brings balance to the separation of church and state argument, showing that the church needs the government, and that the government needs the church. There are some sections of the book that go on a little long, but the writing is compelling throughout."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12410120-ryan", "userReview": "I wish Christians would read this and believe it. He delivers the perfect balance of being involved in politics (as a means of loving your neighbor) but not looking to the government to be the church. Church was a smart man and a godly one as well.

Twenty years ago, the first edition of Chuck Colson's Kingdoms in Conflict became a bestseller, a must-read for people interested in politics and the relationship between church and state. Now, with a passion for truth and moved by the urgency of the times we live in, Colson has written God and Government, re-voicing his powerful and enduring message for our post-9/11 world.In an era when Christianity is being attacked from every side\u2014books being written charging Christians with being theocrats and trying to impose their views on an unwilling culture\u2014what is the message of the Christian church? What does the Bible say, and what do we learn from history about the proper relationship between faith and culture? Appealing to scripture, reason, and history, this book tackles society's most pressing and divisive issues. New stories and examples reflect the realities of today, from the clash with radical Islam to the deep division between 'reds' and 'blues.' In an era of angry finger-pointing, Colson furnishes a unique insider's perspective that can't be pigeonholed as either 'religious right' or 'religious left.' Whatever your political or religious stance, this book will give you a different understanding of Christianity. If you're a Christian, it will help you to both examine and defend your faith. If you've been critical of the new religious right, you'll be shocked at what you learn. Probing both secular and religious values, God and Government critiques each fairly, sides with neither, and offers a hopeful, fair-minded perspective that is sorely needed in today's hyper-charged atmosphere.", "title": "Kingdoms in Conflict", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/279409.Kingdoms_in_Conflict", "average": 4.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349445788l/279409.jpg", "reviews": 23, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/27694.Charles_W_Colson", "name": "Charles W.
