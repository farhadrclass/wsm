She always blows me away with the uniqueness of her stories and the beautiful way they\u2019re written. All of them have a special place in my heart in a different way, yet none of them have touched me quite like From Sand and Ash did. This is by far her best work yet. This book is unforgettable. Truly one of the most stunning, beautiful, powerful and heart wrenching books I have ever read. I don\u2019t normally read historical books. They don\u2019t always hold my interest, but I\u2019m going to tell you right now- I don\u2019t care if you read historical, romance, fiction, non-fiction, whatever- this is a book that needs to be read by everyone. The majority of this story spans from the late 1930\u2019s to the early/mid 1940\u2019s and takes place in Italy. Eva Rosselli is an Italian Jew and Angelo Bianco is a Catholic. Eva and Angelo grow up together, and despite their differences, they find themselves falling in love. Even though Angelo has these feelings for Eva, he follows his calling into the priesthood. So now we have a Jewish girl and and Catholic Priest. Years after this happens, the lives of these two people change forever. \n\nHow can you compromise with people who don\u2019t want you to exist? They want us to disappear. I can\u2019t adapt to death. \n Oh the feels. The fact that this book is based on real life just makes my heart hurt even more. It\u2019s hard to imagine things like this really happened. I know it\u2019s history, but it\u2019s not like this was hundreds of years ago. For all of you that like to feel, know there are good feels and feels that are not so good. I found myself crying more often than my eyes were dry. This is a story of life and death. Of love and of survival. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s war, and I will do my part. I will not sit by why others die. If I can help, I will.\u201d\n\nEva is one of the most strong and fearless heroines I have ever read about. She was incredibly brave and selfless. Was she ever scared of what was going on in her life? Of course. But that is the true definition of fearlessness. Being afraid, but not letting it hold you back. Angelo was amazing in his own right. The things he did and the sacrifices he made. They were both amazing human beings. No matter how hard things got, they were both able to keep their faith strong, which I\u2019m sure seemed impossible at the time. \n\n\u201cThe more I see, the harder it is to believe in God\u2026 Some days it hurts too much to believe.\u201d \u201cIt hurts more not to believe. I am starting to think God is the only reason any of us is alive.\u201d \n\n \nThis is a story that will change you. Your life will be changed by reading this book. It will move you and make you think and feel and completely captivate you. I can\u2019t imagine one person reading this book and not being changed for the better once they\u2019re done. It has romance in it, and that romance is beautiful, but there is so much more to the story than that. From Sand and Ash is a painful read. It shows the horror and terrible things that happened during the WWII time period. It\u2019s also a beautiful story full of love, faith and devotion. This book may be historical, but I think it is still relevant for us today. It\u2019s one of the very best books I\u2019ve read this year, and I have a feeling it will be one of the most memorable books of my lifetime. This is an unforgettable story and one I recommend every person read."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.comBeautiful, heartbreaking and inspirational. Loved it! Amy Harmon is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. Each of her books that I've read has been incredibly emotional and touching.'From Sand and Ash' is a gripping account of true love in WWII-era Italy. This story held my attention from start to finish. I fell in love with the characters and the visually rich setting. This book was so beautifully crafted that the scenes were nearly tangible.At the same time, the beauty was in stark contrast to the brutality of the Nazi regime. Although I knew at the onset where the story would lead, it was easy to see how the brutality of the time snuck up on the complacent and disillusioned Italian people. I could relate to the responses from many of the characters that refused to acknowledge the danger until it was too late. The shift was gradual and insidious.This is undoubtedly one of the most compelling romances that I've read this year. The love between Eva and Angelo was unbelievable. They had the type of love that is incredibly intimate and real. They weren't perfect, but they loved each other in spite of their imperfections. If you love a forbidden love story, this is your book. Never has there been a couple with the odds stacked against them more than these two. They fought for each other and their love, refusing to give up no matter how hopeless their situation might have seemed.This story was inspirational and heartfelt. I was deeply moved by Eva and Angelo's story. Not only was this book highly entertaining, but it was the type of book that leaves a lasting impression. I will not be forgetting these characters and their plight anytime soon. I can only hope that it will be made into a movie at some point. If you're looking for a suspenseful, heartfelt story, this is a great choice. This is the type of book that feeds the soul. It is beautiful and inspiring. This is a new favorite of mine and one of my top reads for the year."}, {"userName": "Amy Harmon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9005639-amy-harmon", "userReview": "AVAILABLE ON AMAZON: E-BOOK | PAPERBACK | AUDIO\n\"Fear is strange.It settles on chests and seeps through skin, through layers of tissue, muscle, and bone and collects in a soul-sized black hole, sucking the joy out of life, the pleasure, the beauty.But not the hope.Somehow, the hope is the only thing resistant to the fear, and it is that hope that makes the next breath possible, the next step, the next tiny act of rebellion, even if that rebellion is simply staying alive.\"\n\n\"There was no one left to save.He didn\u2019t even know if he had the strength to save himself.

With every song and with every prayer, with every small rebellion\u2026\u201d\nBefore I begin gushing over this story I must start with a line from the author\u2019s note\u2026\n\u201dI did my best to represent the Jewish and Catholic religions and people with love and respect.\u201d\nAmy Harmon beautifully represented these two faiths during this World War II based romance. The extent of her research, and the unique way she incorporated real people and events into this fictional love story was spectacular. The time and love that the author put into this fictional hero and heroine though surprisingly other characters in the story were very much real. The story spans the life of Batsheva \u201cEva\u201d Rosselli a Jewish violinist and Angelo Bianco a catholic priest. The love and family they share and the struggle to protect themselves in Italy as Hitler\u2019s army persecutes is gut wrenching. \n\u201dI never really thought about being Jewish until I started to be persecuted for it.\"\nThe friendship between Eva and Angelo blossoms into love though Angelo has other plans for his life. Though Angelo chooses another path for himself he uses it to help thousands and most especially his Eva.\n\u201dI would do anything for you, Eva. Anything.\u201d He thought of what Camillo had said about not only blessing lives, but saving Jewish lives, and it gave him the strength to continue. \u201cBut I can\u2019t have you and the church. I need the church, Eva. I need the church, and I believe the church needs me.\u201d\nThe story spans years as the Germans take over Italy and the Jewish families struggle to survive the horror and indignities. Angelo's love for Eva and need to protect her far surpassed this war, the multitude of losses, and yes even their faiths.\n\u201dIt was love that made each touch feel like redemption and each kiss like rebirth. Not just lust. Not just pleasure. It was love that created joy.\u201d\nThis story was well written, heartbreaking, beautiful, and unforgettable. Even if you are not a big historic fan this is definitely worth the read and I highly recommend meeting Eva and Angelo. **ARC provided in exchange for an honest review**"}, {"userName": "\u2665 Jx PinkLady Reviews \u2665 ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16496589-jx-pinklady-reviews", "userReview": "*LIVE! #6StarsFrom Sand and Ash is shrouded in historical events that are deplorable. Evil at its worse without the need to exaggerate in any way. Set in Italy during the German occupation of 1943 and onwards, it shows the danger and evil faced by Jewish people at the hands of the Gestapo, the horror of war, dictatorship and the atrocities of the past juxtaposed with the awe-inspiring human capacity of survival; to hope, to love, to have faith, to overcome the worse kind of evil. The story is achingly beautiful, poignant and so very moving ensuring Eva Rosselli and Angelo Bianco, the engaging protagonists of this eloquently written and powerful historical romance, will be in my mind and heart for some time to come. As the story unfolds we experience their trials, the horrors, conflict of emotion and joy as the many elements of this story are weaved fluently into the vivid third person narrative. How they meet as children, grow up together as close as family developing a very special bond. I felt their connection but as the years pass another path naturally calls to Angelo which provides the most deeply emotive and beautiful aspect to the plot, it left me yearning and wondering how their lives would play out. We learn in the acknowledgements that the historical events shaping From Sand and Ash are all based on real life occurrences of that period in time, which adds an intelligent and thought provoking dose of gravitas to this heartfelt fictional story and illustrates the care and attention to detail used by the author when crafting her story arc. As I read I wondered how I would be able to find the adjectives to adequately convey the quality and the depth of this story. It whisked me away to Italy, charmed me, made me love the characters, each and every one on the side of good showing the courage of their convictions. I admired their bravery and basked in the vivid nature of the writing. Amy Harmon's words hooked me into a narrative that, at times, left me breathless with the expanse of emotion evoked and completely invested in the romance element delicately weaved through the layers of the perfectly executed prose to the point that I was mesmerised by the happenings and on the edge of my seat for the conclusion of their story. The genre is historical romance and I highly recommend to all those who seek beautifully crafted stories that accurately transport the reader to another place in time with characters who inspire and a love that takes one\u2019s breath away. #historical #WorldWarTwo#romance#loveI read as a KINDLE FIRST title from Amazon.co.uk \u2605 Graphics created by me with stock photos I purchased from deposit photos \u2605"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "From Sand and Ash by Amy Harmon is a 2016 Lake Union publication.Gritty, heart wrenching, tragic, but so very beautiful and passionate-I\u2019ve been meaning to read this book for several years- yes- years. It\u2019s been languishing on my Kindle as first one obstacle, then another got in the way of my reading it. I knew it was a book I\u2019d want to digest slowly and take my time with, so despite the delay, I think this was the best time to absorb such a rich, engrossing tale. \u201cMy father told me once that we are on earth to learn. God wants us to receive everything that life was meant to teach Then we take what we\u2019ve learned, and it becomes our offering to God, and to mankind. But, we have to live in order to learn. And sometimes we have to fight in order to live.\"Angelo is sent from the United States to Italy, where he is taken in by the Rosselli family. He and Eva grew up together like siblings, but Eva has known in her heart, right from the start that her love for Angelo goes much deeper, is much stronger. However, Angelo has been prepped and pressured from a young age to enter the priesthood, which means a romantic relationship with Eva is off the table, even though his feelings match hers. But, with the outbreak of World War Two, when fascism take hold and then reigns, as Jews, Eva and her family become targets and are placed in extreme danger. Angelo makes it is life\u2019s mission to keep Eva alive, despite the danger and obvious risks.\u201cThey can take our homes, our possessions. Our families. Our lives.\u2026 They can humiliate us and dehumanize us. But they cannot take our thoughts. They cannot take our talents. They cannot take our knowledge, or our memories, or our minds.\u201dBut, Eva refuses to allow herself to be hidden away, allowing Angelo to bear the brunt of everything, while her family and so many others are being persecuted. Together, they face obstacles and endure heartbreak, amid the joy of ecstasy, with the power of their faith and love as the driving force that gives them the strength, the will, and the hope to make it out alive. \u201cLife is a long note; it persists without variance, without wavering. There is no cessation in sound or pause in tempo. It continues on, and we must master it, or it will master us.\u201dThis story took my breath away. So much death, heartbreak, and grief, danger, intrigue and suspense, so many moral dilemmas and personal crisis of faith, so much sacrifice, so much yearning. This story was painful to read in many ways, very intense and at times emotionally draining. But, there is nothing, but nothing, better than an epic love story- nothing makes my heart swell quite like 'love conquering all', and in the end, it certainly did do that, propelled, no doubt, by hope. (No naysayers- please! Never underestimate the power of love, faith, hope, forgiveness and redemption!!)This author did an incredible amount of research, from the dialogue, the historical details, all while creating a taut atmosphere, right along with all the gut punching emotions, making the reader feel as though they are living events right along side Eva and Angelo. In my mind this is one of those books that everyone should read. I learned a lot of historical detail I was unaware of, and are topics I rarely hear discussed about the second world war. But, it is also a book that examines the human spirit in the face of unfathomable adversity. It\u2019s about keeping your own value system while acknowledging and accepting someone else\u2019s beliefs, loving them for who and what they are, unconditionally. I can\u2019t say enough about this story. It is everything I had been told it was and much more besides!! This story reminds me and should be a reminder to all \u2013 while believing in hope may seem false and futile- never give up, never stop fighting, because there really is and always will be- hope!!

I know it's only February, but I'm going to go ahead and say this is my favourite book of 2017 - it will be next to impossible to top. Historical fiction is my most favourite genre and this book was one of the absolute best historical fiction novels I have ever read! I took my time with this book, saving it for when I had longer chunks of uninterrupted time to read and truly savour the writing and story. This is my first Amy Harmon book - I have found a new favourite author - I feel I'm \"in awe\" of Harmon - I will read anything she writes!I'm spent - emotionally exhausted after experiencing the love, war, hope and pain throughout this novel. I FELL ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with both of the main characters - Eva and Angelo. Their love story is one that I will NEVER forget. The wartime atrocities that happen throughout this book are horrendous and based on true events. As hard as it was to read at times, Harmon explains in her Author's Note \"My prayer is that people of today will know the past so they won't repeat it.\" Very well said!A few quotes that deeply affected me were: \"When children suffer, the ones who love them suffer even more, helpless to alleviate their agony.\"When Angelo was explaining to Eva the beauty he remembers in his deceased mother. \"To me she was (beautiful). And she was soft. ..... Everything about her comforted me. She was...soft. .... Mamma was love. And she didn't even have to try. She just...was.\" Melt my heart!!!!Another heart melting quote was when Nonna found twelve year old Eva and fourteen year old Angelo kissing. \"She shrieked their names and swatted them both on the heads, crossing herself and praying between the slaps. They were grounded from each other for two days...\"I could go on and on about all of the things I adored about this story, but I would rather you pick up the book to experience it yourself. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to anyone who loves, likes or just wants to try out historical fiction. You'll be forever changed after reading this beautiful story.

I've been to Israel and I've sat in front of a Holocaust survivor who told her story and I cried, along with so many others in the audience. It's mind boggling and ugly. But this book was able to show that among that ugliness there were people who had HOPE and love for other people -people who they didn't know yet risked their own lives to save. I'll leave you with a video of a man who saved hundreds of children from death in concentration camps. I embedded it on my blog HERE.P.S. Amy Harmon's writing is, as usual, spectacular and hypnotizing. My only complaint is with the narration of the audiobook. I understood that everyone was speaking with an Italian accent to make it seem more authentic but I just found it distracting. I wouldn't probably hear an accent in my head while reading the book so I don't think it was necessary.

BY FAR, WITHOUT DOUBT!Beautiful, heart-wrenching, exquisite and incredibly powerful, From Sand and Ash is the best work this author has created.Amy Harmon is unforgiving as she retells history. She doesn't sugar coat it for her readers, she doesn't hide the pain, tragedy, and atrocities. She immerses the reader in the pain and horror and the despair of her characters.From the start, I was riveted. The prologue set the book up exquisitely and perfectly letting us know this was not going to be an easy read.Angelo has been sent to live with his grandparents in Italy after his mother died. Due to his physical disability, his father commanded Angelo to move to Italy and become a priest.Eva was charming, vicarious and full of energy. She was loyal and smart and a gifted violinist.Having known each other nearly their entire lives, Eva and Angelo have been raised together in the same house, even though they were not related. His Italian grandparents were the household staff of her Jewish family. What started as a friendship quickly turns to love, but Angelo is destined to be a priest, and Eva is a jew.\n\n\u275d I love you. I have always loved you, and I will always love you.\u275e\n\nHitler is in power and has invaded Italy. Slowly, and methodically his troops are forcing their way through the streets, alleyways and into the villages and homes of the Jewish-Italian people. Ripping away their families, their freedom, their lives.\n\n\u275dWill there ever be a time when people aren't afraid? \u275e\n\nFrom Sand and Ash is realistic fiction. The story not only happened, it is happening today. Hitler is no longer in power and trying to rid the world of Jews, but there are others in power attempting to wipe out entire races and religions. Syria comes to mind. The significance of this book in our world, in our time, is not only powerful but important.\n\n\u275d I wonder sometimes what would happen if everyone without a choice had made a choice anyway. If we all chose not to participate. Not to be bullied. Not to take up arms. Not to persecute. What would happen then?\u275e\n\nHarmon gives us a story about family, perseverance, love, loyalty, right and wrong, and selfless devotion.I am humbled with gratitude to have received an ARC. Because this was the most beautiful, poignant and significant book, I have ever read! EVER. If there is one book, JUST ONE book that I could choose to read for the rest of my life, it would be THIS BOOK!\n\n\u275d They cannot take our thoughts. They cannot take our talents.

Based on the fact that this book takes place in occupied Italy during WW2, I knew that it would be painfully hard to read at points, if not throughout the entirety. The harsh realities of the lives of the people in Italy during this time were staggering. The horrors of the Holocaust are widespread and far reaching to this very day. We hear about what the Jewish people were forced to endure and it makes us shudder just to even imagine their overwhelming suffering. But what about the indoctrination period? Do you ever sit and wonder how evil of this magnitude could trickle into everyday life? Until it's no longer a trickle, it's a flood of hate and torment that drowns everyone in its path? Her hands shook and her stomach revolted, and every horrified breath felt like fire in her throat. Yet still she sat, composed, her terror held inside the bony cage that sheltered her war-torn heart and her shrapnel-riddled lungs.This book shines a light on how something so inconceivable to us became the mundane. Fear and uncertainty ruled every day. Things would get better if they just kept quiet and kept their heads down, if they waited it out. The characters were fictional, but the emotions, the events were chillingly real. Harmon's detail in depicting the setting, and the delicacy of their attraction growing amid the horrors that surrounded them is a startling contrast. Perhaps making the purity of their devotion to one another even more powerful. It was love that made each touch feel like redemption and each kiss feel like rebirth. Not lust. Not pleasure. It was love that created joy.Angelo and Eva had the type of relationship that many would condemn. Growing up, being raised together like brother and sister, and of such differing religious faiths made them the consummate forbidden pair. But the strength of their connection to one another was absolute. It defied years of separation, denial, and discouragement. It defied war and humiliation and despair. Their abiding love to one another could never be extinguished or tempered no matter what battered at them. Their struggle, it moved me to tears many times. It was honest, and achingly unyielding. He didn\u2019t know how to heal her or hold her or save her. He didn\u2019t know how to be what she needed. All he knew was that he loved her desperately. Desperately.For some, this story would be too harsh to experience. Knowing the trials that face these characters are all too uncomfortable for its truth. But for me, a story like this is necessary. It serves to remind us of the horrible path this world has taken, one that must never, ever be forgotten. But it also shows how just a glimmer of hope can have miraculous results even in our darkest hours. It reveals to readers with profound and sensitive skill that sometimes, love can conquer all. Angelo and Eva were beautiful souls struggling to make sense of their feelings, their faith, and survival by any means possible. This is one of those books that is so insightful and exquisite, I feel like I'm better for having read it. I read this in one day, cover to cover, feeling desperate for the world to right itself again. I wasn't an impartial observer, I was right in the middle of their battle. I stayed up until 3 AM in order to find peace, I never could have settled without knowing the final fate of these characters. It was just that intense. Amy Harmon has done it again, she has proved herself to be the kind of writer who can write in any genre, on any topic and make me grateful that I was lucky enough to have experienced her gift of words.

What kind of priest can I be if I don\u2019t believe in God anymore?\u201d he confessed, his voice thick. \u201cSome days it hurts too much to believe.\u201d\nWhat I love the most about war stories be it fact or fiction is the human factor. When people are forced into a corner they will either rise up as a villain or a hero. But even then, things are not necessarily black and white. And that's what this book is about. Also, this is a personal preference, but I want to see more of the ugly side of war.\n Loving someone and then losing them would be much worse than not having them at all.\nEven though this book is not fully a romance, I could feel the love they had for each other. And how it both hurt and healed them.From Sand and Ash is a beautifully written poignant story of a couple's journey trying to survive a war that divided them. It would appeal to readers looking for a love story that also celebrates the strength of human hearts.\u269c \u2720 \u269c . . .

From Sand and Ash\u00a0is a stunning masterpiece that left me breathless with its exquisite prose, the phenomenally framed characters, vulnerable and strong at the same time, and the richness of a storyline perfectly crafted. The author did a splendid job mixing a good amount of history\u00a0with its sheer depths of horror and depravity that could be reached by civilized humans, with the beautiful forbidden love story between Eva Rosselli an Italian Jew and Angelo Bianco, a Catholic priest. I feel no amount of praise will ever do a book of this caliber justice and there really is no way to properly express how incredible Eva and Angelo's story is. I feel at loss of words to convey my feelings...this is just a book I wish I could make everyone read. Because books like these are few and far between, and are nothing less than life-changing.

You know when you pick up a book and after you read a few pages you can tell that it's going to be an epic read?! That was this book for me. When asked by friends and family what this book is about I tell them it's a mix of Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and The Bronze Horseman. From Sand and Ash encompasses the struggle of the Jewish people and the Catholic church during WWII in Europe. \n\u201cHow can you compromise with people who don't want you to exist? They want us to disappear. I can't adapt to death.\u201d \nFrom Sand and Ash is an excellent reminder to not try to eliminate people and cultures that are different than what we are. We can't allow history repeat itself. Okay, sorry, I got off track a little .... enough said on that matter.I loved both the main characters so much. Ms. Harmon has a way with creating the most memorable characters. The Jewish woman and the Catholic Priest were done magnificently. Each had their own set of flaws that made me endear them more. The struggle between survival and love was something I felt deeply while reading this book. I read 3/4 in paperback format and listened to the last forth via audio. Once the audio was released I bought it because I want my husband to \"read\" this book too. I loved both reading it and listening to it.

However, Amy Harmon manages to incorporate so much beauty in this very dark time. From Sand and Ash is full of contrasts: life/death, hope/defeat, courage/fear, compliance/rebellion, faith/doubt, love/rejection, desire/restraint... the list goes on. But such is this magical life \u2013 we cannot survive the depths without having at least a flicker of light, and even more so when the world is at war and a beautiful people are being destroyed simply because they exist.Amy Harmon has created incredibly human characters full of complexities. She has also replicated the palpable emotions that coincide with tragic times, but the themes of family, love, and resiliency shine through. For me, this was an incredibly rich reading experience that gave me hope. Hope that with every negative, a positive can be found and with every person full of evil intent, there will be another who will choose to do the right thing.

Of course I know things that have happened, but I don't read about it nor watch many older shows about it. I don't read historic romances, I haven't had much luck when I have. Times have changed. This book rocked my world. Maybe I'm older now, maybe it's because I have kids now, maybe it's simply because sadly I see and hear so much of the hate that goes on in this world and it saddens my heart. I got to meet Angelo Bianco and I instantly loved him. He was basically passed off to his grandparents in a foreign country at a young age. He had so much to overcome and my heart was heavy with all he had to deal with. Then throw in a horrible war and his priorities were all out of whack. He chose to follow his lord and dedicated himself to Jesus. \nEva Rosselli grew up in Italy. Her childhood wasn't ideal, losing her Jewish mother at a young age. she was raised with loving grandparents, a loving father, and many loving family members. The love she didn't get was from the one she wanted the most. From Angelo. She would do just about anything to love him, it just wasn't enough. \nI loved her strength. I loved her passion for her violin. I loved her compassion for everyone around her. She was simply amazing. \nI loved that she got to the point where she accepted that she could never have Angelo and she would never come first to him. \nThe ugliness of war is horrid to live, to see, to read, to hear. There is no easy about any of it. It was hard to read. It was sickening to know that this really happened. Not everyone gets a happily ever after. Not everyone lives to see the end of the war.

This was the first book that I have read that shows the incredible measures the Catholic Church took to hide and evacuate the Jewish people during Hitler's reign. Amy Harmon's well written fictional story, that incorporates historical truth, shows how people of all religions can come together with compassion for each other no matter what their beliefs are. Reading stories such as this helps me to restore my belief in humanity, especially now when at times the respect and love that we should be showing each other seems to be lacking. I have not read a lot of historical romance novels before, but Harmon did a wonderful job interweaving both the historical and romance aspects of this story.

Definitely Amy Harmon\u2019s finest work and I have enjoyed all of her books thus far. There were so many things I loved about this book but writing stands out the most. Amy Harmon\u2019s storytelling was so intense, visceral and poignant. This story was set in Italy starting before the German invasion and lasted for the Nazi occupation of the Italy. It was such a dark and depressing historical period, but the author managed weave a tale of love, hope, faith and loyalty. Eva Rosselli and Angelo Bianco were childhood best friends despite being her being Jewish and him being Catholic. Despite their affection for each other, Angelo decided that he could best serve God as a priest. \n\u201cGod makes me strong. He gives me courage. He gives me peace. He gives me purpose.\u201d\n As Angelo joined the priesthood, Eva began navigating life in Italy where Jews were stripped of every conceivable right of citizenship despite the Jews \u201cmaking up 1% of the countries population\u201d. At her darkest hour, Angelo took in Eva and some other family friends to hid them, but it endangered all the priests around.Angelo was forced to consider what his life would be like if the Nazi\u2019s were to find Eva and the other Jews that the priests were protecting. While Eva struggles to survive, she was also forced to deal with the fact that the man she loved chose to be a priest over a life with her.This story was both inspiring, enlightening and emotionally POWERFUL. Every time I felt despondent, a gestured or an event occurred that contributed some reason for hope and encouragement. \n\u201cHope is the only thing resistant to the fear, and it is the hope that makes the next breath possible, the next step, the next tiny act of rebellion, even if that rebellion is simply staying alive.\u201d\nThe author didn\u2019t mislead the readers by painting a rosy picture of war times. But those tendrils of devotion and faithfulness kept me optimistic as I listened to tale. The narrator Cassandra Campbell was excellent in her various accented voices. She was a great choice for this book.I loved both Eva and Angelo for different reasons. Both were strong characters, loving, honest and altruistic. Eva though just stole my heart. She had a clarity about almost everything. She was decisive and even stubborn. Angelo was so endearing because he truly tried to honor his faith even if he had to sacrifice his own heart. I admired his commitment and his perseverance. The author did an amazing job developing these characters as well as the overall plot. I never felt that the author sacrificed the historical plight of the people in favor of a love story. It made everything feel so much more authentic and genuine. I am always amazed at the blessings that occurred despite immense suffering during the tragedies of war. This story was one of the best written historical fiction novels I have ever read.

Just a few years younger than him, the two of them are raised together but as they grow older, they also start developing feelings for each other. Despite his feelings for Eva though, Angelo becomes a Catholic priest. When Hitler\u00b4s forces advance into Italy, he promises to help Eva (who is of Jewish descent) in any way he can. Its a promise that is going to test him in more ways than one.Wow, this was an intense and gripping narrative. I read a lot of historical fiction, particularly that pertaining to WWII and the Holocaust. It never ceases to amaze me how there is always something new to learn. The atrocities committed by the Nazis are of such a horrific nature that there will never be a time where it will be forgotten (as it should be). Part love story and part historical re-telling, this was an engaging read. Eva and Angelo meet as kids and though, they are not related they are raised as family. She is Jewish and he is Catholic (sent to Italy with the specific purpose of becoming a priest). To say their relationship is complicated is putting it mildly. Yet, its that force that propels him to try and save her. Being a priest allows Angelo to help in ways that would otherwise not be possible. Not just Eva but others fleeing persecution from the Nazis. All in all, I was amazed by this novel.There is an array of characters in this novel, some based on real people. One of these is the Irish Priest Monsignor Hugh O\u00b4Flaherty. The actual Monsignor O\u00b4Flaherty put together a network in the Vatican and recruited others to help. In total, this network saved 6,500 individuals during WWII. As it turns out, the Catholic church played an important role during the war through their intricate network. Its estimated that up to a total of 860,000 individuals (not just those of Jewish descent) were hidden and thus, saved during this deplorable period. Monasteries and convents were \"opening their doors and closing their eyes to the danger all around them.\" Many were hidden among the clergy, a great risk to take. The sacrifice and courage of these individuals should be applauded despite our personal beliefs.

I live in Europe so the WW2 was a very important part in our history classes, so I knew quite a lot of what happened during that time.

I cried a lot while I was reading this book, I just couldn't contain my tears, it was so horrific what the Jewish people went through. Both Angela and Eva were amazing characters that were so beautiful together. They were both such strong and phenomenal characters that put others before themselves. So selfless, and people like them helped so many people during the war. They go through so much in this book, but they never gave up hope. Hope is what keeps people going during these dark times.
