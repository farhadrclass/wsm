You're about to become absurdly famous. People are going to be badgering you to be on their talk shows. Saturday Night Live will do a spoof on you. David Letterman will come out of retirement just to do a top ten list with you on it. There will be fan fiction. So much fan fiction. Everyone is going to know who you are. You're going to have some clout. Power to get things done. Or to stop things from happening as the case may be. So with that in mind...Please, for the love of god do not let Nicholas Cage star in the film adaptation of this book. I am begging you. Use whatever power you have at your disposal, call in whatever favors you can but do this for me, for the thousands, nay the MILLIONS of other people who are about to fall in love with Nolan Moore and his intrepid team of wannabe Youtubers. For everyone who is about to descend into the depths of the Grand Canyon on an epic, amazing, spine tingling, quest as entertaining as \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and as thought provoking as...I don't know...something really thought provoking. For everyone who ever wanted to find a lost city or uncover a forgotten mystery that was never meant to be solved. For everyone who ever fell in love and then fell out and then fell back in and made a mess of it all over again and only figured it all out when it was too damn late. For every fan of the lovable rogue who likes to think he's a cynical old bastard but is secretly a hero to everyone around him. For all of those millions of people who are about to fall in love with you. Just see if Colin Farrell is interested! He'd be great! Or Gary Oldman! He's soooo hot right now and I know he's older but c'mon he'd be perfect! I would seriously even take Cumberbatch even though he's so overexposed at this point and I'm sure he's busy with all that Dr. Strange stuff. Or Sean Bean! He'd be terrific! But for the sake of us all. Say no to Nicholas Cage."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "Good Lord this was brilliant.

You\u2019ve got your British domestic suspense \u00e0 la The Child, your blue-collar detective novels like Two Girls Down, psychological mindwreckery like \nBehind Her Eyes\n \u2026 I could go on and on. Is it a stretch to posit that if you grouped and mapped thrillers as Darwin once mapped earth\u2019s species on a \u201ctree of life,\u201d you\u2019d find an array of fiction as copious as the animal kingdom itself? I think not :)This month, BOTM is proud to feature a book unlike anything we\u2019ve ever offered: a paranormal thriller that takes place in the pitch-black depths of the Grand Canyon. When a ragtag group of YouTube-famous archaeologists goes searching for a hidden cavern they assume is mere myth, they don\u2019t expect to stumble upon the greatest revelation to ever surface about mankind. But not all of the team is working together to connect an eon\u2019s worth of biological dots. Truths emerge, fingers are pointed, and ancient secrets are discovered \u2026 secrets, it seems, that not everyone wants found out.In my humble opinion, we\u2019ve offered a few good thrillers this year, but this one\u2014which is rich in both evolutionary freakiness and eerie conspiracy theories\u2014takes the cake. If you\u2019re looking for smoking guns, a handful of F-bombs, and Jurassic Park-esque chase scenes, look no further than this fast-paced adventure with serious Lara Croft vibes.Read more at: https://www.bookofthemonth.com/the-an..."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "Sometimes my son watches a TV programme where a group of, very strange, men, wander the backwoods of America looking for, and yet, never finding, strange creatures. This novel is cleverly based around a similar show \u2013 The Anomaly Files \u2013 a low budget, online show, with a similar theme of exploring conspiracy theories and, false history stories. The narrator of this novel, Nolan Moore, is the presenter, and he and the producer/director, Ken, have a new sponsor and the chance of a jump to cable TV. As such, it is essential that they make their new episode a success and take their one shot at cable and away from webcasts. The story that this episode is planned around, focuses on the story of an 1909 expedition, prospecting for minerals in the Grand Canyon. What did the hunter and explorer, G.E. Kincaid find in a cave, which was said to house great wonders, but also something very dangerous? Hopi legends suggest the cave was home to Maasaw, the \u2018keeper of death,\u2019 and Nolan, Ken, and the crew, plan to film a show about their attempts to locate the cavern. Actually, though, they never really anticipate that they will find anything, which makes it even more unbelievable, when it appears that they might actually have discovered more than they bargained for\u2026What made this book work for me was the characters. I loved the way that Nolan, recently separated and a little vulnerable, is always on the defensive about his job, but clearly has a real interest in the show he is making. The other characters help flesh out the plot and there are a good number of interesting female, and male, characters. Where the novel falls apart a little for me was near the end, as the plot is a little bizarre, to say the least. However, great fun and very well written. I would certainly read more by this author, who is very talented, and this certainly has a fabulous first half, even if it didn\u2019t quite live up to its promise."}, {"userName": "Benjamin Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4209082-benjamin-thomas", "userReview": "Nolan Moore leads a team of four TV web series production crew members in an effort to retrace the path of an explorer from 1909 who made an important but mysterious discovery of a cave high up in the rock strata of the Grand Canyon. Nolan\u2019s crew hopes to ramp up their reputation of chasing after strange conspiracy theory anomalies and turn this potential find into ratings gold and hopefully an actual TV network program. Thus, they allow a journalist and a rep for their corporate sponsor along for the journey making for a complete party of six.When, against all odds, they actually find the rumored cave and manage to climb to its entrance (filming their documentary along the way) it remains only to discover what, exactly, lies deep within. Could there be ancient bones from human tribes that heretofore were not known to exist in North America? Could there be some sort of long lost knowledge or treasure? Could there even be evidence of alien technology? Rumors have run the gamut for years, but this production crew was about to find out\u2026and capture it on film.I won\u2019t spoil anything but most of this thriller novel is devoted to what they find and how they deal with it. In essence it becomes a story of survival. The author, Michael Rutger is actually the pen name for Michael Marshall Smith (Michael Marshall), novelist, short story writer and screen writer. I didn\u2019t know this while reading the book but about half way through I remember thinking that reading this book was like watching an action-packed blockbuster movie. He certainly subscribes to the ol\u2019 author\u2019s tactic of putting their characters in jeopardy time and again, and just when they\u2019ve had all they can take\u2026make things really go bad.It was awesome!Now, I\u2019ve read a few thousand books before this one, and many in this sort of genre, and so I feel like I\u2019ve been through just about everything conceivable as far as what could possibly be waiting for this group of characters in that damn cave. But this was unique. And that was just one of several twists and surprises that awaited me. The whole plot is very well thought out and the writing is superb. Since the story is told via Nolan\u2019s first person POV, it all unfolds on a deeply personal level. Above all, I thought the pacing was spot on. For a novel like this, pacing is crucial. That\u2019s not something that is easily done, and even veteran authors sometimes fumble in this regard. There is a lot of humor throughout the book as characters interact with one another, much of it as a way to deal with what transpires. There are also some really scary scenes and one in particular that will be nesting in the back of my mind for many days to come.Even though this novel won't be published until June 2018, rumor has it that a major production company has already preemptively acquired the film rights, with at least one major director potentially attached. That happens sometimes and often nothing comes of it. But this one seems to me like the real deal. Of course, they haven't asked my opinion yet.This novel really surprised me and I\u2019m very glad I took a chance on it. Highly recommended.Thanks to Goodreads and to the publisher for letting me have a chance to read and review the book through the Goodreads Giveaway program."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "This is one of the best science fiction thrillers i\u2019ve read in AGES. If you like Mathew Reilly or James Rollins, this is very much for you.Opening with a horror movie/Indiana Jones moment that sets the scene with terrifying screams in the dark, it then switches to a more chatty, diary style narrative related directly to the reader by amateur archaeologist, Nolan Moore. He walks the fine line of being both cocky and amusing, managing to be genuinely appealing by acknowledging his foibles and worldweary attitude with the kind of humour that makes you lough out loud. He starts as a bit of a cliche, just how you\u2019d imagine his character to be if it adhered to every stereotypical book/film/tv version that came before, but early glimpses of something more genuine stops you from writing him off completely. He\u2019s far from perfect, but he\u2019s relatable, understandable, and most of all, funny. In fact, the whole group has the kind of arseholey camaraderie that feels entirely familiar. The draw is immediate- this could actually be you and your mates on an adventure. Who would think twice about exploring the Grand Canyon? Looking in that cave? Filming it for internet likes? It\u2019s blindingly plausible. The fact that these people are running a blog to investigate conspiracies/myths just makes it all the more authentic. Rutger gets the tone exactly right. And I mean, exactly. From the character dialogue to their changing emotions as shit starts to get difficult, it feels right. And because it feels right, it feels real. That\u2019s important because the readers know something the characters don\u2019t\u2026 there\u2019s something relentlessly savage in that cave. It means there\u2019s a delicious clash between the tension we get as readers and their growing uncertainty. Rutger doesn\u2019t rush to this point, there\u2019s a gradual, balanced build up of tension as they work their way towards the successful discovery of the cave and then as they examine it. And all the time, they act like normal people. There\u2019s no gung-ho bullshit, no ignoring of the obvious dangers. They reference the films we\u2019ve all seen, the monsters in the dark, they joke about horrible outcomes. They do what we all would to laugh it off, there\u2019s caution and reluctance, they fear the dark. As things go wrong, they increasingly sense a wrongness beyond the normal bad luck of an expedition gone bad, but unlike us, right up to the last minute, they don\u2019t KNOW. We\u2019re just gleefully waiting for it to happen. At the same time, the veracity of the character action and conversation means readers too have that slight hesitation, that nervousness, because we know that what they\u2019re doing is just what we\u2019d be doing too\u2026and we remember that we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s coming for us, I mean, them\u2026. Like so many offerings in this genre, the reveal dulled the shine somewhat. It felt a bit rushed in parts, especially because I was hoping for more death. Those that occurred were suitably horrifying, being bloodily detailed and stomach-clenchingly violent, but all the drama was over all too soon, and didn\u2019t quite match the promise of the slow build. The sci fi parts were a little crazy, but perhaps left some freedom for future exploration in more books? Until the end, conversations about ancient communities, artefacts, and archaeology had the ring of truth because so much was based on genuine historical reasoning. Rutger clearly did his research and much of the information is based on extant historical evidence, with a few conspiracy theories thrown in for added thrills. This provided a solid foundation and worked well to give Nolan authenticity, but wasn\u2019t quite enough to justify the underlying supernatural \u2018science\u2019 of the finale. It might seem strange thing to say in this kind of novel, but the manufactured bits needed to be a bit more substantial. Despite the few flaws, it\u2019s still the kind of book that makes you want to check the dark corners of your house. I hope it\u2019s the start of a series, I could read a boat load more of these.ARC via Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Thebooktrail", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25264586-thebooktrail", "userReview": "I read this at nightI couldn't sleepI was transfixed by those mountains, that Canyon, that cavernWhat an adventure!I've been trekking in the Grand Canyon but nothing like this!

Except Anomaly isn't Rollins, it's Rutger - a pseudonym for a California-based screenwriter - who lacks Rollins' ability to slow boil a reader in how implausibly nuts his plots are until it's too late to care.To his credit, Rutger starts out with a killer premise: Over a hundred years ago, a Smithsonian-funded exhibition to a cave discovered high on a cliff wall in the Grand Canyon turned up a handful of unusual relics before being suddenly abandoned and covered-up by the museum. Former screenwriter and current host of The Anomaly Files - think a History Channel-does-The X-Files YouTube series - Nolan Moore thinks he's managed to pinpoint the location of the lost cave, and he and his producer and crew, shadowed by a skeptical journalist and the flower-child representative of the Woo-Woo group funding them, head into the canyon in the hopes of filming something spectacular enough to help them make the jump from 'netcast to cable. What they find, etc. etc., cue weirdness and screaming and the occasional gruesome death.Rutger has a nice touch with dialogue, and it's refreshing that Nolan, through whose eyes we see the action, isn't your traditionally cut A-list macho lead - he's middle aged and feeling it, just old enough and slightly overweight enough to feel moderately annoyed by his younger, hotter cameraman, but not so testosterone soaked that he feels the need to do anything more than roll his eyes at himself about it. Generally, though, the characters are completely flat, and I say that as someone who loved foul-mouthed, hard-drinking producer Ken, who was nothing but attitude and appetite. Ken is actually the perfect horror-movie comic-relief sidekick (the job description of which generally requires some flatness of character), but what works on film fares less well on the page, particularly when the rest of your cast are mobile cardboard cut outs. A strong plot or deft sense of horror could have compensated for the character issues -after all, you don't need to know much or feel much about redshirts - but in the end the story is simply too silly and the author too squeamish. The Anomaly Files feels like a pilot Rutger's pitching, and some of its problems are likely due to him not wanting to limit future options. Unfortunately for him, there are other authors out there doing the same pseudo-science-action-horror shtick - some of whom are doing it much, much better - and his novel is less an Anomaly in the genre than a mediocre average."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40307260-wendy", "userReview": "What a belter of a book.

Nolan Moore, our main character, is a lot like Josh Gates. He and his group travel around the world trying to prove or disprove things that are otherwise dismissed as \"myth\" or \"legend\". They don't enjoy quite the same status as Mr. Gates and co however.Nolan, a former screenwriter, hit a roadblock in his career. He developed a case of writers block that seemed unending. So he quit writing and with the help of a few others launched a Youtube channel dedicated to finding things that modern science scoffs at as fantasy. It has a small following of the eccentric and weird, but is nothing notable.In fact, they've actually never been able to find or prove anything. At this point they're barely scraping by, they aren't even sure they can afford to do another season. It's a stroke of luck when a corporation takes an interest in their show and offers them a donation, the catch? They have to hunt down a specific cave in the sprawling crevices of the Grand Canyon. Problem is they aren't actually sure this cave exists. Except for some old newspaper articles, no one has ever found it.Turns out, the cave does exist. Nolan and his team feel like their time has finally come, not only have they made their first discovery, they found something of historical significance. This could be the turning point in all their careers.Only, the cave isn't what they expected. It's full of all kinds of strange things. Shapes that aren't natural. Drawings that resemble Hopi pictographs of monsters and animals that aren't natural to the area. A written language that no one has ever seen before.Their explorations are rewarded when they suddenly find themselves trapped within the cave. Their guide left them to get more food, their food and water are practically gone, and the only person to escape is helpless to do anything or get any help without a boat.Too bad that isn't even the worst part. The cave, it turns out, is hiding a secret. A secret that could rewrite history, shred apart the theory of evolution, and change the meaning of thousands of years worth of written and oral history from the bible to legends passed down by the indigenous people of the Americas and the Middle East.And that secret just woke up, thousands of years before it's supposed too.This book will take you on a wild ride. Filled with suspense, mystery, and intrigue. This is a fast paced page turner that I found very difficult to put down. The cast of characters were all well written, if a bit stereotypical, but that doesn't take away from the story. In fact, I think the characters are what make the story. Nolan's interactions with the other characters and internal dialogue keep the book from getting too bland or too dark. There's lighthearted moments mixed in, keeping the suspense and mystery from getting too old. It also gives the characters another dimension, they aren't all as they seem on the surface.The nearly the entire story takes place in the cave, which at first I dreaded the thought of, but the author manages to make this singular environment both terrifying and mysterious. This maybe the first time I've ever thought a story that took place in a confined area was so interesting (I'm looking at you Silent Hill 4).This book is definitely worth the read for people who are fans of Indiana Jones, X-Files, Destination Truth/Expedition Unknown, or who just love adventure stories with so many twists and turns, you'll be thinking about it long after the story ends."}, {"userName": "Fred", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63876193-fred", "userReview": "This is a doozy of a thriller.

In Arizona to film another episode for their small market YouTube show starring Nolan Moore, the crew is tired, cranky, and desperately in need of a smoke, a drink, and fresh air from one another. They have a big day tomorrow when they will raft through the Grand Canyon in search of Kincaid\u2019s Cavern, a basically unknown anomaly that was reported found, and lost, sometime before 1909.Nolan Moore, the protagonist, and his producer, Ken, his literal antagonist, have worked together on The Anomaly Files for years. Ken has taken out mortgages on his house because he believes in Nolan; and he believes the Cavern exists. As he and Nolan trade good-natured, testosterone-infused barbs, they also constantly smoke and drink to excess.The crew is rounded out by Molly, the AP with the phone constantly attached to her ear; Pierre, the \u201cpointlessly good-looking\u201d cameraman; Feather, the hippy-dippy rep from the foundation funding this expedition; and Gemma, the skeptical journalist covering the trip. Each adds a different flavor to the story. Nolan is obsessed with Kincaid\u2019s story because he hinted at finding \u201cwonders\u201d in the cavern after bringing back only a few ordinary artifacts: what did Kincaid find and what was he hiding? No one has since found the cavern and he never went back. Why, Nolan ponders on his blog, is it \u201cA truth we are not being told\u201d? Then ends the entry with \u201cIn the search for truth, it matters not whether we find, it matters only that we continue to seek.\u201dNolan is full of quotables.To say they eventually find the Cavern is not giving away the story. But what they do find is pretty wild and I love the what, the how, and the why of what is in that cavern.It\u2019s an imaginative tale starring some interesting, and amusing, characters. Everyone looks to Nolan for leadership when in fact he regards Molly as the \u201cmom in charge\u201d. Pierre borrows Nolan\u2019s shirt for a long distance shot of him climbing a cliff face so Nolan looks extra-kickass. That\u2019s dedication and Hollywood right there. Feather and Gemma have a lovely passive-aggressive relationship. And, Ken? Well, he drinks so much I was worried that he, and Nolan, for that matter, was going to go into DT\u2019s in that cave. While the writing is not the most solid, I found the author was able to recreate a truly claustrophobic reaction in me as I read. I mentally cringed as the characters crawled through tiny fissures and under gigantic rock overhangs and prayed their flashlights wouldn\u2019t die. Caves are scary. And dark.And full of wonders.The story ends with an opening for maybe another story, another episode in The Anomaly Files, and, if so, I will definitely read it."}, {"userName": "Sarah  Perry", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14740620-sarah-perry", "userReview": "As soon as I read the description of this book, I knew right away I would enjoy it. I was eagerly anticipating it's arrival after winning a copy through a Goodreads giveaway. Rutger sends his characters on an intense adventure exploring a cave that they never actually expected to find, only to find the true horror that lies inside. I was so surprised by a few parts of the storyline, which was nice because it's hard to do that and each one kept me more and more on my toes. I liked the characters overall, Ken being my favourite. He provided so much comic relief and his relationship with Nolan was unique and refreshing for me in a way. He just kind of owned his strengths and weaknesses in a humorous way.The comic relief was a great addition to the building tensions and the impending struggles that they faced. I felt my heart racing a few times and I was definitely on the edge of my seat. I found myself wanting to make as much time to read as possible. It has been a long while since a book has done that for me. So, thank you Mr. Rutger.I see this being made into a movie quickly. It is THAT amazing. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the horror and thriller genre or to anyone who has an adventurous spirit. You won't even begin to believe what this cave has in store for Nolan and his team!"}, {"userName": "Caitlin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68373069-caitlin", "userReview": "Thank you to Michael Rutger and the publisher for the free advance copy!What a thrill-ride! Nolan Moore is a quasi-celebrity with a YouTube show where he investigates a variety of conspiracy theories with the aim of \"seeking the truth\" along with his trusty production team. They hit their big break when a heretofore unheard of foundation offers to fund them, enabling them to make the jump from YouTube to cable.Their first big episode is looking for Kincaid's cavern - a cave in the Grand Canyon discovered by a team of explorers in the early 1900s but which no one has seen since. Nolan, his two trusty, wise-cracking producers, Ken and Molly, surprisingly buff cameraman Pierre set out to find it. They are joined by 2 tourists - Gemma, a sardonic journalist who makes no attempt to conceal her contempt for Nolan and gang and Feather, new-age hippy type sent along by the foundation to observe on their behalf.No one expects to find the cave and when they do, things get weird, then weirder, then downright terrifying.The cast of characters was great - they were all well fleshed out and you genuinely cared about them before long. The plot starts out slow, letting you get to know the cast, and then heats up and clicks along at breakneck speed.I was happy to read this and would recommend to fans of horror and conspiracy theory-focused speculative fiction."}, {"userName": "Susan Chow-Dukhan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56710716-susan-chow-dukhan", "userReview": "n 1909, the Phoenix Gazette carried a story about a cave of interconnecting tunnels and rooms discovered by G.E. Kincaid in the Grand Canyon containing artifacts of an Asian or Egyptian nature. The cave was subsequently closed off and that section of the canyon was designated off-limits to the public by the government. The artifacts extracted by G.E. Kincaid disappeared, leaving people to believe that the story was a publicity hoax (since the Smithsonian had no record of Mr. Kincaid), or that there was a government conspiracy to cover up what was in the cave (similar to reports of extraterrestrial bodies/vehicle found in Area 51).The Anomaly transitions the reader from fact to fiction, as we follow a TV production crew, filming the search for Kincaid's Cave, and what happens after they find the cave. It is a suspenseful novel, as the cast of characters are trapped inside the cave as strange things begin to happen. The reader feels empathy for the production crew, as most people have a fear of unknown threats that may be hiding in the darkness, when they are lost and defenseless."}, {"userName": "Lisa Henderson-Farr", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7228449-lisa-henderson-farr", "userReview": "I received an advance copy of this book through the Goodreads Giveaway contest in exchange for an honest review.A team led by Nolan Moore is looking for a cavern located in the Grand Canyon that was written about by an explorer in 1909. Nolan is trying to prove if this is a true account or not.His team finds the cavern which has mysteriously been sealed to prevent anyone from entering. But why was it sealed? Once they gain entry things take a turn for the worse. It now becomes a fight for survival.It is very obvious that this book was written by a screenwriter as the book plays out like a movie. A movie I would definitely want to see. In fact I think this would be more enjoyable as a movie. It brings to mind Thunderhead by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child which was a much better read, for me anyway. As adventure stories go it probably isn't my favourite but it was a fast read that kept me interested till the last page."}, {"userName": "Tricia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1655175-tricia", "userReview": "I was really interested in reading this so much so that I moved this to the top of my reading list.The Anomaly grabbed my attention right away and that was because the characters are intriguing and the dialogue and banter between them, especially Ken and Nolan, is light and fun/funny except of course when we get to the center of the story.Nolan Moore is the host of a TV series and in this instance, he has expedited a trip to the Grand Canyon to find and explore a cave's existence or not that is surrounded by conspiracy theories.I really liked the story and couldn't wait to continue and finish the book, it's fast-paced and a quick read. I found this storyline so intriguing when the crucial part is revealed I paused a bit because it is quite unique I think but I just went with it and enjoyed the ride. For me, there were many exciting parts of the story and I really enjoyed The Anomaly from start to finish and I can't wait to see what comes next from Michael Rutger."}, {"userName": "Heather Warner", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70896861-heather-warner", "userReview": "I really liked this book-the storyline was addictive! The fact that Michael Rutger based this book on a news report from the early 1900\u2019s made it even more fascinating. The ending of the story made perfect sense based on the mystery of the cavern. I do wish there was a little more depth/story to the foundation but that is really just my curiosity. I found all of the characters especially Nolan and Ken very interesting and I want to get to know all of them in real life! I think all the character conversations were quite good-I especially appreciated the humor! The descriptions of the Grand Canyon and Kincaid\u2019s Cavern were amazing, especially the darkness, oppressiveness & neverending corridors in the cavern-I could feel exactly how the group felt. Overall-really good book, very believable, interesting mystery, great characters & dialogue, lots of adventure.....definitely worth the read! I look forward to more from Mr. Rutger!"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5142817-mary", "userReview": "so i was pretty impressed by this book. it was heavily reminscent of the arcadian series by greig beck, less the military aspect. the entire first third of the book was a setting up of the scene. i gotta hand it to the author for not making a single part, even this one, dull. there were some great ideas put forth, and really, the whole premise of a podcast/webshow made for a perfect way to keep those ideas from sounding too fantastical. the very guy who came up with out-of-the-box theories, was the same guy who was all 'but ok yeah, thats far-fetched and fuck me'. im so glad i won the arc of this book. i dont know if i would have stumbled upon this author on my own. now? im really hoping this is the start to a series. i would be all in on that. in any case, im looking up the author to see what else he has published."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22418929-kate", "userReview": "This was a chore to read, really. I received it through Amazon Vine, expecting it to be a claustrophobic thriller about a team of amateurish explorers trying to locate a hidden cave within the Grand Canyon. The tag-line to this book's promotional material asks if you would dare to put this book down. My answer to this was, yes, I would dare. The question was, would I dare pick it back up again?! Well, I did manage to slog through it, it truly feels as though it has taken me ages to finish it; I am finally looking forward to being able to read something next which hopefully will capture my attention and imagination. Personally, for me, this book had little to redeem it. The eventual storyline was so far-fetched and out there, that it really did just put the final nail in the coffin for me. Rather than it being a terrifying, claustrophobic tale, it just turned out to be plain weird."}], "description": "Not all secrets are meant to be found.If Indiana Jones lived in the X-Files era, he might bear at least a passing resemblance to Nolan Moore -- a rogue archaeologist hosting a documentary series derisively dismissed by the \"real\" experts, but beloved of conspiracy theorists.Nolan sets out to retrace the steps of an explorer from 1909 who claimed to have discovered a mysterious cavern high up in the ancient rock of the Grand Canyon. And, for once, he may have actually found what he seeks. Then the trip takes a nasty turn, and the cave begins turning against them in mysterious ways.Nolan's story becomes one of survival against seemingly impossible odds.
