It reminds me very much of the freeflowing histories written by Marquez and Allende, as well as Salman Rushdie's strange little one-off treatise on cultural alienation, Fury. (Samad, in particular, reminds me quite a bit of Fury's Malik Solanka.)The book does many things well. Smith has a serious ear for dialogue and accent, she knows how to manage the flow and pacing of a story, and she's quite skilled at employing large concepts (genetic manipulation, immigrant psychology, the concept of history itself) both as fact and as metaphor. Her cast of characters is varied and nearly every one of them comes off as a fully flesh and blood human being. However, it's in terms of these personalities that I feel she makes her biggest misstep.Zadie Smith is what I'd call an Ironist. I don't mean this in the Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Jon Stewart sense. I don't mean that she's a comedian. I mean it in the sense that the territory she stands on--that her narrator in White Teeth stands on--is one whose boundaries are staked out in terms of what she is not. My friend Brandon commented below that Smith shows \"blatant contempt for every character except the one who is clearly based on the author.\" While I understand where he's coming from, I don't think it's contempt per se. On the contrary, I think Smith has deep feelings for most of her characters--even the more despicable ones like Crispin and Millat. I think that what Brandon interprets as contempt is something far more ambiguous: let's call it detached superiority.The Ironist defines herself through the process of over-defining others. Every character in this novel is over-defined, over-drawn. While this provides us with a great, at times excruciating level of detail, it also paints each of them into a kind of cage wherein all of their actions are predictable. Each of them has a sort of \"final vocabulary\" (cf. Rorty) that defines the limits of what they might do or say--the doctrines of Islam and the Watchtower Society, of PETA or clinical science. In the worst cases, their adherence to these vocabularies allows Smith to slip them into easy \"types\" (see: Mr. Topps, Crispin, Joshua, Marcus, the various members of FATE). Smith creates her authorial/narrative identity--what's called a metastable personality--by passively proving that she is not limited by such a final vocabulary, and that in escaping their confines she has a broader, more comprehensive view of the social workings of the world. This is, generally speaking, the goal of any omniscient narrator, but the way that Smith goes about writing this one in particular imparts a certain sense of smugness (the parenthetical asides to the reader, the knowing winks, the jokes at the expense of easy targets) that isn't always present.The metastable personality is the natural reaction to uncomfortability with final vocabularies, but it itself is of course just as self-defining as any of them (albeit in the opposite direction). It instinctually yearns for instability, but prefers to admire chaos from afar rather than living in it. The metastable personality knows that in order to maintain coherence it must remain stable, and that the only way to remain stable is to balance itself on the disbelief of all known final vocabularies. Smith writes off worldview after worldview, but is of course unable to articulate her own because her own is simply the absence of adherence to any such worldview.This isn't so much a criticism of Smith's work as it is an explanation of why it is the way it is, and why it can be read as contempt."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "One star? Of course this is not a one-star wretched ignominous failure, this is a mighty Dickensian epic about modern Britain. But not for me. It's a question of tone. I have now tried to read this one twice and each time I find I'm groaning quietly and grinding my teeth. Zadie Smith's omniscient narrator, alas for me, has an air of horrible smirkiness, like a friend who just can't help pointing out all the less than pleasant attributes of everyone else, all in the name of life-affirming humour, allegedly, but gradually wearing you down. Didn't anyone get sick of this apart from me? I hear this kind of humour in current British comedy all the time. When it's cranked up to the max and runs at 200 miles an hour, it's great, as in the recent political satire movie In the Loop (recommended) but when it's on a low leisurely level, as in a big sprawling novel, it just gets on my wick. It might be a symptom of the cultural cringe I discuss a propos The Age of Elegance - British writers can no longer take their country and culture that seriously, they feel somehow that it's  just not very cool  and so their default attitude is self-deprecation. You don't get this in big novels about modern America - \"American Pastoral\", \"We Were the Mulvaneys\" and \"The Corrections\" and \"Freedom\" spring to mind. Franzen, for instance, uses humour all the time and excoriates large areas of American society, but there's no perpetual undermining of his own characters for the sake of inexpensive laughs. My head says I should like White Teeth but my heart says Zadie Smith was a literary ad-man's dream come true. For a good, funny book about multicultural Britain, see \"The Buddha of Suburbia\" by Hanif Kureishi.

It approached greatness in many ways---the clever and often hilarious dialogue, the quirky characters, the creative family histories, the rich and convincing place descriptions, and so on. Despite the strengths of each of these parts, as a whole the book fell far short of greatness. It took me until the final pages to figure out what was missing for me: I did not genuinely care about most of the characters. I did not feel sympathy for them, or root for them, or have my own ideas of how I hoped things would turn out. This is likely due to the many, many story lines at play in the novel (story lines that span a hundred years in some cases). But it still felt unacceptable to me that the book begins with one of the most intimate moments a person can experience (though it is treated with humor) and closes with an equally major event in the life of that same character, yet we hardly KNOW this character. He is a central presence on page one and the final page, but he is lost in between. While I laughed at Joyce Chalfen, Alsana, Abdul-Mickey, Magid, Hortense, and a dozen more amusing and creative characters, I felt no emotional connection to them at all. The biggest disappointment perhaps was the disappearance of Clara's voice from the pages. They remained, though entertaining, very flat to me. The only character I sincerely rooted for and felt drawn to was Irie Jones. Her story alone, though it does not emerge until the second half of the book, made the novel worth reading to me.I was intrigued enough by Zadie Smith's writing to give her other works a try, but I closed the book last night with a definite sense of a letdown."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\u201c...the wicked lie, that the past is always tense and the future, perfect.\u201d \u2015 Zadie Smith, White TeethI planned on writing my full review of this book a couple days after I read it in October of 2014. I was afraid, however, if I wrote it immediately it would be too sappy, too indulgent, too full of praise. I would probably just go on and on and you all might think I was in love or something. So, like I am want, I put the review off -- meaning to get to it -- and here I am finally writing about the book almost two years after I first read it. I don't know if the delay points more towards my sometimes best laid plans falling and failing, or my anal need to complete the circle and check things off lists.Seriously, the book was fantastic. I loved it. It was a big, hairy, kinky, ambitious first novel and Zadie Smith pulled it off. I'm not sure why I'm reading so many novels (McTeague) concerned with dentistry and teeth lately. A bit weird. Anyway, enough!I'm glad I waited, however, because Zadie Smith seems to posses for England that same fresh breath that Lin-Manuel Miranda exhibits with his musical Hamilton. Sometimes, a place is best described by immigrants to that place. Sometimes, the change that happens to a city or nation because of immigrants is hard to measure in the first couple years. Just look at London now. London has elected its first Muslim mayor. This has more to do with some of the huge demographic changes than with a super-multiculturalism in London, but it still isn't nothing. I remember reading a short article in the Guardian a while back that pointed out that in regards to Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh, \u201cthe three groups share many areas in common, but the Punjabi Sikhs in Southall and southeast London, the Gujarati Hindus in northwest London, and the Bengali Muslims in Tower Hamlets stand out most of all.\u201d (The Guardian). I loved realizing the London of Pepys, Dickens and Shakespeare was now a completely different place. It was a place where the colonized were becoming the colonizers. It was a giant geography of Karma, and not in a bad way. We often never fully grasp the bad and the good and the unintended of our decisions and policies. I'm pretty damn sure Queen Victoria and those who advised her and followed her -- NEVER saw this coming as they began the British Raj. I love how 'White Teeth' swirls and dances and dervishes with ideas of race, identity, and religious antagonism. The book is a fiction, of course, but the competition between ethnicities, even while the white majority loses their shit is not fiction. Even though 'White Teeth' debuted as the 21st century was dawning, it painted a fictionalized but very real novel about the struggles America, England, and Europe are going through right now. Think of Europe and America's reaction to Muslim refugees, the hostility of the right to Barack Obama citizenship and race, the fear that drives the radical right agendas from Hungary to Norway as Western Europe and Western Civilization loses (gradually) their majority lock on political and demographic power. When the mayor of London and the President of the United States of America wouldn't have been allowed to eat in the same high-brow London and New York clubs as presidents and mayors did 60-years-ago, it is kinda amazing to see how far we've come. However, it is also humbling when you read blogs, comments, and hell, just watch Trump on Fox News. There is a certain shaded infinity of how far we still need to go.Anyway, back to 'White Teeth'. The brilliance of this book is Zadie Smith addresses all of this with humor, beauty and narrative magic. She avoids the twin traps of triviality and preachiness. She spins a fascinating yarn that entertains while pushing the reader to grapple with the realities that were faced by Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal in 1945, and the realities we faced when Obama was elected, and the problems we all currently face. Fundamentally, I believe, things become a lot simpler when we can view people as individuals. Viewing Zadie Smith as an individual it is easy to see her brilliance, her potential, and her ability from her first book to play with the big boys of English fiction. The future is already here and Zadie Smith is just waiting for history and the rest of us to catch up."}, {"userName": "Samadrita", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita", "userReview": "There are parts of this book fully deserving of unadulterated love and veneration, worthy of 4 stars in the least. The fact that the real Indian, Jamaican and Bangladeshi diaspora are reproduced here and not the imagined Indian, Jamaican and Bangladeshi diaspora of white writers too reluctant to put in the requisite amount of research for getting the most inconsequential tidbits right has much to do with it. In addition, Zadie Smith succeeds in keenly evoking their history, language, cultural ethos, the stench of their festering old wounds inflicted by an undo-able past, and their bizarre hypocrisies making the leap across land and oceanic borders into alien territory, exempted from being dissected by the scalpel of 'western reason' in the name of minority rights. There's the undeniable truth of centuries of conditioned servility, hatred of the power which established the ground rules of the abusive relationship called colonialism, and the unfathomable responsibility of bearing the burden of yesterday. \n\"[] they can't help but reenaact the dash they once made from one land to another, from one faith to another, from one brown mother country in to the pale, freckled arms of an imperial sovereign.\"\nThere's the Bengaliness of the family to be religiously guarded against the sallies of Western liberalism; imminent dilution of the much treasured Bengali DNA in the gene pool staved off at all costs. And there's war to be waged on foreign territory - for another inch of land, another notch up on the dignity scale, for yet another step of the socioeconomic ladder. Whenever stung by the prick of casual racism, whenever thwarted, they will go back to their institutionalized tendencies of seeing things in black and white and studiously avoiding mentions of a gray area; they won't think twice before disregarding their favorite Gandhiji's famed 'An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind.' They will seek out the greener pastures of first world optimism but resist synthesis, tugging at the roots of old grudges again and again so that the present and the now can be drawn and quartered on the altar of history.\"And then you begin to give up the very idea of belonging. Suddenly this thing, this belonging, it seems like some long, dirty lie...and I begin to believe that birthplaces are accidents, that everything is an accident.\"But then there are the 'just-roll-with-it' parts which deserve no more than 2 stars - the cocksure and smug tone in which the narrator recounts this multi-generational saga of families caught in the chaos of modern day materialism vs heritage, the unrealistic, often two-dimensional characterization and the zany Britcom feel to the episodes which warrants a suspension of disbelief and gives rise to the nagging suspicion that this was written with the idea of a film or tv series adaptation in mind. As much as Smith's light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek, clever mockery of roots and righteous reliance on said roots for existential validation is absolutely legitimate and spot-on, it is awfully disingenuous to think roots can and should be so easily discarded. Assimilation requires time and the immigration conundrum will never be felt as acutely by second generation immigrants (like Smith herself) as by their progenitors. This is where I prefer Jhumpa Lahiri's narrative voice (her later works) over Smith's - no inflection of moral and intellectual superiority, no pronouncing of judgement on flawed choices but a restrained attempt at humanizing all characters. Since the 4-star and 2-star ratings are equally bona fide in my eyes, a 3-star it is. More so because I can't remember the last time a woman writer of contemporary literary fiction made me laugh so hard."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/276109-dan", "userReview": "This book started bad for me and just got worse. I found the characters to be boring and two-dimensional. Actually, even worse, the author tried to build up the characters in most cases (though doing a poor job, I'd say), but then later reduced their roles to caricatures. So even those I was inclined to like wound up irritating me every time they opened their mouths.Further, Smith's style is all over the place. At times I found it indulgent and pretentious, others fawningly resembling other authors, and the style would sometimes change abruptly from one paragraph to the next.I find what what often at least partially redeems books like this is an interesting plot. Not so in White Teeth! There's no real story arc to hold the book together. The plot kind of twisted along for a while and I couldn't really tell where it was going. Then it ends in this bizarre attempt to draw all of the characters and threads together which totally fails as a climax. I would have been more irritated about this particular point but I was so happy I was done with the book, I was inclined to forgive it more than was deserved.I truly don't understand what all the hype was over this book. There is lots I can forgive especially in a first novel, but there wasn't nearly enough here to convince me that Smith is a great writer who just needs some time to come into her own. There were a few interesting ideas and notions, but they were isolated and swamped by a thousand other boring ones, not to mention cliches, unclever witticisms, and tired plot devices.I could go on, but I rather forget I ever read this!

My reticence to read the novel revolved around the plethora of book-clubby texts that could best be classified as \u201csomewhat patronizing novels about other cultures featuring triumph in the face of great poverty and hardship.\u201d I hate these books. But White Teeth turns out be an example of where those novels fail and a sun-surface hot writer can embrace the complexity inherent in both the smaller and larger narratives of multiple generations. Zadie Smith's talent and enthusiasm are tangible; she writes like she's bouncing up and down in her seat. White Teeth is as much about inertia as free will. Samad and Archie, brought together by their bad luck and questionable soldiering circumstances, spend much of their time in a decrepit English pub. Archie marries a Jamaican woman he meets on a stairway at a stranger's New Year's Day party. Samad's wife, Alsana, and Archie's wife, Clara, form a careful friendship. The friends' children are first-generation English carrying histories and expectations; Samad and Alsana's twin boys and Archie and Clara's daughter inhabit the no man's land between tradition and the present that, really, is everyone's land. Questions of loyalty, tradition, and identity emerge in the flash of conflict and creaking, inevitable societal evolution. As Alsana notes, circumstances emerge in which people are involved, to use her word, without intention but without question. When the two families encounter the white, affluent Chalfens, the cheeriest, most cluelessly evil parents I may have ever encountered in literature, twin brothers reunite (or at least occupy the same country), and the book's last hundred pages race to a thriller-esque ending that, while not tying every loose end, left me feeling as if I had read a singular, satisfying novel. Smith doesn't rely on easy, obvious immigration issues to drive White Teeth; she goes much deeper into characters' minds and families without preaching.I hope I'm not making White Teeth sound pious. In fact, I would argue Smith wrote the novel in part as a reaction to the piety that obscures truthful narrative. She builds each character from the ground up and knows when to move from one to the next. I'm also not sure if I understood every metaphorical nuance; I'm not English, Bengali, Muslim, or a Jehovah's Witness, all elements intrinsic to the storyline, so I most likely missed symbolic elements. While I don't want to minimize the immigrant experience, white readers, I believe, feel some of the same vertigo as the characters when navigating a landscape with different cultural touchstones, e.g. signs in Polish and Korean up and down Chicago's Milwaukee Avenue. Zadie Smith doesn't praise or criticize these landscapes. She focuses on the fear and hope inherent in characters' reactions to the stimuli. The players can't control the landscape as much as accept and respond to it. This is a sprawling, well-structured novel. White Teeth is a near-masterwork, the best book I've ever read about different cultures' slow, tectonic plate-like creep past, toward, and into each other."}, {"userName": "Aubrey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey", "userReview": "There need to be more books like this in the world. Little bit cocky, little bit sharp, written within my lifetime by someone with little to no representation in the halls of esteemed literature by means of race and gender and what have you and does not give a flying fuck about it. The setting may be the well worn island of merry old 20th century England for the most part, but the reality is that of the 21st. Smorgasbord where white men get as proper a representation in the wider plain of reality as demonstrated by their worldy demographic percentages, rather than the plague of pretense sludging its way out of the past and into modern day entertainment maintaining against all odds that women are objects and people of color haven't been invented yet? Yes please.I've noticed a common tone of grimaces and smirks at the college days of dorm room philosophizing, BYOB's galore in the booze and bong and Bourdieu, and I have to say, why? Shell out thousands for tuition, break your back and brain on everything so that you may make a living and never live it for the rest of your days, so that we may scoff at and scorn the few moments youthful selves stretched out their mind out of their own true volition? For if that's your habitus, you're not going to like this book at all. There's no college here, mind you, nor the slightest hint of academic satire beyond the teachers and the parents and the volcanic smoldering that is the thousands of fags smoked in every courtyard of a colonial workhouse turned school. Rather, there's that periodic expounding on the smaller things in view of the bigger and vice versa, the sociopolitical/cultural/religious -isms galore in tidbits between plot and character and the standard rest, enough that I've just gone back to shove that four star up to a dazzling five because fuck it, I'd have to read ten of the classics to get the amount of true and glorious angry pointing out the lies and filth and prejudice of our world, our times. You say Middlemarch, I say been there, loved that, but these days of mine are played to the tune of \"It's a Small Cosmopolitan World After All\", and ivory towers just aren't going to cut it any more, no matter how well intentioned or lucky in hotfooting it out of hell. Heard of the Bechdel Test? Try the variant for people of color, or perhaps the Mako Mori Test. True, the book didn't pass the Russo Test, but there's a reason why I'm on the lookout for more Zadie titles to grace my shelves.Now, since one side of my family has been in area of the later named United States since the 1600's, while the other is claimed to have been wandering around since the 1500's by an especially fervent Great Aunt, my sense of being an immigrant is nigh nonexistent. Thus, I'm not going to do anything inane like compare this work to the likes of Lahiri and Kogawa and other variations in the theme and said that the way the subject was handled felt more or less real to me. However, if you couldn't tell by my rant above, Zadie seized on the true and utter consequences of the people perceived as other migrating to and living in the country of the \"self\" perceivers and got angry about it. The result is an admittedly hilarious and corkscrew escapade across a multivarious cast of at least four generations, but the righteous fury is there, enough that I'm amazed I haven't come across one of those reviews decrying it for being \"too political\" or whatever the term is for authors mixing their Entertainment with Truth. Regarding said reviews, I have seen ones dismissing the characters as unsympathetic caricatures, bemoaning the conclusion, wielding hedge clippers at the plot, what have you. To that I say...ehh. It's been a while since my baseline lay along those particular lines, and seeing how this reading turned out niggling doubts and annoyance free, I'd say I'm the better for it."}, {"userName": "Stephen M", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3712181-stephen-m", "userReview": "So my computer has been out of commission for the past few weeks and that partly explains my absence from goodreads (insert excuse about being busy, being outdoors in the summer, etc).

I seriously almost didn't make it through this read, and it is only in the looking back that I see just how brilliant it is. Smith starts with two characters, then links character after character to them. It all starts with two men lost in WWI, having no real role in it, and discover it has ended without their knowledge. They capture a war architect after the war and invent stories in some attempt to claim true manhood. There is so much story in between. Two twin brothers, one who is sent back to the Middle East in hopes of retaining the Muslim ways. The other fully engaged in all things secular. Smith does a lot of meandering, but in the end, what do a fundamentalist Muslim, a Jehovah's Witness, and ardent animal rights activists have in common? Sounds like a joke, but as it turns out, quite a lot.A few things this book had me thinking about.-How science and religion have become polarized.-How different one generation is from the next, and how this impacts both.-Many things are not at all what we expect.-What defines manhood.-How black and white thinking is so dangerous.-How one action leads to unforeseen others, and all of life seems connected.My only real problem with this read was the length of the meandering narratives."}, {"userName": "Peter Boyle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter-boyle", "userReview": "Wow, what a lot to take in!

Along the way themes such as race relations, religious extremism, immigration, and even the ethics of genetic engineering are explored, all with an intoxicating energy and a sparkling sense of humour.The aspect of the book I admired most was its focus on family. Both the Iqbal and Jones clans are dysfunctional in their own way - obstacles such as marital infidelity and fundamentalism serve to threaten the family unit. Continents may divide them, conflicting ideologies might drive them apart but there is a familial bond that will never break and an unconditional love for one another that will always exist (even though they may be slow to admit this at times).The story is dizzying in scope and though are numerous plot threads to tie up, it all comes together in an immensely satisfying finale.

Racismo, crisis de identidad basadas en historia y tradici\u00f3n, lealtad hacia ideales tanto religiosos como humanos, fundamentalismo y un profundo y marcado anhelo de hallar un hogar en un mundo siempre ajeno a uno mismo son algunos de los elementos que componen White Teeth.

Lo esencial en esto es que, a pesar de dichas diferencias, estas dos familias se relacionan entre s\u00ed sin mayores inconvenientes, hasta incluso encuentran pertenencia de forma cruzada.Resumiendo, en su primera novela Zadie Smith ha sabido desarrollar una historia estupenda, con personajes complejos y entra\u00f1ables, mucho humor, emoci\u00f3n e inteligencia, todo esto sin ignorar la escritura, que es magistral.

You hand over your passport at the check-in, you get stamped, you want to make a little money, get yourself started... but you mean to go back! Who would want to stay? Cold, wet, miserable; terrible food, dreadful newspapers - who would want to stay? In a place where you are never welcomed, only tolerated. Just tolerated. Like you are an animal finally house-trained.Despite everything subsequent in Zadie's mad output, I still regard this a jewel. Following the dictum of Elvis Costello, Zadie distilled a lifetime into this first novel and had six months to write her second. I've said for over a decade that I am confident that people will read White Teeth one hundred years from now. I mean, narf, it has gen-mod lab mice, activists and AIDS, fry-ups and Jehovah's Witnesses, all the while speaking in accent about 'tangs and irie.

It's insane to think Zadie was practically my age when she began writing this book. How she pulled off accurately depicting 3 different cultures is beyond me, but she did it with wit and grit. By no means is the book perfection, but it is wonderful. I assure you, it's unlike anything you've ever read. There is an air of confidence Zadie writes with which I loved. The story overall is funny but it does deal with complex topics such as culture clash, identity crisis, immigrant experiences, parenting etc. Thankfully the dialogue makes it easy to get through quick. (I took a decade bc I was reading it off/on). My only issue was the ending, it climaxed then fell into a mush of nothingness for me. Maybe it's just me not grasping the ending, maybe it is clever in an odd way BUT I JUST DIDN'T GET IT. If the book closed off better, this would've been a 5 star read for me.

Millat ends up smoking pot, turning punk, test-driving all women he comes in contact with, admiring the Bruce Willis kind of action heroes and joining a militant Muslim group called KEVIN. Magid becomes an eccentric well-mannered nerdy scientist who wants to be a lawyer, after his dad abducted him and send him back to the old country to become accustomed with the old traditions and religion. But Magid ends up coming back an atheist and more British than the Brits themselves. Both sons become something Samad never wanted them to be.Archie Jones, the only 'real Brit' in the situation, is the beginning and ending of the narrative - the last man standing in any situation. He married the toothless Clara, an immigr\u00e9 from Jamaica. Her grandmother, Hortense, is a staunch Jahova's Witness who stuck to her believes through thick and thin. Clara is much younger than Archie. Their union produces Irie - an agnostic seeker of love and peace. An intelligent young lady who never loses her sense of balance. Archie and Samat come a very long way and became the best of friends since the second World War. Their two different versions of Samat's great great Grandfather, Mangal Pande's history, keep them in debate ever since they became friends. Samat says to Archie in one of their many discussions of the matter in O'Connolls: \"Of course I see your point of view, Achie, I do. But my point is, and has always been, from the very first time we discussed the subject; my point is that this is not the full story. And yes, I realize that we have several times thoroughly investigated the matter, but the fact remains: full stories are as rare as honesty, precious as diamonds. If you are lucky enough to uncover one, a full story will sit in your brain like lead. They are difficult. They are long-winded. They are epic. They are like the stories God tells: full of impossibly particular information. You don't find them in the dictionary.\"This is what the book is all about. The full, long-winded, difficult, epic around the particular information(history) of three families, their cultures, religions and all the issues of modern life in the western world of London.The third family, with the agnostic Jewish scientist prof. Marcus Chalfen with his wife, Joyce and their brilliant sons living out their Chalfenism, get the time bomb ticking for the final scene when he releases his research on genetic manipulation on a mouse which he plans to patent, copyright and bar code! The FutureMouse\u00a9 would ultimately portray and repeat the legend of Samat's great-great grandfather, Mangal Pande which began\" in the spring of 1857 in a factory in Dum-Dum a new kind of bullet went into production. Designed to be used in English guns by Indian soldiers, like most bullets at the time, they had casing that must be bitten in order to fit the barrel. There seemed nothing exceptional about them, until it was discovered by some canny factory worker that they were covered in a grease - a grease made from the fat of pigs, monstrous to Muslims, and the fat of cows, sacred to Hindus. It was an innocent mistake - as far as anything is innocent on stolen land - an infamous British blunder.........Under the specious pretext of new weaponry, the English were intending to destroy their caste, their honour, their standing in the eyes of God and men - everything, in short, that made life worth living.....\"The launch of FutureMouse\u00a9 guarantees a surprising ending to a tragicomedy, very well told and very well presented by Zadie Smith. There are no lose ends left behind.It is, in fact, a book I would love to read again! There are so many layers of humanity and cultures exposed in the book, and relentlessly made fun of in many aspects, that it can really be enjoyed a second time. It will be worth it !I really LIKED IT!"}, {"userName": "Ted", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7213075-ted", "userReview": "Fifteen years ago, when I read this, I thought it was the best contemporary fiction I'd read in ages.

My father was the first member of his family born in Canada. He desperately felt the need to fit in, to be Canadian. As a result, when his parents spoke in Danish at home, he always answered them in English. In later life, he could understand Danish, but not speak it, a situation which was sometimes frustrating when dealing with relatives who only spoke Danish. My grandfather came to Canada first, alone, and started out working in the lumber camps of Northern Alberta. He was a religious man and was mortified when he learned that the first English words that he acquired were cuss words. My grandmother is my hero\u2014she came by boat to Quebec and then boarded a train to come to Western Canada. She spoke no English and no French, had 3 small children, a bag of apples, and no money. And yet they all made it to Athabasca to meet Grandpa.Now, you may think that Danish immigrants would have felt a warm welcome in Canada in the late 1920s/early 1930s. Still, they didn\u2019t fit in because they didn\u2019t yet speak English and they had some different customs. Also, the Danes and the Ukrainians settled in the same area and there was some kind of weird rivalry between the two ethnic groups. Several generations later, and both groups of immigrants fit into Canada like they have always been here. It\u2019s hardest for the first two generations.So I could identify in a small way with the situation in White Teeth where people trace their heritage back to Jamaica and Bangladesh and are trying to fit into an overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon society. \nBut it makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist, scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation, when this is small fry, peanuts compared to what the immigrant fears\u2014dissolution, disappearance.\nWhen your culture is very different from the new country (like Samad and Alsana\u2019s Islamic life), you dread your children acclimatizing to their new surroundings\u2014the religion that you cherish has potential to be lost (Magid) or changed until its unrecognizable (Millat). Contrast that with ever-so-Anglo-Saxon Archie, who ends up with a black daughter. Irie will always be considered foreign, even though she has just as many English ancestors as many Caucasian English, and she really feels her foreign-ness despite being born in North London. Hence her romantic notions of \u201cthe homeland\u201d of Jamaica. It\u2019s amusing to watch Archie\u2014unworthy recipient of white male privilege\u2014seemingly unaware of all the ramifications of racial and class politics that swirl around him. Samad is the intellectual of the two and his intelligence is rarely recognized, while stolid, thick Archie wanders through life seemingly without impediment. Samad is torn between wanting the pleasurable things of life and being a devout Muslim. He literally tears his twin sons apart, sending Magid back to Bangladesh to become a \u201cgood boy\u201d and leaving Millat in London, taking on the bad-boy half of the equation (and in many ways, living out some of his father\u2019s desires).There are lots of good things and many shrewd observations in WT, but to my way of thinking there were too many ideas being bandied about. It seemed to try to tackle everything: colonization, migration, class, race, prejudice, history, genetics\u2014all intertwined, but maybe a bite that is just a little too big to chew. No wonder the book is over 400 pages.Two weeks ago, I went to our university\u2019s distinguished lecturer series to hear the author, Zadie Smith, speak. As a result, I having been hearing her lovely voice in my mind\u2019s ear as I read, as if she is reading the novel to me. If you ever get a chance to hear her in person, go, do it. She is every bit as direct and funny as her prose would lead you to believe.

A decade down the line and this is still a dazzling performance. A mordant look at first-generation Bengali immigrants and the next generation's confused Anglicization and alienation. A scalpel-sharp realist novel with teeth sharper than a puma. Plus (near the end) a witty debate on religion v. science. And so much more besides. Not head-over-heels in love with that ending.

Dentes Brancos relata a hist\u00f3ria de tr\u00eas fam\u00edlias que vivem em Londres, durante o per\u00edodo de tempo entre 1974 e 1992:Os Jones - Archie Jones \u00e9 um ingl\u00eas (ex-suicida) de meia idade casado com Clara, uma jovem jamaicana cuja m\u00e3e \u00e9 testemunha de Jeov\u00e1 e que tem como \u00fanico sonho manter-se viva para assistir ao fim do mundo.Os Iqbal - s\u00e3o um casal de emigrantes mu\u00e7ulmanos, oriundos do Bangladesh.

This book is about nature vs nurture. Don't worry about that theme too much, because this book hates its theme. It can't be bothered to come to a logical or even an irrational conclusion about that theme. It hates its theme nearly as much as it hates you, the reader. Didn't I just say that? Am I being redundant? Right, there is too much, let me sum up.Basic Storytelling annoyances: It would have been nice if the author could have picked less than 10 main characters to focus on. Or, would have stopped introducing characters long before the second to last chapter. (Tangential annoyance: This late group of card-board cut out characters is created to mock pretentious college student types (oh, the inadvertent irony), but is a complete regurgitation of Monty Python's \"what have the Romans ever done for us?\" scene from Life of Brian. Just a general Boo out to that.)Or, if the characters were anything but stereotypical one dimensional shadow puppets with two modes: Shouty and Really Shouty.The Narrator attempts to convince the reader (the hated reader) that racial stereotypes shouting at each other is funny. The Narrator will put a \"Funny Here Marker\" in her dialogue to underline what is supposed to be funny. The FHM is easy to spot; it is a F-bomb if its really funny or an \"assing\" or \"bastard\" if it is (supposedly) mildly amusing. Truth be told, in the 70000 or so pages, I may have accidentally chuckled at some bits, but it is really too painful to remember now.Intermediate storytelling annoyances: Don't continue a scene when the Point of View Character has left that scene. Abrupt use of flashback and flash-forward highlights the thin, uncertain texture of your narrative. Never be afraid to use one word, whereas three will annoy your readers (the hated readers). Plot, generally nice to have. Drama is not shouty, mean people being mean and shouty to each other. Exposition. Dear Cthulhu! the Narrator is an exposition machine. Please stop the expositioning. Being told the the backstory of every random character who pops in to be belittled and mocked is both unwanted and unwise. Advanced Annoyances: Stop being redundant. Redundancy, stop. The redundant things, they are being, they must stop. Everything is said at least three times in the book. Three times. Some things are said six or more times. Thrip x20. Very. If the Narrator says Very something, it will be said at least twice. It is infuriating. And it is not just words. Whole scenes are redundant and are put in just to drive the reader (the hated reader - ok you get it, I'll stop) insane.Extreme Annoyances: A third of the way into this book, just when the barrage of unfunny sitcom scenarios has numbed the reader into submission, the Narrator starts throwing in little clues, hints, that the Narrator knows exactly what it is doing. And She is not just mocking the poor characters, but you, the reader. Little bits about \"Corkscrew dialogue\" and \"redundant writing\" shows up. What is Corkscrew dialogue? Google doesn't know. The only thing I can think of is this - this book is corkscrew dialogue. It goes around and around, seemingly going deep beneath the surface, but not really moving at all. And the cork - that sucker broke off. No wine for you.Shaking that paranoia off, I continue. At the end of the day, this 'story' is just a bunch of shallow characters shouting religious catchphrases at each other. There is some non-sense about Nazis (Cthulhu help you if you fall for the \"OMG FATE!\" moment) thrown in at the end to make this 'story' weighty, but it is just more out of nowhere, hand waving junk that doesn't work, because the smug, beyond omniscient Narrator hasn't earned it.

And the fact that I don't \nsee\n what she sees in these novels, doesn't bother me in the least. I'm just happy to know that she wants to share her books with me. And of course, there's always that little delight to factor in that I take in recommending my romance novels to Kinga in return. :)So what's that got to do with this book? Nothing, really. Except to illustrate how I lack the refined palate to appreciate these novels that she continues to shove so lovingly into my hands.However, a few thoughts on this novel. Try as I might I failed to really care about most of the characters. That alone tends to doom a novel. Then there's the terrible smugness of the narrator, and by extension, the author. World! I am writing a great novel.The level of detail was simply too much. Every character it seems was drawn (and drawn out) in overdone detail pretty much making the novel twice as long as it could/should have been.

Sometimes, here in England, especially at bus-stops and on the daytime soaps, you heard people say \u201cWe\u2019re involved with each other,\u201d as if this were a most wonderful state to be in, as if one chose it and enjoyed it. Alsana never thought of it that way. Involved happened over a long period of time, pulling you in like quicksand. Involved is what befell the moon-faced Alsana Begum and the handsome Samad Miah one week after they\u2019d been pushed into a Delhi breakfast room together and informed they were to marry. Involved was the result when Clara Bowden met Archie Jones at the bottom of some stairs. Involved swallowed up a girl called Ambrosia and a boy called Charlie (yes, Clara had told her that sorry tale) the second they kissed in the larder of a guest house. Involved is neither good, nor bad. It is just a consequence of living, a consequence of occupation and immigration, of empires and expansion, of living in each other\u2019s pockets\u2026 one becomes involved and it is a long trek back to being uninvolved. Involvement in one way or another is what this entire book is about: individuals' self involvement, intimate involvement, social involvement, cultural involvement, etc. Broad themes are approached on personal levels. Smith uses her characters' relationships to discuss the issues of religious and cultural differences, ideological conflict, racism, nationalism, class-ism, and sexuality, all in an English prism. Smith's writing is generally entrancing, quick, and sharp. Her style is not romantic, it is unvarnished and blunt, but it also can ramble delightfully on down the chasm of a character's mind - I recognize this type of chaotic, off-the-rails thought process as something I myself am prone to, especially in times of stress, and for this reason I have a special appreciation for these often dark leaps and tangled asides. Smith's dialogue is often word fencing between characters, but it's not passionless clever wit, quite the opposite, the reader gets a great sense of the emotion imbued in each of the character's words. Our characters are numerous, but predominantly the reader is following the lives of two families of mixed cultural and national backgrounds and all are unique and yet products of their histories alike. Often I found myself despising some of the individual's decisions or turns, but understanding them, much like if they were members of your own family. My only complaint comes from the times in the book where things are being brought together, buttoned-up as it were, these parts seemed forced, as if Smith is attempting to be too clever at the expense of the story. Not every individual story-line has to come together in a tidy bow, and neither does a title have to be a theme craftily/forcibly sprinkled/shoved in a dozen different literary orifices (slight pet peeve). These slight annoyances are forgivable in light of the beautifully written remaining 99%. Other themes include: aborted/failed life ending (whether that be homicide or suicide), genetic engineering, fry-ups, loveless(?) marriages, coin flipping, and Niece-of-Shame!"}, {"userName": "Leo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/892667-leo", "userReview": "So it's not perfect. I understand that.But I can't remember the last time a book this long has thoroughly captivated me, entertained me and struck a subtle chord in me all at the same time.A lot of other reviews have valid points: all the characters do diminish into caricatures at certain points (but don't we as well?), the last hundred pages or so were a bit tiring, and the ending felt a bit anticlimactic and rushed.My favorite aspect of this novel was Smith's keen eye for turning entirely serious and sometimes overwhelmingly heavy situations into somewhat humorous snippets of life--all without relying on too much levity or a sense of defeat. It's a refreshing change of pace from my usual sullen and deeply cynical reading repertoire.And besides, when the hell do you ever get to read about characters who are people of color with actual internal, middle-class dilemmas that aren't wrought in cheesy sentimentality and a guilty liberal consciousness of \"getting in touch with your roots to find your true self\" (I'm looking at you, Jhumpa Lahiri)? Assimilation (either in part or in full) IS a part of adjusting within a different country, after all.p.s.: I do not understand some reviewers' point about her seeming \"smugness.\" Race-relations are pretty much shit everywhere. What did you expect, an open-armed happy convert who gets shat on but learns to take it and becomes grateful for all the injustice? If you were a racial minority in a country where nearly 90% of the country is white and had the privilege to be well-educated to write from a critical viewpoint of something that, indeed, deserves some criticism, wouldn't you? And isn't it natural to have some manifestation of resentment mixed in there somewhere? I don't think it's as big of a deal as everyone is making it out to be."}], "description": "One of the most talked about fictional debuts ever, White Teeth is a funny, generous, big-hearted novel, adored by critics and readers alike.
