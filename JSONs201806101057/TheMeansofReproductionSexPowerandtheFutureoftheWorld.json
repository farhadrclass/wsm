Michelle Goldberg shares the economic, health, and demographic consequences of countries and policies that prevent women from having control over their own bodies. Exploring Africa, Asia, Europe, and more, she connects the overarching oppression of women to the daily feelings and struggles of individual women worldwide. Goldberg addresses how complex issues like population control and feminist movements interact in unique, context-specific ways. On a personal note, reading this book made me even more mad at America's religious conservatives who blockade women's access to abortion overseas; our country's imperialism often causes so much harm. One quote about childbearing and liberation I liked:\"There is abundant evidence that if you want women in modern economies to have more babies, you need to help them reconcile work and childbearing, not encourage their subjection. In developing countries a lower status for women is associated with higher fertility, but once societies become highly industrialized and women taste a certain amount of liberation, the opposite is true. 'Whereas previously the countries with the highest period fertility rates were those in which family-oriented cultural traditions were most pronounced and in which women's labor market participation was least, these relationships are now wholly reversed,' wrote the political scientist Francis G. Castles.\" I appreciated Goldberg's sensitivity to cultural issues such as female genital mutilation. While she has a pro-feminist, pro-choice, anti-oppression bias - which I share - she captures multiple sides of arguments to give voice to various people of color, whose perspectives often get erased. I only lower my rating because I found parts of the book dry, such that they read like a series of facts as opposed to anything with more voice or style. Still, I found The Means of Reproduction a worthwhile read for anyone interested in global women's reproductive health. I will end this review with a quote from the final section of the book that captures Goldberg's overall thesis:\"But the oppression of women doesn't create order; it creates profound social deformities. It is universal the way violence is universal; both are atavisms that successful societies must contain and transcend. Liberty, ultimately, is something women in every society will have to win for themselves. It cannot be bequeathed by donors or mandated by treaties of courts. It can, however, be either supported or thwarted by international forces, which is why we all share some responsibility, some stake. Women's rights alone will not solve our massive problems, but none of them can be solved unless women are free.\""}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-chris", "userReview": "Tired of hearing about the magic sperm rejecting powers of women's bodies? Want to smack people who simply say \"she should keep her legs closed\"?Read this.A few months ago, my local NPR hosted a radio program about proposed changes to PA's abortion law. These changes would've included a vagina ultrasound as well making the woman carry around a picture from said ultrasound. The woman on the NPR show pointed out that in countries where men control reproduction that abortion is not really an issue of debate, and it's not because abortion doesn't exist in those places.Abortion is a complicted topic if only because of what everyone brings to the table. Both Pro-Choice and Pro-Life are valid points; however, taking about sperm killing powers of women's bodies during rape is not (and is what I have an issue with). Goldberg's look at the issue of reproduction covers abortion in terms of population control as well as the woman's right, but she also looks at other sorts of control over women and thier reproduction. It's a must read simply because it forces a closer look at the issue (like, more recently, NPR's Being program)."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2073876-jan", "userReview": "Goldberg's book is an overview of the international battle over women's reproductive rights throughout the last 50-60 years.The author clearly has a bias on this issue. She clearly thinks that reproductive rights and family planning are good and necessary. She is clearly pro-choice, pro-birth control, and anti-oppression. I happen to agree with her. However, I greatly admired that, despite her bias, she always included the arguments and reasonings of the people on the other side of the fence. I felt that she did so without condescension or judgment. I think that this is so important in the dialogue about such hot button topics. Personally, I'm tired of the \"'I disagree with you,' 'Well, if you disagree with me, you're a poopy face'\" rhetoric that seems to have taken over the U.S. national stage in the last 20-30 years. It's refreshing to read reasoned arguments.For example, I admired Goldberg's restraint in her chapter about female circumcision. This is a topic that I can barely even stand to think about. I could hardly even read the chapter. The thought of these procedures being done to young girls makes me sick to my stomach and furious. But I am grateful to Goldberg for including an even-toned explanation of why ANY woman would be for such procedures. I have never understood it before. I still disagree, but it's the first time that I've understood where such women are even coming from.But I digress. Overall, I found this book very interesting. It can be a little dry in parts, but I still found it fascinating to learn how the issue of reproductive rights even got started and found its way onto the international stage (pressure from the U.S., perhaps unsurprisingly). It was even more fascinating to learn about the mistakes the early movement made, which sowed a lot of the seeds that started the backlash against it. It was appalling to learn how much power the U.S. has in shaping the future of these issues in the world. And it was particularly interesting to learn a little bit about how these issues are viewed/handled in the rest of the world. The chapter on India's rampant problem with gender-specific abortions was riveting!I would hope that this book would be a tough read for anyone - the tendency throughout the world of societies to oppress women as a means to control scary cultural changes should depress/frighten any person, or at the very least any female. But I think that the book is a valuable read for anyone looking to understand these issues."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19669428-molly", "userReview": "This is a work of clunky and malicious propaganda. Anecdotes and misinformation are slapped together in a crass, manipulative pr style lamenting that Hitler and Sanjay Gandhi's \"excesses\" discredited eugenics. Under the flimsy veil of feminist concern for reproductive freedom, Goldberg launches a creepy white supremacist revival of eugenics mythology, bemoaning that there aren't enough \"Europeans\" but there are too many of everyone else. While the book purports to be a kind of history of \"overpopulation\" remedies, she never brings herself to say what's unsatisfactory about the population status quo; with snark alone she dismisses the consensus among social scientists regarding the anticommunist and imperialist motives for such programs and their crackpot Social Darwinist guiding philosophies. Goldberg defends Margaret Sanger's odious racism with childish vulgar historicism and at the same time seems to give credit to Sanger's absurd racial anthropology. From her own unjustified dogmatic position, she deploys this same racist paradigm to raise an alarm about Muslims conquering Europe by breeding populations of threatening Semitic aliens 'within their secular host societites.' Unsupported dogmatic statements are followed by streams of speculation and psychologistic fantasizing: John D Rockefeller III, we are told, was an \"altruistic\" man who funded the program that trained Mengele and founded the Population Council for selfless and laudable motives. Goldberg insists the 'modest' JD Rockefeller III was a man whose concerns that \"Modern civilization has reduced natural selection,saving more \u2018weak\u2019 lives and allowing them to reproduce,\" were prompted by \"compassion\" and whose project to reduce population growth among African-Americans, deemed \"socially inadequate\" by his organization, was admirable and benevolent. Goldberg insinuates that African Americans resisting these contraception and sterilization drives were mad, unenlightened and misguided militants. (The proof Goldberg offers of this \"fact\" of Rockefeller's benevolence, altruism and \"feminism\" is that an employee of his said he used to say he preferred to talk to the wives of politicians when dining at events.) Goldberg's final chapter \"the Birth Strike\" replicates all the nauseous phantasmagoric Islamophobic propaganda of Europe's extreme right, repeating the complaints expressed in the manifesto of the fascist mass murderer Andras Behring Breivik who slaughtered dozens of Norwegian students at a labour party summer camp for the declared purpose of terrorizing Norwegians into a white supremacist immigration policy. Like Goldberg, Breivik fretted in his manifesto that Europe was being destroyed from within by Muslim immigrants who took advantage of the sissified and weakened male that feminism had created in Europe. Goldberg shares Breivik's obsession with one Mullah Krekar, quoted by Breivik repeatedly and centrally staged by Goldberg in her depiction of the Muslim demographic menace posing a threat to \"European values\" (feminism, gay rights) and European standard of living (by, she suggests without a shred of evidence, reluctance to pay taxes to support their welfare states). While admitting that the \"conservative\" analysis that appear as Breivik's rationale for murdering socialist Norwegian schoolchildren is \"exaggerated\", Goldberg stresses it is \"not wrong.\" It's truly a disgusting performance, a wonky, genteel, euphemistic rehashing of Sanger's hideous exterminationist Pivot of Civilization, mixed with Malthus, Laughlin, the Ehrlichs, and a splash of Hitler. For a sane alternative on the topics this lunatic, unresearched and repulsive book treats, see _The Republic of Hunger and other essays_ by Utsa Patnaik, _The Crisis of Multiculturalism_ by Lentin and Titley, on these themes of the demographic Muslim intruder threat of \"Eurabia\" that Goldberg recycles, _the Myth of Population Control__, by Mahmood Mamdani (husband of director Mira Nair) and _the Legacy of Malthus_ by Allan Chase."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123323-rebecca", "userReview": "A good companion piece to Half the Sky, I dog-eared so many pages that I had to stop before the entire right corner of the book was folded down. I suppose I had some idea about a lot of the ground it covers, but never to the point where it really hit home exactly what is at stake. It starts out with the infuriating consequences that crop up when abortion is criminalized. The fact that women have died of ectopic pregnancies and incomplete miscarriages because doctors can't intervene before the fetus is technically dead is pretty sickening. In El Salvador, women coming in with miscarriages are reported to the attorney general for investigation. The whole idea of \"uterus as crime scene\" is pretty abhorrent to me though I guess Utah likes it. I don't understand the mindset behind forcing a 9-year-old to carry an incestuous rape pregnancy. From there the book moves on to attempts to rein in a possible overpopulation crisis worldwide. While it seems to be a noble goal that will give women a chance to control over their fertility, the people planning this seem to have cut the women themselves out of the equation hoping that the mere presence of contraception and abortion services would do the trick. I didn't know that at one point the Catholic church came close to reversing their long stance against contraception (apparently it is \"intrinsically evil\" which is a label not even applied to murder) but Pius XI issued Casti Connubii which pretty much concluded that since contraception had always been a no-no, it should stay that way otherwise the papacy might be seen as fallible. After that it's a continuation of an international movement in women's rights and the US's about-face where it tries to undo all of the good it did by disseminating information and resources towards women's health, backpedaling furiously in order to placate the newly minted Christian conservative movement and leaving a lot of dead women in its wake. Then there's a chapter on female circumcision and all of the attendant horrors that accompany it. Then comes the aftermath of population control where technology gets ahead of cultural enlightenment. With a more expedient way to check for female fetuses, most Indian castes used the advent of the ultrasound to weed out the unwanted girls to make room for boys in their two children households thus leading to wildly skewed sex ratios. The huge economic cost of girls through their dowries means that they can be treated terribly, assuming they're allowed to be born at all. Only by raising the status of women above chattel will girl children be valued enough to stop culling them so wantonly. India and China will likely face some pretty rough unrest as a result of the gender imbalance. It's scary to think of how it will all play out.This book does a good job of covering the bases of what happens when women are second-class citizens who don't control their own bodies. As with most other books on the same topic, the conclusion is that women have the power to save the world but only if they (we) have equal rights."}, {"userName": "Colleen Clark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/391193-colleen-clark", "userReview": "A first rate book covering the population crisis, women, sex, and reproduction from the 1960's to the present.

Topics covered include birth control, abortion, sterilization, female \"circumcision\", women's rights etc etc. Chronologically Goldberg reports from the 1960's to the 2000's - the involvement of the US and the UN; the politics and the changing social conversation within the US and around the world.

The author does a great job of explaining the fissures between the population control movement and those who want to empower women to make the best reproductive decisions that they can for themselves. This book truly helped me to realize for the first time that rather than an East-West split on human rights issues, there are civilizing and savage forces in all societies and that those who care about human rights must be the allies of people everywhere who seek human autonomy and the adversary of those everywhere who seek its opposite.

This is a must read for anyone concerned about global stability or human progress. The Means of Reproduction takes a tough and fascinating look at the global struggle to advance women's reproductive rights and the countervailing movement to restrict them. I've often found the jargon and clinical language of the global reproductive rights movement bewildering, and I speak as someone who spent a year working as a writer for an organization that plays an important role in that world. Goldberg translates the code into a terribly alive narrative of a never-fulfilled movement to achieve reproductive freedom for women. Yet the book also acknowledges, with great skill and sensitivity, that well-meaning efforts from within the movement to set limits on reproductive and bodily rights ultimately undermine the very cause of self-determinaton and equality they seek to promote, and her book comes to the difficult but necessary conclusion that within every society and code of law women must be free to make their own decisions.The U.S. has played both sides of this epic tug-of-war, and under the Obama administration will undoubtedly jump back on the team for reproductive rights. But as this book's journeys to India, Africa, and Latin America suggest, that project now needs to move forward to a whole other level - to concern itself, ultimately, with advancing women's freedom. Great combo of fresh from-the-scene reporting and thoughtful, provocative analysis."}, {"userName": "Emily Jane", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2349820-emily-jane", "userReview": "Like a lot of what I read, I heard about this one from an interview of the author on NPR. The thing that caught my ear was the mention of a woman who had willingly undergone female genital mutilation (FGM) as an adult, part of her full acceptance of into her ancestral Sierra Leonean tribe, despite having been born and raised in the United States.Back in college, I did a major report on FGM and have been fascinated by the practice ever since. I was 17 and had never known much outside my WASP-y hometown. A friend losing her virginity was shocking news to me at that time (it still is, to be honest), and reading first-hand accounts of FGM was enough to make me cross my legs and try not to pass out.In any case, The Means of Reproduction is a very interesting book. Goldman writes like someone who has been there, who has seen everything she describes with her own eyes. She makes no attempt to veil or even couch her feminist perspective. In addition to a look at FGM in Africa (which she weighs as both a brutal, anti-feminist practice and a lingering link to a world being phased out by neocolonialism - the opinion shared by the aforementioned Sierra Leone woman), Goldman also explores abortion around the world and the available of contraceptive methods, both of which have been alternately supported and denounced by the United States.This book did little to alter my budding feminism, which I derive, interestingly, from my Christian faith; but, it was a very readable and engaging exploration of the interrelated nature of women's rights and the well-being of world as a whole. All in all, a good read and one I recommend to feminists and non-feminists alike."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2958674-nikki", "userReview": "Overall The Means of Reproduction is well-written and informative. I think the opening chapter was jammed pack with information and expected you to have background information on South American issues that not many people are likely to have. This made the book have a shaky beginning for me and I worried that the entire book would be an attempt to jam as much information as possible into the pages, readability be damned. However, after this shaky beginning I found the topics and historical connections to issues more concise and readable. The topics vary but always come down to women's rights and how reproductive rights greatly impact the world as a whole. This is probably the first book of any kind I've read where the topic of female genital mutilation was actually discussed in-depth, with both sides of the issue portrayed. This is probably the most difficult chapter to get through but I think it was an important one. It is also difficult to swallow the fact the U.S. politics continue to impact world reproductive rights and health. Republicans being in the White House should not suddenly mean a woman halfway around the world will now die or suffer because she cannot have proper access to healthcare, including abortion.

This is not just a book about abortion rights,pro or con, in fact it often goes beyond the typical liberal thinking of sexual equality, not that the typical conservative thought will be happy with this work either; to talk of sexual equality is to talk of children and family as well as individual women; in fact in M. Goldberg\u2019s treatise, it is to address these rights not as an adjunct to the great themes of poverty, war, and peace, but to show their integral connection to so much in the human race.

Most books I've read have focused the struggle on the US, but this book really brings into view the larger picture. Goldberg starts by going into the history of the global reproductive rights movement, which really grew out of a desire to stem population growth back in the 1950s. The US was actually a large proponent of helping other countries to better plan their families, and so started funding for contraception, etc. I found it interesting (and sad) that by the time the right wing backlash occurred in the 1980s, family planning was something that many developing countries actively wanted, and when the US pulled funding, many clinics started closing down. The book covers a lot more ground than just contraception and abortion access. Goldberg devotes a chapter to Female Genital Mutilation and the attempts to curb the practice. She also covers the skewed sex ratios in India and Asia, where more boys are born than girls due to selective abortion of females.I like how Goldberg really brings together all aspects of the reproductive rights movement, and argues that without woman's empowerment, the population issue will never be solved. Women cannot effectively plan their families, stand up against FGM or stop the selective abortion of females if they don't have any agency. Goldberg also shows how birth rates actually increase (up to about replacement level) in countries where women have full rights and abilities to take paid maternal leave, which is something that countries such as Italy may want to take into account.Another important issue is that when the US swings from right to left, women are affected worldwide. Whether or not you are pro-choice or anti-choice, woman's clinics close when the right wing comes to power. This affects women's ability to obtain pap smears, maternal care, and, yes, safe abortions. (Illegal abortions are still a huge killer of women globally.)The only thing missing from the book, but understandably due to the scope, is a deeper look into the HIV/AIDS crisis and how it disproportionally affects women. Goldberg briefly covers it in the conclusion of the book.Overall an excellent book for those who want to get a bigger picture of the global struggle for women's rights and reproductive freedom."}, {"userName": "Bob Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22039713-bob-anderson", "userReview": "Goldberg\u2019s survey of women\u2019s power and rights in the modern era is fascinating and engaging, with a wide variety of subtopics and focuses that keep the pace moving and give readers of many interests something to dig their teeth into. The horrifying first chapter zeroes in on abortion politics in Nicaragua; the case of Rosa, a very young girl who was impregnated secretly by her stepfather and who the authorities denied an abortion, introduces the role of the Vatican in shaping regressive policies around the globe. The next few chapters chronicle the intertwining rises of population politics and global women\u2019s liberation. The highlight of these sections is Goldberg\u2019s analysis of the Vatican\u2019s alliance with regressive regimes around the world, including totalitarian Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa, to fight against the global expansion of women\u2019s rights. The close of the book was the strongest; she tackles the tough subject of sex-selective abortions and population growth (more accurately decline, I suppose) rates in industrialized countries. She makes a convincing case that despite these problems coinciding with the rise of contraception and abortion access in the world, the actual cause is still backwards views of the proper role of women in a society, and that countries which actually value motherhood and parenting instead of just demanding it (such as Sweden and France) see the modern perspective as one of growth and health instead of decline and sickness. The book is very interesting, with no chapters that I didn\u2019t find worth the read, though its depth is understandably lacking in several areas given its broad scope. One final note: although the title suggests a Marxist perspective on issue of reproductive rights, the text itself seemed much more mainstream liberal than that. This isn\u2019t a pro or a con to me, just an observation."}, {"userName": "Dante", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11658551-dante", "userReview": "This book tells the story of reproductive rights from the 1950's to now. The author tells the story from both the high perspective of the UN and international activists and stories from on the ground how reproductive rights actually look like in a country. Goldberg shows how the spread of reproductive rights began with efforts to control population, became explicitly pro-woman and how conservatives caused a backlash against reproductive rights. The author makes a persuasive case arguing that increasing women's rights, good in it's own right, also is effective at controlling population growth, preventing spread of STI's and reducing barbaric practices like FGM. Goldberg also tries to make the case that in developed countries more pro-women policies (specifically paid maternity leave, easy access to day care, and parental stipends) would create a higher birthrate (which many desire for political though arguably racist reasons). The case here is on shakier ground and she admits as much, but it is an important message nonetheless. Overall this book is amazing for its materialist, demographic and feminist bent. Many books can give you the history of women's movements and the arguments for women's equality. Goldberg's work is remarkable because it also gives a history of the material and demographic changes wrought by women's increasing equality (and by the changes wrought by the backlash against women's equality). This history is important in itself but Goldberg even goes a step further. She explains why this history demonstrates the material need for women's equality on a changing planet (and how it can help women's movements gain allies who may have less worthy objectives)."}, {"userName": "Zhang Jingjing", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43664345-zhang-jingjing", "userReview": "A book contains so many things that I'm really interested into, feminism, reproduction, globalization, how to see the conflicts between tradition, culture and changing society and values, what do we talk about if actually we don't have any choice, is there a place where people can have unlimited freedom without hurting other people, how to see the developed world's low fertility rate and its policies to limit the immigration, cultural relativism or cosmopolitanism? This book doesn't necessarily provide all the answers that I want to know, but it did bring me some insights and makes me to think more deeply and broadly, which is, even just for that, is worth reading.Although, I do hope that some of chapters can go a little deeper, and the author didn't talk about the people who chose to live a life without children, and I also believe that men should consider their reproductive rights and responsibilities too. But I really can't blame the author for that, if she tried to contain all this in her book, maybe it will be turn into a 500 pages one which may be over-whelming to read.Also, I do think that one-child policy is one of most misunderstood and treated unjustly policies in China and across the world, it reflects so many complicated things and differences between China and the rest of the world but I can't even find one book who really gave it a full image without the western \"default\" bias against it."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/368855-michelle", "userReview": "Everyone needs to read this book. First of all, it's an eye-opening history of how America used to shove family planning down the throats of the rest of the world (we forget that this was a bi-partisan, anti-Communist motivation for many years.) And then we suddenly turned around and said, \"no more condoms for you.\" You also get to learn from this book how the family planning issue came to dominate the Vatican, and how womens' rights is the answer to BOTH high birth rates in some countries and too low birth rates in others. Goldberg lays out a solid argument that the empowerment of women, including sponsored daycare and other help for working mothers in the West and grass-roots education and health care movements elsewhere, is essential to the future of our health, our environment, and the global economy.For me, this book was a page-turner. It really helped me place feminism in a global context, and was extremely illuminating. I would also recommend this book to people on any side of these issues. Goldberg is very good at showing all sides of the issues and gives a nuanced account of sensitive issues like America promoting abortion abroad and selected abortion of female fetuses in India."}], "description": "In this groundbreaking work of investigative journalism by the author of the New York Times bestseller Kingdom Coming, Michelle Goldberg exposes the global war on women's reproductive rights and its disastrous and unreported consequences for the future of global development Women's rights are often treated as mere appendages to great questions of war, peace, poverty, and economic development. But as networks of religious fundamentalists, feminists, and bureaucrats struggle to remake sexual and childbearing norms worldwide, the battle to control women's bodies has become a high-stakes enterprise, with the United States often supporting the most reactionary forces. In a work of incisive cultural analysis and deep reporting, Michelle Goldberg shows how the emancipation of women has become the key human rights struggle of the twenty-first century. The Means of Reproduction travels through four continents, examining issues such as abortion, female circumcision, and Asia's missing girls to show how the battle over women's bodies has been globalized and how, too often, the United States has joined sworn enemies such as Iran and Sudan in an axis of repression. Reporting with unique insight from both the rarefied realm of international policy and from individual women's lives, Goldberg elucidates the economic, demographic, and health consequences of women's oppression, which affect more than half the world's population. As The Means of Reproduction reveals, the conflict between self-determination and patriarchal tradition has come to define pressing questions of global development. Empowering women is the key to retarding the progress of AIDS, curbing overpopulation, and helping the third world climb out of poverty, but attempts to improve women's status elicit fierce opposition from conservatives who see women's submission as key to their own national or religious identity. From the anticommunist genesis of America's attempts to stem population growth in poor countries to the current worldwide attack on women's rights as a decadent Western imposition, Goldberg explores the interplay between the great issues of our time and the politics of sex and childbearing. Finally, The Means of Reproduction shows how women, strengthened by a solidarity that transcends borders, are fighting for freedom.", "title": "The Means of Reproduction: Sex, Power, and the Future of the World", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5997693-the-means-of-reproduction", "average": 4.03, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347670173l/5997693.jpg", "reviews": 95, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/84561.Michelle_Goldberg", "name": "Michelle Goldberg"}], "type": ["Feminism", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "History", "Sexuality"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5997693-the-means-of-reproduction", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6679002-the-means-of-reproduction", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146071.Kingdom_Coming", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318356-the-goddess-pose", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35842698-the-goddess-pose", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34877641-indra-devi-de-vrouw-die-yoga-naar-het-westen-bracht-een-biografie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39293274-the-munk-debate-on-political-correctness"]}
