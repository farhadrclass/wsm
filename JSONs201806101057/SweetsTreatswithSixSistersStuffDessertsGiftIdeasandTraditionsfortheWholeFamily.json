Whether I have them once a week or every day, my sweet tooth can't be curbed, so when a chance to review this book came up, I jumped on it! I've been following the Six Sisters' blog for a couple of years now and I love how their recipes are simple, yet satisfying. There are many comfort foods, as well as new recipes, and their desserts are some of my favorites.In the mood for cupcakes? This book has got you covered. Bars or brownies? It's got both of them, too. I love how most of the basic dessert categories are covered with a good variety of recipes. From bars, to cookies, to cakes, to ice cream, to cheesecakes, to candies/treats and more, this book is sure to have something to fit your mood or the season. I also loved how tips to share and show your treats are included. I decided to try a few different recipes and was pleased with the results. In fact, my husband wants to ban me from making treats for awhile because they're all oh-so-good. I tried the Nutella Brownies and the recipe was easy to follow. They turned out great and we couldn't get enough! I also made the Chocolate Marshmallow Cookies and they were a hit. The pictures for each recipe are well done and I also enjoy how each recipe gives a serving amount and a prep time, cook time, and total time. My 9-year-old daughter helped me make the Mini Pumpkin Pies and had so much fun with them. They're the perfect serving size for a person. She asked if she could help me make more recipes in this book and went through and found a bunch that she wants to try. There are many, many more that we're all looking forward to making, including the Slow Cooker Nut Clusters, Old Fashioned Vanilla Ice Cream, and Snickers Cupcakes, to name a few. This is a great book with a lot of possibilities.*I received a copy in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Lisa  (Bookworm Lisa)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/864649-lisa-bookworm-lisa", "userReview": "I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book because of the picture on the bottom right of the cover, Chocolate Raspberry Eclair Cake! I have not tried it yet because I am afraid of what will happen if I do. It looks amazing and the recipe looks easy to follow.I have made the Nutella Brownies, Vanilla Sugar Cookies, and Mint Oreo Brownies. All three were easy to make and tasty. I couldn't get my topping to look as fluffy on the Mint Oreo Brownies as it looks in the picture, but it was delicious.I work as a lunch lady and so I had a couple of my co-workers try out a recipe or two. One made the Rocky Road Popcorn and brought it in to share. It was addicting. I am not a big fan of marshmallows, but I really liked the whole package together. Another made the Brown Sugar Bars. She said that it was an easy recipe to do, but it was a little too sweet for her taste. Her son loved it though.The pictures in the book are beautiful. The recipes are easy to follow and for the times when my sweet tooth needs a little attention, this is a great recipe book to go to."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1425373-bonnie", "userReview": "I tasted some of the Six Sisters recipes at friends houses and have been surprised at how good the food has turned out. When the opportunity came to review this book I was excited to try it. Scanning through the recipe book the first thing I noticed was how easy the recipes were. To me, there's nothing more frustrating than being excited to try a recipe and not knowing what half of the ingredients are or how to follow the instructions. Most of the ingredients I already had on hand and the directions were very straight forward and easy to follow. That made me even more excited to experiment.To be honest, we're not a sweets family. Not because we don't like them but because we like them too much so we try to stay away from them. The recipes we've tried have been incredible. Even my husband, who is quite particular about his food, has loved each one. I have my list of recipes that I will continue to try and serve to friends and family. This is a great recipe book for anyone who loves sweets and easy enough for a novice."}, {"userName": "Leslie aka StoreyBook Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272944-leslie-aka-storeybook-reviews", "userReview": "I have another cookbook by Six Sisters and I have to say that this cookbook does not disappoint! All of the recipes are simple and do not call for ingredients that are hard to find. I made the S'more cookies for my book club as part of our cookie exchange and they were VERY tasty! My husband has looked at a few recipes that he wants me to make in the near future.I have a feeling this will be a go-to cookbook much like their other one.

I love Six Sisters' Stuff and use another cookbook of theirs all the time (especially when I need to take a treat to an activity) so I was excited to see what this book contained.This cookbook is absolutely perfect for someone like me. I enjoy baking more than cooking but I still don't like to take a lot of time. There are some more complex recipes in here but most of them are easy and don't take much time. They are filled with ingredients I've heard of and I have quite a few ingredients already on hand. I also love that they have pictures of every recipe so you get an idea of what it will look like, and that definitely makes more of them appealing.My daughter and I sat down and went through it page by page making a list of the recipes we wanted to bake. It was pretty long and with not too many days before my review, we were only able to get to a few of them. My daughter loves Red Velvet and they have a recipe for brownies and cake in here. The brownies were a hit! She also really liked the Cake Batter Blondies. She's got her eye on the Chocolate Raspberry Eclair Cake (pictured on the cover) but that one has to wait until I can try it, too.This book is packed with recipes for bars, brownies, cookies, cakes, cupcakes, cheesecake, ice cream cake, pies and no-bake treats. It will take us a while to work through the recipes that look good to us. In addition to the yummy recipes, they share ideas for movie night snacks (flavored popcorn!), a neighborhood cookie walk, packaging treats and much more! This is a book I will be using for many years to come!I received a copy of this cookbook to review. My opinion is 100% my own.Mel's Shelves"}, {"userName": "Maria Hoagland", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5579405-maria-hoagland", "userReview": "I have to admit, when I was given the opportunity to review this cookbook, it was a no-brainer, I mean, who doesn't like desserts, right? But I was a little worried, because most cookbooks I receive don't end up being something I use--either because they are too gourmet for my tastes, too complicated, or require things I never have around the house. This one is PERFECT! There's a variety of desserts--everything from cookies and brownies to pies and cheesecakes. They have fruity and chocolatey and everything in between. There are movie treats and desserts for formal soirees. Everything you could want. It will take me years to make everything in this book, but I can't wait to try!The recipes are easy and call for ingredients I surprisingly already have around the house. So far, what we've tried have been fabulous, and I'm looking forward to making more. As far as the book itself--the colors and photos are amazing. The layout is intuitive, and the directions are easy to follow. This book is a must-have for any kitchen.*I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "J", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5395404-j", "userReview": "*I received this book for free through Goodreads Giveaways*This is a gorgeous cookbook. When it comes to cookbooks I need a feast for my eyes as much as I do for my stomach. This book delivers both. Large full color pictures of the tastiest looking desserts ever. Ive already tried some out and YUM. The majority are quite easy to make. Someone mentioned the recipes are heavy on cake mixes. There are quite a few but honestly anything that makes baking faster and easier is a-okay with me. I hadn't heard of \"6 Sisters\" before winning this book but I will definitely check out dome of their other books."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489334-laura", "userReview": "There are so many amazing, easy recipes in here - I think I gained weight just reading the book! These girls really know how to add easy panache to celebrations. The highlights for me were a few of the bar recipes and the banoffee pie.There's no nutritional information (which may be a good thing). Also, I'd like a little more backstory on the recipes - they tell us when they serve it, but how did they come by it? The crafts and celebration ideas sprinkled throughout the book are fun and creative.This is a great series!"}, {"userName": "Alisa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/580777-alisa", "userReview": "This was a fun book if you like treats! I liked the separation into different categories of bars, cookies, ice cream, etc. We have made a couple of the recipes so far and they were a big hit. I really enjoy the ideas also in these cookbooks, such as how to wrap up treats in a fun way, or making a fondue date night. I love these cookbooks because (big hit for me) they have a picture for every recipe. Some of them make quite a large amount, so those are a bit tricky for my family, but overall very fun cookbook to have for treats purposes."}, {"userName": "Mary Beth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36937673-mary-beth", "userReview": "What a fun cookbook!
