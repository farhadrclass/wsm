I haven\u2019t read a book written by Nora Roberts in several years. When this one cropped up on my radar, due to some pretty heavy marketing, I stopped to check out the synopsis and realized it was a romantic suspense novel, and it was not a part of a series, so I added it to the TBR pile. For some reason, I have struggled with this review. I wrote down some thoughts, then scrapped them, at least three times. I dawdled so long the book was automatically returned to the library, along with all the notes I\u2019d saved. GRRR. But, the long and short of it is this - the book would have been amazing if it had been written as a straight up thriller. However, my attention was divided between two different threads for most of the book. One thread involved the long- ago disappearance of Bodine Longbow\u2019s, Aunt Alice, and the current day murders of two women. The second thread spotlights the challenges of Bo\u2019s job as the manager of the family\u2019s Montana resort, and the arrival of her brother\u2019s best friend, Cal Striker. Bo and Cal would like to see where their attraction to one another might lead, but there are a few heavy complications they must resolve first.To make matters more precarious, Cal\u2019s return happened to coincide with the recent murders, which puts him on the hot seat. The romantic elements, to be honest, felt forced. Bo\u2019s \u2018sex doesn\u2019t have to be complicated\u2019 act sucked all the passion out of the equation for me, as well as her pragmatism in other areas of her life. She was a little bland to me, despite her quick retorts and comebacks. I just didn\u2019t feel as though the couple had a real bond other than being hot for each other physically, and the only reason they jumped through all the hoops, was so they could hook up without ruffling anyone\u2019s feathers. As a result, the angst was too low key and the last- minute attachment of the HEA, fell flat. However, the suspense elements were outstanding! In fact, I wondered if Roberts\u2019 alter-ego, J.D. Robb, had begun to completely take over her personality, because this novel was so much darker than her usual fare, becoming downright gritty, as a matter of fact. The atmosphere was so tense and the situation so dire, it made me squirm a little, and I\u2019m a veteran reader of the most dark and twisted thrillers out there. Then there is the story of Aunt Alice, which deals with the familial bonds and resentments that have festered so long, finally coming to a head, and the resulting fallout.  The drama is absorbing and heartbreaking, but ultimately inspiring. It is also multi-generational, which gave the story more depth, with the added appeal of a family saga, which I am always a sucker for. Despite Roberts' reputation as the queen of romance, she can write a thriller right up there with the best of them, if she so desired. This set up, though, was a little rough around the edges. Romantic suspense can be a tricky blend, but this approach, while original, seemed to keep the two threads separated, so that they didn\u2019t feel like they belonged in the same book together, until the final few chapters, that is, where everything does wrap up nicely, I must admit. Overall, Alice\u2019s story is very, very good, as is the murder mystery, which kept me guessing until the bitter end. So, even though the romance was a dud, in my opinion, I still recommend this one to fans of RS or to those who enjoy tense, edgy thrillers. 3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Chelsea Humphrey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47207032-chelsea-humphrey", "userReview": "I finally popped my Nora Roberts cherry! :) I'm not sure why it's taken me so many years to pick up one of her books, but I'm sure glad I won this one, otherwise I may never have gotten around to reading it. Come Sundown is a perfect way to ease into her books; it's a standalone, so no worrying about committing to a series with 92 entries to date, and it is completely captivating with a fast pace alongside a dark, mysterious overtone. The thing that set this book apart from others of romantic suspense was the life she breathed into these deep, realistic characters. Roberts clearly knows how to produce a novel that is full of everything you want in domestic suspense, but her characters are what stole the show in my humble opinion. There were a few spots that felt a little fluffed up and I felt maybe 50 pages or so could have been shaved off, but otherwise this was a near perfect read. Highly recommended for fans of romantic suspense that don't want to sacrifice on characterization!*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my copy via Goodreads Giveaway!"}, {"userName": "Jonetta", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta", "userReview": "Originally posted on The Book NymphoI listened to this story without reading the book blurb and highly recommend doing it this way as I think too much is revealed in the setup. It's enough to know that this story involves the Bodine family of Western Montana, which includes four generations of women. The main character is Bodine Longbow, the youngest who runs the family's high-end resort. Her older brother runs the adjacent family ranch. Her childhood crush, Callen (Cal) Skinner returns back to the area following a stint in Hollywood and begins working for the family. The span of the story begins in 1991 and transitions to the present day for the first half of the book. It begins with the 1991 disappearance of Alice Bodine, Bodine's maternal aunt. It is a terrifying event and readers should be forewarned that there is a sexual assault though not graphic. In the present day, the bodies of two young women are discovered right around the time Cal returns so suspicion is cast his way. Therein lies the main conflict of the story.This was more of a mystery than suspense as I was challenged to figure out how the past influences the present, which I found more compelling. Even though my main hypothesis was correct, there were still some details I didn't get right. And, the characters were so well developed, typical of a Nora Roberts story, my early discovery didn't lessen my pleasure. The romances (there were a couple) took a back seat to the mystery element but were pleasant enough, also fine by me. What I found outstanding was the narration. This was my first time listening to Elisabeth Rodgers and I was extremely pleased. There were a LOT of characters, accents and ages she had to accommodate and I always knew who was talking. The voices of the primary characters were so distinctive and consistent. Well done!I liked this story and decided some time ago that I'd only listen to Nora's single titles, which are all romantic suspense. Best decision I ever made as her narrators are always really, really good and elevate the reading experience. That was definitely the case with this story, one that I very much enjoyed."}, {"userName": "CD {Boulder Blvd}", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31857175-cd-boulder-blvd", "userReview": "Review to come...My reaction to this book is very mixed. On one hand I could be really immersed in the story line of Alice and on the other hand I would get really bored by the day to day minutia of running the Bodine Resort. Still sorting out my thoughts...Even though it was dark, I really liked the story line of Alice and that's the part of the story that I was really pulled into.The trilogy aspect of NR gets old but I did like each of the characters within the 3 couples. I agree with a couple of other readers that a little more development around them would have been good. Each of the three romances were fairly tepid and there wasn't really any conflict to create interest around. I think I would have preferred more about the characters and less on the day to day running of the resort. The resort itself was only a backdrop to the plot so the pages and pages on running it didn't seem necessary. And the killer and the relationship was way too easy to figure out. And since it was so obvious, I almost would have preferred seeing more of his story so that he would have been more fleshed out."}, {"userName": "Sandra ~ \u2665 Cross My Heart \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17716247-sandra-cross-my-heart", "userReview": "*Reviewed at Cross My Heart Writings and Reviews**Many thanks to St. Martin's Press for an arc of this book.Come Sundown is a powerful, compelling story\u00a0showcasing the healing power of love and the amazing ability of the human soul and spirit\u00a0to survive and recover from unimaginable, mind altering\u00a0pain and sadistic evil.\u00a0 It\u2019s also the story of family doing what family does . . . loving unconditionally,\u00a0making and cherishing memories, surviving loss and pain, building a future on hopes and dreams.\u00a0 Nora Roberts\u00a0is a master\u00a0at writing about close-knit families bound by strong emotional ties whether related by blood, friendship, or romance, and we see that once again in this book.\u00a0\u00a0Four generations of\u00a0Bodine women,\u00a0working together with\u00a0the heart, gut, and grit of the pioneer women who first came west,\u00a0lay\u00a0the foundation\u00a0for this story.\u00a0 A strong,\u00a0rich support cast including family, friends, and co-workers\u00a0cements\u00a0this epic saga of perseverance and triumph,\u00a0with the added bonus of a friends to lovers romance (times 3).\u00a0 Two stories play out in Come Sundown\u00a0with one revealed through a series of flashbacks up until the point where the stories and\u00a0timelines merge.\u00a0 Two stories -

If I\u2019m sick or depressed or just stressed, she\u2019s my go-to fiction author. She\u2019s my literary popcorn. Her books are a bubblebath for my brain. There\u2019s something about her writing that just absorbs me from the first page, and her characters always feel like family. The work ethic of Nora Roberts astounds me. Every year, she puts out at least three (often four) new books. These are books that have never before been published. And no, she doesn\u2019t have a team of writers working under her name. If a book says it\u2019s written by Nora Roberts or her pen name, J.D. Robb, then she wrote it herself. And she\u2019s not doing this for money; with over two hundred books published, the woman is set for life. No, she writes because it\u2019s her passion, and I respect her immensely. Yes, her work is formulaic, but it\u2019s supposed to be!! I don\u2019t pick up her books to be surprised; I pick them up for their familiarity and the comfort that brings.Okay, end my gush-session over Nora. On to this actual book!Come Sundown is, like all of Nora\u2019s books, a story with family at its core. Whether borne of blood or forged by friendship, family is always the central theme of Nora\u2019s novels. This book takes place on the Bodine Ranch and Resort in the heart of Big Sky Country, otherwise known as Montana. Bodine Longbow is our female main character and manager of the resort side of her namesake. Callen Skinner, her brother\u2019s best friend and her own childhood crush, has returned home after leaving at eighteen to make a name for himself in Hollywood. He\u2019s the best horseman around, and owner of the most unique horse around, Sundown. This trick horse is more than just a horse to Cal; he\u2019s Cal\u2019s brother and friend. The relationship between the two is so sweet to read about, but the relationship between Cal and Bo is even more fun to watch blossom. As always, Nora is the queen of romance, and in this book we have one central romance, with two more budding romances on the periphery. But as stated previously, the core of this book isn\u2019t romance; it\u2019s family. And this family has a skeleton in their closet, one that reasserts itself in a brutal and heartbreaking way as the story progresses. I won\u2019t get into what this skeleton is, as it\u2019s a central plot point that I don\u2019t want to spoil, but it was harsh. I know terrible things happen in life, and that those terrible things can (and should) make their way into fiction. But at times, the experiences of one character were incredibly hard to read about. There should be a couple of trigger warnings with this book (especially for rape). But, though there were aspects of this book that were uncomfortably realistic, I knew that everything was going to be okay. The best part of Nora\u2019s books are the happy endings, and this book definitely delivered that. All in all, this was a great standalone offering from one of my favorite authors. It had romance and horse and gorgeous sunsets and family dinners filled with laughter. It had love conquering all and good triumphing over evil. If you\u2019re in the market for a romance with a surprising amount of substance but a guaranteed happy ending, I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23830302-mar-a-ngeles", "userReview": "Por fin mi primer libro de Nora Roberts.

Many people I\u2019m sure do the same, and that\u2019s why Roberts can afford to toss out this kind of crap. Brand recognition is priceless in marketing.Roberts wrote this story years ago, except it was titled Montana Sky, and it was so much better.Let me tell you what happened the first quarter\u2014or \u201cpart\u201d as Roberts likes to section it unnecessarily. We jump back and forth from past to present between a young woman who was abducted and forced to experience unspeakable horrors\u2014I mean, been there, done that, in Roberts\u2019 books alone\u2014and the heroine, who does the most truly fascinating thing I\u2019ve ever read\u2014she goes through her morning routine, then goes to work, puts together agendas, and attends meetings.Yeah. Seriously.This book was so boring that at one point, maybe about a third of the way through, I got sick of spacing off and having to reread passages that I just shook my head and started flipping through pages, trying to find something exciting or even just interesting. So many scenes were irrelevant to any plot, whether it was the thriller or the romances. Some scenes were fluffy bits of nonsense with one important line thrown in. What a tangled, tedious mess of tones and points of view. Just a mess.I knew Bo and Cal were supposed to be the main characters, but honestly, this wasn\u2019t their book. If it was anyone\u2019s, it was Alice\u2019s, though we got to spend time with just about everyone, which annoyed the crap out of me. There was no focus. The book wanted to be too many things at once, and ultimately didn\u2019t manage any of them. I didn\u2019t care about the characters. Cal\u2019s horse, Sundown, had more personality than he and Bo combined. And \u201cBodine Longbow\u201d? Really? Did Roberts find a name generator website, select the categories of \u2018hick\u2019 and \u2018western,\u2019 and go with the first random name it threw at her? She\u2019s used the name Bodine in at least two other books (Carolina Moon and Born in Shame, though in the former it was spelled \u201cBodeen\u201d).(Apologies to anyone named Bodine Longbow.)It was just such a retread of many of Roberts' books. The Bodine name, a ranch in Montana, all the siblings in the same family falling in love at the same time, a religious fanatic villain who takes the Bible literally, a not-so-unexpected family connection to the villain (I suspected him the moment I met him), and an obvious misdirect. There was even a wedding and the planning thereof. It's not identical to Montana Sky or any other book, but it's far too similar for its own good.So yeah, I didn\u2019t read the whole thing; I just read the parts that included Alice, because she was the most interesting character out of the lot, the only one with an arc. And honestly, I don\u2019t feel I missed anything.To be fair, though, the writing style was pretty good, even if the story crafted in that style was crap. Roberts is exceptionally talented\u2014if only she would write a story that isn\u2019t a waste of her time and ours. If I had any complaints about the writing itself, it would be that there wasn\u2019t enough action or physical description with dialogue, like mannerisms or facial expressions. We were largely left to assume the tone implied, and sometimes I had to stop and puzzle over the nuances within a conversation.

Every year the topic delves into something new and different. This author excels at researching new themes to such a depth that I finish the book with a sense of accomplishment and enrichment.Some of these books have been all time favorite novels and have earned a spot on my keeper shelf, others have been wonderfully entertaining - but every single one of them stood out because of the authors impeccable writing and unsurpassed storytelling.Come Sundown by Nora Roberts was no exception.This time the author took her novel to a Montana Dude Ranch/Resort. I've always wanted to go and spend a week at a Dude Ranch, so the topic couldn't have been more perfect for me.As it has been with many of her other books, the suspense kept me guessing until the very end. She has a talent of keeping the tension high and me on the edge of my seat. But the suspense alone wasn't what kept me turning the pages like crazy.\u00a0Come Sundown had an overflowing amount of fantastic characters. From close family to friends, employees and most of all an incredibly smart and well trained horse - the characters were the gems in this book. All of them were fantastic and lovable personalities that enriched my reading experience and left me wanting more. And even though the novel was 466 pages long, time flew by and I never once felt bored or wished it to be over - rather the opposite.The only thing I would have changed was the amount of time that Bodine and Callen spent together - it wasn't enough for my taste. Because of the all encompassing storyline that spanned generations, and truly had the feel of a saga, their relationship felt almost like an afterthought. I needed more Bo and Cal.That was especially hard to swallow since I truly enjoyed both Bodine and Callen. Bodine was an incredibly strong woman. She ran the family resort with efficiency, dedication and devotion. I was in AWE!!!And Callen was awesome in a very understated way. I loved his silent but strong demeanor and found his confidence sexy and incredibly attractive. And his way of standing behind a strong woman and supporting her in every way was unbelievably HOT!!!!Add a truly amazing and spellbinding storyline and Come Sundown easily kept me glued to the pages and I had a hard time putting it down.But that's something that can be expected from a\u00a0Nora Roberts\u00a0novel.

Be it a fantasy, hardcore romance or romantic suspense, this talented author sure knows how to keep the readers engaged. Come Sundown is another one of her captivating romantic suspense standalone that was fast paced and hard to put down. It all starts in 1991 with twenty one year old Alice Bodine making her way back home to the family ranch in Montana after having run away to California at eighteen. Due to some unfortunate turn of events Alice doesn't make it back and her family has no idea that she was returning home. The story then transitions into the present day life at the Bodine Ranch and Resort, and we are introduced to Bodine Langbow. Smart, strong and self-reliant, Bo runs the resort along with her younger brother Rory, while her parents and elder brother Chase manage the ranch. They are all living a peaceful, happy and busy life in the mountains managing the four generation old family business. Things start getting interesting when Bo's childhood crush and Chase's best friend, Callen Skinner returns back home after making a small fortune in Hollywood and starts working for the family. Soon after, two back to back murders take place in the otherwise peaceful town with no obvious suspect. Meanwhile, there are occasional flashbacks, unraveling the heartbreaking and painful incidents that occur in Alice's life, the abuse and torture that she is forced to endure in the clutches of a maniac and psychopath. With another turn of events and some luck Alice manages to escape her captor and returns back to her family after nearly three decades. But she is left a fragile and broken version of her former self, given to the years of suffering and torment. The two mysteries of figuring out the dangerous serial killer on loose in present day Bodine Ranch and the unwinding of Alice's dark twisted past along with the family dynamics of this close knit kin is what constitutes the major chunk of the story. Combined with excellent writing and lush descriptions of the beautiful Montana backdrop, Come Sundown is a satisfying read. Although, it falls under the category of romantic suspense, I felt it weighed more towards the suspense and familial ties with romance as just an added treat. It focuses heavily on the strong bonds of family and the trust and support for one's own. The characters are extremely well defined and seem like people one might know in real life, but then that is one of the many specialties of Nora Roberts. It does include considerable amount of darkness and graphic violence, but if you can get past the dark and gritty, Come Sundown is an engaging read with a fluid pace, excellent characterization and enjoyable writing with an absorbing mystery surrounding it."}, {"userName": "Taryn Pierson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn-pierson", "userReview": "Nora Roberts\u2019 books are like cookies made with Grandma\u2019s recipe: sweet, satisfying, and positively foolproof. There is no more surefire pick-me-up or slump buster. Her books sell like hotcakes because she knows how to give people what they want, and she somehow manages to crank out more than one a year. I guess it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s so good, with that much practice under her belt.Come Sundown is the perfect escapist read, set on a Montana ranch and resort owned by the kind of family you wish you were a part of. Multiple generations live and work on the grounds, and everybody has a role that fits their nature perfectly. They\u2019re joined by a handful of outsiders who quickly become like family as well. Sound like too much of a lovefest to be believable? Enter the second storyline: Aunt Alice left home years ago in a fit of teenage rebellion, but ends up being held captive by a kidnapping sadist just a few miles away from the family that alternately misses and resents her. The descriptions of Alice\u2019s captivity and her treatment at the hands of her tormentor are hard to read (trigger warning for sure), but I could deal with it because I knew Roberts wouldn\u2019t leave a girl hanging. That bastard would get what was coming to him, and I couldn\u2019t wait to see it happen. In the meantime, there are delightful, gentlemanly cowboys to swoon over, the tough but feminine gals they fall for, and one very talented horse who steals the show.This was my first time trying Nora Roberts in audio, and I highly recommend it, with one caveat: the family only has about three or four ideas as far as names for their children, and they just keep using those names over and over, generation after generation. Thus you get multiple characters (I counted at least three) named Rory, some characters for whom Bodine is a last name and another for whom it\u2019s a first name, etc. It\u2019s confusing, but if you focus up a little bit when each character is introduced, you\u2019ll be fine.As an aside, I never thought I\u2019d find a barfight sexy, but Nora Roberts knows there\u2019s something deeply attractive about righteous anger. Right on, girl.More book recommendations by me at www.readingwithhippos.com"}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3076351-kathryn", "userReview": "4.5 stars. All I can say is Nora Roberts does it again with Come Sundown. There is mystery and crime, strong women, a beautiful ranch and resort in Montana, family and friends, romance - all of which combine into making a downright good read.Bodine - the heroine is a strong, feisty woman and boss, she runs the resort side of the family business really well. She comes from a strong line of women - there's Miss Fancy her great grandmother of 89 years, Cora her grandmother and Maureen her mother. And don't think Miss Fancy sits all day in a rocking chair, don't offend her with that. She can still ride out when she wants over the ranch. One of the laughs I got from this book was a tee shirt she turned out in one time with a really apt and clever slogan on the front. Not going to spoil it for you though, you just need to come across it.There is darkness in this novel, Bodine's Aunt Alice went missing, she was a little of the black sheep of the family and had left home to do her thing. However she is taken hostage by a very bad guy and lost to the family. Bodine and her two brothers have never met her or seen her. At times we get the viewpoint of this evil, ugly man and for some that could be off putting. But so far one thing I can say is, Nora Roberts never lets the bad guy win - so hang in there.These dark spots are juxtaposed against family, life on the ranch and resort. Family bonds are so strong and when Callen rides in on his amazing horse life gets even better. He is a long time friend of Bodine's brother Chase, returning to his place of birth after time in Hollywood training horses. Soon he is very much involved in life on the ranch and resort. And dang it. That horse of his, there is something magical about it.I love the title of this book and how it relates to the story, won't give it away, but its perfect. At times during the reading I shied away from the ugly, caught my breath at the very emotional points and chuckled at some of the humour that sprang out in places."}, {"userName": "Anita", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10765339-anita", "userReview": "Advanced Reader Copy (ARC) provided by the Author, Nora Roberts and Publisher, St. Martin's Press, in exchange for an fair and honest review.I have always loved the romantic-suspense books by Nora Roberts and I don't expect anything but the best from \"Come Sundown\". With her new publisher, NR is finally getting the kind of treatment that the Queen of Romantic-Suspense deserves. St. Martin's Press is going all out to insure that this book has to best launch possible, something that was sadly lacking from her last publisher. This is not your usual NR romantic-suspense there are some very heavy Women's Fiction subjects in this one. If you are expecting a hot, torrid romance with edge of your seat suspense, this isn\u2019t that book. Come Sundown is a sweet romance and slow suspense makes for a low-key romantic-suspense. NR is a superb writer and she shows her chops with the slow building and merging of her story lines, her character development and how she can make you feel like you are right there in the place with her.The story begins with the abduction of Alice Bodine in 1991 as she makes her way home after running away from the Bodine Ranch in Montana three years before. What happens to her is the stuff of nightmares. Her story is told interspersed with what is happening currently at the Bodine Ranch and the Bodine Resort. The Bodine-Longbow family is wonderful, loving and strong. They have survived and thrived in the wide open spaces of Montana and built a world class ranch and resort. The whole family takes part in the operation, Bodine runs the resort, and her life, with military precision. Riding back into her life is Callen \u201cCal\u201dSkinner on his wonderful horse, Sundown. Bodine had her first teen crush on Cal. Now she is his boss.Bodine is a kick-a** heroine who doesn\u2019t suffer fools or Cal at all:\u201cWhen he walked out, Bodine snatched the coffee off the table, dumped it down the sink \u201cMale, dick-measuring, ball-swinging, chest-puffing bullshit.\u201d\u201dWhen Alice returns, 26 years after she disappeared, their carefully organized lives are thrown into disarray, but the family pulls together and everyone helps Alice heal and recover herself. But, now the family and Cal are thrust into situations that will endanger them, put them at risk and deepen the love they have for each other."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/672625-susan", "userReview": "Come SundownNora RobertsThank you so much to St. Martins Press for my ARC........It's been a long time since I read a Nora Roberts book. I have no excuses as to why, just too many books to read I suppose. Once I started COME SUNDOWN I was kicking myself for waiting so long to revisit one of my longtime favorite authors. COME SUNDOWN is a stand alone which is rare nowadays so no long term commitment! The story starts in 1991. Alice Bodine ran away to Hollywood a few years ago and after a few postcards, her family never heard from her again. That was twenty five years ago and her family doesn't really talk about her. It's too painful and too much for her Momma to talk about. But not a day goes by when her mom doesn't think about her.COME SUNDOWN is written outlining two different times in the Bodine family. The past and the present. Once I started reading, it was hard to put this heart pounding story down. Alice Bodine ran away from Montana in 1989 and three years later, she is making her way home. She never makes it because she takes a ride from a stranger and life as she knew it is now over. What she endures at the hands of this monster broke my heart over and over again. In the present day, you meet Bodine Longbow who runs the Bodine resort. She is always busy and always on the go, but always has time for her friends and employees. She had a child hood crush on Callen Skinner but that was years ago. He moved away years ago to go to California as well. Well, guess who is back at the ranch/resort? That's right, Callen! When two young women are found dead, his arch enemy from when he was a kid thinks right away that Cal is the suspect! Oh his accuser is also a deputy! Oh yeah, it doesn't get any better than that right? COME SUNDOWN is filled with love, patience, healing, and just the right amount of suspense. Without giving the whole story away, Alice comes back after 26 years and her family rallies around her to help her heal. You can't even begin to imagine all that she went through and wonder if her mind can ever begin to heal. Your heart will break over and over again for Alice and all that she dealt with from the man she called Sir. Hold on to your seats my reading friends........this is one hell of a wild ride!"}, {"userName": "sue", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377874-sue", "userReview": "I have read Nora Roberts books before and enjoyed them.

Making a decision between cutting across the wildness in the snow, or going the longer way round, Alice decided to stick to the road, which seemed like the safer option of the two. How wrong could Alice have been?Back in present-day Montana, Bodine Longbow (Alice\u2019s niece), is the manager of her family\u2019s, four-generation run holiday ranch. She is hard-working and has little time for herself. So when an ex-lover, Callum, comes back into her life, taking up work on the ranch, she decides she doesn\u2019t have time for a relationships.At the same time as Callum re-appears, women start being murdered. Is this just a coincidence or is Callum involved? Events take an even darker twist when Alice suddenly makes an appearance in a distressed state, 25 years after she disappeared.Firstly time for a confession. Although I have known about Nora Robert\u2019s work for a long time, this is the first book that I have read by her, and I can assure you, it won\u2019t be the last.This book is dark, sinister at times. There are some brutal scenes, and horrifying events, especially regarding Alice, who has been kept as a slave/baby-maker for the last 25 years, repeatedly battered, and raped by her captor.We as readers are taken back and forth between Alice\u2019s horrific world and present-day Montana. The characters, and there are quite a few of them, are all well thought out, and wonderfully-constructed. The family has such a strong bond between them, that it\u2019s hard not to like each and everyone of them.There are some lighter, more at ease scenes, including a few romances and fun events occurring between the family members, so it\u2019s not all heart-wrenching.I love a good book that absorbs me into the plot and hooks me to the page, gets my pulse racing, and my emotions in a tither. This book did all of those things.Ms. Roberts keeps us guessing as to what is going to happen next.

I won an Advance Reader's Edition of this book from the publisher through a Goodreads giveaway. Thank you to both.I have to be honest, this one took me a while to get into the story. I found the present day storyline a little plodding and the story that initially kept me reading were the small bits of flashbacks to Alice and what happens to her in the past. But, somewhere along the way, I got pulled into the entire saga of this family and each character's storyline, whether a large part or small. I think that was what threw me off in the beginning: you're introduced to a lot of characters in a short amount of time and it took me a bit to warm up to them. I felt the glimpses into the past were handled well and did not take away from the overall flow of the story. Honestly, the parts with Alice (past and present) I found to be much more interesting than any of the \"romances\" taking place in the book. My heart just broke for her at so many moments in the story.Overall this was a good, solid read, but at 468 pages it lost some suspense along the way, and there were a few times I found my mind wandering.

The Bodine Ranch Resort in Montana was large working rural restore run by the Bodine Family and managed by Bodine Longbow Granddaughter of the original owners.

However, when bodies began to turn up on the resort grounds, Callen and Bodine were reunited again to find the truth before more people die. The readers of Come Sundown will follow Bodine's and Callen investigation into the death of the young girls and start to wonder if they will fall in love. I enjoyed reading Come Sundown. I like authors who can entwine two plots and combine them at the end of the book. I do not know how Nora Roberts comes up with her plots and provides her readers with so many fantastic stories without using co-writer. The love the beautiful Sundown and the way Nora Roberts portrayed him. I also like Nora Roberts writing style and the way she describes her plots and adding a twist that the readers of Come Sundown never knew was coming. Nora Roberts knows how to keep her readers engaged with the story with the fantastic portrayals of her characters. Readers of Come Sundown will learn about running a large rural resort in Montana. Also, the consequences of family violence on everyone involved. Reading Come Sundown started me thinking that you should not always take things at face value. Readers of Come Sundown will learn about running a large rural resort and the problems that curtail. \"Come Sundown\" also highlights the importance of horses in helping people to heal from trauma.

O_OIt was truly chilling to read that part and I wished often for that man to suffer something equally painful and awful!!! Unfortunately he got it easy!!! So not fair!!!There're several love stories going on very, very slowly, but sweetly all the same.There's just a tiny, teeny bit that I was doubious about: the family/friendship dinamics very unbelievably perfect! Everybody would wish for that kind of family! While, in real life there's a lot of bickering, angry discussions, etc....

Nora Roberts has been such a prolific writer for such a long time, and as Come Sundown proves, her ability to captivate an audience is still as strong as ever. Further enhancing the entertainment value of this audiobook is the talented narration by Elisabeth Rodgers which really helped bring the story to life.Spanning numerous decades, Come Sundown is truly a family saga that tells the story of several people spanning three generations in the lives of a family that owns a ranch in western Montana. Over the years, the Bodine ranch was expanded to also include a resort. Although there are many characters in the book, the two primary female characters are Alice and Bodine. Alice is Bodine\u2019s Aunt, though they have never met. You see, Alice disappeared in the early 1990s shortly after Bodine\u2019s mother and father were wed. As Alice had been a lively and strong-willed teenager, the family assumes she ran away and chose never to return. If only the truth were that simple for Alice\u2019s sake.Meanwhile a second storyline takes place in the present with Bodine being the boss in charge of the ranch\u2019s resort. Bodine is also strong-willed but she has channeled that energy into furthering the economic well-being of her family. As a consequence, though, Bodine has little time for romantic endeavors. Well at least she did, until Callen Skinner, her brother\u2019s friend and her former crush returns home after sowing his oats and trying his fortunes in Hollywood as a trainer of horses that appeared in movies. Only problem is that Callen is now an employee of Bodine ranch. Is it ever a smart idea for an employer and employee to date?Further complicating matters is the fact that Callen\u2019s return coincides with two unexplained murders of young women. Could Callen possibly be involved? As secrets of the past are slowly revealed, you will soon find that the past is intricately connected to the present.See the full review at AudioGals."}, {"userName": "Olivia \"Don't Blame Me I Voted for Hillary\"", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19262650-olivia-don-t-blame-me-i-voted-for-hillary", "userReview": "Good story about two main women--one, Alice, is abducted by an evil man who frequently beats and rapes her.
