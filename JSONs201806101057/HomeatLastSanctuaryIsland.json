This is Marcus and Quinn\u2019s book and I was eagerly looking forward to reading their story.Unfortunately, the story the author delivered fell way short of the expectations I had, especially after the way this couple were with each other in the previous book from the series Close to Home, it was made very clear that Marcus is a man with a number of personal demons that he wasn\u2019t really dealing with, and Quinn was the woman that helped calm, stormy waters. So to have everything that was implied in the small amount you see of them in the previous book almost brushed under the carpet in this one left me really disappointed.\"Face it. You\u2019re in a pickle.\"The other thing that really bugs me is when an author gives you a secondary character in a book, and you get to know them, then when they get their own book, completely acts out of the character that you have already got a general impression of. That was 100% the case with this one, and the things Marcus agreed to in an effort to help Quinn out with her family issues were totally out of character for the guy I had previously got to know.\"I may be an optimistic idiot when it comes to romance, but even I have my limits\u2026!And that is where we hit the motherlode of my issues, the whole ridiculous situation with Quinn\u2019s parents, and Dastardly Doctor Ron, the marriage guru/con-man. It was beyond ridiculous, and took what could have been a sweet, poignant second chance romance between her and Marcus, and turned it into a bit of a farce. \"What a mess.\"I\u2019ll be honest, I had high expectations for this book, the author gave me them and they were built on the couple and their budding relationship that she teased me with in the previous book, so to take that story-line make it secondary, and to put everything Quinn\u2019s flaky mother, and spineless father were bumbling through in the forefront felt like a huge let-down to the story that this couple could have had if the author had kept the focus on them. The parts when they were together (and there weren\u2019t a huge amount, sadly) took me to the place I wanted to be with them, but it just kept being overshadowed by the unnecessary familial drama between her parents.\"You\u2019re my hero\u2026\"\"I\u2019m nobody\u2019s hero.\"\"If you want me to buy that\u2026 You\u2019re going to have to stop being there for me when I need you the most.\"I love visiting Sanctuary Island, and my disappointment on this occasion won\u2019t stop me visiting again in the future, I just wish the author had stayed true to the couple that deserved to have the focus on them and their story in this one, rather than being put on the back burner for what quite frankly was a ridiculous and childish level of unnecessary drama.

Two people grow up together, neighbors, but when life bears down on Marcus, he leaves for parts unknown, leaving Quinn behind with her quirky style and crush on him. Their brief fling was only enough to hurt Marcus\u2019s rep around town and Quinn has an offer he cannot believe to help him out. Should her take her crazy challenge? Can he take being so close to her for one whole month? He is everything she doesn\u2019t need, but he is also everything she wants. Life has brought Marcus back home and he is trying to re-plant the roots he tore out. Meanwhile, Quinn is caught up in a major family crisis that her mother believes a couples guru can fix. Think Snake Oil Salesmen, here. Is it possible her parents will sell the only home she has ever known because of its negative vibes? Has their marriage really devolved into something so hollow that even this guru sounds believable? Acting out being a couple in love is torturous for both of them, but could it be a rehearsal for the real thing? Right now, it is the best idea Quinn could come up with to stop her parents from making a huge mistake! (While getting her Marcus fix, along the way)This time out, Lily Everett has splashed a large dash of humor, fun, and some farfetched marital tips that may have sinister designs underneath.

I was anxious for Marcus and Quinn\u2019s story since getting to know them and their undeniable attraction in book five, \nCLOSE TO HOME\n. Sanctuary Island latches onto your heart and you can\u2019t wait to come back to this quirky island of healing. There are always surprises and this one has some doozies.Marcus Beckett harbors secrets and is a hard man to love. He has been broken by love, and he has no desire to repeat it. Marcus believes he\u2019s unlovable, and for most of this novel, I believed him. He pushes Quinn away at every turn. Little by little his true nature reveals itself, and when he comes clean in the end, it\u2019s beautiful.Quinn Harper is the quirkier of the pair. She\u2019s a free spirit who reflects her mother more than she realizes it. This story is as much about Quinn\u2019s parents\u2019 failing marriage as it is about her pretend engagement to Marcus. It\u2019s because of Quinn\u2019s parents\u2019 possible divorce that Marcus gets roped into becoming Quinn\u2019s pretend fianc\u00e9.When both couples must live together and are forced to work with a ridiculous, conniving marriage guru, life gets interesting, volatile, and explosive. I began to believe that none of them would end up in a happily-ever-after relationship. The slime-ball marriage guru is very good at creating havoc for his own gain. He\u2019s the creepy villain you\u2019ll love to hate.Primarily a relationship novel, it\u2019s not riddled with suspense or multiple subplots to keep the story moving forward. That\u2019s probably why I had a much harder time staying connected to this story during a time of distractions in my own life. It\u2019s a much slower pace than previous books, but it still packs a punch.This novel is essentially a comfort read with quirky characters who aren\u2019t always easy to love. As always, author Lily Everett pulls out the emotion that choked me up. Ms. Everett is gifted at creating rare characters with numerous flaws, who you can\u2019t resist loving in the end. I cried like a baby over some of the circumstances. Once the emotional roller coaster gets rolling down the hill, it\u2019s a wild ride to the end.HOME AT LAST closed too quickly, leaving me wanting more, but it was extremely effective in reminding me why I love this author\u2019s style. Start at the beginning with \nSANCTUARY ISLAND\n and continue through the series. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy them as much as I have.Review by Dorine, courtesy of Romance Junkies.

I really liked them and could not wait to read their story. After finishing this book, their story is even better than I hoped. I recently finished another book where the male lead had a nickname for the female lead. Marcus has one for Quinn as well. It is \"Turbo\". Knowing the meaning behind it makes it all that more enduring. Despite a 10 year age difference, it was not felt as Quinn and Marcus interacted with each other. In fact, I think it actually helped their relationship as Quinn was so much wiser beyond her young age. There was so many emotions captured in their relationship. Which I connected with them both as people and as a couple. Plus, their story showed that there is more to love than just sex. While, this book was focused mainly on Quinn and Marcus; the other characters did not just sit by and play second string. Additionally, they had strong presence in this story as well and I enjoyed every one of them. I felt like I had come home with this book.

On the other hand Quinn the island darling proposes a way to make things right for him and maybe provide some distraction for herself at the same time. This was a fake relationship with the potential for making both their worlds right again but for different reasons. The both were escaping something in their lives and together they found a chance to really turn off the outside world and explore what lay ahead of them together. This was a beautiful second chance romance that was better the second time around. They had time to grow with one another. Learn about each other. And ultimately find that they had more in common than either one of them would have dreamed of. Warm, caring, beautiful and opening. The characters put you right at home on the island. There are always more sides to the situation than the one presented. Sanctuary Island has yet another side of its beauty revealed with the story of Quinn and Marcus.

Quinn and Marcus were amusing with their old married couple bickering but in this book you really don't see much of that in this book. The romance between them seemed very easy, I thought the main focus of the book was more on Quinn's parents their problem and her dealing with them. Marcus also dealing with his past and the baggage he carries. Quinn and Marcus had a steamy relationship until Marcus' and all his guilt and drama got the better of him and he ended things with Quinn. A little later Quinn's parents come back to town after traveling and staying at home with them would drive her crazy, so she kind of pushes Marcus into letting her stay in the other apartment above Buttercup Inn. Quinn's parents are on the verge of divorce and according to Quinn it's not possible, there have never been two people more in love than her parents. On their travels her parents met a relationship guru who has them doubting their marriage and telling them they need to sell their house. Quinn thinks that if she is in a steady relationship then her parents can stop worrying about her and they won't sell their house. Quinn makes deal with Marcus and he agrees. To make matters worse Quinn's mom invited the guru to stay with them and his schemes have all five of them staying at Quinn's childhood home, which is right next door to Marcus' childhood home; a home he has not returned to since the death of his mother. Quinn and Marcus know there's something fishy going on with the guru and Marcus and Quinn dig into his background to discover the truth. Quinn and Marcus' relationship shifts from fake to real but can it survive the insecurity they both feel when it comes to committing. Overall, I liked the characters and how they dealt with their problems how everything was resolved but the story all in all just didn't do it for me."}, {"userName": "Jenny - Book Sojourner", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6992157-jenny---book-sojourner", "userReview": "3.5 StarsI was excited to get the rest of Marcus and Quinn's story, which was introduced in the previous book, 'Close to Home.' I was looking forward to their second chance romance, and finding out all the ways they ticked. Marcus was an especially difficult character to read. When he put up walls, he really went all out. Good thing Quinn is an optimistic, positive person - Marcus's opposite - otherwise, there's no way they would have had a second chance. She was just the sunshine needed to help this relationship grow.Now this story went in a direction I wasn't expecting, with the introduction of Quinn's parents and their marital problems, and their suspicious marriage guru. With Quinn's approach to helping her parents, and the way she obtained Marcus's help in the situation, I found these side-by-side stories quite interesting and intriguing. Though, truth be told, I wanted to shake sense into both couples after a while. There was a bit more back-and-forth, circling-the-same-issue repetition than I would have liked. But I also liked how so many issues were dealt with and resolved, or resolved-for-now, by the end.Overall, I enjoyed this sweet romance. Marcus and Quinn, once they got out of their own way, were really a great couple, bringing their strengths into their relationship to help each other, and their personalities balanced out the differences in their approach on life. They became not only a beautiful, loving couple, but also created a wonderful partnership.'Home at Last' is the sixth book in the Sanctuary Island series, but is really only a continuation of book five, 'Close to Home,' where Quinn and Marcus were introduced, though they were just side characters in that book.

Quinn Harper is a vibrant and likeable character who has loved Marcus since she was a child, even though he carelessly tossed her to one side after their brief relationship when he returned to the island. Now her parents are back home but they are struggling with their own relationship and Quinn will do anything to stop them from making some rash decisions like selling her childhood home or get a divorce - even make up a fictitious boyfriend. Now all she needs to do is convince Marcus to play the part...Marcus Beckett is back on Sanctuary Island hoping to make a life for himself with his new bar. But having hurt Quinn, the whole island is avoiding him and his new Inn. When Quinn informs him of her plan to save her family, while at the same time restoring his chances at making his business a success, he foolishly agrees. But as Marcus and Quinn spend more time together, it becomes harder to control the incredible heat between them. But Marcus has shut his heart off from love, as he has always lost those that mattered most, and he believes that Quinn is better off without him.Throw in a relationship guru with an ulterior motive, some standing stones, and an old relationship that needs to be confronted, and HOME AT LAST by Lily Everett is a story that will melt your heart and make you swoon in all the right places.

Marcus and Quinn had began a relationship in the previous book of this series which had ended in a humiliating breakup for Quinn. Wanting desperately to save her parents marriage, Quinn begged Marcus to go along with her scheme and even though Marcus was reluctant he couldn\u2019t deny that he really did want Quinn as much as she wanted him.The pacing was done very well and this was an easy read. The growth Marcus maintained after he finally opened up about his past and came to terms with his aversion of his father made it easier to be honest with Quinn.

When talk of their marriage ending in divorce turns to selling their home and property on the secluded Lantern Point of Sanctuary Island Quinn knows she must take action. When Quinn was 12 years old she had a crush on their only neighbor\u2019s son, Marcus, ten years her senior. After high school she had a brief fling with Marcus before he left to enlist in the Army, followed by (unknown to her) a stint in the Secret Service. His tour with the Secret Service has left deep scars on his soul that he refuses to talk about.Marcus is home again, running the only bar in town, which is failing due to a lack of customers. Quinn knows why and only she can fix it. The small population on the island blames Marcus for breaking Quinn\u2019s heart, for she is the town darling.Quinn believes that she can save her parent\u2019s marriage by pretending to have a romantic relationship with Marcus. She convinces him to go along with her scheme by telling him she can bring customers to his bar by making the townspeople believe she has forgiven him for leaving her when he joined the army.

But she is not the only one, everyone on the island is boycotting the bar, because of how he behaved with Quinn.But when Quinn comes up with a plan, not only to save his bar, but save her parents marriage, Marcus is powerless to resist; but will it all end in disaster?So I'm thrilled to be reading my second Sanctuary Island book, and I should really go back and restart the series, but I have to say that you could totally do what I have done and pick up any of them, as they are stand alone books.I was thrilled to see Miss Patty back in this book (she really is my favorite charater), and I also loved Marcus and Quinn's characters, in seperate ways. I liked Quinn's sweet nature and Marcus's gruff exterior, but slightly softer heart.The author has managed to spellbound me with her beautiful writing and enchanting storyline; Lily Everett has quickly become one of my favorite authors of 2017!I give Home At Last 5 well deserved stars!"}, {"userName": "Danielle Urban", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29092975-danielle-urban", "userReview": "Home at Last by Lily Everett is a fascinating tale. The emotional journey inside is what really stands out to me. A young man's pain. A past that has held him hostage even now. Then, there's one woman who makes him want more in life. But he's too sacred. Life is complicated, messy, and hard. He wants her to have the best. But what he doesn't know is that he's not only pushing her away forever but the town people as well. They love her. In their eyes, he's the bad guy. Unless he changes...Home at Last is beautifully written. Engaging, sweet, and knocks readers off their chairs into the to story. Never a dull moment. The intensity is shocking but good. I can feel the characters emotions coming off the pages. Their chemistry is there. But one chooses to ignore it. That only sends them both down a lonely miserable road. Unless fate intervenes...both will be unhappy. Lily Everett has once more sent me on an unforgettable journey. A chance for love. Second chances. A happily ever after is in the air. Only time will tell, if it will happen. I loved characters. A broken man and a strong hearted woman. The plot is exciting. The other characters only add to it. Highly entertaining and suspenseful. When they do open up...readers will fall deeeply in love with this book as much as I did. I can't get enough of Lily Everett's novels. She has talent in creating the perfect worlds where her characters feel so real.

Their \u201con again-off again\u201d romance made me hope for a happily ever after. I knew they were meant to be, but stubborn heads and sad pasts get in the way.\n\u00a0\nMarcus and Quinn were the types of characters that made me want to slap them each up side the head. And, I say that with the utmost of love and affection.\n\n \nI describe it as a sort of \u201cgrrr\u201d romance. I grrrd a lot while reading this just because I felt for each character and all they had to do--or should I say Marcus had to do was confide in Quinn. I guess he didn\u2019t trust her enough to do that. We were introduced to these two in the previous book. I wasn\u2019t sure what to think about them, especially Quinn, who practically jumped Marcus\u2019 bones. In this book, their relationship isn\u2019t so shallow.Marcus was the problem.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe world is full of people who think they know what\u2019s best for you and \u2018love\u2019 gives them the right to decide that. You\u2019re better off making your own choices.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0UGH--Marcus, you\u2019re a sexy character but totally depressing. I get it, it\u2019s your thing, you have a past. He needs the brightness that is Quinn to balance his character. I realized that after I finished reading this. His character did grow, with Quinn\u2019s help. He realizes it somehow during the course of the story.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis-all of this, being close to you. It\u2019s not easy for me. But I want it. I\u2019m trying.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe love is slow growing, the insta-attraction was on fire!\n\u00a0There are also elements of sweetness, and this story focused a lot on family structure. Quinn\u2019s parents also suffer a little hiccup in their relationship and I didn\u2019t think it was necessary to know Paul\u2019s (Qunn\u2019s father) POV. But it was still a nice read, a little different than the previous story. I did enjoy the fake boyfriend trope though. It always adds an extra bit of drama."}, {"userName": "Gaele", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9146116-gaele", "userReview": "We first met Marcus and Quinn in the previous book, Close to Home, and the two finally got together after years of Quinn following Marcus about in a sort of hero worship daze for years. Now they get their story, and I had great hopes for something wonderful. Marcus is a hometown boy who left after his mother\u2019s death and made a career as a bodyguard. He\u2019s decided he doesn\u2019t want that stress, so he\u2019s back home to run a bar and avoid Quinn at all costs. From finding her a pesky little girl, to letting his guard down and acting on the attraction he now feels, he knows that he isn\u2019t the one for Quinn, no matter how much he may want to be. Even if she does accept him unconditionally, and life always looks brighter with her around. For her part, Quinn is the \u2018girl from town\u2019 a bit flighty, not known for her ability to stick with things, but she is the town\u2019s Little Girl. EVERYONE watches out for her \u2013 and when she is totally serious about Marcus and making him see her as all grown up and worth taking a chance on, she doesn\u2019t seem to be able to get anyone to believe her. When you add in her parents\u2019 marriage difficulties, and the potential of a \u2018fake engagement\u2019 playing in to help Quinn get what she wants (Marcus) it seems as if things are ready to roll forward. And this is where I had problems: Marcus very much showed us that he has lots of issues that he hasn\u2019t come face to face with, yet totally out of character he agrees. And Quinn \u2013 well, from the ridiculous \u201cmarriage counselor\u2019 that her parents were consulting (think a cross between a lounge lizard and the worst Yahoo answers advice ever) the whole opportunity for the \u2018tension\u2019 was lost in caricature. I was disappointed as there was such a wonderful introduction for these two in the earlier book, and the full story fell short. It\u2019s sad, for Everett\u2019s writing is always wonderful, and the characters are well-built, if completely opposite from expectations, and this does fit into the Sanctuary Island series trajectory, I just wanted more.

They were definitely my favorite thing about that book because their relationship had a ton of spark and combustion. At the end of that book they weren't together and I couldn't wait to see which direction this book would take them. I was so pleasantly surprised with what the author did in this book. HOME AT LAST is possibly my favorite book in this series, and that may just be because it has a bit more romance than women's fiction than we've seen in the previous books in the series. That being said, I think you could read this one without having read the previous books. Quinn was the girl next door, many years younger than Marcus. Her childhood crush turned into very adult attraction when Marcus comes back to town. A bit broken by what his life has made him go through. He comes with a very surly and grumpy attitude, which I weirdly found endearing. Quinn's young spunk is just what he needs to feel re-invigorated about life. She pushes him to be happy and doesn't take no for an answer. I loved that about her character. At the same time she's dealing with figuring out the direction of her life and career and her parents possibly divorcing.I was expecting something a little darker in Marcus's past to justify some of his thoughts and actions, but it was all a bit simple in my opinion. That was one place I thought this story could go a little deeper, but it goes well with the easier feel of the book and series.You also get a side story, not really calling it a secondary romance, but dealing with Quinn's parents trying to save their marriage or going for divorce. This was also woven nicely in with the main romance and felt relevant to the story so it was a nice addition.HOME AT LAST has small town charm and was a fast read. I believe this is the last book in the series, but I'll be sure to be on the lookout for more books by Lily Everett. There's a comfortable warmth to the stories she tells under this pen name and if you like your romance a bit sweeter than this will definitely be a good series to read.*ARC provided by publisherReviewed by Francesca\u2764 \u2661 Don't want to miss any of our posts?

There\u2019s a fake engagement, second chances at love and family ties, a scam artist, and of course all the wonderful personalities that make up this tight-knit town.Although this was Marcus and Quinn\u2019s story, Quinn\u2019s parents played a big role in everything that goes down \u2013 especially when Quinn finds out that she may be one of the contributing factors to her parents\u2019 marriage problems. Asking Marcus to pretend to be her boyfriend seems like the best plan of attack to show her parents that she is settling down\u2026but when Marcus suddenly announces they are engaged and then Quinn\u2019s parents want them to move in with them for a couple weeks for some serious marriage/family counseling, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the act become more real than show. Marcus and Quinn were seriously hot together. You could always feel the underlying sparks that would fly every time these two would even so much as think about each other. It was fun watching them both try to keep their arrangement in the friend zone \u2013 especially when they had to share Quinn\u2019s old room.Then she wondered what the hell was the matter with her. It was a bed. They were adults. Sleeping next to each other didn\u2019t mean they were automatically going to cross some invisible, arbitrary line. She wasn\u2019t going to roll over in her sleep and accidentally impale herself on his penis. They\u2019d be fine.But of course those sparks made it near impossible for them to keep their hands off each other \u2013 especially when they had to share a bed.Quinn, who\u2019d twitched at the sound of her mother\u2019s voice, dropped her hands from Marcus\u2019s neck to throw an arm over her eyes and hide her red face. \u201cComing, Mother.\u201dSome devil prompted Marcus to lean down and whisper, \u201cWe could be, if she\u2019d waited five minutes.\u201dQuinn convulsed in shocked giggles under him, which made Marcus grin instead of grimacing while trying to smoothly remove his hand from her underwear. His dick, like most dicks, had no sense of time or place for the inherent unsexiness of nearly getting caught in the act by his girlfriend\u2019s mom like a couple of teenagers.No, his dick still thought the original morning plan was A-OK, ready for action, go go go. But Marcus was in charge, so instead of following orders from below the belt, he swung off Quinn.There were several other subplots going on that were nicely woven into Marcus and Quinn\u2019s story and helped set the stage for their shot at a second chance, the two biggest being Quinn\u2019s parent\u2019s marriage problems and Marcus\u2019s estrangement from his father.Quinn\u2019s parents were struggling to find a new normal now that her dad had retired. Their marriage was hitting some serious bumps and the marriage counselor they have brought in may have more than counseling on his agenda \u2013 and he has sucked Marcus and Quinn into his counseling drama. Watching Quinn\u2019s parents struggle was heart-breaking at times and I found myself rooting for them to get their happy ever after as well. You could just feel the love pouring off of her dad and the frustration coming from her mom, and it was so hard to see them both so hurt.Marcus also has some issues from his past he needs to deal with, namely settling things between himself and his father, a man he hasn\u2019t spoken to since he left home after his mother died. He\u2019s always blamed his dad for not letting him know sooner that his mother was closet to dying, which denied him the chance to come home to say goodbye before she passed. And when Quinn goes to visit Marcus\u2019s dad and we find out there is something important that Marcus needs to know but he\u2019s too bull-headed to go see the man and find out, I couldn\u2019t help but keep hoping that Marcus would man-up and at least see his father and maybe start the healing process.One of the things I really liked was that when Marcus and Quinn realized that their attraction may have run deeper than the physical, they both agreed to try and see where a relationship may lead \u2013 not a lot of angst and drama around it, they both just came to the same conclusion and decided to see where things went. And with the drama surrounding Quinn\u2019s parents, it was nice not to have to deal with too much drama between these two.Once again I was captivated by all the happenings on Sanctuary Island. The townspeople all play a part in adding color and personality to these books, and as I\u2019ve said before, I think this is a place I\u2019d really like to find on the map. Even though this is a series I think you can easily read this one as a stand-alone. Marcus and Quinn show up in the previous book, but I don\u2019t think their story loses anything if you start here. I would definitely recommend this book and series as one to tryI received an advance reader copy from the publisher via NetGalley which I voluntarily reviewed."}, {"userName": "Angel Hatfield", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1892441-angel-hatfield", "userReview": "Marcus came back to Sanctuary Island and now owned the bar The Buttercup Inn.

When Marcus came home the first thing he did was sleep with Quinn the literal girl next store and ten years younger than him. Marcus had let Quinn move upstairs. Every time Marcus was in the same room as Quinn her sunshine smile and cute freckles made him itch to touch her. Quinn stopped to Marcus. Quinn said she could get the townspeople to come into the bar and stop boycotting it all Marcus had to do was pretend to be Quinn\u2019s boyfriend for the next four weeks as her parents seem to be fighting over her and this would show them she had a job and a serious boyfriend. But in a month would be their thirtieth wedding anniversary if Quinn couldn\u2019t get them to renew their vows inside a month she would let them go and get a divorce if that was what they wanted. Quinn told Marcus not to worry she knew they weren\u2019t really back together but the town knew they had been together and would verify it to her parents. It wouldn\u2019t be much according to Quinn a couple of dinners maybe a picnic or something. Just enough to make her parents believe they were in love. Then Marcus agreed to it. Marcus told Quinn he needed her to promise not to get caught up in the act. Quinn had a moment of doubt about her ability to get through the next four weeks with her heart and sanity intact. Marcus hated how Quinn's Parents hurt her without meaning to. Then Marcus proposed to Quinn as all Marcus could think about was protecting Quinn from pain. Quinn\u2019s mother Ingrid had a marriage Guru Ron and he came to Sanctuary island from N. Mexico to supposedly help Quinn\u2019s parents fix their marriage. Then Ingrid invited Quinn and Marcus to also stay with them as well as Ron. Marcus gave in and said he would stay the two weeks with her parents as that is how long Ron would be there.I liked this story a lot. It had a good plot and well written. I liked how Marcus tried to put Quinn first even if she didn\u2019t see it that way. I liked Quinn as a person she was really a sweet person and she definitely loved Marcus no doubt about that. I felt bad that Marcus had lost people he loved and he felt guilt for Buttercup\u2019s death. I was glad when he finally talked to his dad.

Heartwarming, believable and captivating from start to finish, Home at Last is a poignant and passionate read you will not easily forget!Marcus Beckett had left the small town of Sanctuary Island after his mother\u2019s funeral for the bright city lights where he had found employment as a bodyguard. However, the stress and danger of his job had soon got to him and Marcus had decided that there really was no place like home, so he had packed his bags and headed back to his home town and started running the neighbourhood bar. Life for Marcus was a pretty lonely and desolate one \u2013 until he clapped eyes on Quinn Harper, Sanctuary Island\u2019s sweetheart and the town\u2019s golden girl. Mutual desire had quickly given way to a passion that simply couldn\u2019t be denied. But despite the fact that Quinn had unearthed feelings deep in Marcus which he had never felt before, he knew that their relationship did not have any hope of surviving, so he decided that the only choice he had was to dump Quinn and to go back to his solitary existence. But little did Marcus realise that his decision to end things with Quinn was going to incur the wrath of the town\u2019s residents and with his best customers now refusing to cross his threshold, he realises that he\u2019s got to come up with a plan \u2013 or else risk losing not just his livelihood, but the peaceful life which he treasures so much. Luckily for him, kind-hearted Quinn has come up with the perfect solution to put a stop to all of his troubles: a fake four-week relationship!Distraction is something Quinn is desperately in need of. She needs to keep her mind off her parents\u2019 marital troubles and if her neighbours desist from this ridiculous grudge against Marcus and go back to drinking in his bar, so much the better. But Quinn hadn\u2019t counted on their convenient arrangement leading to something far deeper \u2013 something that will not just ignite the spark of desire that sizzles between them, but will also heal both of their hearts.Will Quinn and Marcus\u2019 fake engagement become the real thing? Or are there too many obstacles standing in the way of their happy ever after?There is magic on every page of Lily Everett\u2019s Home at Last. Romantic, emotional, dramatic and simply spellbinding from beginning to end, Lily Everett aims straight for the heart and does not miss with this beguiling and enthralling tale that I just couldn\u2019t bear to put down. Humour, sensuality, passion and emotion are deftly intertwined in this unforgettable romantic read and readers are sure to fall in love with brooding Marcus and spirited Quinn.Captivating, thrilling and emotional from start to finish, if you\u2019re looking for the contemporary romance of the year, then look no further than Lily Everett\u2019s Home at Last!"}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21034469-kristi", "userReview": "I was really hoping I would enjoy this book more than the previous one in the series. Quinn and Marcus were introduced in that book and I was actually more interested in them than the main characters. I was not disappointed. Home at Last delivered and was everything I hoped it would be.Quinn and Marcus had an interesting relationship and I liked getting the backstory of Marcus leaving Sanctuary Island. For me, this really added to the story and made me feel like I knew the characters and had a better understanding of them. Quinn's character is light and airy as opposed to Marcus being so uptight and serious. The two characters balanced each other well. I really enjoyed Quinn's parents and smiled at their hippy-ish ways. Reading their storyline made it easier to understand Quinn and her personality. I really enjoyed the storylines of this book. Not only does the reader get to explore the relationship between Quinn and Marcus but there is also a storyline about Quinn's parents that ties in perfectly to the story. There were a few twists and turns when it came to Marcus and his father and this made the story really interesting. The pace of the book was great and I liked how the characters grew throughout the book. They all have flaws to some degree but they were willing to take the time to explore them and learn from them. Nothing in the book felt rushed or out of place. I found the story and characters to be well developed and the telling of the story was fantastic. This book was steamier than the previous book in the series. The \"steamy scenes\" were tastefully written though and not an issue for me. There were some words that may be offensive to some readers but for me it was all a non-issue.I would recommend this book to others. It is a quick and easy read.I was provided a free copy of this book from the publisher. I was not required to write a positive review.
