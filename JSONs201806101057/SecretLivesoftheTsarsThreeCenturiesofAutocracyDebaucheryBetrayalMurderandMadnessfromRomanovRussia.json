Then I end up looking up the various side relations (cousins, brothers, sisters, Grand Dukes) and, hours later, can't remember which Tsar I had started with, so I start the process all over again. This book is very handy and provides the Wiki team with some relief from my \"so which Tsar was the one who was killed\" (quite a few).The book focuses on the Romanov family, first beginning with the explanation for the end of the previous Rurik dynasty (which deserves its own book). Combining the intrigue of the Byzantine residue and the Slavic/Viking heritage, these are some real whoppers. Yes, there's Peter the Great and Catherine the Great and Alexander I and Alexander III. But really, the rest were just whacked out of their heads. I mean, really. Each leader gets a chapter and one wonders just how \"royal\" some were, given the extra-marital births that took place. Still, the sad end result of them all was Nicholas II. His ending was horrible and I had to hurry through to the finish so I wouldn't think too much about it. Learned quite a bit. I always got confused with the 19th Century group, so this was very helpful. Interesting to learn just how German they were (which might explain a few traits). This is not a long in-depth tome about Russian leaders, but it certainly hit the spot and kept me away from the world of Wiki for a bit, so bravo.Book Season - Summer (no tears, no questions)"}, {"userName": "Caidyn (BW Book Reviews; he/him/his)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-bw-book-reviews-he-him-his", "userReview": "3.5Surprisingly enjoyable. I went in here for trash on the tsars, and it wasn't as trashy as I expected. Actually, it was highly interesting because I know next to nothing about the Romanov dynasty. I thought it was sort of like Japan's, where there literally had been only one line of people from start to finish. However, apparently that's not right and so right from the first chapter I learned something I didn't know.The things before Catherine the Great (and Empress Elisabeth's family in general) and after her were the most interesting for me. Since I just finished listening to a 600+ page book about her, sort of know about the people slightly before her -- Elisabeth's father and him marrying a commoner; the struggle for Elisabeth to get the throne -- and then, most specifically, Catherine's son.Of course, I know so much about the Romanovs, but their story doesn't bore me like some of the other rulers. I suspect that's because of what happened to them, but oh well. Rasputin is so interesting. Nicholas and how he never wanted to be tsar. His relationship with his wife. His wife in general. The children. Seriously, they're so interesting, and I really learned a lot more about Nicholas and Alexandra the most from this book. Most of what I've read on the last Romanovs is focused on their children, so seeing about the same information presented at a new angle was very refreshing.All in all, if you're a newbie to Russian history like I am, this is a good book to go for it. The title is a bit misleading. It touches on the different things that happened, but nothing too much."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-chris", "userReview": "Disclaimer: ARC read via Netgalley in exchange for a fair review.\tPerhaps it is unfair to read this book after reading Elephant Company, which was the type of book that made me want to go find everything else by the author. This isn\u2019t the first Farquhar book I\u2019ve read, and last year I read Hughes book about the Romanovs. \tBut it\u2019s Farquhar. Even when he writes about things you know like the back of your hand, he is hilarious. It\u2019s a joy to spend a few hours reading one of his books. He\u2019s like the professor whose classes are always filled from day one.\tIn this slim volume about the Russian Romanov Tsar, Farquhar shows that the same wit and vibe he brought to American history, and scandals in royal houses, is aptly suited for vodka drinking Tsars. Even if you have read Hughes\u2019 excellent work that covers the same material, Farquhar\u2019s book will include little tidbits that are just completely strange and historically unimportant, but great to know. Like in the footnotes of Terry Pratchett, the footnotes of Farquhar are ones that no reader should miss. Some of his best bits are there \u2013 like the bit about cross dressing success (this was not in Hughes, though she is a source).\tPerhaps the weakest part of the book, and weakest isn\u2019t quite the world, are the three chapters that focus on the most famous Romanovs of all \u2013 Nicholas, Alexandra and their children. While it is understandable to include a more detailed look at the end of the rulers, it does feel a little bit dragged out \u2013 except for the part detailing Alexandra\u2019s character. The in depth look at Alexandra\u2019s actions and behavior, outside of her understandable desire to save her son, were particularly well done and strengthen what would have been a too drawn out look.\tFurthermore, considering recent events concerning Russia and the Ukraine, there are few choice bits in this book that will shed more light or understanding on the Crimea events. Good timing on Farquhar\u2019s part and it makes it a worthwhile read.\tAs always, there is a nice list of further reading and source works. If you haven\u2019t read anything about the Romanovs before, this book is an excellent introduction.Crossposted at Booklikes"}, {"userName": "Jolene", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4914094-jolene", "userReview": "3.5 Stars**Thank you to Random House and Netgalley for providing this in exchange for an honest review**This was a great introduction to the Romanov dynasty. I'm a little embarrassed to admit the only people I already really knew anything about was Catherine the Great and Anastasia. This was a great book to pick up and put down when you had a few spare minutes. Each chapter is sprinkled with really great footnotes. These weren't really needed, but they were great additions. I liked that the author went out of his way to include little bits of information about the people surrounding the Tsars and their families.This book was a little odd in that the writing changed drastically half way through. I loved the first half of the book. It was exactly what the title promised. These chapters flew by for me. They were filled with humorous (and morbid) tidbits about the early Romanov line. If the whole book had been written this way, it would have been a solid 5 stars. The second half of the book read more like a text book. I still enjoyed most of it, but it took me a lot longer to get through. They were a lot more detailed then the chapters in the first half. While the still focused on the Tsars, the branched out more to include detailed events that happened during the Tsars ruling.I have only one real complaint about this title. Two sections were too drawn out. First was Catherine the Great. She dominated not only her chapter, but also the chapters belonging to her husband and son. Honestly, I grew bored of her. I really wish the author had left her the main focus of her chapter only. Second was the last few chapters dealing with Nicholas and Alexandra. These last chapters were way too dry and drawn out for my taste. They also left me feeling no sympathy whatsoever for Nicholas and Alexandra. I don't condone what happened to them, but I can understand the peoples reaction. Their children are another story. The children never should have suffered that fate they did."}, {"userName": "Christoph Fischer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13998364-christoph-fischer", "userReview": "\"Secret Lives of the Tsars: Three Centuries of Autocracy, Debauchery, Betrayal, Murder, and Madness from Romanov Russia\" by Michael Farquhar is a well written and easy to read account of the private and public lives of three hundred years worth of Russian Emperors and Empresses. Focusing on the violence, the back stabbing and adultery, this reads like a historical soap opera, thanks to the lives of the tsars.Although a lot will never be known for sure, the author seems to have done enough research to make educated guesses. It made me very happy not to have lived in those times. The writing style compresses the history parts and other backgrounds into sizeable chunks, giving a good overview over the European politics and other developments without losing focus on the dynasties and the bloody line to the thrown. Other historians can get lost in the detail, which Farquhar so excellently avoided. However, there is still enough history in it for me to feel that I was reminded of the important basics and leared new facts.A very rich and enjoyable read.I reviewed this book for netgalley.com"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/683792-jen", "userReview": "This was an audio book that I started because I had mind-numbing task for work to do--and I needed something to occupy the 99.5% of my brain the task wasn't going to occupy. I wanted something fun, light-hearted, and nothing that would make me cry (this is a vital consideration as I was at work).Russian history, especially of the Romanovs, is just fascinating. You almost have to forcibly put the early rulers with their Western Europe contemporaries to understand the dramatic contrast in culture and expectations. Ivan the Terrible asked Elizabeth I to marry him, which just boggles the head. This book goes through the entire Romanov family and the rulers. If you ever wanted to feel really good about your own family dynamics--read this book! (Assuming you haven't a) killed your son after telling his wife to put on more clothes; b) beheaded your mistress and then used her decapitated head to give an impromptu anatomy lesson; or c) had your ex lover choose your next lover that would be 1/3 your age. If any of these are true, you should still read this book as it may give you some tips.) Now, no family is perfect. And power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. And wow, were the Romanovs corrupt at times. Even the best of them were kinda squirrelly. Then when you get to Nick II and Alexandra, you know it's going to end poorly. No one could make up a character like Rasputin--because he's unbelievable.The idea of being given a country to rule by the hand of God is so foreign to our modern sensibilities that it's almost impossible to feel empathy for the cast of characters thrown at us. But you sort of have to. The violence of their lives bred violence and eventually it exploded and destroyed the family. The absolute decadence of their lives is surreal.Is this the best book you can read on the Romanovs--no. They are a complicated family in which each character demands a full volume. Can you be entertained by the book equivalent of Daily Mail (I Know) approach to their foibles. Yes, you can. And you can get a lot of mindless work done while you listen."}, {"userName": "Carrie Mansfield ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4883725-carrie-mansfield", "userReview": "*An e-ARC was received through Edelweiss in exchange for a fair review*wp.me/p32oat-R2Normally I try and review books much closer to publication time, but given today\u2019s political environment, a review of how Russia came to be Russia seemed rather fitting. For although the Romanovs have been off the through just shy of a century now (97 years to be exact) if you look at the leadership of the Soviet Union and now Putin, there is a sense that the more things change, the more they stay the same.I want to give a tip of my ushanka to Mr. Farquhar, because he has managed an impressive feat: simplifying three hundred years in a way that, while still very much an overview gives you enough context and insight that it doesn\u2019t necessarily feel shallow. Furthermore, an extra appreciated touch is that book doesn\u2019t focus on the lurid. While he does, of course, mention the rumors of Catherine\u2019s equine lovers, it\u2019s dismissed as quickly as it is brought up. This is a true history book and gives the subjects of the book the respect that they deserve.The only thing I have a quibble with is that the art, and to a more limited extent, the summary almost imply that this might have a humorous element to it and I can\u2019t say that it does. The author keeps what can be some dark history fairly light, but I wouldn\u2019t call this a funny book, outside of a few descriptions in the introduction. It\u2019s not a knock against the book, but it may not be what you\u2019re expecting. When available, you might want to download a sample and see if it\u2019s right for you.As for me, I was pleased with it. I thought the book was well-weighted in terms of time spent on the various Tsars and there is a sufficiently detailed selected bibliography that it should give someone who wants to dig deeper plenty of places to start looking.

Good notes at the end of each chapter, and frequent references to other historians and biographers within the text that may inspire readers to seek out other works. The author\u2019s tight storytelling, combined with foreshadowing, give each chapter a sense of increasing foreboding as the inevitable murder of the Romanovs draws near.

It is 349 pages long and is published by Random House. The cover is illustrated pictures of the various Romanov Tsars. The intended reader is someone who likes history, and Russian history. There is some language, sex, and violence in this book. The story is told from third person perspective with letters, dairies, and other first hand resources for added depth. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- Scandal! Intrigue! Cossacks! Here the world's most engaging royal historian chronicles the world's most fascinating imperial dynasty: the Romanovs, whose three-hundred-year reign was remarkable for its shocking violence, spectacular excess, and unimaginable venality. In this incredibly entertaining history, Michael Farquhar collects the best, most captivating true tales of Romanov iniquity. We meet Catherine the Great, with her end-less parade of virile young lovers (none of them of the equine variety); her unhinged son, Paul I, who ordered the bones of one of his mother's paramours dug out of its grave and tossed into a gorge; and Grigori Rasputin, the \u201cMad Monk,\u201d whose mesmeric domination of the last of the Romanov tsars helped lead to the monarchy's undoing. From Peter the Great's penchant for personally beheading his recalcitrant subjects (he kept the severed head of one of his mistresses pickled in alcohol) to Nicholas and Alexandra's brutal demise at the hands of the Bolsheviks, Secret Live of the Tsars captures all the splendor and infamy that was Imperial Russia.Review- These stories about the Romanovs are funny, heartbreaking, tragic, and blood-thirsty. I liked a lot about this book but the biggest thing that I liked was that Farquhar traced each ruler from birth to death. He does not overwhelm the reader with all the little details of their lives but in the end I have a good basic grounding about their lives and reign. This book is very well written and the research is excellent. Farquhar not only gives a good grounding in the Romanov family but in Russia as well. He talks about why Russia was and is the way that it is to this day. Farquhar clearly loves his job and it shows in his work. The passion to detail, the little footnotes for added favor, and the end notes for further reading everything is just wonderful. The footnotes do what I think that footnotes should do which is just add a little extra something to the narrative. I will be picking up another of his books to read.I give this book a Five out of Five stars.

It covers the tsars in a gossip-rag style, devoting about a chapter to each tsar (with the exception of Nicholas II, who gets three chapters to his downfall).The book was light and easy to read, and it helped me straighten out some of the tsars (I remember Ivan, Peter, Catherine, and then I get muddy until Alexander III). I would call this a very light history (no real original research - Farquhar cites most of the more serious biographers frequently). It's readable and titillating, but I found myself bored with the chapters about Catherine (I loved Robert Massie's Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman) and Nicholas II and Alexandra (too many more books to count). For people who really know the Romanovs, this isn't worth their time.In short, this is a good primer but it's like getting news from Entertainment Tonight instead of CNN.

In his book, Farquhar tells the interesting, scandalous, and shocking tales of the Tsars that ruled the Russian Empire for 300 years from the dynasty's beginning with Michael to its bloody end with Nicholas II. I very much enjoy Russian history so I liked the book, but unfortunately I already knew most of the juicy secrets that were discussed by Farquhar since they were told during my history classes in college. (My classes were fantastically interesting that way!) Surprisingly, the family member that stood out most to me wasn't a Tsar at all but Empress Marie Feodorovna or Minnie. I wonder how she survived the Revolution while so many Romanovs did not, esecially under her Bolshevik captivity in the Crimea. My one problem with Farquhar's book is the lack of citation. He has a select bibliography and uses some in-text citation, but I prefer footnotes or endnotes to see directly were the info or quotations are coming from.

While it does concentrate on the Tsars, particularly their foibles (little things like mass murder), it gives sufficient context to put it in Russian and European context. Having recently read the biography of Catherine the Great, I was able to judge this by comparison. It covers substantially all the same ground but in a more condensed form.

Instead, Farquhar writes like the sleepy student in the back row of a Russian history class whose ears perk up only at the mention of sex and violence.

A good overview of the dynasty."}, {"userName": "Cait", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23734187-cait", "userReview": "What a great little romp through history! You never know with history books if you'll end up with something dry and overly detailed; I would classify Farquhar's work as the \"coles notes\" version of the Romanov dynasty, and actually found that to be pretty refreshing. This was a quick read and written in a way that didn't leave me feeling like I was reading a textbook. Very interesting, and illuminating-- while obviously some readers might find this book too basic (those looking for more precise details and replications of diary entries, etc) I found it to be just right. Like falling down a Wikipedia-hole, which most amateur historians will be familiar with!"}, {"userName": "Deepanshu Gupta", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18971613-deepanshu-gupta", "userReview": "In the mean time I was reading this book I was also studying brief lives of roman emperors and as it seems not much changes when you are in power - be it east or west in 50 AD or be it 19th Century. The characteristics of emperors over the time haven\u2019t changed much. This book gives a very concise and to the point introduction to some of modern(18th century is still modern, right?) Tsars of Russia. They came in all sort of shapes and sizes and with all directional moral compass. Emperors have been stereotyped in the history mainly by their ruthlessness, lack of passion, lust and affairs, insecurity and Tsars in the book are second to none."}, {"userName": "TheSkepticalReader", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2576681-theskepticalreader", "userReview": "Disclosure: A e-copy of this book was provided by NetGalley in exchange for a honest review. All opinions are my own and have not been influenced by any person, place, or event.I primarily wanted to read this book because I have very limited knowledge of Russian history prior to World War II and the rise of Communism. I was a bit concerned that I would have to look up a lot of people, places, and terms since this book is discussing \u201csecret\u201d lives of the Tsars but surprisingly, I didn\u2019t have to use any outside sources to follow through with the book.Secret Lives of the Tsars works both as a book that people with some general knowledge about Russian history can explore as well as a \u201cstarter\u2019s guide\u201d for people such as myself who can thoroughly enjoy the book without getting lost in the midst of all the information. Secret Lives of the Tsars chronologically details the lives of the Russian rulers beginning from 17th century to the early twentieth century. Though I definitely think there is a lot more history to be discussed and studied, I think this book works really well as an interesting beginner\u2019s guide for all readers. There are certain history books that appeal only to those who are thorough devotees of history or who are historians (or politicians) themselves but this book can be loved by all, in my opinion.Farquhar uses a really simple style of writing that is easy to follow and understand. Again, when discussing a book such as this, I think it\u2019s important to discuss what type of demographics it is targeting and the use of common vocabulary is another level that will attract the everyday reader to learn more than what public education in American schools have taught us. Throughout the book, the author does use outside sources but doesn\u2019t overload the book with quotes from other historians (most of the time, he quotes from direct sources such as the emperor/empresses themselves or someone really close to them) and takes the time to explain Russian terminology (and culture) which I really appreciated. He also uses a very light, friendly tone which implies he is writing to inform, not to analyze the history (which a lot of historians will do). It\u2019s like having a really well-spoken, well-educated friend tell you a story.P.S. Even the footnotes at the end of each chapter are worth reading! I highly recommend that you don\u2019t skip past them.As for the historical information itself, I cannot validate or discredit any of the information as fact or fiction. I am not a historian (yet) so I\u2019ll leave this up to the professionals but I appreciate that Farquhar has dedicated a chapter to each of the members of the Russian royalty. I was a bit worried that, since it advertised a book of anecdotal stories, it would focus more on the stories themselves than on the people. But for the most part, I was wrong\u2014it discuss history first and then, with each ruler, throws in a tale or two that is not only very much amusing but something that people are likely to remember because of the absurdity of human nature and our fascination with the\u2026strange and peculiar behaviors of our species. Additionally, as someone who is currently in the History program, this has been a helpful resource for me to read before I divulge myself into studying Russian history in-depth.I did find, however, that the chapters dedicated to Peter III and Paul discussed Catherine II and their relationship with her far too much. In fact, the chapter on Catherine II itself wasn\u2019t nearly as interesting as the chapters dedicated to her husband and son (Peter III and Paul) since her chapter mostly discussed her long string of lovers and her never-ending thirst for sex. It was shocking though, the way Paul was widely questioned to be Catherine\u2019s son from her first lover but no one was really bothered if he was or not.Also, once we get to Alexander I, the book seems to read more like a textbook than something people would find amusing. Like I previously mentioned, Farquhar does not overload the book with too much factual info for the most of the book but halfway through, the book begins to read more like a textbook than an amusing history of Russian\u2019s monarchs. There seems to be more factual, general information (similar to information you can probably look up on Wikipedia) than the up-close-and-personal discussion about the leaders, which became a bit irritating because there wasn\u2019t anything so \u201csecret\u201d about the politics between Russia, France, Austria, Germany, etc. I was waiting for some exciting little stories about their lives which aren\u2019t available in textbooks but instead found these parts rather uninteresting considering what I was expecting.Though, again, please remember that I am a history student so even if these parts might be uninteresting to the general audience, I still found them educational. This lays out a \u201cbasics\u201d of Russian history which I can built upon so I still loved reading the book\u2014even when it seemed more like a textbook.All in all, I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about Russian history! Pick it up if it\u2019s something that appeals to you and maybe you\u2019ll learn something new. Regardless of what you may or may not consider \u201csecret,\u201d it definitely summaries more than three centuries worth of history for you in an appealing form."}, {"userName": "Tracie Stokka", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15958330-tracie-stokka", "userReview": "This book is the adult equivalent of a volume of Terry Dreary's Horrible Histories.

He writes about history the way Doris Kearns Goodwin's smart-ass, reprobate kid brother might. I, for one, prefer it.\"--Gene Weingarten, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and Washington Post columnist Scandal! Intrigue! Cossacks! Here the world's most engaging royal historian chronicles the world's most fascinating imperial dynasty: the Romanovs, whose three-hundred-year reign was remarkable for its shocking violence, spectacular excess, and unimaginable venality. In this incredibly entertaining history, Michael Farquhar collects the best, most captivating true tales of Romanov iniquity. We meet Catherine the Great, with her endless parade of virile young lovers (none of them of the equine variety); her unhinged son, Paul I, who ordered the bones of one of his mother's paramours dug out of its grave and tossed into a gorge; and Grigori Rasputin, the \"Mad Monk,\" whose mesmeric domination of the last of the Romanov tsars helped lead to the monarchy's undoing. From Peter the Great's penchant for personally beheading his recalcitrant subjects (he kept the severed head of one of his mistresses pickled in alcohol) to Nicholas and Alexandra's brutal demise at the hands of the Bolsheviks, Secret Lives of the Tsars captures all the splendor and infamy that was Imperial Russia.Praise for Secret Lives of the Tsars\n \n\"An accessible, exciting narrative . . .
