A real page turner!! My main reading genre is True Crime so it sometimes takes me a little longer to get in to other genres..but that wasn't the case with Naked Addiction!! The author, Caitlin Rother is an excellent True Crime author so I thought I would give this book a try! I was NOT disappointed! I liked the characters and the plot kept me guessing pretty much up to the end! Another thing that I liked and don't see too often was at the end of the book there is a section titled \"BOOK CLUB DISCUSSION QUESTIONS FOR NAKED ADDICTION\" that were pretty thought provoking."}, {"userName": "Sage Friedman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55448174-sage-friedman", "userReview": "Finished only by determination to do so.This book had sex thrown in for readers that need that stuff to keep reading and very little on police procedure. It did a more successful job on showing how newspaper articles get written. Hardest for me was the writing. . . .it was disjointed, poor use of the English language, and sentence and paragraph writing that lacked any beauty or even knowledge of how to do them. I mostly finished it because I was curious how such a book would progress and end. Read only if you have nothing better to do"}, {"userName": "Steve Jackson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35076576-steve-jackson", "userReview": "An excellent mystery thriller by a Pulitzer-Prize nominated and New York Times bestselling author."}, {"userName": "Isaac", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55060649-isaac", "userReview": "***Goodreads giveaway win***First off you cant give 3.5 star ratings but if I could I would.

This is her first (only?) foray into fiction. I can't say how much it is informed by her reporting work, but I imagine she's writing from informed experience, as much as the creative mind. As the novel progresses you can tell this isn't a typical Law & Order type potboiler.Naked Addiction is a crime novel about a young detective looking to prove himself on his first homicide case. I was about to give up reading early on (it was free on Kindle Unlimited), as it seemed like the book was setting up a series of procedural plot points connected by the familiar angsty, pulpy character tropes. I kept with it and I'm glad I did. It turns out Naked Addiction is quite immersive, aided heavily by the great use of location (coastal La Jolla, California, with a scene set at Windansea Beach) and a lead detective who is very much a product of his geography as he is his circumstance. The mystery grips you more and more as it unravels.There's a seriously great ending to be found here, folks."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11894433-cynthia", "userReview": "First thing I have to say is I never saw the end coming what a surprise. Each person you come across could be the killer by the time you work it out you find you are wrong. I really enjoyed the plot I am not sure this entire story is believable but it makes for a great listen. This is one author that is holding the clues very close to her chest not giving you much to go on. A lot of innocent people are getting killed along with Ken\u2019s sister coming up missing. He keeps blowing up her phone and going by her house but she is nowhere to be found. Could she have been another of the killer\u2019s victims? I wouldn\u2019t say this is very graphic for the type of book it could have been. The author gives you the facts telling a little about how the victim is found and the area around them. It was an easy story to get into the author has no trouble holding your attention.I thought Mr. Bruce did a really great job with the narration. His character voices were good you have no trouble understanding who is talking or what they are feeling. At times his voice can be a little flat but you still understand what is going on and that it is very emotional. I enjoyed both his male and female voices. He has a very pleasant voice that does pull the reader in. There are no background noise if any breaks were taken you cannot tell. There are no places where the volume is higher or lower each chapter starts off with the same volume and tones as the one before. Mr. Bruce really pulled me in painting the picture in my mind as the scenes unfold. I haven\u2019t listened to anything by him and look forward to listening to more.Things I had trouble with are that Ken being a detective works with the narcotics division who wants to work with homicide is given such a big role as heading up this investigation. Also that he would trust a news reporter with his feelings on the crime than get mad when he quotes him knowing he is new and looking for a big break such as he himself is. I also had a little trouble with the report I though some of that story line was a little more than needed. He does add a lot to the story just thought it was a little too much filler.I did like how it all ties in to the beauty school and the bar. I enjoyed how they got answers and how the author brings in each character giving a full impact to the read. It is hard to tell what is separate or related with so much going on which adds to the read. The story has a great build up with a wonderful plot. Ken really got into the first victim seeing her really affected him even his dreams. My heart really went out to him over him reliving his mother\u2019s death. He and his sister really had a hard growing up. The author really throws in a lot of twists and turns which has your mind all over the place trying to work it out. For me that is a good things I love trying to work out who did it. I really missed it on this one. At first I had it worked out and then let the author talk me out of it lol. My ranting is a high 3 or a low 4. The author keeps the read interesting with a steady pace. The characters are likable even if you are trying to second guess them. I did really enjoy the story and the narration. I do look forward to reading more of this author work. It was worth a listen just to see how this author mind works as she twists a very good plot."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16831198-wendy", "userReview": "\"Naked Addiction\" which I won through Goodreads Giveaways is a gripping, fast-paced thriller that begins when an undercover narcotics detective discovers the body of a young woman hidden among trashcans in an alley. In an investigation that has Ken Goode proving his skill in uncovering clues to the murder that has ties to a beauty school, escort service and an narcotics ring, he's hounded by a cub report looking for a sensational scoop. When Goode's sister is linked to one of the suspects and she suddenly disappears, his tension mounts as the case takes a sinister turn with the discovery of two more corpses. The author sets the stage for an intoxicating plot in La Jolla, California with its affluent community, and sinister underbelly. Threads of the plot follow not only the investigation of the murder but also the friends, lover and family impacted by it. With every twist and turn as new victims and crimes are exposed tension and suspense are built into a roller coaster ride that never stops until the killer's identity is exposed. With skillful dexterity the author has woven a plot that not only deals with broken people who use sex, alcohol, drugs and cigarettes to fill their emptiness, but also a hero who's addicted to caffeine and troubled women. In a plot that's well-written and captivating from beginning to end, even the climax holds a shocking surprise.Cleverly Caitlin Rother fleshs out the personalities of complex and realistic characters that are compelling with all their flaws and faults. Ken Goode a detective who wants to transfer from narcotics to homicide is intense and caring, with a eye for detail and a strong gut instinct. Haunted by a bad marriage and a weakness for damaged women, he becomes fixated on the murder victim through her journal entries. Tania Marcus, the initial victim masks her insecurity and sensitivity behind a tough, irresponsible and stubborn exterior. In contrast her friend Alison Winslow, victimized by an abusive childhood and the violent temper of an older lover is shy, lonely and vulnerable; a young woman searching for a stable relationship. Seth Kennedy is a handsome, self-centered, arrogant real estate agent while Keith Warner is his steadfast, caring friend whose smarts get him into trouble. Of all the characters that add power, drama and passion to this intriguing plot, I liked Norman Klein, the young non-aggressive but intrepid report who develops not only his journalistic skill but in temperament as the story progresses. Yet it's the helpless instability of Clover Ziegler, the hot tempered violence of Tony Marcus, and the ruthless remorselessness of the killer that lend a dark chill to the story.I loved \"Naked Addiction\" which blends murder, sex and drugs into an absorbing criminal investigation. Ken Goode is a fascinating, likable but imperfect detective who I hope Caitlin Rother will resurrect in future novels."}, {"userName": "LORI CASWELL", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4770012-lori-caswell", "userReview": "Dollycas\u2019s ThoughtsI was first introduced to Caitlin Rother\u2019s work through her True-Crime stories, Lost Girls, Dead Reckoning and I\u2019ll Take Care of You so I was already a fan. I knew this book was out there and the author was continuing to improve it and get it published. I am so glad things came together. This book started out as a short story and she used the knowledge she gained from writing True-Crime to make this an outstanding fictional story.What Rother has given us in a complex mystery that brings together sex, drugs and murder. The story has so many layers and more that a few twists. It is so well-written. The authors years as a journalist shine as she draws the reader into the story.Police Detective Ken Goode is so good! He is juggling several balls in the air and he tries to solve this murder and his police career comes full circle. He is also a man with a tragic past the has shaped the way he looks at life in general.Norman Klein, the cub reporter has had this murder investigation story dropped into his lap because the regular crime reporter is out sick. He has the editor riding his back continually to get the story first with all the details, even when the police are not releasing much in the way of details. He goes to some very dangerous lengths to deliver what his boss wants. He clearly is not using his head as he goes places he has no business going.Like most murder investigations there are several leads and not all of them pan out. The reader is taken behind the scenes and into the procedures followed as the investigation takes many different directions and I was totally surprised with the ending. At one point I thought and I knew the who and the why but I was only right on half of my theory and it was a theory I threw out several times as another suspect came to the forefront. So for me this was a perfect read.I really like these characters and I hope Rother continues their stories in a future novel or series. She is already off to an excellent start."}, {"userName": "Mariana Bezerra", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4165508-mariana-bezerra", "userReview": "One of the first reads from this year and is a big book, but I find it a bit disappointing. Ken Goode is a detective from California who works on narcotics and is trying to apply for a space on the homicides head quarts. Nothing wrong there, Goode works a lot for the position, but it\u2019s a bit disturbing that the sergeant put him on charge for a big case like this one, especially with all the media working around and he is not a homicide detective yet.Goode has issues from his past, connected with his mother suicide and afterwards his father left him and a little sister. So growing up he had a difficult home which make harder for him some moments to dealt with death so close.I didn\u2019t like the way the first death was almost the center point for the entire book, especially since it wasn\u2019t the only one. Goode obsessed with the deceased girl and took everything to find the killer. On the other end the author made good characters explaining everyone and how they could be connected with the girl.The book is a bit slow to get into but after the first results start to show is very interesting to read on.
