She is a travel agent by day, but by night, she takes classes and seminars in poetry, joins a writer's group. Studying poets and their forms, she longs to be the poet that she feels she could be if she has the right mentor. She finds one in Jonathan, who is, unbeknownst to Genny, struggling with finding his own poetic voice. Together they form a bond of words, and Genny falls in love with her \"Mountain Man\" poet. Sharing poems, Genny falls deeper into love, giving of herself, being seduced, mentored, and always playing with words and ideas. He is, at times, caring and nurturing; other times, he is aloof and silent. When she finally finds out that he is married, she wallows in her despair and finally leaves the city which she has embraced. Moving to New York, with her fellow travel agent and friend Deets. As she is healing from her broken heart, she discovers that Jonathan has been published. He has taken her poems claiming they are his. He is being touted as the next great poet. From this, she knows she truly is a poet, and goes on.What next for Genevieve DuPont? This is a lyrical read with each chapter starting with references to poets and their works to comtemplate. At its heart it is a woman's story: of love found and lost, of friendship and family, of the art of poetry and the artists who craft words."}, {"userName": "Nicola Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20034080-nicola-smith", "userReview": "Attending a poetry workshop once a week is the only let up Genny DuPont receives after she works 40 hour weeks for a travel agency. There is a man at the group who she calls Mountain Man, who's poetry is so amazing that Genny starts to crave him, to want to know more. There is an instant connection between Jenny and Jon (Mountain Man) but Jon himself is struggling to find his poetic inspiration. His dream of becoming a famous, printed poet is slipping away so he uses Genny as his muse. Things take an unexpected turn through the story, with love, lust and betrayal.I have to admit poetry isn't really my thing and i wouldn't have looked at this book twice, but from the first page i was hooked. Genny & Jon were amazing characters to read and i got fully dragged into their relationship - especially as their connection appears to be on a higher level. The ending shocked me and i don't want to give to much away but i was angry for her, angry at what happened. This is a great read for anyone and a MUST READ for poetry fans."}, {"userName": "Fran", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1032865-fran", "userReview": "A Winged Thing and Holy: Mary Gray KayePoems are powerful and often embrace and engulf the reader taking them into many different worlds, dimensions leaving them breathless and filled with emotion. Each person takes away their own interpretation and message from the poems they read. Poems can evoke emotions, describes torments that the writer has endured. Poems can paint a picture of places you would love to visit and poems can tell a story about a person\u2019s life. Author Mary Gray Kaye takes readers into the worlds of Genny and Jonathan. Genny a travel agent wanting more in life than just booking trips for her clients. Jonathan, elusive, retired and spending most of his days creating dishes for his wife and writing poetry. Genny and Jonathan are both in the same poetry class. When Genny is asked to read her offering she finds herself at a loss at times for the right words, phrases or topics. Genny finds herself becoming consumed with poetry, looking up the masters, studying their style and quite taken with Jonathan. A simple email complementing her reading sets them off on journey that would change her perspective about love, deceit, poetry and life. Jon a seasoned poet and in her poetry writing group uses the right words to elicit the reaction he wants and a relationship that should never have been. Hiding behind her sestinas, her poetry books and her romantic fantasies, Genny develops a life is devoid of any identity of herself. Hoping to emulate this man and become part of his life and eventually a great poet she discounts time with her male friend Brian, enlists the opinions of her sister and a close friend and begins on a five month journey that would change her forever. Is there more to life than sending people on vacation? What happens that sends her over the top and reading Henry James and many other poets that the author brilliantly shares with readers in her emails between the two characters and the start of each chapter to entice her to learn more, understand the meaning of loneliness, love and to send readers to their computers to read more of the same that Genny is reading within the pages of this book. Referring to him as the Mountain Man, the guest speaker at poetry seminar she winds up at, little does she know that she would find herself in a whole other world or at times dimension. Encouraged by his emails and finally their time together, Genny begins writing and the words begin to flow. Sharing the many sestinas is quite interesting, as I have never really studied this type of poem before. With Jon\u2019s advice about her poetry, advancing their relationship what will she do when she learns that Karen is not his muse but his wife? Poems are powerful and often people bury themselves in a novel, short story or a poem to take away the pain, find a place for themselves and seek comfort in the words of others when in reality there is no other. The relationship between Jon and Genny is rocky. But Genny knows she can always turn to poetry for comfort. However, when it becomes clear to her that their relationship won't work for either of them, she decides to move to New York City and cut all contact with Jon. A few months later, she has settled into her new life. She decides to attend a poetry reading and is furious to see that Jon has published her poems she had sent him while they were together under his name. Now Genny knows she must fight for what is rightfully hers. The plot was slower paced, but full of details. I think that it's actually kind of nice that the pacing of A Winged Thing, and Holy is on the slow side because it allows for more character development, which was excellent in this book. The back of the book (you know, where there's a little blurb) pretty much gave away the ending though, since it said Genny would bring Jon to court for plagiarism. I thought that the trial would be like the climax of the story, not the ending. I guess it just wasn't what I expected.Things take a drastic turn when Jonathan disappears for a while and Genny seems to revert back into herself. It\u2019s almost as if he has become so much a part of her that she cannot divorce herself from him. Without his encouragement to write and create the powerful poems she has penned, she feels lost and alone at times needing him to fill a serious void within herself. Deciding to take a class in poetry even for no credit, she encountered stanzas, poetry, meters and much more. Meeting Shannah, reworking her sestina and wanting to be a part of the anthology she was creating spirited her on until something changes it all. Her favorite client is killed in a car crash leaving her with another void in her life. Presenting her with many cookbooks from his voyages and trips she can rekindle memories just by looking at each title. With her sister\u2019s wedding on hand and the preparations being made Genny could focus on something other than Jon and her poems. But, a special trip and a special four days in Paris come to a crashing halt when she returns. Coming smack dab face to face with his wife would finally hit her like a bucket of ice and hopefully awaken her to the harsh realities of this deceitful man. But, there is much more. Within her emails to him you can hear her despair, her unsettling feelings and the finality that finally comes when she realizes that she can no longer deal with the pain he is causing her. \u201c Happiness is pretty much what is now. And yesterday and tomorrow.\u201d But, will Genny ever understand the true meaning of the word and will she ever let his hold on her feelings be forever released?When Genny finally realizes the truth she decides to move to New York and make a permanent change. Along with her close friend Deets she hopes to start over again but a simple citing in the book section of the paper and her whole world came down. Your words are your own and your lines belong to you except when someone steals them and claims them as their own. Find out what happens when Jonathan uses her words and claims them as his own. Will Genny stand by and let him have her poems and not fight back? Will she use her feelings for him as an excuse and do nothing? What would you do if someone stole your lines, your thoughts and invaded your heart for their own self worth? Poor self-esteem, needing to feel important, having more than one person to admire him as a man and living his life by pretending to be something he is not, just how far would Jonathan Waterhouse go to pretend to be a success? Lies, deceits, adultery, greed, theft and dishonesty are just some words that describe him. A Winged Thing and Holy: Each chapter title speaks out about one character as we being with Genny the poet, going on to the happy earth, Jonathan Masquerades and finally parched holy mouth and an epilogue that will surprise the reader with a twist you won\u2019t expect. Take the five month journey with Genny, Deets, Denise and Jonathan and find out whose Wings still fly and whose words will always remain Holy!Author Mary Gray Kaye created a character that has much more potential and I truly hope she brings Genny back again giving her the strength to find happiness in life, her experiences and not just in her words.\u201cThe sestina is a challenging form in which, rather than simply rhyming, the actual line-ending words are repeated in successive stanzas in a designated rotating order. A sestina consists of six six-line stanzas, concluding with a three-line \u201cenvoi\u201d which incorporates all the line-ending words, some hidden inside the closing lines. The prescribed pattern for using the six line-ending words is:1st stanza 1 2 3 4 5 6 2nd stanza 6 1 5 2 4 3, 3rd stanza 3 6 4 1 2 5, 4th stanza 5 3 2 6 1 4, 5th stanza 4 5 1 3 6 2, the 6th stanza 2 4 6 5 3 1 and the envoi 2--5 4--3 6\u20141\u201d http://poetry.about.com/od/poeticform...As you read some of these types of poems and hear the ones the author presents within this novel you understand the powerful messages of each one, stories behind the words and the difficulty in writing this type of poem. The author includes the words of Henry James, Blake, Shelley and many others to entice readers.

Nevertheless, she feels as if there is something more to her life than ordering plane tickets for her clients. So she decides to attend a poetry seminar and ends up falling heels over head for the guest speaker: Jon Waterhouse, also known as the Mountain Man. Jon is an aspiring poet and can mesmerize the audience when he reads poetry.Under the guide of Jon, Genny begins to craft some poetry herself. To her surprise, she's actually writing decent poems. Pretty soon, words are bursting out of her on their own accord. Getnny continues to email Jon, hoping to receive advice on her poems and to spark a friendship between them.Although Jon offers minimal advice regarding her poetry, he does seem more than happy to start a relationship with Genny. There's just one minor problem: Genny doesn't know Jon's a married man.The relationship between Jon and Genny is rocky. But Genny knows she can always turn to poetry for comfort.

For me, there has to be a certain way that a blurb is constructed to where it is intriguing and will not kill the sales of your book.Layman\u2019s Terms: Do Not spoil your story in the blurb. Reading the blurb (in MY eyes) tells me that I already read the story WITHOUT reading the story.Story wise\u2026Genevieve is a young lady from Utah who migrated to Chicago to look for what any typical person seeks: Happiness. She also has a strong love for poetry dating back to her youth when her father read to her. She takes courses at her local college to firm up and strengthen her poetry skills in the name of bettering herself as a poetic artist. A chance interaction with Jon Waterhouse (\u201cMountain Man\u201d as Genevieve calls him) causes our protagonist to fantasize and drool all over herself at the thought of being with him.What I like about the book:-A poem starts every chapter,-Great description of surroundings and characters,-A nice chuckle here and there, and-Genevieve Dupont is quite likable.There are missed opportunities in the punctuation department and sentence structure departments. Specifically missing periods at the end of a few sentences, the opening sentence is a run on (it feels that way to me), and I am not REALLY SURE if it is my PDF copy yet there is a spacing discrepancy in some areas.Those discrepancies can be forgiven had the narrator NOT called Genevieve Dupont \u201cGenny\u201d through the whole story. Reading \u201cGenny\u201d from the narrator of the story says to me that said narrator is by Genevieve\u2019s side, documenting everything that is going on with her as either a close friend or a family member. IF this is NOT the case, \u201cGenny\u201d SHOULD BE addressed by the narrator as Genevieve. Period, Point Blank.All in all, the story is quasi-romance, shoots from the hip, and is not too shabby.\u201cA Winged Thing, and Holy\u201d is a poet\u2019s book, flat out. This is a not too bad book with the element of poetic art that I have grown to love and write myself.

The descriptions of the scenes of Chicago and Paris were so vivid I felt like I was there. The story flowed with it's prose that I didn't want it to end. Even though I am not a poetry fan I looked forward to a snippet of poetry in the beginning of each chapter. Ginny is the main character and at 37 years old decides she needs something more than her travel agent job so she takes a poetry seminar . She meets Jonathan the experienced poetry writer in the group. Jonathan is retired and basically writes poetry and takes care of the home while his wife is at work. Ginny and Jonathan become romantically involved but poetry is the basis of their relationship. Even though Ginny is a beginner in poetry writing she is naturally talented compared to Jonathan. She sends e-mails of her writing to Jon to help guide her with format in the beginning. As the story continues I found myself deeply caring for Ginny and disliking Jonathan. Ginny does not know he is a married man until later in the story. The relationship becomes rocky and it ends. Ginny takes a job in New York and settles in quite nicely. After living there for some months she attends a poetry reading and is furious to see that Jon published her poems. Ginny wins the plagiarism in court. I thought this would be the ending but I was happily incorrect. I usually pass on my fiction books to friends, library, etc. but I have kept a few throughout the years and this book will be one of them. This book was well written and I could see myself reading it again. All the characters in the book were well developed and many details. I do hope the author will be writing another book."}, {"userName": "Harmony Kent", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20096235-harmony-kent", "userReview": "Reviewed, on behalf of The Review BoardGenny Dupont is a dissatisfied travel agent looking for love. She joins a poetry class and meets a guy she calls \u201cMountain Man\u201d. He isn\u2019t all that he seems, and Genny soon gets her fingers burned. If you don\u2019t want any spoilers, then I strongly suggest you avoid reading the book blurb, because this gives the plot away and will leave you with no surprises.Although the book is listed within Women\u2019s Contemporary Fiction, I feel it is more at home in the Romance Genre, and it has a strong poetry component. If you like poetry, then all well and good. If you don\u2019t, you might struggle with this book.The plot is straightforward for the most part, with a nice twist towards the end (unless you\u2019ve read the blurb, then you\u2019ll know what\u2019s coming). The pacing is very slow, and continues at this speed throughout the novel. The characters are well drawn, but I still struggled to get involved in their stories. This could have something to do with the narrative style, which I struggled with. There is a distinct lack of comma usage, and punctuation in general. Also, missing quote marks and other grammatical errata make for a difficult read at times. If you enjoy a clean romance, with lots of poetry and poetic references, then this book may be for you. The pace is leisurely, and follows the main character\u2019s development from being lost and unsure into maturity and direction. I offer six out of ten stars using The Review Board\u2019s rating, which translates into three out of five stars elsewhere."}, {"userName": "Chicagoreader101", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22116052-chicagoreader101", "userReview": "So much to like. I really thought the protagonist was likeable and I mostly understood her motivations. I liked the sense of place that the novel had, Paris and Chicago both seemed to be described vividly. I liked the story and found it at times quite surprising, at other times the story seemed to follow a good path. I loved the use of words in the novel, I'm not a huge poetry fan but loved the way it was used here. I also loved Genny's obsession with poetry and one poet in particular, you could see she wanted some kind of big change in her life.The thing that makes this a 3 star? There is a huge betrayal in this book (actually there are two, but one for me looms large) and I wanted to see the betrayer get punished (sorry, don't want to spoil). It is dealt with, but much of it is \"off screen\" and I guess I wanted to be a fly on the wall of comeuppance. Or something.Still, a strong and well crafted book.

I'm not one for emotional reads, so I probably won't read it again. It is very well written though. Everything is very clear, no hidden agendas or things that could be taken one way or the other.
