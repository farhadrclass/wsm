Kelley\u2019s first clue that this Christmas will be different begins when he walks in on his wife kissing Santa Claus. The two have one child, a son Bart, who is stationed in Afghanistan. His oldest son Patrick a highly successful broker and happily married father of three is in trouble. His daughter, Ava a local schoolteacher is in a stalled relationship and not at all-happy. His youngest son from his first marriage is having an affair with their French-maid. His ex-wife a wildly successful news broadcaster is planning to spend the holiday on a nice warm beach far, far away.The tale that unfolds in Winter Street is not your typical holiday story, but takes us into the lives of this close-knit family as Hilderbrand shares a not so perfect Christmas. Delivered from each of the Quinn\u2019s perspective we follow each of the stories as we move through the holiday, discover truths, and band together. Quirky, heart-felt, and genuine I enjoyed learning about this family.Winter Street takes place between the 23rd and 25th of December and it was a delightful listen thanks to Erin Bennett who did a lovely job with the narration. While I became caught up in all of the many threads, I would have liked more depth to the characters. This is not a warm fuzzy holiday listen, nor is it dark it is simply a glimpse into one family\u2019s not so perfect holiday. Because the tale ends soon after Christmas dinner, there were unanswered questions. At first, I thought I was missing part of the audio. However, I have learned that these characters and their story will appear again. It is my hope we see each character further developed.Winter Street was an enjoyable listen and despite wanting more, I thoroughly enjoyed spending the holiday with the Quinn\u2019s of Nantucket.Audio provided by publisher"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26175098-christine", "userReview": "3.5 starsIt is starting to feel like winter outside; the wind is blowing hard, the skies are gray, and the weather guy is predicting snow. Furthermore, I have just finished reading several very intense thrillers. So what could be better at this point than a fluffy Christmas book? I hit the library and came home with Winter Street, which proved to be just what I needed.Winter Street is my first experience with an Elin Hilderbrand book. Other reviewers state this isn\u2019t her best work. Though it does not provide as much depth as some other women\u2019s fiction novels I have read, I still found it entertaining. Probably the features I liked best were the likeable characters, all the different family dynamics, and Ms. Hilderbrand\u2019s humor that is laced throughout the story at just the right moments.We are introduced to Kelley Quinn and his wife Mitzi who run the Winter Street Inn on Nantucket Island. Between them they have 4 grown children, an ex-wife, and a lover. The story runs from December 23 to Christmas evening as the family and their significant others gather. Within the group, there are multiple issues going on, leading to a wide swath of emotions ranging from sheer joy to utter agony. One might say that it is a bit unbelievable that so much drama could be happening at once, but that didn\u2019t bother me, and I went with it. The ending did not tidy everything up, but I learned there is a sequel titled Winter Stroll that has been recently released that I put on reserve at my library. Since I don\u2019t have to wait a year for it, I\u2019m happy. I recommend Winter Street to anyone looking for a light, but warm family Christmas drama to read over a cold wintery weekend. I enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10503220-dana", "userReview": "I like to occasionally read with the seasons the way I seem to plan my meals with seasonal foods in mind, so when I saw a few GR friends had rated this book fairly high, I thought it sounded good and would give it a try for the holidays.Years ago I might have found this to be something I would enjoy, but the older I get, the less this genre appeals to me.

Elin Hilderbrand has woven together a juicy cast of characters with lots of drama for this Christmas-themed family treat. The Quinn family is your typical American family in many ways. Kelly and his first wife Margaret are divorced. They have three grown children, Kevin, Patrick and Ava. Kelly has one grown son with his second wife, Mitzi (who can't help but draw the comparison of ditzy when in the opening pages of the book, she announces she's leaving her husband for their bed and breakfast's \"Santa Claus\" from the annual Christmas party.) Kelly is oblivious to their affair, and oblivious to the drama of his oldest three children, including a relationship that is going nowhere, another relationship carried on in secret, and a workplace secret that could land someone in hot water. When all parties show up at the inn, there is merriment and lots of interesting drama. I really enjoyed this one. It had great notes of Christmas and was well-paced.

He is the father of four adult children and is looking forward to having the family together (except son Bart, who recently joined the Marines and is in Afghanistan). Then he walks in on Mitzi, his second wife, kissing Santa Claus, and suddenly, Kelley\u2019s Christmas hopes go from ho, ho, ho to bah, humbug.Each chapter features a different family member attempting to cope with his or her own problems, including daughter Ava, sons Kevin and Patrick, and ex-wife Margaret, who is a famous television anchor. There is also, of course, poor Kelley, who is ready to cancel the Christmas party and sell the inn. My initial reaction was, \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d It felt crazy, frenetic, laughable \u2013 and not in a wonderful, funny way. The writing just didn\u2019t feel good. Honestly, it felt like a soap opera, or a Hallmark Christmas movie gone wrong.As the book progressed, however, the pieces began to come together. The characters began to feel less like caricatures, and the Quinns started to feel more like an actual family. The affection felt more genuine and the humor, less forced. One of the criticisms that I read in a number of reviews was that there is no ending, that we are left hanging. I did not find that to be the case, at least no more so than any fiction, because life goes on and on and on. While it is true that we don\u2019t know exactly what happens to each and every character, especially to Bart, we do know that this family is there for one another, naughty or nice.

I devoured it, and really hadn't expected to. Let's hit the plot highlights shall we? Kelley Quinn owns and operates the Winter Street Inn with his second wife, the unfortunately named Mitzi. They celebrate the holiday season lavishly, with two of the children of his first marriage in house, eldest son on the way, and sadly, their youngest in Afghanistan. Sounds like a typical year, until Mitzi is found kissing Santa, and not under the mistletoe, causing an abrupt split, youngest son Kevin is struggling to bring his affair with the French Isabelle, the inns \"girl Friday\" to the open, and daughter Amy trying to bring her beau up to proposing. Add in the oldest son, Patricks insider trading scandal, and no one is having a very merry season. When tension in Afghanistan gets worse, and Kelley's major news broadcaster ex wife gets information on the Quinn family's soldier, bringing her to their Nantucket inn, all the players are in place to make this a life changing holiday. Told from the viewpoints of all of the characters involved,except curiously, the two timing Mitzi, this novel rolls along so fast and so seamlessly, that I had a hard time finding a place to set it down.

It features several different mini-stories told from the viewpoints of several different characters, which I liked... in theory. The problem was that I found these stories to be only mildly interesting. I also couldn't quite get into the writing style. There was nothing particularly wrong with it (I can't even really put my finger on exactly what it was that bothered me); I suppose it just didn't flow as well as I thought it should. Lastly, the characters were sort of dull and lifeless -- I couldn't imagine them as real people in the real world, and I cared very little about what was happening in their lives. The only thing that really pushed me forward while reading his book was the expectation that it would get better, that something big would happen. It never did.

(2.5 Stars)Rather than summarizing the story, want to get straight away to the issues. Since I have been in the hotel business most of my career, a former innkeeper, and a consultant for boutique hotels and inns, and business planning for investment vacation real estate properties, was hoping for a heartwarming story with interesting characters coming to the inn (as always a story there),  as this was the main reason for buying the audiobook, as my favorite guests are European travelers. Donna Ball's books and The Ladybug Farm series--a perfect example of good B&B stories.  However, there was not much in the way of inn operations, or guests, as the book was focused on this family and all their drama and problems, without a lot of depth nor interesting characters. It started out a little funny; however, sadly disappointed. I gave her last book 2 stars, and pushing it with a 2.5 stars this time, just because it is Christmas and is set in Nantucket. Having read all sixteen of Hilderbrand\u2019s books, as loved her older books, as checked back on Goodreads as to when this began to change. Either my reading interests have drastically changed (which could be), or she has completely changed her style, since around 2010, starting with The Island and downhill since. The good ones are from 2002-2009 (please go back to this). I keep reading thinking it will go back to the old ways; however, her books are no longer captivating me or grabbing me, nor am I invested in any of the characters. (I did enjoy her last two short novellas). I will give 2015 one more shot before closing this door. If you like more of a soap opera drama, you may enjoy; however, I enjoy more substance and complex plot planning. On a side note, I am sensing a little of the same with Nancy Thayer, another Nantucket author, as have read all her books, as well and not the same over the last few years; and both started around the same time with the change. If you are one of the older fans, you may be able to relate as have seen a few other reviewers sharing the opinion."}], "description": "In bestseller Elin Hilderbrand's first Christmas novel, a family gathers on Nantucket for a holiday filled with surprises.Kelley Quinn is the owner of Nantucket's Winter Street Inn and the proud father of four, all of them grown and living in varying states of disarray.
