Finishing one of my favorite-for-all-time series is not a time to mourn, well not much. I kept making the joke that it would be tragic if I died before Birdsall got me to this point. Even though I'm mostly healthy, it was actually a fear. But here we are, and I can't be more glowing in my praise for not just this title, but the whole series. I always appreciate a project that knows where it is going and knows how to end. I can safely say that Penderwicks is the BREAKING BAD of children's lit - not the meth empire part just the tight story-telling part.

Skye has made it clear over and over again throughout the series that she does not have romantic feelings for Jeffrey, and I think that them ending up together would have required disregarding four books of development. Skye and Jeffrey didn't want the same things, and I think them being together would have felt forced and more like fan wish-fulfillment than a genuine ending. The idea of Jeffrey and Batty as a couple had never occurred to me before this book, but I actually liked how their story wrapped up, and I think they make a good match. The main thing I wanted from this book was a Rosalind and Tommy wedding. I have been rooting for them since the beginning, and even though I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get to see the actual wedding, I was happy that it was Rosalind and Tommy getting married. Overall, I can see why people didn't like this book, but I thought it was the perfect ending to one of my favorite series (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tirzah Eleora", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39336161-tirzah-eleora", "userReview": "I had such high hopes for this book! I\u2019ve been waiting for a worthy finale to this series since I read \u2018The Penderwicks in Spring\u2019 shortly after it was published and it proved to be one of the only books that\u2019s ever made me tear up. These hopes have been crushed. This book was anything but a worthy finale...it was worse than bad; it was mediocre. It was flat and boring, and had very little of the touching whimsy of it\u2019s forerunners. And despite the fact that it\u2019s a book about the Penderwicks, we don\u2019t see much of the greater part of the family. Warning: lots of spoilers and complaining ahead. The biggest issue with this book is obvious; why didn\u2019t Skye and Jeffery get married and who the heck is this Czech dude?? Skye and Dusek should not have happened! Is anyone happy about this? I\u2019m not an author personally, but if I were, I don\u2019t see why I would spend four books developing a relationship history between two of my characters only to completely chuck this entire storyline in the fifth and final book and have the girl marry some random guy. Why?? Not only was Dusek random, Birdsall doesn\u2019t bother to tell us a single thing about him, he only shows up in one scene in the whole book to say something in Czech to Skye, and on top of this Birdsall doesn\u2019t even bother to make Skye seem very in love with him. She only marries him because Rosalind is already getting married and the wedding planning is being done by her...doesn\u2019t that make it a marriage of convenience of a kind? Just...NO THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. Skye and Jeffery. They were meant to be. *sobs* My second biggest qualm with this book was the absence of the older Penderwicks, and the amount of time that was instead wasted on irrelevancies. As Lydia is the main character of course it\u2019s natural that the focus should be more heavily on the children, but a huge amount of this book was spent describing Lydia and Alice playing in fields and talking to a sheep. It was redundant and wasteful of time that could have been spent including other characters. Also, Too. Many. Dogs. Seriously, so much of this book was just relating what various dogs were doing and talking about how great they are. At one point, several pages were spent describing a dog watching a chicken..... words cannot describe how frustrating it is to wait for years for a book only to get it and find it\u2019s comprised of things like a Great Dane watching chickens. This does not count as a plot. Speaking of plots, there isn\u2019t one. Lydia and Batty go to Arundel to prepare for Rosalind\u2019s wedding. We mostly just see Lydia and Alice playing. Ben goes around filming things. Batty\u2019s ex-boyfriend randomly shows up and leaves again a few chapters later. Alice and her absent brother Jack text each other pictures of themselves having fun. Mrs. Tifton shows up and she and the Penderwicks get on each others nerves.... I wasn\u2019t expecting a thriller, but I sure thought I\u2019d get something better than this. It didn\u2019t have much life. And while we\u2019re talking about Mrs. Tifton, am I the only who though Jeanne Birdsall was gearing up to reconcile her with Jeffery\u2019s dad? She\u2019s always slinking around and making a point of avoiding him so I thought maybe she was going to do something with that...but I guess not. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure what the point of bringing Mrs. Tifton in was. It was also very anticlimactic that the characters spend the book preparing for a wedding, and the actual event is not shown, or even talked about. I\u2019m very disappointed in the whole book. I know the author can do better than this; she proved it with the rest of the series. As it is, I suppose I will just have to go reread the first four and pretend this one didn\u2019t happen, and that everyone married who they should have."}, {"userName": "Digne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19205628-digne", "userReview": "It's still two years away! ...

ATTENTION: This review is chock full of spoilers. So go no further if that is not okay with you.-First Thoughts-I AM FRUSTRATED. And I feel betrayed by Birdsall. Why? Because this last book, the culmination to years spent with these characters completely fell flat. It lacked the emotion, the passion, and depth of insight of the previous books. There was no conflict. NO CONFLICT I TELL YOU!What the heck is the point of reading a book where everything goes smoothly? It\u2019s boring. Granted, my 8-year-old self was not a fan of conflict. My stories had the sole purpose of removing conflict and making all my characters have these perfect lives. Unfortunately, I soon realized that once you take out the conflict there isn\u2019t much left to tell.That said, I would have been fine with the lack of conflict if certain character\u2019s stories had been completed. There were loose threads waiting to be tied up that never got tied up.Why am I so aggravated? Because Skye does not marry Jeffrey. Rather Birdsall copied Little Woman which I was hoping she wouldn\u2019t do. I saw it coming, yet I hoped against hope that she would not copy Louisa May Alcott and stick the youngest, Batty, with the main protagonist Jeffrey. But that is exactly was she did.All through the series she has been foreshadowing that their relationship would evolve into something romantic when they\u2019re older. Namely because they both are passionate about music and in the first book Batty says she will marry Jeffrey. But that was when she was 4! She was always younger than him so it was just weird. Now that her character is grown up it isn\u2019t weird, but at the same time it still is! Because there is no time for us to see this new relationship between Batty and Jeffrey. It gets pushed to the sidelines. And that deep connection and bond of friendship between Skye and Jeffrey? Kaput. It\u2019s like it never happened.So much character development happened behind the scenes that we aren\u2019t privy to.I loved Skye and Jeffrey together. Yet at the same time I can understand why some people may think they might not be the best together. I understand why she put Batty and Jeffrey together, they both love music and are gentle and kind. BUT they don\u2019t have that friendship and chemistry that Skye and Jeffrey have!The story starts with Rosalind announcing her and Tommy\u2019s wedding at Arundel. It\u2019s told from the viewpoint of the youngest Penderwick, Lydia. I really enjoyed Lydia, she was fun, fresh but I missed reading from multiple character\u2019s perspectives. That said, since she was the youngest there were a lot of scenes where she gets shut out of important conversations because she\u2019s too young. All well and good, but that means we as readers miss out on those conversations too!Then we find out that Skye is dating a Czech guy named Dusek! A character we don\u2019t even know and never get to know! They barely talk about him!! At first I was fine, thinking she would break up with him once she got reunited with Jeffrey, but no! The end up getting married, and don't even mention any past chemistry between her and Jeffrey.Then Batty starts out dating a sweet new character named Wesley. He and Batty are perfect together. He\u2019s an artists, sweet and kind with a lovable 3 legged dog. She breaks up with him before going to Arundel however. A bright spot was that once Lydia gets to Arundel she finds a new friend named Alice. Alice was one of my favorite characters. Her and Wesley kept me from disliking this book too much. Still too much of the story is spent describing Alice and Lydia playing in a field.Back to the plot \u2013> Skye decides she wants to get married too and everything progresses smoothly for the wedding plans. But whenever Skye is talking it just didn\u2019t feel like her. Everything was a little off. Batty was older so it was understandable that her character would change. Just so much of the story centered around her and I felt like I didn\u2019t even know her. It was strange and I didn\u2019t get nearly enough details and time spent with the older Penderwick sisters I know and love. I like Batty, but her character just felt rather distant.Back to the plot again. Mrs. Tifton shows up and gets all upset because the Penderwicks are back destroying her property. Then Wesley shows up because he\u2019s jealous of Jeffrey. But it all comes to nothing. The worst part? When Skye sees Jeffrey for the first time in forever they don\u2019t interact! What happened? What did I miss?The story wraps up and we don\u2019t even get to see the wedding!!!Now let me talk about some of the pros of this story. Because there were parts I enjoyed.Pros:Lydia was delightful. I liked getting to know the youngest Penderwick.Ben was funny and likeable. He reminds me of my own brother. His obsession with making movies was humorous and it was fun to read about his take on life.Alice was hilarious. I believe she was my favorite part of this book. Her personality was delightfully stubborn, fierce, and exuberant. Some parts made me laugh out loud.Wesley- Batty\u2019s love interest was perfect for her. But then Birdsall got rid of him! GOT RID OF HIM! WHY?!! He was perfect for her! An artists, quiet, with subtle yet endearing mannerisms. By the end of the story I was disappointed that he was being removed so completely from the story.Jane was goofy and as random and distracted as ever. I love her, she\u2019s probably one of my favorite characters.Cons:Skye and Jeffrey don\u2019t get married.Jeffrey and Batty are thrown together.We don\u2019t see the wedding!!!The characters felt distant.I didn\u2019t get to see enough of the original Penderwicks.I feel so unsatisfied.-Last Words-Why Birdsall why??!! This is a sad sad day for the honest avocado. Who needs to buy table salt as a seasoning? Today I\u2019m going to salt my guacamole with my own tears.______________________________**My more moderate review...**First thoughts after reading this book. I gave it 3 stars because it had an unsatisfying conclusion (in my opinion) and didn't have the zest and adventure of the previous books.In fact, there was no major conflict driving the story which made it rather ....boring. I hate to give it only 3 stars because it's the Penderwicks, one of my all-time favorite series. However at the end of the day it fell short of my expectations. Of course my expectations were ridiculously high (I've been waiting for the end of the series to see who Jeffrey ends up with ever since book 1). This made me extremely melancholy. I didn't want to rate it 1 or 2 because it was a decent book, but by no means a satisfying conclusion. There were parts I enjoyed however, which I will cover in my longer review to come. In short it is just sad either way to part with the Penderwicks, but parting with them on these terms? Well...it's even harder. *longer review to come"}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57131764-lauren", "userReview": "I have heard almost no rumors about this book except that it is about Lydia and it takes place at Arundel (as one reviewer has previously stated).

It's only good I have written the end on my own for myself and all Skeffrey shippers in Wattpad, but now it's actually more confusing. This is my edited review.Actually, I could keep my review short and only say the truth: Whereas the first four Penderwicks books were essentially Little Women - Part 1 (okay, with some other inspirations sometimes), this very last Penderwicks book is a mix of Pride and Prejudice (Pins and threats) and Little Women part 2, but mostly the retelling of (at least) four chapters from Jo's boys (the final book of Alcott's Little Women series): Josie plays mermaid (8, the essential inspiration of mobiles, rocks, acted death scenes and embodiments;), The worm turns (9, dealing with the \"keep talking into marriage\"), Aslauga's knight (21) and Positively Last Appearance (22)- well, I guess this was inspiration for poor Wesley. Whoever thinks it would be only Little Women and thinks that would be the reason: It's not. I start with the good side: I do love Lydia! I hated the name because of ridiculous Lydia Bennet, but now I see a fith sister called Lydia totally different (Congratulations, Birdsall! This was your aim because minima optima est). It's now Little Women, Ben and Lydia (: Lydia was an awesome beginning in book 4, but now she's in the same age like Skye was in the very first book. Lydia is such a sweet, dancing character (aw, Swan Lake! But no one should imitate Lydia's Bolero performance). It's really hard for me to conclude a series with a favorite character who first appeared in book 4 as a baby! And I loved also that my predictions for the second girl on the cover was right! It's Alice, Cagney's daughter! Her comparison with Peter Pan is very fitting. The writing style is great: We get not only summer feelings, but also the beauty of spring time ( but with a bit too much colloquial phrases). There are some references to Little Women and Pride and Prejudice, but mostly it reminds me of Noel Streatfeild. We get a bunch of talented characters: dancing,movie making, singing and writing. Lydia reminded me of my favorite Disney fairy Prilla. And that Jeffrey was in Germany, was quite funny for me because I know it very well (:, and I liked the reference to Dresden, this beautiful city, the jazz center worldwide, was quite delighting because I like this place. What could I say more?bad: Yes, there are too many flaws and I hated all these points. First, it feels like a sequel or a standalone book. We rarely see our favorite characters. Too less, indeed. Especially Skye, who seemed to get excluded just to open the stage for Batty. There are new leading characters. And one character was a shock! We get to know Wesley, Batty's ex-boyfriend. Can you imagine that? If Batty was still the super-shy girl, treasuring only Jeffrey in her heart..I could understand at least. I liked Wesley and I wished he could stay and get together with Batty again or with Jane. I was actually sad for him because he was introduced as such a likeable character. My major problem is a bit of ( 9- years) gap between now and the last book. Apparently, a lot happened and I wished to witness the growth. It was just OMG and WTF. Please, Birdsall, how do you dare to skip? I'm not sure if Rosy fits to urban farming. Birdsall you can't start a book with Skye thinking about marrying a Czech guy called Dusek (I just remember it as a family name, which confused me). It's such a sweet idea having a marine biologist as a love interest for an astrophysician. He calls her star of the sea ( in Czech, so I had to translate). But honestly, Birdsall, you never mentioned Jeffrey's love for Skye or their shared memories at Arundel. I'm a Skeffrey shipper, but I couldn't demand it. But I wished Skye and Jeffrey would clear it then more. I am still thinking that there was a little open gate after book 4 for a possible wedding for Skye and Jeffrey. Otherwise there weren't so many fans waiting exited for this happening in the very last book and it's quite a shame that Birdsall handled this issue as if there would have never been a slightest thought of it. Read Point Mouette, chapter 16, and then you feel Skeffrey. And poor Jane - I always considered her as a girl longing for love and beauty, seems to be a suffragette spinster.Jane was always my favorite character and I spent the time waiting for the book, with thinking about the best match for Jane. I accept Batty as vegetarian, but why Jane? There isn't the tiniest walk-through for all our beloved side characters. Many characters, like Anna or Pearson dropped out, and we never again get something about them. Only Arundel is recalled, but other memories seem to be gone with the wind. Nick and Tommy appear in the end, but only so less that it was aching. I consider it as very bold to make Churchie move to Hawaii (hey, her grandchildren were used to live in Boston! Why Hawaii? Just to get sure that Churchie has no chance to appear at the wedding? A rarely stupid solution!).Birdsall writes only that Mrs. Tifton thinks that Skye was crushing on Jeffrey, but Jeffrey's crush on Skye wasn't mentioned.!!!! Alice says that her father Cagney told her that Batty kept talking about marrying Jeffrey at Arundel. First, Batty said that only once in the first book and only the original Penderwicks could know that secret. Neither Jeffrey nor Cagney could know it. The whole rescue activity wasn't mentioned again as background.Alice shows Lydia the famous hole in the hedge and tells Lydia about Jeffrey's crash with Skye. OK, perhaps Jeffrey has told her.Skye tells Lydia that Rosalind had crushed Cagney, when Skye and Rosalind arrive. Has Rosalind really told her sisters? And why would Skye tell?The nicknames Lyds and Bats are completely new and I couldn't get used to them. In the end, I got the feeling that Birdsall wanted that Beth and Laurie get together and take over Plumfield. Of course, the Penderwicks aren't Little Women, but whoever says that Batty is Amy - I don't believe it. And Jeffrey was for me more a perfect mixture of Laurie and Bhaer, perfect for tomboy Skye. The interaction between Batty and Laurie was for me the friendship between Beth and Mr. (James) Laurence. My idea was actually, that this last book isn't too close to Little Women because for me, Batty is not Amy, but Beth (Battymouse could refer to Beth's nickname \"Mouse\", shyness, animals, music, mourns a pet, a kind of \"sickness\", and also the sweet interaction with someone older...). In this last book, each sister seems to be based on Amy. For me, Jane is Jo ( funny, messy writer), and Skye is Amy (ambitious, neat). Skye is the tomboy of the family, and Jane is girlish, but this is the only change. Actually, the Jeffrey-Jane-Skye-relationship was for me Laurie-Jo-Amy because Skye and Laurie didn't like each other in the beginning, but Jane and Laurie were soon buddies. And because Jo thinks in Little Women that Beth would be in love with Laurie (Tender trouble) I thought that the Batty-foreshadowing would be a clever reference. But in this book all girls felt like Amy: Skye as the sister who travels and finds a match abroad (Surprises), Jo as the sister loving art (since when is Jane interested in artists like Degas or Rubens?), Batty as the sister who gets the boy (Learning to forget).My reasons for Skeffrey were 1) Skye had just flimsy excuses for rejecting Jeffrey: she wants to study first, she doesn't want to lose a friend, she is afraid of becoming a mother, and she can't change her brain (heart would be matter for love!). And Skye seemed to enjoy music in the previous books (apart from opera, but I never saw Jeffrey liking opera). And the Swan princess story: Odette rejects Derek because he only says that he loves her for being beautiful. She later accepts when Derek told her how smart and brave she is. And I considered this the very problem and solution for Skeffrey,And also according to Pride and Prejudice would be sensible: Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia could be seen easily as our 5 Penderwicks. And even Sense and Sensibility with Elinor for Skye and Marianne for Jane would fit very well. I really don't understand why Birdsall didn't learn from great classics, but deicded for the easiest solution. Some flaws are also that it isn't as bright and cozy as the previous books. It's actually darker although Lydia is very optimistic. I wished it would be a sequel. Arundel isn't the same. Yes, the estate is like a spooky,eerie enchanted castle. Do you remember when Batty (her nick name means little bat) was playing vampire and shouting blood!? Or Jane's play with the innocent blood? Birdsall seems to like horror. Blood is a little bit mentioned here again, but the more confusing point is one part with the imagined fate of Mrs. Tifton's ex-husbands and a certain ax. And Ben is making only movies with death scenes - poor alien!And it's too much about mobile phones. Actually, there is no chapter, no character without. And too many animals. Sorry, but what I can I expect from an author of \" My favorite pets\"? A child reading to sheep, of course! On the cover shouldn't be only one dog, but six ones, a sheep, chicken and spiders. It's Batty's story. And actually Birdsall's. The mentioning of birdcalls could be- as the books itself- a very long self-honouring of herself. And I didn't catch the wedding itself and it seemed to be omitted. The Penderwicks are a clever series beginning with Arundel, then Gardam Street, then Point Mouette, then Gardam Street, finally Arundel. 5 books, 5 sisters and Birdsall tried to give everyone a similar space to narrate.I give one star because it's for me a sequel and not a satisfying conclusion. The characters are different or unfamiliar - and it's a new tale. Yes, it feels like a fairy tale, like Sleeping Beauty (it's mentioned at least), with a 7 years age-gap between the young \"couple\", some good fairies and a wicked witch. It should be happy, with all the characters dancing and singing all the time like in a Disney movie, but then please without the open end. And it reminded me in the end more of Lalaland. A lulling, luring feel-good- musical, until you realize that it wasn't a happy end. The hero (Jeffrey) is a jazz pianist, the heroine (Skye) marries a random man because of course, it shouldn't work in reality. Actually, it feels like as if \"Harry Potter and the deathly hallows\"would be narrated with only Ginny's point of view. It's very odd to jump from character to youngest character in a series about growing-up characters. I don't mind the new point of views, but I missed the old ones.Summing up, the Penderwicks series is finished for me after Point Mouette. The Penderwicks in spring is a delighting story about the siblings Batty and Ben, and about Nick. (I see, how Batty was pushed to become more and more Amy, and how Skye was forced to reject). The Penderwicks at last is about Lydia. For me, Jeanne Birdsall showed that she is a children's book author who connects a lot of famous tropes and quotes, but she failed in understanding young adults. And look how many children reviewed the book... She is for me not a part of great literature, even if playing with Alcott, Austen and Shakespeare, and some other references I couldn't recognize. But each Penderwick book will find the way in the long hall of children classics, such as The Secret Garden, Pollyanna or Heidi. I loved her characters, but the last two books should have been standalone books. The Penderwicks are a truly special series, but for me, it was just too broken and jumpy to find a connection for the books.A last word: This book makes me think that all previous Penderwicks books were just a very long introduction to Lydia's tale. If the Penderwicks had not gone to Arundel, Mr. Penderwick had not married Iantha, and Lydia had not been born, we would have not her as protagonist. Perhaps I had different expectations and Birdsall did many surprising things. But actually, Birdsall could also have a weak memory...As a standalone, I would give 5 stars, perhaps, but still be sad for Wesley. But reading the previous books, a certain character would be missing.I recommend it only for Lydia's sake!"}, {"userName": "Rachael Stein", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5852865-rachael-stein", "userReview": "I will post a real review on the blog next week. For now, some stray thoughts. 1. Philippa Nel? That is a serious deep cut children's lit shout out, Jeanne. Nice. 2. I have found that I can't talk about this book out loud without crying. 3. Whoa what's with the Skye and Jeffrey shippers having tantrums here? O_o Settle tf down.Okay, here are some marginally more coherent thoughts: Lydia Penderwick, now eleven years old and just as exuberant as she was as a toddler in The Penderwicks in Spring, has heard tales of Arundel all her life. Now, as the Penderwick diaspora converges for a long-awaited wedding, she gets to experience the magical estate firsthand.18498292Jeanne Birdsall walks a tricky tightrope in The Penderwicks At Last. One one hand, she has been adamant from the beginning that this series will stay middle grade, and that each entry in the series will focus on the characters that make it a middle grade book. This will be no Anne of Green Gables, following its original protagonist well into adulthood. On the other hand, the readers of the series are devoted to the four older sisters and deeply invested in their various fates. Will Skye marry Jeffrey?! (There are apparently some people on Goodreads who feel VERY STRONGLY about this.) Will Batty marry Jeffrey? (That one has been my daughter's and my prediction since the beginning.) Will Skye become an astrophysicist?Setting the book at Arundel is a elegant way to solve the problem. Seeing a familiar place through new eyes provides a way to balance the narrative between past and present, and a wedding is a classic narrative device for assembling the whole cast of characters. And they are indeed assembled: Aunt Claire and Turon; Alec and his new dog (RIP Hoover); gardener Cagney (now a paterfamilias). Even Mrs. Tifton is (hilariously) along for the ride.Birdsall provides enough resolution of old tensions and strong hints about future plans to satisfy fans, while keeping the focus firmly on Lydia and her concerns. Most of the drama with the older Penderwicks sisters takes place in the background, filtered through Lydia's perspective. Meanwhile, the iconic places in Arundel are recognizable, but often changed. There are sheep in the field of the enormous bull who almost trampled Batty, and the manicured lawns have been turned into meadows where bobolinks (and eleven-year-olds) can hide.There are new inhabitants as well - mainly Cagney's family, with whom Lydia spends most of her time - but also, oddly, Batty's ex-boyfriend and his amazing three-legged great dane. It can be a risky proposition to introduce new characters in a series finale, but the new additions are as well-drawn as the old favorites. (One minor quibble: the Kirkus review mentioned the default whiteness of the book and series, and that is certainly true, but I was more disappointed by the heteronormativity. I had really headcanoned Skye as a lesbian, and possibly on the asexual spectrum. So there, Skeffrey shippers.)The novel is as much a meditation on time as anything else. Birdsall seems to understand that we want Arundel and the Penderwicks to stay the same forever (I honestly can't even talk about this book out loud without crying), but she won't let them remain in stasis. Like Lydia, we have to prance, leap, and gambol into the future."}, {"userName": "Juny", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35720467-juny", "userReview": "I don't even know what to rate this book...\"I'm not happy Bob, NOT HAPPY.\" -Incredibles.Jeanne Birdsall, you have leeet mee down! I still had hope for Skeffery in the begining but halfway through once Jeffery showed up I had lost hope basically. From then on I thought about stabbing a big old knife through the book in rage. I also felt like throwing up and thought that maybe I could rip out just the pages with Batty and Jeffery together because I did enjoy some of the other parts. Maybe the worse part about this book was it was so well done that it completely ripped my heart out.  Overall it was sort of a sad recap of the first book shown through Lydia's eyes. It still had that laugh out loud humor that I really enjoyed, though I would've enjoyed it a thousand more times if it didn't end the way that it did. I'm actually kind of mad at Skye!

Skye has now dropped considerably lower on my favorite list, and I'm just hoping that when I re-read the first 4 Penderwicks I can forget the atrocities that have happened in this book. It made me really sad to see all the original Penderwicks all grown up but with the wrong people, except for Rosalind. Like when they all played soccer together happy sad moment (especially since Jeffery didn't even play later on but sat on the side lines with Batty). The last MOPS meeting, ugh, why!!!! I would rather have had this book not even have been written. The last scene with the tunnel, aghh! It was so well done, it wrapped up so nicely, in that aspect, that it just is saaaad. Also Jack and Lydia in the future probably won't get married because according to Jeanne Birdsall logic, just because two kids bump into each other in a secret tunnel in a hedge and meet each other and become best friends, literally best friends, and are so good together and everything was set up like they were going to be together....That does not mean they will get married in the future. Thanks a lot for the disappointment."}, {"userName": "Grace", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38664674-grace", "userReview": "WhyyyyyyyyI can't give this a rating because, objectively, it was a nice, fun book... but subjectively.... well, let's just say that it definitely did not satisfy seven years worth of expectations.Here's the good:-Lydia. I liked her as a narrator much more than I expected to. She has her own unique personality that's different from any of the other Penderwick siblings and I love it!-Alice and Lydia's friendship. Alice was another great character (Cagney's daughter!!) and her relationship with Lydia was the best.-Batty's little spider rescue operations-Just Cagney's whole family. His wife. His kids. All of his chickens. A+-THE FUCKING CHICKENS. HATSHEPSUT!! -...Mrs. Tifton. Which is weird. But she was an oddly sympathetic character in this book. Idk.-The ending with Lydia running into Jack under the hedge :)))))-The little callback to the first book where Lydia sees the urn and she's like \"huh, I wonder if that could hide an 11 year old girl...\" I see what you did there, Ms. Birdsall-Wesley's comment at the end that lowkey implies that Jane wrote the Penderwicks seriesAnd here's the bad (or more like, \"the frustrating\")...-Having just one narrator. As a mentioned, I loved Lydia, but all of the other books had at least 2 narrators and with this once just having 1, it felt like we lost a lot of the story, since we only got Lydia's perspective-The lack of older sisters/OG characters like Jeffrey, Tommy, Nick, Mr. Penderwick, Iantha... they're all mentioned a lot, but they don't really DO anything. Which was frustrating-How the wedding was treated... it felt like the whole book was leading up to this huge double wedding, and then there's not even a scene with the wedding?? WTF??-The complete and utter LACK OF RESOLUTION surrounding the Skye and Jeffrey conflict from the previous book. From what we knew before, Jeffrey was madly in love with Skye, she didn't reciprocate his feelings because she wanted to focus on her education, but they were still best friends. Now, here we are with Jeffrey being seemingly uninterested in Skye and Skye being in a committed (and then married??) relationship with some random Czech guy she started dating WHILE SHE WAS STILL IN COLLEGE (what happened to focusing on that education, Skye?). Also, there is no mention if Skye and Jeffrey are still best friends, and honestly, it doesn't seem like they are. They have about one conversation the entire book. Which is weird. And sad. And frustrating.-A follow-up to the last one, but Skyffrey?? Where was it?? The past four books and the past seven years of my life have been very clearly leading up to the culmination of this one stupid fictional relationship and I don't even get it?? Instead, I get Skye marrying some fucking marine biologist from the Czech Republic in a spur of the moment decision (which the OG Skye would have NEVER agreed to, by the way. But more on that later) and then there's Jeffrey, soon to be in a relationship with... bATTY?? WTF WTF THAT'S SO WRONG. Even if Skye and Jeffrey weren't going to get together, why would he get together with BATTY? They clearly have a brother/sister relationship and seeing as Jeffrey first met her when she was FOUR, the whole romantic thing is, quite frankly, a bit creepy. I mean, COME ON. Even Mrs. Tifton predicted Skyffrey!!! Why! Did! It! Not! Happen!!!-Also, Batty very clearly had feelings for Wesley?? So...???-A LOT of the characters were very... out of character. Rosalind and Tommy publicly making out in front of young children?? Rosalind WOULD NEVER do that. NEVER. Skye blushing because Douchehead calls her his shooting star or some crap like that? SHE WOULD NEVER. Skye agreeing to A. get married with B. about two week's notice?? Listen. Skye needed a solid two months to prepare to go to Maine without her parents and Rosalind. She would never agree to get married, first of all, much less with only two weeks to prepare for it. Overall, this was probably my biggest complaint about the book- how out of character everyone seemed to be. It felt like these were new characters I had never met before, not the ones I've been reading for seven years.Despite my issues with this book, this series will forever hold a special place in my heart. I truly feel that I wouldn't be who I am today without these books and I thank Jeanne Birdsall for creating this wonderful family.But Skyfrrey!!

Lydia, the youngest Penderwick, is eleven years old, and is thrilled to finally visit the magical place that has been the subject of so many stories told by her now grown-up sisters, who range in age from 19 (Batty) to 27 (Rosalind). While wedding preparations unfold around her, Lydia befriends Alice, the daughter of Cagney Pelletier and his wife, Natalie, and the two girls do such things as flee from nosy Mrs. Tifton, whom Jeffrey did not consult before offering Arundel for the wedding, babysit the dog of Batty's ex-boyfriend, and take care of some chickens.When I first read The Penderwicks nearly ten years ago, I gave it a very enthusiastic five stars. Here was a timeless book about sisters having adventures together, solving their own problems, and mostly looking out for one another. It was my exact cup of tea and I drank it down eagerly. The following sequels varied in quality: I liked The Penderwicks on Gardam Street, but found The Penderwicks at Point Mouette too contrived, and then enjoyed The Penderwicks in Spring, but felt it didn't match the tone of the first three books. This final book, however, is the biggest disappointment of the four sequels, and it sends the series out not with a bang, but with a whimper.The biggest problem, I think, is with the original four characters. In every book of the series prior to this one, one of the original four girls has still been young enough to take center stage as the protagonist of the story. Readers feel at home in those books because even though the characters are a bit older in each new title, readers have built up a relationship with those characters over the course of the series and have a vested interest in learning what happens to them. Because those beloved characters are now all adults in this book, they are suddenly just not that interesting. They all have adult worries about careers and marriage that kids just don't care about, and we are no longer inside any of their heads.Worse, because they have been kids in the previous books, their adult selves feel very hollow and inauthentic, as though only the most stereotypical vestiges of their personalities actually followed them to adulthood. I kept thinking about those obligatory sit-com episodes in which the characters imagine what they will be like in the future. The actors get dressed up as older versions of themselves, utter a few catchphrases from beneath their fake white wigs and everybody laughs at how silly they look and sound. As I read passages about the older Penderwick girls, I kept finding myself thinking that each one felt like she was pretending to be an adult and not doing a very believable job of it. In that sense, reading this book was like reading a book-length Harry Potter epilogue.The other big problem, unfortunately, is with Lydia. She only made her first appearance in the fourth book, in which she was only two years old, and she is completely unknown to the reader at the start of this book. While she does have some qualities that supposedly set her apart from the other Penderwicks, such as the fact that she supposedly likes everybody she meets, these are mostly superficial and do nothing to develop her as anything other than the vehicle by which the reader is able to check in on Rosalind, Skye, Jane, and Batty as adults. She essentially spends the whole book trying to recapture what her sisters have told her about Arundel and asking questions meant to remind readers of events that have gone before. (This is especially weird because at every opportunity Batty claims not to remember things, like wearing wings, that I think most average people would remember from their childhoods.)Without a strong main character, and with the four original characters off to the sidelines posing as grown-ups, there is nothing to distract the reader from the usual tropes that appear in the other books of this series, which, in the past, have been made less annoying by the book's other good qualities. These include Mrs. Tifton's utterly stereotypical and incredible continuing disdain for the Penderwicks after essentially not seeing them for fifteen years, the sheer number of unnecessary characters, including Alice's brother and a host of dogs whose names are impossible to keep straight, and the last-minute decision by one of the other sisters to also get married along with Rosalind. Also problematic is the fact that the book spends all its time building up to a wedding, and then not one word is written about the actual wedding ceremony. I also absolutely hated the references to the \"patriarchy.\" That gave the book a political flavor that was decidedly absent from the others of the series, and which is grossly inappropriate for the 8-to-12-year-old audience.All in all, this book is just one story too many about these characters. While it is nice to know what happened to them all as adults, it is not necessary to devote an entire book to explaining it. Honestly, a single chapter at the end of the fourth book which described the wedding would have done the trick - that even could have been from Lydia's point of view and it would have been a fun novelty instead of the major liability it is for this book. It was an interesting idea to have the characters age so much from book to book, especially since so many years went by between books, but I also think there is a reason more authors don't take this approach. This fizzling out at the end of the series was almost inevitable, simply because kids want to read about kids, not nostalgic adults who used to be the kids they loved to read about.This review also appears on my blog, Read-at-Home Mom."}, {"userName": "Brandy Painter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2840210-brandy-painter", "userReview": "4.5 starsOriginally posted here at Random Musings of a Bibliophile.The Penderwicks at Last by Jeanne Birdsall is the fifth and final installment of the series that began with The Penderwicks: The Summer Tale of Four Sisters, Two Rabbits, and a Very Interesting Boy back in 2005. I awaited its release with equal parts excitement and trepidation. It's always hard to face the end of a favorite series, especially when one has developed Opinions about the characters and their destinies. I'm happy to report I was quite satisfied with the way Birdsall wrapped everything up. It is not anywhere close to my favorite book in the series, but it fulfills its purpose as a final volume well and is still quite excellent.Most of the Penderwick children are grown and out of the house. Rosy and Jane both have apartments in their hometown. Skye is in Californian working on her post graduate degree. Batty is finishing up her first year at college in Boston. Honorary Penderwick Jeffrey has spent the last few years in Germany working on his music. Ben and Lydia are the only ones left at home. Ben is a teenager who want to be the next great Hollywood director. Lydia is a born dancer, moving through life to her own rhythm and the choreography in her head. The family is coming together again at Arundel where everything began to celebrate Rosie's wedding to her childhood sweetheart. Lydia and Batty are the first two Penderwicks. to travel down to begin preparations. Lydia is filled with wonder and excitement at the prospect of exploring and experiencing the place she has heard of only through stories. Her adventures start with meeting Alice whose parents are part time care takers of Arundel. Her father is the famous Cagney who owned the rabbits famous in the stories Lydia has heard. Things only get more exciting as the dreaded Mrs. Tifton appears unexpectedly, Batty's ex-boyfriend gets stranded while delivering gifts, and the Penderwicks are in for a last minute wedding surprise they hadn't planned for.It was a brilliant idea to end the story where it began and to bring Cagney and Mrs. Tifton back into it after so many years of their absence. Arundel works really well for the setting and it is delightful to discover it through Lydia's fresh eyes. Lydia is open and compassionate. The family jokes that she has never met a person she doesn't like. Lydia steadfastly likes to bring up the two times that wasn't true. The family is proven correct though when Lydia shockingly becomes the one Penderwick Mrs. Tifton not only stands but actually seeks out and seems to enjoy. Alice is a perfect foil for Lydia. More prickly and capable of holding grudges, she is in a competition with her older brother who is visiting Canada to prove who is having a better time during their summer. Arundel is just as chaotic. Cagney has traded rabbits for chickens named for historical Egyptians. There are more dogs present in this story. And as soon as the Penderwicks plus Jeffrey are reunited the regress and begin acting like children again. Soccer balls everywhere, music constantly performed, and everyone trying to out talk the others.Birdsall finds ways of bringing out the characteristics w'eve come to love and appreciate in all the siblings over the years while aging them (mostly) well. Fans of the series will know what happens to all of their favorites. Many will be happy to know that Jeffrey has matured quite a lot and it shows. He is calm and patient, dealing with his mother firmly but lovingly. Batty shines with all of the realized promise of the previous book. Rosy is deliriously happy. Jane is working hard but hasn't stopped dreaming. Skye has done everything she set out to do with her life so far and managed to surprise even herself by ending up neck deep in love. (Skye in love is a delightful revelation.)I think fans of the series will be pleased with this final installment. Birdsall wrapped things up while also leaving aspects of the future open to the imagination and wondering."}, {"userName": "Maya", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20362530-maya", "userReview": "so i guess that went how i, in my heart of hearts, knew it was going to go. not the way i wanted it to go, of course. because we could never allow that. but i've read little women, so i guess i saw it coming. i will say this wasn't as much of a dumpster fire as the last book. although jeanne could never write a dumpster fire, it was about as close as you could get. spring was just a rough time. that book was pure pain, this book was like pain but pain when you've had the wound for three years and it pretty much just hurts when it rains. and it happened to be raining today. ya know. still not pleasant, though. eventually i will let my mind explain it away into what i want it to be, or just eliminate this and spring from my brain forever. because really, the ones that changed me were the first three. let's be real. it's also weird though because i can read my reviews of these books and remember reading them in all the years of my life and each time i think differently. this one made me feel weird and grown-up. first, because i got bored reading the in between stuff about the film-making and arundel-exploring, because, unlike lydia, i have been there before. the fact that i can't totally immerse myself in that anymore makes me kinda sad-- or maybe she didn't write it well enough. let's say that. also, i didn't like alice and didn't have enough time to get to know the narrator, lydia, as who she was to love her dearly. i think that was one of my issues with batty in the last one, even though she had been there since the beginning, i wasn't used to her voice at all. also, time jumps always throw me off because there's been so much character development that the reader hasn't witnessed so the characters are usually strange and unfamiliar in some ways. i had fallen so in love with the voices of my dear three eldest sisters that i think it's really hard to create that kind of attachment and love in only one book, nine years apart from the others, when it had been done before in three consecutively occurring books. me, being the almost-adult i am now, recognizes that the things you want in your childhood more often than not do not end up coming true, and you just gotta face the harsh realities of life sometimes, and go where life takes you and just be happy with it and happy remembering the good times. change is hard to accept. the fact that i am even acknowledging this in a review is a rarity and not at all like me so yes i am growing up! stop it! ok that's enough adulting. i said it, now im going to act like a kid again and tell u everything i wanted and that did or didn't happen and my raw reaction to it! okay. first of all it was also a very weird feeling to see these girls be getting married! i had gone from being their age in the first book, to being their age in the second and third books, and then being older than them. and all of a sudden, they are like ten years older than me? and i remember their whole childhood and now they are adults getting married? so what does that make me? confused!! another thing: we didn't need all these new characters! cagney was weird and responsible and an adult with kids..nick (in his one sentence-mention glory) is also an adult married with kids! who are these randos ur marrying?? speaking of marrying randos, who is this MAN skye is choosing to spend the rest of her LIFE with and we only met him for ONE book and have NO idea about his character or anything, literally just his name and occupation. and his one line of dialogue. okay. sounds fake but okay. the whole double wedding thing just seemed really abrupt and unnecessary. like it would have been okay to just have rosy and tommy be getting married and then skye just be dating this dude. (this leaves more room for my head to explain it away) i could deal with that. but No! and agh it's so weird introducing as characters children who weren't born when the first 3 books took place: lydia, alice, jack, turron & claire's twins, and all these Random Ass dogs who i could not keep straight for the life of me. it's a lot of too-rapid character development that doesn't totally work in my mind. I wanted some wedding footage though! not of skye and her dude but of rosalind and tommy! this is something that makes sense to me! and it's so damn cute! since high school eeee. that's how it should go,,, meg and john brooke....ok...,,,, but it was sweet! their moments in gardam street were so cute and so i like how that came to fruition in this book. ALTHO i wanted more from both rosy AND tommy! is it like the thing where when you get too old you can't come to narnia anymore? and you have to face life and no longer be the narrators of children's books because your thoughts are too complex? i just wanted more face time. more from tommy, i wanted more from..OH YEAH let's address the elephant in the room: batty and jeffrey. yes. i see you. it's not as weird as i orginally thought BUT IT'S STILL REALLY WEIRD BC I CLEARLY REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS 5 AND HE WAS ELEVEN. that is a big difference. especially when they are starting this whole romance thing when she's nineteen. nineteen! as in, a teenager! only a small amount older than me! so strange! i mean i guess he's still the jeffrey i know and love with all my heart but..something is different? i also wanted more from the ultimate bae, alec! and turron! the bros! honestly i needed more mouette references. that book was fantastic! i need dominic showing up at the wedding and wreaking havoc. i don't need wesley, the stranger, and the 50,000th dog in the book. i want burning wishes! i want there's nothing sadder than a one man woman, looking for the man who got away! i want freaking churchie! how hard! hawaii, come on! there were so many really great characters already that we could have had instead of this whole new cast of characters. what about melissa and pierce from book two? Lol! and mick hart! i want a seal reference! and the penderwick ex-boyfriend talk? straight up where was the dominic reference. come on. that's gold. the poem, ode to a kiss? dancing with popsicle sticks!! SABRINA STARR??? also it made me sad that they couldn't stay in the cottage because cagney's family lived there. that is not so hard to accomplish. mrs. tifton also acted weird in this book. and im sorry but dexter was a more developed character than any of the newbies in this book and he doesn't get a single mention? justice for dexter! ugh. i don't know. i guess it's time to grow up :( but before i do that im gonna do the same thing i always do when reviewing the finale of a series: say goodbye. and thank you. this is one of the biggest thank yous i have, next to harry potter. this book is special in a different way because it isn't super well known, so it was just a thing with me, my sister, and one of my friends. the penderwicks have been a part of my life for such a long time it's almost as if they are my family. in the time i have been reading these books i've graduated middle school, started high school, learned to drive, kissed a boy, got my first job, visited colleges, and so much more. thank you, penderwicks for being there thru it all. u some real ones. ya changed me, my Bs. and i will probably keep coming back to those first three books for years and years to come, because they remind me of my childhood and all the reasons i have to be happy. lots of love,maya pre review!! because uughhh u don't knoowww how long ive been waiting for this. basically, my whole life. guys. i started reading these books when i was nine probably?? and i'll be almost 17 when it comes out. hOLY shitballs! that's eight years. nearly a decade of me loving the penderwicks. ok. this and harry potter, the books that shaped me the most in my life. so i guess im saying? it betta be good, jeanne! (and by good.. u know what i want. u KnoW what i need!! u know what louisa may alcott FAILED to give me!!) . ...jo. + laurie. skye. + jeffrey. b, please don't let me down. i've waited eight years. that is a long fucking time. god, i am ready for aLL the feels. eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"}, {"userName": "Kaethe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe", "userReview": "Aaaahhhhh. Very drawn-out sigh of satisfaction. I have just finished the fifth and final Penderwick novel. Previously I had noted how very old-fashioned the books felt: a sort of 20th-century nevertime with cars and phones and computers, but in which plot rarely if ever includes them. I mention this because it was less true in Penderwicks in Spring, and not true at all in Penderwicks at Last. No one watches tv still, but camera phones are integral.One of the most satisfying conclusions I\u2019ve ever read. Birdsall doesn\u2019t try to tie up every last end, but she does suggest how the future might go. The reader is free to pick the path they like best. A note on characterization: I like the adults Birdsall creates. She manages to keep them offstage in order for the kids to have freedom, but she does it without ever suggesting that they are neglectful. The emphasis, and the attention, and the really painstaking work goes into making the children vibrant and real and plausible. Well, okay, some of the attention goes to the critters, and oh! for fans of the dogs, this is a rich book indeed.Heretofore I have reserved the Beloved shelf for books I have read and adored at least twice.

So what you're going to get is rambly, somewhat incoherent gushing and thoughts that might not even make sense to people who have also read this series. But I have to talk about it! After all, this was probably my most anticipated finale since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came out. I even went to the trouble to buy the e-book since amazon notified me that my pre-ordered copy won't get here until May 30th. What the heck, amazon? I debated waiting, but then again, why not support one of my favorite authors by buying something that costs less than a weeks meals at university? I can easily skip some of those to make up for it...Anyway, needless to say, I loved this book. It's probably my least favorite of the series, but that doesn't change the fact that I adored it. So here are some of my first thoughts: beware of spoilers, obviously... - I throughly enjoyed Lydia as the focalizer of this story. She has grown so much since The Penderwicks in Spring, yet her personality still reminded me of the little girl who loved tiaras and spoke of herself in the third person. I love how she loves dancing, but hates dance classes, how she keeps trying to convince people that she does not, in fact, like everybody, and how she complains to Alice about Ben making her die in all his movies. I loved her interactions with her sisters: how she was worried that Skye would ask her about math during their phone call (which, of course, Skye did :) ), how Ben doesn't want her to spend the night with him but can be bribed into doing it with recording equipment, how she tries to stay neutral so that she doesn't hurt Batty by allowing Wesley to stay, and of course, how she bosses her family around to learn the wedding choreography. The spider incident was hilarious. Lydia is just so fun, but shows all the indignation of being treated as the youngest sibling. Iantha keeps asking if she's homesick away at Arundel, Jane won't let her listen to her conversation with Ms. Tifton... I guess that's the annoying burden of being the youngest. Lydia had such a unique, but Penderwicky personality that I can't help but admire how Jeanne Birdsall does it. Her characters are so real, so wonderful, it's just always a joy to read these books. As does the excellent writing that just conveys so well how the world looks to a child. - Lydia's and Alice's friendship is GOALS. I loved how they tried to convince each other that it would be okay not to like each other and that they weren't really that nice because they didn't want their families forcing them to be friends. It's so great that Cagney was brought back into the story by introducing his family, it brings everything to such a full circle (also - Lydia bumping into Jack when she leaves the tunnel is just such a beautiful mirror scene to when Skye first meets Jeffrey...). Plus, reading Alice in Wonderland to a sheep doesn't sound half bad. Maybe I should try it sometime... And I'd love a secret hideout in a Bobolink Meadow. The picture wars with Jack were hilarious - I can definitely relate to sending my siblings pictures to try to make them jealous ;) (I did think, however, that there was a huge jump in the use of technology between books - I kind of wish there had been less of an emphasis). I also completely related to Alice not having any nice dresses or shoes for the wedding and hating having to go shopping instead of meeting Lydia's cousins. Finally someone who gets how terrible shopping for clothes is! I do not understand why some people list it as a hobby... I also throughly enjoyed all the scenes in which Ben, Alice, and Lydia were making their alien movie. - Before I read this, one of my biggest fears was that Skye wouldn't end up with Jeffrey. I loved them together (even though part of my brain always said that Batty and Jeffrey had much more in common and would fit the Little Women scheme) and Skye is my absolute favorite Penderwick. I mean, she is a blond tomboy who loves math. She is one of the book characters I see myself in the most. And I still think that Skye and Jeffrey would also have made a good couple. But Du\u0161ek! Even though we didn't see that much of him, I absolutely adore him! The line \"He'd come to the United States to study marine biology and found Skye studying the stars, and they'd been together ever since\" (Birdsall 16) already made me fall in love. He's a scientist! And marine biology at that (I was absolutely obsessed with it during middle school..) And he loves Skye for all her nerdiness. He called her his \"morning star\" (Yes, I translated the Czech bits...)! Skye learnt Czech for him. The Penderwick family clearly loves him. And Skye and Jeffrey are still great friends. I loved that Jeffrey and Jane immediately challenged Skye to a soccer battle when she arrived at Arundel. The old times! (I also love how Rosalind's comment on that was \"Instant regression\" (Birdsall 189)). And I really love how Skye is just happy and has become a lot less hard on herself. It's also fascinating to see the way Lydia describes Skye now in comparison to how her sisters described her in the earlier books. - Jane is on her third full-length novel! Honestly, I would read that. A detective hunting a time-traveling art forger - that sounds exciting! Though honestly, I love Jane so much I would also read every single Sabrina Starr book... Also - does anyone else think Wesley's comment at the end might be a hint that Jane wrote the Penderwicks series? - The Oliver references were hilarious! Thank God he's become a Penderwick legend. It must be a high honor to be one of only two people ever that Lydia didn't like. Though, honestly, I would love to know more about Deborah. It's sounds like there's still such an interesting story behind this. - This is the first book that I actually related to Ms. Tifton. Who would have thought? She just seemed so sad. I think she's come to realize what she had with Alec, which is why she doesn't want to run into him. She's to ashamed of what happened and probably the opportunities she's lost. Maybe that's why she wants to arrange everything for Jeffrey - if everything's planned out, she can spare him the heartbreak she had to go through (at least, that's what she thinks). She must be devastated about all her unhappy marriages, which is why she does try to do something to make the Penderwicks' nice. I feel almost bad that Rosalind and Skye didn't wear the veils. It's so sad how she hints at the fact that she's sad about not being invited to the wedding. I kind of wanted Jane to invite her right then and there... I also love the relationship between Ms. Tifton and Lydia. It's funny how the older Penderwicks were always so scared of Ms. Tifton and somehow that stuck, but Lydia just doesn't find her frightening. I think Lydia is starting to see how sad Ms. Tifton really is and I was kind of disappointed that we didn't see more of this storyline. And I would have loved to see her and Alec meet! -I really like Jeffrey and Batty together. I always loved the mentor-mentee relationship they had and their shared love for music. I just never really wanted them to like each other romantically because I was always rooting for Jeffrey and Skye. But with Du\u0161ek in the picture and Skye clearly happy, I really like this relationship (although I think that scene when Jeffrey saw Batty in a dress and thought she was Rosalind bordered on being too cheesy). I just kind of wish this hadn't been left at the open ending and we really got confirmation. Like a flash-forward to another wedding, where Ms. Tifton is in the picture and Batty is wearing one of the veils? Maybe that would have been over-the-top. But still. Is there really not going to be another book? Maybe? There was so much unresolved stuff... But no, I guess I'd better not say that - look what happened the last time I wished for another book in a favorite series of mine...- All the families were great! So many favorites now have families (like Nick, for example) and I also liked finally getting to see Marty and Enam, even if briefly. I was intrigued ever since Mr. Penderwick threatened to buy them drum sets in The Penderwicks in Spring. Who knows? Maybe Turron isn't the only influence on them being in a band...- I feel bad for Wesley, though. He seems like such a nice guy. That story on how he rescued Hitch? Him making all those personalized mobiles and figures for the Penderwicks and Alice? He was just so adorable. And how he knew what would ultimately make Batty happy? But still, he probably got the outcome that was ultimately the right one for him, too. I hope he has an amazing life in Oregon. - Natalie is such a cool mom. The alien costume was such a hit!- There was one thing that I missed a little in this book, which is probably why it's not my favorite of the series: I wish there had been more of the family aspect in it. We barely got to see any of Mr. Penderwick and Iantha and not much of the older three sisters, either. I do see the point in giving Lydia her voice, since she hasn't had the chance to be a central character yet. And I do see that some of the private scenes between her older sisters wouldn't be witnessed by or pondered about by Lydia. But I wish we could have gotten to see more of the family dynamics between all the siblings and parents - I think those are the main reason I love these books so much. Since this was the final book, I really wish some of my other favorite characters had been in it more.- There also wasn't as much drama in this book as in the other ones. Especially Skye and Jane always had a real knack for getting into problems (rescuing Jeffrey, the Aztecs, the firegod,...). Lydia didn't get into any scrapes like that, which made for a bit less excitement than in the other ones.- The MOPS at the end was great! That had to happen one last time, even if it wasn't as secret as the Penderwicks might have hoped. And I loved the argument that the siblings had about whether Jeffrey had ever attended a MOPS before. Especially how interested the sisters were when they learned that Jeffrey and Ben had a boy MOPS once.- Why didn't we see the actual wedding? I would have loved to - this was distancing me from the Penderwicks much too fast. I still need this family in my life! I don't know how I'm going to survive the fact that this is really the last one in the series...Anyway, these are a few of my first thoughts. Who knows - maybe when my physical copy gets here and I've done a thorough re-read, I'll write a proper review.

It was slightly disappointing, for many reasons. I liked how they had their wedding at Arundel, but why didn't Batty remember? Also, WHO IN THE WORLD IS DUSEK????? He just pops up out of NOWHERE!!! OK, he and Skye were kinda cute but... Skye and Jeffery would have been cuter. I was so disappointed that they didn't work out. Also, where did BATTY AND JEFFERY come from??? He's like, 6 years older than her. Slightly weird, because when he was in college she was just starting middle school. The adventurous side felt a little rushed, and the bittersweet, sappy side that I loved so much in The Penderwicks In Spring was almost nonexistent. Ben was super cute, though. I like how he wanted to become a director, that is what I expected to happen. Also, I LOVED how she slipped Cagney into the mix, and with his kids nonetheless. All in all, it was a good story... but how harry potter would have been good if he hadn't found the Resurrection Stone and/or hadn't married Ginny and married some other obscure woman."}, {"userName": "Kathie", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9985756-kathie", "userReview": "Sigh...what a wonderful end to one of my all-time favorites series.

I feel like this series peaked in book three. This was not a particularly satisfying conclusion for me. It was kind of all over the place. Let's talk about romance-- I was rooting for Skye and Jeffrey. I thought they were a sure thing throughout the first three books. Then the fourth book came along, and it seemed like Birdsall was setting us up for Batty and Jeffrey, which I found uncomfortable because she was practically a baby when they met... I couldn't shake the \"little sister\" feel. And hadn't the narrative been setting us up for Skye and Jeffrey in the earlier books? I usually have a good read on these things. But hey, I'm a hopeless romantic, and if something is written well enough, I'll get on board with it! So, the scene in this book where Jeffrey arrives and sees Batty in Rosalind's wedding gown? Beautifully written and TOTALLY ROMANTIC. I liked that they had the same ringtone, too- cute! Like, okay, I'm good with this! I will follow where the author leads us! But then... the narrative just sort of shifted away from any particular focus on them. Batty made a few possibly-snarky remarks about Jeffrey being paired up with Marlene by his mom, so it seemed like the narrative was going to build to some romantic tension where they\u2019re forced to confront their feelings for each other- jealous Batty?- or maybe jealous Jeffrey when Wesley came calling?- but Birdsall just totally dropped any of that fun/dramatic potential. And then in the end, we are told through a convo between Lydia and Jane that Batty and Jeffrey will probably get married in 7-8 years. I mean, does Batty have anything to say about all this? It\u2019s presented as if she\u2019s almost oblivious to the romantic potential, and everyone\u2019s just deciding for her. She\u2019s fresh off of a serious breakup, so I can\u2019t imagine that she could have been confiding in her sisters about a sudden desire to marry Jeffrey, so why is Jane talking about it like it\u2019s a done deal? Hm. I get that we\u2019re seeing the romance develop through an 11-year-old\u2019s limited perspective, but sheesh. Birdsall more or less sold me on the Batty/Jeffrey pairing with that swoony wedding dress scene, left me wanting more, and then didn't deliver.ALSO on the subject of dropped subplots, why did Birdsall bring up the thing about Mrs. Tifton taking away Jeffrey\u2019s fortune if he marries a Penderwick\u2026 and then do absolutely nothing with that? If this was supposed to be the last book, she really left some serious strings untied. Hello, I wanted to see Jeffrey standing up to his mom for the sake of his Penderwick true love, sheesh. Furthermore! Why don\u2019t we get to know Skye\u2019s Dusek? All we got to see him do was say some swoony stuff in Czech. Which I liked, but I wanted to fall in love with him too. Skye was such a pivotal character in the earlier books\u2026 couldn\u2019t Birdsall have spent a little more time developing her future husband? Instead of maybe all the business about dogs and sheep? (Sooo much about dogs and sheep in this book.) Okay, enough about romance. I did like Alice\u2019s ongoing texting war with her brother. The constant one-upping was funny and cute, and I could see Jack coming into Lydia\u2019s life from a mile away. I liked that a lot- it was a fully-developed, Penderwick-ish subplot. The subplot about the alien film was cute, although I felt like it didn\u2019t really go anywhere significant. I was expecting some kind of hullabaloo with the dogs and the alien costume and maybe the chickens busting in on the wedding or something, but all we got was\u2026. Natalie made the costume, they filmed the final scene, and Alice did a good job? Where's the conflict? I thought it was really amusing that Mrs. Tifton actually liked or tolerated Lydia, even though Lydia did not like her. That was fun and funny. I liked that the older sisters still jump right into soccer games. I liked that Cagney was back, with a family. I liked Jane and her old car and her continuing writing career. There were things I liked about this book, I swear-- I know I sound soooo grumpy. It pains me that I didn't wholeheartedly love this book, because the beginning of the series was SO GOOD. I wanted to love the end.
