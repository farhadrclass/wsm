Each chapter is a short story of Stitch trying to complete a \"good deed\" in order for the \"Chitama Stone\" to grant his wish of being the \"strongest in the universe\" but, as expected, it turns out to be Stitch getting in trouble and Yuna trying to make things right. And the art is so beautiful!But if you are team Lilo & Stitch forever and always, do not worry because this manga also contains Lilo stories! And they are also extremely adorable!I would recommend this to everyone, no matter how old you are, who likes this Disney movies & loves the cutest alien on Earth!"}, {"userName": "Jenan", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49369188-jenan", "userReview": "Kids will enjoy this more than adults.

While it is obviously written for a younger audience, the story is still an enjoyable read. While the story actually takes Stitch away from Hawaii to an island in Japan, the book still retains much of the charm and fun of the movie it pulls its characters from. The book has Stitch meeting a character named Yuna and undertaking tasks in order to fulfill his wish of being the strongest in the Universe. Unfortunately, in his usual fashion, Stitch ends up getting into trouble while his new found \"cousin\" Yuna tries to fill Lilo's shoes/slippers by keeping things from getting out of hand. Although Stitch and Yuna are teamed up in this book, Lilo also makes an appearance as well.Though aimed towards a younger audience, the story thread is solid throughout the book. The art - while favorably comparable to other manga/manhwa being produced - does fall short of the more refined finished product of the original film which is understandable considering the difference in production time/value between a major animated film like Lilo & Stitch and a book such as this. While one should not expect to see art on par with the original movie, I think people who purchase this book will be more than happy with the overall story and accompanying art of this volume.**I received an advanced copy of this book from Netgalley.com & the publisher in exchange for an honest review**"}, {"userName": "Megalion", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14853675-megalion", "userReview": "My first time reading manga. A very interesting experience because it's one thing to adjust to reading from the right to the left. Having to start at the back of the book, took me a few minutes to realize I needed to do that. Even with the giant warning \"You're at the END of the book!\" In any case, fun short chapters, each containing a short story. The first half of the book features Stitch with a different girl. And a fun running plot line that carried through the chapters. Yet it didn't reach a conclusion before the second half of the book where it's now Lilo with Stitch. And I'm sorry but I really was surprised at how Lilo was portrayed. As a SPOILED BRAT. She sometimes was self obsessed to the point of rudeness. Sometimes her reaction to one of Stitch's screwups was way out of proportion and she would scream rather abusively at him. It was startling... and worrisome as I'd hate to think kids would get the impression that any of that is ok. Otherwise, great fun! Thank you to the publisher for the advanced copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Tamara\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2925473-tamara", "userReview": "This was so cute!! I knew I had to read it because as a kid I LOVED the Pokemon manga by Tsukirino, Magical Pokemon Journey, Volume 1: A Party with Pikachu. My sister and I were also super into the Lilo & Stitch movie and TV show as well. Safe to say this manga was just as adorable as I thought it would be! I think I would have really enjoyed it as a kid. Although it's not really something I'd pick up as an adult if I didn't already have that nostalgic tie to Tsukirino or Lilo & Stitch.https://hercommonplaceblog.wordpress...."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10940205-patrick", "userReview": "Solid manga for all ages. the artwork seemed a little sketchy, literally.
