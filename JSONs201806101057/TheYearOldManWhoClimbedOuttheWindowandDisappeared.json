Oh so dumb. The humor, if it could be called that, is roughly on par with children's knock knock jokes. And this feeble comedy is hammered on with an incredible relentlessness over 400 pages. Ha ha...people drink vodka! Ha ha! A man who doesn't like politics meets every important political leader over 5 decades...ha ha! Religion and politics are dumb. Guffaw guffaw. I actively groaned more times than be counted. I suppose this title will be the darling of book groups comprised of older ladies (centenarians?) but it's a horrid mashup of Big Fish and Forrest Gump. Appalling. Readers are also expected to be dumb enough to swallow the idea that Sweden does not have access to forensic science in the year of our Lord 2005.*Very slight spoiler alert below*I found myself wondering at the \"ho-hum\" attitude of our \"hero\" in the face every every major event of his life...who the fuck would want to live 100 years with that kind of blase feeling about everything?!

The only problem is that he's still in good health, and one day, he turns 100. A big celebration is in the works, but Allan really isn't interested (and he'd like a bit more control over his vodka consumption). So he decides to escape. He climbs out the window in his slippers and embarks on a hilarious and entirely unexpected journey, involving, among other surprises, a suitcase stuffed with cash, some unpleasant criminals, a friendly hot-dog stand operator, and an elephant (not to mention a death by elephant).It would be the adventure of a lifetime for anyone else, but Allan has a larger-than-life backstory: Not only has he witnessed some of the most important events of the twentieth century, but he has actually played a key role in them. Starting out in munitions as a boy, he somehow finds himself involved in many of the key explosions of the twentieth century and travels the world, sharing meals and more with everyone from Stalin, Churchill, and Truman to Mao, Franco, and de Gaulle. Quirky and utterly unique, The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared has charmed readers across the world. My Review: Seriously, Sweden? THIS is the best you've got to offer?I am not a charmed reader, I'm a ticked-off reader who does not wish to continue on the tedious journey between 2005 and, as of chapter 9 which I did not read, WWII. I've already been dragged back to 1905. Oh hell, I didn't like this \u201cutterly unique\u201d (someone needs to explain the concept of a superlative, therefore unmodifiable, part of speech to the copywriter) bag of doorknobs and frankly can't see why anyone would. It's ponderous, it's got disagreeable people practically bursting from it, and it's supposed to be charming? And Winston Groom's people should be examining the damn thing right close. That Forrest Gump comparison sounds to me like the sound of a gun being spiked: \u201cLook! We admitted it was a lift! No one's hiding it!\u201dI'll say not. Not hiding the dullness, either.

The story is set in Sweden and is about the life and adventures of our hero Allan Karlsson who on his hundredth birthday climbed out the window of his old people\u2019s home and disappeared. He then sets out on a journey where he steals a suitcase which turns out to contain a fortune that was paid over to a group of bikers by a Russian organized crime syndicate as payment for a drug deal. There then follows an unlikely but very amusing story of drug dealers trying to track the money down and the police starting a nationwide hunt for Allan after a warrant is issued for a triple murder. As the book progresses, Allan collects a motley crew of really interesting but flawed characters plus an elephant, that somehow all manage to stay one step ahead of the police for much of the book. The book is also interspersed with flashbacks of Allan\u2019s life and how he inadvertently managed to be in the right place at the wrong time and helped influence a number of events and changed the course of twentieth century history.This book is pure entertainment as far as I am concerned. I wouldn\u2019t say I was finding myself exploding into fits of hysterical laughter as I read the book. However, I found myself smiling as I turned the pages and couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at some of the situations that Allan and his group of friends found themselves in.

Everything was just too smooth, too convenient. I struggled to finish it and I cannot understand what all the hype is about. The writing style seemed off to - aside from the lack of speech marks, there was a lot of repetition and unnecessary bits that I feel might have been the fault of the translator.

And I say that, not negatively, because truly, how much can you expect from an 100-year-old man who climbs out of a window?Well, Allan Karlsson is not your typical 100-year-old man, and this book will prove it to you. I read some of the reviews before I started it, and many people compared the book to the movie Forrest Gump. After finishing the book, I realize I hadn't once thought of Forrest Gump, nor made any comparisons. (Maybe I haven't seen Forrest Gump enough times).I enjoyed reading this book because it's very cleverly funny, and with so many historical figures thrown in you'll lose track of how Allan came into contact with them. From President Truman/Johnson/Nixon, Mao Tse-Tung, Kim Il-sung AND Kim Jong-il, Stalin, and Brezhnev, Allan's story is unbelievable and over-the-top. But the fact remains that, sometimes, life can be so unbelievable, it has to be true. The narrative goes between Allan's history and what happens to him after he climbs out of the window of the elderly folks home on his 100th birthday. The fact that Allan is in an old folks home would lead you to believe he's a doddering old man who has been deteriorating there for some time, but in fact he'd only been in the home for a few months, and only then because he'd blown his own house to the sky. Sound interesting?The book follows Allan through his past and present adventures and makes the reader feel kind of bad that they haven't had a coffee with at least ONE former communist leader (what kind of life have I been leading, anyway??) unlike Allan, who has sung, danced, drank, ate, AND had coffee - with a lot of them. I enjoyed Allan as a character who is extremely mild-mannered, with absolutely no interest in politics or religion, and thus ends up working and travelling to any number of political and religious places. The storyline and characters blend and flow very well, and while this wasn't a book I couldn't put down because I HAD to know what was going to happen, it did keep my interest and I enjoyed it. Plus...wouldn't you hope that - if you had the misfortune to make it to the age of 100 - you would be brave enough to climb out of a window and start over again?"}, {"userName": "Hal", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8323471-hal", "userReview": "This novel is absolutely insane!

However, after a more careful revision and after re-reading a couple of passages, I decided this should get a solid two-star rating. The reason is simple: a one star rating, by my mind, is for a book I deem incomparably stupid and written by an imbecile who can't put a couple of words together to form an at least decent story. I have given one star ratings before, and after looking through them, I have to admit that, in my opinion, they were totally deserved. \"The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared\" is not that bad. I didn't find anything I particularly liked about the book, or anything that would be considered \"good\" in terms of fiction, but one of my criteria for giving something one star is that it has to have horrible writing. The kind filled with adverbs (Stephen King is right, you know), where there's no sentence longer than four words, where there's no development in style or even a good old fashioned bit of text that sorta-really-actually resembles another piece of writing. It wasn't like that with Jonasson's book; the writing isn't especially disgusting or in any way a horrible experience. Most of it could be turned on to the decent side, if he would just pay more attention to details. That's why, in the end, this gets two little golden shining stars. For starters, this book is absurd. And not absurd in the fictional way, not fantasy-absurd. No. Real absurd. There's nothing plausible about this work. I know, after reading it, that it was probably meant to be absurd and that in general fiction is supposed to touch on situations that might not be real, but Jonasson went out of his way to make this one really test your patience! And, frankly, it does just that - it doesn't appeal to your imagination, rather it punches your endurance right in the face and yells at her until you finally decide you've had enough. Now, don't bust my balls over this. Fiction - I do know - is not real. But at least with good fiction, the author tries to make it as plausible as possible. In here, the absurdity was multiplied by the horrifying sense of humor that the author seemed to enjoy.I won't even bother with a full synopsis, I'll just strike through what I though were really bad moments. Apparently, Allan (the centenarian the title of the book is referring to) saved and had an eccentric dinner with general Franco, during which they came to be on first-name terms. After that, he was commanded by Roosevelt to create a bomb (hello there, nuke); he spent some time in libraries, researching in order to understand the chemical reactions that Americans were using for their weapons, and he single-handedly solved the biggest problem they had: controlling a nuclear fission. Between two sessions at that most secret library, he would serve coffee at Oppenheimer's table. While being there, as a waiter, he decided to suggest to Oppenheimer to split the uranium in two equal parts and detonate the bomb before it reached the destination. At the exact same time, Vice President Truman sort of walked into the room, found out what happened and declared Allan hero of the day, asking him to join in for a bite in Washington, at his favorite Mexican restaurant. After they drank a dubious amount of tequila, Allan and Truman were, of course, best buddies. The Vice President apparently amused Allan by imitating the pathetic attempts Roosevelt made when he tried to get up from his wheelchair. Funny, really, because some minutes later, the centenarian was there to hear the first announcement of Roosevelt's death. Does this whole scene seem plausible, in any way, to you? While we're on the subject of world leaders that Allan had dinner with, let's not forget to include Stalin and Mao; they really entertained him with amazing dinners, with the exception of Mao, who only had noodles to offer him. I mean, that always happens in normal life, right? At one point, it's also suggested that he was the one who ordered the bombing of Hiroshima, on the 6th of August 1945, though by my humble opinion, the author got the bomber model wrong. He says it's a B56, but it was a Boeing B29 Superfotress; the B56 is another kind of tactical bomber. Plus, Allan was apparently a highly intelligent man and could learn new languages in a matter of months. Originally, he was from Sweden. I understood the affinity for English, which is a simple language, for Spanish, which is not so simple but still a pretty straightforward one, but I stopped believing him at Chinese. For real, Jonasson? Also, because of how the 20th century went, I was positive he would also get to learn Russian - and I was in no way wrong. He picked it up, by his own saying, in a school named \"Gulag\". Nice joke, Jonasson. You're really making me laugh. It was never funny. Not even \"sarcastic-smile\" funny. Not even \"you-should-smile-at-this-because-the-author-tried-to-be-witty\" funny. Never. Let me give you an example of what I had to sit through, page after page: \"The bad news\", said Julius, and lowered his voice a little, \"the bad news is that when we were well and truly pissed last night, we forgot to turn off the fan in the freezer-room.\"\"And?\" said Allan.\"And... the guy inside must be dead cold - or cold dead - by now.\"With a worried look, Allan scratched his neck while he decided whether to let the news of his carelessness spoil the day. \"Oh dear,\" he said. \"But, on the other hand, I must say that you've got these eggs just right, not too hard and not too runny.\" Yes. That is the wit this author brings to the table. Can't make much of it. I doubt many people can make much of it. It's nonsense, it's empty blabber, his dialogue is composed mostly of useless, senseless jokes that are supposed to evidentiate his character's philosophy of life. Which is, basically: \"it is what it is, therefore, what will be will be.\" I can't think of anything stupider than that. I'm ok with accepting what comes your way in life, but extending that philosophy to anything and everything in your path is mentally unhealthy and doesn't make for a very good fighter when life throws you something you have to struggle with. The characters' conscience seems to have been thrown out the window, because killing people becomes just a minor deficiency of their trip and is dismissed as unimportant. They never panic - they don't even scare at the sight of human bodies and they're as comfortable when disposing of them as a 50 year old experienced Russian mercenary. Then there comes an even more confusing part to the story - the elephant. Sonya (the elephant), seems to be an enriching element. Was it put into the story to give it depth? I don't know. But related to her was this book's funniest moment: the death of Bucket, a petty thief and a certified idiot. He threatened Allan with a gun, but then the centenarian man had the brilliant idea to make him slide and fall into one of Sonya's dumps and command the elephant to sit down... on top of the poor guy. Consequently, Bucket died, squashed by an elephant's butt. What was this particular Scandinavian smoking when he wrote this?!"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2014", "userURL":

most hilarious, off-the-charts, tragicomedy-idea I have read in a long time. Probably the most outrageous bucket list in motion ever constructed as a plot. I felt a little bit psycho for sniggering where I should not. And laughing out loud made me question my own levels of emotional intelligence! But really, the book is written so bizarrely funny, I just could not help myself. Did I stop reading when I thought to rather see a shrink than continue? Of course not! The action-packed murder, suspense, thriller had me tied to the characters, of which Sonya the elephant was my favorite, like a desperate closet-masochist! It is not really a murder | Suspense | thriller, but it contains many of the elements there of.You not only have to think outside the box here, you will have to stand outside it as well and make sure to drag a ton of salt with you. You won't make it otherwise! Everything in the book could have happened, but not with the satirical twist it was done with. Crazy, obscene, and cynically brilliant. It is more or less a hundred years of world history summarized in one aged old man's life story. Just imagine if it all could have been true! Indeed, an unusual rendition of the question 'what if'! The book reminds me so much about the Broadway black comedy play, which became a successful motion picture \"The Little Horror Shop\". In the one scene a masochist is waiting in the dentist's office for his turn, when the sadistic dentist comes out with a huge bore machine yelling \"who wants to have a slow...painful...bridge!\" The little masochist excitedly jumped up and down on his chair, pleading \"Me!....Do Me!....oh please do me!\" - or something like that. And the audience fell down laughing, including yours truly, scared into anaphylactic shock!Yes, as someone commented elsewhere, it can be Forest Gump on steroids, and in my humble opinion, it would have taken a few truck loads of the stuff for Forest to become Alan Emmanuel Karlsson.It is the same idea as  \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" Yes, very much the same, come to think of it! Only this time the bus accommodates the one-hundred-year-old Alan Emmanuel Karlsson, who decided to elope from the old-age home in his Swedish town, and his cronies, whom he met on his new adventure: Julius Johnsson(67), eternal student Benny Ljungberg, the red-haired Gunilla Bj\u00f6rkund, newly-religious food-wholesaler Bosse(Benny's brother), gangster-boss Per-Gunmar Gerdin, Sonya the elephant and the Alsation dog, Buster. In hot pursuit was Chief Inspector G\u00f6ran Aronsson, the police dog Kicki, and prosecutor Ranelid. This is social commentary at its most bizarre, which makes it even more hilarious. Hilarious in the sense of plot and the execution there of. The two parallel stories, told in alternating chapters, both revert the ordinary into the extraordinary in consistent high drama. Most of this book can be offered as stand-up comedy and it will raise the roof of the venue with hysterical laughter. But, you must have a healthy sense of humor to appreciate it. In the end, I walked away with a smile and will forever do so when I see this book on my shelves. It made me laugh at the world. For today it is okay. Tomorrow is another day.But right now the world is a much better place because this story made me laugh for everything that is wrong with our human existence. Just for once.Kudos to Bobby McFerrin's song: Don't worry, be happy!"}, {"userName": "Sawsan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11592808-sawsan", "userReview": "\u064a\u0647\u0631\u0628 \u0622\u0644\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u0641\u0630\u0629 \u063a\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u064a\u062f \u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629 \u0648\u064a\u062e\u062a\u0641\u064a \u064a\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u064f\u062e\u0637\u0637 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0644\u062a\u0642\u064a \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0627\u062a \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629 \u0648\u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u064f\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0639\u0629\u0648\u0623\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0631\u0648\u0628 \u064a\u062d\u0643\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0639\u0646 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0622\u0644\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629 \u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u0645\u063a\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a\u0637\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u064a\u0642\u0639 \u0641\u064a \u0648\u0631\u0637\u0627\u062a \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u064a\u062e\u0631\u062c \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0628\u0633\u0627\u0637\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u0641\u0648\u064a\u0629\u064a\u062a\u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0648\u064a\u0639\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0648\u064a\u064f\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0642 \u0631\u0624\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0637\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0633\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0623\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0628 \u0641\u0643\u0627\u0647\u064a \u0648\u0633\u0627\u062e\u0631"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Want to know where 'the old man' went when he climbed out of the window?

Seriously, it's about as imaginative as \"Jonas Jonasson.\"Here is a list of some alternative titles for your consideration Jonas son of himself - how aboutThe Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Went on a Killing SpreeorThe Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Likes to Blow Stuff Up orThe Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Influenced the Major Political events of the 20th CenturyThen there are all the \"How to\" type titles like...The Hundred-Year-Old Man's DIY guide to building an Atomic Bomb andThe Hundred-Year-Old Man's guide to making 50 million in 50 secondsWhat about my personal favouriteThe Hundred-Year-Old Man's Tips on How to Train your Elephant - From Toilet Training to Assassination...or How to Bury Your Enemies in ShiteThis book appealed somewhat to the inner Swede in me. Not that I grew up in Sweden but I have visited just about all the Swedish places mentioned in the book. The story is a black comedy - or at least as black as a Swede can get. I think I was more amused at what Swedes find funny than the humour itself.Anyway, Allan Karlsson, a Centenarian (Hundred-year-old) escapes from his nursing home and goes on an adventure that will see him tangle with thieves and drug lords, all while staying one step ahead of the law - more by accident than design. We then get Allan's backstory which covers his life and influence on a swag of the politics and politicians of the mid to late 20th century. Allan Karlsson has rubbed shoulders with the likes of Mao, Stalin, Truman and a heap of other notable world leaders - And why would any of them be interested in Allan? Because Allan likes to blow things up. He's very good with explosives - from little ones to the very biggest of all.At some point the backstory becomes the main story with the present day adventure being more of an interlude - which was a shame because I preferred the present day Hundred-year-old Allan's story. Allan mixing it up with notable world famous characters was cute the first couple of times but after that it was starting to get old.The story ended well, though the very last lines did nothing to easy my Australian paranoia of an Indonesian invasion.Overall a fast fun read even though it's not something I would usually go for. That's the benefit of group reads.3 stars"}, {"userName": "Miss Ravi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21314656-miss-ravi", "userReview":

landmarks; he is completely apolitical, loves to blow shit up, and is delightfully devil-may care. His elderly self hasn't changed in the slightest, and so we can continue to see the world through a pair of skewed eyes that are nonetheless quite fun. At first, I thought this might have turned into a modern-day Candide, but the story is still focuses very much on story and has veered away fairly successfully from allegory. So, after finishing the novel, I can say that it has successfully veered away from any type of overt allegory, may the allegorical heavens be praised. On the other hand, I enjoyed the way that our intrepid hero managed to comment about so many political features of the 20th century by being so apolitical. I personally enjoyed the progress, having read and enjoyed so much history in much the same way the author has. He stayed away from some hot topics of debate and blithely character-dropped the big movers and shakers and it was a blast. I understand there will be a movie? In that case, I certainly hope the cast of actors are up to the job or the CGI gives more than credible performances or else the movie will bomb very hard, otherwise. The novel's strength lies in the reader's nodding at events they've either lived or have a more than passing interest in. Otherwise, the novel becomes a novelette about the zany adventures of craftily created random characters that are so much larger than life precisely because they also have to stand up to real people in the past that did so many great things. (As we are made to believe for our intrepid hero.) If that's the case, then it's a decent enough comedy, but if you're taking the whole novel as a piece, then I'm sure you will be pleasantly surprised by the stroll."}, {"userName": "Steven  Godin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26706841-steven-godin", "userReview": "Abandoned p/77.Couldn't connect with it at all, Allan Karlsson, the one hundred year old man in question was a pain in the bum, even in the brief time I spent in his company.

The story begins with Allan Karlsson, running away from his nursing home on the afternoon of his 100th birthday - just before the celebration is about to begin (with the Mayor & local media in attendance no less). He makes his way to the local bus station. And while he's waiting for a bus to take him out of town, a young tough asks him to guard his suitcase while he goes to the bathroom. Of course the bus arrives while the man is in the bathroom, and Allan doesn\u2019t hesitate, he boards the bus with the other man\u2019s suitcase, unsure what it contains, but really hoping for a pair of shoes because he left the nursing home with only slippers on his feet. Half the town is already looking for Allan Karlsson.......and now, so is the man who came back to find his suitcase stolen. He's furious, vowing to kill Allan when he finds him. This is just the beginning of his hilarious journey, while on the run he meets a variety of quirky characters and where he looks back at his adventures during his 100 year life (he was a bomb expert, present at most major historical events). The story goes back forth between Allan\u2019s past & the present chase to catch up with him.

In his extensive worldwide travels he meets and befriends Franco, Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung, Presidents Truman and Johnson, Churchill, etc. etc. I love the bare-bones style Jonasson uses in this book, which reminds me of my beloved Karin Fossum.I also admire Allan's constant laissez-faire attitude about everything. He just goes with the flow and it usually works out to his advantage. I adore chill men, and I loved reading about this guy - he was like the epitome of chill.I laughed while reading this book.This book is sort of a fairytale for adults - it reminded me of THE MOUSE THAT ROARED, which is also a sort of adult fairytale in my opinion.June 2014: The REAL 100-year-old man who climbed out the window and disappeared: Link in Spanish: http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/ultimas_no...Link in English: http://abcnews.go.com/International/b..."}, {"userName": "\u0644\u064a\u0644\u064a", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22926746", "userReview": "\u0634\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u06f1\u06f0-\u06f1\u06f5 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0645!\u0648 \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646 \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0631\u0632\u0634 \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e\u06cc \u0648 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u0627 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u060c \u06af\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0642\u06cc\u0642\u0627 \u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0646\u0634 \u0644\u0630\u062a \u0628\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0645!:)"}, {"userName": "Noeleen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5333773-noeleen", "userReview": "I didn't know what to expect when I started reading Jonas Jonasson\u2019s The Hundred-Year Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared.

Taking us on a journey through the main historical events of the 20th century, Allan Karlsson has certainly lived an eventful, out of the ordinary, crazy life, meeting the top players in the political arena as he does so. Not only that, but our Allan has had an enormous impact on many of these events. Taking it all in his stride, is he bothered? No, not really! Rather than being politically minded or politically persuaded one way or the other, his main concern appears to be when and where his next good meal will come from, when and where his next shot of vodka will appearAmongst all the fun within these pages, there are important underlying messages for the reader to consider...ageing, unlikely friendships that are sometimes found in the most unexpected ways, the importance of living one's life to the fullest, a life that you will only live once and therefore taking chances and grasping opportunities when they are presented to youIn summary, this novel is weird, wacky and wonderful. There are many laugh out loud moments. Recommended if you are looking for a good giggle and an interesting and bizarre take on the main historical events of the 20th century"}, {"userName": "Marilena   \u2693", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49704115-marilena", "userReview": "*3,5* \u0394\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0386\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd,\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03be\u03b5\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b7\u03b4\u03ae\u03be\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u0384\u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b8\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b8\u03bb\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af.\u03a3\u03c4\u03bf ''\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b4\u03b9''\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03cc\u03c7\u03b9 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf.\u039c\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b5\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2,\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b7 \u03b1\u03c0'\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03b7\u03be\u03b5 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03be\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0'\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03be\u03b5\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1.\u039f Johansson \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc, \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ae\u03b4\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b5\u03b9, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9.\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4'\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1.."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2147949-victoria", "userReview": "Let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s a ridiculous title. I like ridiculous titles though, they breed curiosity at the very least (even if they do get shortened in discussion for ease and amusement \u2013 my favourite shortened title thus far is \u201cHeartbreaking sh*tty sh*itness\u201d \u2013 5 points to the person who works out the full title first). So when Betty picked this for book club this month, I was at least drawn in by the title (and of course by the author\u2019s fantastic name). And the ridiculousness of the title most definitely suits the equally ridiculous story. \tIt does pretty much what it says on the tin (er\u2026cover) \u2013 a centenarian climbs out of the window of his old-people\u2019s home and vanishes. Except he doesn\u2019t vanish, because we follow his adventure, as well as learning about all the fantastic escapades he had through his life. Fantastic they most definitely are, spanning almost the entire twentieth century and including lunch with pretty much every world leader going. The story itself gets quite absurd and I know that grates on some people \u2013 in fact, I\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t grate on me (when I read the blurb, I was certainly expecting it to) but in fact, the more ridiculous the story gets, and the more that the reader is asked to suspend belief, the more wonderful the novel becomes. \tIts comedy starts out light but gradually becomes laugh-out-loud hilarity and my husband-to-be shot more than one glance at me for my random chuckles as he attempted to watch TV. In fact, when I related some of the tales and misadventures to him, they became even funnier and at one point, we were both creased over with happy tears in our eyes and I couldn\u2019t get to the end of my sentence (he hadn\u2019t read it of course, but laughter is contagious and some of the events are down-right riotous). \tAllan (the centenarian) is a magnificent character with a wonderful attitude to life, and I wonder whether a carefree and positive view on life is the way to get to that grand old age. That or the substantial amounts of vodka the characters here seem to drink. He wasn\u2019t the only endearing character either \u2013 I loved them all, even down to the cartoon depictions of Stalin and Truman. Herbert Einstein is seat-wettingly funny, Benny is fantastically clever and the Never Again crew should win awards for cheesiest criminal gang in existence. \tThis is a feel-good novel down to the ground. It\u2019s a pleasantly light and humorous farce, interspersed with a brief history of communism and the atomic bomb. It\u2019s the first book in a long while that has given me a good deal of a trance like \u2018book hangover\u2019 and has made me want to delve into the hitherto unknown (to me) world of Swedish literature. I just hope they don\u2019t all spend so long naming the cars that their protagonists use!"}], "description": "The international publishing sensation\u2014over two million copies sold.A reluctant centenarian much like Forrest Gump (if Gump were an explosives expert with a fondness for vodka) decides it\u2019s not too late to start over \u2026After a long and eventful life, Allan Karlsson ends up in a nursing home, believing it to be his last stop. The only problem is that he\u2019s still in good health, and in one day, he turns 100. A big celebration is in the works, but Allan really isn\u2019t interested (and he\u2019d like a bit more control over his vodka consumption). So he decides to escape. He climbs out the window in his slippers and embarks on a hilarious and entirely unexpected journey, involving, among other surprises, a suitcase stuffed with cash, some unpleasant criminals, a friendly hot-dog stand operator, and an elephant (not to mention a death by elephant).It would be the adventure of a lifetime for anyone else, but Allan has a larger-than-life backstory: Not only has he witnessed some of the most important events of the twentieth century, but he has actually played a key role in them. Starting out in munitions as a boy, he somehow finds himself involved in many of the key explosions of the twentieth century and travels the world, sharing meals and more with everyone from Stalin, Churchill, and Truman to Mao, Franco, and de Gaulle.
