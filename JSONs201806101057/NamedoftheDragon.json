Named of the Dragon is set in a small coastal village in Wales, and references Tennyson's epic poem, The Idylls of the King (which also happens to be a beloved favorite of mine). Nerd that I am, I knew immediately from reading some reviews that the hero and heroine, Gareth and Lyn, MUST be somehow connected to Sir Gareth and Lynnette of the Idylls, and they were! Lots of Authurian references from the Welsh mythic tales, The Mabinogi, as well as some brief history of Henry VII and his extremely young mother, Margaret Beauford.I've read all of Kearsley's books now, and this offering, while not one of her best, is still better then alot of what passes for romantic suspense these days, IMO. If you enjoy Barbara Michaels, Barbara Erskine or Mary Stewart, you should enjoy the books of Kearsley. I'd love to see a resurgence in this genre of book, which hasn't been popular since the 1970's. Alot of current books claim to be romantic suspense, but usually feature 80% romance and 20% suspense, which isn't really my thing. In addition, I personally want my \"paranormal\" suspense to include spooky houses, ghostly sightings, reincarnation or time travel...not vamps- and weres- and zombie-lovers....

I think Jill was right. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate this book. No matter what, Kearsley's talent with words and gift for world building captivate me, but the storyline, pacing, and characterization in Named of the Dragon left something to be desired. First, let's get a feel for the setting.Angle, Pembrokeshire, Wales. \nAs you can see, it's beautiful, and Kearsley is no slouch in the description department; the woman knows how to convey an atmosphere. Castle Farm, where the main characters in the book are staying. \nWhile the setting is beautiful and the writing solid, I had a very difficult time connecting with the story. I couldn't sympathize with the characters at all, as they ran the gamut from ridiculously self-absorbed (Bridget) to uncomfortably passive (Lyn) to unnecessarily abrasive (Gareth), and finally, detached and selfish (James and Christopher). I couldn't bring myself to really like any of them, and that made the whole thing feel like a chore. The historical mystery Kearsley wove into this tale, while interesting, ended up going nowhere, the imagery seeming to serve no other purpose than to draw the reader in, which then felt like a betrayal when the almost paranormal mystery of the whole thing ended up not being very paranormal at all. Any suspense Kearsley built up throughout the story was deflated by the lackluster, fairly anticlimactic resolution. The love story, as well, while being almost characteristically Kearsley, fell short of what I'm used to. Her romance aspects are always subtle, but this time around, it was nearly non-existent, so when the ending comes around, it's hard to believe what's happening. Still, its atmosphere, originality, and beautiful prose (a Kearsley trademark if ever she had one) combine to make this at least a slightly enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "TL ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl", "userReview": "2.5 starsI hate to give this a low rating but it just didn't work for me. This one didn't feel as well-balanced as her other ones. The elements I loved about her previous ones didn't mesh well here, it felt out of place.I did love all the characters and the idea of the story... and the hint of a connection with a certain king and kingdom got me really excited. I'm a sucker for those type of stories and sort of re-telling, it's just a fun world to get lost in.Maybe I was expecting more than what I got? I didn't read any reviews before starting this, as soon as it came in the mail I jumped on it. The promised connection almost felt like an afterthought even though it wasn't... it didn't come into play until later in thee story by then I just couldn't buy it or care about it very much. The story by itself was well done and the setting is but there were times I had to push myself to read through this. I was more curious about the people themselves than the narrative at the end point.. am I repeating myself? Haha.The romance was slow-building between a certain two and had me smiling at times but I wasn't really invested in it. I would sort of recommend but not as your first by this author.

Because she does a great job with landscape, with the feelings it can invoke, but Scotland or Cornwall aren\u2019t my landscapes.Then I remembered I had already got a couple of chapters into Named of the Dragon. Suffice it to say that the landscape was satisfactory, and I would probably have felt homesick had I read this when not in Wales. Particularly at the bit with the lovely little chapel, St Govan\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ve meant to go there for a while, because of the Gawain link, and this reminded me.I\u2019m not sure why I stopped at that point, before; while I adore the Welsh and Arthurian aspects of this book, it might have been the characters that didn\u2019t work for me. Mostly the supporting characters: Elen, with her Arthurian fantasy; Bridget, with her flirtations and lack of remorse over basically planning to cheat on her partner; Christopher, with the general veneer of charm that lacked the warmth of (I couldn\u2019t help but make the comparison) Stuart in The Winter Sea. I enjoy Kearsley\u2019s books, but sometimes the supernatural links are too tenuous for me, or rather, too tenuously explained, too tangential to the actual emotional plot.Because really, it doesn\u2019t matter if Elen and her baby are really somehow related to Igraine and Arthur. What matters is the main character\u2019s gradual acceptance of her own child\u2019s death, her ability to finally put it aside and belong in the present, and help someone else. It doesn\u2019t matter if Gareth and Lyn are somehow linked back to Gareth and Lynette, because their relationship is all their own anyway (and let\u2019s face it, Lyn\u2019s not half as nasty as Lynette, and this Gareth is at least twice as nasty as Fairhands).I was glad that the romance wasn\u2019t laid on too thick, here. There\u2019s hope, potential, but nothing certain. If the book had been longer, more would have been okay, but for the length and where the story stopped, it was right to stop at that moment of potential.Originally posted here."}, {"userName": "Book of Secrets", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3453249-book-of-secrets", "userReview": "What grabbed my attention about this book was the Welsh setting and the Arthurian legend tie-ins. The writing was beautiful, especially the lovely descriptions of Angle, Pembrokeshire, however I never felt truly engaged in the story itself.The main character, Lyn, is a literary agent spending Christmas holiday at Castle Farm in Wales with one of the authors she represents. Lyn's baby boy died five years prior, and the grief still weighs heavily on her. In Angle, she meets a strange young woman with a baby boy of her own. The woman (Elen) believes her son is in danger, and soon Lyn has dreams of a mysterious woman in blue who tries to convince her to protect her own child. While all this is going on, Lyn has a slow-building romance with a curmudgeonly Welsh playwright named Gareth.While I adore Arthurian legends and Celtic myths, their connection to the present-day story wasn't that convincing. Lyn and Gareth were solid characters, but I thought the supporting cast fell flat. I was surprised by the outcome of the mystery (what/who was threatening Elen's baby). While not my favorite book of Kearsley's, I did enjoy experiencing a Christmas in Wales.Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Christine Spoors", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39719286-christine-spoors", "userReview": "I loved that this book was set in Angle, in the south of Wales. It was set around Christmas time which is always nice to read about. Through nightmares, the main character Lyn gets drawn into a plot filled with ancient myths surrounding Merlin and Henry Tudor (VII). This was such a clever plot, which read like a mystery, and I could never guess what was going to happen next.I would say trigger warning for anyone who's lost a child as the main character lost a baby and her nightmares focus around that. Babies make me really emotional, so I felt like this book was sadder and a more stressful read than her others. Which I guess proves how great her writing is but it made me tense as I read it (which probably sound silly). I definitely still enjoyed it though!The main character Lyn was nice to read about, but I always like the characters she writes. Kearsley just writes their emotions so well, you can't help but like them. Lyn is a literary agent, so that was interesting to read about. Her characters always have such cool careers. I liked the rest of the characters and how they developed, but some of them were quite flawed and so I didn't feel quite as much love for them. Which is realistic I suppose, she doesn't just write perfect characters.Wales is a part of the UK that I've never really read about (sorry Wales), so I loved that this book was set there. Kearsley is so brilliant at writing different locations and I like that she actually stayed in Angle to research. Her dedication to research really pays off. I loved the coastal location and that the main character did lots of sightseeing so we learned more about the area as we read.This book didn't have as much romance, unlike her others, and I found that I missed that a little. I won't spoil anything, but I didn't like the way the possible love interest acted towards the main character a few times in this book, so I missed not having a romance to hope for by the end. I think this book was first written in 1998, and I wonder if that's why? Anyway, it did make a nice change to have romance as less of a side-plot."}, {"userName": "Sophia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063928-sophia", "userReview": "This author has been on my radar for so long and I've wanted to read her books and just somehow never did. Finally, the perfect storm of opportunity with this re-release, blurb, setting, and mood made it possible. I got two delightful surprises nearly from the beginning. First, I didn't realize what this author's writing style would be and soon discovered that I felt like I could have been reading one of several of my favorites. I had to chuckle when I saw in the description afterward that the author is even compared to other favorites of mine like Mary Stewart or Diana Gabaldon. Sometimes, comparisons are far off the mark for me, but in truth, this one would be an accurate assessment for me.My second surprise was time period. I wasn't expecting the holiday season, but I got Christmas in a small Welsh village near Pembroke. The tradition of decorating, caroling, Christmas services in the little country church, parties, shopping and presents were fun and as vibrant as the characters and story.So no surprise that I found this, my first outing with the author, was a splendid read and I am definitely going back for more of her stuff.This was an atmospheric romantic suspense with mild magical element to it with the emphasis not so much on romance as a tension that leads to romance. The story is a slow build and slow burn affair that gently works its way to the startling climax at the end. It was like watching an approaching storm that starts out as distant building clouds and pressure that slowly form and approach. You can see it and feel it coming, but it takes a while. I enjoyed that sensation.This was a modern story that began when Lyn Ravenshaw, literary agent, is coerced into a Christmas holiday in the Welsh countryside to act as wingman and distraction for her prize author. Whatever Bridget wants and all that. Lyn sees Bridget clearly and doesn't mind being used since it gets her invited into the home of an author she respects and the chance to meet a reclusive playwright whose way with words enchanted her. Bridget has author James Swift dangling after her, but it is untouchable and withdrawn Gareth she wants. Lyn can't see the appeal in the insufferable Gareth, but finds it all rather entertaining at first to watch Bridget and the men buzzing around her.Castle Farm is a lovely old quirky place and the village is typical of most, but Lyn senses underlying tension between the people of Castle Farm and then there are her own nightmarish dreams that have taken on new aspects. Uneasiness becomes outright concern when events of the distant past start to parallel events of the present. Is the young widow next door crazy with her talk of dragons and Merlin or is something much more concrete and sinister going on? Will the encounter with these people break Lyn who has suffered guilt and grief or will it be her road to healing?Now, I did enjoy this book and definitely want more from the author. I loved the atmosphere and over all mastery of storytelling I had in this book. I did get the sense that the author could have made it even better which I know conflicts with what I just said. The difference between good and great, if you will. The ties to the dream world were confusing and a muddle that never quite gets fully explained especially since there are ties to Merlin and Arthur legends and later Owen who led the Welsh rebellion and still later with early Tudor ties. It was all mashed together and distracting. I also felt that the suspense element could have been teased out better. The waiting and watching were superb, but I felt there were missed opportunities for the villains to be more hands on and stir things up more by being more present than they were.The drawing of the characters and then weaving them into the plot was really good. Even without the mystical dreams and the suspense, just reading about the people was extremely diverting. Bridget was a scene stealer. She cracked me up. She is so unapologetic and willful, but also possesses compassion. James is her counterpart in ways though he is more cerebral and less intuitive. Christopher is a modern rogue. Owen was salt of the earth. Elen is waifish and ethereal.And then there are Gareth and Lyn. He is a craggy man with an old soul who is hard to know and not one that invites closeness and warmth. Lyn is the outsider and looks on, cold and lonely as the others move around her. Her grief and guilt has insulated her against engaging with folk and I loved seeing that change when the village of Angle, Castle Farm, and Gareth start to batter away at her walls. I wanted a bit more in the end, but things were left in a good happy for now spot.All in all, I would dive into this author's books just to get more of the atmosphere and tension, let alone the compelling characters. I would recommend this to folk who enjoy the more classical style romantic suspense.My thanks to Sourcebooks Landmark for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7411485-catherine", "userReview": "This was good, the writing was beautiful and descriptive, but it just didn't really go anywhere.

Bridget told everyone how strong Lyn was, but we only got to see tiny flashes of that. It's not that the book was testament to Lyn's weakness, because she wasn't weak, exactly. She was passive, though, and the book mostly described how internal she was, and that felt at odds with the way Bridget described her.I liked the way legend meshed with reality with absolutely no eye toward a logical explanation, but some of the resulting near-catastrophe felt surreal and ungrounded, and hinted at an ugliness not entirely justified.I liked Lyn in London, too. Her toughness came out when she was in her office and dealing with her coworkers (though I wish she hadn't run from that phone call from Ivor). And I loved, most of all, that Gareth realized he couldn't hide in Wales forever - and didn't expect Lyn to, either.The characters are a little messier here than typical Kearsley, and you can see seeds of future novels, too: the dog! The literary world! The children! Competing brothers! This is a mixed bag. But worth reading, I think."}, {"userName": "Lark of The Bookwyrm's Hoard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9080084-lark-of-the-bookwyrm-s-hoard", "userReview": "I started reading Named of the Dragon immediately after finishing Mary Stewart\u2019s This Rough Magic. Kearsley has been compared to Stewart, and indeed Named of the Dragon has a very Stewart-like feel, updated to more modern times. Kearsley is as easily as good as Stewart at writing description and setting. In this case the setting is (mostly) Wales; since I\u2019ve been there several times, I was able to picture it all the more clearly. It\u2019s a landscape that speaks to me on a very deep level, and I loved the chance to revisit it in my mind\u2019s eye.Like Stewart, Kearsley is also wonderful at creating and revealing character, layer by layer, and at writing first-person narrative. Her main character, Lyn, is both strong and a little fragile, haunted by her baby\u2019s death but determinedly going on with her life. She\u2019s a literary agent, and good at her job. As Lyn deals with the charming but challenging Bridget, her client and friend, and interacts with the other people she encounters, we see the sort of person she is, from her deep love of writing to her innate kindness, backed by a quiet determination and integrity.Other characters take shape as well; it\u2019s less that they develop and grow through the course of the novel than that we come to know them more deeply. Everything we learn about the characters comes from their actions and speech as observed by Lyn; it\u2019s subtly and skillfully done. None of the characters\u2019 motivations are clear-cut, except perhaps Bridget\u2019s, since she\u2019s always very outspoken about what she wants (at least to Lyn.) Kearsley\u2019s depiction of the various literary characters \u2013 Bridget, her writer-boyfriend James, and the playwright Gareth \u2013 and of the London publishing world ring very true. So do the relationships between all these people, and the others who inhabit the pages, from sweet but possibly deluded Elen to the dependable, kindhearted farmer Owen and his bustling, no-nonsense wife Dilys. Kearsley even captures the rhythms of their Welsh speech so well that I could hear the lilt of it.And then there\u2019s the slow building of suspense, from the first vague inklings of something amiss to the climactic moments when the true danger is revealed. The danger in Named of the Dragon is less intense than in many of Stewart\u2019s books, but Lyn\u2019s dreams (which echo both the legendary and historical past and the present) and several inexplicable events contrive to create a growing sense of unease, of something amiss. Kearsley skillfully weaves in symbolism and leitmotif, in particular a baby or child: both real and dreamed, alive and dead, historical and present, and even implicit in the coming Christmas holiday. Intertwined with the child motif are legendary and historical figures: Owen Glyn Dwr, Henry Tudor (Henry VII), King Arthur, Merlin. Lyn isn\u2019t literally \u201cpulled into an ancient world\u201d as the blurb implies, but that world seems to rise like a mist, underlying and permeating the world of the living. It gives the book a slightly magical or mystical feel without crossing the line into magical realism.For me, the only thing that didn\u2019t quite jell was the climax. Coming as the culmination of Lyn\u2019s dreams and apprehensions, it should have worked, but it escalated too quickly, fueled in part by an impulsive act of Lyn\u2019s that seemed\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say out of character, because clearly her dreams were a factor in her decision, but out of character with her daylight self, perhaps. It threw me briefly out of the story and into analytic mode, but I let myself flow along with the story and was soon swept into it again.I\u2019ve labeled this novel \u201cromantic suspense,\u201d but the romance is subtle and largely under the surface \u2013 another similarity to some of Stewart\u2019s books. For all my comparisons of Kearsley to Stewart, though, Named of the Dragon is in no way a knockoff or pale imitation of the latter\u2019s books. Kearsley\u2019s writing style, poetic and matter-of-fact by turns, is distinctly her own, as are her characters and story. I never once felt I was reading a faux Stewart novel, only one which would appeal to those who, like me, love Stewart\u2019s work. It\u2019s as though I\u2019ve discovered a kindred spirit, and I can hardly wait to experience Susanna\u2019s other books.\nReview originally published at The Bookwyrm's Hoard.\nFTC disclosure: I received a review copy from the publisher through NetGalley.

The main setting is the very atmospheric Pembrokeshire coast, Wales. Her descriptions make you feel as though you are right there. I've never had the good fortune to go to Wales, but I feel as though I have been there after reading this book. Lyn Ravenshaw, editor and one of her top clients, Bridget, travel to Wales for to spend the holidays with yet another author (James). Imagine Lyn's surprise and delight at finding still another writer, one she admires greatly, lodging nearby as well (Gareth). There's lots of suspense, a hint of romance, a paranormal element, and more. The Arthurian/Merlin legend plays a significant role as well and is weaved into the plot.

This particular book from 1998 is her 4th successful novel, following 1994 Mariana, 1995 The Splendour Falls, and 1997 The Shadowy Horses. It is not my favorite of all she has written. That would have to be 2008 The Winter Sea, but it is an enjoyable read nonetheless.The setting is Wales, the small town of Angle, near Pembrokeshire and historic Pembroke Castle. (BTW, do go to this book on the author's website to view photographs of this historic place. They're lovely.) The heroine Lyn is a widow still grieving the loss of her baby 5 years ago. She's a literary agent invited by one of her authors to spend Christmas at the home of another famous British author. She also discovers that a very famous reclusive Welsh playwright lives nearby.Add to the mix Lyn's disturbing dreams, an emotionally-fragile widow Elen, who's fearful for her infant son's life and believes Lyn has been sent to protect him, legends and prophecies with ties to King Arthur, Merlin and dragon kings, and you've got another Kearsley novel with a bit of romance, a bit of the paranormal, and a bit of history. As has been stated by many a reviewer, Kearsley is probably the modern writer closest to Mary Stewart in topic and style of writing and that's a big part of the reason I'm so fond of her work. Reading Kearsley is almost a nostalgic trip down the memory lane of my teen years when I loved Mary Stewart so.As I said before, this is not my favorite of her books but it is quite good. The mystery and paranormal element is the weakest part of the book. I enjoyed it more for the characters and their interactions and for the history of the locale.

Fans of her more romantic books, like The Rose Garden, might be a little disappointed. The romance aspect is only hinted at throughout and doesn't really resolve until the very end. Which was fine by me. I was kept more than occupied with the spooky happenings at a fabulous Welsh home, all spiced up with Arthurian legend - a new one for Kearsley. And the characters! Fabulous, as always. I was completely in love with the character of Bridget, as most probably would be. I have had a few friends like her in my lifetime and I can personally attest at how trying they can be, but how sometimes you just can't help but love them regardless. I found that my personality was actually pretty similar to our main character, Lyn, which made it very easy to slip right into this book and relate wholeheartedly to her story. I find this is actually quite often the case in Susanna Kearsley's books. I don't really know how she manages to make every book, with a wide variety of characters and backgrounds, extremely relatable. I guess my only conclusion is that she, like the stories she writes, are just magic.* Oh, and I can also add Wales to my new list of places I want to visit.

Lyn Ravenshaw is a great heroine; a little bullheaded, but endearing and relatable. I think at this point Kearsley wasn't sure how to flesh out a palpable romance though and the teasing of Lyn and Gareth getting together was only hinted at.

Bridget is a prime example, because she came off as a completely self-absorbed man-eater with no nuance. I'm fine with a character being those things, but I want to see nuance. Otherwise it all feels very stereotypical. Overall, mildly enjoyable, but unsatisfying."}, {"userName": "Diane Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9796451-diane-lynn", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this one by Susanna Kearsley. Her writing is so expressive. Towards the end I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. I never saw that ending coming which is always nice. Loved the Merlin/Arthur tie in.

Kearsley has a wonderful way with describing the small town in Wales where most of the book takes place. There were several times that I had to go back and reread a description of where the main character, Lyn, was at the time, whether it be a small wooded area, an old castle, or a famous writers study. The author does a wonderful job of making you feel like you are actually there with the characters.The story was interesting and while I usually do not enjoy mysteries, I did like this one. I really liked Lyn's character a lot and so it was easy to get caught up in the mystery she was trying to solve. My favorite part of the book was the romance between Lyn and Gareth, it was really well done. There was not a lot of talk of love or sex that you would usually find in a romance between two characters. It was two characters slowly getting to know and care for each other and I thought it was really well done.If you enjoy books with a mixture of historical fiction, romance, and a good mystery, I think you will like this book. Kearsley is an excellent writer, and while this is not one of her best it is still a very worthwhile read."}, {"userName": "Rio (Lynne)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3803025-rio-lynne", "userReview": "Kearsley's writing is unique. She holds my interest even when her books aren't fast paced or full of page turning storylines. Named of the Dragon, like many of her other books, simply follows characters everyday lives, nothing really happening, but she keeps me interested with the location, characters and her witty way of throwing history into the fold. In this book Lyn, a literary agent goes to Pembroke for Christmas with one of her clients. Knowing Pembroke's history, I'm intrigued. She stays at a castle farm house, with an eccentric cast of neighbors. Toss in dreams of a medieval lady in a blue gown, Welsh legends and I want to be there in the story. This wasn't my favorite Kearsley book.

Takes place in Angle, Pembrokeshire in South Wales.This ARC was sent to me by NetGalley and Sourcebooks Landmark for an honest review.My TakeNamed of the Dragon was beautifully done, although I didn't get a real sense of it being Christmas. Oh, the words were there, but I wasn't feelin' it. I suspect most of what I did feel was a blend of my own memories of Christmases in England, the cloudy sense of day, of old English houses with the fire chasing down the chill, the warren of passages, the kitchen clutter, and the village streets. The real purpose, however, yeah, that I felt.It was mostly curiosity as to how things would turn out for Elen and Stevie, what the dream means for Lyn, how the King Arthur legends tied in\u2026the real purpose of the story.And then the results of those dreams\u2026I never saw that one coming. I was all set for the fantastical, the paranormal, only to be pulled into the catholic.\"'God, no. Horrible things, scruples,' she said, with a shudder. 'They get in the way of my fun.'\"I do like that Bridget can actually be concerned where it counts.\"And it only took four tries to make the penny come up tails.\"It's an interesting introduction to James Swift. I had been expecting a rakish man prone to flirting, eating, and drinking, but Kearsley doesn't follow through on this. He's actually much better, and very, lol, underhanded\u2026in a good way. He will lead a lively dance.\nDid'ja know there's a difference between writers and authors? Oh, aye\u2026\n\"Authors are rarefied creatures \u2026 who write serious fiction.'\n'And writers\u2026'\n'Write books people buy.'\"\nEven more interesting is how Kearsley sets us up to believe that Bridget is the key, but in truth, she's the key who turns the lock that opens the door to the real purpose of the story: Lyn's future. Lyn has so much to get past. And Kearsley slips and slides it all in under cover of Bridget's desires, James' indifference, Christopher's and Gareth's competing interests, and Lyn as the pivot around which it all spins.\"Originality [is] not a team pursuit, and any story worth the telling grew in solitude.\"Oh, lordy, I did enjoy Christopher's comment over lunch at Owen and Dily's place about their son, and his\u2026how many was that?\u2026wife. And Dilys never picked up on it, although Owen had a snicker about it.It's fascinating to read a story and pick up on the background details like the red and the white dragon that I remember from Nicole Peeler's Jane True series and then G.A. Aiken's Cadwaladr from her Dragon Kin series. Kearsley reminds me that authors pick up inspiration from everywhere, and that history is a rich mine of materials.I kept laughing inside as Lyn dragged out that tour of Pembroke Castle, lol. And I cannot blame Lyn one bit at all for torturing Gareth.It's a slow, lazy read as the holidays slip from one day to the next, presenting opportunities to get to know people, to learn their fears and dreams, to explore the area, and to set the stage. When it comes, it's abrupt and will shake up your mind. For you will never have expected what comes.The StoryAlthough it goes against her workaholic nature, literary agent Lyn Ravenshaw lets herself be whisked off to Wales for the Christmas holidays by her star client, flamboyant children's author Bridget Cooper. She suspects Bridget has ulterior motives, but the lure of South Wales with its castles and myths and the change of scene will bring relief from the nightmares that have plagued her since the death of her child.But the dreams continue. With a twist, when an eccentric young widow thinks Lyn is her baby's protector.Before she can escape her nightmares, she must uncover the secret of these new dreams, from a long ago time that may not be that far away\u2026The CharactersLyn Ravenshaw is a literary agent for the Simon Holland Agency in London, haunted by the death of her baby, Justin. Her husband, Martin Blake, had been a novelist before he died. Patrick is her brother, and he and his wife live in Vancouver, Canada, where they both protest to their hearts' content.Bridget Cooper is a self-absorbed writer with her best selling Lalandrah series. She claims she's not an author! James Swift is Bridget's current boyfriend and a brilliant writer \u2014 Lyn thinks he's \"the closest thing to literary genius\". Christopher is his younger brother who sells antiques in his shop in Bath.Angle, Pembrokeshire\u2026\u2026is where Lyn will be spending Christmas. Gareth Gwyn Morgan is a famous (and reclusive) playwright who wrote Red Dragon Rising who lives in what locals still call Auntie Frances' cottage. Chance is his dog; Sovereign is his horse.Elen Vaughan, a free spirit without a spiteful word for anyone, is Uncle Ralph's tenant; she rents the other end of the trio of houses, East House. Tony was Elen's husband. Stevie is her little boy.Uncle Ralph and Auntie Pam own Castle Farm; they're really old friends of the Swifts' mother, but the Swifts have all known them for years. They spend time with their daughter up in Yorkshire. Owen is a fellow farmer who looks after the animals when they're gone; James minds the house. Dilys is Owen's wife, a woman with very firm opinions.Margaret is the blue-gowned woman in the dream.LondonLewis is Lyn's assistant. Graham is one of Lyn's co-workers; he works in the film and television rights department. Julia Beckett is a brilliant illustrator. Ivor Whitcomb is the \"Goliath of the London literary scene\" and a major jerk. He's currently James' agent.The Cover and TitleThe cover is peaceful with its pale blue sky framed in clouds with Lyn's dark brown hair floating down the back of her cream fisherman's sweater as she sits on a rocky wall, facing away from us and looking over the fields to the sea, the ruined castle of Pembroke in the distance. There's a ragged black edge thinly creating a border on the top and sides that reinforce the feel of looking in.The title is the fear, a dream of being Named of the Dragon, and the warnings it presents."}, {"userName": "Hayley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17415787-hayley", "userReview": "I just love how Susanna writes her stories and this one was no exception.

I am not sure I would give it 5 stars now but definitely 4 so will leave it. Her books are great reads for a lazy afternoon] I am already a huge fan of Susanna Kearsley's book and thought I had read them all. Then I discovered this earlier book of hers published in 1998. It is not rated as high on here as some of her others, but it just happened to be the right book for me! So five stars because I could not put it down last night until one this morning and could not wait until evening today to finish it. And as I always do with this author's books, I enjoyed every minute I was in it. Even in her books that were not favorites, I still just like being in the world she pulls me into. Most of her books involve time travel and thus history. No time travel here and it was a bit more of a mystery than the others I have read. It had a tiny bit of a feel of Mary Stewart's books here and there.So what made it special for me? I am a huge fan of the Arthur legend and of the medieval times in Europe. The setting for this book is in Wales at a rather secluded coastal village in present time. It is a land of legend, the ruins of ancient castles, and of superstition. A Christmas vacation time brings Lyn, a literary agent for a very large company, and one of her clients, the very eccentric and self centered Bridget, headed to Wales. Bridget has written a series of very famous children's books, and the trip is to spend the holiday with Bridget's current man in her life, another famous author, James. He lives with his brother in a castle like home. Lyn would like to sign James as a client, but is not going to push the issue when a guest at his home. Her company wants her to sign a reclusive famous playwright who also lives in the village. But these are side issues to the story.Backtracking a bit, Lyn, is a widow who had a baby boy after her husband's death and the baby died soon after birth. She does not mourn the husband, but has not gotten past losing the child four years earlier. She is tortured by nightmares where she is clutching a child and running from a dragon. It is her dreams and the coincidences that go along with them that brings us into legends and even Merlin.I have read some reviews of this book where the readers were disappointed in the characters or are Kearsley fans but did not like this book as well as the others. I can't say that for me. I did find Bridget pretty irritating, but that was the point of her character. She was a difficult demanding person to be around. I had trouble tagging it because it is a mystery. I really did not understand the dreams, the Arthur legend implications, the reason why a young mother renting part of the large house from Lyn's host and his brother was having some of the same dreams as Lyn was having. But that is not a mystery like a crime story. I tagged it as romance, but the romance is very subtle and does not really become open until the end. And speaking of the end, I did not have very much book left to read when I wondered how in the world this author was going to wind this up and have it make sense in so few pages. But she did!I could tell about the other characters in the book, but I don't like to do spoilers. Besides the people, there is a Jack Russell named Chance and a beautiful black mare too. It is a light read that put me in a really feel good world with a touch of paranormal, a bit of medieval history (which made me smile every time a tidbit of something I have read elsewhere or seen a movie came into the story). The writing is definitely the Susanna Kearsley that I love. I need to look around and see if there is something else out there that I have not found by this author."}, {"userName": "Suze Lavender", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29148122-suze-lavender", "userReview": "Lyn is a literary agent who's planning to spend her Christmas with her family in Canada, but then one of her clients offers her an interesting alternative.

James is looking for another agent, so Lyn is hoping to combine a lucrative deal with her holiday. Only she doesn't count on old emotions coming to the surface. Lyn has gone through something terribly sad and meeting their neighbor Elen and her young boy reminds her constantly of what she's lost. There's something mysterious about Elen's situation and her house. Is Elen just crazy because of grief or is there something else?Lyn loves going for long walks and is interested in a particular part of Welsh history because of some strange things that are happening to her during her stay. She meets playwright Gareth who's written a brilliant play years ago, but nothing ever since. He's moody, but interesting. She'd love to become friends, but she's only there for a short time...Named of the Dragon is a wonderful mysterious Christmas story. I love the way Susanna Kearsly writes, her words are beautiful. I really enjoyed the mythology aspect. Lyn's holiday isn't what she expected at all. It was great to read about the Welsh village and the history. I also liked the combination of main characters very much. They're all creative and have unique personalities. That made the story interesting. I enjoyed reading about all of them, but for me Gareth stood out, he's definitely fascinating.I loved the mystery aspect. I kept wanting to know more and couldn't put this book down.

I think my problem is the way the myth blended with reality, which, in my opinion, was choppy. I don't know if it wasn't enough myth, or that what was used was too vague, but I didn't feel a strong sense of \"rightness\".
