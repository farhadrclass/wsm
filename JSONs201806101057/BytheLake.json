In passages of beauty and truth the drama of a year in their lives and those of the memorable characters that move around them unfolds through the actions, the rituals of work religious observances and play. I loved the relaxed pace of this novel and the wonderful characters which include James and Mary Murphy who rarely travel from their local area; John Quinn, a notorious womaniser; Kate's uncle The Shah; Bill Evans, a farmer and James Murphy's brother who works at a Ford plant in England. The characters are so realistic that I was able to identify with characters I had encountered throughout the 80s in rural Ireland.Throughout the novel I was trying to place what year the story takes place as some parts hints at the 50s/60s and others the late 80s(which was where I would put it) and I think readers will make it fit the timeframe that suits them . The book is an extremely calming and relaxing read. It takes an honest look at Irish life in a small rural community and how local news and gossip played a huge part in their daily lives. It also deals with immigration and the struggles people have in everyday life and most importantly the beauty of the simple life. I especially loved the mood of the 80s Ireland and vivid descriptions of the changing of the seasons in the countryside. John McGahern really knows how to set a scene.I REALLY enjoyed this book and found it a nostalgic read. A word of warning! this as I have stated earlier is not a plot driven novel and its slow pace will not suit every reader.My only criticism would be that characters seemed to consume whiskey far more than tea and this was just a tad unrealistic in the novel!"}, {"userName": "Canadian Reader", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2103966-canadian-reader", "userReview": "This is a beautiful novel about Joe Rutledge, a native of Ireland, who returns in middle age to the country of his birth, bringing his wife, Kate. A lakeside house is purchased for Joe by his well-to-do uncle, fondly known as \"the Shah.\" McGahern follows the rhythms of the couple's life on their small, lovingly tended farm over the course of a year that sees many changes. The Rutledges' close friendship with their neighbours, the Murphys, is described with considerable nuance, and a range of other distinctive \"characters\" make their entrances and exits. All are graciously tolerated by the members of the community by the lake. One quibble: I had some trouble figuring out the time-period in which the novel is set. Was it the 1970s or early 1980s? It was hard to tell. So much of the farming equipment seemed to be from an earlier time. (However, that may have been just a reflection of Joe's predilection for doing things in the old way, as they were done when he was a child.) There was also mention, towards the end of the book, of telephone service coming to the lake--which caused me a little further confusion.I loved McGahern's lyrical descriptions of the natural world--which doesn't mean he glosses over its harshness. Likewise: human nature. He reveals it with subtlety, but does not sacrifice the truth. The ugly actions of some--like John Quinn, who badly uses women--are plainly presented.This is a rich piece of character-driven fiction, in which the rural setting is as much a character as anyone. I can see myself wanting to return to this book. There is just so much here to appreciate.Many thanks to my Goodreads friend, Mary Lou, for bringing this lovely book to my attention!"}, {"userName": "Cphe", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14907696-cphe", "userReview": "This is a gently flowing novel about the inhabitants of a small town in Ireland. It's a departure from my usual reading in that this novel certainly couldn't be described as either plot or action driven.There is however a wonderful sense of community, time and place. It's where neighbour looks out for neighbour. It's a community where everyone knows everyone's business and if they don't know it then they find out. There are a cast of characters all with their faults and foibles. It's not an easy novel to read and no doubt wouldn't be for everyone. Beautiful prose, very emotive at times with some of the characters and the hand that life has dealt them."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/343908-elizabeth", "userReview": "Loved it! Loved it! Thanks Ellen for the recommendation. This book seems to have a simple plot until you think about the emotionally charged encounters of the characters involved. A small community lives around a lake and their everyday comings and goings are chronicled by the author. The pace is slow. The members of the community are aware of the larger politics and larger world but they only serve as something to discuss. They really don't impinge on the closeknit relationships of these people. Yet, here is the interesting part. They are so careful and polite with one another--do they really reach depths of emotional connection? The answer is \"yes\". I find that idea appealing--that reticence and thoughtfulness are hallmarks of a better communication. The setting descriptions took my senses into high gear. The beauty of Ireland is described eloquently--even down to objects which makes you look at everything in a fresh way. As the daughter of Irish parents, I loved reading all the familiar Irish turns of phrase that are so familiar to me. I loved the Ruttledges--so quietly sensitive and helpful and choosing this life--I wanted to know them--I wanted to be like them! Favorite scene--will sound bizarre--was the preparation for the wake in the home--what a powerful description. Just a wonderful read!"}, {"userName": "Siria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria", "userReview": "I think it's best to think of That They May Face the Rising Sun less as a novel without a plot and more as a fictionalised anthropological study of rural Ireland. It's a lucid, serene rendering of the kind of place where I grew up: one governed by the rhythms of the landscape and circumscribed by social ritual and interdependence, by the striving towards modernity clashing with the old, old ways of things. McGahern's prose style is superb, sentences turning on the most precise and illuminating of details, and his ability to capture the rhythms of rural Irish Midlands speech is impressive. Every page brought me some new moment of recognition, new ways of seeing my home and myself. A wonderful, extended meditation in prose."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh", "userReview": "(3.5)\"Mary stood mutely gazing on her son and his wife as if in wonderment how so much time had disappeared and emerged again in such strange and substantial forms that were and were not her own.

His earlier, darker, sometimes-banned stuff gave him his name, but this is not angry or black. There's a kind of complexly layered but mostly tender account of rural Ireland given. Mam said it's the work of a dying man coming to terms with his life and country (he had cancer) and that makes a lot of sense. Very accessible and written in clear, simple, descriptive prose. It tells the story of an Irish couple who return home from England to farm a small piece of land on a lake in a northern bordered county. I don't think it names the county. As with the short stories, there's aspects of Irish life described here so cleanly and honestly I feel like something's being laid out that I've never had told to me before, but is totally recognisable and true. The conversations are natural and beautiful and uniquely Irish.A year passes on a farm. Farm things happen. Neighbours come and go. A shed gets built. The hay is brought in. Calfing. Why in God's name did I find this so comforting?The neighbours go on a trip to dublin and are nervous as they haven't spent a night away from home in seventeen years. I think this pushing it a bit until I realise my own granny is probably edging on that number, if not past it.It begins with a birth and it ends with a funeral. It made me think a lot about the life I want, and happiness, and family, and community. The soil."}, {"userName": "C.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1425694-c", "userReview": "I really wish I could enjoy this book, but it's driving me crazy. The slow pace, the stupid characters (by which I don't mean that the characters are badly done but that stupidity is part of their nature), the constant use of the passive voice, the sort of skaz (I don't know if I'm using this term correctly) in the narrative... it all combines to make an extremely annoying book.I see exactly what McGahern's doing (or I think I see it) and kudos to him, because it's brilliant. It is a continuous stream of anecdotes, an exercise in the minutiae of characterisation and plot. It describes a year in the life of Joe and Kate Ruttledge and their neighbours. We meet the spine-chillingly horrid John Quinn, we hear the sad tale of Johnny, we learn about Bill Evans' unhappy childhood... it's all fascinating and beautiful, in its small, humble way. The prose mimics the slowness of life in a place where little happens, but everything that happens is news. It's a beautiful depiction of a place and an era, though it's not immediately clear to what era it belongs.But I'm too impatient, and I can't like it. I'm constantly pressed for time at the moment, and I am unable to slip into the contemplative, relaxed state that I need to read this book. I thrive on tension, adrenaline, and that is something that has nothing to do with this wonderful book. I may finish it... one day."}, {"userName": "Kristel", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1993309-kristel", "userReview": "That They May Face the Rising Sun. This was a most delightful read. Not a story with a plot but a story of life, seasons passing, the years cycle frames their lives. The book is set in rural part of Ireland and is a portrait of a life in a rural lakeside community. It's the author's own place, sparsely populated corner of County Leitrim. Nothing much really happens yet it is full; haymaking, lambing, Monaghan Day, a wake. The story has repeating episodes of food, drink, the grey heron, swans, black cat and dogs. The Lake is one of the book's greatest character. This is a comfortable read and has less violence that Amongst Women but it is still there on the edge with John and the IRA man. A beautiful story set sometime after the war and modernization just starting to show up in the rural community with the telephone poles. The title of this book also has great significance and poignancy. There are so many great passages in this book and I am only adding this one to my review but really, there is so many more...\"completely alone though a part of the crowd, Mary stood mutely gazing on her son and his wife as if in wonderment how so much time had disappeared and emerged again in such strange and substantial forms that were and were not her own.

The characterisation of people like John Quinn and Jamesie and The Shah and others is beyond brilliant, though curiously the two people through whose perspective the story is mediated, The Ruttledges, are more pallidly drawn. A recurrent question is how well one might know a community without having been born into it. And an unstated question is how well the Ruttledges have understood the people they have been dealing with. Many of the stories come through the lovable Jamesie, yet I sensed these stories were contrived and incredible. And that suggests that the whole social glue of gossip and storytelling in the community described here is something more dangerous than the Ruttledges have noticed. Many critics see the book as light and lovely and pastoral and free of the darkness in McGahern's earlier work. Yet even the vision of the community as presented is dark and worrying - the lecherous Quinn, the IRA man undertaker that everybody knows is a bomber, the people pushed to the margins. Considering that McGahern might be quietly inviting us to distrust this whole picture suggests a vision darker still."}, {"userName": "Cher", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher", "userReview": "Synopsis from library:With this magnificently assured new novel, John McGahern reminds us why he has been called the Irish Chekhov, as he guides readers into a village in rural Ireland and deftly, compassionately traces its natural rhythms and the inner lives of its people. Here are the Ruttledges, who have forsaken the glitter of London to raise sheep and cattle, gentle Jamesie Murphy, whose appetite for gossip both charms and intimidates his neighbors, handsome John Quinn, perennially on the look-out for a new wife, and the town's richest man, a gruff, self-made magnate known as \"the Shah.\" Following his characters through the course of a year, through lambing and haying seasons, market days and family visits, McGahern lays bare their passions and regrets, their uneasy relationship with the modern world, their ancient intimacy with death.Released Feb 2015, 233 pages."}, {"userName": "Pip", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9837446-pip", "userReview": "What a wonderful writer is John McGahern. He launches the reader right into the lives of Irish villagers with his careful descriptions of social intercourse: \"'Patrick. You're shining', Jamesie held out his great hand .'The two of yous are a sight for sore eyes\" he said with perfect poise in the middle of the jostling and pushing in the crush around the ring. 'If you didn't leave your manners behind today you'd be walked all over'\". \"'Lots of money. Because I'm a topper,' he argued.'That's what Tom Casey told everybody after he married Ellen, who was a bicycle and ease and comfort to the whole country. 'Was I as good as the rest of them?' he asked her after he had performed on their wedding night. 'You were a topper', she told him. 'You were the very best.'\"\"'You're a pure imposter, Jamesie', Bill Evans said. 'That's right, Mary encouraged. 'Give it to him, Bill. Give it to him good-o.' 'Good man, Bill. You're dressed to kill. You'll land a woman for yourself today'. Jamesie said.\" The lilt and cadence of the Irish is there with all the colourful language and the blarney. With the way two men, who have worked one for the other for many years without ever speaking directly to each other, are described in all the awkwardness of one wanting to sell his business to the other, or the way Jamesie is studiously nonchalant about whether he receives help with his haymaking from his neighbours although it was of utmost importance to him, McGahern reveals his astute reading of human nature and his love for his countrymen despite their foibles.The place is evocatively described with equal felicity. \"When rain wasn't dripping from leaves or eaves, the air was so heavy it was like breathing rain. The hives were quiet. Only the midges swarmed.\" or \"Nothing was sharp. The lanes of watery light that pierced the low cloud from time to time seemed to illuminate nothing but mist and cloud and water.\" and \"Between the storms they had precious days of frost when the light was dry and clear and sounds carried. Thin ice glittered along the shore and clinked and chimed when there was any movement on the water.\"I seem to remember a review that stated that there was not much plot. I disagree. One character flogs a pony nearly to death returning from the church on his marriage and then rapes his wife in sight of the wedding guests! One character has been badly abused all his life as an orphan from England who is made to work on a farm in slave-like conditions. Then there is the incursion across the border from the Northern soldiers which massacres a Republican guerilla group. In retaliation an innocent farmer is murdered because he is Protestant. With all these horrors swirling around the hospitable nature of the Irish, always with a bottle of whisky on hand to ease the pain, or a few cigarettes for the abused farm-hand, is constantly emphasised.Altogether this is a wonderful book, describing haymaking with the worry about rain, and the sale of stock with the angst about the price one will get and the sorrow of parting with animals lovingly reared, and the easy camaraderie of the Irish pub where nobody is a stranger for more than a minute. And the title? All is explained at the end."}, {"userName": "Stephen Durrant", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1457001-stephen-durrant", "userReview": "A professor in our English Department recommended McGahern as \"Ireland's finest contemporary writer.\" Then last night a visitor from Ireland to our university, flabbergasted that I was reading McGahern, said that this was completely unlike his other novels, which are \"much darker and more strongly plotted.\" \"By the Lake\" is a character study and a tribute to the beauty of a lake in the Irish countryside. It has a dolorous tone but is not dark, at least compared to so many other things I've read lately. Moreover, McGahern writes with incredible skill. But I had a had time staying with it. My reading is done mostly late at night or in snippets I steal while at work, and I need either a solid plot or some exciting ideas to jog my memory from one reading session to the next. So I spent much of my time lost, trying to sort out one character from another and trying to appreciate McGahern's obvious love for the Irish personality and the Irish countryside. I do want to go to Ireland, but I wanted to do that long before I read this novel. I will, however, give McGahern one more chance at four or five stars, albeit not for a few weeks."}, {"userName": "Edel Henry", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30354027-edel-henry", "userReview": "A 4.5 star read for sure. I loved this book.The characters were so warm and likeable - I definitely laughed out loud at Jamesie's one liners on more than one occasion. McGahern's portrayal of rural Ireland is stunning with small events such as the death of a black sheep taking on profound meaning. One of McGahern's strengths is his ability to lure the reader into a false sense of calm with his pastoral reflections and disarm them moments later with the darkness that lurks underneath. The tale of John Quinn's first wedding jumps to mind here as a figure of ridicule is revealed to have a far darker and malevolent side.Such an easy but emotive read.

Where was the story? What was the point?\u2019 And I have to say that had the 1001 books list not pushed me deeper into fiction than I\u2019ve been comfortable going, I would have said the same thing earlier in my reading career.Now, however, I can appreciate literature that doesn\u2019t need a point, a plot or a polished ending. I can just appreciate it for what it is \u2013 literature pure and simple; writing for the joy of being written.McGahern is Irish and writes about a couple returning from London to a rural community in their native Ireland. That there is no point and no plot is the point and plot. This is Ireland, people. Life is life, and that is what the writing consists of. Beautiful, lyrical, this is an ethnography of a vanishing world.So, as I started out, I did find it a challenge keeping track of who the characters were. But when I finally twigged that I wasn\u2019t supposed to try, I could just lie back and let McGahern\u2019s prose take me along in its current. Reading the book before going to sleep each night was a perfect way to relax. The slow pace was accentuated by beautiful moments of poignant prose as small details of life and nature are described in delightful detail, such as\"The sun was now high above the lake. There wasn\u2019t a wisp of cloud. Everywhere the water sparkled. A child could easily believe that the whole of heaven were dancing.\"Gorgeous.As the couple get to know the inhabitants of their rural location, characters are fleshed out and there are moving moments as their fortunes ebb and flow with the community.I greatly enjoyed the calm wash of the writing. It was quite soothing.Those into Dan Brown\u2019s formulas, contrived plot twists and mandatory cliff-hangers at the end of each chapter, stay away from this book of real writing. You don\u2019t know how to read yet and will be confused. This is one for those of you who know what words are really for."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1783448-pat", "userReview": "A sample of the beautiful writing style.\"They could not live with him and they could not be seen--in their own eyes or in the eyes of others--to refuse him shelter or turn him away. The timid, gentle manners, based on a fragile interdependence, dealt in avoidances and obfuscatons. Edges were softened, ways found round harsh realities. What was unspoken was often far more important than the words that were said. Confrontation was avoided whenever possible. These manners, open to exploitation by ruthless people, held all kinds of traps for the ignorant or unwary and could lead into entanglements that a more confident, forthright manner would have seen off at the very beginning. It was a language that hadn't any simple way of saying no.\"Beautifully written and engaging. McGahern took everyday people and turned out a story of the political, social and religious aspects of Ireland as seen through their eyes. \"The water was silent, except for the chattering of the wildfowl, the night air sweet with the wild mint crawling along the scents of the ripening meadows, thyme and clover and meadowsweet, wild woodbine high in the whitethorns mixed with the scent of the wild mint crawling along the gravel on the edge of the water.\"A year of changing seasons around the lake and to the people who live there.

Thats the reason I chose it and the reason why I chose to abandon it after only 100 pages. It just wasnt for me.There is no plot, nothing happens, the characters are all interchangeable and in the few pages I read I neither learned anything about them, what motivated them and where they were going to go.There are no natural breaks in the book and the relentless prose just goes on and one until the point where I just couldnt take it anymore. An utter waste of my time. I remember trying to get through Ulylesses and meeting a similar end, but with that, I got to with 15 pages of the end.

I really could not get into much of the book, however, and was quite disappointed. Some clever phrasing, some characters very similar to those all around us; some glimpses of life that drive me crazy and some that I admire. Par for the course, I guess. There is something interesting to note, however.

Just the very fact that it exists and old men get drunk there makes for endless tales of rural joy and occasional moments of pain that are so intrinsically wonderful to tell in great detail that there is absolutely no need for anything to happen. At all. Kate and Ruttledge move back to Ireland from their nasty awful non Irish lives in London and then they grow a few plants and buy and sell a few sheep and that's pretty much it.

Different from McGahern's other novels, every word of this is rich, not a word used lightly. This novel is a tribute to simplicity, the everyday, honoring those who pass through life without fanfare or outward greatness. He shows the strength of friendship and community, and the ties that ritual bind. In portraying the normal, McGahern quietly wraps a cloak of acceptance around the reader of our unspectacular place in life, and it's cyclical never ending nature.His greatest work, and for me, the finest Irish novel crafted."}, {"userName": "Mary Lou", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6068952-mary-lou", "userReview": "This is a chronicle of a year in the life of a rural community in Ireland.

The rhythms of life are also marked by a heron which rises gracefully from the lake reeds to mark some utterly normal event of everyday life. The nuances of human relationships are symbolised by what he calls 'avoidance manners' from people who need to depend on each other and tolerate differences and not just the usual Catholic-Protestant divide at the nearby border. Jamesie, the notorious gossip and Joe Ruttledge play verbal games and Joe, returning to the town of his youth from a successful job in London with his wife Kate, moves into a hobby farm and contemplates retirement life if they can fit in. Ruttledge is the focalising character who shows exemplary patience to slowly gain the trust of those who never left.Jamesie's brother Johnny symbolises this dilemma with his annual return from England to spend summer holidays with Jamsie and Mary in their tiny house. This annual event is marked by a ritual lift by car to the further town's railway station and a pub crawl to celebrate before Mary welcomes him with the best sirloin to hit the pan. When Johnny is made redundant at Ford and writes that he would like to come home permanently, it is Joe who sees that Jamsie and Mary need him write a diplomatic letter to explain how this would never work out.The Shah, as Joe's Mercedes driving uncle is called, runs a successful scrap metal business in the old railway station yards in partnership with Frank who never talks with him, which poses another problem for Joe to solve when the Shah wants to retire and Frank is the obvious person to buy the business. Patrick Ryan lives alone in a remote farm and despite allowing his first house to collapse around him, is the local builder who has begun building a shed for Joe that might be finished some day in the distant future.In contrast with these reticent characters are the resident outsiders. Bill Evans is a former orphanage boy farm labourer, not the full quid and assigned by the priest to be dreadfully exploited by his 'betters', still as an old man hauling buckets of water up to the farm from the lake but calling in frequently to Joe and Kate as if entitled to his whiskey, cigarettes and a meal which he always receives.John Quinn boasts of his business successes but has numerous marriages. Everyone is invited to his third which causes a scandal talked about for years. They all leave the reception in disgust before even the food is served yet they all turn out for this fourth marriage and are polite to him in the pub. They wonder how his sons and daughters turn out to be perfectly respectable, pleasant people.I was reminded of Thomas Hardy's novels by the details of the farming, especially the calving, lambing and a brilliantly evocative scene at the annual cattle sales. McGahern excels in writing of these nuances of farming life and the closely linked relationships that make a community succeed. The quiet mood that he captures is a welcome change from the typical conflicts found in other novels with this setting. The agnostic Ruttledge is not bothered by the priest who explains that he has to make just one home visit to placate the bishop. The IRA Provisional bar-keeper and the detectives who take up almost permanent residence in a car outside, is one of those open secrets. In one of the best end sequences I have ever read, Ruttledge's acceptance by those who never left their town or farm is symbolised by an event that I will not disclose except to write that it beautifully encapsulates the meanings of the somewhat enigmatic title of this superb novel."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4599651-ian", "userReview": "Strangely beguiling and deceptively mellow novel of Irish country life. The Ruttledges have moved to a village beside a lake and their interactions with their neighbours form the bulk of the story. It isn't in truth much of a story, but the characters are singularly sympathetic: The Shah - local businessman and curmudgeon, James & Mary, kindly, nosey gossips, Patrick Ryan - the builder, who spends over a year failing to finish putting a roof on a shed, and even John Quinn - a charmer, forcing a succession of women to be humiliated at his hands. Universal themes of life, death and renewal are subtly woven into the novel, but so is the festering sectarian division that cannot be ignored as long as annual marches commemorate a bloody ambush. The warmth, the welcome and the ever-present hospitality of this bucolic life is the most lasting memory though."}, {"userName": "Jack", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16159568-jack", "userReview": "probably the highest rating i can give to a book that provoked a very personal anger in me.i doubt most people who might read this book will have the same experience, but all i can sayis that as someone who grew up in rural ireland, the truth and accuracy in the depiction of the characters in this novel is one of its greatest strengths. they spoke like my grandfather, and reading the novel was an entrance into my grandfather's frame of reference to the world. without saying much more, that's also why i disliked the book so much."}], "description": "With this magnificently assured new novel, John McGahern reminds us why he has been called the Irish Chekhov, as he guides readers into a village in rural Ireland and deftly, compassionately traces its natural rhythms and the inner lives of its people.
