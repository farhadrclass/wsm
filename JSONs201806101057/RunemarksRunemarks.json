She re-imagines the Norse gods and on occasion subverts them. Maddy Smith is the young heroine shunned by family and community. She was born with a new runemark on her hand denoting the gods. In her world, magic is perceived to be dangerous and banned. But here's the thing, Maddy likes doing magic.....particularly when it comes to some troublesome goblins!Maddy's only friend is Old One-Eye (Odin) and she finds herself being tutored on magic by him. A worried Old One-Eye wants Maddy to go on a quest to locate the Whisperer in the World Below. Upon entry, Maddy comes face to face with a familiar goblin. We go on to encounter shapeshifters, enchanted apples, magical creatures, a prophecy and the wonders and joys of Lucky (Loki), a smart, comic and infinitely complex god. Maddy has to stop the Nine Worlds from falling into chaos, and there is, of course, a battle. Harris has created an enchanting world. It is well written, although not always coherent, although this did not spoil my enjoyment of the book. There is a wonderful wide ranging cast of characters in an intricate and complex narrative. An entrancing, magical and entertaining read. It may not be the best of Joanne Harris but this is still great storytelling.

Why not  Zoidberg Runemarks? Rating could have been lowered but this was fast and fun read and it was perfect counterweight to complex Malazan series that was reading along side it. so i'm going to give it 4 stars. It's YA fantasy but it's more inspired by older heroic fantasy with than modern YA genre. Distinctive writing style that flows easily and setting heavily inspired by Norse mythology contribute to high rating."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "3.5 starsThe Nordic mythical foundations of this book were well utilised, conforming to known stories in parts and freely reimagined in others. The initial part of the book was especially well done; though it begins with the usual young protagonist coming into their powers, the runemarks and character of Maddy Smith gave it a real freshness and appeal.However, the book felt stretched, pushed well past the moment when all the reader's attention is firmly focused. By the time of the big battle conclusion, I was there merely to see how it all ended rather than being invested in the outcome. Joanne Harris usually has a much tighter plot than this and I was surprised by feeling this way about one of her books, especially as I thought this was for more of a teen audience. Perhaps i'm doing them a disservice in thinking that they have even less patience and attention than me... In any case, i'm not sure i'll be reading the next one in the series.Kindle copy received from Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie", "userReview": "This was a really fun way to spend some reading hours. It's YA Fantasy, which I wouldn't normally read, but Harris's style proved too seductive for me. She laid out a trail of breadcrumbs from the first paragraph and before I knew it I was deep inside the mountain, and the story. Caught, and mesmerized, there was no way out, but through it. I will admit to one or two brain spasms along the way as I tried to make sense of the complex Norse mythology, with which Harris deviates from the conventional storyline. But, given that it is all mythological who is to say after all, which is the better tale that's told? Harris's telling is beguiling.Maddy proves to be an enchanting young heroine -- all the more glamorous because she lacks glamour and instead moves with integrity, innocence and honour. What comfort to YA readers to know that one of their \"own\" is incorruptible, straightforward and strong!While a few other readers have commented that \"nothing happens\" and that Maddy is purposeless, I would beg to differ and suggest a closer re-reading: sometimes it's the journey that counts, and not the destination.Even from my more mature wisdom, this was an enjoyable read. When I put myself back in my 12-year-old body, under the apple tree, this book was positively delicious!"}, {"userName": "Alethea A", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1069643-alethea-a", "userReview": "I loved the movie Chocolat and I read a bit of Jigs and Reels, but nothing has hooked me on Joanne Harris as much as this! She started it as a story for her daughter, years later it is a fantastic tale of magic and adventure for all ages. The mythology is Norse, a nice break from the Greek gods if you've been devouring Rick Riordan's Olympians. So soon after reading Michael Scott's The Alchemyst, it's neat to come across more references to Yggdrasil, the World Tree. And if, like me, you love keeping track of a seemingly ever-expanding cavalcade of major and minor characters, and the minutiae of their lives and credos, then this is the book of the summer for you. Haven't run across this many characters since The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters. -+- After: Even better than I ever expected, and I had pretty high expectations. I hope she writes a dozen more of these! I think I've finally found someone to meet and exceed my Pottermania."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1480438-jane", "userReview": "My main complaint about Runemarks was the complexity. The narrative was far too extensive and unfocused. I don\u2019t know much about Norse mythology, so I found myself frequently frustrated with the intricate and complicated Norse histories.

I'll just say what made me decide on five rather than four.-YA WITH FEMALE PROTAGONIST BUT NO ROMANCE. (No, no potential love interests introduced either.)-Despite target audience, it is much less Bleached Underpants than many other interpretations of Norse Mythology. Also, no Black&White here.-The recommendation mentioned \"shenanigans\", but it's not as much about shenanigans as deception. Layers upon layers of it. It is clear enough not to cause a headache or blink-or-miss-it, but the hints drop just before the reveal so you don't have to spend pages rolling your eyes and wishing the character would get it already. -Also, it featured one my favourite kind of plot twist which I cannot name because it is a major spoiler and I really don't want to spoil anything here."}, {"userName": "Devann", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4135942-devann", "userReview": "HOW HAVE I NOT READ THIS BEFORE??? I mean, I know why, because in my opinion the summary for this book doesn't really do it justice. Or maybe it does, but it doesn't necessarily highlight the parts of the book that make it most appealing to me personally. First of all, I feel like the summary/cover makes this seem more like a middle grade book, but it is definitely YA. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind middle grade books, but with the complexity of the story here I'm glad it was aimed at a slightly older audience. Also this is YA WITH A FEMALE PROTAGONIST WITH ABSOLUTELY NO ROMANCE OR LOVE INTERESTS [POTENTIAL OR OTHERWISE] WHATSOEVER. What a breath of fresh air! Secondly, to me the summary reads like the book is going to feature Norse mythology but not feature the gods heavily I guess? I didn't know that Harris' The Gospel of Loki was also technically a part of this series or I would have realized my mistake earlier, but anyway the gods are VERY present in this. Pretty much all the major players make an appearance at some point but Odin and Loki are the main ones, and if you know me then you know how much I absolutely adore anything with Loki in it! In the end I thought there was a nice balance between the gods and the human characters and I really liked how all of their plots came together at the end. Also, I've seen some reviews from people saying they aren't very familiar with Norse mythology and that they find this book confusing. I can't really speak from that standpoint because I am apparently so over-familiar with Norse mythology that Neil Gaiman's new book last year literally bored me by it bringing nothing new to the table. However, this doesn't necessarily draw on that many of the actual Norse myths - it taking place AFTER Ragnarok and all - and mostly focuses on the characters so I would think a quick wiki list of Norse gods or something would give you most of the background you need. There is a character list at the beginning but it's basically 'all the gods and what Loki did to piss them off' so, while funny, it's not the most informative."}, {"userName": "Kyriaki",

She's not too perfect, but well-meaning, brave, daring, and affectionate without mush. She's not fluffy or weepy and she doesn't have an attitude. If in the one part she's momentarily whiny it's understandable and she stops very soon. And can she throw a mind bolt! ONE-EYE, Odin, is a puzzle to Maddy. Her friend, mentor; but is he only utilizing her?LOKI--unpredictable. Charming; scarred; a rogue; snarky to the limit, with a dark past. If you asked him if he cared about any one, or regretted anything, he'd deny it with a grin, and be lying. I defy you not to be hoping he stays on the light side, or glad every time he shows a bit of goodness.And the rest of the very large, very complicated cast. It would be spoilers to mention some of them. Let's just say that the author knows her myths, and there's a pot-bellied pig too.Plot: Read the book description for basics. The plot is epic. It goes on and on, picking up characters, places, themes. I can't say much without spoilers.Writing: Once in a while a character (especially Loki) speaks in a too-modern fashion. Apart from that, the writing is gorgeous, dark and funny, magnificent, gentle sometimes. It's not Rosemary Sutcliff, but it's very good.Content: Here are the problems. 4 S-words of one sort or another. I don't like vulgarity, and most books I read do not have it. If I buy this one I will use the black pen on it. Other words were p*** and d***, which don't bother me quite as much. Nothing sexual to speak of, some violence. Also the antagonistic Order seems to be a representation of Christianity, and the gods seem at times to be identified with demons. However, by the end, the Order's god is revealed, and is nothing like God; and gods and demons seem to be separate things. I loved the story and characters so much that I followed my friend Hazel's example and gave bonus points so it still is five stars. And finally, brethren: Suitable for perhaps 16+, or younger if language doesn't bother you or you have an obliging person to mark out the baddies; girls or boys.

Imagine, also, that the ancient runes have power for those that are born marked with them. Five hundred years after the end, much of the world is dominated by the Order, which has done its best to eradicate rune-magic and magical creatures of all kinds - with a thoroughness comparable to the Inquisition at its worst. But on the far side of the mountains from the Order's center of power, Maddy Smith has been allowed to grow up with an unbroken runemark on her palm - a mark that is not one of the old runes, but a new one. With Odin, Loki, and the prophet known as the Whisperer all pursuing their own goals, Maddy has to work out what her goals are - and hope that pursuing them does not condemn the world to another round of destruction This was quite a book, though I found myself a bit distracted by wondering how much was drawn from actual Norse myth and how much from Zelazny's Amber (or is it, how much did Zelazny draw on Norse myth?). But it's a fun book, aside from the occasional anachronism in the description or dialogue, with a thorough ending that's still open enough to allow for a sequel.

Not amazing, but not half bad either--the kind of rollicking adventure, with themes of self-esteem and rebellion against intolerant, controlling leadership, that seems to have taken the world of young adult literature by storm. I had already fallen in love with the subtle overtones of fairy-tale in 'Chocolat,' so when I discovered this, Joanne Harris' first excursion into YA fantasy lit, I picked it up and devoured it eagerly. To say that I was disappointed with the book would be an unfair exaggeration--but there's no denying it didn't hook me quite as much as Chocolat. Perhaps this is partly due to my utter lack of familiarity with the Norse myths that are the basis of the the story; but Runemarks' plot seemed loose and wandering, with new characters and plot twists introduced with such frequency, and so little explanation, that their significance was often lost on me.That said, Harris' characterizations are delightful. The Trickster Loki in particular is a deliciously cheeky, wickedly mischievous, roguish, irreverent, and impertinent scoundrel who, in true Joanne Harris style, single-handedly redeems the book from any plot pitfalls and keeps readers, like his cohorts, simultaneously laughing at him and wanting to strangle him, and unsure whether he is set to save the world or bring it crashing down into Chaos (which, despite Loki's family connections there, is NOT at all a nice place).What is missing, ironically, is that mysterious spark or zing--that flirting with the supernatural--that indescribable, but tangibly present, whiff of otherworldliness that brought 'Chocolat' tantalizingly close to the borders of Faery. Spells and cantrips--not to mention the eponymous runes of power--are as thick as fog in all nine worlds of the World tree, and gods and goblins run amok; but that magical quality in the former sense is markedly lacking. What made Chocolat so memorable was the way it infused everyday life with a mythical sense of wonder. Runemarks, on the other hand, brings the legendary down into the realm of the everyday. \u201cGod\u2019s just a word,\u201d Loki says, dismissing with a single gesture a world of awe and mystery. \u201cAnyone can be a god if they have enough worshippers\u2026 Just words people use for things they don\u2019t understand.\u201d Within the story, where the gods may turn out to be the enemy, this idea may be reassuring; but once that awe of the divine has been diminished, the world does seem a colder and less colorful place."}, {"userName": "Mels Ht", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20985735-mels-ht", "userReview": "I have mixed feelings about this book. I guess I'll start with the positive things about it. First off, it's well-written, the Norse mythology is accurate and it has quite an imaginative adventure. But...There were so many things happening all at once that I failed to get a firm grip on the story and digest it thoroughly. It felt like too much information for a single book- it could have easily been two books. Therefore, I did not feel I got to know the characters and process the story in a deeper level. I don't know about you guys, but I think that one of the most important things about a story is how well you get to know a character. In this book, I feel that the author merely skimmed the surface of her characters. Secondly, I feel that the story did not offer a full explanation of Norse mythology- its almost like you are expected to know about it already. Finally, and this is just my opinion, it stirred nothing inside me. Yes, it was a fun and entertaining read but that's about it. I don't know about you guys, but I like books that make me feel intense emotions- like empathizing with the characters. This book, did not do that for me specially because the characters, in my opinion, lack depth. It's good but I can live without it. :)"}, {"userName": "Rachel  Of Questionable Luck", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2443771-rachel-of-questionable-luck", "userReview": "AWESOME!

But of course, no one can forget the book's main character, the clever and brave Maddy Smith, a fourteen-year-old with a \"ruinmark\" (runemark) on the palm of her hand, an ancient and mysterious symbol that signifies the Seer-folk blood she is scorned for and the magic that she is able to preform.

Sometimes, I overreact to complications, therefore, this review may unintentionally be a manifestation of Chaos (nearly definitely). Secondly, I liked it [the book [Runemarks]] better the second time I read it. Thirdly, I liked it a great deal the first time, but something just didn't click. Fourthly, THIS BOOK IS THE PREEMINENT OF ITS CLASS. And that could be the end of the story, yet that would make an extremely poor assessment. Indubitably, this incessant rambling is the cause of greatest tire, so I find myself in the need to immediately portray my thoughts through use of my will to dominate the cunning of words. Shall we forthwith proceed onward? Good.I so very much liked the characters that I will start with them. First of all, some of them were very confused with their loyalties and that made me a little edgy with them, but that was completely my fault and they were probably in the right. Whom all do we have here? Um\u2026 Loki. A parson (quite likely not what you're thinking, at that) as well. Let's see, I'll just give it a long shot and list off some (I'll elaborate later)\u2026 there's of course the main character, Maddy (excellent character), One-Eye (a first-rate chap in his own way. And guess how many eye(s) he has?), Loki (this second mention is definitely necessary, for more reasons than one) (Loki is basically like Loki, but better, in a Loki-ish way. This is a paradox. There isn't more than one Loki. In a way, at least.), then there's the rest of the \u00c6sir and Vanir; excellent fellows, I'm sure. Which brings us to the question; is Thor and his hammer or an old lady with her walking stick more powerful? Hard to decide, isn't it? But you get to find out\u2026 sort of. Also, there is good old Mimir. Yep, that poor fellow. And then there are a lot of creatures and humanoid beings that are less than charming (one's in a constant state of being literally half dead), and then there's Skadi. Yes, that Skadi, The Huntress, hater of Loki. Are you starting to get the picture? Loki and Skadi in the same paragraph is never a good sign. For characters in the story, that is. For a reader, it's one of the best. There's also Adam Scattergood. Of course, he's a troublemaker. Due to my experiences, every time I see the name Adam on a page, I become fairly certain trouble is ahead. I couldn't forget the pig, of course; best of swine, I'm sure. And I shouldn't forget to mention that really poor (not by way of monetary means; unfortunate is a synonym) but great creature who appears at the beginning of the book\u2026 but I won't elucidate about him and this sentence probably won't help you any. Did anybody mention the giant snake? Oh, wait, I'm the one \"talking,\" and, according to my research, I didn't. Guess who's scared of snakes? Hint. It isn't a whole bunch of the characters. Hint two. Really, really scared of snakes. Hopefully, that wasn't helpful. You really should read the book yourself to find out this stuff. I tire of talking about characters now, so let's move our good attention vertically at a descent forthwith! If you're moving horizontally, there may or may not be a problem.Was the plot good? Affirmative. In fact it was a monstrously well done plot. It is also the most twisted (for want of a better word; twisted sounds more formal than twisty) and complicated plot you've ever seen. Maybe. Of course, just the fact that runic magic along with the spoken word is being utilized makes the whole thing interesting. And then you take in the aforementioned characters and a host of others, and it starts becoming nonnegotiably (this isn't an accepted word?) fascinating. And then you add the setting, and it gets so good your dog might get excited (which would be\u2026 bad). Hold! Add the setting first. What would the poor characters do without good solid mass to place their feet on or oxygen or nitrogen to breath or ozone to consume the ultraviolet rays from the sun? It's horrible. Can you tell that I wrote some of this review at 3+ A.M. in the night? Back to the review. So, basically, there's this youth denominated as Maddy. She is not exactly ordinary and she lives among a people that live by a set of standards and try to avoid contact with the unnatural, to put it one way. What I've just said covers such a small portion of the boundless plot. This could be an entire plot, with development, of course, but, oh no. It goes on. She meets this chap with one eye, strikes up a \"friendship.\" He has her go down underground and try to fetch something. This causes all kinds of events (too numerous to explain). One of these, though, is the waking of some people. Poor people. And then there's this person who appears in the readers stretch of \"vision.\" Then a great deal more bizarre things happen. There's a poisoned handkerchief, many plots (strategic schemes, that is) thought out by many different people (hence the poisoned handkerchief), and a pig in the Underworld. But, isn't there just being a underworld and over-world too simple? It is and this was remedied\u2026 but I won't tell how\u2026 I believe, however, that you can guess. Yes, I can conclude, saying that this was a decidedly complicated, interesting, and enjoyable diegesis. Conclude this section, that is\u2026 I must needs communicate my thoughts upon the writing.The writing was done proficiently, both in style and turn of phrase. It did the job of carrying the plot and projecting the characters expertly, to the extreme happiness of the reader and no small amount of merit to itself. It was very captivating and all that good stuff.And then the novel falls just a little short of its mighty potential. The characters use some pretty rough vocabulary sometimes. I'm afraid I won't be much help with giving you a general impression of what sort of words, for the same in the copy I read were covered in ink, black and blue.As for in-book content, this brings us immediately to the discussion of the magic (or glam) used. The idea behind it is most interesting, having, as I said before, Runic magic along with cantrips. It doesn't really tell how it all works, but that, as usual, is very much acceptable. Runes are cast, which is very interesting, no? This is an amazing concept. It really is. Just think about it for three minutes. It, it, and only it; and you'll start to see just how amazing. The runes, of course, have meanings, and there is a great deal of them. Very good. Cantrips, of course, are uttered. That's all fun stuff too.Alright. In conclusion, five stars, definite recommendation, the good's beefy folds of flesh monstrously outweigh the bad. This book includes Loki. Very, very, wonderful book. You should read it (that was my recommendation, by the way). And so ends my review and soon it shall pass into memory (sort of)\u2026"}, {"userName": "Stephanie - Adventures Thru Wonderland", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15308827-stephanie---adventures-thru-wonderland", "userReview": "So, so, so good! I have always been big on Norse mythology, but have never really read many books about it. When I found this series, I couldn't wait to get started. I was hesitant at first, since my library only had it on audiobook, but now I'm SO glad it ended up that way! This is the first audiobook I finished, and it was much better than the first one I tried! I loved the narrator's voice, and she did an amazing job with the characters and I could easily picture the character's faces based on the emotion in her voice! This book was so fun to read (well listen to) that it is now one of my top favorites, AND on my must-buy list! I'm also hoping to pick up Runelight and the Gospel of Loki soon, since neither are at my library. I loved the characters and while retellings, especially of mythology, have been done before, I enjoyed this one, and have yet to read another like it! This is now to me what Percy Jackson was when it first came out!

Nessun motivo in particolare, proprio prima impressione a pelle.E un'altra cosa: nonostante abbia letto ben due recensioni, ero convintissima che si trattasse di un urban fantasy... quindi ho passato un certo numero di pagine a chiedermi dove e quando fossimo.La risposta \u00e8 abbastanza semplice: sul quando, siamo qualche secolo dopo Ragnarok. Sul dove... siamo in un mondo fantasy generico, che mi ha ricordato un po' Mondo Disco (sempre per il motivo che al mio cervello piace fare connessioni completamente random) tranne che la magia \u00e8 IL MALE: in seguito alla fine del mondo il mondo non \u00e8 finito, si \u00e8 \"solo\" riassestato. Le antiche divinit\u00e0 sono morte o divenute ombre di s\u00e9 stesse; tutto ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 legato al vecchio \u00e8 una minaccia per la nuova magia, ma il nuovo ordine \u00e8 pericoloso perch\u00e8 vuole essere unico e totalitario, e pertanto mira ad infrangere l'equilibrio.Che dopo aver letto tre fantasy sai gi\u00e0 che \u00e8 una pessima idea anche se non ti spiegano nel dettaglio perch\u00e8.La cosa interessante \u00e8 che ad infrangere la situazione di stallo venutasi a creare nel corso dei secoli non sono i cattivi ma la protagonista: Maddy, 14 anni e reietta nel proprio paese per via di una troppo spiccata propensione a usare la magia, \u00e8 destinata ad essere l'ago della bilancia nella lotta tra vecchio e nuovo, e per esserlo deve dare il via ad una sequenza di avvenimenti cos\u00ec folli che nessuno sano di mente lo farebbe volontariamente (e diciamocelo, se hai un piano a cui persino Loki dice di no perch\u00e8 non ha senso, hai un bel problema tra le mani).Maddy \u00e8 una protagonista che ho amato un sacco: tanto per cominciare \u00e8 una ragazzina che si comporta da ragazzina, \u00e8 matura come possono esserlo i bambini. Ossia prendendo un sacco di decisioni sbagliate.Rimane quella con l'atteggiamento pi\u00f9 normale ma questo perch\u00e8 le divinit\u00e0 hanno un'et\u00e0 media mentale che va dai 3 ai 5 anni: alla fine mi aspettavo che Maddy avesse una crisi di nervi e facesse presente che, nel mucchio, la bambina era lei. Ho trovato ben gestiti i suoi poteri, nel senso che li ha, sono grandi ma non li sa usare: per tutto il libro la si vede generalmente lanciare in avanti la sua malia contando sul fatto che \u00e8 essenzialmente l'unica a cui funziona ancora del tutto (i vantaggi di essere nati dopo Ragnarok... ), ma per il resto personaggi con pi\u00f9 esperienza sono in grado di farla a pezzettini piccoli piccoli.Ad affiancare Maddy nelle sue avventure c'\u00e8 Loki, che vuol dire che io ero contenta e Maddy non tanto perch\u00e8 cosa c'\u00e8 di meglio che affrontare La Fine del Mondo 2.0 in compagnia di un trickster dio del caos, che incidentalmente ha causato La Fine del Mondo 1.0?Loki l'ho amato: un demone adottato da Odino come fratello, portato ad Asgard e l\u00ec disprezzato da tutti perch\u00e8... beh, perch\u00e8 si comportava da demone. Ad ogni modo questo Loki non \u00e8 un grande incompreso: s\u00ec, gli \u00c6sir non sono stati molto carini con lui, ma lui \u00e8 stato insopportabile nel migliore dei casi.Apprezzo un sacco gli autori in grado di scrivere i caotici neutrali in modo credibile, e questo Loki, pur non essendo l'esempio migliore, si piazza molto bene in classifica. In pi\u00f9, il suo rapporto con Odino mi ha un pochino incrinato il cuore.Ci sono un sacco di comprimari, e un difetto pu\u00f2 essere il loro numero: a parte Loki ed Odino (pi\u00f9 Thor), che pi\u00f9 o meno si sa chi sono, c'\u00e8 tutto il pantheon norreno che francamente non ho mai sentito nominare salvo qualche eccezzione (tipo Hel, e il cielo sa quanto ho fangirlato per Hel) che \u00e8 trattato in modo molto macchiesttistico. Beh, non proprio. Diciamo che se fosse un film, loro sarebbero i personaggi da affidare a caratteristi bravi.Ed \u00e8 un peccato, perch\u00e8 la Harris \u00e8 brava a coinvolgere il lettore, per cui almeno io ho trovato fastidiosa la fretta con cui molti personaggi sono stati trattati perch\u00e8 sono certa che sarebbero stati bellissimi. Per esempio avrei pagato per saperne di pi\u00f9 della famiglia di Maddy, di come vivono la caccia alle streghe scatenatasi contro di lei.Il ritmo del libro \u00e8 strano: \u00e8 lungo, ma mentre vai avanti con la lettura sembra che le pagine siano troppo poche per risolvere tutto ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato messo in moto, che la storia proceda troppo lentamente per poter avere un degno finale. E in effetti un po' \u00e8 cos\u00ec: se la Harris riesce a trovare il modo di integrare il cattivo finale senza farlo sembrare un boss sbucato fuori dal nulla di un videogame, il modo in cui questo viene affrontato \u00e8 poco convincente e troppo veloce. Per contro, tutto accade nel mondo di Hel, che \u00e8 una location cos\u00ec figa che fa passare in secondo piano tutto o quasi. L'alternarsi dei punti di vista, poi, permette di seguire in modo completo la trama e la piacevole sorpresa \u00e8 che c'\u00e8 anche il pov del cattivo. Saranno pure personaggi sgradevoli, ma mi piace vedere come corre il criceto nella loro testolina... ma i cambi sono abbastanza bruschi, e sinceramente all'inizio mi hanno lasciata un po' perplessa.In sostanza, si \u00e8 trattato di una lettura estremamente piacevole, che ho amato nonostante i difetti e di cui non vedo l'ora di leggere il seguito."}, {"userName": "Yana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4416856-yana", "userReview": "Joanne Harris... well, it was a love at first word with her and has been so ever since. I have NEVER read a book by her and felt disappointment, regret or mixed feelings. She is a unique human being that has been blessed with the magic of writing and brings joy to the world with ther storytelling.This is Joanne Harris's first novel for young adults. Its the story of maddy Smith a fourteen year old girl who lives in the distant future in a world entirely different to ours. Maddie is born with a mysterious rune mark on her hand which in her world is considered a very bad omen.The novel which is quite long for a childrens novel relates Maddie's adventures as she crosses over into the different worlds. On her journey she encounters many colourful characters including norse gods. No-one is quite who they appear to be and who actually can Maddie really trust! There are lots of twists along the way. Joanne Harris in this book demonstates her ability as a storyteller. Although I did feel that she did not explore the character of Maddy strongly enough that said a very readable story. I also would have wished for Loki's character to be a bit more... Well, Nordic... Ever since I read Lachlan's Wolfsangel I have been spoiled by the way he portrays Loki, and so far every other portrayal falls flat for me. I just cannot live with the idea of another Loki, who is to be different to that, which is of course absolute non-sense, for Loki is a shapeshifter above all. But alas, I am a humble human.On the bright side Joanne Harris' writing style is as strong as ever and it is easy to get involved in the magical world she creates. It is all very tongue-in-cheek with humour that owes a lot to the influence of Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett. It is easy to read and enjoyable as ever. But I find it a bit less influencial than her other works. Nothing can beat the Five Quaters of the Orange or Chocolate for me. It is still very good, although a tiny bit inferior the rest of her novels.It is again a crossover book that any age group with a penchant for fantasy and magic will thoroughly enjoy. This is a re-release of the original book which was published in 2007 but this version has an epic, artistic and mythology based landscape on the cover which is absolutely stunning (it is also hardback which is a bonus). I am a huge fan of Joanne Harris so thank you to Gollancz for providing me a copy of the book to devour almost immediately."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2089593-jason", "userReview": "Review for Parents by Strict Christian Parent (contains spoilers)I thought this book was subtly devious and subversive. I regretted allowing my 12-year-old son read it. And the ending wasn't very good.I read this book because my son read it, and I wanted to see what it contained. You can get a summary on your own, so I'll just explain what I didn't like.The fantasy novel has as antagonists a group of people that are modeled after the Christian religion that are amorally evil, and who derive their power from the same \"magic\" that the Norse Gods do. It even has a book that they follow called the \"Good Book\" and an evil man called \"The Pastor\". The \"Order\" follows an \"Unnamed\" supernatural being that ends up being a selfish power-hungry entity that wants to destroy the worlds so he can rule it.This author of this book chooses to model religion, especially the Christian religion, as an organization that creates rules to give power to the leadership, rather than as a body that brings joy to it's followers. The organization outlaws dreaming and imagination and such, claiming it to be a source of evil in the world, and parallel to witchcraft.Fiction is enjoyable because it is believable. If it's not \"real,\" it's not very good fiction. This is a problem because exposure to false principles through fiction can impact and form one's perception of reality, especially for children. If a youth reads a thousand books, and all of them portray mothers as evil, destructive people, then the youth will be much more likely to accept that as truth, even if the books aren't true. This is the problems with many pieces of fiction today. They take a wonderful entity, the Christian Church, that has been the source of so much good in the world, and demonize it, claiming that it is okay because \"it is only fiction\". This book is a perfect example of that.This book does the same thing with relative morality, teaching that what is good at one time is evil at another, and vice versa.The ending was a poor one, as well. The chief antagonist spends five hundred years preparing to take over the world, and the culminating events of that preparation (the climax of the book) are very shallow and difficult to believe as \"real\". Not nearly like the battles in the Harry Potter or Leven Thumps where the battles are based on solid strategy and feel real.All in all, not worth reading."}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131995-hilary", "userReview": "We're all familiar with the author who lives in denial of their genre writing (\"It doesn't have spaceships in, so it can't be science fiction!\"). Joanne Harris is somewhat the opposite; for years she's been slyly slipping fantastic elements into her otherwise resolutely mainstream fiction and getting away with it. Here she goes for all-out fantasy, and it's a sad reflection on the publishing world today that in order to do so she's had to have it marketed as YA. This is a lovely book: a joyous, irreverent romp through Norse legend, full of verve, humour, action, adventure, and the most dangerously charming Loki you're ever likely to meet. At almost 500 pages it initially looks daunting, but Ms Harris's timing is impeccable: the action is divided into bite-sized chunks, and every section ends with a punch that makes you want to keep on reading.[return][return]My one criticism is that the young female protagonist, Maddy, who is initially the novel's main POV character, finds herself more and more squeezed out as more and more characters are introduced  in particular Loki, against whom nobody stands a chance  and appears rather colourless compared to the Norse pantheon.

But I've got to admit that right from the start the writing was dull and I knew this book and I weren't really going to get on. Seriously though there is practically no suspense in this authors writing and the characters are not likeable or believable.I'm new to Norse mythology and could have done with some background story about the major characters. I'm not saying there was absolutely no background story but what story there was was just so complicated and heavy. So around 160 pages I was like \"Fuck it!\" and gave up. Anyone who's looking at this book wanting some mythology should read the Percy Jackson series as they're brilliantly written.

Esta hist\u00f3ria um dia saiu da gaveta e tornou-se uma hist\u00f3ria de m\u00e3e para filha, uma hist\u00f3ria que Joanne lia e adaptava para a sua filha Anouchka, uma hist\u00f3ria divertida e privada at\u00e9 a filha de Harris a convencer a public\u00e1-la e assim nasceu A Marca das Runas.Publicado em 2007, e reeditado agora pela ASA, editora da autora em Portugal, este \u00e9 o primeiro volume da duologia de fantasia da autora de Chocolate, uma s\u00e9rie juvenil que n\u00e3o deixa de apresentar a profundidade sombria de Joanne mas que cont\u00e9m divers\u00e3o, mitologia e aventura e, mais uma vez, o combate entre magia e religi\u00e3o.Maddy nunca foi uma menina como as outras. Renegada desde a nascen\u00e7a por causa da marca que apresenta na pele, Maddy \u00e9 uma estranha na sua pr\u00f3pria casa, olhada de lado pelos que a viram crescer, diferente em todos os aspectos, ela sonha com outro mundo, onde n\u00e3o seja uma estranha, um s\u00edmbolo de algo que \u00e9 temido e h\u00e1 muito esquecido\u2026 mal Maddy sabe que algo est\u00e1 mudar, que o que est\u00e1 adormecido voltar\u00e1, que a magia est\u00e1 mais entranhada nela do que alguma vez ela pode supor e que est\u00e1 na hora de ela cumprir a sua parte nos des\u00edgnios do destino. Encarregada de uma miss\u00e3o, ela parte para o desconhecido e descobre que as f\u00e1bulas que o seu mentor lhe contava s\u00e3o mais reais e perigosas, que existe um inimigo que est\u00e1 prestes a torn\u00e1-las nada at\u00e9 ao esquecimento absoluto, que ela pr\u00f3pria \u00e9 muito mais do que aparenta. Numa guerra onde o Caos e a Ordem se enfrentam mais uma vez, inimigos tornam-se amigos, aliados mudam de lado e uma Nova Era pode morrer antes de puder crescer.Autora que brilha em livros esot\u00e9ricos de alguma estranheza e muita complexidade, Joanne d\u00e1-nos este A Marca das Runas, um livro juvenil de fantasia, muito diferente do seu estilo habitual mas que n\u00e3o deixa de surpreender, nem que seja pelo lado refrescante e divertido, jovem e espirituoso, uma faceta desconhecida da autora, cujos livros pontuam, por regra, pela densidade e obscuridade. Numa linha mais simples mas com a mesma escrita envolvente que perde o seu lado tentador pra um mais ing\u00e9nuo e sat\u00edrico, a autora de Chocolate mostra que quando se nasce com um dom se pode escrever qualquer coisa, at\u00e9 uma f\u00e1bula de aventuras, demandas e objectos m\u00e1gicos. Mas desenganem-se se pensam que este livro \u00e9 uma leitura b\u00e1sica e banal, muito pelo contr\u00e1rio, est\u00e1 repleta de segredos, profecias e liga\u00e7\u00f5es obscuras que se unem numa narrativa de ac\u00e7\u00e3o r\u00e1pida e momentos \u00fanicos que nos levam a ler a toda a velocidade. Onde as gargalhadas s\u00e3o sempre bem-vindas, o inesperado acontece nos momentos menos prop\u00edcios e o cora\u00e7\u00e3o se aperta quando s\u00f3 queremos que tudo acabe bem, a mitologia n\u00f3rdica ganha outra gra\u00e7a e dimens\u00e3o, uma vers\u00e3o mais colorida, trapaceira e trapalhona que nos faz voltar \u00e0 idade em que acredit\u00e1vamos em tudo e em que o entusiasmo era quase infantil e extravagante. Mesmo assim, como sempre, a autora n\u00e3o nos deixa de espantar com a forma como o Bem e o Mal s\u00e3o uma \u00fanica e s\u00f3 moeda, como ambos os conceitos se entrela\u00e7am e desmontam dependendo da perspectiva de cada lado, mostrando que por baixo da cor e risada h\u00e1 uma mensagem mais profunda do que transparece a um primeiro olhar.Tamb\u00e9m este livro \u00e9 marcado pelos temas habituais. O conflito entre a religi\u00e3o e a magia, a f\u00e1bula e a realidade, a ordem e o caos, pautam toda a narrativa, onde as coisas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o t\u00e3o lineares quanto aparentam e que s\u00e3o apresentadas de uma forma t\u00e3o imaginativa pela autora, que cada descri\u00e7\u00e3o nos faz viver os acontecimentos, deixando a nossa mente voar mais longe pelas p\u00e1ginas ao encontro das mil\u00e9simas tarefas que Maddy e companhia cumprem ao longo da sua jornada. Em cada momento nota-se que este \u00e9 um livro feito por divers\u00e3o, um livro para extravasar ideias, para fazer rir e abrir os olhos mas com a certeza que respiraremos de al\u00edvio no fim, pelo menos at\u00e9 ao pr\u00f3ximo livro. As pr\u00f3prias personagens s\u00e3o tal como a narrativa em que se inserem. Ing\u00e9nuas, rezingonas, ir\u00f3nicas e divertidas, um grupo para nos animar e enternecer que colocar\u00e3o at\u00e9 ao fim da leitura a vis\u00e3o Marvel longe das nossas mentes. Desde os deuses aos habitantes da aldeia, cada um apresenta um conjunto de caracter\u00edsticas que nos impedem de odiar profundamente e apelam ao perd\u00e3o e isto, sendo um factor que algumas personagens de Joanne chegam a apresentar em outros livros, acaba por ter a sua certa ironia porque estas personagens s\u00e3o t\u00e3o menos pesadas e intricadas que apelam desde logo ao nosso lado bom. Sem deixar de ter aquela marca inimit\u00e1vel de Joanne, A Marca das Runas \u00e9 um conto para a fam\u00edlia, um livro em que podemos voltar atr\u00e1s no tempo, sozinhos ou acompanhados mesmo dos mais novos. Sem a complexidade e mist\u00e9rio mais envolvente t\u00edpicos, este livro \u00e9 para se desfrutar, para descansar a mente das coisas tristes, para ler sempre com um sorriso. Uma leitura pitoresca e colorida que mesmo n\u00e3o atingindo a soberba dos outros romances de Joanne traz, sem d\u00favida, uma inoc\u00eancia e do\u00e7ura que se deve recuperar, mesmo de vez em quando."}, {"userName": "Jessica Draper", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2590468-jessica-draper", "userReview": "Fair-to-middling fantasy. It's nice to see a book based on Norse mythology, but it would've been nicer if the book had been better. Joanne Harris is British, and the tone is extremely British, which is odd with the Norse gods running around--as were the occasional anachronisms in the way the characters talked, modern sarcasm and irony (\"Duh!\") that clashed with the medieval/old-timey setup. It also felt like Joanne had written a couple of scenes before she had the entire storyline in mind or had chosen a 14-year-old girl, Maddy, as the protagonist--the tone and focus shifts suddenly, and the sequences feel \"older\" than the rest. For example, one of the big moments of the climactic confrontation turns on a weirdly modern \"men and women have totally different expectations\" conversation, complete with the woman thinking \"Men!\" This, while Chaos is busting loose and all the Nine Worlds are in peril? With all the focus shifts, it felt like Joanne couldn't quite decide which of the characters she wanted to concentrate on, or how she felt about them. She clearly likes Loki, however, which makes him one of the more engaging characters; because he's the Trickster, and supposed to be charming, she gave him more lively dialog and initiative. The other Aesir and Vanir come across as little more than name dropping, there to fill out the myth more than to really \"live\"--on the other hand, their behavior certainly mirrored the myths. They are all stupid, treacherous, selfish, and argumentative; real people wouldn't have stayed together so long without actually either making friends or coming to blows, but that's very common for the allegorical figures in myths, right? You've got the pantheon, and each of the gods have to act in line with their assigned roles. Thus, Thor's always a big bruiser, Freya's vain, etc., and none of them have souls so much as they have parts to play. That two-dimensionality clashed with the way Joanne treated the human types, who did react emotionally, change their minds, and follow logical consequences. For example, the humans quickly learned to distrust and fear Skadi, who'd proved herself not just dangerous but a literal maneater, but by the end, the \"gods\" seemed to forget or disregard the fact that she'd betrayed and tried to kill them. Psychic dissonance! The biggest problem with the plot came from these \"because I said so\" interactions. The emergence of a villain who not only had amazing telepathic powers but also managed to gather a vast army of followers threw me out of the story, because Joanne never explained how the heck he managed to do it all, or why anyone would follow him, or why nobody had noticed after all these years. Yeah, big surprise, but definitely on the \"What?!?\" side rather than the \"Wow!!\" side. Maddy's feeling of relief and happiness at the end of the book comes out of the same area of left field--after everything that's happened, her conclusion that she's finally got a \"family\" was absolutely bizarre. These people had spent the entire time either ignoring her, arguing, and trying to kill each other--and she's glad that she's part of their group? Logic, clearly, is not the book's strong suit. But one brain-itching part of that illogic does come from the mythology itself. Everybody's fighting, Loki's afraid of getting killed, nobody wants to die--but we spend a fair amount of the book actually in Hel and Netherworld, where all the dead are stored (can't really say they're living there), and several of the Aesir (including Loki) have actually been dead before. So where does this fear of death come from? Given the setup, dying is more like getting misdirected--instead of ending up in Asgard, you're stuck in the Black Fortress until you can figure out a way to escape, or until somebody comes and frees you. Which makes the \"deaths\" of two characters in the final confrontation even weirder: if you go to Hel when you die, but you die in Hel, where does your soul end up? If there's no more than the Nine Worlds, where else is there to go? It doesn't say that the soul (or Aspect, to use the term in the book) is utterly destroyed, but it also doesn't explain how a soul can end up someplace other than the Underworld.But then, metaphysics aren't really the book's strong suit. For the villainous Order, it feels like Joanne lazily copped bits from Anglicanism without the actual doctrinal underpinnings, and everybody uses \"gods\" as an exclamation/expletive--including the gods themselves--without any kind of reference to an actual divine belief. So why would everybody use that particular term? It's the kind of careless writing that hurt the book for me."}], "description": "Master storyteller Joanne Harris has created a magical and epic romp\u2013 a fresh, funny, and wonderfully irreverent new take on the old Norse tales, sure to be enjoyed by readers young and old.Seven o\u2019clock on a Monday morning, five hundred years after the end of the world, and goblins had been at the cellar again. . . . Not that anyone would admit it was goblins. In Maddy Smith\u2019s world, order rules. Chaos, old gods, fairies, goblins, magic, glamours \u2013 all of these were supposedly vanquished centuries ago. But Maddy knows that a small bit of magic has survived. The \u201cruinmark\u201d she was born with on her palm proves it \u2013 and makes the other villagers fearful that she is a witch (though helpful in dealing with the goblins-in-the-cellar problem). But the mysterious traveler One-Eye sees Maddy\u2019s mark not as a defect, but as a destiny. And Maddy will need every scrap of forbidden magic One-Eye can teach her if she is to survive that destiny.", "title": "Runemarks\n      \n          (Runemarks #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/633446.Runemarks", "average": 3.73, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1322757188l/633446.jpg", "reviews": 844, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9432.Joanne_Harris", "name": "Joanne Harris"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/633446.Runemarks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2444163.Runemarks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32707914-runemarks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1814387.Runemarks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7077215-runemarks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18514533", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34845702-runemarks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1877314.Runemarks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9696323-le-parole-segrete", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17451943-a-marca-das-runas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47401.Chocolat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15096.Five_Quarters_of_the_Orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15101.Blackberry_Wine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15102.Gentlemen_and_Players", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2227371.The_Girl_with_No_Shadow"]}
