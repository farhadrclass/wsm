The second half was much better to listen to than the first. Grace was one kick ass chick!Prior comments3.5 stars. Which is a good rating. Since I enjoyed the previous story about Shea's abilities I figured what the hell and read this one even though it is even more far fetched. But I liked the story of Grace and Rio. The reason for the average review is that I thought it was a bit weaker on the character development side. Can't give lots of details on what I wanted, it just did not tick all of my boxes.

Grace has the ability to heal people, something that is painful to her since she absorbs that person's disease. To save her sister Grace cut their mental link and now she has escaped from her captors, injured and on the verge of giving up when Rio's team gets to her.Grace is pushed beyond her limits to survive and Rio doesn't coddle her instead makes her take strength from her reserves and they take shelter in his house in Belize until further arrangements can be made. He also knows that Titan is also on their trail. Titan is a special ops group who at one point was led by Rio. Rio was an idealistic solider who joined Titan and did everything they said, dabbling in shades of grey and then he started questioning it. He let his parents think he died and then found his pregnant sister beaten by her husband and she died, he avenged her but his parents couldn't accept him back, so he joined KGI where he had more control.This book had insta-love, Rio saw Grace on tape and wanted her to be his, I kind of didn't get this. Grace is pretty much broken so much so that she wanted to die at one point but Rio helps her.I found the book kind of sugary as far as the romance is concerned. There is betrayal as well from someone in Rio's team who needs Grace's abilities. At the end of the book we find out that Titan had another objective, the world thinks Grace is dead so she has to be careful all her life, remain hidden in Rio's house and they acquire a daughter as well(of the man who wanted Grace to heal her).I am a fast reader but this book took me a long while because I kept getting distracted by other things.

She\u2019s on the run, she\u2019s incredibly weak from being held captive and being forced to use her gift of healing on numerous people. She can heal anyone by taking their injury or disease into her own body and using her accelerated healing abilities to fight off whatever it was she took in. She has her limits and death isn\u2019t something her ability can keep away and she\u2019s at her limit now. She\u2019s alone, running from men who want to grab her and use her healing power, but if Rio has anything to say about it, he\u2019ll find her first and keep her safe from everyone. When we last saw Rio in Whispers in the Dark, he had taken one look at Grace on a surveillance video and knew he had to be the one to rescue her. Grace\u2019s sister, Shea, was already being watched over by the man she loves, Nathan Kelly, but Grace was out there alone and had no one. Rio tracks her down, helping her recover and regain her strength. The threat to both Shea and Grace is still out there but Grace is the one they want now. A man desperate for his dying daughter to live hires a group, Titan, to bring Grace in to heal his cancer stricken young daughter. Rio is very familiar with the group Titan, and knows they\u2019ll stop at nothing to complete whatever mission they\u2019ve agreed to. Failure isn\u2019t an option for them and Rio along with KGI and Steele\u2019s team, plan their attack to make sure Grace and Shea can live their lives in peace. I liked the relationship between Rio and Grace. Rio is very alpha, very much about protecting Grace and keeping her safe and he\u2019s felt a connection with her since the first time he saw her on the video. Grace has been through hell. Her \u201cgift\u201d causes her so pain, but the guilt she feels when she sees a sick child or someone that she knows she can help drives her to do more than she really should. Throughout the book, Grace is constantly recovering from helping someone. Grace has also lived a very solitary life. She\u2019s never gotten close to anyone other than her sister Shea and with Rio, she experiences a lot of firsts. Their romance felt very much like a whirlwind. There were definitely some swoon worthy moments between the two, but one thing that I\u2019ve never been a big fan of is a declaration of love after only knowing the person for a few days. It happens between them and I understand how intense and emotional their scenes are, but it still felt a little fast. As it was with Shea and Nathan, there is still the element of Grace\u2019s telepathy and she and Rio can speak to each other in their minds. I could take or leave this and really in the end, if felt like the things they were saying in their minds mirrored what they were already saying out loud, so I\u2019m still a little puzzled as to why this storyline was brought into the series in the first place. They\u2019re not on page for long, but I have to mention P.J. and Cole and how much I\u2019m looking forward to their story. P.J. is a smartass, tough and even in just a few short pages, they made me laugh and cheer and I\u2019m so looking forward to them leading their own book. The story takes place primarily at Rio\u2019s home in Belize. There\u2019s a ton of action in the first part of the book and Rio\u2019s team is front and center during all of it. I liked getting to know his team members and put personalities with a few of the names. That said, since this was Rio and Grace\u2019s show, the Kelly family was MIA for almost the entire book. They\u2019re there in the background, in the form of KGI, but I missed the big Kelly family scenes. And yes, I absolutely get that it wouldn\u2019t have made sense to have that in Rio\u2019s book, he\u2019s a part of KGI, but he\u2019s definitely a man who takes orders from no one, including Sam and KGI. We do get a nice big family scene at the end and a well-deserved moment for Shea and Grace. I overall enjoyed the story. Personally, I needed to look at this as a story within the KGI series, but very separate in its own way. Rio is very sweet with Grace and he shows a different side to the Rio we\u2019ve known in prior books. He\u2019s still that same hard, leader who will do what it takes to get the job done, but he\u2019s more emotional with Grace and let\u2019s himself feel love and be loved for the first time. Rio and Grace had a nice romance, I just wish the pace of it had slowed down a little or had more of a time passage. This book can certainly be read as a stand alone and fans of the KGI series will enjoy getting to know Rio a little more up close and personal."}, {"userName": "Smut Junkie", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7935793-smut-junkie", "userReview": "FRIGGIN LOVED IT! It's probably best if I just start out by saying that I adore this series and ALL those hot KGI men, the entire Kelly Family and all of the women as well! If there was a book series that I could throw myself into, it would be this one, but how ever would I choose which guy I wanted?? LOL! ;)Anyway - you got a fair idea of Rio in the previous books and at the end of the last book you got a tiny sneak peak of Grace, the sister of Shea. I knew going into it that I would love it because I was pretty much crushing big time on Rio before I even opened this book up! I love a big, bad-ass guy, who will do anything in his power to protect an innocent...and when he has a heart of gold and a super soft side it's just all that more appealing. I had about 80 pages left in the book and I put it down because I was getting really anxious and KNEW that the big bad event of the book was about to happen and I was really stressing out about it. Grace had been through so much horrible stuff and my heart just broke for her so many times throughout the book. And after you get a little more of Rio's back story you heart breaks just a little bit for him too. And you KNOW that they can't loose each other...and damn that Maya Banks for stressing me out like that!! I also KNEW there would be a HEA, cause there always is, but I was really feeling upset this time around. I finished this at the pool and had to put my sunglasses on because I didn't want anybody to see my CRYING! Yes, really, I was crying! Now I am stuck waiting for the next installment of the KGI series, which is Cole and PJ's story, which I have no doubt will be pure awesomeness!On a side note - I pre-ordered this from Amazon and as I was reading today half the book fell out of the binding! That makes me VERY unhappy!! No brand new book should do that!

Please. It will drive me nuts.Thank you!My first impression of Rio from an earlier KGI book: Luckily my impression has changed.I love this series. It requires me to occasionally suspend reality, but most of the activities seem to be somewhat within the realm of possibility (then again, I'm no military/mercenary expert). This story took that realm of possibility a little too far, and in my opinion it was lesser for it.Grace Peterson is a telepathic healer. She can absorb another person's illness or injury and leave him or her healthy. She is also able to read others' thoughts and communicate with her mind. This was my biggest problem with the book. After reading Shea and Nathan's story, telepathy seemed to be special and was a feature of their relationship that made them so good together. In this book it was used too much - how was Rio special when Grace could have made such a connection with virtually anyone? I was also a little bit afraid that having Grace be able to read everyone's mind was almost like taking the easy way out and not having to write the characters well enough to portray their strengths and weaknesses without that mental tap.I really liked the other aspects of the story. My impression of Rio from the other books was thrown on its head, as he was much less the machine than previously written. The double wedding was kind of cheesy, but whatever - the parts with the whole Kelly family are a little cheesy.Overall it was a good read for fans of the KGI series, and I eagerly await the next.

The action remains high through most of the book with plateaus of peace to give you a breath as Grace heals for one reason or another. She is a stong woman and her character development at least in determination is well thought out by Banks. The brain link reunion with her sister Shea is better than the actual reunion on the wedding day...not saying whose wedding.  Rio is the brooding alpha hero we all love and he doesn't let you down in any way. I am beginning to feel an ever so slight lack of sustainable interest from Banks in this book. By that I mean, there is some of Banks usual passion missing here. Barely percievable. Is KGI beginning to run it's course? Hope not. The next book is P.J. the hot alpha chick on the team.Rio saves Grace from her captors and takes her back to his hidden hideaway in the jungles of another country. Grace shows unbelieveable strength in walking away from her captors, literally, at Rio's side. Can not help but call her one strong lady. Later the evil bad guy wants her captured again to save the life of his dieing daugher Elizabeth. Does he get his way or not. That is the thread through much of the story. Of course he does, Grace goes and then desplays her incredible stategic thinking. Then she does her thing at a cost higher then I had expected. Bit of a surprise there at the climax of the story. Always good. The HEA was perfect, first with family and friends and then on their own. Only one thread left dangling at the end of this story. One that I really don't care one way or the other about.

LOVE THIS!!I have to say this right off the bat, I FREAKIN LOVE RIO!! Seriously, love him (giggly, I would swoon at his feet if he were real) love him!!! And I am 50! how ridiculous and embarrassing is that. lol... This story is about Grace, Shea's sister from book 4 Whispers in the Dark, two sisters that are telepathic and can heal others. Grace has been on the run, having escaped the people who were holding her and torturing her, forcing her to heal people despite what it does to her physically. She is weak and near death and running in the mountains of Colorado. Rio and and his team are on a mission to find her and bring her to safety. Rio and his team work for KGI run by Sam Kelly (*swoon*). Throughout the previous books in this series I never got a real handle of what this guy was about. Always in the background getting the job done. What I learned in this book was that he is a scary, hot, badass, kinda guy. I mean the guy lives in the jungle! But what seriously pushed me over the edge was his enlightened attitude. He knew he needed more than strong muscles, but a smart, trained mind. And of course there was his tender, loving heart. (ok I am babbling, cuz i am crushing on him so much). What I also loved about this book was the action of course, I could picture myself marching through the jungle, ready to kill the baddies!! What i missed was the Kelly brothers, They were not in the book much, but on the flip side I really enjoyed the men in Rio's team. What I also liked was the way Grace evolved, frightened, running, broken. She finally decides enough is enough of people using and abusing her and she starts to kick ass!!

I loved Rio! Rio and Grace may a great couple and to me one of the best books in the series so far. Grace had been on the run for over a year, separated from her sister and trying to stay out of the clutches of someone after her. She has the ability to heal people and there are governments out there that would do anything to posses her talents...even her own. Rio is the man that has volunteered to bring her home to her sister Shea. But before Rio could get to her, she had been captured. By the time he did manage to get to her, she had managed to escape her captors, but was still very weak from healing sick person after sick person. She was put through some pretty horrific situations. I liked Grace and thought she was a good fit for Rio. Rio is MB's typical he-man alpha with a tortured past, but a really awesome cook. What is not to love? I enjoyed the book and don't mind the paranormal element. What did bother me was I think Resnick got the shaft and I don't see how what went down can stay down, especially with Shea knowing the truth. I don't know why he was kept out of the picture there at the end, but do hope someday he gets his own story, because to me his is a very lonely man. I am not sure what the point was of keeping him away from Shea and Grace. I do hope that Swanni and Steele get their stories soon. Also I hope we hear from bad-ass bad boy Hancock again...that is going to have to be one special woman to take him down and find his heart.

I wanted this to be my favourite book of the series \u2013 as it features my favourite character of the series (that would be Rio) \u2013 and it is. In all its lovey-dovey, seriously dramatic glory, it is. While I prefer straight suspense to paranormal suspense, if you like Christine Feehan\u2019s very popular GhostWalkers series, then this is in a similar style.I really think you should read the book before this one first. I couldn\u2019t tell you if Echoes at Dawn would hold up on its own, as I\u2019m too familiar with past storylines to determine that.In this one, Rio \u2013 a mercenary of sorts \u2013 and his team have been sent to rescue Grace Peterson (of the supernatural powers), who is on the run from bad guys trying to imprison her and use her for experiments. They catch up with her just as she\u2019s about to fall to her death in Colorado.From there we have some chapters where Rio and Grace get to know each other. Grace\u2019s magical powers mean her injuries heal nice and fast, clearing her schedule for a few chapters of sex. Lotsa, lotsa, lotsa sex. There\u2019s a whole chapter just for Grace to experience Blow Job 101.Then everyone becomes cosy and declares their love and respect \u2013 and some more love \u2013 for each other.Then the action picks up again and they go off to shoot some more people. Something bad happens to someone we\u2019ve known from the beginning of the series, and that was really awful to read. He\u2019s supposed to not be the greatest guy, but I have a real soft spot for him!I\u2019m not sure if Banks knows this, but (in my opinion at least) she writes suspense better than anything else. Her suspense chapters get to me more than the romantic chapters do. That first third of the book that took place in the forest was amazing. I was happy to have less of the Kelly family in this one, because they\u2019ve taken away from the exciting parts in other books (yes, I know, the series is called KGI \u2013 the \u201cK\u201d standing for \u201cKelly\u201d!). I really liked the focus on Rio and Grace, without having to be interrupted by fussy, interfering Marlene Kelly every second chapter.But then, I just really like Rio all around. I like his long hair. One of my favourite things about him is that he doesn\u2019t baby Grace the way some of the other characters would have. I was really worried his real name \u2013 finally revealed in this book \u2013 would turn out to be something super-dorky, but it wasn\u2019t.On a completely random note, these books use the term \nwhat all she\u2019s endured\n a lot. It\u2019s not an expression I have ever heard before, but all of the characters (even Brazilian hero Rio) use it. Maybe it\u2019s one of those Americanisms that has slipped past my notice until now??I remember many readers being worried in the GhostWalkers series when books #4 and #5 switched focus to a different team of different men \u2013 much like what happens with this book in the KGI series. As with the GhostWalkers though, the switch of focus actually made for a stronger book. It was something of a clean slate; we didn\u2019t have to spend half the book catching up with everybody from past books, which gave us more time for the main story.Echoes at Dawn is one of those guilty pleasure reads. You go in with certain expectations because of the genre, and it delivers on all of them. I still prefer my romantic suspense without magic in it, but this is definitely my series favourite."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6538604-nikki", "userReview": "OMG!!! I love Maya Banks! This is one of my all time favorite series and I am thoroughly happy with its latest installment! I have to admit, with Whispers in the Dark I was taken by surprise with the paranormal element (and I love paranormals by the way), which even at the end and even though I loved the book, I was still unsure how I felt about it. Same feelings applied to Echoes even though I was eagerly waiting for its release date! That being said, this book fu*#in rocks! I have been interested in / intrigued by Rio from the first and when I found out he was getting his own book I was thrilled! This book was just as awesome as the rest and I don't even know where to begin!

Grace is so broken, mentally and physically that she's at her wits end, about to give up when Rio swoops in and gives her something to live for. While reading this today, I updated my status periodically with some of my favorite lines from Rio, and I must say I think I'm in luurve! :) In Echoes at Dawn, we see a side of Rio that has never before been seen up close and personal!

At least that's what I thought every time he showed up in this series before. Then he made it his mission to go after Grace Peterson and rescue her. Well somehow between that decision and what went down in this book he lost some of that alpha appeal.This book started out strong for me and slowly fizzled out some of the charm. At times it felt we weren't getting much progression in the overall story although there was a lot of action.Grace seemed a lot stronger and ended up being a more delicate type of heroine, even though still stronger than her sister Shea in my opinion. Grace and Rio still worked well as a couple though, him being the strong protector and relying on her powers at times and there was still some spark. As a couple I have to say I liked them a lot better than the previous book. Although the romance might've felt a bit rushed, and I would've liked their connection to develop through a longer period of time. Rio was still a pretty strong hero even though he was toned down from what I expected.And then there's the Kelly's...this is not a Kelly family book. They were mostly absent in this story and I expect the same from the next book as well. I do expect the next book to be a little more to my liking, being that it's PJ and Cole.

I was bummed that there wasn't as much Kelly family as I would have liked but then this is Rio's book. Loved all the action and all the calm moments between Rio and Grace.

Also something was bugging me about the whole thing. Its not even a big deal but some reason it has been bothering me. See Browning and his woman claimed that Grace wasn't forced to help but in fact she was. At least in the beginning, when you are tricked and being held in an iron grip that leaves red marks and he say I wont hurt you but I will if I have too then pulls a gun on her, isn't that force? Yes she helped of her own free will when she found out why he did what he did but still. For some reason this bothered me in a big way. Ok whatever Im over it seriously. lol"}, {"userName": "Vanessa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9740086-vanessa", "userReview": "I don't know what I expected of this one but i was still between the lines on it. Honestly, I expected more from it because I enjoyed Nathan & Shea's book a little too much. I expected more from Grace especially since she was a huge concern in the last book. I certainly expected more communication between her and her sister. I think I would have liked more interaction between her and Rio as well, I mean, besides the fact that the both saved each other I didn't feel the connection that I felt between Shea and Nathan. Even with all that I still gave this book 4 stars . Why ? Even though It felt lacking in some areas. Who am I to kid? I love a good love story. And that it certainly was. Also I don't know if it was just me, but I predicted a pregnancy in all of this. No? =D HAPPY READING . :)"}, {"userName": "Pamela(AllHoney)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/884792-pamela-allhoney", "userReview": "The fifth addition to the KGI series. The story continues where the previous book, Whispers in the Dark, left off. Rio volunteers to find Shea's sister, Grace and he does. Of course there are lots of bad guys chasing after them so they have to hide. That gives our couple time to get to know each other. lol. I wasn't feeling this one as much as the previous books in the series. I'm not sure why but it didn't grab me like the others. I liked it well enough and will definitely keep it and continue the series."}, {"userName": "MountainKat", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3916434-mountainkat", "userReview": "*4.5 Stars*Another great installment in the KGI series! I loved reading about Rio and Grace! But it didn't move me like some other books in the series have. I did admire Grace's strength and courage. It was amazing to see her have such compassion after everything she had endured. I can't put my finger on why I didn't connect with this book as much as I had hoped, but I still devoured it and really enjoyed it though! I just dread waiting for the next one - thank goodness for the novella we get soon!"}, {"userName": "Suzi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22800029-suzi", "userReview": "jebenica od knjige"}, {"userName": "Ery", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5152904-ery", "userReview": "DNF- not my book.

It was nice to get the conclusion of this story arch in back to back books. Grace and Shea have a paranormal ability to heal. With Grace, she takes on the other person's illness or wound upon herself and that person is healed. It can be mental, cancer, knife wounds, GSW... This makes Grace a highly sought after person, and I don't mean in the I-want-to-pay-you-for-your-services kind of way. She's hunted. She's captured. She's use in experiments. Later in the book she find out exactly why a particular person is so determined to capture her.I liked Rio and Graces story and relationship. Like with the Kelly bothers, Rio is the tough, alpha, I'm in charge kind of guy....but he has a soft underbelly for the woman he's come to care for and love."}, {"userName": "Marianchu", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27509501-marianchu", "userReview": "Me siento un poco decepcionada.

Grace pasa a ser bastante sensiblera y llorona y Rio neandertal con el m\u00eda y lo que yo diga.... lo que no pega para nada con el principio del libro....Me ha resultado cansina la narraci\u00f3n de las escenas \u00edntimas, demasiado largas y detalladas, llegando al punto de aburrirme (sip, aburrirme)Creo que el desarrollo de la segunda mitad del libro no ha estado a la altura del inicio sobresaliente y el final tampoco porque se vuelve a repetir el patr\u00f3n de los libros anteriores, as\u00ed que me encontr\u00e9 desgraciadamente con ganas se terminar la historia :(A pesar de ese inicio de 10 y de lo mucho que me gustaban inicialmente los personajes, a la historia completa no puedo darle m\u00e1s de un 6,5."}], "description": "Grace Peterson is desperate, in hiding, and on the run after escaping a shadowy group determined to exploit her extraordinary ability to heal others.
