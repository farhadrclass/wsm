Which ends badly. And just when we give up and develop that prickly outer shell, we find that one person who is our missing half. Perhaps I am reading too much into this, but I like my assessment.

Hug Me is a book about a small cactus named Felipe, who lives in a family that is not very affectionate like he is. In the middle of the book, Felipe befriends a balloon, but it doesn't go well, and he moves out of his home because he doesn't feel like he belongs there anymore. Felipe lived all by himself until he heard a cry of loneliness, like he had felt before when he wanted a hug. In the end, the book ends with a happy ending, with Felipe and rock hugging and becoming best friends forever. I really like how they expressed certain individual's appearance may not be approachable with a cactus, and how they can actually want some love with others. Maybe one of us or people around us is a cactus, someone who just needs a warm hug."}, {"userName": "Mackenzie Fawcett", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6088497-mackenzie-fawcett", "userReview": "This book is not bad, but unfortunately it is not great either. It tells a story about a cactus that wants to be hugged (adorable premise), and I love that the language is not too elementary.

That's how Felipe the young cactus feels, but his family just isn't the touchy-feely kind. Cactuses can be quite prickly sometimes you know . . . and so can Felipe.
