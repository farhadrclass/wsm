He just keeps walking in the belief that his journey will save her life. I wanted to shout \u201ckeep going Harold!\u201d, to remind him of the adage \u2018absence makes the heart grow fonder\u2019 because Harold\u2019s journey was testament to its truth. A journey just as much about having the courage to reflect back as about going forward. Solitude forces him to open the door to his personal demons. Simply walking requires behavior that\u2019s totally out of character; an ability to connect with both nature & mankind. He draws the strength to keep going from his new found awareness of nature's intricate beauty. The humanity of random strangers, those \u2018great unwashed\u2019 he\u2019s spent a lifetime tuning out, offer insight and comfort. Harold had abided by the British unspoken rule not to ask for help, yet it is constantly offered, and with such civility!I loved this book on so many levels. It\u2019s unapologetically sentimental though not cloyingly so. It\u2019s a great adult love story that deals unflinchingly with the challenges of lifelong commitment. It focuses on the value of friendship, humility, self-forgiveness and human kindness. And it\u2019s a tremendous 1st novel which I\u2019d love to see performed on stage; this would make for a fabulous play.\u201cit never ceases to amaze me how difficult the things that are supposed to be instinctive really are\u201d"}, {"userName": "Lisa Kay", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2459470-lisa-kay", "userReview": "Found at The Sunday Edition:The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is the story of one man's faith in his feet.

At one point in this book I was out reading, sunglasses on to cut the sun\u2019s glare, and the story gripped my heart to the weeping point. Do I go in so my neighbours don\u2019t see? But I\u2019m wearing my sunglasses. Yes, but the tears are falling from under the sunglasses and rolling down my cheeks.I did come in from outside (no tissues on my balcony) and then I thought, if Harold Fry is brave enough to walk so many miles and is not fussed about what people think of him, why can\u2019t I sit out on my balcony and cry about his story?As I was reading, I really did want to hug this book \u2013 and I still do. Even more, I want to hug all the characters in this book.This is indeed a love story. It is about love of spouses, love of children, love of parents, of neighbours, of friends who made sacrifices, of strangers with hearts alive with their own loves. It is also about love of nature, of the plants that feed us, wild and domesticated; and it is about love of beautiful sunrises and sunsets, of springs and myriad shades of green.This book is also about the fractures and fissures that love creates while building itself.At first I could not imagine how a pilgrimage could take up an entire book. As I read, I was reminded that a pilgrimage is a journey, and as with any journey that any person undertakes, they bring themselves along. Their thoughts, their hurts, their tender moments, and the bitter.

How I lingered over this book; read it slowly to truly savour and appreciate the story. The author doesn't try to impress you with pretentious words nor does she bamboozle you with a convoluted plot. It's an unembellished story. The 'hero' is not good-looking or rich; he's a simple man who embarks on the journey of a lifetime. I loved the absolute clarity of foresight into the mind and heart of a very ordinary man. Harold is an unobtrusive, tentative and unassuming person; he has been that way all his life. Now in his 60's, he is filled with regret; feels loss about situations he is no longer able to change. Since his retirement a few months prior, he has done virtually nothing but sit, much to the chagrin of his wife Maureen. Harold and Maureen's relationship has, over time, become one of simply sharing a house; rarely speaking and no longer even sharing a bed. The portrayal of their life together filled me with sorrow; two people in their 60's living together but each in a terrible aloneness. One ordinary day, he receives a letter from an old work colleague, Queenie, who is in a hospice. He sets off to post his reply but upon reaching the post box, realises that a letter is simply not enough. Queenie has been a friend, someone who stood up in defence of him; Harold feels that as Queenie had once 'saved' him, now he will save her. So he decides to walk to visit Queenie. It is indeed a pilgrimage; a walk of faith. He truly believes with all his heart and soul that his walking will save her. Each day he walks will be one day longer that she lives. I've been in Harold's position albeit with a loved one but I didn't walk; I cleaned. So I understand Harold's mission. I know just where he is coming from. The belief Harold has in his walk is infectious; as I read on, I found a little voice in my head saying in my head: 'I hope she lives, I hope she lives' . Although his walk is basically a solitary one, he has some, mostly, wonderful encounters with strangers. He feels their tenderness towards him and as he realises \"he feels his own tenderness towards them\u201d. For the first time, \u201che realises that we are all alone, just putting one foot in front of the other\u201d. But a solitary walk from one end of England to the other gives much time for retrospect. There are contemplations on his life with Maureen, painful reflections on his relationship with their son David and of course thoughts of Queenie. And, with no intent on his behalf, he becomes a minor celebrity: as he encounters people and towns, they cheer and barrack him on. This spurs him on with renewed vigour. Having said that this is a lovely read, I will add that I found the last couple of chapters a bit harrowing: the letter to The Girl at the Garage and what he finds at the hospice particularly so. The ending is bitter-sweet; but I'm glad it was. I smiled in places and I cried in others; a big lump sat in my throat for the last ten or so pages. Ultimately, Harold loses something but also finds something else that he has longed for. Rachel Joyce doesn't offer a warm, fuzzy read; your spirits will soar and they will plummet. If you're going to read anything, then read this wonderful book. Who knows, maybe we could all use a pilgrimage of our own?"}, {"userName": "Lynne Spreen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3448260-lynne-spreen", "userReview": "I just finished this lovely book, and I'm never going to forget it. To those who say nobody wants to read about \"old people\", I'd say, read this book. The fact is, as long as you're alive, you should be open to growth and change, right? But how many of us stop growing after middle age? We find a formula that works and we stick with it, missing opportunities to experience joyous awakening. Maybe we start saying things like, \"I'm too old to do X any more.\" And we shut down, close off. We fail to notice the continuing wonder and miracle of life.In this story, a couple in their 60s have made their peace, of sorts, following a horrific event in middle age. They live together, married in name only, settling for having another person in proximity (to take out the trash. To do the laundry. She snaps at him, he looks away.) The author conveys emotion so skillfully, not overwriting by one syllable.Then, something happens, and the husband, Harold, begins a journey both mental and actual - he sets off on a walk from the south of Great Britain to a point 500 miles north. I won't tell you if he makes it or what happens, but I will say that the story was so good, I put it in a class with Gilead by Marilynne Robinson. This author, Rachel Joyce, has achieved this miracle: she describes the sweetness and difficulty of life in such a way that you can't separate the two, and are a better person for having realized this fact.Many thanks to Ms. Joyce for this winner."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2635637-jennifer", "userReview": "stil mulling this one. sometimes i really liked it and other moments i was...a little bored. there was definitely an overuse of \"put one foot in front of the other\" that verged on becoming a drinking game. the premise of the story is lovely but it did get a bit schlocky and mitch albom-y for my tastes. mentions of both facebook and twitter in the book were curious.edited to add (pasted in from my comment below, in case people don't read the comments here):you know, the further i get from reading this book, the more it is sitting with me in a way that is far deeper than i originally stated. it's an introspective story and deals with a lot of issues quietly - but i have been thinking about the story off and on for the last several days. i think it would make for a really good in-person book club discussion.i had the chance to meet joyce and hear her read and talk about the book. she's a lovely woman and believes so strongly in harold that you can't help but wish the very best for both of them.as far as the booker: it would be very interesting if she/it won. it's not the typical book for booker - it's a simple & sentimental story. but, it's touching a chord with many, many people. that shouldn't sway the judges though. it's a tremendous achievement to have accomplished a longlist spot with a first novel. amazing!!"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5143619-michael", "userReview": "Harold Fry has never done the unexpected, having spent the last 65 years living a quiet sheltered life. Retired for the last six months Harold shaves each morning and puts on a tie only to sit in the same chair with nowhere to go as his wife Maureen silently cleans. One day he recieves a letter from an woman from his past who informs him she is dying. Harold pens his reply only to be disappointed by his response so he makes a snap decision to walk across England from Kingsbridge to Berwick Upton Tweed to save her.With nothing but the clothes he is wearing and the small supplies he buys along the way Harold slowly makes his way across the country. Along the way Harold will initially be critical of himself as he sees himself alone in the world thanks to uncertainty that he had all throughout his life from a young boy, a father to David and then with a wife he no longer communicates with. It's only when he begins going out of his comfort zone by talking to others along the way that he soon discovers the sad and beautiful truth that he is not alone and there are many people just like him that are struggling to put one foot infront of the other.But for all the profound sorrow Harold encounters this is not a sad read. Rather it suggest that new beginnings can always be found and it is never to late to do something extroidinary. British playwright Rachel Joyces first novel is an endearing debut full of emotion. I found myself riding all the emotions with Harold and was willing him on all the way. At the heart of this is a story of a simple man, a threadbare marriage and a fractured country. All of this makes for an unforgettable and thoughtful story. Do yourself a favour and take a walk with Harold a simple man who will get into your heart and leave you with a smile from ear to ear."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "I fear I am heartless.Some people I respect as readers give this book five stars and I just can't.Basically, it is about a man taking a walk.

Please unite for this wonderfully heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking tale of loss, sorrow and redemption.*REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS*For reasons unimaginable, some (ahem!) fair-minded readers have offered this cleverly-crafted book an oh-so-generous one star, out of five! Seriously, WTF?It may be true that TUPOHF is more likely to be better-received by mature readers and would also appeal to Anglophiles who are the wrong side of forty (effectively old gits, similar to myself), but come on! Unworldly Englishman, Harold Fry, a retired brewery salesman pops out to post a sympathy letter to an old work colleague (Queenie), who resides 627 miles away. But instead of doing this, he spontaneously heads off in her faraway direction, wearing clothes that are better-suited for a trip to the local garden centre.In an unconscious attempt to exorcise his own demons, his accidental journey somehow becomes an inspirational, perhaps heroic, pilgrimage.There is something delightfully Quixotic about his unrealistic quest, and readers of this story will find themselves walking with him, in spirit, each painful step of the way. The crudeness of modernity and the grunge of the great outdoors are the antithesis of his usually disciplined existence; the fractiousness of other members of society offers a comedic contrast to Harold's unfailing innocence.Joyce optimistically recognises the kindness of strangers, who are happy to contribute to a good cause; although (because I am English) I would have at least expected a box of KFC bones to have been hurled at his head from a passing car, or for a farmer to have gurgled, \"Get off my land!\"This tenderly-written novel is the best I've read all year: it will cause you to chuckle from time to time, and there's a good chance it will bring a tear to your eye.So, if raw life experiences have left you mature beyond your years, or if you're a wrinkled old coffin-dodger, about to pop your clogs, this might be right up your street!And please abandon whatever it is you're reading.

He's a 65-year-old recent retiree who hasn't seen his son or slept in the same room as his wife in twenty years. Harold has \u201cmade a mess of being a husband, father, and friend. He had even made a mess of being a son. It wasn't simply that he had betrayed Queenie (his co-worker and friend), and that his parents did not want him. It wasn't simply that he had made a mess of everything with his wife and son. It was rather that he had passed through life and left no impression. He meant nothing.\u201dHarold is also a quiet man who possesses no spiritual beliefs who, at the novel's beginning, receives a letter from Queenie Hennessy, a former co-worker. In this letter, Queenie reveals that she is in a hospice in Northern England (at the border of Scotland), and that she is dying of a terminal cancer. She simply wanted to thank him for his years of friendship and bid him farewell.But, preposterous though it may seem, Harold is provoked. Provoked by her letter. Provoked to start the unlikeliest pilgrimage to Queenie Hennessey's hospice on the other side of England. As readers, we don't know why he wants to do it, and we don't understand how he's going to succeed, but nonetheless, he starts walking.And, it turns out, \u201clife was very different when you walked through it.\u201d Harold learns pretty quickly that \u201cyou saw even more than the land when you got out of the car and used your feet.\u201dHe's right. It is through this trek, this unlikely pilgrimage, that we come to know him, to see  him. We come to know his wife, Maureen, back at the house, too.And we, all of the travelers on this journey, take this holy trek, too.This is a true pilgrimage: painful, poignant, and humorous. And the author, Rachel Joyce, punched her fist through my rib cage and pulled my heart out through the shards of bone, and whispered, ever so sweetly, \u201cYou'll suffer on this journey, too.\u201dThrough her writing, I became a follower of Harold's, one of the weirdos who joined him. I wanted him to explain things to me, like, can you fix a marriage, once it's been shattered, and how do you win back the love of a grown child who has turned his face away from yours, and what, after all, is the true meaning of our existence?But Harold doesn't have any more answers than you or I, he can only contribute that \u201cnot knowing was the biggest truth, and you had to stay with that.\u201dAnd Queenie can only contribute that she \u201chad touched life, played with it a little, but it is a slippery bugger, and finally we must close the door, and leave it behind.\u201dOuch, you guys, and DANG IT.I followed Harold to the very end of this story, which is also a beginning, and I sobbed like a baby through every step.This book is a gift, and I received it.We have not even to risk the adventure alone. The heroes of all time have gone before us. The labyrinth is thoroughly known. We have only to follow the thread of the hero's path, and where we had thought to find an abomination, we shall find a God. And where we had thought to slay another, we shall slay ourselves.

At first I wondered how I could possibly get involved in this apparently absurd story. A retired salesman for a brewery receives a letter of goodbye from an old friend, Queenie, who is dying of cancer, and, on the way to the mailbox with a return reply, ends up setting out on a 500 mile walk to visit her. But it was a quick read and full of pleasant surprises and many special moments where the clouds of life\u2019s travails and buried mistakes clear away for sunlit visions of redemption and truth.Part of Harold\u2019s impetus comes from a stranger at a gas station who gives him the idea that faith and positive thinking can cure cancer. The other push is \u201cthat he wasn\u2019t so much walking to Queenie as away from himself.\u201d He has been shut down emotionally for a long time, with no apparent pathway to bring life back to his marriage or relieve his sense of failure over the raising of his son. I liked how his journey begins to get some flow out of the frozen river of his life:In walking, he freed the past that he had spent twenty years seeking to avoid, and now it chattered and played through his head with a wild energy that was his own. He no longer saw distance in terms of miles. He measured it with his remembering.When strangers he encounters on the way open up to him about secrets in their lives, I was bowled away by the perspectives it renders, as illustrated here: He was a chap like himself, with a unique pain; and yet there would be no knowing that if you passed him in the street, or sat opposite him in a caf\u00e9 and didn\u2019t share his teacake. Harold pictured the gentleman on a station platform, smart in his suit, looking no different from anyone else. It must be the same all over England. People were buying milk, or filling their cars with petrol, or even posting letters. And what no one else knew was the appalling weight of the thing they were carrying inside. The inhuman effort it took sometimes to be normal, and a part of things that appeared both easy and everyday. The loneliness of that.There are a lot of hardships on Harold\u2019s journey, which often cast doubt on his new sense of purpose:Harold\u2019s mind grew limpid, and his body melted. Rain began to patter on the roof and against the tarpaulin, but it was a gentle sound, full of patience, like Maureen singing David to sleep when he was little. When the sound stopped he missed it, as of it had become part of what he knew. He felt there was no longer anything substantial between himself and the earth and the sky.Joyce seems effortlessly eloquent in capturing feelings we all have about our insignificance:His footprints, however firm, would be washed away by rain. It was as if he had never been in any of the places he had been, or met the strangers he had met. He looked behind, and already there was no trace, no sign of him anywhere.There is more to the story than Harold\u2019s walk, which would be a spoiler to reveal. A good part of the narrative deals with Maureen\u2019s reaction to Harold\u2019s mission, and there is slow unfolding of the meaning Harold\u2019s relationship to Queenie, an accountant who worked at the brewery twenty years before. I was quite moved by the resolution of the tale. I compare the experience of this read with the revelations of the power of secret grief in Harding\u2019s Tinkers. I also find a nice parallel of outward and inward journeys as portrayed on a grander scale in Matthiessen\u2019s The Snow Leopard. Others have pointed out a similarity in form of Harold\u2019s walk with the running spree of Forrest Gump as an outlet for his inability to digest a tragedy in his life. Despite these similarities, Joyce\u2019s rendering of the sweetness and sadness of Harold\u2019s story stands out for me as brilliant and fresh."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124482-alison", "userReview": "\"Harold could no longer pass a stranger without acknowledging the truth that everyone was the same, and also unique; and that this was the dilemma of being human.\"I just finished this book on New Year's Eve, and I'm so happy I did, because this is a book about new beginnings, even the ones begun in the twilight of our lives.I have to begin by being perfectly honest which is, I feel, not only in keeping with the spirit of this book, but also the way that Harold would have wanted it. I feel like after what he's been through and having proved himself to be more than ordinarily resilient, that Harold can take the truth.For a while this book really irritated me. It wasn't that I found the characters unbelievable--I actually found them all to be very real and human. It wasn't the setting, the writing, or the pacing of the story-telling. It was the actual walking, or, as the title calls it--the pilgrimage.For the longest time I just didn't understand why Harold didn't hitch a ride, take a bus, hop a train or even get on a horse. The walk to me seemed impractible, unfeasible, and completely unrealistic. It seemed like a mere plot gimmick--hey! I'll write a book about a guy who decides to walk.Another image I couldn't get out of my head as much as I wanted to (once I had thought of it it was just THERE--like a gnawing little itch) was that of another walking (running, actually) literary/film character...Forest Gump. I just kept thinking...this story has been told before...we've seen this. He just starts walking and he doesn't stop. People join in along the way. He becomes famous. He runs, and it isn't about the destination, it's about the journey. Been there, seen that.But somewhere toward the end, this author really pulled this story together for me. There is an effective twist, that was the most heartbreaking part of the story for me, that made me realize Harold had been through circumstances that might render a man quite mad...mad enough to start walking and not stop, and all of a sudden his walk became a lot more understandable and a lot more feasible.I also came to better terms with the metaphorical ramifications of Harold's walk and I quit being so dang literal and worrying about Harold sleeping out on the highway with the foxes without bathing, and I started looking more inward to Harold and his tortured soul.Harold's interaction with Queenie, near the end, is one of the most chilling encounters I have read in fiction. But it was so real, and so true, and so meaningful, I fell for the book all at once, right there at its very close.So if someone asked me what I liked about Harold Frye doing all that walking or what I got from reading about Harold and the circumstances that shaped him until he finally was able to throw them all off there on the side of England's highways...I would first say that I think the author meant for us to realize how we all carry our own particular burdens. That is rather obvious in the characters that Harold encounters and how they had their own unique crosses to bear.\"It must be the same all over England. People were buying milk or filling their cars with petrol, or even posting letters. And what no one else knew was the appalling weight of the thing they were carrying inside.\"But I would also say that I was reminded that it's never too late to start over. That we all have to come face to face with our ghosts, and that doesn't happen on our own time. It happens on it's on natural course undetermined by us (much like all aspects of our lives).

Each slow step, each blister, each new person Harold meets reveals something of the truth of his life to him and to us.An unwanted, neglected boy grew up to be an unremarkable man. But for a brief instant, he frolicked at a dance and attracted the loveliest girl, Maureen. They dreamed and planned and married. They made a lovely home with veggie gardens and had one son, David.Harold worked at the brewery for 45 years for an obnoxious bully of a boss (like his father), but Harold learned early to escape notice by fading into the woodwork. Queenie Hennessey worked in finances at the brewery and was an equally unremarkable person. Harold used to drive her to inspect the books of regional pubs. Suddenly, after many years, she was fired and disappeared. . . from the brewery and from his routine. We sense unfinished business.Now, twenty years later, Harold has received a letter from her saying she is in a hospice, dying of inoperable cancer.Harold is disconsolate that he never got to say good-bye. Maureen shrugs, says she\u2019s sorry, but please pass the jam. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the marmalade, Harold. Jam is red. If you look at things before you pick them up, you\u2019ll find it helps.\u201d\nHardly happily-ever-after stuff. This is not a stop-and-smell-the-roses parable about how to overcome cancer with positive thinking or how to find yourself by following a quest. This is a specific story about the peculiar forces that caused this relationship to form and disintegrate.Many of Harold\u2019s reminiscences (and Maureen\u2019s) are shadowy and disturbed. He and Maureen became more and more estranged as David grew up and left home and rejected them. Harold writes Queenie a letter and sets off to post it. \u201cHarold thought of the words he had written to Queenie, and their inadequacy shamed him. . . .The letter rested on the dark mouth of the post box. He couldn\u2019t let it go.\u201dHe continues walking to another post box, gets hungry, and stops for something to eat, explaining to the girl at the garage where he\u2019s stopped that he\u2019s not buying fuel, just walking to post a letter to someone he knew once who has cancer.She tells him it\u2019s everywhere, but: \n\u201cYou have to believe. That\u2019s what I think. It\u2019s not about medicine and all that stuff. You have to believe a person can get better. There is so much in the human mind we don\u2019t understand. But, you see, if you have faith, you can do anything. . . I don\u2019t mean like religious. I mean . . . believing you can make a difference.\u201d \nAbout her aunt, \n\u201cShe said it gave her hope when everything else had gone--.\u201d\nHarold is thunderstruck. Hope! He can give that! He finds a phone, rings the hospice and announces he is walking to see Queenie and they must please tell her to wait for him. \n\u201cBecause I am going to save her, you see. I will keep walking and she must keep living.\u201d\nHe takes off from the bottom SW toe of England to the top NE corner of the border with Scotland (627 miles). He\u2019s an unremarkable man with, at last, a remarkable purpose \u2013 to save a friend. He shares his story with everyone who asks, and they in turn, share their deepest fears \u2013 as passengers on a plane do. Old ladies at tea (who offer encouragement), professional trekkers (who offer walking and camping tips), kindly villagers (who offer food and sometimes a bed). There\u2019s a map at the back of the book that traces the route with place names for those of us unfamiliar with the geography. I loved the descriptions of the landscape, the weather and the towns as well as the beautiful illustrations by Andrew Davidson.P.S. For me, it was particularly interesting reading this because I had just read Us, the story of a man trekking across Europe after his son, which had the same impulsiveness (and blisters) and a difficult relationship between father, mother and son.And immediately before this, I read Tim Winton\u2019s early book of short stories, Scission, which includes \u201cWilderness\u201d, the story of a couple whose only real connection with each other is accumulating exactly the right hiking and camping equipment and doing treks together.

He would also have easily been voted \u2018least likely to go on a spiritual quest\u2019. This makes him perfect for this story because it\u2019s about unlikely thoughts, friendships, marriages, what have you. Harold\u2019s quest begins with a letter from a former co-worker he thinks of fondly. They\u2019ve shared a pivotal moment in Harold\u2019s life. He reads the letter soon after he retires from said job and he reads it in front of his continually carping wife, Maureen. Harold doesn\u2019t even mean to go on a quest. He scribbles some benign well wishes on a card to his dying co-worker and sets out to mail it and somewhere along that mini quest his journey becomes epic as he decides to walk to her hospice with a vague belief that she\u2019ll HAVE to wait to die until he gets to her. His steps will heal her. He meets many kind, odd, and not so kind people along the way. Mostly he gets caught in his head and in his not so perfect past. He sometimes spins in circles, he has moments of clarity, epiphanies. Usually he just tries to put one foot in front of the other. Even this is a challenge when he realizes he\u2019s going the wrong direction or in loops. There is a place in the book where I was afraid things were going to go down an ordinary path. I felt let down. Then Joyce showed the reason she teased us with that route. I loved the humor in \u201cThe Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\u201d.

We dissected life as it happened for him until his 63rd birthday, and we found closure on many heartbreak and sorrows.

Are you saying you're going to quit reading?ME: Whoah! Let's not jump to any conclusions, the whole goal of this discussion is just to figure out where we stand, and where we're headed, and if we want to go there and how much we're prepared to invest in terms of time and cognitive load...TUPOHF: Look, there are important revelations ahead for our main character Harold Fry, he's going to meet all these ordinary people who are just shock-full of life-changing, earth-moving wisdom...ME: Harold Fry. Let's start with him. I'm finding the character a little wooden, if you'll forgive the expression, but isn't the retiree who always avoided the limelight and just did his best to do his duty while resisting escapist urges a little overdone? Really, there are no Harold Frys in the real world, he's just a straw-man waiting to be blown over.TUPOHF: Yes, of course, and so much will be revealed later, because the woman dying of cancer who wrote to let him know did something for him years ago, something extremely helpful.ME: You've mentionned that. And, having mentionned it, there was no reason to withhold what it was she did for Harold. So what is it?TUPOHF: Can't say. It's a huge surprise.ME: This is blackmail.TUPOHF: Lots of other people would be glad to read me.ME: Maybe so, but I have a lot of books I need to get to, it's not that I'm not enjoying the read, and really I'm quite interested in characters who deviate from the regular course of things to seize meaning for their existence and also characters who are on the verge of dying because only when there's no time left do the important things become so clearly sallient. But the course appears predetermined. It feels a little preachy, to be perfectly honest.TUPOHF: I can only recommend you continue the read.

Mostly poor, hardworking female characters who take the time to articulate to a perfect stranger these golden nuggets of folk wisdom, like chicken mcnuggets of the soul.

Harold Fry\u2026 you made me cry and cry and cry and then when I thought I was finished crying\u2026you made me cry again.Harold Fry, now retired, receives a letter from an old friend and work colleague, Queenie Hennessy. Queenie, who hasn\u2019t seen Harold for over twenty years, is saying goodbye. So begins Harold\u2019s journey. A journey which will reconcile Harold with his future and a journey which will bring him back to his past. This book examines so many themes; life, relationships, marriage, loss, love, characters, regrets, friendships, those small acts of kindness that are significant from both strangers and friends, the courage and fears we all experience in our everyday lives and the difficulties that can arise when we are unable to or don\u2019t know how to express our thoughts and feelings.This debut novel by Rachel Joyce is quite simply superb and wonderful in every respect. There is nothing I can find fault with. From the wonderful array of interesting characters in the book, the simple yet beautiful prose, the perfect pacing of the story, the delicate and vivid imagery, to the absolute thought provoking, sentimental, poignant and emotional feelings that the story aroused throughout. This is a story which will pull at your heart strings many times, in so many ways. It is a story that will remain with you long after you have finished reading it.

It even had some Forrest Gump-ian characteristics (without the Southern accent or the meteoric run through historical events). But despite some similarities, this was a unique book with a story all its own.Harold Fry recently retired from his job, and now doesn't feel motivated to do much of anything. His very presence seems to irritate his wife, Maureen. But then again, their relationship has been strained for some time, full of hurt and anger both spoken and unspoken, especially since their son, David, left home.One day, Harold receives a letter from an unlikely source\u2014Queenie Hennessy, a former coworker he hasn't seen or heard from in 20 years. Queenie wrote to tell Harold that she is in hospice suffering from terminal cancer, and wanted to say goodbye. Harold is shocked by this news and touched by the memories Queenie's letter stirred up, so he quickly dashes off a note of support, and heads to the corner mailbox. Yet as he arrives at the mailbox, he realizes it is a nice day outside, and decides to keep walking to the next one.On his journey to the post office, from where he figures sending the letter will allow it to arrive quicker, Harold has a chance encounter that changes everything. And then he decides he must keep walking, all the way to visit Queenie in person to help save her\u2014despite the fact it is a 600-mile journey from his home in Kingsbridge to the hospice in Berwick-on-Tweed. Not to mention he hasn't had much physical exercise in many years, and isn't all dressed for that type of journey.But walk he does, much to his surprise, and Maureen's shock, anger, and chagrin. Harold's walk opens his mind to memories both good and painful, as he relives his friendship with Queenie and tries to figure out exactly where his and Maureen's relationship went wrong. \"Life was very different when you walked through it,\" he said, and along his walk he comes into contact with many different people and realizes that each has an interesting story to tell.\"The world was made up of people putting one foot in front of the other; and a life might appear ordinary simply because the person living it had been doing so for a long time.\" Harold's journey takes many interesting twists and turns, and people's reactions to it become almost indicative of the world we live in today. And during Harold's absence, Maureen tries to figure out the root of her anger with Harold, and whether her life is worth living without him.This is a compelling, enjoyable, and warm story about the unlikely journeys we take, sometimes simply to prove we still have life inside of us. It's also a story about the things we say and don't say to those we care about, and the ramifications of both. I liked this book quite a bit, although I could have done without the events around the public's embracing of Harold's pilgrimage, as I felt it took the book into more satirical territory than the story needed.

The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is one of those books for me. Harold Fry is an ordinary older man who has recently retired from his lifelong rather ordinary job. He spends his days in a regimented, very structured kind of way with his wife of many years, Maureen. It was on one of those ordinary days that harold received a letter from an old co-worker and friend,Queenie Hennessy, telling him that she has terminal cancer and wishing to say goodbye. Harold, being an unemotional and non-demonstrative sort of man, felt very uncomfortable with Queenie's letter; however, he wrote back replying that he was sorry and wished her well. He set out that morning to mail the letter.... and what he was about to discover was that his entire world was about to change. Along the way, Harold engaged in conversation with a young woman about how important it is to have faith.. to believe, really believe in something. It was in that moment that Harold seemed to awaken from what seemed a deep sleep.. he became aware of an inner voice telling him that his letter to Queenie needed to be delivered in person. Although he was far from being an impulsive man, in that instant Harold decided to embark on the 600+ miles to the hospice where Queenie was being cared for. Harold believed... he had faith that as long as he continued to walk toward Queenie, she would not die. On the surface, Harold's idea may seem crazy but it began to make a lot of sense. Harold and Queenie were embodiments of the idea that belief in something , combined with sheer will can actually make things happen. And so Harold's journey began....Although Harold started out as a sort of fearful, underachieving ,ordinary man.. full of regrets about things he had not done and things he should have said but had not... his journey transformed him seemingly into the man he was meant to be. although his journey was long and arduous and several times he nearly lost hope he would ever reach his destination, he reached deep down inside himself and found the courage to continue.. and the hope that continued to carry him forward.. one foot after the other.Reading Harold's story reminded me of a quote by Mark Twain... \"Courage is not the absence of fear. It is acting in spite of it.\" I don't think I would be spoiling this wonderful story by revealing that Harold did indeed reach his destination and although he spent just a few moments with Queenie, his life was forever changed by the journey he had undertaken. Yes, Harold still had regrets but he learned something.. to be gentle with himself.. to forgive himself for not being perfect.. and to let go of all of the things from his life which held him back and kept him from becoming the man he was destined to be.Ms. Joyce has written a beautiful and inspiring story. I simply could not put this book down! As I read, I found myself drawn into Harold's story.. feeling his regrets and determination... even commiserating with him over the blisters on his feet and his painful leg cramps. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Harold is a character that will make you laugh and cry.. and most importantly, he will inspire you to take a look at your own life.

It seemed as the book progressed that Harold slowly began to realize, or to admit to himself, why he had to walk. His past began to open up to him and, in parallel, at home, his wife began to have much the same experience.This is not a novel of big moments. It is one of small moments---the remembered grasp of a son's hand, a dog dropping a stone at his feet, a neighbor with a map, the last look at his mother leaving. All these thoughts running through Harold's head as if he is finally free to experience the full span of his life and how he has become so paralyzed in recent years. As he mused: \"Life was very different when you walked through it.\"(p 40)And \"It surprised him that he was remembering all this. Maybe it was the walking. Maybe you saw even more than the land when you got out of the car and used your feet..\"(p 43)Certainly Harold did see more, much of it internal. Yes, he did notice the beauty of the sky and the flowers on those days it wasn't pouring rain, but he also saw deep into himself and his past and the life he'd led. This walk with a purpose freed him to rethink his life. And to think about Life. \"Harold pictured the gentleman on a station platform, smart in his suit, looking no different from anyone else. It must be the same all over England. People were buying  milk, or filling their cars with petrol, or even posting letters. And what no one else knew was the appalling  weight of the thing they were carrying inside. The inhuman effort it took sometimes to be normal and a part of things that appeared both easy and everyday.

It was almost as if he had died and was now reviewing everything about his life, his failures, his successes, the psychology of what made him what he had become with an angel or spiritual guide and now perhaps can find ways to finally resolve and improve what life he has left in him. Here are my random thoughts and reasons I really loved the book.1. This book couldn't have been written by a youngster, say someone in their forties. The author has experienced these emotions and life's lessons first hand and does what is hard to do: Explain complicated relationships and human behavior. She's a pro and brings each of these behavior and emotions to the deepest part of the gut and then to the surface.2. In the beginning, I thought the whole idea of the pilgrimage seemed too theoretical and unrealistic. However it turns out to be a brilliant and extremely effective way to accomplish the goal of the author to verbalize feelings about life and death and relationships with others. But it's not just a metaphor. It becomes real and believable. 3. Having become somewhat of a recluse and uninvolved person, Harold's journey forces him to learn how to communicate with others and accept other's care and generosity. As he does this, he learns and becomes a better man. One of the messages is how important it is to allow others to be a part of your life, even people you may not like at first. There were many people who gave Harold what he needed when he needed it primarily because he became so humble and and vulnerable.4. For various reasons I won't list, Harold's marriage had become nothing. The book does a solid job of describing the anatomy of a marriage gone bad. And yet, at the core, there were reasons it could still work if only serious issues from the past could be resolved. Harold's journey is also a parallel journey with his wife's journey and I found it to be quite touching and realistic. It is touching, gritty and a fast and extemely good read."}], "description": "Recently retired, sweet, emotionally numb Harold Fry is jolted out of his passivity by a letter from Queenie Hennessy, an old friend, who he hasn't heard from in twenty years. She has written to say she is in hospice and wanted to say goodbye. Leaving his tense, bitter wife Maureen to her chores, Harold intends a quick walk to the corner mailbox to post his reply but instead, inspired by a chance encounter, he becomes convinced he must deliver his message in person to Queenie--who is 600 miles away--because as long as he keeps walking, Harold believes that Queenie will not die. So without hiking boots, rain gear, map or cell phone, one of the most endearing characters in current fiction begins his unlikely pilgrimage across the English countryside. Along the way, strangers stir up memories--flashbacks, often painful, from when his marriage was filled with promise and then not, of his inadequacy as a father, and of his shortcomings as a husband. Ironically, his wife Maureen, shocked by her husband's sudden absence, begins to long for his presence. Is it possible for Harold and Maureen to bridge the distance between them?
