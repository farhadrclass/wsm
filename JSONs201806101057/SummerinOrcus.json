Kingfisher binge-read this week. Both a portal fantasy and a commentary on same. Summer, an eleven-year-old girl, escapes her overprotective and somewhat mentally ill mother through the ambiguous help of Baba Yaga, to a peculiar quest in a fantasy world that allows her to both discover and learn her strengths. (I just typo'd that, \"earn her strengths\". That, too.)Somewhere, I made the observation that the ur-theme of books for the young, or at least for adolescents, is empowerment, but the ur-theme for grownups is redemption. This book manages to be a curious compound of both, which I am going to have to think about for a bit.Also, if you didn't get enough Freddy in Georgette Heyer's Cotillion (and one can never have enough Freddy), Reginald the helpful hoopoe is the perfect Freddy.

But I will be a great deal older before that day comes, I think.\u201d\n Not quite a beginning quote but it may be why so many rightly say this is a middle-school portal fantasy for adults, though it is equally an adult portal fantasy for those middle-schoolers comfortable in classic adult fantasy (I know you're out there, lurking on GR: I was once you).T.Kingfisher (Ursula Vernon) is a rare author. She conceives utterly strange and sometimes wondrous and heartfully true things then conveys them in commonsense prose. That is no small feat: she writes very close-to-the-bone indeed and says more in occasional sparsity than does many a more florid writer. One gets the sense of listening to a friend telling a very good tale around a fading campfire.Summer is the protagonist of the tale who ends up in the land of Orcus, the land of word games made real and people of all types, mostly not human types. Whether laughably loony word games or deadly serious, everyday adult-type word games of potential treachery and destruction, there is much to delight the word-lover in this little book and even more to delight the lover of 'hanging-in-there,' and of 'doing the right thing even when the outcome isn't quite exactly what you thought it would be because dammit it's the Right Thing.'\n\"It is difficult to walk across an enchanted desert and then be thrust into someone else\u2019s sense of humor.\"\n :)Edited to add: you can read this for free on her website at:Summer In Orcusor buy for a modest sum on Kindle."}, {"userName": "Rachel (Kalanadi)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17810287-rachel-kalanadi", "userReview": "3.5 stars.

I enjoyed it right from the start, but by the end it had carved itself a permanent place in my heart. For starters, I love portal fantasies that really engage with the personal consequences of visiting a different world, and Summer in Orcus does that beautifully, exploring Summer\u2019s changing self-perception and asking what will be different for her once she returns home. I love that Summer\u2019s genre-savviness \u2013 born of a life where reading is her only escape from her mother\u2019s extreme overprotectiveness \u2013 informs the way she deals with the situations she encounters, and I love that her strength and power comes from unexpected places. I loved the richness, strangeness and detail of Orcus and the characters Summer encountered there. I loved the emphasis on the importance of small quests \u2013 fixing something, even if you can\u2019t fix everything. Plus it was funny and smart and heartwarming and sad and beautiful. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1288287-kara", "userReview": "Due to the just-two-chapters-a-week release schedule of this book that I stumbled on just as Chapter One was posted (Arghhh! That it is NOT how I read! I do not eat my stories in dainty little bites! I gorge myself on books whole!) I had plenty of time to work on the review, and it quickly morphed into a recap with annotations. So bear with me, or skip, if you fear elongated spoilers.This story is a homage to the subgenre of \"portal fantasy\" \u2013 a young person who travels through a magical portal from our world to a magical world.Summer in Orcus starts off grounded solidly in reality as the main character, an eleven year old girl named Summer, struggles to deal with living with a mother who NEEDS HELP. Unfortunately, her mother is using the (sadly common) coping mechanism of treating her young daughter like a therapist, constantly unloading all of her problems on her, demanding a constant reassurance of love, and not letting her daughter take two steps without freaking out about danger everywhere.Kingfisher's opening drags a bright highlighter over why being a kid can really suck, made worse by knowing stories like this play out every day, and Summer is an all too common modern character of a child struggling to grow up in a dysfunctional environment, seen in many modern fiction books today.However, the story takes a sharp left turn into another genre entirely as Baba Yaga's chicken legged house strolls into Summer's backyard one evening. Summer dares enter Baba Yaga's domain, and Baba Yaga, being in a good (and slightly capricious) mood, offers Summer her \"heart's desire\" (and a talking weasel, as a bonus). Summer isn't sure, exactly, what she wants the most, and Baba Yaga is a little too cheerful telling her that finding that out is part of the fun.Baba Yaga then kicks her out and Summer is no longer in her backyard but some magical new place. Being a well-read child, she immediately gets it that she's in a Narnia-like situation, and just rolls with it, and the story rapidly becomes the kind of meta that results from a literate 21st century child tumbling into a fantasy book archetype.The first people she meets is the classic trio of three older women with magic and advice, living on the fringe of civilization. These three have taken the names Donkeyskin, Boarskin and Bearskin after their respective magic cloaks. They lead Summer through their forest, filled with magic trees with leaves that change shape when they fall, becoming things like mice or lizards when they touch the ground. But the Frog-Tree is dying, and it breaks Summer's heart to watch this particular tree unable to use its own magic properly. The trio tell Summer something is causing magical things to die, and then send her on her way, advising her to go to the \u201cWaystation\u201d which will help her figure out her next move. She spends a night crossing a desert littered with \u201csand stars\u201d - scorpions that glow in the dark (a scary / gorgeous piece of imagery) - and almost gets high on the dizzying mirrored sight of the star covered sky and star covered ground, a magnificent vista right out of something like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.On the other side Summer discovers the Wheystation and is not impressed with the cheese puns she encounters.We meet the wheymaster, who could have stepped out of either the Land of Expectations or Diagon Alley, and we first hear about Zultan and the Queen-in-Chains. (Hah! What a title! Take that, Child-Like-Empress!) Then Zultan and his henchman Grub and his minions show up, hunting for a human girl they hear has stumbled into Orcus, and she has to hide in a room-sized block of cheese while the wheymaster throws them off the trail. The wheymaster then gives Summer some advice on what direction to follow, using a type of prophetic cheese.Kingfisher is clearly a major cheese lover, and while I\u2019m rather sparing in my own cheese consumption, even I was impressed with her fantasy take on cheeses, including cheese made from the milk of nightmares, cheese aged in moonlight, cheese made with the honey of clockwork bees, and more. All these fantastic cheeses come in every imaginable (and some not so imaginable) shape, size, color, and texture. It\u2019s so imaginative that, despite rolling my eyes along with Summer when the scene started, I was sad when Summer had to move on from this cheese-version of Honeydukes.Sent on her way with a cheese-sword (like a cheese knife, only bigger, you know, to deal with really big cheeses :-D) she walks through a world that is described as gorgeous as a trip to any national park, breathtaking even before the magical elements are added in. But Zultan and his pack are hot on her heels. As she and the weasel run and hide, she grimly hangs on to the mantra that if the Pevensie kids could hack it, so can she. Along the road Summer meets a hoopoe bird named Reginald \u2013 who delightfully talks just like Bertie Wooster \u2013 and he cheerfully offers to help her out, much to the weasel's disgust, sneering to Summer about the bird's foppish manners. But Summer is delighted by Reginald's friendliness and his flock of valet-birds that follow him around to make sure he dresses properly for dinner and such, and I was equally charmed by this avian Jeeves and Wooster.The next day Summer realizes camping makes for a miserable morning, even in an enchanted land. Kingfisher, in a hilarious mini narrative rant, goes on about how there is absolutely nothing poetic about dew, it's just cold water that gets everywhere, and she has clearly been on a few primitive camping trips herself after reading too much Byron. Summer, cold and damp, braves on, and stumbles on another pun in the form of a \"were-house\" \u2013fearsome wolf by day, cozy cottage by night \u2013currently trapped by house-hunters.Kingfisher balances out her howlingly bad puns by having Summer groan each time she comes across one. But the \"were-house\" turns out to be more than just a pun. Kingfisher takes the idea of Baba Yaga's walking house and teases that idea out \u2013 what if it were one of a species? Wild houses, tame houses, herds of houses on migration; it's so stupid its brilliant, and what a wonderful adult fantasy that you could walk out one day and wrangle a house, rather than deal with mortgages and real estate agents. Yes please! Summer agrees to free him because she had a moment of almost acting just like her mother, and the thought of her mother having already programmed her that deeply pushes her straight into acting brave, and the were-house joins the group.Then Summer sees her pursuers up close, all riding \u201cSleipnirians\u201d, which Kingfisher borrows from Celtic mythology and makes weirder with not just eight legs, but also eight eyes and an all over sickening distortion by the mind-bending blurring of horse and spider. Reginald tries to throw them off while Summer hides. Watching Grub suspiciously question Reginald, Summer is willing to admit she is scared, but knows the right thing to do is turn herself in before her new friend gets killed on her behalf. Before she has to find out if she can follow through on this, there is a brief scuffle that leaves one of the valet-birds dead and the hunters ride on. Safe momentarily, but the stakes have been raised. And then the stakes get raised again as they find more background characters have been killed by Zultan\u2019s men. Summer is horrified that people died because of her, and the wolf has to firmly tell her that she didn\u2019t do anything, nor should she take on other people\u2019s guilt.Summer wants to take action, and decides to somehow help the sick Frog-Tree. Reginald advises seeking out a forester he knows of, so the group head towards a nearby town on the way to the forester. As they continue on, they all give Summer more details about Orcus, and it is a major relief to have a change in tone after a scene with a bunch of dead extras, and it\u2019s fascinating world-building. As much as this follows the pattern of lands like Narnia, Oz and Fantastica, it is an original and creative version of a fantasy land, and we see more of that creativity as Summer enters Fen-town and we get all the delights of a fantasy market town, like Milo arriving in Dictionopolis.There is also layer of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around the magical elements, as we learn the creatures of Orcus are just as burdened by special permits and proper licenses as we are in this world. In fact, Summer bluffs her way through Customs based on a recent trip with her mother to the DMV, much to her little gang\u2019s delight.Next Summer and her group meet the Forester, a woman who used to be a dragon, but her body was stolen from her by a girl who wished to be a dragon, resulting in a body switch, and now the Forester is stuck in the body of a human with the heart of a dragon. It\u2019s even worse than it sounds.She offers Summer guidance both in immediate and general terms; her own knowledge of what can be changed and what must be accepted was hard won, making her advice all the more valuable. She also knows that the Queen-in-Chains is sending out wasps that are causing magical things to die, so they have to find a wasp to follow back to the queen.But first they stop at Reginald\u2019s family home for advice and supplies from dear pater. And, oh my, his father's manor is the bird version of Totleigh Towers that I never knew I needed but am now completely in love with! Reginald\u2019s father gives Summer some more information about Zultan and more backstory, and Kingfisher just about breaks my heart with the tragedy of the dogs of Orcus.There\u2019s a detour from the action as Summer is invited to attend a ball, showing more of the mor\u00e8s of Orcus\u2019s aviary culture. But the party is ruined by another attack from Zultan, almost managing to burn down the family manor, and Summer now has two badass geese guards, assigned by Reginald\u2019s father to protect the little group.They travel to the Great Pipes, a mountain-sized cactus, with the inside hollowed out to hold an entire city! Here Summer meets the Priestess of the Pipes, who reminds her strongly of her teacher \u2013 but the resemblance only goes so far, and Summer experiences her first true betrayal, and Kingfisher writes exquisitely of how mental pain can be astonishingly like physical pain as Summer tries to grasp how in the space of just a few moments everything goes horribly wrong.And quickly goes from horribly wrong to horribly weird as Summer learns more than she wants about Zultan, the kind of villain who likes to have a civilized conversation with the hero over tea and explain earnestly that they are not truly wicked, and, indeed, there is no good or evil, only power, and all the usual excuses. He is a quietly insane bookworm who immolates people because he \u201cgot in the habit.\u201d Scary!Then Summer meets another high ranking minion, an antelope-woman, who is cheerfully chaotic in a way that would make your average trickster god sit up and take notice. She delights in telling Summer a creation myth about Orcus and why her own people are mistrusted, while also describing all the terrible things she might do to Summer, clearly enjoying the chance to mar a piece of Summer\u2019s innocence the same way someone else would delight in carving their initials into a new jar of peanut butter.Still, she offers escape, and Summer takes it, learning the awful fact that sometimes all possible choices in a given situation are bad. An escape follows that involves more trudging than chases, and Summer is reunited with her little group, who all immediately run off the antelope-woman with threats and curses and shower Summer in love and reassurance, leaving her felling guilty and confused, but also loved for once, instead of smothered.And, even better, her group caught one of the magic-killing wasps, so they are off find the queen!But the house-hunters again try to snatch the were-house, but Summer manages to fight back - not with fire and sword - but with the iciest grown-up words she can hurl at them, (words like \u2018registered\u2019, \u2018permit\u2019, \u2018authorities\u2019, etc.), and gets them to back off. It\u2019s a lesson everyone could stand to learn young \u2013 act like you have the strongest legal position and you\u2019ll probably get away with it.But there\u2019s no talking their way out of things as Zultan, Grub and the henchmen attack, and there is time only for the briefest of strategic assessments for where\u2019s a good place to take a stand, and Kingfisher manages to capture the frantic confusion of a fight scene dead on while still making it possible to follow the action.When Summer sees Grub down, she takes all her anger and fear and shoves it into him via the cheese sword, not ashamed to attack someone while he is down, because he is a homicidal maniac. That briefly makes things worse, as his inner demon is literally let loose, but she takes that on pretty well too, and soon only Zultan is left, morosely looking at the carnage as if it has nothing to do with him, and takes off.They won the battle, but it cost them dearly, and they have to choose between following Zultan, continuing to seek out the Queen-in-Chains, or just giving up, and as much as Summer wants to give up, the urge to see it through, and to make sure the death of those who just died has meaning, is stronger and they soon find the Queen-in-Chains\u2019 palace.The queen lives in a cathedral-sized wasp nest, and I bet this is Kingfisher-the-gardener writing rather than Kingfisher-the-author. Oh sure, bees and their hives are all well and good, but a wasp nest can get ugly real fast. And we meet the Queen-in-Chains. She\u2019s a dragon. In fact, she\u2019s the human who stole the dragon body from the Forester, and it has driven her nearly insane. Summer realizes the dragon needs someone to talk to, so she resumes the old role she played with her mother of making soothing noises and reassurances while coaxing the whole story from her. It\u2019s a great deviation from the usual narrative to have the protagonist sit down and talk to the Big Bad Monster and ask what\u2019s wrong rather than attacking.It turns out she has no control over her dragon body, and she begged to be chained to stop mindlessly ravaging, but Zultan used her before chaining her, and she is terrified he will unleash her horrific destruction again. In the end, all she needs is a reassurance that everything-is-going-to-be-OK, a line Summer is well rehearsed in saying.But leaving the queen\u2019s nest-castle Summer walks smack into Zultan, and they have an old fashioned villain/hero standoff, with Summer being reasonable and angry and Zultan being insane and hyper-civilized. She survives, with the help of her friends, and, thankfully, Zultan does not, and they turn back to somberly retrace their steps homeward. Back at the beginning, the Frog Tree dies, but Summer is able to plant a seed that springs immediately to life to a Frog-Sapling, and she finally feels ready to go home. Baba Yaga congratulates her at the portal and Summer angrily demands that she be allowed to remember what happened in a scene that happily tips most fantasy ending troupes on their head. Summer returns home, not happy \u2013 but not sad either \u2013 to know someday she will have to leave her home permanently, despite her mother\u2019s fears.Summer is an up-to-date example of the typical portal-fantasy main character, markedly contrasted from her 19th and 20th century predecessors.Summer doesn't stride with the confidence born of being part of the top portion of the mighty British Empire like Alice and Wendy, and she isn't eager to do something after being told to stay out of the way and let the grownups handle things, like the Pevensie kids. But neither is she bored with American post-WWII affluence, like Milo. And Summer has issues, but she's fully aware of them, and isn't avoiding them, like Bastian. (Note: I am purposefully not including Dorothy because she did not choose to walk through her portal, but was instead forcibly dragged by that tornado.)But what is most revealing about her character takes place early on, when Summer is told to choose a candle:There was a little round table in the middle of the room, and on it stood a dozen candles. They were all colors and sizes. A few of them had been melted partway down. Several were shaped like animals. Summer\u2019s hand hovered over a silver unicorn, with the wick coming out of its horn, but then settled on a plain beeswax frog. The wick had been burned down a little way already and beads of honey-colored wax ran down its sides.Summer chooses the frog, and is complimented on her choice. Unicorns versus frogs. Let's unpack that, shall we? >cracks knuckles<A unicorn is a nonexistent creature, a wish for impossible things. At best, a unicorn represents the human desire to try to go beyond what we think is possible \u2013 to push all boundaries and achieve greatness. The unicorn makes a wonderful mascot for the Boston Marathon, as humans each year attempt to break records of what the human body can do in terms of strength and speed, just by putting one foot in front of the other.At worst, the unicorn represents things that simply cannot exist, and make us depressed by the fact we can\u2019t have them. A unicorn is that Manic Pixie Dream Girl, a ridiculous standard of physically impossible waist measurements and mentally unhealthy mindsets. A \u201cunicorn\u201d is often also used in business terms to describe a perfect company. Many real life companies, especially in Silicon Valley, have been called \"unicorns\" - except most turn out to be just ordinary nags that cannot magically give every stockholder a billion dollars. Meanwhile, a frog is a deceptively ordinary beast, full of disregarded potential.Frogs are common props for female practitioners of the magical arts, from Shakespeare's three witches cooking up spells to J.K. Rowling's young Lily coming home from Hogwarts with teacups full of frogs, much to her sister's jealously. A frog tells Sleeping Beauty's mom she is with child, frogs are known to become princes in other fairy tales, and Queen Elizabeth I nicknamed one of her (many) suitors Monsieur Frog, as a playful suggestion that his love for her might be real \u2013 because a frog's love is considered to be noticeably more constant than a fickle unicorn's affection.In nature, frogs can be a source of food, or used as a weapon, depending on the type, they are the go-to example in the schoolroom for how cycles of nature work, and their ability to lie dormant as eggs throughout droughts are practically miraculous. They are an ordinary, common miracle, and hence overlooked.Frogs are a symbol of birth, transitions, sexuality and fertility. They show that someone can turn from one thing to become a completely new thing in a very real way.Unicorns might die (or at least throw a hissy fit) if their mane gets mused, but frogs will dig into the mud and survive, willing to do what it takes to live and thrive, even if that means not looking pretty.Summer chooses the frog because she would rather have real, solid change in her life than a false veneer of magical transformation that is all style and no substance. Summer desperately wants to be an adult with all the agency that comes with it rather than be a little girl playing tea time with her dolls who has little say in all decisions in her life from bedtime to living arrangements. Summer doesn't want a holiday from real life. Quite simply, she wants to grow up."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4254027-denise", "userReview": "Great beginnings and decent end, just wish the middle had been reduced."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "Summer in Orcus is just lovely; a portal fantasy with something of the whimsy and warmth of Valente\u2019s Fairyland, and likely to appeal to a similar audience. Some of the characters could\u2019ve come straight from Fairyland, in the best possible way: Reginald the society hoopoe, with his Regency slang; Glorious the were-house, who is a wolf during the day and a house by night; Boarskin, Deerskin and Bearskin, who warn Summer of the cancer at the heart of the world; even the Frog Tree and its dryad.That isn\u2019t to say it feels derivative, because it doesn\u2019t: it feels very much like itself. But it has something of the same whimsy and imagination, and I enjoyed it heartily. There is something a little darker than Fairyland, I think; perhaps from the very fact that the quest is initiated by the capricious and sometimes cruel Baba Yaga.It\u2019s a fairly typical quest story, in a way, except that the great confrontation at the end turns out to be uniquely suited to Summer\u2019s talents and experience. There\u2019s a fair dose of bittersweetness, heroism aplenty \u2014 and, to my relief, a hope that Summer will see her friends again someday.Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."}, {"userName": "Maija", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95855-maija", "userReview": "So far my least favourite T. Kingfisher book. The reason why this book didn't work for me is just a big personal preference thing, so keep that in mind.Summer in Orcus is a portal fantasy book that reads a lot younger than T. Kingfisher's other books. During the first half I was wondering why she didn't publish this as Ursula Vernon, T. Kingfisher being the name she uses for adult fiction. With time I did realize that the 11-year-old protagonist would probably have been more hopeful and action-ready in a children's book, whereas here she often feels tired, hopeless, cold, and scared. My main beef with the book is that this fantasy world is, to put it in Seanan McGuire's Every Heart A Doorway terms, a High Nonsense world. And I don't get along that well with those (see Alice in Wonderland). There is a hodgepodge of random stuff like werehouses, frog trees, Regency birds, etc etc. So, let's say it's whimsical. Vernon herself says in the afterword that Orcus is a story where she could put all those random tidbits and ideas that had come to her mind but hadn't fit into any of her other stories. So the protagonist and her party spend their time going to a new place, experiencing a random quirky thing/place/character, and moving onwards to the next thing. That has never been my cup of tea, even if there is a bigger plot on the background.This was first published as a web serial on Vernon's website, and I found that even with the ebook, I felt better reading it in parts, one or two chapters at a time.

I\u2019ve loved them for as long as I can remember, from Narnia to Oz to Wonderland to Amber and even for a brief moment Xanth, I have loved stories of someone from this mundane world transported to a world full of magic and wonder. Summer in Orcus is an offering in this category from T. Kingfisher, aka Ursula Vernon, and it is marvelous. The best I can describe it is a middlegrade fantasy for adults, and much like Catherynne Valente\u2019s The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making (which is a similarly a middlegrade fantasy for adults), it makes for wonderful reading. I don\u2019t know how it will be received by children or pre-adolescents, but this adult loved every moment spent reading it.Summer is the daughter of an anxiety-ridden mother, and so spends most of her time at home being warned about the various potential dangers of mundane household items. In addition, when she isn\u2019t being warned away from splashing in puddles (you could get sick from the germs, and you don\u2019t know how deep that puddle goes) she listens to and comforts her mother and thus Summer is a very grown-up eleven year old. Which is why, when Baba Yaga comes to offer Summer her heart\u2019s desire, she takes a very grown-up moment to think about it. Then, without really knowing what that heart\u2019s desire is, Baba Yaga sends her off to Orcus with a talking weasel to find her own way. It\u2019s utterly glorious. Kingfisher has a deep practical nature that she melds with her wild flights of fantasy to create a world where events follow logically, but also contains a talking hoopoe in a waistcoat and a were-house (a wolf who turns into a cottage at night).I loved this; I loved every single second of it."}, {"userName": "Brigid Keely", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376296-brigid-keely", "userReview": "T.

So you may call this a bias review but this is really good.The story started out with Summer detailing her home life. How her mother was and how she felt trap by it all. Then she spied a house with chicken legs moving in next door. That lead her to the adventure, to her heart desire. Ms. Vernon has written another wonderful story, steep in world building and strange characters. Many that will stay with you long after you finish reading.

Charming, delightful, with a dark bite to it, this is a portal fantasy done wonderfully. Summer meets birds, a were-house, a dragon, and a deeply creepy bad guy.

Kingfisher (aka Ursula Vernon). Any story that starts with seeing a house walk down your alley on bird legs, and doesn't end with a huge battle or the heroine falling in love with someone works quite well for me. Summer in Orcus sounds like a season spent somewhere else. It's not. Summer is the heroine's name. She's a fine character. She doesn't have all the answers for what needs to be done, but she's determined and plucky. I gave it four stars because the story has a slightly unfinished feel to me. Lots of lovely ideas, like the trees whose dropped leaves become ... something else. And the little valet-birds in bowler hats, and a wolf, a weasel, and a hoopoe for traveling companions. But the end happens a little quickly and seems a little unsatisfying for that quickness, as well as for the final plot resolution. The story was originally serialized online. I read a few episodes there, but finally opted to binge-read the story by purchasing it on Amazon when it was complete. I really get a lot of pleasure out of this author's writing, so I was happy to throw some $$ her way too.

Which sounds self-contradictory, but the realism Vernon is interested in is not of scene or setting but rather of character and, especially, place. In the introduction, she refers to the \u201cterrible, fascinating darkness underneath the fantasy world,\u201d but I think the real crux of the matter is not so much how dark the world is but to what extent it has its own existence independent of its visitors. All fantasy worlds have a potential problem with establishing their realism, of course, but portal fantasy is especially prone to it because there\u2019s an obvious contrast between the real world from which the character comes, and is presumably returning to, and the one in which the story is set. The problem here is that if the author doesn\u2019t think of the portal world as a real place, then the story, and the characters in particular, don\u2019t have to be particularly real either: instead, the characters can end up playing hero or adventurer, acting in ways that the author would immediately recognize were wrong if he or she was writing them in the character\u2019s own world. The classic example is, of course, the Narnia books, in which Narnia serves mainly as a way for Lewis to tell a number of stories which are simply metaphors for Christian doctrine. Since the stories are imposed on Narnia from the outside, hampering the development of its own internal logic, it\u2019s only natural that it should appear to be not entirely real, and so the behavior of the children visiting it should also be unreal, as they are merely playing in an adventure playground designed for them. They are never really scared, because they know that nothing bad can happen; they aren't traumatized by killing, because the enemies they kill are imaginary; etc., etc. (This is made most clear by the ending of \u201cThe Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\u201d, in which the children shed not just the events of the book, but years of living in Narnia, in a few seconds, just as they would have if Narnia was merely a game they were playing.) However, despite what Vernon\u2019s introduction suggests, I think that much more recent portal fantasy deals with this problem in one way or another. The best of Catherynne Valente\u2019s Fairyland books is the first one, which succeeds precisely because it attempts to demonstrate that Fairyland is a real place, with potential dangers that cannot be overcome in typical adventuring fashion. But in the first book, it is the villain, the Marquess, who has faced these dangers, and Valente proves unwilling to expose her heroine September to them as well, which reduces the power of the subsequent four books. The strongest sections of Ursula LeGuin\u2019s \u201cThe Beginning Place\u201d are those which show Irena slowly coming to the realization that Tembreabrezi is its own place, and not just a refuge where she can find the home life she never had. China Mieville\u2019s \u201cUn Lun Dun\u201d emphasizes the realness of its alternate London by having a stronger connection than one at first realizes between that London and ours; Neil Gaiman\u2019s \u201cNeverwhere\u201d is, to some extent, about the slow realization that the alternate London is actually just as real as the one we know (and something similar could be said for \u201cStardust\u201d and \u201cA Game of You\u201d). Pamela Dean\u2019s \u201cThe Secret Country\u201d goes so far as to make this question its premise: the titular country was part of a game that the children have been playing for years, and the tension in the book stems from the question of whether events in the actual country will follow the plot of the original game, and whether or not the children even want them to.In some ways, \u201cSummer in Orcus\u201d doesn\u2019t address the question of Orcus\u2019s reality as directly as any of the above-mentioned books. Instead, Vernon handles the issue with a neat bit of storytelling ju-jitsu: Baba Yaga (hen-footed house and all) offers to grant Summer, our heroine, her heart\u2019s desire, but neglects to tell Summer, who isn\u2019t sure herself, what it is, instead simply sending her off to Orcus without even telling Summer that she is going somewhere else. The result is that a story that initially seems to be all about Summer gets flipped onto its head, with Summer serving almost as a pawn. Baba Yaga\u2019s name drives Summer forward, attracting help and friends, as well as enemies who are convinced that anyone Baba Yaga has sent must be dangerous, and, just as importantly, convincing Summer, who, unsurprisingly, often feels out of her depth, not to mention scared to death, that maybe she can do something to help. (And, of course, Summer has read a number of portal fantasies, and so has the feeling that she ought to be trying to do something at least a little bit heroic.) Nonetheless, it is her companions who do most of the hard work, as of course they must, given that Summer is a 12-year-old girl who lacks local knowledge, magical abilities, or fighting skills. These last are hardly called for anyway: there is just one short, sharp fight, in which Summer, despite showing some courage and getting to flail about a bit with a sword (well, large knife), nonetheless plays a minor role, and which she does not enjoy at all. Instead, Summer\u2019s skill, more plausible and just as effective in its way as the ability to wield a sword, is in talking to people, and in the inevitable final confrontation \u2014 not even Vernon can avoid the necessity for such a thing \u2014 this turns out to be the key, and the reason why Baba Yaga chose her. Still, even when accomplishing her task, Summer is someone with a specific skillset that happens to be appropriate to the problem, not a hero (something the book emphasizes several times), and so the sense of her as a real person is never lost the way it can be with heroes. Even her ability to talk to people comes from a decidedly mundane source, namely years of dealing with her overbearing, deeply possessive mother. In keeping with this, though there must be a final confrontation, Vernon deliberately limits its scale: Summer has not prevented the destruction of the world, or defeated a Dark Lord, but merely, as Baba Yaga says, \u201cmade things generally more pleasant for most of [Orcus\u2019s] inhabitants.\u201d The modesty and feasibility of this success are of a piece with a story that doesn\u2019t try to do too much.Of course, the danger of not doing too much is that you end up doing too little: luckily, with Vernon there is no fear of that. She is well aware that the kind of realism she is aiming at does not require her to restrain her imagination or her sense of humor, as she makes clear with the weasel companion that Summer acquires at the beginning of the story (an upgraded version of the hedgehog from \u201cThe Seventh Bride\u201d). And so we have were-houses and giant snails, glow-in-the-dark scorpions and manticore cheese (it gives you courage), horse/spider hybrids (called, naturally, Sleipnerians) and wight-flies, warrior geese (it\u2019s about time somebody recognized the fierceness of geese, rather than always defaulting to having birds of prey as the fighting avians) and my personal favorite, Reginald Almondgrove, the aristocratic hoopoe, and his valet-flock, an amusing Wodehouse homage that works much better than you might expect. And Vernon does a good job with her characters, too, starting with Summer, who is not just a bundle of the kind of realistic character traits that Vernon wants to see in a portal fantasy heroine, but a real character whose indecisions and self-doubts we can empathize with since they are not forced on her by the author but instead arise organically from the novel and challenging situations she finds herself in. Consonant with the rest of the story, Summer\u2019s growth as a character is incremental, but it\u2019s still there, and that fact that Summer really is affected by the book\u2019s events goes far to cement the realism of Orcus. Summer\u2019s friends are somewhat less interesting: Reginald, with his indecipherable slang and Drones Club insouciance, is an excellent source of comic relief, but not necessarily all that interesting of a character, and Glorious the were-house is an excellent, high-quality sidekick, but is still just a sidekick. Baba Yaga manages to appear both wise and dangerous, despite her ongoing, slapstick cross-talk act with her house (though I suspect that this is in part designed to distract you from wondering why she's there at all). But as is often the case, it\u2019s the villains who impress the most (which is more important, really: without a good villain, a story of this sort tends to lose its way). Zultan Houndbreaker, though not a world-threatening menace, is nonetheless dangerous and evil, but he\u2019s also intelligent, self-deprecating, and bookish, traits which are rarely ascribed to villains of his type and which help to make him far more than a standard-issue bad guy. And the antelope woman, who lies fluently and constantly, with the possible exception of the times when she warns you that she\u2019s lying, and wants only whatever will create the most amount of chaos in any given situation, is perhaps the book\u2019s most brilliant creation. The result is that the story never feels cramped or overly small, despite its limited scope. I don\u2019t think that \u201cSummer in Orcus\u201d is as big of a break with the portal fantasy tradition as Vernon seems to believe, but that doesn\u2019t prevent it from being a very good book."}, {"userName": "Elana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9533320-elana", "userReview": "This is a book I would have loved when I was twelve and I still love it today.

And speaking of Summer, she's so relatable, and practical, (and genre aware) and ... real, and adult in ways kids shouldn't have to be, but so many actual non-fictional kids are. There were a few parts of the book that i thought were perhaps too...real for a kids book, but then maybe the problem is that the books that the story is riffing off of were never truly real enough. I don't think I'm doing a good enough job conveying how wonderful this book is, but considering i kind of just want to flail around and tell you to just go read it and you will understand, i suppose this will have to do. its so hard for me to articulate how perfect Ursula Vernon's writing is, but it is, and you should go read this book, now.
