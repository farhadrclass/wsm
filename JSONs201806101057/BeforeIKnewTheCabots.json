Just take everything the characters do, and don't do that. I finished this with equal parts masochism and delight. I'm ashamed to admit that the delight was anticipation of being able to vent my wrath on a deserving target. I don't like what that says about me, so I'm rethinking how much vitriol I want to indulge.Colby and Alec spend the entire novel vying for biggest idiot. Whether it's Colby interfering with his running of the kitchen (I swear, she didn't have a single \"suggestion\" where I didn't cringe at the stupidity and ignorance each idea represented) or Alec's self-loathing or Colby's holding to secrets that were stupid to keep in the first place or Alec's assuming responsibility for the idiocy of everyone else. The amount of fail spread between these two was astonishing. And the entire novel, all of it, could have been circumvented by a single conversation where Colby says \"Hey, my dick of a husband had bipolar disorder and refused to get treatment\" and Alec says \"yeah, he wrote me a letter demanding forgiveness or he'd end it all\" and they both go \"huh, untreated bipolar disorder sucks\" and then move on to things they can actually do something about. Bipolar disorder does suck, as I know all too intimately. And this story could have worked to dispel myths, or spread understanding, or, I dunno, not screwed up literally everything about it. Only no, it decided to take an extreme type 1 case and couple it with furtive secrecy and then add guilt for not being able to control someone else's problems when they aren't interested in having control, themselves. So unhealthy in every way and on every dimension. And again, exactly what you shouldn't do if this were to happen to you.So they're both hung up on secrets from their past. And that sucked. But then they each added even more dysfunction to their relationship on top because they're young and immature and don't deserve nice things. Okay, they aren't young. They just act like people who've never had emotional relationships before. Let me give you an example from early in the book. We have Colby musing on the way to her mother's place about how her mom is all alone and there's strife between her mom and dad and she feels bad for her mom and will be forever loyal to her mom because, and I para-quote, \"she's the only person who gives me unconditional love\". And then we meet the mom. And mom spends the entire conversation manipulating Colby to buy her things or it's proof that Colby doesn't love her and she might as well be entirely alone and unloved. This is, apparently, Colby's idea of unconditional love?And I kept waiting for any kind of narrative indication that these things were broken because I couldn't believe that Beck actually meant to show this relationship as one that is healthy for Colby to maintain in status quo. And nothing. Mom sabotages Colby time and again through her narcissistic selfishness and it's like we're supposed to find it amusing or quirky and sympathize with Colby's sacrifice for her mom because that's where she gets unconditional love. Wut? And I wish that were the most damaging parent-child relationship in the book, but it isn't. Alec's dad is a monster whose behavior is unrelentingly damaging for the whole story. It was so bad, it was practically inhuman. Nobody treats their child that relentlessly bad without having serious psychological damage. We're supposed to believe that it's all grief for losing a son, but his grief was unbelievably extreme and has persisted for years with zero change.So we have primary characters where the best, kindest read makes them immature and stupid. And secondary characters who, at best, are damagingly, sometimes brutally, selfish. Fortunately, when we get past that and start to heal it gets much better.Psych! I totally lied. It gets worse!That's right, once the secrets come out and Colby's mom is mitigated and Alec's dad castigated, we have both romantic leads pull more juvenile nonsense. Colby goes into \"I know what's best and will protect others through information withholding\" (recall that this is what tanked her marriage to the bipolar bear). And Alec decides that Colby is better off with someone else because he's a useless jerk who could have prevented all the tragedy in the world and didn't because he stupidly didn't know everything and/or accurately predict every possible bad outcome. Yeah, it's like negative motivation* had a child with inappropriate guilt and named it Alec.By the end of the story, I was literally screaming in my head \"These people don't deserve to have a relationship, they need to go back into the oven and finish baking first!\" I mean, with that title, I expected them to keep stupid secrets and then get drama all over the place when they came out. So I gave it a pass, at least partially, for the buildup. I did not expect Beck to throw every immature stupidity she could lay hands on for extra spice. It's like if a big-time chef staged a comeback by creating an all-comfort-food, greasy-diner menu and then sourced the ingredients from every other restaurants' three-day-old leavings.So yeah. One star. I'd go lower if I could. I don't seem to have managed to stem the vitriol so I guess I'm still working on being the better person...A note about Steamy: Among everything else Beck screws up, this is possibly the mildest. There are a couple of scenes that are sex. Kind of. I mean, it's graphic enough to trigger the steam tag. But before the clothes even come fully off, Beck engages some kind of euphemism overdrive and everything becomes unlikely imagery and elided details. So this is the lightest of my steam tolerance only with an added dose of \"what the heck did I just read?!?\"* Negative Motivations: I kind of hate that the term \"negative motivation\" isn't widespread, yet. Since it isn't, I'm going to save off this little jag to append to my reviews that feature the term. Jennifer Crusie blogged about it a bit back and it changed how I understand story. The problem with the term is that if you've never heard it before, you'd assume it meant motivations that are harmful or immoral. Not so. What it refers to is motivations not to do something. The thing is that many of us are motivated to not do things for a lot of different, perfectly valid and reasonable, reasons. The problem is that in a story motivations to not do things are a huge drag on the plot\u2014particularly considering the fact that most negative motivations are overcome by the character simply deciding they don't care any more (or, rather, that they do care and are now motivated to do the thing). So not only do you have a counter to action but you also have a situation where to overcome it, all a character has to do is change their mind. Which means eventually, the reader is rooting for the character to get over him/herself already and do the thing we want them to do. Conflict drives story. Conflict between a reader and a main character drives readers away from story."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14045562-amy", "userReview": "Before I Knew is the first in a new series following the Cabot family. It\u2019s billed as a romance and it most certainly is, but this wasn\u2019t the lighthearted read I was expecting it to be and unfortunately I didn\u2019t love it as much as I had hoped because of this. I like to escape with a romance as a break from the dark thrillers that make up the majority of my TBR and since much of this one deals with heavy, depressing topics it wasn\u2019t quite the break I was expecting. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was well written and overall an enjoyable read, I just wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind when I started it.This focuses on Colby as she\u2019s grieving the loss of her husband Mark and trying to move on with her life. I did like Colby and found her to be relatable and interesting, but everything she\u2019s been through was so heartbreakingly sad I felt emotionally drained myself. This isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing as anytime an author makes me feel something I\u2019m impressed because that\u2019s one of the main reasons I read a book in the first place. Alec had a similarly devastating history as well so there wasn\u2019t much levity to break up the angst they were both experiencing.Overall this was a well thought out and well written story that was on the darker side compared to most romances I read. I was interested in the characters but not overly invested in them which is a shame. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll be continuing with this series as I prefer to keep my romances light and my thrillers dark, but if you want a romance that has depth and darkness without violence and gore try this!"}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9010166-alison", "userReview": "The Cabot and the Morgans were friends and neighbours for thirty years until a stupid dare left Joe Morgan dead, shortly afterwards Colby Cabot's husband Mark killed himself over his part in the dare, devastated by his role in the death of his best friend and unable to deal with the guilt. Mark was bi-polar and Colby suffers from the knowledge that she kept his diagnosis from her family, she also worries that his illness may have been a contributing factor to the dare that led to Joe's death.Two years later Colby has given up her job as a lawyer to open a restaurant called ACertainTea, she has visions of it being a centre for families to come to celebrate special events. The money for the restaurant has come from the family business The Cabot Tea Company and her father has insisted that Colby reports to her brother Hunter. Alec Morgan has always stood in the shadow of his younger brother Joe, quieter and more studious by nature he was no match for Joe's athleticism and Joe was always his father's favourite. He has also always harboured a secret crush on Colby. Formerly a successful restaurateur, he has had a massive professional disaster, lost his restaurant and has been asked by his old friend Hunter Cabot to assist Colby in her new start-up. Alec too has a secret, Mark wrote him a letter begging for forgiveness and making wild threats which Alec ignored.So, can two people who have suffered devastating losses which intimately involve their families ever put the past aside?This book, for me, was killed by all the angst. Angst over Joe's death, over Mark's suicide, over Colby's mother, over Colby's father, over Alec's mother, over Alec's father, over Colby's brother, over Colby's step-sister, over Colby's sister-in-law. You get the picture, we were drowning in angst and Colby felt she had to fix everything, which was a joke because her brother and father, even Alec were so damned patronising I wanted to punch them in the gonads. But then Colby was so damn drippy and saintly that I wanted to throat-punch her too!Stepping aside from my own personal feelings about the characters, I also felt that Alec's characterisation didn't really 'work'. He was a former geek, the full \"jigsaw puzzle making, then take a photo and hang it on your wall\" Monty who grew into a demanding chef who shouted at people. He had loved Colby all his life and talked about doing anything she wanted, just to get her to notice him, but then he refused to change HIS menu for HER restaurant to accommodate her very reasonable request that there be some simple food for the unadventurous eaters.Someone (an author whose book I criticised) once told me that if the characters make you feel something (even incandescent rage) then the author has achieved their goal - well done Jamie Beck, back of the net goal! But seriously, I'm not a fan of all the introspective, navel-gazing, talk about our feelings (but of course don't actually tell people what's wrong) angst.

The time flew as I did.I thoroughly enjoyed this realistic love story. Lately I've been turned off by the plethora of so-called romance books where the sex is more important than the relationship. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Before I Knew dove into the relationship head-long and kept it interesting from start to finish. There was just enough sexual tension to give it a kick, but there was nothing explicit. I found that refreshing.I felt like the characters were real people and I cared about what happened to them.

She has decided to open a restaurant and her childhood friend Alec has been hired as the new chef. Alec is also ready to make changes in his life. His brother Joe died just over two years prior to this and Alec has since suffered from depression and career setbacks. Joe had also been friends with Colby and her husband. Needless to say there is a lot of past history between Colby and Alec. Alec wants to run an upscale restaurant and is determined to reclaim his status as an award winning, renowned chef. Colby has other ideas. She wants a more moderate style of restaurant. These are just some of their issues. They also both have trust issues, family issues and secrets they have withheld.

Unfortunately, Before I Knew just didn't do it for me. It was so heavy, such a downer that I couldn't find my way through to the end with any kind of joy, any kind of excitement, any kind of anything positive. It's not horribly written or anything, it's just that it's such a dreary, down on themselves kind of story that I could not connect with it or any of the characters.Colby has lost her husband to suicide. Right before that, they both lost a good friend, whose death Colby's husband had an inadvertent hand in. Two years later, Colby has decided to open up a restaurant called A CertainTea. Her father's investment in the restaurant comes with a caveat: she is to answer to her brother, Hunter. That's not such a bad thing, as she's close to her brother, but what's bad is that her brother insists she hire a family friend, Alec, as the new chef. Alec is the younger brother of the man whose death Colby's husband, Mark, had an inadvertent hand in, and that death lead to a severing of Colby's relationship with Alec and his family, as she never got over the guilt she felt, and no one in Alec's family ever forgave Mark for his part in Joe's death.But, there could be a silver lining in Colby's new situation - unbeknownst to Colby, Alec always had a crush on her from the time they were kids and Colby became his, Joe's and Hunter's little sidekick. But, Alec was always in his charismatic, athletic brother, Joe's shadow, and he never found the gumption to ever do anything about his feelings back then, so Mark swooped in and grabbed her up. Now that she's single, and Alec and she are working closely together, perhaps this is Alec's chance to do something about those pesky feelings.Alas, things are not going smoothly. There are too many hurt feelings between the two. Too many feelings of guilt on both their parts. And Colby is a martyr. Ugh, martyrs. I hate it when a character martyrs themselves for someone, especially when the person for whom they're martyring themselves is no longer present. Colby was such a doormat, such a martyr and it drove me nuts. Not to mention she was so prissy and self-absorbed that I wanted to smack her! Not that Alec was any better. He was angry, bitter and lashed out more than once. I get that everyone was hurting, but you have to take responsibility for your own actions, for what you say to others, regardless of whether you are hurting or not. And Alec didn't like taking responsibility for his cruel words until the very end. So we've got a prissy martyr and a bitter, angry hero, not a great combination.So, sorry, but I cannot get behind Before I Knew. I need more vitality, more passion, more life to my romances and Before I Knew didn't give that to me.I received an ARC through NetGalley for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Book Lover", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29645151-book-lover", "userReview": "The Morgans and Cabots live next door to each other.

Before I knew is the start of a new series, The Cabots. Books dealing with grief are not my favourite, especially when it is one of the main themes in a story. However, with this said I still enjoyed this book. It has a lot going on, and the story was really interesting.Colby Cabot-Baxter lost her husband 2 years ago and has never recovered. It's not because he was the love of her life, or she can't imagine life without him. She can't get over the circumstances surrounding his death. Growing up she has always been close with the boys next door, Joe and Alec. Her husband and Joe were involved in an incident that leads to both of their deaths. Joe accidentally kills himself taking part in a stupid dare, and Mark, her husband committed suicide as an after effect. Colby's relationship with Alec became non-existent, and they both lost everything. 2 years later they are both ready to try, and fix their life's and families.

The writing style was great and the plot moved along at a good clip. I'm a sucker for long-pined for romances so this was very easy for me to get into.The story was clearly present day but the exact dates didn't weigh on the plotline and I liked that I could read it and be completely absorbed in it without wondering about dates. It just didn't matter. So with that being said my biggest issue with it was what felt like 2 very forced cultural references, one to youtube videos and a throwaway reference to Game of Thrones that maybe a half of the readers will get. I was so involved in the story and these jarred me out of my little mental bubble.I initially had some other iffy feelings about repeated arguments but I thought about the characters some more and with their backstory and motivations it was actually logical that they would have the same discussion a few times (looking at you menu selection). So overall I really liked it and will definitely be reading more of this author!"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/727334-amy", "userReview": "This romance grabbed me immediately and never let go. I did not want to put it down for anything. I think part of that was that the novel focused on relationships not the sex. It was very thoughtful and went deep into the emotional components of the story. I found that satisfying and a relief. Sometimes, romance can start to feel like they\u2019re all about sex. It was nice to read one focused on a relationship as a whole. Now, there is a lot of angst here by nature of the story itself (loss, grief, suicide, etc.). It\u2019s not necessarily a happy romance although it ultimately gets where you want it to go. This is nitpicky but the main character\u2019s name \u2013 Colby \u2013 kept throwing me as it felt like a masculine name and yet she\u2019s a woman. Other than that there isn\u2019t really a thing wrong with the story that I can think of. I loved this reading experience and feel like it was a romance with heart and soul. I\u2019m eager to see what\u2019s to come with this series (this is the first in a new series). NOTE: Thank you to the publisher for providing a free ARC of this book for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Lisa Aiello", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58092270-lisa-aiello", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book through NetGalley for my honest reviewThere are so many romance books out there that follow the same path, but every now and then you get one that has something special, that makes it just a little different...and this is one of those stories.

I found it in the trending this week section hoping for a good read and ended up with a flop. The book was whiny and uninteresting. It also heavily featured the author's voice rather than writing so I can feel the characters voices. Even having this be the first book in the series there were several times I thought to myself while reading \"that character would never say that\". Other than the author's overly effeminate voice coming through that random points, The book also featured lots of irritating characters that lacked chemistry which resulted in lots of whining without any payoff at the end. Overall this book sucked mostly because it came off sounding deep and interesting from the book cover, which just increased my disappointment in the end"}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22100162-beverly", "userReview": "BEFORE I KNEW is an exceptional first book in Jamie Beck's new series THE CABOT'S. I was heartbroken before the end of chapter one and relished my heart being mended as Ms Beck wove her magic throughout the remainder of the story.Jamie Beck has a knack for being able to pull a reader into her stories with potent plot lines and magnificently strong, yet flawed characters. These characteristics are certainly present in BEFORE I KNEW and each enhances the story and allows for readers to be totally engaged.Colby and Alec, the main characters, as well as a host of secondary characters, are suffering from the loss of a friend and a family member. Colby and Alec are especially affected by the losses and are attempting to forge their way forward even though each is burdened with secrets and lies causing overwhelming grief and guilt. I felt the pain of their mistakes as they traveled their own paths towards a second chance life with each other. My tears were real and my happiness boundless as Colby and Alec finally learn the importance of honesty and forgiveness with themselves, each other and their families.BEFORE I KNEW is a bases clearing home run! Thank you Jamie Beck for and engaging, outstanding read! I look forward to reading more books in THE CABOT'S series."}, {"userName": "Janga", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1206531-janga", "userReview": "4.5 Stars Before I Knew is the first book in the Cabot series. It is also the first book I have read by Jamie Beck. It will not be the last. Beck\u2019s complex characters and perfectly paced, layered plot made this an excellent read. Colby and Alec are likeable characters, credibly flawed and dealing with wounds inflicted by people they love. These are characters in whom I believe and for whom I root without reservation. Their story is one of the best contemporary friends-to-lovers stories I\u2019ve read.Beck deftly weaves together the romance thread and the family complications, giving her readers a seamless and engaging story. This one will evoke sighs and perhaps some tears. I definitely recommend it. Readers see just enough of Colby\u2019s brother Hunter and their younger half-sister, Gentry, to be primed for more books in this series. I\u2019m already looking forward to All We Knew, available January 30, 2018. It is a marriage-in-trouble story, one of my favorite tropes.

I loved the story of Alec and Colby. The characters were well developed and the history between was well written and drew you in. To develop the Characters the story was a little dark in places talking about suicide of Colby ex husband and death of Alec's brother but this made you feel more in sync with them both and understand where they were coming from. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.

Now the book does go into more detail about why he committed suicide but since I've hidden this spoiler I'm just gonna come out and say it. He killed himself because he couldn't handle being the reason for Joe's death. It was an accident. A stupid accident because Joe died on a dare. A really stupid dare. Mark, who is Colby's dead husband, was also dealing with bipolar disease which this book goes into a great amount of detail explain it. I really liked that because not a lot of people understand certain diseases (mental, health, etc.) and I love with authors write a book with a character dealing with one. Now Colby feels very guilty because she even though she knew about him being bipolar she doesn't believe she saw the signs of him spiraling out of control. She believes she could have saved him. So, Colby, who is desperately trying to move on in her life in a more positive way, sets out to build a restaurant (aka A CertainTea). She hires Alec Morgan as her new executive chef. They haven't been friends for a long time (since the day her husbands foolish dare took his younger brothers life) so they often disagree on things. They are both easily distracted by their own guilt. Alec believes if he accepted Marks apology and forgave him then he wouldn't have jumped off his balcony. Alec doesn't know what Colby has gone through with that marriage or how she hid that he was bipolar from everyone. Alec also doesn't have a good relationship with his dad---because his dad is a straight a douchebag. I hated his dad so much. I hated how he treated everyone. I don't even care that he started to be a decent human in the end...I just hated the man.
