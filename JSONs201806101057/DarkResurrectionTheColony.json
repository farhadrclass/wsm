{"ratings": 224, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "Last year, I wrote a brief review of Kate Morton's \nThe Lake House\n in which I said that two things are inevitable when authors recycle the same formula: a) you'll compare every detail of each new book to its predecessors, and b) there will come a point when said formula starts to feel tired and past its best.I was thinking about this while reading F.G. Cottam's latest, The Colony: Dark Resurrection. I've now read 12 of Cottam's horror novels (compared with five by Morton - books that is, not horror novels, although it would certainly be an interesting shift in subject matter if she published one), starting with \nThe House of Lost Souls\n in 2009. After 12 books with similar themes written by the same author, you'd think I might be getting bored, but it isn't happening; I am still just as gripped by them as I always was. Perhaps this is partly down to the inherently exciting nature of the horror genre, wherein terrifying apparitions, demonic rituals and intensely creepy moments of suspense are par for the course. While I'll probably never love another of the author's novels like I do \nDark Echo\n (published 2008, read by me 2009), I continue to be excited and surprised by them and look forward to every new one with undiminished enthusiasm. I'm obviously not the only one, as he has a loyal fanbase of five-star Amazon reviewers.Over the last few years, Cottam's work has also developed in an unexpected, but welcome, way. The author seems to have made a noticeable move towards placing women at the centre of his stories - on the sides of both good and evil. Female characters in Cottam books have always been very well-drawn and convincing, but his latter works in particular have been dominated and led by them. The latest of these characters is Ruthie Gillespie, introduced in last year's novella  The Going and the Rise. Here, she's added to an ensemble cast which includes the remaining members of the fated expedition depicted in \nThe Colony\n (2012).Ruthie is an author of books for children, and she's enrolled on a writer's retreat organised by a shady character named Dennis Thorpe. Indeed, he's so off-puttingly shady that Ruthie ends up pulling out of the program. The location of the 'retreat' turns out to be New Hope Island - the haunted setting of The Colony - so it's perhaps unsurprising when the whole group goes missing. While several characters from the previous expedition journey back to New Hope (finding a surprising ally in the process), Ruthie embarks on an investigation of her own. In the same vein as The Colony, this makes good use of a variety of settings - the island is as atmospheric as ever, but there's a great interlude set in Ireland, and my favourite scenes involved Ruthie visiting a seemingly innocuous village bookshop.This is a great horror novel, and as ever I will sign off by saying that if you enjoy horror/ghost stories and you haven't read Cottam, you should. Being a sequel, The Colony: Dark Resurrection is perhaps not the best place for newcomers to start: I recommend Dark Echo (of course), \nBrodmaw Bay\n and The Lazarus Prophecy. There's also the two novellas published in December last year - the aforementioned The Going and the Rise, and \nAn Absence of Natural Light\n - which are affordable and make perfect samplers."}, {"userName": "Josephine (Jo)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5918846-josephine-jo", "userReview": "I read The Colony and was so thrilled to get my hands on this second book in the series! Although it is the second in a series it is a great stand alone read. You will however want to read the first one once you get hooked!In this story we return to the bleak haunted New Hope Island in the company of Dennis Thorpe. He is leading a group of people on a writers retreat. They have no idea what they are about to face on the bleak and terrifying island. One of the writers who intended going with the group is Ruthie Gillespie, she is a young woman who write dark stories for children. She is beautiful, heavily tattooed, a heavy drinker and a smoker. Because of something that stops Ruthie from going to the island at the last moment she becomes embroiled in the investigation when the writers disappear. Ruthie is now dragged into the dark world of New Hope and the lives of the missing writers, they too are not what they seemed to be.Ruthie has to make a choice does she take on the malevolent forces and try to solve the sinister secrets of the Island or does she try to escape from the horror. Ruthie has had some previous experience of the paranormal but does knowing a little more help or does it simply make her more cautious about what she is taking on.More is revealed about the dreadful past events on New Hope, about Ballentyne, Rachel the little wraith, and the demonic being that lurks, waiting.These people are so real, ordinary and believable, they live ordinary lives but they also encounter ghosts of the dead and come face to face unimaginable horror.The strength of the human spirit is shown at its best in the courage of these people as they fight, not just against the horror of New Hope but against their own inbred terror and the urge for self preservation.I was reading for far longer than I should have been at night, wanting to know just a little bit more before closing the book. Words that describe this story? Creepy, terrifying, addictive, chilling.A must read for lovers of the traditional ghost/horror story.I originally read and reviewed this book at the beginning of 2016 but somehow my review is not there! I have done a quick reread of the book to refresh my memory and I hope that I do not make any errors in saving this review."}, {"userName": "Bill Kupersmith", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12460952-bill-kupersmith", "userReview": "We can divide scary supernatural stories into two broad categories, Classical & Romantic. The former take place in colleges & cathedrals, usually involving amateurs such as dons or clergymen, or perhaps simply a solicitor\u2019s clerk who needs to get a document signed. The later are set in ruined castles in the Carpathians or the Pyrenees, often involving specialists such as exorcists despatched from the Vantican or professional vampire exterminators like Dr. van Helsing. Of contemporary ghost story writers, Susan Hill & Andrew Taylor are the top classical practitioners. For honours amongst the romantics Sarah Rayne (tho\u2019 Rayne\u2019s Michael Flint could be quite @ home in an M. R. James story) vies with F. G. Cottam. When @ their best they are extremely scary & can create exotic creepy historical backstories, tho\u2019 both too sometimes trip badly over anachronisms like issuing the wrong rifles or providing postal service between England & Poland for Jews in 1942. When Cottam gets into the Dan Brown stuff he exceeds my limits of credulity fast. Not only is the real Vatican unable to maintain a team of hit-men trained to SAS standards, but it appears that keeping a high-street bank solvent would be beyond their managerial ability.Fortunately in this sequel to The Colony there\u2019s only a brief and calamitous appearance by a member of the clergy. The very spooky island setting in the teeth of Atlantic gales does its gloomy magic. While the witchdoctor\u2019s curse seems still to be working, the more over-the-top characters & elements have vanished, but some of my favourite devices from The Waiting Room, such as ruined buildings being apparently renewed and time travelling characters, reappear & put on quite the good show. \u2028Best of all, like The Colony, this book has a sound track, tho\u2019 you have to listen for yourself on YouTube. By email & Facebook, the author himself has introduced me to Kate Rusby & Sandy Denny, & shared their songs. The Wild Goose is totally addictive & Denny\u2019s cover of Knockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door is the best you ever heard.I shall give Dark Resurrection top marks, but shaded just a bit. It stands alone all right, but to fill out the characters recalled to the colours from The Colony it helps to have read it already, & the new characters don\u2019t have enough room to put down roots. But I was delightfully scared by the reappearance of the little girl/demonic horror from the Colony as well as for new insight on why serial-killer-time-travellers are loath to retire. Tho\u2019 I\u2019d not quite rank Dark Resurrection in the echelon with The House of Lost Souls, Dark Echo, The Waiting Room, or even Brodmaw Bay, it\u2019s a book most readers of supernatural horror fiction should enjoy - with their IPad & ear buds ready is the best."}, {"userName": "Nadine Julie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/271928-nadine-julie", "userReview": "Dark Resurrection is the welcome second instalment in The Colony trilogy.It's been five years since the events of The Colony. Cottam has had a fairly long time to think about this one and it shows. In his stable of protagonists, Ruthie Gillespie makes for a breath of fresh air. Yes, okay, she's a children's author who's tattooed and hard-drinking and this is, in a way, a sort of postmodern Mary Sue, but she's also smart, forthright and straight-talking, and she happens to be the catalyst for the events of this book.A has-been author, Dennis Thorpe, leads a writers' retreat to New Hope Island. The group, of course, disappears. Ruthie is meant to attend, but backs out at the last minute. The police come to find out just why she didn't go \u2013 and how it relates to the disappearance \u2013 and eventually Ruthie meets our group of protagonists from The Colony: Patsy Lassiter, Phil Fortescue, Edie Chambers, and so on. While The Colony ostensibly dispensed with its major antagonist in the climax, Dark Resurrection explores the background and legacy of one of the other most fascinating characters: David Shanks. The crofter who filmed the infamous footage of ghostly Rachel Ballantyne on New Hope, David Shanks has also been the stuff of legend. His practice of black magic has also been rumoured. While The Colony isn't too clear about whether Shanks is bad or good (or just misunderstood), this book makes the distinction much clearer and uses a few plot points and some disturbing ancestry to convince readers that yes, he was quite demented.By the title you can probably figure out that there's a resurrection of some sort, but I'll spare you the specifics of a spoiler. The to-ing and fro-ing on New Hope of the writers as they get picked off one-by-one is something of a redux of The Colony, but it's not a bad idea to do this, necessarily, because it does tend to show that really, that island sure does suck. You have to think at this point that you'd be putting up a fence around the entire island and barring access for all time. But capitalism beats good sense so much of the time. The players in the writers' retreat themselves are not much to write home about, with the exception of the elderly Freddie Boyle, who attempts to have his own private Rambo moment in reliving his days as Colour Sergeant Terry Conway after the shit hits the fan on New Hope. Boyle is indeed one hardcore fellow, but, given the Cottam formula, his fate is pretty much sealed. After how fond I was of certain characters in The Colony, finding them now so abrasive in Dark Resurrection was an exercise in frustration until the end. However, the ever-reliable Patsy Lassiter remains a treat \u2013 he's the sort of character you shape an entire series around, and I probably could have gone without many of the others in favour of more Patsy Time (yeah, that might be a thing). Not so much Professor Phil Fortescue, who sounds entirely too buffed and handsome to be the man he was in The Colony. He's gone a bit the way of the Mary Sue. He sounds too handsome and too tortured now. I wasn't buying what he was selling any longer. That said, his interactions with Patsy and also Ruthie worked well.I went out of my way not to research beyond the book when it came to the spontaneous and the consequent because I didn't want to find out it was an unoriginal concept. For me, this particular idea worked especially well and was something unique in Cottam's works. It gave a sort of different voice and workings to the supernatural than I've seen in other novels, and I appreciated that it was different without trying to remake the wheel. Not everything could be easy for the antagonists, or could be immediately achieved. For a writer, that's a smart decision to make, because it can make a lot of sense for a reader without requiring too much questioning. (Down the track, though, one would start to question more carefully the definitions and boundaries of spontaneous and consequent. And they'd also ask about the place of these concepts in the Cottam universe, given that the priest Degrelle from The Colony trilogy first appears in The Waiting Room, suggesting an overarching universe between books.)Overall, Dark Resurrection is a fitting follow-up, although it is frustrating at times and the ending is heartbreaking. But perhaps the heartbreaking nature of the ending is a good measure of how successful a writer has been in selling it to the audience. Had Cottam been entirely unsuccessful, I mightn't have given a damn."}, {"userName": "John Wiltshire", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31591928-john-wiltshire", "userReview": "[basically just kills them all off with almost no fanfare  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Venda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4734638-venda", "userReview": "I received a kindle copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. F.G. Cottam is hands-down my favorite horror author. He's very good at writing what I would describe as malevolent ghosts and hauntings. Dark Resurrection is a sequel to his novel The Colony, and brings back familiar characters from that book. Some new characters are also introduced. Dark Resurrection involves a group of writers who have gone to New Hope Island for a retreat. They go missing, and this comes to the attention of the characters from the previous novel who narrowly escaped the island several years ago. A new character, Ruthie Gillespie, is a writer who was supposed to attend the retreat but had a bad gut feeling about it and stayed home. Having had some previous experience with the paranormal, she becomes entwined with the original characters and their attempt to rescue some of their friends. Ruthie is an interesting, charming character and I liked her a lot. It seemed as if every man who met her fell instantly in love with her, which I thought was a little silly, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book or how much I liked her. I don't want to go into a lot of detail about the plot, because there are lots of satisfying ups and downs and surprises. I will say however that F.G. Cottam writes characters that you care about, and there came a point when I realized that one or more of these characters would probably not survive (it is a horror novel, after all.) I was not prepared, however, for the extent to which this would be true or how upsetting it would be. It speaks volumes as to how emotionally involved I became with the characters, who are all fully realized, three dimensional people as opposed to stereotypes or tropes.As far as the \"evil\" in the book goes, there are ghosts and humans and magic, all of which blend together well. I was surprised by the return of Rachel Ballantyne, the ghost of a little girl first introduced in The Colony. She turned out to be something (someone?) entirely different from what I had originally expected, and I am very curious to see how her story plays out in any future sequels. In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I wholeheartedly recommend it to readers who are already familiar with F.G. Cottam's work, and for anyone else who enjoys a well-told, genuinely scary ghost story (read The Colony first! And then go and read all of his other books!)"}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4569625-mike", "userReview": "Mr Cottam is responsible for some of the best supernatural horror being written today. His Jericho Society is one of the best horror devices in years. This story is compelling. But...This isn't his best. Too many superfluous characters, too many to keep track of and too many to develop an affection for. It detracts from the impact of the book.Which is a pity, because the story deserves better.The wild Hebridean islands are well-evoked, in atmosphere and unpredictable weather. Ruthie is one of the best new characters in horror -really she is, she's electric. The story is compelling. But something isn't quite right.It may be that the male characters are ALL unreconstructed macho men, out to protect the womenfolk, even when the women are better equipped to do the protecting. There were times during the story when I couldn't remember which character was which.There's also a lot of re-visiting of the the previous Colony book, too much backstory -let the lazy b@st@rds read the first book for themselves :-)The recent novellas have been very good, short enough to read in one go, just the right number of characters to keep track of and to grow fond of and they don't outstay their welcome. At 200 pages or so, this is a stretched novella and doesn't quite measure up to The House of Lost Souls or The Dark Echo. I think this book may suffer from inbetween-ness and I wonder where FGC shouldn't go for a door-stopper of a book next - a chance to really develop his characters. He's well capable of it and I'd be up for reading it. Note that, despite these 'defects', I've given the book 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Shree", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4808053-shree", "userReview": "Wow, how I loved going back to New Hope island! I LOVED Colony#1 and was left wondering about the evil on the island and Rachel Ballantyne when the novel ended. I was glad Cottam continued it into another instalment. In this novel, our favourite characters from the previous novel are forced to revisit New Hope island when an entire group of writers' vanish mysteriously on the cursed island. What ensues is an horrific adventure in which we go deeper into the tragic and sinister past of the island and get answers to some of the questions that were left unanswered in the previous novel. This novel, like the previous one is a great mix of adventure, history, horror, romance and drama. My only issue with this novel was that some plot elements were not very believable and seemed forced (for example, a teenager is taken along with the rescue crew to New Hope--that killer of an island-by someone who apparently cares for her deeply...just so that she has exposure to real journalism or can write a term paper or some such thing. Not anything that would justify visiting what could be the scariest place on earth!). That said I throughly enjoyed the novel. If you loved Colony #1, you are guaranteed to love this. If you have not read Colony #1, you will want to read it after reading this book."}, {"userName": "Laura Furuta", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45229377-laura-furuta", "userReview": "Dark Resurrection: A Colony Novel (The Colony Book 2)By: F.G.
