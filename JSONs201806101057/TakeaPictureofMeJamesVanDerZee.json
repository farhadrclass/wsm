James VanDerZee's gift, heart, and passion comes to life on every page through brilliant storytelling and visual artistry.Keith Mallett's illustrations took me back in time and pulled me in as the story unfolded. Each page was stunning but my absolute favorite was the depiction of James VanDerZee's Harlem on My Mind Exhibit in New York. I love the contrast. The people were in color and the 40 years of Harlem's history is portrayed through black and white photos. It surely is a sight to see.I wholeheartedly enjoyed this story and was equally intrigued by the afterword that included a gallery of some of James VanDerZee's work; my favorite piece being \"Future Expectations\" (1926) where he used a photomontage technique to depict both the present and the future in one photograph.

James wanted a camera from an early age, and worked hard to afford one. He became only the second person in Lenox to own one. He started taking pictures, and soon everyone in town was saying \u201cTake a picture of me, James Van Der Zee!\u201dAt age 18, James moved his photography business to Harlem, where he eventually opened his own studio. All the big names of the Harlem Renaissance came to him for their portraits. But as time went on, eventually most people got their own cameras, and James\u2019s business declined. He adapted by starting a business to restore old photographs. In addition, his collection of photos was used by the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a visual history of Harlem. This exhibit brought him new clients, with people once again coming to him and saying \u201cTake a picture of me, James Van Der Zee!\u201dAn Afterword by the author gives more background on VanDerZee and also includes examples of some of his work. As she explains:\u201cJames Van Der Zee saw himself as an artist first, then a photographer. He was a master at transforming simple photographs into elaborate works of art.\u201dDuring his life Van Der Zee took more than 75,000 photographs: \u201cEach image shared an extraordinary story about the people of Harlem\u2026.\u201d He died in 1983 at the age of ninety-six.The author also includes a small bibliography and suggestions for further reading.Illustrator Keith Mallett employs rich acrylic paintings that reflect his dedication to historical accuracy in the smallest details, such as styles of clothing and the way iconic buildings in Harlem would have looked when VanDerZee was there. You can also find a great collection of VanDerZee's photographs here.Evaluation: The prose in this book is not all that exciting, but the story is compelling nevertheless. The author does manage to convey a sense of Van Der Zee\u2019s dedication to artistic quality and persistence. The striking pictures will help spark reader interest in the narrative.Rating: 3.5/5"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "Impressive acrylic illustrations and lively text bring Harlem and the Harlem Renaissance to life in this engaging biography of a self-taught photographer. James VanDerZee grew up in Lenox, Massachusetts, where he enjoyed music and art. But somehow he could never quite capture the essence of the individuals he tried to draw. After seeing a photographer do so, the young boy was determined to become a photographer, earning the money for a camera and then creating his own darkroom. Eventually, he was hired as an assistant in a studio but relegated to the darkroom due to racism. Once he finally got a chance to take photos of the customers, his work became all the rage since he somehow was able to distill the essence of his subjects, retouching the photographs to make them more attractive. Everyone passing through Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance simply had to have him take their photographs. Most notably he used backgrounds, props, and clothing to enhance the images of even the most average men and women who visited his shop. As times changed, VanDerZee's skills no longer seemed in demand since cameras became available to almost anyone. But his work was rediscovered and featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Harlem on My Mind exhibit, bringing a resurgence of attention to this talented visionary who used his photographs to show his corner of the world at its best. An afterword provides additional background about VanDerZee as well as showcasing some of his work and giving an example of how retouching a portrait of a woman in the darkroom could show the subject in a more flattering light. Interestingly, VanDerZee regarded himself as more of an artist than a photographer. There's much to think about when exploring this well-written and timely book. This is another story that needed to be told so that the next generation won't forget about VanDerZee."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2426006-suzanne", "userReview": "James VanDerZee is a perfect subject for a picture book, since his love of art and creation of photographic portraits defined his life. The acrylic on canvas illustrations show key scenes from his life in warm colors and also capture samples of his iconic style of photography. In an era when few people owned a camera, James understood its power to tell a story and preserve a memory that would be treasured for a lifetime. The methods James used, such as taking the time to get his subjects to relax and smile naturally for the camera, retouching photos to bring out the best and minimize flaws, and even using photomontage to layer images, set him apart from other photographers. But what made him of special interest to history was his interest in picturing the life of middle class people in Harlem. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Harlem on My Mind\" exhibit showcased the best of his 75,000 photos and 40 years of the history of Harlem, as well as portraits of celebrities such as Florence Mills and Joe Louis. Historians are fortunate that VanDerZee was present during the Harlem Renaissance to preserve the era on film.The text and illustrations work well together to show the passion James felt for his art and to explain what set him apart from other photographers of his time. The changing times can be seen in the clothing, setting, and even the aging of VanDerZee himself. The book also includes a bibliography, suggestions for further reading, reproductions of a few of his iconic photos, and even a list of which photos some of the illustrations were based on. This is a wonderful example of a picture book biography and perfect for units on the Harlem Renaissance, artists, or Black History Month.I read an e-book provided by the publisher through edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Linda ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5574951-linda", "userReview": "I've read and learned quite a lot about the Harlem Renaissance, but do not remember the name and story of James VanDerZee. In muted brown tones, as Andrea J. Loney tells his story, Keith Mallett shows James as a youth, then growing up and becoming an accomplished photographer in Harlem. He came from a creative family of musicians and artists, but when James tried to draw people, he thought he could not capture them the way he \"saw\" and \"knew\" them. One day a photographer came to town with the only camera there and took the VanDerZee's photo. James was hooked. He had little money, sold sachets to try to win the first prize, a camera! He did win, but it appeared to be a sham. The parts didn't fit. James tried again and finally got his camera. He began, developed photos in his closet and people were so pleased. The rest of his career began in New York City. Like other African-Americans, he moved north in the Great Migration, hoping to have a better chance at a good life.  First starting as a pianist to make money, James finally landed a job as an assistant photographer. There were ups and downs in his career, shown in realistic portraits rather like photographs by Keith Mallett. Andrea J. Loney's story gives a strong idea of VanDerZee's creativity and focuses on his extraordinary ability to take and create beautiful photographs.

Also, I am impressed of how he wasn't just a \"snap and go\" photographer. He set the scene, and stories and characters. I liked that he captured real life but not like other African American photographers like Gordon Park in a sad, political, journalist way, but as an art form. Instead he had people dressing up in fur coat, and studio Portraiture. It is interesting time he photographed the \"Harlem Renaissance \"  My only only only complaint is I wanted to see more of the real pictures, and yes, at the back of book there are some but NOT enough for my taste!
