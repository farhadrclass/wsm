And this - this would be one of them. LOLThere's nothing really original or awe-inspiring here. It's essentially 'Shakespeare in Love' (as it uses a lot of the same conceits from that movie) with zombies and vampires. (Also, there's a bit more \"romance\" than I was expecting, but it was pretty tame as far as smut goes.)But the writing was fun and engaging, the story, while predictable, was fun and entertaining. My main complaint is that the transition from first-person for Kate's chapters and third-person for Will's chapters weren't distinct enough in their voices. (Seems to be the theme for the week.)And, yes, there's a lot of silliness. Love at first sight being the least of them. But I don't think you can pick up a book called 'Shakespeare Undead' and not expect silliness, so I took it in stride.For what it is, it's well done, and I liked it. So there! :PETA: There was one other thing that bothered me about the dialogue. There were times when the characters would be talking and quoting Shakespearean lines but, in the book, it's just their dialogue. This is part of the conceit and similar to 'Shakespeare in Love', as I said. The problem is that when they're not doing lines from one of the plays or sonnets they talk \"normally\" and almost modernly. Especially Kate. So it's a little jarring to have her, as herself, spouting out Juliet's lines, and then slipping back into her normal mode of speech since she's meant to be talking and not quoting."}, {"userName": "Nima", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6083197-nima", "userReview": "keresem a szavakat. olyan ez a k\u00f6nyv, mint valami arany sz\u00e9phist\u00f3ria, csak v\u00e1mp\u00edrokkal. nem mintha tudn\u00e1m, az milyen, de a bor\u00edt\u00f3 alapj\u00e1n valami hasonl\u00f3 lehet.Shakespeare a sz\u0151ke v\u00e1mp\u00edrherceg zombik holt tetem\u00e9n v\u00e1gtatva \u00e1t megmenti \u00e9lete nagy szerelm\u00e9t, a v\u00e1mp\u00edr- \u00e9s zombi\u00f6l\u0151 rap\u00edros harcosl\u00e1nyt, akinek r\u00e1ad\u00e1sul m\u00e9g egy gonosz f\u00e9rje is van, aki nem szereti a kis melleket. mindek\u00f6zben term\u00e9szetesen shakespeare-i szonetteket szavalgatnak, id\u0151nk\u00e9nt az orgazmusuk is ebben cs\u00facsosodik ki.borzaszt\u00f3an gagyi a t\u00f6rt\u00e9net, a st\u00edlus, a szerepl\u0151k. az egyetlen \u00e9rt\u00e9kelhet\u0151 momentum a v\u00e9ge (v\u00e9gre v\u00e9ge), amikoris megjelent Erzs\u00e9bet kir\u00e1lyn\u0151, \u00e9s szolg\u00e1lat\u00e1ba fogadta a v\u00e1mp\u00edrt. elk\u00e9pzelhet\u0151, hogy a t\u00f6rt\u00e9net innent\u0151l jobb lesz, de ha a st\u00edlus marad, akkor \u00fagyis mindegy."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda", "userReview": "Cute, fun, and refreshingly literate, with plenty of au courant pop-culture references.Yes, William Shakespeare is a vampire (how do you think he had time to write all those plays and sonnets?) and yes, he does fight zombies.

He abstains from drinking from humans and raising zombies, though he has done both in the past. Teamed up with Kate, a zombie-slaying machine, Will works at chopping the undead down to size all the while attempting to identify the necromancer responsible for the zombie invasion. He and Kate are also infatuated with each other, though she is married and he is, well, a vampire.There were many things to enjoy in Shakespeare Undead. The writing is above par, and while I didn't care for the shifting POVs, it didn't distract me from the story as much as I thought it might. I also really enjoyed Ms. Handeland's characterization of Shakespeare. He is drawn as a brilliant, though aloof character, often fantasizing about various plot ideas that come to him at the most inconvenient moment. The audience is supposed to infer that Shakespeare ultimately pens The Wizard of Oz, The Sixth Sense, Star Wars, and perhaps one or two other works of consideration. This was cute the first time the reference was made, but by the time Shakespeare started envisioning Princess Leia telling a wise old sage that he was her \"only hope,\" the joke had run its course.Ms. Handeland also did a good job of creating sizzling chemistry between Will and Kate. I truly enjoyed the back-and-forth of their relationship.I mentioned the shifting POVs, and while they didn't distract me, they didn't seem necessary by the end. Kate's first person narration didn't reveal anything that Will's third person did not. Likewise, if there was any mention as to what Will used as a blood substitution, as he didn't feed from humans, it wasn't made obvious. Yes, vamplore is ever-changing and subject to the author's personal mythology, but when the cornerstones of vamplore are dismissed, we need some explanation as to where the vampires who abstain from blood of any kind get what they need in order to survive. Like I said, this might have been touched upon in the book, but if it was, it was done so in such a way it was easy for the casual reader to overlook it.I also caught myself thinking of Shakespeare in Love more than I should have. Obviously with any fictionalization of Shakespeare's life, we're going to see some references to his literary works, but from the stolen balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, to the R&J lark/nightingale back and forth as dawn approached, to Kate masquerading as a boy both to hunt zombies and to act on stage, to the Silvia speech from Two Gentleman of Verona, it seemed Ms. Handeland's best knowledge of Shakespeare came from the movie and not history books. I would have liked some hint at other Shakespearan insight than just from the film. Constantly reciting from Shakespeare's plays was also a little jarring when Ms. Handeland returned to normal dialogue. It was likely meant to be an intentional anachronism, but the shift was very obvious.I will say I thought the last few lines of dialogue were brilliant, and I love where she left this story off.Overall, this was a very entertaining read, one I gobbled up in less than 36 hours. It kept me interested, made me laugh, and while I did find fault with it upon reflecting, the plot spoke to the Shakespeare enthusiast in me, as well as the lover of a good paranormal romance."}, {"userName": "Tasula", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2731817-tasula", "userReview": "This was an alternate history with vampires and zombies, set in Elizabethan London and starring Shakespeare and Queen Elizabeth, among a few other notables of the time. Handeland usually writes paranormal romance and much of this book reads like one of those, with the two somewhat star crossed lovers (Will Shakespeare and his Dark Lady) finding each other as they battle zombies and act out plays. The book is full of quotations from Shakespeare's plays and sonnets, often spoken by the characters. It was an amusing read."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4228172-helen", "userReview": "This is a fun, fast-paced book that will delight anyone with a sense of humor, knowledge of the works of Shakespeare, and a willingness to suspend preconceived notions of what is historically true vs. what might be or could be. Short chapters told from the heroine's first person viewpoint and Will Shakespeare's third person viewpoint keep the reader turning pages. As a viewpoint purist, I found the mix of first and third a little off-putting, but the author is consistent and clear in her changes, and I quickly overcame my reluctance. The words of Shakespeare are cleverly intertwined with the plot, making me smile at each reference and how the situation in the plot reflected the reference. Reminiscent of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, the heroine is Will's inspiration for overcoming writer's block. The portrayal of the way writers find words is also a delight to view since so many writers experience the same difficuty as Will does when trying to explain what he is doing to those who don't write. My only complaint is with the ending. Knowing what I know about ROMEO AND JULIET, I'm more worried than satisfied."}, {"userName": "Raye", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5436095-raye", "userReview": "I love these type of books.

He deserves a love of his life that can not only keep up with him but best him on occasion. Lori gives him the perfect complement in a heroine.

But it was all in good fun. The plot borrows heavily from Shakespeare in Love, but I think that may be part of the joke. It was rather like Pride & Prejudice & Zombies in that way: the supernatural inserted into a preexisting bit of fiction. But not so closely adapted.

Allerdings bin ich auch froh, dass ich nicht mehr Geld f\u00fcr dieses Buch ausgegeben habe.Die Sprache und Wortwahl war f\u00fcr mich schwierig zu lesen. Ich pers\u00f6nlich bin absolut kein Fan von Reimen. Es ist nicht meine Welt. Das Buch ist nat\u00fcrlich nicht nur in Reimen geschrieben, aber da es eine Geschichte \u00fcber William Shakespeare als Vampir geht, kommen diese h\u00e4ufig vor.Das Thema \u201eVampire\u201c und \u201eZombies\u201c ist ja eigentlich ein sehr altes, bekanntes Thema. Ich finde sogar, dass es mittlerweile sehr abgegriffen ist.

For years his work has been studied by scholars, yet for as much that is known about him there is just as much that is unknown. Just who was the mysterious Dark Lady mentioned in his sonnets? Where did inspiration for the myriad of characters he created come from?Perhaps, as many have speculated, Shakespeare had help with his writings. Or perhaps, the answer is a bit more... unusual.Shakespeare Undead is a tale loosely (and I mean loosely) based on a point in William Shakespeare's life. The story is centered around the time he writes \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" as that particular play is referenced during the narrative. Plague is constantly a worry of the denizens of London, but William himself isn't particularly worried. This is because William is a vampire and has been for a very, very long time.Shakespeare Undead is rife with tips of the hat and tongue in cheek nods to many of Shakespeare's works. There are also brief mentions of other's works such as 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Star Wars', which might seem strange but oddly enough fit with the narrative.Historical purists are going to want to stay far, FAR away from this one. Like I said before, while it is based on a real person and a real point in time, it is more fantasy than anything else. Vampires, zombies, and ghosts abound.If, however, you are looking for an amusing, horror based romp, you might enjoy Shakespeare Undead. It left me chuckling numerous times and caused more than one eye roll at the humor.

But who is responsible for this undead force that terrorizes the city? Can Shakespeare control his darker half? And who will make a cameo, Queen Elizabeth or Christopher Marlowe?Lori Handeland has written a number of paranormal romances in the past. She has experience in the genre and it shows very well. The author is able to turn Shakespeare from the writer that everybody knows of to an immortal, strong, and passionate individual. However, his sexy persona does not get in the way with his struggles of hiding his true nature and power. The same goes with Kate, who needs to hide her natural killing and acting abilities in a society where women were not permitted on the stage and must remain faithful to their husband, even if they did not find any form of love between them. Among the romantic moments, there are a number of comedic moments involving Shakespeare, his actors, and even Queen Elizabeth herself. The two forms blend nicely together, neither one smothering the other.For Shakespeare enthusiasts, there are various references to the bard\u2019s work, such as The Taming of the Shrew, Two Gentlemen of Verona, and Romeo and Juliet, just to name a few. Readers will have fun pointing out references and how well they contribute to the novel\u2019s storyline.This romantic and comedic piece of paranormal fun will entertain fans of the bard, as well as those who cannot get enough of these \"mash-up\" novels.

Or rather, a book that you KNOW isn't terribly good and yet it goes by so quickly and you're turning pages trying to find out what comes next. Apparently I am hardly the only person who read this book and obtained this view; that's a little heartening to read!I'm always a little sceptical when two people meet in a story and proclaim their love for each other/ponder if they might be in love. Of course not! What's speaking is LUST--your tender bits want to see some play! So when it happened within the first pages, I kind of rolled my eyes. And then whenever they had sex not too long after, I blushed a bit and wondered if more of that was to come because I had not entirely expected it. I figured the novel would be just, you know, dealing with vampires and the such. Not that it detracts--I thought that the whole love plot was sweet!I thought the whole end plot was a bit hasty, and the wrap up was a bit odd/shoddy, but the last few lines were perfectly brilliant that I forgave the miss-steps.I enjoyed the little nods and quotations of Shakespeare, although others seemed to be divided on the subject. I also thought it amusing when Shakespeare had thoughts that tied into subject matter more modern (Wizard of Oz and Star Wars to name but two), although people also seem divided on THAT subject. Lastly, I thought it charming that he was forgetful and tried to control his vampiric nature with the thought of puppies! puppies! puppies!The copy I obtained was an Advanced Reader Edition, which irked me mildly as I bought it from Amazon (I do believe without being informed that it would be such a copy) with several warnings printed on the book that the said copy was not to be sold. Ah, well. It's why I can't really remark too much on the various errors I found in it ('whole' for 'hole' 'know one' for 'no one' lowercase 'will' when it was referring to William Shakespeare's name). I assume that the errors were caught and cleaned up in subsequent editions.At any rate, this story is a nice one to pick up and fly through. It's not BAD, but you probably won't run out to tell people what you just read, either. It's like what a romcom movie is to some women; it's just a nice cheesy indulgence.

I was pleasantly surprised to see this isn't a mash-up (the way I define them; others may have their own opinion). Instead, the author takes the legends and controversies which have built up around the bard over the years--How did a man from such a low and uneducated background write such marvelous and profuse works of literature? Did Christopher Marlowe write some or all of Shakespeare's works? Who was the Dark Lady of the Sonnets who inspired such passionate words? Why did his wife and children live separate from him, they in Stratford, he in London?--and combines them into a new twist on his personal history. Told in both first person, from his Dark Lady's perspective, and third person, from Will's perspective, the story shuttles back and forth between the two in a lucid and readable manner, presenting a realistic--in the sense that all stories have at least two sides to them--telling of the tale. Throw in a few pop culture references (sounds weird, but trust me, it works), some zombies, ghosts and necromancers, wrap it up in an illicit romance, and you have a lively romp through the back alleys and manor houses of 16th century London. Speaking of those pop culture references, it begs the question (actually questions): How does inspiration work? Can it come too early to be used and therefore must wait around until the time is right and strike again? What if Shakespeare had written Star Wars light years (ha!) ahead of its time? What about The Wizard of Oz or The Sixth Sense? Who knows. But I digress. (I'm also referencing a concept thought up by Terry Pratchett, who probably well knows the joys and frustrations which accompany random meteor strikes of creative inspiration.) And again, I digress. However, I think I have made my point, if I ever had one...wow, this is one ditzy review I'm writing. Lori Handeland has managed to create a new and unique entry into the overloaded para-/super-/preternatural field of fiction.

I knew Shakespeare was portrayed as a vampire in this book but I did not expect the twist about him also having another ability. Don\u2019t want to give anything away. This other ability make Shakespeare unique and stand out from all the other vampires currently out in the reading world. My only issue I had with this book was that it was told through first person. Usually, I don\u2019t have a problem with this but I did ad first with this book. It started with a grown Will but then the story would flash back to when it seemed Will was a little boy. It took my till about a third of the way into the book to get everything straight. Once I did, I was able to sit back and enjoy. Shakespeare Undead will have you come alive for more!"}, {"userName": "Nina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10944935-nina", "userReview": "London, 1616. Zombies \u00fcberfluten die Stadt und die ungl\u00fccklich verheiratete Katherine Dymond, die sich jede Nacht als Junge verkleidet davonschleicht, hat es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht ihnen das Handwerk zu legen. Sie ist ein Chasseur - eine J\u00e4gerin.William Shakespeare, begnadeter St\u00fcckeschreiber und Schauspieler, versucht ebenfalls London sauber zu halten - mit einem Unterschied: Er ist kein Chausseur, sondern ein Vampir.Wie es der Zufall so will, begegnen sich Kate und William eines Nachts und William ist, trotz ihrer Verkleidung als Junge, sofort fasziniert von der Unbekannten. William folgt ihr und die beiden beschlie\u00dfen, sich in Zukunft gemeinsam auf die Jagd zu begeben um herauszufinden, wer hinter der Flut von Zombies steckt. Shakespeare wei\u00df schon nach kurzer Zeit, das es sich bei Kate um eine Frau handelt, doch Kate ahnt nichts von ihrem untoten Begleiter. Zwischen den beiden flammen irgendwann zarte Gef\u00fchle auf und William versucht krampfhaft sein Geheimnis zu wahren...Dieses Buch hat mich wirklich sehr begeistert. Auch wenn ich am Anfang etwas kritisch war, denn ber\u00fchmte Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten als Vampir, eine Zombieflut in London und eine Edeldame auf der Jagd und das alles in einem Buch? Doch ich wurde positiv \u00fcberrascht. Die Story ist wahnsinnig spannend, die einzelnen Charaktere sehr vielschichtig und interessant, der Humor grandios. Die Zombiejad wird nicht in die L\u00e4nge gezogen und mit langweiligen Detail ausgeschm\u00fcckt, es geht zur Sache und die Beschreibungen sind packend. Man glaubt fast, ein Zombie sitzt einem im Nacken und kann kaum aufh\u00f6ren zu lesen. Die Liebesgeschichte zwischen den beiden ist ber\u00fchrend, man kann sich sehr gut in die Figuren hineinversetzen und f\u00fchlt sich direkt ins 17te Jahrhundert geschleudert."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4975002-samantha", "userReview": "Perhaps this just wasn't my kind of book - I don't know, I don't really read historical satire. The only reason I picked this book up was because I won the giveaway for the sequel - which sounded interesting. The overall idea of the novel is promising, even funny, but the execution not so much. I was driven positively bonkers by the variation in speech, tone, and era. At some points, I felt like I as reading one of Shakespeare's plays, which proves the author's lack of research because Victorian Englishmen did not speak like that outside of the theatre. At other times, Kate sounded as if she was talking about someone from our century. Handeland is not very consistent with her voices. I ended up liking the way she spoke in first person with Kate and third person with Will, but it was confusing at first because she didn't distinguish one chapter from the other, other than one being in third and the other in first. Kate's first chapter offers to explanation as to the speaker's gender in the beginning, so when it was finally pointed out she was female I had to go back and take a double take until I realized the POV change and figured it out. I also felt like some parts were just too ripped from Shakespeare plays to be enjoyable - the scene where Will climbs Kate's balcony as SO Romeo and Juliet it made me sick. Handeland even used some of the same phrases (I come anon!) and it just seemed cheap to me, not funny. Or whatever she was going for. I probably wouldn't have finished the book except I noticed the sequel, which I got for free, had better reviews. And I know writers who start bad often get better with more practice (myself included). Hopefully the sequel is a little more polished."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10472116-mary", "userReview": "I am really not quite sure what to make of this. Shakespeare is a vampire and he goes zombie hunting with a, well, zombie hunter. Except that plot seems to be in the background, while the vast majority of the book is a vampire/human take on Shakespeare in Love. This was rather disappointing, as I thought the the vampire and zombie spin on my favorite playwright would be a particularly interesting read. I wasn't really prepared for the book to be a primarily romantic one. Some romance? Ok. But when every single chapter, and nearly every single page, is dealing with Will and Kate's insatiable desire for one another...well, it gets about as old as Shakespeare himself. I know that some people weren't fond of how it switched from first person to third person when discussing Kate's and Will's points of view, but I actually really enjoyed that and didn't find it in the least bit confusing. One of my favorite things was reading how different plays would work their way into the plot as Will would come up with different ideas. The addition of modern stories was a bit much, however, especially when Star Wars came into the picture right at the heart of the climax. I did rather like the abrupt ending as it has persuaded me to read the second book. I just hope the author has toned the sexual tension enough to actually make use of a zombie storyline."}, {"userName": "Sarah Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4114573-sarah-lynn", "userReview": "I was ready to enjoy some light, fluffy, Shakespeare-is-a-vampire-and-the-Dark-Lady-is-a-crossdressing-zombie-hunter fun.Then I got to page 33. \"Perhaps there was something amiss within him because Will's stomach had always turned as much at the thought of murder as it did at the idea of sodomy.\"Murder and sodomy. Really. \"So why did the sight of this boy's eyes and cheek, his chin and lips, make Will's loins go heavy and his hands fair itch to touch him?\" Because the boy is a girl, of course.

So, staunch Shakespearians beware. You must have a sense of humor for this book. The story was a mixture of Shakespeare in Love and paranormal elements. Will is a vampire who has the ability to raise the dead. Kate is someone who was taught to kill zombies from her nanny. Their love story does follow the movie closely and in fact I could see many of the movie elements I recognized in my head. Actually, that sort of made it fun for me.The parts I didn't care for in the book was the mixture of language. Will would speak in his poetic form but would often suddenly switch to \"normal\" speech. There was also a back and forth POV between Will and Kate and sometimes it was jarring as you would forget who was speaking for a minute. I had to reread some chapters over because of this. My last complaint is the mixture of contemporary film within his play ideas. It just didn't make sense to me, but I did see where the author was going with those segments. However, I feel it would have been best to have stuck with the plays he wrote at this time.I give this book 3 stars. Despite my complaints I still found it entertaining. If nothing else, it did make me want to see Shakespeare in Love again. At least this one has a better ending!"}, {"userName": "Dorothea M\u00fcller", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35776744-dorothea-m-ller", "userReview": "London 1616: Immer wieder tauchen Zombies auf und auch immer mehr.

Taking the idea of Shakespear and making him a vampire, who would have thought. This book was racy at times, almost steamy romance novel racy, but still enjoyable. I love how the author explained how Shakespeare could have written so many plays and who his mysterious love could have been. And as with so many stories add some zombies and its that much better. Though a vampire the author kept him the regal playwright I would expect him to be with a steadfast control of the monster he once was and could so easily be again. She even tried to bring him to modern day with my favorite quote from the book:  \"Help us, Will Shakespeare; you're our only hope.\" Will's head tilted as the words seemed to swirl all around him. What a great line for a play... Dizzy as he was with blood loss, his mind wandered to a galaxy far, far away. Battles in flying machines. An old warior. A young one who needed training. A girl. No. A princess. Perhaps a mystical force- \"Will! Now is not the time to drift away to the stories in your head.\" Could it be? Is this why Star Wars is so totally awesome?
