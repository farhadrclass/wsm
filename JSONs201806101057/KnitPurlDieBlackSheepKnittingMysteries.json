The little knitting group had grown by one person, an old friend of Maggie's, Gloria who had just moved back to Plum Harbor with her very young new husband, Jamie. The girls all enjoyed being around Gloria, she was so full of life...until someone decided to murder her. Only problem was that the police figured it was an accidental drowning since it happened in her own pool and her tox screen showed painkillers and alcohol in her system which apparently seemed normal to the investigators.In true Black Sheep fashion, the friends took poor grieving Jamie under their wing and vowed to find out what really happened to Gloria. I really enjoy how they have their little morning meetings and sometimes a few of them will join Maggie at the shop for lunch. This investigation was pretty much entirely done by the ladies in the group since the police had already dismissed it as accidental drowning. I did like that for once the ending didn't have anyone in danger. The case definitely wrapped up well and even though I had some suspicions throughout the book, I hadn't guessed the outcome that tied them all together.Since I borrowed the first 3 books in one e-volume from Overdrive, I plan to go ahead and read the next book before it expires, a good way to cross off some TBRs."}, {"userName": "Anne  (Booklady) Molinarolo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3615945-anne-booklady-molinarolo", "userReview": "3.5 StarsThe Black Sheep Knitting ladies are great characters and I enjoy watching the author flesh them out more.

I'm not well-read in the mystery genre but I feel like this was atypical and not suspenseful. the murder doesn't happen till a quarter of the way through, and they don't even suspect murder and start investigating until halfway. Then they putter around and knit and halfheartedly follow up a false lead until in the last 70 pages the mystery pretty much solves itself.I didn't think the characters were very distinctive, though they were absolutely the middle-aged knitting ladies I know. And the editing was sloppy; there were some glaring typos, some characters saying the same things twice or even three times to the same people, and they even got Jamie's name wrong on the back blurb.The best thing about this was the whole concept (pulled this from the library shelves in a \"that title, tho\" moment) and the details in recipes and knitting patterns, diets, and affairs which I guess is how middle-aged, middle-class American women make up their lives.

It is the second book in the Black Sheep Knitting Mystery series. I have not read the first book in the series but it is now on my TBR list. When I read the title and the synopsis I was intrigued by the concept and wanted to give it a try. Often times either a title or the cover art for a book jumps out at me which I guess makes me very susceptible to advertising or marketing. I liked this close-knit group of women who are all friends and support one another. While the women see each other regularly during the week at Maggie\u2019s knitting store they meet formally once a week at one of their homes for dinner and knitting. They share a common interest and are very invested in each others lives. This mystery involved the death of one of their friends when she was home alone at night knitting by her pool. She was found dead in her pool with both alcohol and medicine in her system and the police deemed it an accident, due to the drugs it was even rumored to be a suicide. At times during the novel the mystery even seemed to just be in the women\u2019s heads, as if they didn\u2019t want to believe that their friend might have been so troubled and not shared it with them.The friends in this novel are Maggie, Phoebe, Dana, Lucy and Suzanne. Maggie owns a knitting shop in a small town by the beach, Phoebe lives above the store and works there, Lucy is a graphic designer who is recently divorces and works from her cottage, Dana is a counselor married to a lawyer, and Suzanne is a real estate agent married to a contractor. Most of the story is about the women and their meetings and lives, very little time is devoted to their husbands or boyfriend and outside interests. The main character of the five for this story was Lucy, but I wondered if the POV rotates between them in the stories because it seemed like with the first one Maggie might have been the central character.Knitting has often appealed to me, I even tried to pick it up one time but didn\u2019t really give it the effort that it deserved. I fully believe at some point I will try it again. Perhaps if I could find a way to knit and read at the same time I would be more inclined to learn it.I really liked how the book ended with letters to the readers from each of the main characters as well as recipes. It added a nice homey touch to the book and made it seem more like you as the reader was a friend rather than a reader.

Gloria Sterling seemed to have it all - money, smarts, looks, much younger, devoted husband and a new circle of friends - the Black Sheep knitters. She sailed into their group seamlessly even though they sometimes felt they were not in her league. Suzanne is ecstatic when Gloria decides to sell her house and asks Suzanne to be her agent. Unfortunately, the first time she shows the house they find Gloria floating face down in her swimming pool. Together with Dana, Maggie and Lucy (the Black Sheep knitters) they try to make sure that Jamie, Gloria's husband, keeps it together. As Jamie shares Gloria's secret dark side, other information makes the girls think that maybe Gloria did not have an accident, but was killed because of some of her secrets. Question is - which secret was the one that got her killed?My thoughts: This was a great cozy mystery. It was the second in the series (A Black Sheep Knitting Mystery) but read very well as a stand alone. It does give a spoiler for the first one though, so if you like to read things in order you should read While My Pretty One Knits first. I really like these women characters, who were all strong in their own rights. Maggie is a widow and a business owner, Lucy is divorced and had a graphic design business out of her house, Dana is a local psychologist, Suzanne is a realtor with a husband and kids. When they got together to knit, I was so envious. (I do know how to knit, but don't get much time to experiment with it. I do go to a stitching zone when I needlepoint/cross stitch though!) I wasn't just envious of the time though, but of the friendships that they share. They were very much in tune with each other and knew how each other would respond in certain situations. Having girlfriends like that is a real bonus! It is sort of hailing/freezing rain out right now and this would be the exact kind of book that I would curl up with!There are also some good recipes in the back that are referenced in the story as well as some great websites to find knitting patterns on!"}, {"userName": "Gaby", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1185483-gaby", "userReview": "Anne Canadeo's Knit, Purl, Die, the second of the Black Sheep Knitting mystery series, is a witty, fun escape of a detective cozy.

This is the second book in the series, but for the most part I didn't feel like I was missing out by not reading the first book. Even though I have no idea how to knit myself, I would have loved to visit Maggie's shop and hopefully learn how to knit. The characters are all engaging and I enjoyed getting to know them. They are also quite funny women as I found myself chuckling while reading. The mystery itself was a good read. I was a bit disappointed at the ending and the ultimate culprit. I thought it was fairly predictable as to who the blame should lay on but the ladies in the story did not seem to pick up on clues as well as I did. This is not really a problem per se as I enjoyed reading the entire book but there were times when I wanted to be like \"Seriously? You guys don't notice this?!\" Maybe they are too trusting as they all seem like really nice women.  Cozies are great to read because they have clean story lines but still have all the fun and action of a good mystery. This book was great fun to read and I really liked the recipes that were featured. Suzanne's pasta sounds delicious and I would love to make that in the future. Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was a great intro for me into the cozy genre and I'm eager to get the first book and catch up on the series.
