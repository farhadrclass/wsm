However, I will first take the time to say that reading this was just like having a conversation with Sara. Honest and funny, she lays it all out there with humility and a self-awareness that I truly admire. The book follows her journey from the corporate world to the yoga world as she recognized that her first career was not going to make her happy. As personal as this is, her book transcends her unique experience, and becomes the reader's journey as well as she subtly asks questions of herself that the reader is led to explore as well. I personally felt a link to the book since I've undergone a similar situation recently with a great deal of upheaval in my life. This book allows the reader to explore themselves through Sara, and to ask themselves if they are where they want to be, and what would get them there if they're not. Without being preachy or overly dramatic and \"new-age\" as Sara would put it, she generously shares what she's learned with the reader, as if she's a girlfriend telling you her story over a glass of wine."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21361553-megan", "userReview": "it reads like a perfect \"chick lit\" \"beach read\", but the arc of the book is much more nuanced than i expected (i had thought it would be \"corporate world bad / yoga world good. period.\" instead i found the lessons to be more universal. it's about having power over our own lives (women but really everyone) and, even though it is terrifying, having the strength (and guts) to shape your life into the life you want. the author's sense of humor and personality also come through."}, {"userName": "Orbs n Rings", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4694420-orbs-n-rings", "userReview": "An inspiring and fun memoir!Where in the Om Am I? is a memoir written by Sara Divello who at the time was in her late 20\u2032s. In search of the greener grass on the other side. Sara shuffles herself from one financial services company to another. In search of peace, tranquility and an outlet for her ever-growing anxiety due to her demanding job and crazy boss. Sara decides to take a yoga class after an invite from the very neighbor she has always tried to avoid. In an ironic twist, Sarah has a moment of clarity and realizes she loves yoga after all and signs up to take an instructors training course.Sara not only takes the reader on a trip through her corporate world but also through her life as a yoga student learning to be an instructor, where she struggles to fit in with the different personalities and cliques in her group. There are many fiascos with her boss and coworkers and when it comes to her yoga, there are the moments when Sara feels she would like to just throw in her grungy yoga towel and call it a day.This is one of those memoirs where one can relate to all the antics of her work life. When it comes to a boss or coworkers, reality is, there are always a few nuts in the bunch. I really enjoyed reading about Sara\u2019s life and I could feel her pain when she was ousted during the yoga instruction and then later humiliated in front of her coworkers. I found myself cheering her on when she decided to stick it out at yoga and also when she decided to leave her corporate job. In totality I found Sara to be an inspiration to those of us who struggle through life while our daily interactions with others sometimes leave us feeling like we are in an alternate universe. Yet somehow we feel it, we know we are in the wrong place, so we trudge on through without giving up until we find that ultimate rainbow."}, {"userName": "karmaforlifechick", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8298063-karmaforlifechick", "userReview": "I received a copy of Where in the OM Am I? by Sara DiVello in exchange for an honest review.Sara has a corporate job but finds that she can\u2019t escape the nagging feeling at the back of her mind, that says she does not belong. She tries yoga as a means to cope with the stresses of her job but she decides that what she really needs to do for herself is seek yoga training to help her find the peace she desperately seeks.This book read like fiction although it is technically not. It chronicles Sara\u2019s real life (for the most part), and goes between her corporate life and yoga training. There were definitely some thought provoking internal dialogue, but to balance the serious nature of the self-searching there were some hilarious pieces as well.This author is definitely good, and this memoir is worth a read for sure. You may confirm, like most of us, that not everyone is as nice (or as enlightened) as they pretend to be and people are just people who for the most part could justify their behavior unless because they seem to feel entitled."}, {"userName": "Ruthanne Smith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19046025-ruthanne-smith", "userReview": "No matter what career path you choose, the same lessons you need to learn present themselves in the people who come into your life no matter how fast you try to run from them. I thought I found peace and tranquility leaving the world of government and moving in to yoga teacher training. I naively believed that the folks in the yoga community were all kind, supportive and real. While I've met some wonderful people who do honestly present those qualities, there were still those who didn't. I also realized, after reading this wonderfully funny book, that there was a deeper more serious and more relevant factor in the author's story -- one I think she wanted all who read her book to discover for themselves. Now, I'm not going to give away everything but I discovered it. For you friends....I want you to discover it for yourself.

At the same time her years of yoga were very amateur and she is prompted to take a next step in her learning and try out a teaching class. This is where I thought the book would become way too yoga and to over the top for me, but I loved that she had an honest experience with a few highs and some definite lows.

By the end of the book, Sara DiVello is someone I\u2019m proud to have gotten to know. Her strength and character is extremely admirable.

Although, I had always wanted to read it, it sat on my shelf for almost a year. I wish I had picked it up sooner! The last book I read with a highlighter was Eat, Pray, Love until now! Sara DiVello is hands down my kindred spirit. The book was more relate-able to me than I thought. It makes me want to meet her and pick her brain and have so many conversations. My own self-perception of being a Type A, OCD, perfectionist made me always believe I only fit in one category or one world. Sara opened the possibility for me to believe that is simply not true. \"If it's possible for an obsessive-compulsive, anxiety-ridden worrier of freakish proportions such as myself to shift to meditative mental silence for the length of a class, it's possible for anyone\" Yoga has quickly become a great outlet for me and she solidified all my own personal feelings.

Sara, a recent college graduate with eyes wide open and big dreams, lands what she believes to be a great opportunity in a financial services company. She puts her nose to the grindstone hoping to make an impression, which is not easy with all that's going on around her.Enthusiasm for a great job quickly wanes when Sara's co-workers begin to show their true selves. Her boss Vicky can't separate her personal life from her work life. A business trip with Vicky turns into a drunkfest with Sara playing nursemaid to Vicky's monster hangover. A salesman, who Sara has nicknamed, The Meat, freely shares tales of his sexual conquests in the office. No one seems to notice that Sara is left to do the work the rest of them have simply neglected. Let's just say, I can relate.At the urging of her new husband, Nunally, Sara follows her dream of becoming a yoga instructor. She juggles intensive classroom training while continuing to put up with the office antics. It's a struggle since the other yoga students are as equally obnoxious as those she desperately wants to leave behind in the office. Where The Om Am I? is funny and I mean laugh out loud funny. The people in the office are real characters. In fact I think I know a few of them! The yoga students are mean and spiteful and I was pulling for Sara to rise above them.

I instantly connected with Sara on a level I haven't experienced with a character is a long, long time - wishing that Sara was my friend in real life. The conversations between Sara and Thea (Sara's yoga mentor) are so real. I seemed to always feel as though Sara was questioning everything I am questioning about life and the corporate world (work/life balance, relationships, personal growth), and her candidness was inspiring. As a longtime reader, it's truly been a long time since I've finished a book with so many emotions. Sad - because I need more from her. Happy- because she found the courage to live her life exactly how she wants to live it. Thankful - because she taught me so much in such a short amount of time. But most of all, I feel inspired. I highly recommend reading this book to anyone contemplating happiness inside a cubicle. To anyone afraid of change - not because of the change, but because of the unknown.

I felt like most the time she put herself in the situations she finds herself in. Notice I said most of the time.I believe that Sara is like many of us, just stretching herself too thin and feeling burnt out. She needs to grow a backbone and stand up to Vomiting Vicky (the boss you love to hate) and to the strange characters in her yoga training class. She stresses herself out about things beyond her control, but yet does nothing to remove those stresses. The yoga classes she was taking to relieve her stress now add to her stress.
