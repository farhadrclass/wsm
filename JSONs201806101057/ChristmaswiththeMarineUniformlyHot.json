When Major Ben Hawthorne loses a bet, he has to buy all the presents for his Marine unit's charities: Toys for Tots and the local retirement homes. Overwhelmed and talking to himself in one of the toy aisles, he is rescued by a professional shopper, Ainsley. Sparks ignite, and the connection is made for a one-night-and-done, but is it? It seems as if they have more than one night in them, and despite themselves, they just may find there is more to their relationship than hot, sweaty sex. Except there is a huge divide between them. She comes from a wealthy family, and he hasn't...that's one of the reasons he originally joined the Marines. Will it make a difference? Hopefully not."}, {"userName": "Jo Reads Romance", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38709467-jo-reads-romance", "userReview": "Who doesn\u2019t love a man in uniform? Especially at Christmas. That\u2019s just what Ainsley gets in this story set at Christmas - a sort of opposites attract tale. Ben is a big softie Marine from a poor background while Ainsley is a successful business woman from one of the richest families in America. But they mesh well together and I liked their chemistry, banter and interactions with each other. Both were likeable characters and Ainsley was written especially well since sometimes rich heroines have to work extra hard for me to like them.Fun supporting characters, too. I suspect that some of the other Marines have either had their stories told previously or will do in the future. A word of warning about the British best friend - generally alright but there are a couple of instances of her taking a \u2018British\u2019 word and dropping it randomly into a sentence. A bit cringe if I\u2019m honest.The sex scenes were enjoyable, too. Not too many to overwhelm the story and warm rather than blazing hot. They bordered on sweet rather than down-and-dirty sexy. Again - nothing wrong with that.While this was a pleasant read - good characters, interesting situations and well written - it didn\u2019t quite dazzle me or keep me hooked so that I couldn\u2019t bear to stop reading. It was quite clear from the outset what the source of conflict was going to be so you\u2019re just really waiting for when it was going to happen rather than wondering what might happen. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing - it just gives a story that\u2019s a little more sedate. Again, warm but not blazing hot.With that said, this is still a good story with good characters in a Christmas setting. I would recommend it to fans of Blaze, Christmas and the Uniformly Hot! mini-series. 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Geraldine Sadiku", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14925018-geraldine-sadiku", "userReview": "Excellent read"}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24986430-cheryl", "userReview": "This is a great holiday story.

What more do you want from a hero? Major Ben will capture your heart and excite it. Only thing that makes him not perfect is his belief that he isn't long term dating material. Ainsley is perfect for him. To bad her father can't see that. The losers he keeps introducing to her definitely explains why she is not looking for a long-term relationship. It was fun reading how they both learn that with the right person they are very much long-term people. Oh, just a warning, you might want to reach through the pages and smack Ben upside his head when you reach pages in the late 100's but calm down. This is Harlequin. They will get their HEA. Overall, this is a great holiday read that is hot, sexy and perfectly paced. ~ Kim Miniseries: Uniformly Hot!"}, {"userName": "Shannan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3064671-shannan", "userReview": "Short, fun, and honest.

There's so much pressure from family and friends (mostly family) and we just want to show them all how great we are and how well we're doing. Allegedly well-meaning family members make barbed comments about our single status or child-free status, and sometimes it's just easier to get a good friend or complete stranger to pretend to be a partner and act as a shield. (The inherent flaw in this plan is that as soon as you can be shown to be dating someone, the questions immediately morph from \"When are you ever going to find a nice boy?\" to \"When are you two lovebirds getting married?\" Literally within the same conversation. You cannot win.)Ainsley doesn't really need Ben to be a full-blown boyfriend, just a date to her parents' Christmas party so that her dad won't spend the entire evening introducing her to random single rich men he knows. Ben needs Ainsley, who is a professional shopper, to help him get gifts for his CO, his family, children withthe Toys for Tots campaign and the elderly residents of a nearby nursing home. (He lost a bet) Ainsley is a professional shopper, one who Ben cannot afford, so clearly, there is a bargain to be struck here.Side note - professional shopper sounds like an amazing job. I hate shopping, but that's because I hate trying on clothes, and no matter how far I come in my career or how well I do, I always feel a little bit guilty spending money on frivolities. But I do enjoy finding the perfect gift for someone else. And having someone else's much higher budget with which to do that sounds amazing.Anyway, Ben and Ainsley agree to help each other out for the holidays, and if a little tension-easing mind-blowing sex gets added into the bargain, then it's going to be an even merrier Christmas.This was a fun, charming holiday read. There wasn't anything groundbreaking here, but I liked Ben and Ainsley, though Ben could be a little too perfect at times. Seriously, I don't think he had any faults. Except\u00a0for his aversion to junk food. But he had a six-pack, cooked amazing food, helps out kids and the elderly at Christmas, looks hot in his dress blues, and says all the right things to Ainsley at all times. He could have been a little more real for me."}], "description": "Subject: Major Ben Hawthorne\u00a0\n\nMission: To make one sexy civvy's Christmas wish come true\n\u00a0\nChristmas is almost here, and guys are the last thing on personal shopper Ainsley Garrett's list.
