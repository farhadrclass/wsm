My sister is 16, older then the protag and the thought of her with a 26 year-old is sickening.HERE IS THE THING: Literature does not exist in a void. There is alot of research that shows the more we are exposed to something, the more we tend to agree with it. So I'm actually not making this shit up. Too many people are saying this book is okay because it's fiction, and that anyone who has a problem with it just can't make that distinction. Here is an issue: there is no distinction. LITERATURE EFFECTS HOW WE VIEW THE WORLD EVERYDAY. the amount of people saying: this is edgy and pushes the envelope. THIS ISN'T AN ENVELOPE WE NEED PUSHED. We don't need to suggest that pedophilia is maybe ok IT'S NOT. If you want to push an envelope, why not go for something that actually needs pushing??lets push something that actually needs pushing, not the normalisation of pedophilia, which does not. PEDOPHILIA IS NOT OKAY. I really thought that was a basic principle everyone was familiar with but apparently not, not when I have to read with MY OWN TWO EYES the actual words \"he is a pedophile and my favourite character of the year\"Now, now let me make a distinction. There is a difference between liking a character who does bad things BUT ACKNOWLEDGING THOSE THINGS. For eg, \"this villain is a bad person, and he doesn't deserve redemption but he's written really well so I like his characterisation but not his actions\" vs\"This villain is just misunderstood and what he did isn't that bad he was in a bad situation that caused him to do it I love him\"basically: cool motive, still murder. ANYWAYThe problem with these books is they normalise and allow pedophilic relationships to be viewed as \"okay\" and they're not. The problem is people reading this can transfer these beliefs. The problem is not every 13 year old reading this is going to come across a 26 year old as \"\"\"\"\"nice\"\"\"\"\" (I say tentatively but I do understand he didn't pressure for sex), as the 26 year old in this. And 13 year old girls & boys who are very, very vulnerable members of our society deserved to be protected. Excusing pedophilia is not ok. I don't care of Wavy is the most mature 13 year old of all time SHE'S A CHILD. Children cannot make adult decisions, children are at an inherent power disparity to adults and that shouldn't be exploited, children don't deserve to be sexualised just because they may happen to \"look adult\". They are still !!! children !!!! Anyway, this is my view: this book is gross, and it's problematic, and it's pedophilia. No relationship between a minor and an adult is ever okay bye."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Right up until that moment it was sweet and funny. Odd couple that they were, they had a real connection. Then he tugged her boot off and kissed the bottom of her bare foot. I could see him doing that kind of thing to his own kid, but she wasn\u2019t. She was somebody else\u2019s little girl.\nThis book destroyed me. I have never read anything like it. If you know the basic premise - that this is a so-called \"love story\" between an adult man and a female child - you might be thinking Lolita! But nah, All the Ugly and Wonderful Things is a completely different beast.Ugly and wonderful really are great descriptors for this story. The best thing about it is the completely unsentimental storytelling that, with its constant switching between perspectives, as well as alternating first and third person, beautifully presents a dark tale of childhood, family and abuse. It's so... not manipulative. The author narrates a series of events, using gorgeous writing, but it's a fantastic example of how showing works so much better than telling. We are never told how to feel. We are allowed to be disgusted, sad and angry on our own terms, and we are allowed to draw our own conclusions about the relationship this book portrays. I came to the end of the novel with my mind reeling, my emotions scattered, and completely unsure exactly what I did feel about it... but one thing is certain: I felt. Oh hell, I felt.\nShe nodded against my arm and after that, we were quiet. We didn\u2019t need to talk. We just laid there watching falling stars go streaking white through all that darkness.\nThe story is about a girl called Wavy and it is a tale that spans around fifteen years. Through the perspectives of Wavy's cousin, brother, teachers and friends, as well as Wavy herself, the story of her childhood emerges as one filled with physical and emotional abuse. Her mother is a drug addict, her father is violent, and her mother's issues with eating and germs manifest in Wavy's behaviour, which, in turn, earns frustration from her teachers and fellow pupils.Then a motorcycle accident brings Kellen into her life. Kellen is a big guy with his own history of abuse at the hands of his father. Called a \"fat slob\" and generally thought of as a waste of space his whole life, there is an instant connection between these two outsiders. While uncomfortable, disgusting and often graphic, it is so emotionally confusing because Kellen is not another Humbert. His motivations in his relationship with Wavy are loneliness and compassion, and he is not driven by sexual agenda. In fact, Wavy seems somehow removed from the regular notion of sexuality, existing on a plane where she is not an adult or child, male or female, but simply Wavy. Just herself.I'm sure it will provoke many conflicting reactions, but there remains one overwhelming certainty: it's hard to not react passionately to it. Whether you view Wavy and Kellen as two unfortunate victims of their personal circumstances, or as a child being abused by an adult who should know better, their story is a compelling one.Sad and disturbing. I don't think I'll ever get these characters off my mind.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai", "userReview": "Let's pretend you have a little sister. Say she is 12 or 13. There's this big older guy she's been hanging out with lately, and you know he's at least 26 years old.You walk into her room and there she is, on a table, completely naked, legs spread wide, he is sitting there, shirt off, pants open, touching her.What do you do? What do you think? What do you feel?That's exactly what I'm feeling reading this. It's not even discomfort any longer. It's shock and pure disgust.Here are some disturbing quotes:Three months spending every day in the same room with child molesters and rapists. The whole thing gave me a creeping dread of myself, but I didn't have to lie in the exit interview. Do you still have sexual fantasies about young girls? they asked. No. I never had. I thought about Wavy a hundred times a day, but Wavy was Wavy, not some young girl.\"If Wavy showed up tomorrow, I'd do it all over again. I loved her the first time I saw her and I still do.\"\"Love at first sight, huh? How old was she?\"\"Eight.\"Wavy was almost as small as she'd been at thirteen. She was all long legs and narrow in the hips. Her tits were perfect, but not even big enough to fill my mouth, let alone my hands. She hadn't hardly grown at all. Did it make me a pervert that I still thought she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen? Did it make me less of a pervert that twenty and thirteen looked the same on her?I think these quotes stand for themselves.A minor sexually involved with an adult is wrong. An adult sexually involved with a minor is a paedophile. No excuses. Full stop. So why is everybody too shy to use this word? Why do I see so many 5 star ratings? Why do people think this is romantic? How can anyone in their right mind approve of this?Yes, this book is beautifully written and utterly compelling. And I hate leaving books unfinished because I feel like I can't judge a book rightfully without reading the last word, which is why I didn't DNF it. But not the most amazing book in the world would set paedophilia right. Not one. So open your eyes.

Before I say anything, let's address the large-trunked mammal who hath set his fat ass in the middle of this ugly and wonderful room. Unless you live in a faraway goodreads cave (which I am totally not knocking, faraway caves are legit comfy hangouts) you have probably heard that the H/h in this book first...get involved...when they are 13 and 24/5, respectively. Now, this is a HUGE problem for some readers on a moral/comfort/ick-factor/whatever level and I totally respect that. I don't presume to change people's minds and I'm not here to try. We all believe, prefer and/or are comfortable/uncomfortable with different things. And I'm down with that. Some people can read about animals being slaughtered and I can't even read about one being left in a hot car for five minutes. Others can't stand violence of any kind and I can read about torture and disembowelment and not even pause in my quest to get to the bottom of the Skinny Pop bag. PO-TA-TO...PO-TAH-TOThis coming babble is merely MY way of scrambling explaining how I was okay with this age difference. And how that makes me NOT a supporter of pedophilia. PEDOPHILIALet's talk about it, shall we? Per definition:\n\n\"Pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.\"\n\nIn my line of work, I have actually MET convicted pedophiles. (Don't ask, I won't get into it.) But let's just say this... Kellen ISN'T one. As it states above, pedophiles experience a PRIMARY sexual attraction to PREPUBESCENT children. They are NOT interested in adults sexually, usually only children - thus the \"primary\" in that definition. They could \"love\" a child in their minds, but once that child ages out of whatever their \"preferred range\" is, that \"love\" is no longer. Now, I'm not saying I would love having a 25 year-old man dating my fictional-hell-hath-truly-frozen-over-13-year old daughter. I'm simply saying that Kellen was NOT a fucking sex predator and Wavy his unassuming fairy-child prey. He loved WAVY. Regardless of her age. Their \"situation\" was a unique one; thus what made it interesting. To me at least, for what that's worth.So, if you are on the fence with this one as a result of the age thing - Again, I'm not trying to change the minds of those firmly on one side or the other. This is intended for those in the middle who are unsure if it might bother them or not - To those people I would say to maybe give this one a shot. After it goes on sale. Because $12.99, homies. But back to the book. I thought Wavy was a really interesting character. She was quirky and different.And she was quirky and different without being Manic Pixie Dream Girl different - which I LOVED.GOD, I am sick of that trope. Anycliche, back to Wavy. I thought she was a really original character who lived a very original story. And, even though she had a really shiteous childhood, I appreciated that - while still difficult and believably tragic - Greenwood didn't make it SO over the top tragic that it made me roll my eyes. Seriously, that seems to be all the craze these days. Authors seem to think that saddling their characters with all of these heinously tragedy-filled pasts acts as automatic characterization. But honestly?All that does is make me roll my eyes and shake my head. Another thing I really liked about this story was the layout. Every chapter it jumped around to a different narrator and POV. Now, normally this would drive me batshit, but the way Greenwood did it here just really worked for me. I thought this format served to give us even more insight into the story and the characters. In some ways, it reminded me a little bit of Nine Minutes in that I felt like Morgan Freeman was reading it to me. In my living room.Sitting on my couch. Against the soundtrack of my dog slurping on her ass right next to my face. #YummyI also really liked the story as a whole and the way that parallels were drawn between Wavy's blatantly abusive mother telling her she was \"dirty\" and Renee (who to me represented the \"norm\") being surreptitiously abused in a similar - and yet more socially acceptable manner - by being practically force-fed copious food and then being backhandedly asked seconds later how her diet was going. Two completely different backgrounds and methods...and yet, kind of abusive all the same, no?So, well done, Ms. Greenwood, authoring like this is truly refreshing. Now in the same breath that I sound halfway cerebral and semi-fancy......Here comes Shallow Val. Now, I realize that what I am about to say makes me sound heinous and awful. And I am aware of this. I'm awful.There, I said it for you, so feel free to skip the snark in the comments. Or go ahead, I need some amusement. But anyshallowend, as I was saying. Kellen kept being described as ugly, sweaty, smelly, fat, greasy, I could go on... Or I could just leave this quote here:\n\n\"I had nothing on my body like the warm damp crease between his tits and belly. Nothing like the muscles that bulged in his arms when he used the pulley in the shop ceiling to hoist engines out of cars.\"\n\nI'm sorry....but...Yes, yes, I know what you are thinking. \"But it's real.\"\"It's authentic\"It's MAN TITS.Now I may be shallow, but I'm not ridiculous. *snort* This didn't factor into my rating or overall love of the book. But - for full transparency - I must say that comments such as these DID pull me out of a few otherwise poignant moments. I really enjoyed this story. And while I wouldn't say it is my \"top all time read of the year\" *dodges projectile objects* it was definitely up there in books I will remember and authors I will keep on my radar. And, who knows, I might end up loving it even more later upon further reflection or another re-read. Until then, I imagine Wavy standing in an open field, the breeze blowing through her hair, saying:\n\n\"I could have told him there was no sense in rushing toward being dead. It would find you soon enough, and before it did there were pleasures to make your heart hurt less. If I lay very still in bed at night, I remembered how Grandma's house smelled. The taste of mint ice cream on Kellen's tongue. Donal jumping on the bed to wake me up....\"\"...I'm real. I'm as real as you are...\"\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXOkay, this thing is ALL over my feed.

I love stories that are a bit forbidden and/or on the taboo side. When reviews started coming in for this book I\u2019d never heard of, I knew I had to read it asap. So I picked up the book around 10 pm thinking- I\u2019ll just start it, see how it is. Yeah. I bet you all can guess what happened after that\u2026 I stayed up all night reading it. I couldn\u2019t stop even if I wanted to. My eyes were literally burning when I reached 65%, but I carried on. When I finished, I thought I would crash immediately but I couldn\u2019t sleep. My mind was on Wavy, Kellen, and their story. Wavy\u2019s story is not an easy story to read. She grew up with negligent parents and no one who really cared about her. Eight-year-old Wavy keeps to herself and tries to take care of her little brother. But who takes care of Wavy? No one. Until she meets Kellen. Kellen is around twenty when Wavy meets him. Kellen works for Wavy\u2019s father, has tattoos and drives a motorcycle. Kellen becomes the only friend Wavy has and the only person who truly cares for her. Through her neglect and his loneliness, their love blossoms. Don\u2019t get grossed out just yet, when Wavy is a child of 8, it is not a romantic love. Not at all. It\u2019s a true friendship and a real love, without any sex, lust or anything inappropriate. There were so many POV\u2019s that shaped this story. We don\u2019t just get Wavy and Kellen, we get many side characters. Normally, I don\u2019t love that in a story but it really worked for the way this was told. I love reading romance books- it\u2019s my preferred genre. But is this a romance? I guess it is. But it\u2019s more of a love story than true romance if that makes any sense. A lot of this story isn\u2019t romantic and I think that\u2019s what made it so special. The love between these two was beautiful and pure for much of the story and if it started as romance it wouldn\u2019t have worked. This is a couple a rooted for. My heart broke for them both and I wanted nothing more than for them to have each other.This is a completely unforgettable read. A truly remarkable read. This author\u2019s writing style captivated me from the start. If you\u2019re looking for a unique and unconventional love story that you won\u2019t be able to put down, this is a must read. I\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be a book that everyone loves, but it worked for me. In fact, it\u2019s a 2016 favorite of mine."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "Wow! This was a spectacular book. I devoured this story. Beginning to end, I was completely lost in this disturbing, yet beautiful, love story.While I loved the story, I know that this is a story that many people will not enjoy. There are several difficult and highly controversial topics in this book. I'm pretty open-minded, but even I had a hard time with the relationship turning physical between Wavy (13-14 years old) and Kellen (25 or so years old). As a fictitious story, I was able to come to terms with it eventually. However, in no way would I ever condone that relationship in real life.That being said, the emotions that this book elicited are the reason that I loved it. I was heartbroken, appalled and shocked by Wavy's daily life. As much as I found aspects of their relationship to be unsettling, I could not deny that the love between the two was sincere. Kellen was the only person in Wavy's life that treated her with the slightest bit of compassion and concern. She was the same for him in many ways. These were two lost souls that clung to each other with everything they had.The fact that Kellen was a father-figure, in many ways, to Wavy for so long made accepting their romantic relationship all that much harder for me. It just was unfathomable to me that Kellen would go there. Who does that?Nonetheless, this book blew me away. I love a book that can make me feel the way this one did. I'm still feeling conflicted and uneasy with the content. That being said, I'm still thinking about it, and trying to figure out exactly how I feel, days later. That says a lot. This book will definitely make an impression, be it good or bad. I loved it, but I also hated it at times. If you're looking for an emotional read that will tie you in knots, this is a great choice. It is a tragically beautiful story and completely captivating. This is a phenomenal piece of work and I will definitely be reading future books by this author."}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "This book won\u2019t be for everyone..and I get that:\nMy thing is: I read a ton of books. After a while I\u2019m begging for something, anything that is fresh and new. This book is that with big brass balls. Wavy\u2019s story is not a pretty one. We first meet her when she ends up at her Aunt Brenda\u2019s door. Her mom is in prison, no one can take her, she doesn\u2019t really talk, and she hates to be touched. It\u2019s enough to drive anyone crazy. Brenda can\u2019t deal with Wavy. She sneaks out at night and wanders and Brenda is scared that she will drag her daughters down the wrong road with her. She ends up with Grandma but even that doesn\u2019t last. Mom comes to pick her up and now she has a new brother Donal to look after also. They return to their life at the \u201cranch\u201d. The Ranch is a meth cooking hideout. Her dad Liam is leader of the den. He uses a different woman each time he drops his pants. \nBut Wavy\u2019s mom Val is his wife, what time she isn\u2019t lying in filth or stoned out of her mind. She tells Wavy her thoughts on men and food. And passes on her fear of germs. (They will get in you)\nIt\u2019s no wonder Wavy is so messed up.Then one day Kellan shows up on his motorcycle bringing them some groceries. He wrecks his motorcycle that day and Wavy gets him help. Kellan is not your typical guy that you imagine a girl looking at twice. He\u2019s big. He\u2019s wooly. He gets told at one point in the story that he needs to use deodorant. But that\u2019s the start of it. Wavy is eight years old. (Not the romance part you pervert-the friendship.)I totally saw him as a younger version of this:\nKellan is one of the only people that Wavy can bring herself to say any words too. They talk about the stars and he just completely understands her. As she grows up Kellan stays by her side. He is the person she goes to when she can\u2019t get registered for school because neither of her parents can get their act together to make sure she is going. He stands in when she needs someone. He is the one that protects her. The relationship between Wavy and Kellan changes over time. With Wavy there is no questioning. She knows he is the only one for her. Ever. Then something bad happens and both their lives are torn apart. I KNOW that those ages of these two should have made me want them to be apart. But fuck that. Who am I to judge someone else\u2019s life? Wavy\u2019s life is messed up. Kellan is one of the only good things in the whole thing. I completely rooted for these two characters. I liked learning things. How numbers worked together to explain the stars. How molecules made the world. All the ugly and wonderful things people had done in the last two thousand years. \nThis book is going on my favorites list. Characters that aren\u2019t cookie cutters. Amazing story-line. Some great writing. If it doesn\u2019t win some kind of award I\u2019m going to be all ticked off because I loved every single word. \nThere was only one thing that was sorta wonky for me in this book and honestly it\u2019s not a biggie because I didn\u2019t even notice until I was half-way though the book. The time period was the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s. I don\u2019t remember meth being the drug of choice during that time period. See the thing is\u2026My dad was a drug dealer during that time period. I think this book got into my heart and head so much because some of my past was similar to Wavy\u2019s. I remember being at school and the police officer\u2019s bringing in some drug paraphernalia and it being some of my dad\u2019s stuff. Raids and a fear of the police were nothing new at that house. (Relax-my dad served his time later and my family went even more nuts into religion-but that\u2019s a whole nuther story) My family is a total Jerry Springer wet dream.Does that mean that I was in a thing with an older guy? Nope, it means I get where this character is coming from. Real life is not the rich guy sweeping in with his red room. This story is more real life. It\u2019s dark. It\u2019s dirty.

Emotional actually doesn't even begin to describe how this book make me feel but it's the first word that comes to mind.The story and the characters got in my head and under my skin and I don't see them leaving anytime soon.At first I wondered about the title but honestly, it's perfect for this book.****Possibly some very minor spoilers****The book begins in March of 1975 told from Amy's point of view. Amy is seven when her five year-old cousin Wavonna Quinn (nicknamed Vonnie then Wavy) first comes to live with them.Amy learns a lot about \"The Tragic and Edifying Story of Wavonna Quinn\" by eavesdropping on her mother when she talks to her book club friends.Wavy hasn't had an easy life so far and seen things that no five-year old should ever have to see. She doesn't talk very much but she's smart as a whip.Thanks to an old neighbor, Wavy can identify all of the stars and constellations. It's one of her favorite things.\"Mr. Arsenikos said if you knew the constellations you would never get lost. You could always find your way home.\"Wavy has some strange habits that drives her Aunt Brenda crazy but endears her to Amy. About six months later, after a late night wandering incident it's decided that Wavy is a danger to her cousins and is sent to live with their Grandmother. We learn more about Wavy's mother Val from Grandma Helen. She explains that nowadays, Val would probably be diagnosed with something, but at the time, they just lived with what they called her \"germ problem\" along with her other issues.When she first brings Wavy home she realizes how very different her granddaughter is, but she accepts Wavy for who she is and they start to forge a tight bond. I LOVED her grandmother. Sadly, Wavy isn't with Grandma for very long.When her mother is released from prison she tells eight-year-old Wavy that everything is going to be different this time. For two weeks she's \"Good Mama\" doing the laundry, cooking dinner etc. Then two weeks later Wavy wakes up to \"Scary Mama\" and realizes that nothing is going to be different. Except now she is not only taking care of herself but also her new baby brother, Donal. Their father, Liam is no real help either. He mostly stays down the hill taking care of his \"business\" and when he is around Wavy knows to stay out of the way. With Good Mama, Scary Mama, Happy Mama, or Sad Mama we quickly learn why Wavy doesn't talk very often, why she doesn't eat and why she won't let people touch her.One day Wavy is out in the meadow when \"A Giant\" drives by on his motorcycle. As he turns to look at Wavy he startles and ends up wiping out on the gravel road. Wavy sees something kind in the giant's eyes and tries to help him. He's an ex-con and associate of her father's and his name is Jesse Joe Kellen.Jesse Joe Kellen quickly realizes that Wavy is all on her own with parents who don't seem to give a thought to her care. He quickly becomes everything to Wavy. He buys food, takes her to school and keeps her safe. As time goes by the friendship between this unlikely pair grows into much more.\"He smelled good. Sweat and motorcycle and wintergreen. No stinking weed smoke. No perfume. No sadness. He smelled like love\"Now this is where many readers may become very uncomfortable. It may make you uneasy at times and horrified at others but at the same time you may not feel like you would normally in this situation. But many readers may find it very hard to wrap their brains around certain parts of this ....love story.We read how Wavy and Kellen view their relationship. But we also get to see how other people feel about it. Not just Wavy's Aunt Brenda and her cousins, but also school teachers, social workers, judges, lawyers, drug dealers, jewelers and many others.This truly is a shocking and powerful book that is controversial and will likely be the topic of a lot of debates. Possibly some very heated debates.Was it all completely realistic? Maybe not. But in the end this is a fiction book and by remembering that it helped me to relax and just appreciate the story. Are my beliefs changed by what I read? Not really. Maybe this sounds strange and I don't really know how to explain what I mean, but I just feel a bit different after reading this.I was so invested in this book, nothing could pull me away (except when my Kindle died and I couldn't find the charger). I couldn't possibly guess how it was going to end. I didn't care that it was four in the morning. I HAD to know what was going to happen next.I am so impressed by this author. There were quite a few characters in this book, and they were all interesting and well developed. I had no problem following the story-line and keeping all of the characters straight. In my opinion the story was fantastic and very well written.So yes, this book may not be for everyone but I'm really glad that I read it and I can't wait to read more from Bryn Greenwood.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Mischenko", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1194517-mischenko", "userReview": "To see this review and a Q&A with the author, please visit www.readrantrockandroll.com.All the Ugly and Wonderful Things by Bryn Greenwood is a book that was very challenging for me to read due to the content. The title is nothing short of absolute perfection in describing the book. I went into the book completely blind and didn't read much about it besides liking a few reviews. I had no idea what was in store.There were a few times in the book I wanted to stop reading. What supported me finishing the book was reminding myself about the fact that this story, no matter how hard it is to accept, is very real. This is a book of fiction, but there are dysfunctional lives comparable to this and they're very true. Just because they're out of sight, out of mind, doesn't mean they aren't happening. The author could have written it differently, but then it wouldn't be what it is. I don't think by reading and finishing the book, you're necessarily celebrating the events that take place.**Spoiler**The controversy with people is the relationship. I get that the relationship Wavy chooses is wrong, but just look at her life. Her parents, exposure, and experiences are not what most would consider \"normal\" and she's not able to enjoy her childhood as it is. Instead, she's having to live like an adult and she experiences adult situations at a very young age. Because she has nobody, a nonexistent family and no support from anyone, Kellen becomes her family and they fall in love.After all, it's just a story. To me, it was captivating. The book is written very well and I loved it. I'm delighted to have discovered this author and I'm looking forward to reading more. I'll leave it at that. :) 5*****"}, {"userName": "Jennifer Masterson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28953843-jennifer-masterson", "userReview": "This is emotionally draining and disturbing.

The truth is that it is not for everyone. It is the story of Wavy and Kellan, two people with difficult homes and child abuse. Yes, it is a love story, but not in the beginning.Wavy is the daughter of a violent man, womanizer and drug dealer, and a drug addicted mother with deep emotional, existential and psychological problems, who transmits to her daughter her fears regarding food and germs.Kellan is big and overweight, biker and tattooed, ex-convict and son of an abusive parent. He is not attractive, but generous, of a great personality and, most importantly for Wavy, respects her space and accepts hers silences without questioning them.They meet when Wavy is eight and Kellan has an accident in his engine and the connection is instantaneous. He is an adult and she is a girl and although it ends up being a love story, it is not so in its beginnings. He realizes how lonely and helpless Wavy is and takes it as a responsibility. Wavy's life is difficult and Kellan is the only good thing in it.She grows up with Kellan at her side, he protects her, takes care of her house, goes to school. Their relationship changes over time, but something bad happens in their lives and puts it upside down.This story lasts fifteen years and is from different points of view, which greatly enriches the story. It is sad, overwhelming and powerful. It will make you feel much more of a feeling.- - -Esta historia no es bonita. La verdad es que no es para todo el mundo. Es la historia de Wavy y Kellan, dos personas con hogares dif\u00edciles y abusos infantiles. Si, es una historia de amor, pero no en el inicio. Wavy es la hija de un hombre violento, mujeriego y traficante de drogas, y de una madre drogadicta y con profundos problemas emocionales, existenciales y psicol\u00f3gicos, que le transmite a su hija sus temores con relaci\u00f3n a la comida y los g\u00e9rmenes. Kellan es grande y con sobrepeso, motorista y tatuado, ex convicto e hijo de un padre abusivo. No es alguien atractivo, pero es generoso, de una gran personalidad y, lo m\u00e1s importante para Wavy, respeta su espacio y acepta sus silencios sin cuestionarlos. Se conocen cuando Wavy tiene ocho a\u00f1os y Kellan tiene un accidente en su motor y la coneccion es instant\u00e1nea.

Gritty, raw and wrong on so many levels; it brought up feelings I wasn\u2019t prepared for.There were so many times, I wanted to hate this book; to throw it across the room and somehow forget about everything I\u2019d read. Riddled with emotion and a level of constant moral questioning, this story toes the line of pedophilia and begs for acceptance. It\u2019s the story of a little girl and a grown man falling in love. Even now, there\u2019s a part of me that wants to hang my head in shame because when it really boils down to it, I liked this story. It makes me wonder - what the fuck is wrong with me? Am I such a sucker for a love story that I\u2019m willing to overlook every repulsive moment between Wavy and Kellan and feel some sort of happiness for the way things turned out, instead? That all of the wonderful things could really wash away the ugly? I guess my answer has to be yes.It\u2019s a guarantee, not everyone will be able to get over the things that feel wrong and dirty about this one. At the end of the day, is it really okay that a little girl fell in love with a grown man and absolutely no one did anything to stop it? No way. Never. Not in a million years. I felt utterly disgusted, repulsed and even angry about it. That I managed to get from that point, to the place where I could appreciate the bright spot in the story\u2014two damaged people finding love and acceptance in one another at all costs\u2014should tell you the level of storytelling that Bryn Greenwood pulled off.

Yeah, there were some things that made me cringe with Kellen but it wasn't the way that it seemed. Living the kind of life Wavy and her brother Donal had to live, there is not anything normal and they only had one savior, Kellen. In the beginning we read about Wavy staying with her aunt and her cousins. She does strange things, she doesn't talk, but she's fun to one of her cousins. Then she goes home with her mother Val. And her mother is pregnant. Donal comes a little later and Wavy takes care of him. Wavy's parents are crazy. Her father Liam doesn't even live with them, he lives down the road with his drug stuff and women. Their mom is crazy train and you can't talk to her at all. I can't even begin to tell you how Wavy lives. How she eats. These are things you need to read for yourself. The only person that cared for Wavy was Kellen. He's older, he's a biker that has done some bad things. But in this world that Wavy lives in, he's an angel. He takes her to school, he buys things she needs for school and just everything. When Donal gets a little older he tags around a little bit too. But he doesn't get treated as bad as Wavy. The kids go back and forth from their normal aunt's house. I really didn't like her at all.

I'VE READ A HANDFUL OF 5 STAR BOOKS THIS YEAR, BUT THIS ONE WON'T LET ME FORGET ABOUT IT. IT DESERVES TO BE A BESTSELLER AND MS. GREENWOOD DESERVES MANY KUDOS FOR BEING BALLSY ENOUGH TO WRITE A STORY THAT DIDN'T JUST PUSH THE ENVELOPE, IT RIPPED THE DAMN THING TO SHREDS.Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/\n\u201cI loved her the first time I saw her and I still do.\u201d\u201cLove at first sight, huh? How old was she?\u201d\u201cEight.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s creepy.\u201d\nHey remember Joe from a couple years ago and how you knew you really shouldn\u2019t like him because he was like a psycho stalker with stabby tendencies, but then you fell in love with him anyway??? Well, allow me to introduce you to Kellen. He\u2019s a \"pedophile\" and my favorite leading male so far this year (and this is book #100 for 2016 so that\u2019s saying something) . . . \nLet me backtrack a second. All the Ugly and Wonderful Things (perfect title is perfect) is the story of Wavy, the daughter of not a real Mother-of-the-Year nominee. See Wavy\u2019s momma Val is a meth head. Her paranoia of choice? Brainwashing her daughter from the time she was three that nothing is safe, physical touch can infect you and EVERY other human is dirty. Wavy\u2019s daddy Liam tries to help out whenever he can by sending groceries and stuff up to the main house, but he mainly stays at a distance in order to run the family business \u2013 a meth lab. He also spends his free time snorting his product as well as smacking bitches around and dabbling in an unlimited amount of strange vajay, but that\u2019s beside the point. It should go without saying that Wavy\u2019s life was in no way, shape or form \u201cnormal.\u201d She had a brief reprieve when she was taken away from her mother, but then stuff and things happened which brought her back home \u2013 and this time (at the ripe ol\u2019 age of 8) she got the joy of raising her mother\u2019s new baby. Enter Kellen. He\u2019s spent time in the pokey and looks like a grizzly bear, but most importantly he recognizes when a kid has been dealt the shit end of the stick at life. Since no one else is around to look after Wavy, Kellen takes it upon himself to do so. He makes sure the groceries get bought, takes her to and from school and gives her a safe place to hang out (the garage he works at) when things suck for her more than usual. Wavy and Kellen fill a void in each other\u2019s lives. She loves him and he loves her back . . . and as the years go by so does this love . . . \n\u201cThe girl looked . . . up at the man with sparkling eyes. He looked nervous and happy. They were not father and daughter. Romance. For better or worse.\u201d\nObviously this is not a book for everyone. You really have to be able to separate what your real-life reaction would be and fully embrace Wavy and Kellen\u2019s world \u2013 in the 80s, living in the sticks in a drug den, surrounded by criminals, drug addicts, rapists, you name it, with no one to trust but each other and a slow roller of a relationship that evolves over time with a leading male who knows his feelings are wrong, but is willing to do anything to make it right . . . \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me buying her a ring. She\u2019s my girl.\u201d\u201cYeah, except for the part where you\u2019re a pedophile.\u201d\nAll the Ugly and Wonderful Things (again, perfect title is perfect) doesn\u2019t pussyfoot around the giant pink elephant in the room. In fact, it does the opposite by presenting statements like the above over and over lest the reader forget that this love story is taboo. Kudos to you, Ms. Greenwood, you get all the stars. If you\u2019re adventurous enough to give this a shot, you might find yourself blown away by this powerful little story too. If you\u2019re not???\nHa! Kidding.

It\u2019s a deep love; a respectful love; a faithfully sound love; a genuine love that\u2019s complete and equally reciprocated. Problem is that pesky illegal and highly immoral age gap. This book challenges us ... It asks us not to condone this love, but to take a long, unflinching look at it. Really LOOK at it. Is this love strong and pure enough to accept through the passage of time, when Wavy becomes \u201cof age\u201d? Or will the technical element of pedophilia wreck any chance of that for us as readers?You\u2019ll have to be the judge. But I can tell you this: there is nothing black and white about this journey.

My sister, Brenda and I decided to do another sister read and this time around we chose ALL THE UGLY AND WONDERFUL THINGS by BRYN GREENWOOD. What an extremely good choice we made in reading this one together. This is by far the best book we have read in quite some time and we have read some pretty good books lately. ALL THE UGLY AND WONDERFUL THINGS by BRYN GREENWOOD is a disturbing, powerful, and an unconventional love story that was beautifully written. We found that her writing allowed us to be disturbed and moved at the same time without glorifying or romancing the subject matter. \u00a0The title was perfect for this novel as we were showed the ugly of addiction, neglect, and abuse along with the wonderful things of love, strength, acceptance, trust, and commitment. Your beliefs will be questioned constantly while reading this one. Is this right or wrong?Now there were a few things that we didn't totally agree with and found ourselves questioning while reading this one but the way that the author delivered this story was absolutely riveting and hard to put down.The author pushes the boundaries here with a story about two lonely, flawed characters who find that their place is with each other and how they are able to accomplish that.\u00a0 Kellen shows us how he is committed by the bond he shares with Wavy\u00a0by changing things for the sake of Wavy and Donal\u2019s safety and livelihood.\u00a0 There is more depth to this novel than what we might think as a forbidden or unconventional love story if you are able to distance yourself from that. The story is told in quite a few voices along with Wavy and Kellen's from their own perspectives which was easy to follow along with all the characters and the storyline. Allowing us to see that everyone has their own views and how it is perceived and how it ultimately effects them.At the end of the book we could not judge Wavy and Kellen, we just accepted it and all The Ugly and Wonderful Things.Powerful quote: \"I AM AS REAL AS YOU ARE.\"To sum it all up it was well written, interesting, fast-paced, somewhat disturbing read, with a very satisfying ending.

If you don't like GIFy reviews - too bad!So this book started and it was pretty good. The main characters live a difficult life and everything is quite sketchy:Then some of the relationships get a little bit questionable:Then, the you know what hits the you know what:From there on out, I just wasn't sure what to think anymore:I enjoyed the writing and was enthralled with the story, but man oh man - the subject matter was tough! I cannot say that I would recommend this to someone because I kind of worry what they would think I thought of them if THIS is the book I thought they would like.So, read it, but if it weirds you out, don't blame me!"}, {"userName": "Delee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6168268-delee", "userReview": "So...this is the first of my way overdue reviews...I have been putting them off long enough. Sorry- First Reads...Sorry NetGalley. I am your worst nightmare, I know.A lot of people have DNF this book on the grounds that it is icky. I am just going to say I don't get it. I don't normally do romance...I don't usually get all teary-eyed over teen angst. I weep over books that are misunderstood- and this for me is one of them. If you stopped reading this for the \"Ew gross\" factor...I challenge you to try to finish it...and judge less. Not all may be as it seems at first glance.If you finish and still have the same outlook, fine- but stopping this one a hundred pages in and thinking you have figured it all out...is not an acceptable starring-in my humble opinion.If you had a daughter...would you want them to have this? or this?One is more age appropriate, yes- but is it what is best for her? Someone who is her age and treats her like crap...or someone who will respect her and treat her with a gentle hand. Sometimes it is not all black and white....and when you realize that someone can have the best intentions without being the perfect match....you can read this book for what it is. A romance that is ageless.Come on, how many of you drooled waiting for the next installment of Flowers in the Attic? That's about as ick as you can get. This is not even close...Wavy- is the pre-teen daughter of a drug dealer and his abusive wife... Kellen-is a drug runner and ex-con in his early 20s. Despite the age difference the two, over the years, they will lean on one another and find love and acceptance- regardless of everyone and every thing that tries to come between them.Right or wrong- I was rooting for them...but will you? Read it...I think you may be surprised which side you are on at the end.Thanks NetGalley!"}, {"userName": "Eve Recinella (Between The Bookends)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/921083-eve-recinella-between-the-bookends", "userReview": "WOW, so I don't think I can write a review that would do this book an ounce of justice, but I'll give it my best shot...Originally I was going to give this one a pass. The ages of the two main characters , and the subject matter just didn't sit right with me as a mother of a 14 and 11 year old. I just didn't think I could go into this with an open mind. That said, I kept seeing all these 4 and 5 star reviews, and I'll admit, my curiosity got the better of me. And man am I glad it did.This was one of the most heart wrenching, uncomfortable, and amazingly written books I had read in a LONG time. Each and every character was so well written. There are multiple POVs throughout that slowly peel away layer upon layer of this beautiful and often times disturbing story. Wavy broke my heart. The things this poor girl has been through destroyed me. Kellan was her everything. Her port in the storm that was her life and her his.Look, this is going to be one of those books that you either LOVE or you HATE. I'm not sure there is a lot of middle ground with this one. Yes the subject matter is disturbing. I'm don't think there will be too many people who are NOT disturbed by the friendship (love) between Wavy and Kellan. In the context of this story though, it worked. Amazing, simply one of the best books I had read so far this year."}, {"userName": "Brandi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5494655-brandi", "userReview": "Wow. What an aptly titled story. This one had me feeling so many things, and even shedding a few many tears. All the Ugly and Wonderful Things is a controversial, no holds barred story - as the title suggest, there is plenty of ugly found within the pages of Wavy's story, but there are wonderful, beautiful things as well. I don't want to delve into to the plot too much, because this is simply one of those stories a reader should experience, and I'm sure each reader will reach the end with a wide range of emotions. Anger, fear, hope, acceptance, disgust. I felt it all, but above anything else, I was reminded of something very important. Love is more than sex, or lust. Love is a beautiful thing, although some circumstances can make it look ugly or inappropriate, it is still love. \nI liked learning things. How numbers worked together to explain the stars. How molecules made the world. All the ugly and wonderful things people had done in the last two thousand years.\nThis story of a young girl who has been poisoned by her mother's words - afraid of touch, to eat. A young girl who has lived and experienced more at 13 then most have at 70. A young girl who falls in love at 8 with a man in his twenties. A friendship is born. These two form a special bond over the years, Kellen becomes the person who looks out for Wavy, he takes care of her. But then everything goes to hell and these two are forced apart. Now this is where my morality took a beating, because I felt I should have been more upset considering the ages of the characters, but I couldn't help rooting for these two. \n\"..he loved that girl. He treated her good, took care of her, made sure she went to school. He looked out for her when nobody else did.\"\nI finished this story a few days ago, and it has stayed with me. It was honestly such a remarkably written story, I hope readers will give it a chance. Personally, I look forward to reading more of Bryn's work in the future.*ARC provided via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "j e w e l s [Books Bejeweled]", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68216634-j-e-w-e-l-s-books-bejeweled", "userReview": "I read this over six months ago and I still think about it all the time. But, I hadn't started writing reviews for a blog or GR back then, so I didn't. But I must. ALL THE UGLY AND WONDERFUL THINGS. The title sums up the book like no other title possible. Everyone knows I love plot twists. I also adore any book that flat out surprises me. I went in blind to this, my bookclub's monthly selection. This book shocked the living hell out of me and evoked emotions and opinions I didn't even know I had!The novel is about a little girl named Wavy, her father is a drug dealer and her mother is a drug addicted, emotionally challenged nightmare. What chance does Wavy have at life? at love? at security? Until she meets the love of her life, Kellen, she's just a feral kitten. Fighting for life, trying to protect her baby brother. It will break your heart. A story of contradictions and it works like a charm. Wavy is too young, Kellen is too old. Wavy is afraid to eat or speak, Kellen is a 300 pound giant with greasy hands and a big noisy motorcycle. Each character in this book is so real, you can't make yourself remember you are reading fiction. It is the impossible beautiful writing by Bryn Greenwood that makes these characters spring to life and then LIVE in your head for months! I read a lot of books, but very few like this. My 2016 FICTION OF THE YEAR award goes to All the Ugly and Wonderful Things."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9916227-jennifer-kyle", "userReview": "4 STARSThis is my first read by this author and I thought it was an extremely well written story. The author gives the feelings of the characters, the facts and situations, masterfully. All the while never manipulating the story or over romanticizing it. For this mother of two daughters the relationship passed lines that should never be crossed and left me outside of my comfort zone. However, I think the author would be just fine hearing that sort of feedback from a reader when releasing this type of story. \n\u201dI do love you,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice rumbling through the floor. \u201cI love you all the way.\u201d Not the sort of thing a family friend says to a thirteen-year-old girl.\u201d\nThis is a love story between a child in elementary school and a grown man in his twenties that buds from friendship. There are mouth kisses as young as nine and orgasms by thirteen years old. Yet, he was her friend and the only one who looked out for her and young brother. I just couldn\u2019t get past the ages even if these two as adults are still in love and are still together in the end. It doesn\u2019t negate overstepping lines that should never be crossed with a minor in the first place.The story starts off in 1975 as a young girl named Wavonna comes to live with her aunt and cousins while her parents are incarcerated. Wavy displays an assortment of disturbing behaviors. The author not only gifts Wavy\u2019s POV but an assortment of POVS throughout the story which only added to the depth and connection to Wazy. Once returned back to the custody of her parents and her new born brother, she finds that things haven\u2019t changed at all. Neglect and mental abuse is all this little girl knows until the day she meets Kellen. \n\u201dWavy\u2019s my responsibility. I take care of her. We take care of each other.\u201d\nThe author pushed the envelope with this story and though it\u2019s a 5 Star for writing and delivery for me, I can\u2019t freely recommend to friends without warning them to read the synopsis and decide for themselves. The relationship should not have crossed the line so young and it\u2019s unconventional and taboo yet brings us to a love blossoming in extenuating circumstances. It\u2019s so very sad that this little girl was raised by parents who\u2019s rights should have been revoked and that so many could have done more to help. Definitely a story to discuss with other readers because I could see some loving these two together while others adamant that it was all wrong. The title perfectly captures this story of love that was found amidst such ugly. **ARC provided by Netgalley in exchange for an honest review**"}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "DNF..............For me this was a case of  Know when to hold'em and know when to fold'em I am certainly not singing with the choir on this one but I have to say how the book affected me regardless.The Description on NetGalley begins with the following\" A beautiful and provocative love story between two unlikely people and the hard-won relationship that elevates them above the Midwestern meth lab backdrop of their lives.Personally I didn't find the relationship between a thirteen year old child and a man as provocative or beautiful, I just felt really uncomfortable the further along the book I read until I came to a point which I thought, Ok this is getting downright ugly and disturbing and I need to dump this one as I felt I was entering into territory that I certainly do not enjoy reading. I feel this is going to be the controversial summer read and there will be many opinions along the way of which mine will just be one.Yep! the writing is good, the characters are well formed but this story just doesn't work for me and no amount of good writing or well formed characters will encourage me to read any further. It took me 7 days to get to 50% in the Novel and I realized I actually hated picking up the book.I need to point out that I am in the minority with my negative review on this book and urge readers to please read many of the other marvellous 5 and 4 star reviews before making a decision whether to read this book or not as my option is only my reaction to the story and people react differently to storylines and subjects.My Thanks to Netgalley for the opportunity to review this copy in return for an honest opinion."}], "description": "As the daughter of a meth dealer, Wavy knows not to trust people, not even her own parents.
