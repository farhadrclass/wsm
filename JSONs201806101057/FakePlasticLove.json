The two first met because Jeremy, M., and Chase (Belle's on and off again college boyfriend) all worked at the same firm. Immediately after meeting Jeremy falls in love with Belle and eventually gets caught up in a love triangle between her and Chase that leads to M. becoming estranged from Belle and Jeremy losing his job. The book is supposed to be some kind of modern Great Gatsby, which I didn't enjoy anyways, but again I feel like maybe the author was patting themselves on the back too much about their own insight and timeliness with the novel. Just because technological changes and financial marketing scandal are mentioned through out in passing doesn't make this book social commentary. Neither does making Belle a blog writer. The ideas about marriage and love felt outdated and Jeremy and Belle's nostalgia for a time they weren't even alive for is quaint at best. There are so many much more relevant themes the author could have talked about than money and the pretense people put up with it, which has been done again and again. How about alienation due to technology? Maybe if the financial crisis actually had any repercussions on any of the characters. I think authors should stick to making their novels stand out on their own merit, setting them up for comparison is just fucking yourself over. It's an okay book but I don't think it's going to have any lasting impact for me. More of a pleasure read I'd reach for when I want to not think too much."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1040650-kate", "userReview": "[blown-away in a hot air balloon (because of course he's a hot air balloonist) potential but unconfirmed fanciful pre-wedding sighting of Jeremy  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Grier Kantor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4965059-grier-kantor", "userReview": "2.5 stars. I really truly disliked the over-stylized way this author writes. It was not at all surprising when I found out she wrote her thesis on the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald because Belle was basically a modern day Daisy Buchanan. Here's the perfect example of how a 26 year old having a conversation with another 26 year old speaks in this book, \"I'm sorry, M., but I feel so fragile that I might faint if I don't consume a rare steak. Could we continue this next door?\" Nope.

This is most certainly a coming of age story. I remember feeling like M. upon my graduation from college, all the promise and hope for my future, yet sadness at leaving behind the safety and stability of school. The choices each of the characters make throughout the novel shape them into the adults we meet at the end. M. and Belle have the quintessential college friendship that continues after graduation. M. meets Jeremy when she and Chase begin working at the prestigious Bartholomew Brother's Investment firm, where they all survive the grueling almost hazing of new employees. Belle and Chase are involved in an on again off again relationship that began in college. Jeremy is the hopeless romantic that believes in love at first sight and that if it's meant to be there will always be a sign. He and Belle share a chance encounter one morning and Jeremy believes Belle is his forever. As M., Chase, and Jeremy embrace the world of investment banking, Belle carves out her own mark through a blog devoted to romance and all things beautiful. Belle sweeps Jeremy off his feet at a work social she has attended with Chase and the two begin dating. M. has a chance encounter with a man standing off from all the action and makes a pointed decision to find out who he is. As these 3 main characters continue to grow their lives are forever shaped and changed by the decisions they make concerning their jobs. Each one gives up a piece of their soul and something they love and care about for their jobs. Throughout the story I found myself rooting for Jeremy, the \"underdog\" so to speak due to his romantic nature. While I never wanted him to actually end up with Belle, I wanted him to be happy. I am kind of saddened at how in the end things are left concerning Jeremy.Like the characters in this book we sacrifice things we love for things that aren't as important in the long run. We allow our jobs and other responsibilities to get in the way of our relationships with family, friends, and spouses. People do things for all the wrong reasons, such as getting married to someone or staying at a job they hate, creating a glamorous world in their mind that doesn't exist in reality in order to survive, as Belle did with her blog, thus creating a world of Fake Plastic Love. Sadly, I am no exception to this. I have allowed a job I did love to take over my life and in the end make me miserable and yet I still wasn't ready to up and walk away. Like M. I wasn't sure what I wanted, and was therefore, afraid to give up what I had. This book reminds us it is up to us to decide what want our lives to add up to."}, {"userName": "Sam (AMNReader)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67310619-sam-amnreader", "userReview": "DNF 25% Well, my feelings on this book have reached a point of clarity. I have a lot of fiction to read-and not enough time. I spent a lot of time deciding this book would land solidly in the DNF category. Perhaps you are intrigued by it, perhaps I can save you the time. Kimberley Tait shows promise, but I never felt immersed in the story or characters.So, The Great Gatsby remains one of my favorite books for Fitzgerald's writing, his sense of characterization, and capturing a time and place (c'mon \"the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star\" <3. This book was intended as a not-so-secret nod. I would never complain about that. But I will complain about the heavy-handed references (browsing Fitzgerald, 20s parties/hangouts, shoot, I think Belle even had daisies in her bike basked). We get it Miss Tait, you don't want us to miss your model for your novel. however, I'm just growing insulted. The characters are hopelessly self-involved (forgivable) and one-dimensional (unforgivable). Belle doesn't come across as flighty or dreamy, but purely calculated in her image to appeal. Jeremy had some little boy appeal but seemed to lack the sense of confidence. And though I did not read through to determine how heavily the characters were based on the original, I did note that M. was no Nick-whose fondness for his friends shone through his narration. M. struck me as righteous and superior. But she's Kimberly Tait, not F. Scott Fitzgerald so it's not even that...Or maybe it's just all of it. It was a failure of execution, and to be honest, my expectations weren't that high. Yes, I only read 25%, but it was enough to know the prose was purple (and you have to go a L O N G way for me to say that given my favorite authors are all considered such by those who like a more parsimonious use of language), the characters boring in their one-dimensionality, and the setting of time and place was not striking enough to feel like it would be used as anything other than a cheap device for conflict.I hope Kimberley Tait publishes again, because I will certainly attempt a second novel."}, {"userName": "Kendra", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3259210-kendra", "userReview": "I did receive this book free from goodreads.

This is a modern day story set in millennial New York featuring M., Belle, Jeremy, Chase and Scott. M. and Belle were college best friends and moved to New York following graduation. What transpires next is an exploration of self, life, and the search for the answer to the ever important question \"You will be a grand total of what you spend your time doing, so what do you want to add up to?\"While this book is set in modern day, it has such a feel of nostalgia, not only in the writing but also by featuring the \"Romantics\" who still love things such as gramophones, jazz, and dressing properly. The writing is beautiful and flowing and has the feel of reading an old classic. The book definitely tips its hat to F. Scott Fitzgerald and can even be said to be a Gatsby reimagining (a definite bonus). The characters were well developed and \"real\", which always make me feel connected to the story. But even more than that, the writing was magical and transported me to another world. I was memorized throughout this book and didn't want it to end.

Kimberley Tait captivated me from the start with her artfully polished and elegant writing style that harkens to a bygone era and catapults it forward into a modern-day setting. Her words sparkled into a vibrant, celebratory toast to individual ideals and truths too often muddled or masked by the blares and blasts of a 24/7 digital world. I found the writing to be heartfelt and earnest, almost as if the spirited beauty, strength and wit of Katharine Hepburn could be converted into words on paper. As the story unfolded, I found hints of my own twentysomething self in her characters, and I found myself wanting to pour myself a Pink Gin cocktail from Belle\u2019s bamboo bar cart, rewind time and recapture some of the untarnished brilliance and innocence of youth skipping and winding through college lawns and the streets of New York that the author depicts so well. \u201cFrom that loftiest perch the city\u2019s grid really was remarkable\u2013with streets and lives and loves lost and found linking together and laid out as a network of silver piping.\u201d (I must also applaud the clever and astute observations of often-baffling Corporate America from a female perspective that are oh so amusingly threaded into the storyline!) Throughout my read, I found myself wistfully lost in the dreaminess of the song-like qualities of the writing and the characters themselves--so much so that when I reached the final pages of the final chapter, I experienced the similarly heart-shattering pang of emotion I feel the night before the last day of a perfect vacation--I didn\u2019t want it to end.

Today I have to back off that belief because I just read a book that I really liked, but with writing that often bothered me. It\u2019s Fake Plastic Love, the debut novel from Kimberley Tait. Ostensibly, it\u2019s about four new adult, millennial friends taking Manhattan by storm. The narrator, M, and two friends, Belle and Chase have all graduated from Dartmouth. M and Chase meet Jeremy at the investment bank where they are fortunate enough to secure highly coveted jobs in the financial dog days of 2009. Belle writes a charming lifestyle blog about all the fabulous and romantic things you can do in NYC when money is no object and you don\u2019t have a day job.

I normally don't like reading about people working in or involved with the financial industry in some way, but the main character, M., wasn't too frustrating to read about. There is also some beautiful writing in here that seems very truthful to me, in a way I can't really describe well. The book also at times felt like it talking about a whole different world or time, which to me felt more fun than unrealistic. Although M. wasn't too frustrating of a main character, I did at times find myself wondering \"Why?\" when she made some of her choices or took some course of action: Why Belle? Why the bank?...

Count me among the pleasantly surprised.At its core, the story in Fake Plastic Love unravels as a cautionary tale of two college friends who follow their respective paths. M. and Belle become acquainted at Dartmouth and an unlikely friendship begins. M. is a level headed and focused student whose path takes her to Wall Street; Belle is basically a debutante whose Hello Kitty handbags and sunny disposition put her on track to land an Mrs. degree at Dartmouth (and not a lot more) en route to becoming a trophy wife...Both veer away from expectations after college, and are surprisingly drawn to the same man in New York City. Jeremy is from a by-gone era. He works with M. but wears his heart on his sleeve (which attracts Belle). Jeremy and Belle become an item and that is really where fissures begin to show in the friendships of M. and Jeremy and also of M. and Belle. It is surprising how much time - somewhere in there four years or more pass with nary a word -gets away from you as a reader of the story. Should M. really have followed her job \"across the pond\"? Does Belle want things for herself or want them for her blog followers? What is real and what is expected of either of them? Does any one care what is happening to Jeremy (and was Jeremy the real star of the blog La Belle Vie)?I felt that Scott was really the only adult in the whole book and I appreciated his honesty (and his website idea). He also had the best hard and fast rules about sticking to what he wanted and being true to himself.Setting the book to start on the morning of M.'s wedding was a good choice.

Great job in creating a \"false\" or \"plastic\" sense of romance regarding lifestyles that contrast with more reality/common sense approach to life. Good descriptions of office work environment vs. the breeziness (or even facade?) of Bella's life style blog. The implications of starry eyed love with the reality of finances, promises, and use of New York City as a playground were all woven well into the main message. Like how the novel begins and ends with the same event. Thought the dialogue was well done as well as the friendship of M and Bella. It was fun that it was finally reveled what M's proper name is, too. Cons: When M moves to London for work, she runs into two friends on two separate occasions. Am willing to believe that it would happen at least once, which actually furthered the plot. The second run in was too much of a stretch, especially, in my opinion, it wasn't relevant to the plot.
