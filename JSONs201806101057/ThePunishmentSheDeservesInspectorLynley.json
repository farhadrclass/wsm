When he turns up dead while in police custody due to an accusation of pedophilia, it\u2019s up to Detective Chief Superintendent Isabelle Ardery to sort out whether it was suicide or murder. She reluctantly teams up with DS Barbara Havers and they set off to historic Ludlow to investigate. Ardery is battling more demons than a possible murderer. She\u2019s fighting with her ex-husband who is determined to move out of the country with their two sons and Ardery\u2019s been hitting the vodka bottle too often. She\u2019s also determined to finally find enough reason to call for the transfer of Havers out of her district.I\u2019ve have been a fan of this author since her first book many years ago. Ms. George is a master at meticulously plotting out her complex mysteries, but where she truly excels is in her characters. If you decide to read something by this author, and I hope you do, you should start with her first book, \u201cA Great Deliverance\u201d, so you have a good understanding of the background of each of the characters and can grow to love them as I have. Her newest book is a long one, over 700 pages on my Kindle, but you\u2019ll get no complaints about that from me as the more time I spend with these characters, the happier I am. This is a complex tale and one of the best that this author has written. I became totally engrossed in the mystery and I so very much enjoyed Ms. George\u2019s humorous telling of Havers\u2019 attempts at tap dancing. Ms. George remains my favorite English mystery writer (though she\u2019s American). I\u2019m already longing for her next book.Most highly recommendedThis book was given to me by the publisher in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Chris Conley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7209420-chris-conley", "userReview": "Heavenly days!!! Elizabeth George is amazing. This book looked daunting when I got it as it is 690 pages!!! I wanted to feel that she could have told the story in half that but, of course, she couldn\u2019t.

I used it for upper arm workouts during breaks from reading. There is an interminable quantity of uninteresting storyline here involving binge-drinking college students, screwing and blowjobbing college students, and an Anglo-Indian family falling apart. The Isabelle Ardery thread was surprisingly welcome. We hate her because she is a termagant and has a sexual past with Lynley, and our hatred is nudged along here by her uncontrollable drunkenness. Every time she thinks about reaching for the airline vodka bottle, pulls her hand away, and then reaches for it again and downs it, readers will cheer. We won't be happy until she is finally destroyed.Something interesting happens to Lynley, in that George makes his aristocraticness the cause of his good character and virtues. He is so well-bred that it has become impossible for him to do wrong. The book does in fact end with a scene in which Lynley bullies Havers, but this is portrayed as doing her a favor."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "When a Member of Parliament shows up at New Scotland Yard requesting an investigation into the suicide of the son of one of his constituents in the beautiful town of Ludlow, the Assistant Commissioner sees two opportunities in this request: the first is to have an MP owing him a favour, and the second is to get rid of Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, whose career at the Met has been hanging by a thread for quite some time.Another good plot with Inspector Lynley and Sgt Barbara Havers acting in another good detective story.4* A Great Deliverance (Inspector Lynley, #1) 5* Payment in Blood (Inspector Lynley, #2) 4* Well-Schooled in Murder (Inspector Lynley, #3) 5* A Suitable Vengeance (Inspector Lynley, #4) 5* For the Sake of Elena (Inspector Lynley, #5) 4* Missing Joseph (Inspector Lynley, #6) 4* Playing for the Ashes (Inspector Lynley, #7) 4* In the Presence of the Enemy (Inspector Lynley, #8) 4* Deception on His Mind (Inspector Lynley, #9) 4* In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner (Inspector Lynley, #10) 4* A Traitor to Memory (Inspector Lynley, #11) 4* A Place of Hiding (Inspector Lynley, #12) 4* With No One as Witness (Inspector Lynley, #13) 4* What Came Before He Shot Her (Inspector Lynley, #14) 3* Careless in Red (Inspector Lynley, #15) 4* This Body of Death (Inspector Lynley, #16) 4* Believing the Lie (Inspector Lynley, #17) 3.5* Just One Evil Act (Inspector Lynley, #18)3* A Banquet of Consequences (Inspector Lynley, #19) 4 * The Punishement She Deserves (Inspector Lynley, #20)"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1369501-lisa", "userReview": "A multilayered, well-plotted mystery with a bunch of characters \u2014 trust the author, it all ties together in the end.

There are many possibilities. First, the irrepressible, insubordinate, ill-kempt, Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, who is my favorite character in the whole series for her colorful way of saying off-color things, brilliant instincts, and believable background. Barbara has managed to piss off many of her superiors at Scotland Yard, and at the beginning of the book she is sent off to Shropshire on an investigation with Detective Chief Superintendent Isabelle Ardery, her arch-nemesis. The assignment has been designed as an opportunity for her to screw up, and be appropriately punished by exile to the far north.Or the \"she\" could be Isabelle Ardery herself, whom we have come to dislike in the previous novel, A Banquet of Consequences, for the way she lords it over Barbara's immediate boss, Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley, whom she outranks only because she now occupies the administrative position that he refused. But very early in this new novel, Ardery reveals herself to have a problem with alcohol, and before long she is behaving worse than ever. I might have said that some of her scenes are bit too melodramatic to be believable, but then alcoholics can indeed behave in quite abnormal ways.One of the many ways in which Isabelle has failed is as a mother. Her divorced husband is about to move with their two sons to New Zealand, a decision she is fighting tooth and nail. But there are at least two other mothers in the book who, by having too little faith in their children, are in serious danger of ruining their lives. Any one of them could be the \"she\" in the title. It is one of the themes that tie the book together as more than merely another whodunnit.Finally, the \"she\" could be one of the handful of college-age girls in the town of Ludlow, where most of the action is set. Students at West Mercia College, we see them mostly either binge drinking, having promiscuous sex, or attempting to cope with the consequences of either \u2014 suffering punishments that are largely of their own making. The novel opens with two such girls going to an end-of-term celebration in a local pub, a situation that ends with them having to be carted away by the local Police Community Support Officer, who is all that is left to keep order in Ludlow after deep cutbacks in the regular force.For a long time, the relevance of these first two dozen pages is not clear; the case that brings Scotland Yard to Ludlow is the suicide in custody of a Church of England deacon, an accused pedophile. Isabelle and Barbara go there to report on the soundness of the original investigation, and their inquiry occupies most of the next 200 pages. But they return and, for reasons I shall not disclose,* Barbara is sent out again, this time with her own boss, DI Lynley. There are almost 500 pages still to go. In them, George will spend as much time or more on other characters as she does with the detectives. It is an unusual approach. Rather than discovering information solely through the police investigation, the reader is invited to share the thoughts and lives of a couple of dozen other characters, who may be bystanders, suspects, victims, officers of the law, or sometimes several of these at once.For the last two or three books of hers that I have read, I have felt that Elizabeth George was no longer a mystery writer, but a novelist who uses mystery as a means of prying open many other aspects of everyday life. Hence the importance of recurrent themes such as motherhood, substance abuse, failing marriages, and coming of age, that knit the book together as a true novel, rather than merely serving as clues to a solution. I find the mixture utterly engaging, especially since the American George now has no need to prove she can write a British mystery as well as any Brit, and since what I call the \"series story\" \u2014 the romantic lives of Lynley, Havers, and others \u2014 is allowed to take a back seat.All the same, I did not like this one quite as much as the last. One reason is that the lives of all these teenagers \u2014 Dena, Missa, Francie, Chelsea, Finn, and Brutus \u2014 is so far from my own now, and often so squalid, that I had a hard time caring about them as much as some of the older characters. Another is that I found it difficult to understand the mission of the Met's first trip to London. Isabelle insists that it is not to investigate the deacon's death, or the justification for his arrest in the first place, though Barbara keeps blundering into the no-go area; it is quite a relief when, on her trip with Lynley, it becomes more like a normal investigation. And the reason for there even being a second trip at all hangs on a question of chronology that seems to be a matter of sloppy plotting on George's part.* Perhaps I also felt that George was a little perfunctory in tying up some of her many subplots \u2014 not the mysteries, which were admirably solved, but some novel aspects such as the rehabilitation of the various problem characters, which seemed a trifle too optimistic. But this could also be a compliment to her ability to create such characters in the first place, and take them into emotional areas far beyond the range of a more normal genre offering.======In her acknowledgements, George remarks that she likes to research a particular part of England in which to set each novel. She used Somerset for her previous book; this time, she moves north, to Ludlow in Shropshire, the bracing hills and smaller villages around, and the cathedral cities of the west country. And she is very good in evoking her setting. I was at school in Shropshire sixty years ago, and revisited the area a decade ago. It took me back to my last trip to that region, when I took the photos of Ludlow below:*See my first comment, which I have posted as a spoiler."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7342090-sandra", "userReview": "Please note: I read this as a free e-ARC from Netgalley. As I wasn\u2019t too enamored with Elizabeth George\u2019s last two Lynsey novels, I started this one with trepidation. However, I should not have been concerned. I really felt like this one was one of her best installments. As it begins, Ardury and Havers are sent to Ludlow to follow up on an suicide investigation. Due to Ardury\u2019s increasing alcohol dependency clues are missed and not followed up. Barbara Havers is tasked in writing the report only to be conflicted of writing the report fully truthful or the truth that Ardury requires. From there, Lynley becomes involved and both Havers and Lynley are dispatched back to Ludlow for a full investigation. Definitely not one to be missed."}, {"userName": "Tanja Berg", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg", "userReview": "I have a long history with Elizabeth George. She is one of just two authors that I read in my teens that I still read - the other being Stephen King. The very first book I read, when I was a anxiety and zit ridden teen, was \"For the Sake of Elena\". I was 16 years old or so, and had been reading adult fiction for just a couple of years. That book held a wealth of codes into the grown up world. It also had a Swedish professor who swore in his native tongue (my native tongue), which was fascinating as far away from my Nordic ancestors as I was (I was attending high school in Asia). The book also featured a rat called \"Tidbit\". I eventually got rats as pets myself, talk about influence!Twelve years later, 2005, I was reading \"With no one as witness\". I had spent a week with my pregnant sister and brother in-law on a remote island on the West Coast of Norway, with the vastness of the Atlantic just outside. My sister and her husband had just left, and the rented cottage - a house with five bedrooms - felt desolate. Toward the end of this book inspector Lynley loses his pregnant wife in a senseless act of violence. I think I bawled for the entire day. I have not cried with any fictional character as much as Lynley, because his loss intertwined with my own into sheer, bottomless misery.Thus I have high expectations and greatly look forward to a new Lynley novel by Elizabeth George. I admire her craft and I care deeply about her main characters. Despite all this, and for knowing DCC Isabelle, Inspector Lynley and sergeant Havers so well, this was a slow burn. The author weaves a tale in such a way that I had no idea as to the perpetrator or motive - or even if there had even been a murder - for about half the book. Isabelle Aredery and Barbara Havers looking into how a suspect could die - apparently suicide - in an unmanned police station is fascinating in its personal dynamics. Isabelle hates Barbara for her insubordination from the last book. Barbara can do nothing to stand up for herself, so she doesn't, but goes her own way anyway. This in the end, nearly gets her fired, but for Lynley - of course. Isabelle is ridden by her own demons of course - she is badly alcoholic and her ex husband is taking their sons to New Zealand. In many ways this book takes a look at addiction. How it starts, and how it ruins lives. The side characters are binge drinking college students. The sheer amount of personal detail and the incredibly well crafted story lands the rating on a 4*, although I thought a star lower for most of the book based on my enjoyment. There are few crime writer equal to Elizabeth George though and although this is a slow burn, there is still a wealth of fascinating detail. You can read this a stand alone, but you shouldn't. This works much better if you have the history of the characters from previous installments."}, {"userName": "Stephanie ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1007476-stephanie", "userReview": "It has been too long since I read/reviewed an Elizabeth George Novel (since August, 2015, in fact, with the release of A Banquet of Consequences). Some things don\u2019t change: as I said then, \u201cI LOVE Elizabeth George, and have been reading the Inspector Lynley novels (or, as I prefer to call them, the Lynley-Havers novels) since the mid-1990s when introduced to them by a fellow librarian when we were stuck in an airport.\u201dFor those familiar with the series, I\u2019ll start with a couple of things I hoped for back in 2015, and which I was still hoping as 2018 arrived: One of them involved Barbara\u2019s neighbors, the Azhars, Taymullah and Haddiyah, who \u201c\u2026had fled to Pakistan, and I admit I was hoping for an update on this whole complex relationship.\u201d And, also in 2015: \u201cFamiliar characters appear, including Winston Nkata, Isabelle Ardery (Lynley\u2019s former lover and current boss to both him and Detective Sergeant Havers), Daidre the veterinarian who seemed to be a likely candidate to bring Lynley out of his ongoing mourning following his wife\u2019s murder a couple of books ago\u2026like getting an update on old friends.\u201dNeither of those sub-plotlines was addressed in Banquet, but I continued to hold out hope as I received \u201cThe Punishment She Deserved,\u201d (thanks to Penguin Group VIKING and NetGalley).As the story begins, Barbara Havers is in deep poop as she is partnered with Isabelle Ardery. They are sent to Ludlow, a small historic village that has been rocked by the death of the local deacon. It looks like suicide, but there are rumors of pedophilia, which has the deacon\u2019s father outraged to the point of complaining to his local member of Parliament \u2013 so of course Scotland Yard is brought in and the two women are assigned to review the work done by the local police when they investigated the man\u2019s unexpected death. Isabelle wants to just do a cursory review and get the hell out of Ludlow, back to her demons and personal problems surrounding her ex-husband and their two sons. But Barbara can\u2019t ignore the things that she sees: they just nag at her, and she tries to pursue every lead she can despite Isabelle ordering her to just review the prior report, and don\u2019t open any cans of worms. Anyone familiar with Barbara knows this is not bloody likely! As usual, George introduces characters in such a way that we quickly feel we KNOW them. For example, Finn Freeman, a young man around whom much of the facts seem to revolve, \u201c\u2026wasn\u2019t a picture either. His clothes\u2026favored excessively tattered jeans and an extremely threadbare flannel shirt. He wore sandals\u2026but his black-apainted toenails did not delight. On his reight anjle was a piece of braided leather, and a bulbous know of the same material formed an earring tht looked like an excrescence on hius left lobe. He actually might not have been a bad looking young man, but taken as a whole, he was something that might have been created by Munch.\u201dAnd I love the description of the Underground station: the\u2026\u201d crowd in the underground\u2026ignored one another as per usual, jostling about like kittens struggling for a nursing position while also attempting to text, read their newspapers, listen to\u2026music via earbuds\u2026\u201dAnd her language used for various characters is incredibly revelatory as to their nature. For example, Thomas Lynley (aka Lord Asherton) gets out of his car and looks across the street: \u201c\u2026the banner announcing Titus Andronicus had lettering in which the uppercase letters both transformed into pools of blood beneath them. At least the audience would be forewarned, he thought.\u201d PERFECT!By contrast, Trevor Freeman, owner of a local fitness center and husband of a Clover Freeman, a local high-ranking policewoman, is involved in a debate with her, and might have prevailed \u201c\u2026had he managed to keep his bloody wits about him, but he kept getting sidelined by his dick.\u201dThe plot is good (especially once Lynley is on the scene, working with Havers), and her language manages to make me learn without making me feel stupid: \u201c\u2026his demands\u2026became as furious as they were adamantine.\u201d (yay! A new word!) There are also typical Britishisms, such as chuffed (opposite meaning to what I suspected) and weir. And, there are several uses of words for which I THOUGHT I knew the meaning, but learned I was wrong (or ignorant of the specific use in this book): scourge, grass and caravan all had meaning different from what generally think when I encounter them. Alongside the language and characterization, there is the excellent police procedural and complex plotting: as Clover tells Trevor, \u201cThe truth never means a thing. When it comes to innocence or guilt, the trut is the first casualty in an investigation.\u201d Because much of the plot turns on the inadequate police staffing in small towns (based on reality in the U.K. these days), we see a clear contrast between the methods of Scotland Yard and those of the local police, somewhat beleaguered by the reductions in staff.Overall, a very satisfying read. SPOILER AHEAD: I am, however, still waiting for the advancement of the subplots mentioned at the start of this review. Nonetheless, five stars."}, {"userName": "Jaksen", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7233842-jaksen", "userReview": "I won this book in a Goodreads Giveaway. Thank you, Goodreads!Kind of a big messy book with lots going on, lots of characters with lots of dialogue and interaction, which is why the book is almost 700 pages, I suppose.In this one, Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, she of the unkempt look but the wise-beyond-her-appearance brain, is sent with Chief Inspector Isabelle Ardrey to investigate an investigation. Yes, seriously, they are sent to make sure a police investigation into a suicide was done properly, all the 'i's dotted, all the 't's written so you can tell an 'i' from a 't,' and so on. Of course, Havers finds all sorts of suspect things going on, which Ardrey wants to simply tuck under the rug and forget about. (Isabelle is also dealing with a very, very serious drinking problem in this book, one she continually makes excuses for and tries to hide. Also, she's got problems with her ex. This situation takes up a good chunk of the book, but it's an important part of the plot.) Anyhow, unless it impinges on the previous, local investigation - which ascertained Mr. Ian Druitt, church deacon recently accused of pedophilia, committed suicide while in police custody - then, for Isabelle, it's largely irrelevant. Isabelle Ardery is a firm 'color within the lines' type person, and of course, a former lover of Havers' oft-time partner, the suave and highly intelligent Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley. It helps to read this series in order. There are a ton of characters, rich character development and themes which run from book to book. I stopped reading the series early on, but even picking up this book - which I won - I recognized many of the important players from the first six or seven books. At any rate, due to Lynley's subtle intervention - when Havers reports to him her misgivings about the original investigation into the suicide - he and Havers are ordered to re-investigate the entire situation: was it suicide? Or was it murder?This is the kind of book where things are hidden from the reader, in that sometimes a character - whose head you are in - knows something or does something, but the reader isn't told what it is. This isn't my fav. way to write a mystery. If Character X knows this or that and we're in Character X's POV, why aren't we told about this or that? But we often aren't, anyhow...Four stars, if just for complexity and the fact we get to read about Lynely and Havers.

Still, I've missed quite a few of these, and now it looks as if I'll have to find the one where Lynley and Havers go to Italy, since that promises to figure in the next novel. As for this one, it's long, very long. 700 pages in hardcover. But oddly enough, I really didn't mind and I enjoyed reading the whole thing, even if I wasn't tearing through it like a thriller. I liked reading it for an hour or so a day over the space of a week. The mystery is a good one and I never twigged to which bloke was the culprit. You see what I did there -- Elizabeth George, who is an American, makes sure all the characters sound super British. No one ever \"gets\" something, they always \"fetch\" it, if someone addresses more than one person, it's always \"you lot,\" and people are endlessly \"twigging,\" \"chuffed to bits,\" and so on. No one sounds as British as Elizabeth George, not Ruth Rendell or Agatha Christie or Tana French, no one. If there's a theme in The Punishment She Deserves, it's bad parenting, especially bad mothers. Evil Stepmothers are nothing compared to mothers who mean well but get it spectacularly wrong.

I had high hopes for the return of the earlier relationship and mystery solving of this beloved duo. This came quite close but got bogged down with the numerous detailed side stories. The beginning takes almost 200 of its 700 pages to put Lynley and Havers back as a team on a very involved murder as we first have to watch DCS Ardery crucify Havers ONE more time. I get tired of the story line that DS Havers, one of many officers of Scotland Yard is continually the focus of her superiors and plotted against to remove or transfer. Surely they all have better things to do! She has been years on the force and has a serious track record of solving some of their most baffling cases with Lynley.Once our duo is on the case the story moves along at a faster pace and far more enjoyable as they do their magic, working together meshing their strengths and weaknesses to investigate the complex crime. Her earlier books were detailed and longer than most but this one seems to drag on quite a few of the side stories of the other characters involved. I did enjoy, as always, Ms. George style of writing as well as her plot.

How the various amount of girls & boys and their relatives try to cope with life. An hard time life, let me say. Everyone carrying a burden of sins that are passing from the past of mothers & fathers to daughters & sons. It seems a lot intricate also for a George's novel. Everyone hiding a piece of truth, everyone lying or trying to deceive our detectives.

Havers is so cooperative that after an hundred pages we're thinking she will blast the DC. But she can deal with it, and she got the reward of 500 pages of a lovely collaboration with Tommy (quite too much lovely, indeed. Never an argument or a try to do evil.

Normally, she is the one to rip me from a reading slump with a riveting chunkster in the Lynley series. This simply wasn't the case here, but it in no way means I'm giving up Elizabeth George. I'll just be patiently waiting for the next in the series, and will like usual be one of the first in line to buy. The mystery Havers and at first, DCS Isabelle Ardery, are sent out to investigate is weaker and possibly, sillier, than what George usually provides. After Ardery falls hard off the wagon, Lynley is sent in to back up Havers on getting to the bottom of the originally deemed suicide of a local deacon in a small town outside of London. What follows is a tale of college students, binge drinking and blow jobs (a whole lot of blow jobs friends. * eye rolls *) Piecing together this mystery wasn't too difficult either and overall seemed like George had difficulty carrying this plot through to the end - the college students and various other characters seemed to get away from her this time around, and in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/529705-beverly", "userReview": "There is a compactness to this story which starts out low key and slowly gathers intensity.

Some 690 pages, but it actually does read fairly fast. And also, as with other Elizabeth George books, this one causes the reader to do a lot of soul-searching, and it made me shake my head at how \"spot-on\" she is with her characterizations. She made me contemplate just how far some people will go to protect their child. She made me read in amazement at how she portrayed an alcoholic's downward spiral. She made me realize just how real all her characters are, but especially Lynley, and most especially, Barbara Havers. Barbara and Lynley are in the small college town of Ludlow. A suicide has occurred in custody in that town, and the man who was found dead in the police station was a deacon of the local church. His father is determined that his son did not commit suicide, so through his MLA and his lawyer he has tasked the Met to determine what really happened. At first go, when Havers is there with the impeccable DCS Ardery, and as the animosity between these two is well-known and palpable, Barbara finds she can't strike out on her own to get to the bottom of things. She knows that something is definitely not right, but is thwarted at every turn when she tries to follow yet another lead. As it turns out, the first investigation is overturned and she is sent back to Ludlow with Lynley, and once there, they uncover secret after secret, and lie after lie. Underneath the quiet exterior of Ludlow there has been rape, sodomy, murder, police corruption and evidence tampering going on for months. it's a deep and complex story about small-town life that you will not soon forget. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "William Horn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56014509-william-horn", "userReview": "I've read all the Inspector Lynley books and sadly I have to say this will probably be the last. I've been tempted to give up on the series a couple of times recently but this one has pushed me over the edge. Barbara Havers is one of the best characters I've run across in any mystery series. The level of angst Ms. George created around her became almost intolerable a couple of times in recent books, but I stuck with both the character and the author because... well, because the writing is so darned good. And actually The Punishment She Deserves tones Havers' angst down a little. Unfortunately it jacks up the angst around Isabelle Ardery to a degree I found intolerable - and totally unnecessary for purposes of this book or the series.But what really puts me off about The Punishment She Deserves is the two subplots which seem primarily intended to teach the evils of premarital sex. They both center around unbelievably domineering mothers, milquetoast fathers and horrible punishment for various immoral behaviors. Ms. George's books have always been lengthy but it's never bothered me since they're so well written and researched. For the first time, I felt that this book would have been improved by editing a couple of hundred pages out of it.I'll miss Lynley and Havers. In fact I may miss them so much that I'll break down and buy the next book (assuming there are more), but I'm afraid I won't feel good about it if I do."}, {"userName": "BOOKLOVER10", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47483579-booklover10", "userReview": "Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers work well together, although they are vastly different in appearance and behavior. Havers is unkempt, impulsive, and laces her speech with off-color remarks. Lynley, on the other hand, is immaculately attired, urbane, and dignified. Despite their dissimilarities, Lynley and Havers have a great deal in common. Both are insightful, thorough, and more interested in attaining justice than in kowtowing to their superiors.Lynley is largely absent at the beginning of Elizabeth George's \"The Punishment She Deserves.\" An unhappy Havers is forced to take a wretched road trip out of London with her nemesis, Detective Chief Superintendent Isabelle Ardery. DCS Ardery has contempt for Havers, whom she hopes to transfer to a remote outpost as a punishment for Barbara's impudence and disobedience. Ardery and Havers arrive in the town of Ludlow to determine whether members of local law enforcement mishandled the investigation into the alleged suicide of Deacon Ian Druitt, a much beloved clergyman and humanitarian. Clive Druitt, Gerald's well-connected and wealthy father, is putting pressure on New Scotland Yard to reopen the case and find out what really happened to his son.This novel is a whopping six-hundred-and ninety pages, far longer than it needs to be. The characters include a delusional alcoholic; a community support officer who keeps a close eye on Ludlow's citizenry; two mothers obsessed with micromanaging the lives of their grown children; and a group of self-destructive, hard-drinking, and promiscuous college-age kids. Although the writing is serviceable, the author, who is American, is too eager to show off her command of British slang and idioms. (One irritant is her use of the words \"full stop\" at least a dozen times.) There is a bit of gentle humor provided by Barbara Havers who, in spite of having two left feet, is pushed by a colleague into taking tap dancing lessons. Those who have admired Lynley and Havers for years will want to read \"The Punishment She Deserves,\" but not everyone will be mesmerized by this heavy-handed and awkwardly constructed tale of deceit, family dysfunction, corruption, and sexual exploitation."}, {"userName": "Julia Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2052230-julia-wilson", "userReview": "I enjoy the company of the dapper Inspector Thomas Lynley and the slightly irreverent Barbara Havers but I think 690 pages was a little too long.

The reason for this, I believe, has nothing to do with the superb writing or plot which is always of such a high standard. Rather, it was the sense of absence around the primary character and the man we\u2019ve all grown to know and love, Inspector Thomas Lynley, the intrepid Earl himself. I recall writing one review which was akin to Missing Person\u2019s Report, so strongly did I feel he wasn\u2019t present \u2013 bodily, yes, but it was as if he\u2019d lost his mojo (understandable to a degree in light of his wife\u2019s tragic death, but it was beyond that) and common sense. Fortunately, Havers was there to compensate and that she did \u2013 pop tarts and all. With this novel The Punishment She Deserves, I was at first worried this was going to be yet another book where the reader was deprived of Lynley. While he hovers in the background for the first third, there is a good reason for that. Havers (who is on her last legs in terms of remaining with New Scotland Yard) and Detective Chief Superintendent Ardery \u2013 Lynely\u2019s erstwhile lover and boss as well as an alcoholic \u2013 are sent to the small, ancient town of Ludlow to investigate the apparent suicide of an MP\u2019s son \u2013 Ian Druitt, the local Deacon - who killed himself in a police cell after his arrest on a charge of paedophilia. Regarding this as a perfect opportunity to wipe his hands of Havers once and for all, the Assistant Commissioner sends Ardery and Havers to Ludlow to insure the investigation into the death of Druitt ticked all boxes, as the MP is grumbling from on high and threatening to bring down all sorts of trouble on the force. Ardery is not only tasked with running the investigation, but seeing to it that Havers fails. Warned by Lynley what\u2019s in store, Havers is careful to toe the line\u2026 only, it\u2019s not exactly a line she finds, but a series of curves and ellipses which prick her instincts and tell her all is not as it seems. When Ardery refuses to listen to Havers\u2019 concerns, going so far as to order her to falsify information, Havers is in a bind. Turning to her boss and partner, what she doesn\u2019t expect is for him to risk his reputation and career on her behalf. Lynley\u2019s actions see him taking over the reins of the investigation and, as a reader, it was lovely to find him - from that moment on - both very much present and accounted for.Sent back to Ludlow to properly investigate not only that the police involved behaved appropriately, but that the entire inquiry into the death was carried out as it should have been. Moving slowly, Lynley and Havers\u2019 investigation centres on the close-knit town folk, the families associated with the almost saintly Ian Druitt and the tightly held secrets they all guard. Trying to discover what led Ian Druitt, a man recently awarded by the town, to commit suicide proves more difficult than either Lynley or Havers counted on \u2013 that is, until they understand the man didn\u2019t kill himself and it appears his murder covered up more than one terrible crime\u2026Beautifully written, this story unfurls in a steady, nail-biting way. I don\u2019t want to say too much more for fear of spoiling what is an incredible novel about a crime, but also about family and how it can function (or not) in the best and worst of ways, demand of us obligations and sacrifices with so few rewards. How, despite this, we fight for our loved ones, those who share our blood, for perhaps what this promises rather than the reality. All the characters are so richly drawn that while some of their actions and reasons for them are perplexing and frustrating, you champion and/or see the root of their decisions, even if they inevitably lead to disaster. You also learn the motivation behind the lies, deceptions and oft-misplaced loyalties of family, colleagues, friends, neighbours. There were times I wondered why George spent so much time unravelling a particular family dynamic or a friendship until, as the book progressed and the plot thickened and twisted and turned inside out, I began to not only understand, but become engrossed/horrified/gratified in the ties that bind, blind and seek us to make good or poor decisions as well as deadly ones. What I really enjoyed about this novel as well (apart from seeing Lynley and Havers together and in such fine form again), was exploring what makes Isabelle Ardery tick. I have found her character such a struggle in the past. I never understood Lynley\u2019s attraction to her and what ultimately drew him to sleep with her, nor the respect and position of authority she was given \u2013 her rank didn\u2019t fit the persona we were presented with. I thought after the last book we were well rid of her and was grateful. This isn\u2019t the case. Yet, Ardery\u2019s incentives, her demons, her personal life are all explored and given depth and insights that make you not necessarily like the woman (she is her own worst enemy in that regard and hey, she has it in for Havers and no-one but no-one is allowed to give Barbara an undeserved hard time), but come to understand and even, dare I say, empathise with her and the stupid, reckless decisions she\u2019s made and continues to make as well. George is a master when it comes to untangling the seamier side of human nature, exploring the darkness within and how we\u2019re slaves to this even while we try to resist. She\u2019s proven this over and over in her books and this one is no exception.A rather long book, I nevertheless didn\u2019t want it to end. Masterful, compelling, tightly and expertly plotted with bursts of humour, all expressed with exquisite prose, this is George at her best \u2013 Lynley and Havers too. My only disappointment is that I know I will have a long wait until the next one!"}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie", "userReview": "This was my introduction to the Lynley series, and overall I really enjoyed it because of the characters and their development. It was well-written, and rather glories in using Britishisms in the dialogue, which I loved. It's very good. But I can't get over the feeling at the end that there was an awful lot of Bad Mommy Disease going around the book, and the message seemed to be that ambitious career women make bad mommies. There's hope for them to change, but the density of bad mother characters felt a little uncomfortable for me. If I had not known better, I would have guessed these characters were written by a man with his own woman problems. I read it quickly -- it was a good, fast read, despite the length. But at the end I find I'm a bit disappointed with the handling of female stereotypes in the book, and I'm unsettled. And I must admit that the title really did make me wary at the outset. I may not know exactly where I fall on the overall evaluation of this book for a few days, after I have a chance to mull it over. I notice that many reviews are written by those who have read some or all of the previous books in the series, and perhaps I just happened to get the one dealing with ambitious mothers and she has a range of female characters in the other books. Hard for me to tell from here, so I'm leaving this door half open, not commiting to any extreme in the ratings.

Don't know if I just hit a string of great books or I am more generous than usual. This was a great listen--I did 124 chapters in just 4 days. Elizabeth George is so wonderful with British mysteries. The environment, characters, understanding of police and Scotland Yard its all here. I feel like my son with a Harry Potter book. Can't wait for it to arrive and then can't stop till it is done. I found reasons to walk and ride just to listen. Neglected reading anything just to listen at every opportunity.This mystery centered around the investigation of a church deacon who is found dead in a holding cell in a small town jail. He was brought in due to a charge of pediophilia and is believed to have committed suicide while waiting to be taken to the main jail. Is it suicide or murder, was the investigation carried off correctly and the right conclusions reached? This is how the story begins but it certainly doesn't end there. All of George's characters are here, which is so fun, as more recent books seem to deal with just one or the other. There is oodles of conflict, in families, police departments and Scotland Yard personnel. The mystery unspools slowly and so so well. George's mysteries are long but one never feels that a single page could be eliminated. So great I'm thinking of going back to another I read years ago as it will be difficult to wait for the next.
