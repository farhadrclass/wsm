The writing was competant and kept me reading until the end, but the ending was dark. I think the description is misleading - I found no hope and no redemption. In addition I found the language and sexual description much more vulgar (and I use that word for its original meaning) than I normally partake in (I read mostly older literature)."}, {"userName": "Colin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2840568-colin", "userReview": "Galveston ended up being better than I expected. Before reading this book I had read one other book by Quarrington and thought it was OK, but nothing special. It was good enough that I wanted to explore another one of his novels, but not spectacular to make me breathless with anticipation. Galveston has an intriguing premise. A group of strangers arrive on the island of Dampier Cay, located in the Carribean, some looking for fun in the sun, others who are \"weather weenies\", hoping that hurricane Claire would blow over this tiny island. Most of the characters are damaged in some way; damaged in such a way that their decisions run to the extreme. If the reader has some idea of what the title, Galveston, stands for, they will have some idea of where the story is headed. Quarrington explains what happened in Galveston more than a century before the time when this story is set, and that knowledge hangs over the book like a dark, stormy expectation. It is for the most part a character driven book, but with a, more or less, but with an ensemble cast. Most of the characters are quirky, but reasonably drawn. Overall a fun, interesting story, well written, and thoughtful. Recommended to people who like quirky characters with disparate motivations, dealing with extreme situations."}, {"userName": "Joanna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/620387-joanna", "userReview": "I picked up this strange book purely because of the title; I've never read any other books by this prolific author. The book is hard to describe. The plot centers around a few people who, with different degrees of intentionality, find themselves on a small island during a major hurricane. Three \"weather weenies\" wanted to be where the storm was, two vacationers landed there by accident, and three residents of the island basically live there. Plus the mostly dropped sideline of two property owners who came to look after their property during the storm.The description of the storm and the reverence for the energy of weather was compelling. None of the characters was particularly lovable, with the possible exception of the pirate-descended Maywell, but I was absorbed by their stories. And a few of the sarcastic observations of the book were both darkly comic and wonderful (\"in the land of the damned, there is no nap time\"). Unfortunately, the resolution didn't quite work for me and I found myself wishing for more hope or optimism or something for the characters.The writing was compelling enough that I'd be interested to read other books by this author, but I'm not sure I'll be rushing to recommend this one."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13639920-erin", "userReview": "I\u2019d never tell anyone not to read Paul Quarrington\u2019s Galveston, but neither would I recommend it. The novel sees three storm chasers arrive on a small island - Dampier Cay - a day before the arrival of a category 5 hurricane. Two of the chasers have traumatic pasts. One is just in it for the glory.The parts I liked? Learning bits about hurricanes. Descriptions of the wind.Parts I didn\u2019t? Endless and extreme symbolism, such that I felt battered myself by the barrage of this-means-this and look-out here comes another symbol, duck! you might get hit by significance!Meh.

Full of characters dealing with significant mental issues who have all wound up on a remote island (some by choice, some by circumstance), but all must battle to survive a major weather event that threatens to level the island.I didn't really relate or like any of the characters. I felt sorry for them all in some way and their respective situations - especially for the two girls in their early twenties who were trying to book a sunny vacation and ended up with something totally different."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5594066-kelly", "userReview": "A quick read about a variety of characters converging on an island for a massive hurricane. The story takes you through the broken lives of several characters and culminates in a frenzy of action, not unlike the hurricane that is raging. I still have some unanswered questions about the story but overall it was a simple story about people, how they get to be the people they are and what they are looking for in life."}, {"userName": "VWrulesChick", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2579666-vwruleschick", "userReview": "What happens when you have had a hard life, when you no longer have feeling, but numbness.

Visitors usually wash up there by accident, rather than by design. But this weekend, three people will fly to the island deliberately. They are not coming for a tan or fun in the sun. They are coming because Dampier Cay is where it is, and they have reason to believe that they might encounter something there that most people take great measures to avoid -- a hurricane.A lottery windfall and a few hours of selfishness have robbed Caldwell of all that was precious to him, while Beverly, haunted by tragedy and screwed by fate since birth, has given up on life. Also on the flight is Jimmy Newton, a professional storm chaser and videographer who will do anything for the perfect shot. Waiting for them at Dampier is the manager of the Water\u2019s Edge Hotel, \u201cBonefish\u201d Maywell Hope, who arrived at Dampier by the purest accident of all -- the accident of birth. A descendent of the pirates who sailed the Caribbean hundreds of years ago, Hope believes if he works hard enough, he can prevent the inevitable. Until, that is, the seas begin to rise . . . Cinematic and harrowing, spiced with Quarrington\u2019s trademark humour, Galveston shows just how far people will go to feel alive.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Galveston", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1160586.Galveston", "average": 3.36, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320497959l/1160586.jpg", "reviews": 17, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/159637.Paul_Quarrington", "name": "Paul Quarrington"}], "type": ["Cultural", "Fiction", "Contemporary", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1160586.Galveston", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13532568-galveston", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1411783.Galveston", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2322130.King_Leary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/646887.Whale_Music", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1411801.The_Ravine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1411786.Home_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2168390.The_Spirit_Cabinet"]}
