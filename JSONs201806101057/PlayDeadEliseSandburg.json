Frasier gets back to the zombie roots, ignoring the scientific, weaponized creation of zombies and looking at the voodoo/hoodoo roots of zombie creation. Now, don\u2019t let that fool you, this is not a \u201chorror\u201d novel. While I initially got the book because it was listed as a voodoo-horror-novel, it\u2019s actually a mystery-crime story, and the \u201czombies\u201d aren\u2019t really supernatural creatures at all. In fact, zombies are really just a side note in the story, and the plot really revolves around the use of the drug TTX (from the puffer fish) which in folklore could be used to create zombie slaves. The plot is fast paced for the most part and the mystery intriguing. Frasier does an excellent job describing Southern (and voodoo) culture as well as creating a mystery that makes the book hard to put down. You will want to know what happens next. That being said, Frasier changes character perspectives throughout the book, and these get very confusing. The transitions are choppy, and while they are separated by a space or chapter break I found myself having to reread pages just so I could figure out what character these thoughts were supposed to be coming from. Which made reading a little frustrating. This gets increasingly confusing towards the end of the book. While I understand Frasier is trying to build to the killer reveal (which is a fantastic twist) while putting the killer in the book without giving anything away (the first person narratives), the strategy just doesn\u2019t work as well as it could of and instead of leaving me intrigued I was just confused.The three characters the story revolves around are Elise, David Gould, and Strata Luna. These three characters are done excellently, Frasier gives us enough backstory to make us feel for them, and they each have a unique personality that adds to the story. Elise is the Southerner with a bizarre history, as well as the lead cop on the murder investigation the plot revolves around. David is Elise\u2019s partner, and from up North (a point which he is reminded of constantly by everyone throughout the story) but has a heartbreaking past of his own. Strata Luna is the obligatory \u201cwitch\u201d character, who practices spells, makes mojos, and just seems a little strange. She also has a history which is brought up throughout the book, and her personality gives this book the color that makes it such a fun read. The minor characters, however, all seem a little flat, they serve their purpose but, with the exception of one or two, don\u2019t bring much to the story.Frasier has a talent for bringing Southern culture alive in her writing, and she sets up a very gothic setting for her book. Children chant rhymes while jump roping which give you some foreshadowing about what will happen later in the book (or to mislead you). The buildings are described in detail, and everything just seems a little creepy. It\u2019s the perfect setting for this kind of murder mystery. Description is obviously Frasier\u2019s strong point, as the dialogue falls flat in some places, but that can be easily overlooked by the fast paced story going on around it. The narrative makes this book an easy read, and the plot just pulls you along as it unfolds. As I mentioned before, the point of view changes do make things a little confusing and can bring the flow of the plot to a halt while you try and sort out who\u2019s who again, but for the most part the book really does flow.Frasier has done an excellent job with \u2018Play Dead\u2019. I enjoyed the folklore of zombie history sprinkled throughout the plot and the mystery is cleverly done. It\u2019s an enjoyable crime read with an element of the supernatural twisted in. I\u2019d advise you to read it at night with the lights off if you want a good scare"}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9401390-rachel", "userReview": "This was a really interesting book. I put this book in the fiction sub-category of southern gothic - it is a suspense/murder mystery, but the sort of legends within the story and elements of voodoo, conjuring, and root work add something extra for me. Elise is a detective, and also a struggling single mom. She has ultimately sacrificed her relationship with her daughter to her job, preferring to think of her daughter as having a more whole and normal life living with her Dad and step-mom. David is Elise's new partner, a transfer from another department, complete with a shady history no one particularly knows the real truth about. Without spoiling anything, he is also dealing with divorce, and not too far into the book visits his wife in prison to sign the papers\u2026 A large portion of the story focuses on the two (to borrow from another reviewer who hit the nail on the head\u2026) \"suitably flawed\" detectives working on opening up to each other, to begin to trust and each to become the partner they need to be to the other. BUT\u2026 as they are working through these issues, they are tracking down a killer. Someone is picking off Savannah's prostitutes, killing in a most torturous manner using TTX - a poison derived from puffer fish that leaves the victim paralyzed but completely conscious and aware. Bodies in Savannah are \"coming back to life\"\u2026 Elise and David are faced with multiple victims who were pronounced dead, only to be discovered to still be alive, but beyond saving. The poison is so deadly it keeps the victim conscious even as their bodily systems are shutting down.Aside from her present struggles, Elise also has a checkered past. It has long been rumored that she is the daughter of a notorious white root doctor, the now-deceased Jackson Sweet, and was abandoned at birth in a local cemetery. Elise grew up in an adoptive home, never knowing her mother's name, and having nothing more to go on than the rumor of her paternity. Clues about Elise's past begin to come to light as infamous Savannah Madam and voodoo queen Strata Luna is drawn into the investigation. The stories surrounding Strata Luna are even more harrowing. The sense of place and time are excellent, and I think that Frasier absolutely did her research as far as the voodoo and root work. The book was well-paced for the most part, and information about the killer was sufficiently drawn out over the course of the book. My one and only issue with the book was that I felt like the ending got a little rushed, and the final ID of the killer didn't flow from the clues drawn out over the story. The revelation of the killer was really abrupt. I felt like I would have liked a little more story to lead me up to it. Also, Elise's relationship with her daughter took a sudden turn that didn't seem to have enough of a foundation or build-up to be entirely realistic. Those things aside though, this was still an enjoyable read. There is a sequel, and I would definitely check it out for a fun read."}, {"userName": "Karen Fowler", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4985963-karen-fowler", "userReview": "Despite the fact that I have numerous other books in my to-be-read pile I couldn't help moving Play Dead to the front based on the cover alone. It's fantastically creepy and morose. Which I was apparently in the mood for when I started reading this earlier today. Ironically, after I finished the book I realized that I've recently read another book by Frasier (HUSH) and while I enjoyed that one, I adored this novel. Set in the sweltering south amid voodoo lore and \"root doctoring\" (a phrase I hadn't heard in a while) the main character Elise is divorced,a detective, living in a perpetually partially renovated house and has a daughter who'd rather be anywhere else. And then there is the detached partner who's keeping secrets to preserve his own sanity. When bodies start coming to life after being declared dead, Elise and her partner are swept into a dark world of spells, secrets and betrayals.I found this novel an excellent read. With it's evocative setting, woven in folklore and complex character issues, I couldn't get it read fast enough. At the end (well done, by the way) I found myself hoping that there is at least a sequel planned, if not a whole series. Play Dead is a quirky, fast-paced mystery with undercurrents of family drama and southern lore.

It is a creepy, southern gothic, murder thriller. I have read a few by this author before. Elise is a detective for the Savannah Police Dept. David has transferred out of the FBI, from Ohio, and is now her partner. He has some deep issues, but when you find out why, you feel for the guy. Elise has partial custody of her thirteen year old teenage daughter, which is a struggle. The book grabs you almost at once. People who are pronounced dead, are still alive. It takes you into voodoo practices, and charms, and curses. It all seems to blend with the atmosphere of the old mansions, heavy moss hanging on trees, gifts of blessings left at graves of those that handled black magic, and still frightened people today, but superstitions die hard. Bodies continue to be found, and a puffer fish drug, and other chemicals seem to be in the mix. Are zombies being made? Soon the city is as paralyzed, as the victims are. The story leads you one way, only to turn in another direction. I was not surprised by the ending, at least not in the who. I was shocked in part of the why. It kept me very interested, and the main characters were well fleshed out. A few of the supporting characters were not that important to me. I do understand that there is still a feeling in the south against Yankees. It does at times still feel that the war is still on in attitude, and comments. I understood David, and the antagonistic comments, and complaints against him, since I was from the north, and could not believe that this feeling still exists. It sometimes feels that the deep believers ,feel another war can start, and the outcome will be different. The nature of how afraid people can become, over a superstition, or in voodoo made the book that much mote interesting. Some places revel in the experience of death like New Orleans, or Savannah. Ghost tours, and cemetery adventures are on the list of places to view, while on a trip there. Plus the agonizing feelings of those still alive while, their bodies were dying was pretty creepy. Suddenly no one wanted loved ones buried until they began to rot, and fish of all kinds were removed from grocery stores, and restaurants. Hysteria can be addictive, and contagious. I will be reading more by this author. Thrilling until the end....."}, {"userName": "Shari Kay", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12496588-shari-kay", "userReview": "goes places I have no interest in visitinghttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show... <---book 4"}, {"userName": "Laura  Hernandez", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16419149-laura-hernandez", "userReview": "The plot and narrator made this an enjoyable listen that kept me on the edge of my seat."}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28347474-kristina", "userReview": "Looking forward to this new series to follow!

He's a former FBI agent with a hooker girlfriend! Together, they fight crime!\"The \"exotic\" locale is Savannah, Georgia - so, not all that exotic. But it's dripping with \"Southern.\"Elise Sandburg is alleged to be the daughter of an infamous \"root doctor\" - a practitioner of voodoo. Accordingly to her family, she was found abandoned in a cemetery as a baby. Adopted by a nice Christian couple that never really warmed up to her, she is now a single mother with a rebellious teenage daughter and a concerned ex-husband.Her new partner is a \"Yankee\" who doesn't get along with anyone else in the department. He also, it turns out, has his own tragic, angsty past. The two of them warm up to each other a little over the course of an investigation that involves someone using tetrodotoxin, or \"zombie powder,\" to leave paralyzed and dead bodies around Savannah.The plot twists through voodoo curses and family secrets, as the case snakes through both Elise and her partner's personal lives.

The detectives were suitably flawed - David Gould is a damaged FBI agent, haunted by a personal tragedy and driven to self destruction. His partner, Elise Sandburg, is a single mum with her own mysterious past, and connections to the occult. the book is really a mystical police procedural, and probably wont be everybodys cup of tea.
