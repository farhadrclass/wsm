I don\u2019t really care much for Richard. I don\u2019t. I just don\u2019t like him, or crap that comes along with him What can I say? A dramatic and goody boy scout just isn\u2019t the guy for me. It wasn\u2019t until I was about 15% into the book that I remembered all of the delicious things that were awaiting me I\u2019m quoting a pretty large paragraph from the book, but it\u2019s a great way to explain the relationship between Anita and her two men, Richard and Jean-Claude.Richard was an alpha werewolf. He was head of the local pack. It was his only serious flaw. We\u2019d broken up after I\u2019d seen him eat somebody. What I\u2019d seen had sent me running to Jean-Claude\u2019s arms. I\u2019d run from the werewolf to the vampire. Jean-Claude was Master of the City of Saint Louis. He was definitely not the more human of the two. I know there isn\u2019t a lot to choose from between a bloodsucker and a flesh-eater, but at least after Jean-Claude finished feeding, there weren\u2019t chunks between his fangs. A small distinction but a real one. Richard is brought up on attempted rape charges. He\u2019s off somewhere else working on his Master\u2019s degree when he gets himself into trouble.Anita to the rescue! Unfortunately, the Master Vampire of the City where he is being held in jail, has refused her admittance. She decides to give the vampire a call and gracefully states that she and her people would be entering the city to help her Richard.\u201cLook, Colin, stay out of my way, and I\u2019ll stay out of yours. You fuck with me, and I will destroy you, do you understand me? It\u2019s only war if you start it, but if you start something, by God I will finish it.\u201d Jean-Claude was motioning for the phone rather desperately.  (heh)Finding herself surrounded by her pack and pard and two vampires, she\u2019s thrown into a political world with the local pack. Corrupted cops, lying whoredom cowgirls, meeting the many women that Richard has been sleeping with or as he put it \u201cAuditioning to replace her as lupa\u201d, demons and psychotic rapists, this book is intriguing and just off the charts. I cannot believe that I would forget how amazing this book is! Lies and betrayal is admitted to Anita by a vampire that she was unaware shared an interesting and profound bond with her. No longer sure whom to trust, Anita reacts on instincts alone. The lines that were carefully drawn, the lines she always refused to cross, the lines that dictated good versus evil, are finally crossed with more than a tip-toe. In this book, Blake turns into the monster she always feared, always hunted. Ironically, it is not the acts that she commits that send her into shock, it\u2019s the fact that she did not regret them. They were not wrong. She bloodied and tortured and the only thought, the only regret, is that she did not have more time to instill more damage on her victim.A must read! I recommend this book to any adults in need of superlicious gore and lust. A paranormal romance filled with extraordinary violence and sexual abuse. Rape seems to be a reoccurring theme in Hamilton\u2019s books. It makes you wonder if she has suffered a trauma, has a fetish or if she is merely intrigued with the idea of violation being part of the monstrous plots in her books.Happy reading!"}, {"userName": "Misty", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124284-misty", "userReview": "If you want to read a synopsis, there are plenty of places for you to do that elsewhere. This is what I thought of the book:Though I did end up liking this in the end, for about the first 1/2 of the book, all of the things I don't like about Hamilton's style were out in full force. She has a tendency toward cliches, ridiculous repetitiveness (Note to Laurell K. Hmailton: ok, its the 8th book in the effing series - if we don't know certain things, we should start from the beginning, but you sure as hell shouldn't tell us those same certain things in each book like its new info, and you REALLY shouldn't just copy and paste - we may not recognize it the first time or two it is repeated word for word, but the 6th or 7th? Give your readers a little credit. Those who pick up a book mid-series deserve to be a little confused. You just have to trust that your writing alone will make it clear, not your endless reiterations. And for god's sake, don't stop in the middle of action and ruin the tension with your little tangents.) She also needs to pay a little more attention to detail, or keep some post-it notes, or something, because she contradicts herself on occasion, or bobbles back and forth (ie the main character is 25, and she says on a few occasions that Jean-Claude is nearly 300 years older than her, putting him somewhere between 300-324; she also frequently states that Jean-Claude is over 400 years old. Maybe Anita, the narrator, has had a few too many concussions, cause something just aint right...). There are always so many plot lines going, I think maybe Hamilton just splits her focus too much and gets lost. Which unfortunately means her endings can be abrupt and read like an epilogue/after-thought.But she did get the book on track, and I did end up liking it (and even though there were parts that irritated me -- especially my inner-editor -- I was never NOT engaged), and though I am sure these bad habits will continue through the rest of the ridiculously long series, I will read it, fixing the defects in my mind as I go.Side note; for those of you who read the series and like your Anita lustful, this one certainly does not disappoint. ;)"}, {"userName": "Crystal Starr Light", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light", "userReview": "\"You are making this too complicated.\"Anita Blake is woken in the middle of the night by a call from Daniel, Richard's younger brother. It appears while Richard was in Tennessee studying trolls and such for his master's thesis that he has been thrown in jail for rape. Anita immediately comes to the rescue, along with Asher, Damien, Jason, Jamil, Cherry, and a few other were's, against the explicit orders of the Master of the City, Colin. Can Anita clear Richard's name, keep her troop alive, and learn her burgeoning new abilities?I'm really on the fence with the rating on this one. There were some key plot elements that I liked, but more than ever, there were parts that bugged the hell out of me.I've never been a fan of Anita. I've always thought she's been b!tchy and unlikable, thinking more with whatever weapon she has at hand then with her brain. But Anita here is somehow even more unlikable than she's been in the last 7 books.+ She calls Cherry a slut on numerous occasions for wearing \"slutty clothes\"--and then proceeds to wear a velvet midriff baring blouse with a neckline so low she had to wear a special black bra. + She basically causes the fight with Colin because she insists on barging in and fighting with the native vampires.+ While the situation is critical and people are severely injured, she starts talking about people's sexual orientation, as if it is her business who they have sex with.+ She criticizes Richard for sleeping around, when she cheated on Richard with Jean-Claude.+ She is upset when Richard refuses to be monogamous unless Anita dumps Jean-Claude but expects Richard to respect her relationship with Jean-Claude. Anita also makes out with at least THREE guys with whom she is not in a relationship: Nathaniel, Asher, and Damien.+ Anita resorts to torture or coercion TWICE in order to obtain information (one of those times, she refuses to allow medical treatment until she finds out what she wants) and then justifies her actions and \"becoming the monster\".+ She never turns herself in for MURDER and TORTURE.Okay, so before she was b!tchy, trigger-happy and impulsive, but at least she didn't commit blatant crimes (murder, torture, etc.) and then come across as the Spotless Pure and Holy Mother of God (well, she does hem and haw about \"becoming the monster\").The books have already started to move away from the formula of the earlier entries--and not in a good way. I may not have been fond of the \"Monster of the Week\" plot device, but at least the earlier books bothered to HAVE a plot, a beginning, middle, and end.The shame is, there IS a good plot in here. I liked Anita leaving to \"rescue\" Richard. I thought that if we had introduced the troll/corrupt cop/hidden artifact portion earlier in the novel, we would have a lot stronger of a novel.Instead, the first half is mainly about Anita making people mad with her big, fat mouth. She walks into another vampire's territory, after he told her not to come, and expects him to just lie down and roll over. I'm sorry, Anita, choices have consequences. I'm sure if some self-important \"Vampire Hunter\" (because, honestly, when was the last time Anita actually hunted a Vampire?) barged into Jean-Claude's territory, you wouldn't hesitate to jump onto her and scare her away.Anita's actions end up with Nathaniel badly injured (though, if LKH was a good author, Nathaniel would have been DEAD). To save his life, Anita has no problems throwing both Damien's AND Asher's lives on the life. For ONE GUY. That she doesn't know that well and DOESN'T EVEN LIKE.The middle portion is mostly about Anita wanting to hump anything with a d!ck. As I said above, she makes out with THREE guys she is not in a relationship with and has sex with Richard. When she is dating Jean-Claude. So basically, she is cheating on her boyfriend, YET AGAIN.The latter portion tries to add a plot, but it's so late in the game, it has to be hastily wrapped up LKH-style: meaning, Anita talks (argues) with someone who knows all the answers to the mystery. Once again, I am floored that Anita is considered so \"smart\". Half of the time, she wanders around having no f@#$ing clue what is going on, asking people over and over and over to explain the plot for her and the audience.As if this weren't bad enough, the middle and latter halves bring up the first hints of the increased sexuality that I've heard plagues the latter books. Damien reveals to Anita that Jean-Claude is basically an incubus; also, Anita learns she must \"be more comfortable\" with sex when dealing with her wereleopards (because they are SO SEXUAL RAWR). Several times, Anita has to make out, disrobe, or do something sexual for some plot convenience--distraction, because of some arcane, never-before heard of plot device, etc. And then we have so much rape. It seems like, in order to show the audience who the bad guys are, LKH has them rape someone--and of course, it's usually the females.I don't think I would mind these so much if it didn't feel so tacked on. Sure, the books have always had a sexual bent; but never in the earlier books did you have so much talk about sex and its relation to sloppily constructed, silly vampire/werewolf/wereleopard laws.And then the clothes!! I'm pretty sure all the men are impotent (probably the women too), as it seems no one can find a pair of pants that isn't \"painted on\".And the writing!! Good God, LKH has never been the most stellar writer, but at least I didn't have to read the phrase \"A glob of something thicker than blood\" a billion times per book in earlier books.BUT there were parts I liked. The plot elements I described, along with a few key characters. Asher still seems pretty cool. I really enjoyed Jamil (who gives the review its title). I enjoyed seeing Anita and Richard get back together, and I nearly fainted to see a somewhat competent, powerful female, Marianne. And Marianne ACTUALLY MENTORS Anita (Anita doesn't know everything OMG)!This is not the worst of the series--but it is close. You can already see the shift in the series, and if you didn't like the change in \"Burnt Offerings\", you are probably not going to like it here. Which is a shame, because LKH does have some really good ideas that, if she had trimmed away the fat, could have made a really good novel. 2.5 stars rounded down to 2 stars."}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "Hey, I found out why Richard is such a whiny dick in this book! His mother - the domineering bitch! Nothing like a horrible, bitchy mother who keeps her sons' testicles in her handbag, to raise a punk-ass, spoiled baby of a son! And, don't forget Richard's brother, Daniel, who we meet, and is just as afraid of their smother, I mean mother.Richard's mommy gets in a bar-fight in this book and Anita has to try and stop her because Richard's brother is too afraid to stop mommy-dearest. Of course, his mother starts hitting Anita and freaking out. She's such a classy lady. I do like how Anita tells her off:\n\"Behave like Richard's mother and not his outraged girlfriend.\"\"How dare you!\" she said. She moved closer, I moved away.\nAh, the yelling of \"how dare you!\" The battle cry of narcissists and old-world aristocrats.The only \"how dare you\" that is justified...So, why only two stars? Well, one of them is for Asher. The other is for Nathaniel and Damian. All other stars were deducted for this book being about Richard, the dick.Richard, the sucky baby, gets thrown in jail for rape. So, of course, his family calls Anita, his ex-girlfriend to drop everything and run to Tennessee to save his sorry ass. And she does!!! Why?His family is there. His current girlfriend is there. Anita isn't a lawyer or cop.Why her?Because reasons, I guess.So, Anita drops everything and rushes down to help sissy-boy. Of course the local sheriff in Hicksville is fat, stupid, and crooked. Again. Sheesh, I guess all small-town cops are bumbling crooks who deserve to die. There couldn't possibly be any that are friendly, efficient, and law-abiding.We're on the case.... of beer!So, when the Keystone Cops tell Anita and Richard that all they have to do is leave town in order to get the rape charge dropped, all they have to do is lie and say they will. Or, better yet, just leave and let the feds know that the cops are crooked. But, no, Richard refuses to leave on the basis that he is an idiot. Even when one of the cops has Anita naked and is about to rape her, Richard refuses to just say the words that he will leave to make it stop. He's willing for them to torture someone else just as much as they want for his principles.Richard can shift into a big ol' pussy too...Needless to say, I was not a big fan of this book. The story premise was stupid, there was no Jean Claude, and way too much Dick."}, {"userName": "Kipi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4857895-kipi", "userReview": "Sex, violence, poor plot, irrational prudishness combined with irrational sexual behavior...

I\u2019m sure I thought it was \u201cone of the best books ever\u201d because I was still a fangirl and it features a whole hell of a lot of Richard and back then I was a fangirl of him too. Now? Eh, I can take him or leave him but that\u2019s only because the author turned him into an alpha-hole of the worst kind and replaced him with likes of Micah and the shifter crew. But that\u2019s a rant for another day. Today we focus on Blue Moon. It opens with a phone call where Anita Blake, Vampire Executioner, Necromancer and Protector of all things furry, defenseless and preternaturally sexy, learns that her ex-love (but not lover) Richard is in jail on rape charges. Then vampire lover boy Jean Claude shows up at her door wanting to do \u201cthe wicked dance\u201d just one more time before she leaves town to save Richard. He\u2019s jealous of Richard\u2019s studliness and feeling insecure. She shoos him away, takes her vampire and shifter entourage and heads out to save the day. Jean Claude is barely a blip on the radar again during this book (I think he calls in once) because he is not allowed to travel to Master of the City vampire Colin\u2019s territory, where Richard is being held, or all-out war will rage. Anita\u2019s not allowed either but she says screw it and goes anyway. I love that about Anita. So, for you Jean Claude fans be warned because this is Richard\u2019s book and Nathaniel\u2019s book, and Jason, Asher and Damien\u2019s too. But mostly this book is Richard\u2019s turn with Anita. She saves his ass only to find out he\u2019s been fooling around with all kinds of women (which contributed to his current troubles) in an attempt to replace her. They fight, as usual, but she doesn\u2019t have much ground to stand on considering she left him for Jean Claude. She still lusts after Richard and what with all of the drama with the beasties and the evil big bad, a few corrupt police officers and the munin raising its horny head, Anita has her hands full.I\u2019m \u201crereading\u201d this series on unabridged audio because I originally gave up on it somewhere after the meh \u201cMicah\u201d and need to refresh my memory if I have any hope of ever completing the series. Blue Moon is narrated by Kimberly Alexis who does a great job voicing the tough as nails, increasingly coldish Anita. Narrator Alexis is all business and it fits really well. She also does a decent job voicing everyone with the exception of Asher and Jean Claude, both who are given faux fancy French accents which make them sound too feminine for comfort. My ears bled a little whenever they were speaking. But I don\u2019t blame the narrator; she did the best she could with the source material. Some of the other characters sound too similar but I could usually figure out who was speaking pretty quickly.I really enjoyed this reread. I wasn\u2019t sure I would but it held up well and kept my attention throughout. The characters dealt with a lot of deep crap, Anita had to work through some of her issues and questioned herself and her values. I liked this Anita. She cares about the people she keeps acquiring and makes tough calls to keep them safe. If she\u2019s a bit bitchy, hell I would be too. This book has some incredibly dark edges. I always forget about that and I appreciate it. I don\u2019t like the sugar-coating too many PNR\u2019s have these days. I have to hand it to Hamilton, she does not flinch while inflicting damage to the innocents in this book.

The main problem, however, is that in this book I found Anita to be totally unlikable (I wanted her to get hit by a Mac truck).

Funny, scary, a touch gory and a touch sexy. As you read each book, you can really see the character development as Anita becomes more sure of herself and more comfortable with the \"monsters\". However, some the later books have deteriorated into little more than soft porn for women. Not that there's anything wrong with that. However, I feel it cheapens the series, which features a great role model in Anita as a women who has accepted that her life works the way it is and makes her happy, even it is not what the rest of the world thinks is normal. She is strong, independent, and accepting of her sexuality."}, {"userName": "zcb257", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6672340-zcb257", "userReview": "Blue Moon is my favourite Anita Blake chapter to date. The initial plot takes a backseat through most of the book, but seeing Anita deal with her place in the pack, delve deeper into her connection to Richard and all that that entails was entertaining. I loved all of the secondary characters, and seeing Anita explore the camaraderie of those relationships. LKH has a great talent in developing characters that are complex and compelling enough that makes me want to know everything about them.I really don\u2019t understand all the bad reviews. I have to assume that, at least in part, they have to do with the fact that the book is so Richard heavy. IMHO focusing on Richard for once is one of the best parts of the book. LKH has spent a lot of time building up Anita\u2019s moral landscape; it is one of the strongest segments of her developed character. So to see her drop it all and run to Jean-Claude was so out of the blue, and against everything that had been built to date that I just couldn\u2019t accept it. The way that LKH dealt with Anita/Richard in this instalment worked. She came up with a scenario that got them together without betraying Anita\u2019s morals and it all made sense in the context of this world.I also have to say that Richard sleeping around is almost as left field as Anita/JC. Why develop characters in such a detailed fashion then watch them betray everything they believe in for no apparent reason. I mean every single book that has had anything to do with Richard has shouted how much of a \u2018Boy Scout\u2019 he is, including this one. I know LKH gives us apparent reasons; Richard being hurt over what happened with JC, and Anita running to JC because she couldn\u2019t accept what she\u2019d seen. However, in comparison to their moral characters those reasons were not good enough to make the actions ring true.To the nitpicking: I would be very, very happy to never read another description of the Browning, or Firestar ever again, not to mention how they are placed or hidden on Anita\u2019s body. The same goes for Anita\u2019s Nike\u2019s, and her choice of clothing in respect to how the guns will be hidden. I don\u2019t care, and I would think that a majority of reader\u2019s don\u2019t either.Even with my issue\u2019s, I still thoroughly enjoyed this peek at Anita\u2019s life overall. I do hope that the relationship with Richard continues, at least for a little while. At the very least, it just makes sense, but more than that he\u2019s a far better match than JC."}, {"userName": "Ithlilian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4793655-ithlilian", "userReview": "I hate to say it but, this is my least favorite book in this series. The first 300 pages dragged so much. Richard is in jail on false charges so Anita comes to investigate and free him. Unfortunately, the master of the city there does not take kindly to super powerful vampire killer invading his lands. There are issues with the local were pack as well. After plenty of killing and countless annoying Anita and Richard squabbles, Anita finally sleeps with Richard. Only to find out that it makes their bond stronger. Now she is mad at Jean-Claude and Richard for not telling her. Then we get to the mystery (if you can call it that) of the book. Someone is blaming murders on trolls to try to find an artifact hidden in the land. Anita tortures one of the baddies and saves the day, the end!What really bothers me here is the love triangle between Anita, Richard, and Jean-Claude. After sleeping with Richard, Anita is given permission to continue to sleep with Jean-Claude. Richard, understandably, says that he will continue to sleep with other people as well. Anita does not like that of course, and I just don't get it. She isn't happy with just having one, she isn't happy with both, and she isn't happy with neither. Guess what! She continues to be unhappy about it for the entire series! Richard can't accept his beast, can't accept humans that accept his beast, won't sleep with weres, and doesn't like that Anita is turning into a monster. Anita doesn't like to touch anyone even if it is just for comfort, even if it alienates her leopards. She doesn't like that Richard eats people, even though she tortures people and enjoys it, she doesn't like that Richard doesn't accept his beast, even though she can't get close to her packs. Jean-Claude seems to be using everyone for power, according to Anita, and she doesn't trust him, and doesn't believe that he loves her. This continues for a long time in this series. As annoying as that is, I still love all the secondary characters in this series: Asher, Damien, Edward, Nathaniel, etc. Anita does become more accepting of what she needs to do to survive, and becomes closer to her animals in the future. This book just stands out as different from the previous novels. The mystery is almost nonexistent and the drama is everywhere.

It's getting to be a bit much. Hamilton clearly must have found her (weird and twisted) audience, but as I've said a bunch of times, I would have liked her series better if she had stayed on the path it looked like she was originally on, with Anita solving preternatural crimes, rather than becoming Queen of the Underworld. You know how it's annoying that Stephanie Plum can't decide between Ranger and Morelli after what feels like a hundred books?

Hamilton's novel, Blue Moon, has several connotations. One, it's a place. Blue Moon is a camping area that people come to play or in this case people come to die. Blue Moon is like the old jazz song, \"You left me standing alo ho hone...\" And thirdly, Blue Moon is rare - a full moon twice in a thirty day period - which can spell havoc for werewolves, who are drawn to the lunar light and have a nasty habit of getting hairy at the drop of a paw.In the previous book Anita broke up with Richard when she freaked out at the site of him changing into a werewolf and then eating his enemy. Yuk. In this book, Anita is walking down a dark path of death and destruction. She finds it easier to kill. She gets creative in creating trouble for her wolfpack. Her were-leopard friends are becoming more touch-friendly and she is playing with fire when it comes to handling Nyer and his wish for the Spear of Christ, an artifact that was supposedly the spear that went through Christ at the Crucifixion 2000 years ago.The book is troubling for several reasons: Anita is even more moral-less than in past novels. She does not hesitate to shoot to kill. In one scene, she tortures a guy to tell her where some kidnap victims are, and then shoots him in the head to shut him up! Morals? What? She meets another necromancer, a psychic and a killer, not in that order. There is also Colin the vampire that they make a big deal out of. Colin does not want Anita in his territory. That part of the story builds well but is over by the halfway point, sadly. No real development of that aspect. Hamilton really gets into the Richard/Jean Claude/Anita triumvirate and we discover the true intentions of Jean Claude's apparent magnanimous gesture in letting Anita have sex with Richard, not as graphic as it could have been. Hamilton wears me down with the same old actions over and over - sudden ring - \"Jumpy, who me?\" about five times in each novel. Annoying. Marianne is the only stable character in the mess. She's some kind of witch or clairvoyant, who uses her positive energy in the same way Anita uses her negative energy. Calling her \"child\" and understanding Anita's churning mental state, she guides Anita to a more manageable character.

Deliciously, Anita is gaining powers and morphing with her questioning every nuance she doesn't understand. For me, this book showed to be well written with great character and relationship development among were-leopards, were-wolves and vampires.I enjoyed not having so much Jean-Claude in this book. Richard got more time in this book which was delightful in some of the revelations of his escapades.From trying to rescue Richard from jail and numerous fights with humans compounded by continuing vampire politics and cruelty, Anita was thrown between life and death battles from beginning to end in this tale. I truly admire Anita\u2019s trait to protect and care for shifters and vampires with the stamina and courage even when she could sacrifice her life. I like her take charge attitude which always annoys her foes, and even some friends from crisis to crisis. Her character is becoming more like-able.Her growing powers and ability to heal are fascinating and how much the munin and shades of Raina were tormenting her in trying to master these powers. I also like the unique way LKH raises the erotic temperature and temptations for Anita and her companions and how the roles of Lupa of the wolves and Nimir-Ra of the leopards mandate physical closeness she is most uncomfortable with at the beginning which diminish slowly. I was pleased at how this resolved near the end of the book.I genuinely liked this book more than those that came before. New characters, new romances, new enemies, and unusual skirmishes and battle tactics combined made this a great read for me.

It was one of the first vampire series I get involved in and previously I really enjoyed it. But after few books I decided I need a break and it took me a lot of time to come back to the series. I still like it in spite of the love triangle I usually hate in every book.The story is good and grabbing with lots of pack and shifters stuff. However, some parts are rather dark and I'm not sure about what to think about them but I didn't feel the need to stop reading. So I think it was OK. Still, I wish it was more Jean-Claude in the story, I was constantly waiting for him to appear but his part is completely reduced in the story. I also wish Anita will come up with an idea what to do with her two lovers and gain some emotional balance. Her constantly pushing and pulling Jean-Claude and Richard is slowly driving me mad.I feel like it's time to continue with the series. It's really interesting to read it again after all this time as I'm older and read so many similar stories during these years.

This book was on the clearance rack at the local used bookstore for $1 and Laurell K. Hamilton has a reputation for racy vampire books so I gave it a shot. Read it in one sitting. Entertaining.

The racy parts were racy but readable, unlike some books where the cliches are too awful to handle. Nothing particularly bad about Blue Moon but not a whole lot there either.

It's annoying that everyone's clothing in every scene has to be explained in complete detail. Does Anita even have a job anymore? And what happened to her apprentice (whose name I can't even remember now)? Anita is known as the most ruthless and successful vampire executioner, but yet she hasn't had a contract in ages, and even her work with the police has been minimal at best. She constantly expects from people what she is not willing to give them in return, and with every book I seem to hate her just a little bit more.And while we're on this train of thought, where is the plot in this book? It starts with Richard, Anita's ex-fiance and alpha werewolf, being jailed for alleged sexual assault of a woman. Anita knows that Richard would not be capable of such a thing, so heads off to rescue him. It is made obvious from the start that Richard was being framed, but why? Well, that takes about 300 pagers to answer, and has to do with the local collective of trolls. A big bad businessman is trying to buy the land the trolls are on because there is supposed to be an ancient relic that he wants....for some reason. Because Richard is trying to save the trolls, he refuses to leave town, and Anita stays with him, even though this pisses off the entire local vampire contingent. Through it all, Anita struggles with the many different factions she has a part in (shape shifter, vampire, werewolf, human) and is still coming to terms with her new powers through the trivariate.Then there is Anita herself.......In my saner moments, I worried that I was becoming a sociopath. But right now, there was nothing but a very calm knowledge that I'd do it. I'd pull the trigger and watch him die at my feet. And feel nothing.Anita, Anita, Anita. We stablished this two books ago. YOU ARE A SOCIOPATH!!!!!Sorry, I'll try to focus.After choosing Jean-Claude two books ago, she finally gives in to her attraction to Richard and they do the dirty. Anita has always been a bit of a prude, and while she seems to at least acknowledge this, I would actually challenge this and say that she is actually sex obsessed. She has trouble separating affection from sex, and everything to her is sexual. Someone is partly clothed and she pictures what they are like in bed, a man comes to hug her and she thinks they are going to grope her. Then when Richard asks her to be monogamous, she says that she loves Jean-Claude and wants to keep sleeping with him, but when Richard then says he will sleep with other werewolves as well, she goes into hysterics and cries endlessly because he would be with other women. ARE YOU SERIOUS!!Whoops, slipped up there.Oh, an another thing, she kills indiscriminately, and while she says she feels bad about it and feels sick about what she has done, I don't really believe her. Anita spoke about how her guns make her feel powerful, and they are something that her two lovers don't have, and that's why she just uses them willy nilly. How can she say that Richard is a monster when he refuses to kill anyone, and the only one he has killed was because she practically forced him to do it! She's the only MONSTER here!!!Ummmm, I got carried away again. Let's change the subject.The only real saving grace is the large cast of secondary characters. Asher, Damien, Zane, Cherry, Nathaniel, and Jason (to name only a few). They are all fair, at times humorous, and even illuminating. Jason mostly:\"I'll tell you the horrible truth, Anita. Mo matter what you do or how bad you feel about it, life just goes on. Life doesn't give a fuck that you're sorry or upset or deranged or tormented. Life just goes on, and you gotta go on with it, or sit in the middle of the road and feel sorry for yourself. And I don't see you doing that.\"They seem to be the only ones with any sense, any loyalty, and for some unknown reason a lot of them are either in love with Anita or will risk their lives for her. Maybe the reason why I like these b-characters better is because they don't disguise what they are, or make apologies for it. And Anita can either accept that, or not. But it is because of the extended cast members that the plot moves along at all, and holds some semblance of my interest.Think I'm going to take a break for a while before returning to Anita's world....or I fear that every item in my house will be smashed against a wall."}, {"userName": "chucklesthescot", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426724-chucklesthescot", "userReview": "Richard is arrested on trumped up rape charges by crooked cops who want him to stop interfering in local matters, so Anita and the gang go down to bail him out. Soon it becomes clear that the police are happy to kill everyone while Anita deals with werewolf politics, supernatural psychos and learning to rule her pard.OK this book was a real let down for me. Anita has turned from feisty human to whiny bitch in this book. It was obvious that she was going to have sex with Richard which was fine but her attitude really bugged me. She had dumped Richard for Jean Claude but kept moaning about Richard sleeping with other people as if he was cheating on her. Then when she agrees to date Richard again, she thinks its unfair that he intends to sleep with other people as well-Anita, you are not intending to give up Jean Claude to be faithful to Richard so why in the blue hell should he owe you monogamy??? The constant whining about this really got on my last nerve.Secondly, Richard's mother and brother are raped by the bad guys this time instead of his pack members. The rapes are just thrown into the conversation as an excuse for Anita to torture a man and then it isn't deemed important enough for more than a quick summing up paragraph at the end. Why bother having it happen then? I'm not bothered by having rape used as a storyline as such if there is a point to it and the story is followed through but I don't think that happened here which left me wondering why it was used.The werewolf politics really bored me to tears-whole sections on how to great each other correctly and where to sniff and all that stuff and in the end, Anita doesn't even go to the pack meeting! So what was the point in all that stuff being described? It was a waste of time. All this political stuff is just shoved in to pad the book up and it is not interesting or relevant to what happens in the book. Can I also add that Nathaniel continually getting into trouble is becoming old very fast? I'm getting tired of the constant explanations about her being lupa and queen Leopard and how soft and used her leopards have been. I got it the first time you wrote it, I don't need to hear it another 50 times in each book thank you.As for Richard, if I was Anita I would have kneecapped him. What the hell kind of man are you? You are such a good boy that you can't lie to the crooked police about leaving town to save the woman you love from being molested by one of them? Really classy Richard. It also bugged me that we never found out what the hell happened to the trolls which was the whole reason for Richard being there and being arrested.There was too much in this book that annoyed me-the constant meetings being arranged, the weak leopards, Anita's whining, half baked plot threads that led nowhere, over descriptive pack political crap, repetition of the story so far about 100 times, descriptions of every outfit that every single person was wearing, the usual description of every weapon every time her hand touched one...Grr.The only thing left to wonder at the end of this book is when Anita is going to start screwing Asher, Damien, Jason, Zack and Nathaniel."}, {"userName": "Mary Grace", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4202510-mary-grace", "userReview": "After book 1-7 showing Anita as one tough babe, Hamilton decided that this book becomes the window to seeing Anita's vulnerability. I always enjoyed Anita's kick ass attitude but this twist to the character made me love Anita more. It's a complete circle already. A girl wth beauty, power, and incredible strenght who is not just capable of doing efficient job but also is vulnerable to pain and love.What is alarming about the book for some is the injection of the sexual aspect of the characters involve. Anita no longer balances a few powers but also made a triumvate of power with the two most powerful creatures in St. Louis. Which makes Anita, Jean Claude and Richard a strong force to defend and protect the people they care about but can also be a deadly force against enemies. Since Hamilton is a great story teller, you don't expect a mild sexual read. So to people who are not yet open to this kind of novel, might as well read the first seven books.Though I am not hating the sexual tension, I just felt that the insertion of the sexual aspect in the series lost the impact of the books altogether. From the uphill climb of the previous book, this on the flat surface of the mountain. A plateau.So overall, still a good read with a little precaution because of the sexual aspect for readers who doesn't enjoy that.

The reasons behind this set-up were really intriguing and made for a very interesting plot. Unfortunately large chunks of the book were taken up with Anita's burgeoning sexuality and a chase through the woods as the werewolf pack lose control. Instead, what started as the main plot gets sidelined and tied up at the end rather quickly without ever getting the due care and attention it deserved. This is the first time I really noticed that good, well thought out plots, were being sidelined for more sex scenes or scenes where the tensions seems to get unnecessarily ratcheted up a notch just because someone blinks at the wrong time.

I have no problem with an author using rape in their story IF its actually important to the plot, and IF its treated with taste and respect, but just casually mentioning that a couple of characters get raped?
