The main characters have moments of unlike-ability but you soon understand their reasons for it. I believe that, at this time, this is Ms. Goodman's only contemporary romance. Written with some darker content it might be hard for some people to enjoy.With the deaths of their married friends, Mitch Baker and Thea Wyndham are given joint custody of the couple's three children. Thea declines and, naturally, Mitch is upset. He has always had a thing for her and can't understand why she is behaving this way. On the other hand, he has a good support system and has always enjoyed being around the children so his decision is somewhat easier to make.At the beginning of this story, each is romantically involved with another person. Long story short and trying not to give away spoilers, this couple's relationship grows slowly. If you have read any of my other reviews regarding this author there is no insta-sex but when it finally happens it borders on erotic.My guess is that those 30 and older would appreciate this romance most. If you have children you will understand better why the main characters have their moments. There is no big misunderstanding but each has a few times where you'd like to say, \"Really? You want to leave it like that?\" and knock their heads.I am giving it four stars because of the realism of the subject line. Too often the hero and heroine meet, they have sex, there is the hated 'Big Misunderstanding', yada-yada-yada, they realize they love each other and we have the HEA. You WON'T find that here. If, after reading this story and you enjoyed it, you may want to look for contemporary romances by Theresa Weir. Her main characters also have depth, are not perfect, there are moments of angst and the hero and heroine have to work for a HEA. In other words, the stories have meat and it is something I like."}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "Thoroughly enjoyable contemporary romance between two people who never thought they'd end up being instant parents to the orphaned children of their respective best friends.

I keep trying though, because I feel that the writing is well-done, clean.Even though this novel is well written, it's not plotted well. It's TERRIBLY boring. I've had an incredibly stressful couple of weeks and I wanted an easy-going read to take my mind off of real life. I should've chosen something rigorous and exciting, because this book certainly wasn't the relaxing read I wanted. It bored me to tears.There is no real conflict for this couple. Their pairing was inevitable from the beginning. The rest was a slow sentimental trudge to the end. Also, what's with Goodman's characterizations? It seems to me that all of her characters have these incredibly heinous pasts. This main character was abused, dragged out of a loving foster home into a cold and heartless environment only to end up severely addicted to pills. Yet, this backstory was not a true conflict in the storyline because she had already acknowledged her addiction. She just had to learn confidence or trust or something. This was all just so depressing and tiresome filler.About 90% through the book I found myself just wishing it was over. Then there was a STUPID misunderstanding (one of my romance novel pet peeves), so I started skimming through.

Both combined in this story to make a satisfying read. I really enjoyed the children in the story and would have liked to see a bit more. The slow unveiling of Thea's past was well done. I thought the character was amazingly effective, compassionate, and strong; especially when it became clear what kind of horrible upbringing she had. Mitch was a great character also.

The writing was well textured, intelligent, often humorous and allowed me to fall into and luxuriate in the story.I have always hated stories where the H/H meet and are so suddenly in love/lust that they obsessing over each others' eyes and lips incessantly. Likewise I tend to stay far away stories that have a fairytale quality where the hero swoops in and sets everything right for the heroine through either mega-bucks or a mega-muscles. This book is none of those things. Mitch and Thea's relationship builds slowly and grows through simple things like conversation, revelation and even necessity.They are initially thrown together through the shared guardianship of three children whose parents recently died. Thea was best lifelong friends with Gabe (the father) while Matt was best friends with Kate (the mother). They have known each other for years as satellites who orbited the married pair and are known affectionately as 'Uncle Mitch' and 'Aunt Thea' to the kids. However as the book begins Mitch and Thea are testily, and with some hostility, meeting in their lawyers' office trying to figure out how custody should work.Thea and Mitch are both great characters but I really enjoyed how Thea's character played out and was revealed. With Mitch what see is what you get. He is a political cartoonist who comes from a very stable, loving family. He is funny, irreverent and never met a double entendre he didn't like. His dialogue with Thea and the kids is often peppered with funny asides and witty observations. He is set up as the fun 'uncle' who is way over his head when he has to take physical custody of the kids and yet he gamely tries his best. He hides his fears and uncertainties behind his wisecracks. He's a guy with a capital 'G' sometimes and that means he can be a bit insensitive sometimes. But he's good people under it all.Thea, otoh, is a deeper pool altogether. While a lot of the book centers on the burgeoning love between her and Mitch and the ways they gel into becoming a unit for the kids, a big bit of the book is also concerned with revealing who Thea is. Her character, past and personality unfolds slowly and the reader gradually begins to understand things that are only hinted at early in the book. I really liked Thea and I think the author sold the character and all her flaws very well without making them seem insurmountable.The book also contains several great supporting characters including Mitch and Thea's significant others -- Gina and Joel, respectively. When the book begins Thea is engaged to Joel while Mitch is involved with Gina. Both of these characters are thrown for a loop when their partners suddenly find themselves in loco parentis of three young children. It is not something either of them signed up for and both of them struggle with it. To the author's credit she did not vilify either of these two. As a matter of fact they remain part of the book through the end, well after Mitch and Thea are deeply involved. You understand that decent people like Mitch and Thea got involved with people just as decent as themselves. And that former lovers can remain close friends.The kids were also great, not too cutesy or cloying. Or...shudder...wise beyond their years. They hit the right note for kids who should be five and eleven years old.One final aspect of the book I liked is that it took place in and around Pittsburgh. The cover suggests some sleepy small town, and while Mitch does live in a older suburb, the flavor of small town living isn't in the book. This isn't to say I hate small towns, it is just that books seem over-saturated with them, so I always notice and LOVE when a book is set in an bigger city. Thea is the head of an advertising agency her family founded. Many of the scenes take place in her workplace so in addition to the domestic drama you get a good, strong sense of Thea's working life as well. There are also key scenes that take place around Pittsburgh as well.I really, really like this book and hopes this author intends to write more contemporaries."}, {"userName": "Tayler K", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/999914-tayler-k", "userReview": "I don't think I'll ever actually read this, I just wanted to save it because of the cover.

Barely polite acquaintances, at that. Something about Mitch's forthright intensity has always left ad exec Thea feeling off-balance, while Mitch makes no secret of his disdain when Thea offers him financial assistance if he'll take sole guardianship. Thea is far from heartless. She's just plain terrified of her new parenting responsibilities. Both she and Mitch are romantically involved with other people. Yet the more time they spend together, the less certain she is of her loyalties. There are complications and mis-steps, tears and laughter - lots of it. And somehow, through it all, the dawning realization that the last place she thought she'd find herself could be just where she belongs.What kind of co-parents and guardians do you get when you ask two friends who apparently don\u2019t get along, are of the opposite gender, and happen to already in steady relationships? This is the situation that Thea Wyndham and Mitchell Baker find themselves in. At the time they agreed to be guardians for their friends Gabe and Kathy, they never imagined that this vital married couple would die, together in a common accident, leaving behind two young children. Mitch and Thea both have busy, separate lives. Now they are forced to make concessions and work together to care for and raise two exceptionally smart kids and not kill each other while doing it. Thea is engaged to an older man, with grown, married children, and no wish to be raising a new generation. He wants to be able to say \u201cThea let\u2019s take the plane and fly off for a weekend getaway\u201d.

With a room full of lawyers, and differing viewpoints, somehow they must work together and provide a safe and cherishing environment for eleven year old Emily and her twin brother Case. This will definitely be a battle of wits and patience. I enjoyed this book on so many levels. I grew up in a single parent house, my mother worked in the family business and I spent a lot of time on my own (a 1950\u2019s latchkey kid). Seeing how the twins react to the loss of both parents and being dropped into the home of their \u201cUncle\u201d Mitch, is in a way similar to my mother\u2019s remarrying and my being saddled with two very much younger step siblings. It\u2019s the getting used to new people, new family and a new home.

I must say I was cautious, knowing how much I enjoy her writing but unsure as to how that would translate into a contemporary setting. My concerns were needless, Ms. Goodman easily brings her wonderful, emotional story-telling to a modern day setting.Thea Wyndham has suffered a tremendous shock. After learning her childhood friend and his wife were killed by a drunk driver, Thea then finds out she, along with Mitch Baker, has been named guardian of their three children. Thea is unprepared to become a parent to the children and makes this clear to Mitch. At first she comes off as cold and distant, showing only glimpses of her concern for the children. Thea's mothering instincts had been buried deep which made me want to know why. She's not cruel but has her shields up and defenses at full strength.If you must appoint a guardian for your children, Mitch Baker is a great choice. He doesn't have kids of his own, in fact his experience with kids is with his friends children. But he embraces his guardianship even though inside he is terrified of making a mistake. Mitch is nearly perfect in his parenting, with only one real mistake. I kept wondering when his mask would slip and we would see the real person behind the perfection but it never really did. I would have liked to see him less than perfect since his perfection only served to spotlighted Thea's flaws.The romance is balanced with the growing relationship between Mitch, Thea and the children. You really couldn't have the romance without including the children since they are the reason for Mitch and Thea to be together. I do think it's fair to say the romance wasn't always front and but character development apart from each other also occurred. There are other people in their lives that impact not only the relationships with the children but also how Thea and Mitch proceed with their growing feelings. Goodman handles it well, showing how each of the characters perspectives change and grow.The ending didn't come as a surprise but getting there was filled with a complex romance that showed not only how two people can come together but can create a new family out of a tragedy. The main problem I had was Mitch's perfection, since flawed characters are so much more interesting. There was also the odd romance from two secondary characters. What made it odd is that it didn't add much to the overall story. I felt it was unnecessary to the main plot and found I cared little for either character. Otherwise, I enjoyed this contemporary romance from Ms. Goodman and will read any more contemporaries she writes."}, {"userName": "The Book Worm", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43115903-the-book-worm", "userReview": "A Place Called Home is a sweet, heartwarming romance novel. Mitch and Thea accepted to be godparents to their best friends Gabe and Kathy's children without giving it much thought. They always made sure they were present in the kids' lives but never really expected to be called to fulfill their duties as replacement parents. When Gabe and Kathy pass away unexpectedly in a car accident, Mitch and Thea find themselves with the hard task of having to raise eleven year old Emilie and five year old twins Case and Grant. Together.At the time the story starts, Mitch is single, but dating a younger woman who seems to love the children but resents the fact that they take away too much time and they barely manage to have an evening for themselves anymore (welcome to parenthood!). Thea is engaged to be married to an older man, with adult children of his own and no interest whatsoever in raising someone else's children. I confess that the initial pages of the book made me really angry because I kept feeling sorry for the poor kids who lost their parents and then seem to be unwanted by both Thea and Mitch. As the story progressed, though, Mitch redeemed himself in the best way possible, and I came to perfectly understand Thea's reasons and the difficulties she had to overcome herself. My only complaint about this book is the fact that no-one seems to be concerned with car seats for the twins, which I found odd. My five year old does not ride in a car without a car seat (neither does my eight year old, for that matter), so this was something that really bothered me. It's obviously a small detail that does not affect the story in any way, but I'm picky like that when I read books.In any case, more than the romance between Mitch and Thea, A Place Called Home is a story of acceptance and personal growth. Mitch and Thea have to learn about each other, have to be friends and come together to care for the children. The fact that that friendship ends up to be something more feels like a natural progression of the story. Neither Mitch nor Thea are perfect, they make mistakes as all parents inevitably do, but they love the children and they do their best for them. Nothing is forced, nothing sounds unrealistic and that's why the romance is so believable. It is what makes such a long book so easy to read. And in the end, you'll feel just as happy as the characters when they get their much deserved happily ever after.

I know I have liked every book she has written although I will admit to liking some better than others. With all that being said, I was prepared to dislike this book. I thought the story had been told and retold often enough, shoot.. Diane Keaton had even made a movie about a similar concept. It didn\u2019t matter that Jo Goodman was a favorite author, she was writing out of her style (she traditionally does historical works) and she was writing a well written story.. So it didn\u2019t stand a chance, UNTIL I started reading. Ok, for the first four or five pages I admit to having a closed mind and thinking.. yeah this isn\u2019t gonna work. Then suddenly I turned the page and I was finished reading..************************************************Together they go about life as many single parent households do. There was no magic in this book, no dragons or vampires, no scottish highlanders arriving in kilts. There was no evil darkness hunting them or some maniac trying to kill them.. No, the magic of this book was the pure romance.. A man and a woman finding each other, learning about each other and making the other a better person. And that is a powerful magic indeed. In a way this book was more dangerous to the reader than any work of fantasy can be.. All we have to do is close our eyes and we can see what Thea and Mitch are discovering. We live their lives every day, we go to work, we take our kids to school, we fight with our loved ones.. We have interfering parents and nosy friends... Ms Goodman shows her gift by being able to make life itself magic.. All the little steps that we do every day, changing the cacophony of noise in our lives into a symphony of delight.While I sincerely hope Ms Goodman goes back to her historical romances that I love, I honestly believe that this might have been her best book ever.To Read the review in it's entirety come to Bodice Rippers"}, {"userName": "Addictive", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4001944-addictive", "userReview": "It was a delight to read Jo Goodman\u2019s latest A Place Called Home. When I initially read the summary I was thinking of that movie with Heigl and Duhamel with the same script and I was both scared and excited to read it. Scared because while the movie was funny, it didn\u2019t grab me and pull me in like this book did. \tA Place Called Home has a man\u2019s man like Duhamel in Mitchell Baker who when the story sets out already has had the kids for about a month before Thea Wyndam comes into the picture. Mitchell is trying to be a father figure in that he sets up a cussing jar and even buys a kid friendly vehicle, but his girlfriend Gina who he has been going out with believes it is only a matter a time before the kids move in with Thea and they are gone from their lives. But it is Gina who leaves Mitchell\u2019s life when Thea turns down full custody of the kids and opts to visitation rights.\tThea Wyndam is not your typical workaholic. It\u2019s not that she hates kids; it\u2019s just that she\u2019s terrified of being a role model. Thea has problems that spring up on you while reading and surprise you, the problems are real, and not uncommon. At the start of Goodman\u2019s latest, Thea is made out to be a hard nose woman with only an interest in the family business and proving to her father that she can lead the company. But as the story progresses and we meet the kids and delve deeper into each characters issue\u2019s we see that Thea is actually a kind, misunderstood woman who would love to be a mother but because of her addictions is predictably scared.\tJo Goodman has blended together a story of laughter, sorrow, empathy, and heartbreak. A Place Called Home is vastly different from the above mentioned movie and I am heartily glad for that. Whenever I put down a book with a smile and sigh, longing for a continuation I have to recommend it to everyone out there who loves a good, wholesome, comforting read."}, {"userName": "Amy Lignor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6259268-amy-lignor", "userReview": "Whether it is historical, western, or contemporary, it is always a romance that a reader will never forget when USA Today Bestselling Author, Jo Goodman writes a tale. She is one of those very few imaginative storyteller\u2019s that can have readers at \u2018hello.\u2019 This new story offers readers not only romance, but a creative and emotional blend of family, love, friends, and the forces of fate can do to another. In this particular story, the main characters of Thea Wyndham and Mitchell Baker are told that they have become \u2018joint\u2019 guardians of their late friends\u2019 three children. Not exactly an easy task, seeing as that these people are not married or dating each other - heck, they barely know each other - and what they do know of each other makes them want to run in the opposite direction and NOT take care of children as a \u2018team.\u2019Mitch is one of these strong characters who will not take help from anyone. No matter what happens or appears in his life, he wants to find a way to take care of things all by himself, and Thea has a tendency to offer aid and financial assistance which makes him go absolutely nuts. Thea soon finds that she is completely and utterly frightened to take over the task of raising these children. Not only that, but she has to be friends and partners with Mitch, and both of them are already in relationships with other people who may just not understand why they would possibly take up this responsibility. Readers will be able to share in the spectrum of human emotions - literally - with this incredibly funny, warm and caring tale. They will watch as two people who live in completely different worlds seem to find a point where they not only work well together, but they also WANT to work together for a very long time to come. The plot offers humor, drama, romance - absolutely everything a reader could ask for!"}, {"userName": "LoveRomance", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2333242-loveromance", "userReview": "What an awesome surprise. The night before vacation I went through my library's e-book collection to get a few \"back-up\" books in case I went through all of the ebooks I purchased. This book was one I added without really thinking about it, had forgotten about it on vacation, and just yesterday started it because I had nothing else to read. And I loved it!The characters were fully developed. The balance of story, romance and sex was perfect. The tragedy that starts the book doesn't define the whole story, and the author allowed for happiness and joy and grief to happen as they likely would if a situation like this were happening IRL. My only gripe is that the character Thea, who is just out of rehab for painkiller addiction and suffered tremendous abouse as a child, overcomes her fears and embraces life in such a short period of time. That just didn't seem realistic. And even with my limited experience with AA and NA, I know one guiding principle is to not get deeply involved in a personal intimate relationship until at least one year of sobriety. While circumstances in the plot may have moved Thea's romance along, it was odd that this \"wait until your stable\" principle never came up, even from her sponsor Rosie (a secondary character I otherwise enjoyed very much). The author did a good job of portraying just how hard it was for Thea in the days and weeks post-rehab, but didn't really seem to embrace the NA philosophy (apart from the 90 meetings in 90 days).Overall I really enjoyed this story and will look for more titles by this author. That I got this from my library for free is an added bonus."}], "description": "When Thea Wyndham and Mitchell Baker learn they've been named joint guardians for their late friends' three children, they're little more than acquaintances. Barely polite acquaintances, at that. Something about Mitch's forthright intensity has always left ad exec Thea feeling off-balance, while Mitch makes no secret of his disdain when Thea offers him financial assistance if he'll take sole guardianship.Thea is far from heartless. She's just plain terrified of her new parenting responsibilities. Both she and Mitch are romantically involved with other people. Yet the more time they spend together, the less certain she is of her loyalties. There are complications and missteps, tears and laughter--lots of it. And somehow, through it all, the dawning realization that the last place she thought she'd find herself could be just where she belongs. . .Praise for Jo Goodman's Marry Me\"Fans of historical and western romance will appreciate Goodman's witty dialogue, first-rate narrative prose and clever plotting.\" -Publishers Weekly (starred review)\"An insightful, gently sensual love story.\" -Library Journal", "title": "A Place Called Home", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10431175-a-place-called-home", "average": 3.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327896606l/10431175.jpg", "reviews": 94, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/39691.Jo_Goodman", "name": "Jo Goodman"}], "type": ["Romance", "Romance", "Contemporary", "Fiction", "Family"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10431175-a-place-called-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12475736-a-place-called-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12429920-a-place-called-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18668058-in-want-of-a-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3576953-the-price-of-desire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8883236-marry-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/614467.If_His_Kiss_Is_Wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6437838-never-love-a-lawman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11781578-lover-s-leap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable"]}
