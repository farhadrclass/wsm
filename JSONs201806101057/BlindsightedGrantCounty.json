While I obviously knew \"who did it\" this go around, it was really a special experience that allowed me to soak up the wonderful characters and marinate in all the feels from these fine southern folks that I haven't spent time with in many moons. Clearly the first go around I was more focused on picking up clues and solving the crime, but this time felt different; it was laid back and easygoing. Gone was the urgent, rushed sense of devouring the book (not that there's anything wrong with urgently devouring books), and I was able to experience things from a completely new perspective. Maybe as I grow older I appreciate the fine details, the exquisite style of writing, and the author's talented way of drawing me completely into the story, but I found myself just as gripped by the plot without any of the tension or pressure to fly through and \"move on to the next one\".Obviously the central case was graphic, both violently and sexually, so it won't be for everyone, but I was so pleased that it remained a concrete 5 stars for me without all the flashy twists blowing my mind from the first go around. If you are looking for top notch characterization in your crime thrillers, you really can't do any better than Karin Slaughter. It's like the woman lives in a different world than we do and sees things I overlook on a daily basis; the tiny details are what really set these stories apart from others in the genre. I know so many people are die hard fans of the Will Trent series, but if you skipped ahead without reading Grant County first I urgently insist that you backtrack and take the time to experience where it all started. There's a tight knit feel in these first 6 books that I have yet to find anywhere else, which is one of many reasons why this series will be one of my all time favorites. Sara + Jeffrey = my favorite couple ever. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f**************************A reread for me, but with all these arcs piling up around me I felt I needed to pick up a book that is sentimental and just for me, one with no expectations that I already know I love. I'm really pumped to start this series from the beginning again, as it's one of my all time favorites, and I'm hoping to write a proper review this go around. \u2764\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "Well after reading BLINDSIGHTED I now consider myself to be a full-blown KARIN SLAUGHTER fan! This is only the second book I have read by her and the first book in her Grant County Series which I thoroughly enjoyed. So this definitely will not be my last and I think that I will probably find myself binge reading the rest of the books in this series.BLINDSIGHTED by KARIN SLAUGHTER is a gritty, edgy, engrossing, and suspenseful mystery / thriller that had me interested enough to turn those pages as fast as I could.Trigger warning as this author does go into some graphic detail that might be disturbing for some.The novel kept me interested and guessing with the right amount of clues as the mystery gradually unfolded to the very exciting ending. Although, there was nothing real surprising with the reveal it is the storyline and the way that the author delivers this story is what grabbed my attention and made this book such a good read for me. To sum it all up it was an entertaining, disturbing, exciting, tense, fast-paced, and a quick read with a very satisfying ending.

It definitely felt like a first effort. (Not that I could do better if I was to try). So, 3 stars for Blindsighted.The plot was riveting and held my interest. At times, it was very extreme (if fictional violence against women bothers you STAY AWAY), but if you can handle the extreme, the details make it all the more suspenseful.I felt a bit like some of the plot elements and twists were forced. Even though it is supposed to be a mystery until the end, and while I didn't know why it all happebed until the end, I felt like the way it was written the \"who\" was pretty obvious early on.Looks like this was released in 2001 and some of the elements are definitely specific to the time period. Music choices, mention of having something on tape, etc. Just kind of an interesting side note.I am looking forward to trying another as I am sure she hones her craft as she goes on. But, again, this is not too bad of a first effort."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Blindsighted by Karin Slaughter is a 2015 Harper publication. This is the first book in the Grant County series, which was originally published way back in 2002. I have read this book before, a long time ago, before Goodreads had even launched. However, I decided to start the Grant County series over, despite having read a few of them already. It\u2019s a long story, but basically, I got some of the Grant County books mixed up with the Will Trent series, which caused a great deal of confusion, for me, which is something I did a lot until GR came along to help me organize my books and before I recieved valuable hints and suggestions from other readers. So, although I know how things work out for some of the characters in future installments, I want to understand the full story, and refresh my memory about a few things before I continue with the Trent series. Sara is a pediatrician and works part time as a coroner. The part time work puts her directly in contact with her ex-husband, Jeffrey, a man she has a complicated history with and with whom she still carries a torch. But, when Jeffrey\u2019s deputy, Lena, loses her sister in a very violent way, it stirs up bad memories for Sara and forces her to work up close and personal with her Jeffrey while they try to put a killer behind bars. This is a very gritty crime thriller with some pretty gruesome and lurid descriptions, which is certainly not for the faint of heart. There\u2019s also some fantastic personal interactions, some of which nearly choked me up. Wow. I had forgotten how good this book was!  It has perfect pacing, well-timed twists, and in -depth characterizations that are very rare for a \u2018first in a series\u2019 novel, and of course, let\u2019s not forget that stunning shocker at the end!! Although this book was written fifteen years ago, it stands up well to the test of time and blew me away, even knowing all I know now. So, if you have started the Will Trent series without reading this series first, I still recommend picking these up. If you haven\u2019t read Will Trent yet, I STRONGLY urge you to read the Grant County books first because it will really help you understand the backstories that crossover into the Trent series later. 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "Blindsighted: Karin Slaughter's first Sara Linton novelAnd the publishers announce:First there was Patricia Cornwell!\nTHEN there was Kathy Reichs!\nNOW GET READY FOR KARIN SLAUGHTER!\nKarin SlaughterWelcome to Grant County, Georgia. Don't look for it on a Georgia map. It isn't there. And in this fictional County, there's a fictional town. It's a small town called Heartsdale, somewhere around Madison, but before you hit Augusta.Eddie Linton and Daughters is a plumbing company in town. But it should be Linton and Daughter. Tessa works with her father. Sara grew up and went to medical school and became a pediatrician. After medical school Sara returns home and takes over the town medical clinic. The nearest hospital is in Augusta. She married Jeff Tolliver, the County Sheriff, but divorced him after he cheated on her with the town sign painter. Life's complicated when your Ex is the Sheriff and you're not only the town's pediatrician, but also the County Coroner. You bump into your Ex a lot more than you might like. Actually, Jeff wouldn't mind patching things up. After all, he only had that affair because he wanted Sara to need him as much as he needed her. Uh-huh. What? Could this be a new genre? \"Crimance?\"Sara definitely doesn't want Jeff back in her life. She's dated the town pharmacist, Jeb, off and on. It hasn't been anything serious. Sara really doesn't have the time.Things turn nasty when Sara has lunch with her sister Tessa down at Pete's Diner. She steps into the bathroom to wash her hands and finds herself in the middle of a crime scene. Sybil Adams is sitting on the john. Someone has carved a cross into her. Sybil dies in convulsions in Sara's arms as she bleeds out on the bathroom floor.From whence does the title come? Why, from Belladonna from the Italian meaning \"beautiful woman.\" Traditionally the plant was used to cause dilation of the pupils to make a woman appear more seductive. Use too much of the stuff, you become so sensitive to light you can see nothing, and it's a powerful hallucinogenic, causing paralysis, loss of memory, and convulsions.\nBelladonaSybil was blind. Hmmm...in Roman mythology Sybil was a \"Seeress.\" Well, maybe it was just a coincidental choice and not an attempt at irony. She was a professor at the small college. She was also a lesbian. Was it a hate crime? More conflict rises because her sister Lena is one of Sheriff Tolliver's Detectives. She's out to find her own justice for her sister's death.Sara's autopsy reveals that Sybil was also raped and sodomized. A second victim is found draped across Sarah's car. She had been crucified in x form, and repeatedly raped and sodomized. She was also stabbed. Sara prevents her death by cracking her chest and massaging her heart. When this young woman begins to tell of her experience, Jeff realizes he's got an escalating serial rapist/killer on his hands.Slaughter relentlessly turns up the pace when Jeff's detective Lena, Sibyl's sister is the next woman to disappear. Slaughter has the ability to keep you flipping the pages to see what happens next.Could Sara be the next victim, Jeff worries. Can he find his missing detective?Blindsighted is a decent series debut. Karin Slaughter has sold a gazillion books. The book blurbs glow.BUT: I wish I could have liked this book more. The herrings herein are very, very, red. There's the homophobic doper. And a ridiculous stab at an incident of token racism, when some townsmen assume that an aged black man musta dun it. OH, PLEASE! C'MON!I anticipated the identity of the perp long before the end. While on the surface of things, Sara appears proficient in her forensic skills, she is a pediatrician, not a pathologist. If Sara ever makes it to court, it wouldn't be pretty. Oh. Dang. Spoiler alert: If the perp never survives, you don't have to worry about witness qualification. And, by the way, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has a death investigation division with either four to five regional laboratories staffed with pathologists. Georgia uses a Medical Examiner System. The Coroner calls for an autopsy, but bodies are transported to the labs for the autopsies. Now, I do understand that six Georgia counties are not covered by GBI, so considering Grant County is fictional anyway, well, heck this is a work of fiction. Interestingly, Slaughter also refers to Sara as a medical examiner in one paragraph in which she also calls her a coroner.I'm jaded. Twenty-eight years in a District Attorney's Office will do that to you. If you think I'm too hard in my assessment of Karin Slaughter, don't get me started on John Grisham. D.A. does NOT stand for dumb ass, Mr. Grisham. One thing I must acknowledge. Karin Slaughter has the dynamics of rape and men who rape down with great accuracy. For the dialogue, pacing, and that knowledge, I give this 3.5 our of five stars.Having said all that, of course I already have the second book in the series.

Her world is filled with interesting characters, personal drama and a fair share of deranged individuals. I did enjoy the book. The writing was very good, the characters were interesting and the plot was good. That said, it seemed to be missing something. Something I am having a hard time putting my finger on. For all the positives, the story still lacks. Plot summary The story shifts through three major points of view. Sara, the town's coroner and a pediatrician. Jeffery, the ex-husband of Sara and the town's chief of police and Lena, a deputy on the force and sister of the first victim. The story opens with the murder of Lena's sister. Sara finds her body in restaurant washroom where she has been killed and brutalized. Unfortunately, this is not last body as others go missing and crimes contain similar ritualistic elements. As the story progresses as the crimes become personal for all parties involved and secrets from the past may hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of the murders. The Good  Well Crafted This was one well crafted novel. This was nominated the Barry Award for Best First Novel and it was certainly good enough to have won it. Karin Slaughter wrote a book that was taunt, thrilling and as polished as those with much more experience. There was an interesting storyline with red herrings, misdirection and slight of hand. While the beginning of the novel lagged, the pace picked up significantly in the middle of the bookThere was significant drama amongst the characters. While I despise excessive romance in my novels and roll my eyes when the story becomes overly emotional, the author deftly walked the line on this point. There are complex relationships each with their own histories and developments. The Bad  But Its Missing Something... Despite all of the positive elements, the novel did not feel complete. Despite a good storyline, good character development and thrills and chills, the story may have been a victim of its own slick execution. While I enjoyed the story and was interested in the outcome, I did not connect with the characters. By the end, I was interested to see if my theories were correct but I did not care about the characters. While the body of the novel was solid and looked good, the lacked some soul Final Thoughts A slow first half and a lack of soul and emotion hurt my rating on this one. That said, it is an excellent and well crafted first novel. Karin Slaughter has had a long and successful career and I am confident that her skill improved as she gained experience. Overall, a worthwhile read but not one that I will list amongst my favorites.  Content Advisories  It is difficult to find commentary on the sex/violence/language content of book if you are interested. I make an effort to give you the information so you can make an informed decision before reading. *Disclaimer* I do not take note or count the occurrences of adult language as I read. I am simply giving approximations.Scale 1 - Lowest 5 - Highest Sex  -  3.5 Much of the sexual content is related to a series of sex crimes. There is one moderately graphic scene of a sexual assault. There are several more far more disturbing elements are revealed in the investigation of sexual assaults. There is some disturbing sodomy involved and other elements that are violent. Language  -  3 There is moderate use of mild obscenities and low usage of the f-word. There is also some low use of sexual derived adult language. Violence  -  4 There are some disturbing elements of violence in the novel (see sexual content). There are some moderately high graphic description of the violence. There are some ritualistic elements in the violence amongst multiple murders. Readers who are moderately sensitive to sexual violence should avoid this book."}, {"userName": "Ray Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4877068-ray-daniel", "userReview": "I hardly every rank a book with five stars.

The crimeSarah goes to the local diner for lunch with her sister. She's a little late and the lunch crowd is pretty much gone. When she goes to the restroom, she finds Sibyl Adams, a professor at the local college who is also blind, covered in blood in one of the stalls. She's been brutally stabbed and assaulted and Sarah tries but can't save her. During the autopsy, she discovers just how demented her killer really is. The issuesThere's quite a bit of inbreeding in this town. Sibyl was Detective Lena Adam's sister and she's difficult to deal with under good circumstances. She insists on being part of the investigation and Jeffrey doesn't have a deep investigative bench to keep her on the sidelines. When another woman is assaulted in a similar manner, it's clear that they've got a possible serial killer to deal with. The mystery and suspenseThere are a lot of angles, including an overlay of bigotry and insubordination amongst the police ranks. Jeffrey is also trying to get back into Sarah's life while trying to work with her to solve the cases. She's withholding some major stuff that could possibly impact the case but doesn't want to revisit her troubled past. When a third person goes missing, it strikes even closer to home. The bottom lineThis is the first book in the series and it is chilling. All those involved in the case, while talented, have some major issues in their personal lives that resurface throughout the course of the investigation. That just made the story even more exciting and frustrating. It wasn't all that easy to figure out whodunit but it wasn't impossible either. If this first book is a measure of those to come, I'm in for an incredible journey. The book is not without its flaws but they're not significant enough to detract from your overall enjoyment.

Our main character was more scared than I could believe considering she's the coroner and dead bodies aren't foreign to her. I believed the shock she felt when she first saw the body, because you're not expecting something like that ever, but after that all her nerves were just annoying to me. Or how she was cradling the victim when the cop came, as if she were really close to this person, but she wasn't, so why the forehead stroking and all that? The guy has been a cop for TWENTY years, and the first half had been spent in a place where murders weren't uncommon (he says not a week went by without investigating one), yet when he learns of this new murder he freaks out. He says how it literally takes his breath away when he sees the scene, and at one point gets lightheaded when the CORONER has to point out the murder is probably not a simple murder, but in the next fricken sentence he's thinking how he's seen that kind of thing before. And this gem: \"\"What?\" He asked, his voice echoing slightly on the cellular.\" What the fuck is that?! Where's the finesse and superb writing that made Pretty Girls so unputdownable?! UGH. Another cop, but at least this one had an actual personal connection to the murder victim, is searching for anything that could help shed light on who did it, and she's looking for the diary, but it's in braille since the victim was blind, and as the victim's lover picks it up to translate it the cop thinks: \"For some reason, Lena got the impression she was touching the pages because [the victim] had, as if she could absorb some sense of [the victim] rather than just words.\" For. Some. Reason. Ok. This book does not read like Slaughter's Pretty Girls at all. I had zero complaints for Pretty Girls, but I can't even bring myself to finish this one. The only thing I like about it is that it's about adults and not teens and a ritualistic-ish murder plot would have been great to read about.

Needless to say, I have become pretty much Slaughter obsessed. Chelsea, my good pal over at The Suspense Is Thrilling Me, suggested I go way back and start with the first book in the Grant County series, Blindsighted and, man oh man, am I happy I decided to do that. The first novel introduces us to the characters in the small Georgia town of Grant County where a professor is found brutally murdered and defiled in a publish washroom. Found by town pediatrician and medical examiner, Sara Linton, upon further investigation into the corpse it is discovered how sick and twisted this case truly is. Sara\u2019s ex-husband, police chief Jeffery Tolliver is leading the case and, when another local woman is found crucified days later, the entire town is on edge. Slaughter brilliantly is able to weave a tale that is gruesome, macabre and completely entertaining. Once I started reading this book, I found that I could not put it down. I was entranced with her writing and completely caught up with the happenings in Grant County. I loved the characters in this one; the tangled romantic relationship between Jeffery and Sara added another level of interest to the plot and the added character of Lena, the town\u2019s first female detective and also the first victim\u2019s sister, on her own vigilante mission added yet another layer. Slaughter\u2019s characterization is clearly her strong suit and I cannot wait to see how these characters will develop in the upcoming novels to this series. I have already picked up the second book in the series, Kisscut, which from my understanding, is even better! 5/5 stars. I absolutely believe any thriller fan would love this book."}, {"userName": "Sandra ~ \u2665 Cross My Heart \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17716247-sandra-cross-my-heart", "userReview": "Dark, emotional, heart-pounding book...not for the faint of heart but definitely a Page Burner!

I read this book after reading Cop town and Pretty Girls and now I am hooked. Slaughter has quickly become one of my favorite mystery writers. She is a gritty and intelligent writer. I love the research she puts into her books. Having a background in Forensics, I really appreciate her books and the research she puts into this.In Blindsighted, a professor is found murdered in a restaurant. Her Murder hits very close to home to Sara, who is the town's Pediatrician and Coroner. It is also Sara who discovers the body. The professor turns out to the twin sister of a police officer who works for Sara's ex-husband, Jeffrey.Will Sara's past hold the key to solving this case? What will happen between her and her ex-husband Jeffrey?As stated above, I love Slaughter's attention to detail. I love the police work involved, the investigations, the forensics, even the autopsies are well done in this book. But mostly, I love the relationships between the characters. I love the love story between Sara and Jeffrey. Just enough is told to make me like them both. To get me involved in their history and continued story. Plus, well there is a killer on the loose. Who is it. Will there be more victims? Will the police save the day?I'll never tell.

This time around I listened to it on my I-pod and enjoyed it every bit as much as the first read.Karin Slaughter is an accomplished author who has never disappointed me.This is the first of her Grant County series, in which we meet paediatrician and coroner Sarah Linton and her ex husband, Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver. Sarah reminds me a little of myself - fiercely independent and more than a little prickly. She is an incredibly strong woman, yet also very vulnerable. And she doesn't like asking for help or admitting that she may have a weakness......Jeffrey is still very much in love with Sarah, and when she reveals a little of herself to him, he barges in to \"Fix\" it, rather than reassuring her. (Men - take note here!)I am making this sound more of a love story than it is.....for it is a story of grisly murder, one that appears to begin with the grisly murder of a local college professor, a blind woman and sister of the county's one and only female detective on Tolliver's force, but in reality started long before this particular murder.Strongly recommended."}, {"userName": "Tammy Walton Grant", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3047961-tammy-walton-grant", "userReview": "3.5 stars I think this is the second book by Karin Slaughter that I have sat down and read straight through.For a forensic-type thriller I enjoyed it. Slaughter has thought up some pretty gruesome twists on a serial rapist/murderer plot, and I liked Tolliver, the chief of police, quite a bit. I also liked Sara Linton, the other main character. She is the coroner and also Tolliver's ex-wife. The tension get ratcheted up early on, and Slaughter keeps it up until the end. I only flipped ahead to see who did it ONCE, which is high praise from someone like me (I suffer from book ADD, lol)I had a couple of problems with this book, though -- mostly to do with the way the series is being set up. The author seems to have glossed over a couple of really important details in the character development at the beginning and then drops them in (WHAM!) later on in the book. I'm not a big fan of that style, mostly because I spend the first half of the book thinking I've missed something. If there was foreshadowing going on I missed it. That's the feeling that I got with most of the book - like you'd gotten dropped into town on Main Street, by sheer happenstance on the day there is a gory, nasty murder in the diner. You don't know anyone, you don't understand the dynamics of their relationships (and they are ALL related somehow) and you're left fumbling around for half the book until author lets us in on what's happened.She seems to be being deliberately vague on some aspects of the main characters, when I think if she'd let you in on them you'd care a little more about her people. Maybe she's holding back - there are at least 6 books in this series, I think. There was a storyline from the beginning that just seemed to get dropped and never picked up again. On the same day as the murder (main plot point) happens, Sara Linton, (a pediatrician at her day job) has just gotten word that one of her patients has terminal cancer. We get a few paragraphs about how hard this is going to be for her, how she has to set up an appointment with the family to give them the diagnosis, she thinks about the little boy (who, she thinks, has the largest Matchbox or Hot Wheels car collection she personally has ever seen) and reflects on the fact that in a year he'd probably be dead. She has the appointment with the family just before the briefing with the police on the murder, AND WE NEVER HEAR ANOTHER THING ABOUT THAT FAMILY AGAIN. What was the point? If it's a red herring it's a pretty stupid one, if you ask me. There were a few things like that that bugged me about the book.Overall, though, I'm invested enough to read the second book to see where Karin Slaughter takes me next. I'd recommend it for those who like police/forensic procedurals, with a smidge of romance thrown in."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4731410-lauren", "userReview": "[the fact that he uses Belladonna makes him the only viable suspect (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Lynne Davis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22937637-lynne-davis", "userReview": "Excellent suspense thriller and debut novel of Karin Slaughter.

It's hard to excuse such glaring errors in a book in which a main character is supposed to be a physician and also a coroner. As an example, despite the dramatic pronouncement of the supposed expert on the drug (\"There's no known antidote.\"), atropine (belladonna) DOES have an antidote (and the science of these types of nerve agents are well known, like Physiology 101 stuff) and person hospitalized for atropine intoxication would certainly be given the antidote (scopalomine). I'm not even a doctor, but even I remember this from a physiology class I took 20 years ago! Likewise, \"partial hysterectomies\" are NOT the treatment for the issue that Sara faced. That's just dumb. And so on. Those are just the immediate examples that come to mind.... Ugh!  LATER: Well, I finished the book. Found it to be a decent, if fairly typical, female doctor-cop-or-lawyer-in-peril sort of plot. The characters were well-fleshed out and each had convincing backstories. But, in the end, as a reader I am left thinking, WHY should all of these things have occurred? Or, perhaps, why NOW? A very odd collection of crimes, clues and possible motives, etc., that seem convincing enough as you are reading them. But now, mulling over the book in its entirety, it seems like there are quite a few holes in the story. The medical and forensic mistakes being just the smallest of these. These holes are why I downgraded what would have been a solid three-star rating to two stars instead. A promising writer, this author, but she's GOT to either do her research better OR at least get a smarter editor to catch these things. Perhaps I'm being harsh, but in this day and age, practically anyone with a tv has learned at least some basic criminology from one \"procedural\" show or other. So, if an author is going to involve forensics in a book, he or she had BETTER get their facts straight! That's just basic competency in the genre and not too much to expect, I think. Apparently this book is now the first of a series. Perhaps I'll give it one more try with book 2 at some point in the future.
