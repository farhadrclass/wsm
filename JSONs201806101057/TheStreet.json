They're only doing the same thing in Europe that's been done in this country since the time it started.\nSince a grand jury ruled that Daniel Pantaleo should not be indicted for the murder of Eric Garner, a murder committed via an unlawful chokehold that was deemed a homicide and published as a Youtube video a day later, I've been doing some reconfiguring with the help of myriad Tumblr posts cause fuck mainstream media. I'll pay heed instead to a post describing the systematic invalidation of the concept of collective trauma suffered by black people as a result of racism by a high school teacher; a teacher who went on right after to academically delight in the woeful tale of a white boy traumatized by his mother killing a chicken in front of him. I'll keep in mind that every authoritative text written on philosophy and psychology and epistemology by a white man, sometimes poor and sometimes not straight but usually with very little variation in characteristics, is simply that. The text of a white man. In this world of ours, such texts taken as \"universal\" and \"standard\" and everything vaguely sadistic in them excused because of the \"times\" result in a US twenty dollar bill with a genocidal pasty bag of dicks plastered in the circle of honor. Cause, y'know, he was a president.\nHe could have killed her easy and no one would even have rapped on the door, and he wondered what went on inside these other apartments to make their occupants so incurious.\nI may perhaps be mislabeling this piece as \"Dickensian\" because it's been a long time since I last read him and the author doesn't rhapsodize or stereotype or flounder around for the Redemption of the Little White Straight Man, but what I remember most about his reputation is he being a crusader for the poor. Crusader's a horrible term for it when you look at the historical context, but nonetheless I will compare Petry and this book of hers to him because it is on par with Native Son in terms of the socioeconomic ramifications of anti-blackness and even better because black women get more consideration than a girlfriend in a refrigerator. It's not as good as Beloved, but it is evident that this work, published in 1944, was a powerful forebearer.\nThe glitter on the screen did nothing to dispel her sense of panic. She kept thinking it had nothing to do with her, because there were no dirty little rooms, no narrow, crowded streets, no children with police records, no worries about rent and gas bills.\nIf all thinking by white women gets clumped together under the simplistic and far too often dismissive \"feminist\" label and thinking by non-white men gets the civil rights/Oriental kicker, thinking by non-white women is barely a poof in the hallowed halls of Endless Reference. This work is not Ain\u2019t I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism, but it's a damn good place of fiction to start. Much like Larsen, Petry cuts to the bone with a few sentences and puts the rest of the works that take at least ten pages to parse their point to neverending shame. Anti-blackness from the perspective of a white woman? Check. Black male misgogyny? Check. White male misogyny/racism? Check. Black woman internalized misogyny? Check. White person sadism/suicide as an inevitable result of their indoctrinated shutting off of empathy in favor of money? Check, check, a myriad of multifarious characters each getting their psychological due in their various places as accorded by anti-blackness, US North New York New York Harlem style.\nStreets like the one she lived on were no accident. They were the North's lynch mobs, she thought bitterly; the method the big cities used to keep Negroes in their place.\nDon't forget the economic imbalance that will exist so long as capitalists need the homeless to feel better about themselves.\nI\u2019d sell anything I\u2019ve got without stopping to think about it twice, because I don\u2019t intend to learn how to crawl again.\nViolence and looting don't solve anything unless you worship the US military and choose to ignore that all your \"beautiful holidays\" and tree-lighting is built on centuries of one country razing another in pursuit of said loot.\nShe held the paper in her hand for a long time, trying to follow the reasoning by which that thin ragged boy had become in the eyes of a reporter a 'burly Negro.' And she decided that it all depended on where you sat how these things looked. If you looked at them from inside the framework of a fat weekly salary, and you thought of colored people as naturally criminal, then you didn't really see what any Negro looked like. You couldn't, because the Negro was never an individual. He was a threat, or an animal, or a curse, or a blight, or a joke.\nP.S. This book doesn't mince around the idea of sex and has one of the best endings ever, if your incentive for reading tends more towards the literary than the humanitarian."}, {"userName": "Ij", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4341680-ij", "userReview": "The Street to Lutie Johnson meant 116th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, New York City. For those who don\u2019t know, that\u2019s Harlem. Lutie is looking here for an apartment for her and her son Bub. She wants her own apartment away from her Pop, where she believed Lil her Pop\u2019s current live-in girlfriend is a bad influence to Bub.The apartment in question is a fourth floor walkup with dark narrow hallways, located in the back of the building. There is a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom. Bub will have to sleep on the sofa. She did not care much for the Super, Mr. Jones, who showed her the apartment or for the nosey neighbor, Mrs. Hedges, who had her head sticking out her first floor window, when Lutie had arrived. But at twenty-nine fifty ($29.50) a month at least she would be getting her eight (8) year old away from Pop\u2019s place.The Street was a big change for Lutie who had at one time had her own house with her husband Jim. But things did not work out when Lutie became the sole provider for the family. She had to take a job as a live-in maid in Connecticut and was only able to come home twice a month to her husband and son. Lutie was a high school graduate but it was the only job she could find, at the time. Her husband could find no job. Much later, after receiving a call from her Pop, Lutie came home to find Jim with another women. Jim was not apologetic and Lutie took Bub and moved in with Pop. Lutie took the civil service exam and was able to get a lower level government job. She was ambitious and thought she could move up and do better for her and Bub. After paying rent she did not have much left over and must abide by a strict budget.The Super had wanted Lutie from the time he first saw her and vowed to himself to win her over. The Super currently lived, on the first floor, with a woman named Min, who he lost interest in the minute he first saw Lutie. Mrs. Hedges had eyes on Lutie for a man that she knew, \u201ca nice white gentleman.\u201d Bud went from coming home to an undesirable environment, to coming home to an empty apartment, on The Street. Lutie was convinced that she was doing better and would continue to make advancements, if they could just keep on their budget and she could save money. She kept expressing this to Bub.The Super thinks that if he can get rid of Min, that he can get Lutie. So he decides that he will put her out. Min feels that she is at risk and visits the Prophet David, a root doctor. After Min explains her problem to Prophet David he gave a red liquid to put in the Super\u2019s coffee, two candles to burn, some power to spread around for protection, and a cross. He also told her to make sure the house was cleaned well. Ten dollars please. Prophet David said he could not do anything about Lutie, but, that Min would not get put out. It is amazing how things change with a confidence boost. Min went home knowing that she would not be put out. And she wasn\u2019t. Lutie spurges one evening and goes to a bar (Junto Bar and Grill). After a few beers she is feeling good and singing loud with the music. She has a good voice and gets noticed. One of the persons that notices her was Boots Smith, another is Old Man Junto, \u201ca nice white gentleman.\u201d Boots tell Lutie she can make money singing with his band. She is excited with the possibility. The plan is for her to tryout, with his band, the next night. Lutie is a hit with the band and the patrons. Lutie had been warned about men, by her grandmother. She knows that Boots wants more than to help her. But she waits till the second night to ask about her salary. In the meantime, Old Man Junto had summoned Boots and told him he wanted Lutie for himself and not to offer her a salary. Old Man Junto owned both the bar and grill and the club where Boots\u2019 band played. Lutie leaves the club on the second night after hearing that she won\u2019t get paid, because the Old Man says she is not ready. Mrs. Hedges has also told the Super to stay away from Lutie. It turns out the Old Man also owns the apartment building.The Super is PISSED. He can\u2019t have Lutie and for some reason is scared to put Min out. He believes that Lutie has turned him down and is messing around with Old Man Junto. He tries to think of a way to get back at her. He decides to get Bub in trouble. Bub gets arrested from a scheme designed and put in place by the Super. Lutie finds an attorney and he agrees to get Bub out of trouble, but, it will cost her two hundred dollars.She has no idea where to get this money. She finally thinks of Boots who she believes will loan it to her. Of course, Boots gets Old Man Junto involved. When Lutie goes to Boots\u2019 apartment to get the loan he has promised her she sees the Old Man. Boots takes her in the bedroom to explain. She wants no part of this and screams for Boots to get the Old Man out of there. Boots thinks this is his opportunity to have Lutie than give her to the Old Man. It does not work out that way. After the Old Man leaves Boots tries to force himself on Lutie. He smacks her several times in the face. Lutie is fast enough to grab an iron candlestick. The candlestick proves harder than Boots\u2019 skull.Now, Lutie believes she has murdered Boots. She takes money out of his wallet for Bub\u2019s attorney. Then after removing the door key from his pocket leaves to go to the attorney. It comes to her that she will probably be known as an unfit mother for murdering Boots. Who would release Bub to an unfit mother? Lutie thinks that Bub will be better off without her. Lutie take the money and takes a train to Chicago. She thinks that Bub will have a better chance by going to reform school.The story is about race, gender and class. This is a debut novel for Ann Petry, first published in 1946. There are many conflicts, twists, and turns. In the end, Lutie had talked to Bub so much about money that he ended up trying to get money by helping the Super who had actually tricked him into thinking he was helping to catch crooks."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "The street could motivate or obliterate. The street could consume and devour. Here, the street is a personified stronghold; dreams come alive or they burn because of the street.Sometimes I start the first few pages of a book and realize immediately that it will have a treasured rating on my physical and goodreads shelves. Sometimes, after the finality, I sit in silence and thumb the highlighted pages of my copy, flipping again through its contents physically and mentally, attempting to pinpoint its uniqueness, allowing myself to once again become consumed by the singularity of a particular book. The measured movement of the words in this novel captivates, rhythm forming a parallel with a meaningful plot of heartbreak and pain. Her voice had a thin thread of sadness running through it that made the song important, that made it tell a story that wasn't in the words - a story of despair, of loneliness, of frustration.Listen to the tunes of a young, black, immigrant woman who moves to New York City to work and support a husband and child in Jamaica; hear a refrain of disloyalty and toil, a stanza of child rearing and long hours of work in a place where the neighbors are the worst enemies; notice the repeated hook of a torturous street that can't be avoided when it is all a person can afford; what you'll hear is a melancholic hymn of a dream displaced. She had come this far poor and black and shut out as though a door had been slammed in her face. Well, she would shove it open; she would beat and bang on it and push against it and use a chisel in order to get it open. I suspect Petry became the first black woman to sell more than a million copies of a novel not because she wrote like the Richard Wrights before her, but because she did not. From these words, the real portrait of a hard-working segment of women rarely illuminated emerges, and if you've ever spent a few years in inner-city New York, huddled in a small apartment, fearful of spending too much time on the street, you understand Lutie's despair over her son. Dirty, dark, filthy traps. Upstairs. Downstairs. In my lady's chamber. Click goes the trap when you pay the first month's rent. Walk right in. It's a free country. Dark little hallways. Stinking toilets.I read Petry and I see the words of Buchi Emecheta and Fumiko Enchi. I see the Lutie Johnsons of this world who must balance long work hours with proper childcare and in the interim, be classified as bad mothers. I see the women who must escape the prison of prostitution that looms around them. I see unmarried mothers engaged in the struggle to get paid equally so that they too can manage their households. I see the women who raise men. I see women of the city who spend hours getting from home to work and back, women whose children lose their childhoods, those women who can never seem to find their way out of the poverty cycle. I read Petry and I see the street more clearly."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1856764-kristen", "userReview": "I haven't felt so mindfucked from an ending since Bend Sinister. Yet, whereas Nabokov does it simply because he can, in The Street it serves to underline the message, and I would say message rather than plot because Petry was a political writer and this novel certainly is that, besides being a wonderful piece of fiction. Some books shouldn't have happy endings, life in 1940's Harlem as a single mother didn't often have a happy ending and some types of books should just completely break you because maybe it wouldn't get through otherwise. In Petry\u2019s novel the characters are not simply good or bad, they are just people acting according to the natural, logical consequences of their conditions, the result of genocidal economics in action. Yet even the character Junto, who comes to embody the crudest kind of predatory capitalism, much in the way Ben Harrison embodies dickface trolling, is still a pawn in the social/economic conditions of which he is largely unaware. I see Petry often compared to Richard Wright and there is certainly a compassion to be made with this novel and Native Son, yet for me as much as I did understand what Wright was saying and the significance of his protagonist becoming a murderer on a rational level, I just never really bought it as a narrative, Petry I buy, and based on this novel I say she is far more talented than Wright (best Wright story=The Man Who Lived Underground) The paradox of Lutie's very resistance to the pressures of the unrelenting ontological angst of living in such dehumanizing conditions leading her to commit a horrendous act is illuminated in a way Wright never captured. My only complaint of this novel is the noticeable lack of unicorns."}, {"userName": "Faith", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith", "userReview": "This book treats, with unflinching clarity, the poverty, racism and sexism that trap the young black woman Lutie Johnson. Her husband is unable to find work so she takes a job as a maid in the suburbs. This separates her from her husband and son for weeks at a time, leading to the destruction of the marriage. She and her 8 year old son Bub wind up living in the only apartment she can afford on 116th Street in Harlem. Every step Ludie takes to pull herself up is thwarted by her color, her lack of money and by men who surround her like a pack of dogs slobbering over their prey. Things do not go well for her or Bub. Whether in Harlem in the 1940s, Paris in the late 18th century (as depicted by Emile Zola in \"The Gin Palace\") or today, sometimes it is just not possible to escape your circumstances. This book was very sad, but quite realistic and wonderfully written. I listened to the audio book and the narrator Shayna Small was excellent, however some idiot producer decided that it would be a good idea to insert random and poorly-executed sound effects like doors slamming, dogs snoring, doorbells, trains etc. They really cheapened the experience."}, {"userName": "Zanna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna", "userReview": "Lutie Johnson does everything 'right'. She works hard, struggles to save, puts her son first, tries to protect him from loneliness, discomfort and the influences of the street full of poor, struggling folks. While working for a white family as a live-in housekeeper, she absorbed the philosophy the men espoused \u2013 wealth is available to anyone who works for it in this country. She studies, gets a 'respectable' white collar job, and keeps studying so that she can some day get a piddling promotion. She isn't 'color-struck'. She takes responsibility for her own success (or lack of it), keeps healthy and has an innate store of self-respect. If anyone can pull herself up by her bootstraps, it's Lutie, and for me the most vivid takeaway from this story is that 'bootstraps' theory is a barbed, cruel trap.For Lutie, her family and all tge residents of the street, one weighty materialisation of this trap is RENT. Living in London, I can relate, but the opening of the book in which Lutie contemplates the horrible living conditions she is about to pay such an extortionate price for showed how much uglier the word looms for people trying to make the frayed ends of small salaries and low wages meet. In such grinding poverty conditions, the motivation to seek any kind of hustle is intense, and affects Lutie's eight year old son, who tries to take up shining shoes like other boys on the street.Lutie's description of the division between her and white people as a wall, erected by them, not her, but visible to her, not them, reminded me of Sara Ahmed's work; she often writes about walls that obstruct some bodies and not others. Lutie is baffled by the fact that white women are worried she might have an affair with one of their 'thin unhappy husbands': 'she wondered why they had the idea that all colored girls were whores'. The looks full of contempt and assumptions from white people make her 'never fe[el] human until she reache[s] Harlem'. At the time, formal segregation confined black people to the neighbourhood, though of course, white people own the properties rented out so expensively, as well as the shops. They also take the jobs - one of the voices Petry takes on is that of a disinterested, lazy white teacher who works in a Harlem school, full of hate for her charges, and so ashamed to work in such poor conditions that she keeps her workplace secret. Lutie also sees the neighbourhood as a bad environment, but her attitudes contrast with the white teacher's, who sees black people inherently as the problem. Lutie sees clearly what is wrong: there are no jobs for black men, so the women go out to work in low-paying domestic service, and the men become idle. Why is there no outside work for the men and why don't they take on the burden of house-work and child care? Simple: white supremacist capitalist patriarchy.To broaden the perspective, the other main characters include the superintendant of the building Lutie moves into, who has become malevolent and obsessive from spending too much time living in cellars, and a middle aged domestic service worker who, now that she has found a way of living rent-free, will do almost anything to maintain the situation. These characters have highly developed, idiosyncratic voices; Petry calls them startlingly into being. Mrs Hedges, who sits watching the street and makes an adequate living from the sex workers who make use of her apartment, is a complex, interesting character, seen very differently by Lutie, the super and other people on the street. She is kind and protective, but at times reveals an exploitative attitude to other people that is reflected in her unfeeling eyes.Lutie's attractiveness, to black men who are meant to be helping her (because they have taken on positions that place this obligation on them) and white men who are gatekeepers to all the exit routes from her oppressive situation, has a huge weight in the narrative. At times I felt this was too important, but I started to question my white feminist perspective, and to think that this was deliberate, not just a prop to make the plot work, but important for two reasons, firstly because the attractiveness of black women is maligned by white supremacist media and advertising, which positions the white woman as the ideal of attractiveness and femininity. Here, Lutie is considered beautiful by everyone, and desired by black and white men, belying the trope. Secondly, white supremacist capitalist patriarchy defines how Lutie's attractiveness will function; men long to own her body, and constantly leverage their different forms of power over her to try to fulfil their desire. The reflection 'she wondered why they had the idea that all colored girls were whores' becomes increasingly ironic as the constantly arising pressures, created by the actions or complicity of those whites, pushing Lutie into sex work stack up.As well as being of great social and political import, this novel was nearly impossible for me to put down, despite its simple plot. I just had to know what would happen next. If I were writing the blurb I'd call it 'compulsive and compulsory'."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/419287-jessica", "userReview": "I'm hesitant to give this four stars for a couple of reasons: one, because I know it was flawed in certain important ways, but to me the stars have to do with how much I personally enjoyed a book, not how technically \"good\" it was, so I think that's okay. The main reason I'm afraid of singing this book's praises too loudly is that I really loved it, and being able to see its problems and knowing other people might not think it's good really hurts my feelings. I feel protective of this book, and it upsets me to think about other people maligning it. So please don't read this unless you're going to like it!The Street is Ann Petry's 1946 novel about single mother Lutie Johnson's efforts to raise her son and escape poverty while living on 116h Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues in Harlem. Young, black, beautiful, poor, and socially isolated, Lutie is constantly and acutely aware of the ways in which her existence and her son's future are limited and crushed by the forces of racism and class. I am sure that today's college students really freak out about this book for its sophisticated mid-twentieth-century examination of the paradigm of intersectionality: race! class! gender! It's all here, in this artfully structured novel that moves easily among the perspectives of a handful of the Street's denizens. I found the characters in this book to be brilliantly crafted. Petry has us see through the eyes not just of Lutie but of her eight-year-old son; their malevolent, predatory, mentally-deranged super; the super's pathetic, oppressed, but resilient companion; the building's massive and fire-scarred, red-kerchiefed madam; and other characters whose individuality comes to life, even as Petry lends them each the dignity of her distinctive and -- I thought -- quite beautiful voice. That's really hard to do, and this book accomplished it. The characters make decisions and behave in ways that are often strange, morally questionable, or undoubtably wrong, but the author successfully makes them so human that we understand their reasoning and can't fully judge them.The Street suffered from two major problems: one, social novel syndrome, by which I mean that Petry's obvious efforts to show the effects of racism and injustice on individuals' lives did often overwhelm the story and get too annoyingly obvious. Every page has Lutie's meditations on the the effects of racism, poverty, and segregated urban slums, and it did get tiresome and undermined the book's power. But a lot of this might have been due to its other flaw, first novel syndrome: The Street was Petry's first book, and it has many marks of that including unnecessary repetition, a failure at crucial points to trust the reader, and what I thought was a hasty, melodramatic, and unbelievable ending. I'm definitely interested in reading Petry's other books to see what she was like when she matured more as a writer. Her gifts of character and description are, I thought, sensational. I can picture Lutie's apartment, the building, and her street nearly as vividly as I can see my own, and all the characters were as physically and nearly as psychologically real to me as the people I encounter in daily life. Since few books can convey a physical environment to me so well, I really found this to be special.I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in a depiction of Harlem in the days before drugs (on a wide scale), guns, housing projects, white gentrification, and extensive social services and welfare benefits. I'm pretty familiar with the neighborhood she's talking about, and it was very interesting to see how things have and have not changed since the 1940s. This is one of the better novels I've read about Black American urban life in the pre-Civil-Rights era, and I might recommend it for that to some parties. But the real reason I thought The Street was so good was on its merits as a work of fiction. While I know the social novel stuff could turn off a lot of readers, I felt the same delight from this as from a good children's storybook -- a very disturbing, upsetting children's storybook with a lot of sex and violence and human suffering. But it almost seemed illustrated, that's how vivid it was. I will definitely be reading more by Ann Petry and I'll recommend this book despite my concerns, though if you think it's bad I don't really want to hear about it."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "A phenomenal story. \"The street\" itself is actually one of the novel's main characters, taking on a life of its own throughout the story. As noted on page 323 in Lutie Johnson's thoughts, referring to her Harlem ghetto neighborhood,\"Streets like the one she lived on were no accident. They were the North's lynch mobs...the methods the big cities used to keep Negroes in their place.\" (323) Not only that, but \"and while you were out working to pay the rent on this stinking, rotten place, why, the street outside played nursemaid to your kid. It became both mother and father and trained your kid for you, and it was an evil father and a vicious mother...\" (407).I won't go through the plot here, because it is so eloquently summarized by others here and elsewhere on the internet, but throughout the book, the street took on a life of its own, providing the impetus for Lutie's actions. All she wanted was her little slice of the American dream for herself and her son, but the more she attempted to leave the street behind her, the more it hemmed her in. And outside the street existed factors that put and kept people in the street: unemployment, racism and distrust, economic oppression. This book is a very gritty and unapologetic look at the Harlem ghetto of the 1940s, and I think one of the most revealing scenes (meaning one that really struck me) in this novel was that in which the Harlem schoolteacher's thoughts were laid bare. You kind of have to wonder how far we've actually come from the world portrayed in this book -- the issues here are largely still relevant. The Street is not a happy, feel-good type of novel, so if that's what you want, then skip it. This book really got under my skin and I know it's one I'll think about for some time. It's also one I'd recommend to anyone, and would list under the \"don't miss this book\" category. The writing is most excellent; the reader can actually envision the streets filled with rubbish, the squalidness of the apartments, and can feel the total anguish that Lutie felt throughout the story. The characterizations are excellent as well.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Lulu", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8427052-lulu", "userReview": "This book was published over 60 ago. 60 years ago, a single black mother in Harlem had the same exact heartaches that a single black mother in the United States is having right now.

All three tell a tale of a young black person and their struggle to achieve more. All three were written in the same era. All three are heartbreaking and haunting. I've loved all three, but each stands out for its own reason. The Street stands apart from the other two because Petry's story is so much more than a story of ethnicity; it's equally a tale about the struggles of women, and more so it's the sad plight of anyone who lives in poverty. Ellison wrote masterful scenes and Wright created a voice impossible to forget, but Petry succeeded writing a story that was immensely universal.The Street is the story of Lutie Johnson. Lutie worries about money and image, she worries about her young son and dreams about her full potential. Lutie's struggles are ones many of us face, even today. Lutie's very insightful and intelligent, but otherwise she's not much different than your average person struggling to make ends meet. Her tale is tragic not so much because of the complexion of her skin, but because of \u201cthe street\u201d and all it entails. Petry had ample opportunity to deride capitalism and make this a political book, but unlike Wright she let the story speak for itself, let the reader decide what is right and wrong with the picture.Petry wrote wonderfully, and her characters were phenomenal. She expertly developed them, handing out unique voices to each, capturing accurate portrayals regardless of age or gender. Though this is the story of Lutie, Petry rotated through many perspectives, delving into the struggles of others while propelling the primary plot further.Unfortunately, compared to her contemporaries, Petry is largely unknown today. Both Ellison and Wright are widely taught in high schools and universities, but Petry is not. Her talents did not outweigh her male counterparts, but they certainly rivaled them. And given the more universal message of The Street, I would think it must have more appeal to instructors of young people. I anticipate a Petry renaissance in the coming years; I'd love to read more of her work."}, {"userName": "Lisa Reads & Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5395843-lisa-reads-reviews", "userReview": "[Lifted from Wiki] Ann Petry (1908-1997) was the first black woman writer with book sales topping a million copies. She was raised sheltered from most of the disadvantages other black people in the United States had to experience due to the color of their skin.Now, I'll quote from Wiki directly:\"Petry had a strong family foundation with well-traveled uncles, who had many stories to tell her when coming home; her father, who overcame racial obstacles, opened a pharmacy in the small town; and her mother and aunts set a strong example: Petry, interviewed by the Washington Post in 1992, says about her tough female family members that \u201cit never occurred to them that there were things they couldn\u2019t do because they were women.\u201dIf our society could purge ourselves of racism and sexism, everyone would have the opportunity to enrich the world instead of having to spend their lives struggling under hate and prejudice. Petry was lucky. Her light was allowed to shine. Imagine how rich our world would be if everyone's talents were nurtured. The novel is excellent on multiple levels; characters, craft, plot, etc are all polished and enthralling. Its message is important, too, especially in these times. Empathy is needed these days. The story unflinchingly describes how prejudice breeds hate and violence on all sides. Some incidents are subtle and burn slowly, others are like fire to gasoline. Walking a mile in another person's shoes, even if the path is outlined in a novel, can lead to understanding, and perhaps better actions. I highly recommend this novel."}, {"userName": "Misshaq", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4564467-misshaq", "userReview": "I received this book as a gift from my grandmother. She wrote a small note in the insert of the book that says she read this book when she was 16 (she is now 78) because she grew up in Harlem near 116th street where this story takes place. The Street is about a woman name Lutie Johnson-young,smart,strong willed and determined to rise above the poverty and racism that constrains her on a daily basis. After an unsuccessful youthful marriage, she becomes a single woman raising her son in Harlem 1950s. Lutie is also extraordinarily beautiful. In her case, her beauty worked against her causing jealousy among the women (white and black alike) and unhealthy and dangerous obsessions among the men of all races. Lutie is unable to make ends meet and live the quality life that she sees her white counterparts living. The book has a very sad ending that I won't give away in case you want to read it. The author, Ann Petry takes the reader right into the world she describes. You get an understanding of what life was like for black people back then, post World War II, how the men dealt with unemployment and what that did to their psyche's, how it impacted their women, who had to go out to work and how that in turned impacted the children and the communities. I found myself rooting for Lutie and wondering how she would fare in modern times.

Both are about poor folks, and both are wonderfully geographically specific, but Tree Grows is terribly sentimental, and The Street is...not. The lady version of Native Son wouldn't be the worst way to describe it.\"The men stood around and the women worked,\" is Petry's thesis. \"The men left the women and the women went on working and the kids were left alone.\" And \"the women work because for years now the white folks haven't liked to give black men jobs that paid enough for them to support their families.\" That's a complicated thesis, and I'm in no way qualified to judge how much of a point she's got, but she certainly spends the whole book building a very convincing case. There's a certain Furious Stylesishness to The Street - a didacticism that gets on your nerves a little. It's not that Petry's telling instead of showing - she's showing, too. She's doing a good enough job showing that she could maybe have done away with a little bit of the telling. But it's nowhere near as preachy as Native Son; as a whole novel, you'd really have to say it works better. Here's a Google street view of the exact street this is set on - 116th between 7th and 8th. That block is now super hip and thoroughly gentrified."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4124973-linda", "userReview": "This is the story of Lutie Johnson and her son Bub. They are African Americans living in Harlem, probably sometime in the forties. The characters in this story were extremely well drawn, to the point that you, as the reader, could feel that you were those people and lived where they lived and could smell the street and see the garbage and corruption.Lutie worked and studied very hard in order to try to pull them up out of poverty, but life was against her. African American men were refused jobs that paid a decent wage and the women had to work at menial jobs to support them. The men couldn't take it that their wives did all the working, so eventually marriages broke up. This was just the way it was.Lutie tried to rise up out of that environment. She had dreams of singing and being able to provide properly for Bub, but the rich bosses had all the say.This book is not a thriller, a murder or anything that could be considered high drama. Its just a very honest, day by day account of the life of one girl and her son. It is one of the best insightful books that I have read and would recommend this to anyone wishing to learn more about the history of the people of the Americas."}, {"userName": "FreeFormLady ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44597268-freeformlady", "userReview": "Check out my thoughts by clicking the link belowhttps://youtu.be/FuiWeT6pJjwI have conflicting thoughts on this book.

It's just that with the social commentary books I've read, I almost always encounter one (or more of the following) problems that make it impossible for me to rate the book highly: 1) The integrity of the characters is destroyed by the fact the author values delivering the message more highly than maintaining the aliveness of the characters 2) The message and observations are now quite dated, even if they might have been poignant at the time of publication 3) The author is commenting from a place of privilege; i.e. rich straight white man railing about the injustice of society (well, yes, but should we be amplifying their voice over others?) The Street managed to avoid all of these traps. The characters are real living breathing people; published in the 1940's, the themes are as relevant as ever today; and Ann Petry was a black woman writer who lived in Harlem writing about a young black woman's life in Harlem. Perfect! The Street is just a really skillfully written book, beautifully composed, and it adeptly finds the right balance between elaborating the \"message\" and telling the story of the characters. You really get a feeling for the absolute hopelessness that comes from living in a impoverished black inner-city neighborhood, and the ironclad barriers white society has erected, making it basically impossible for a young black poor single mother to stay afloat or to find any dignity or way to improve her lot in life. The Street is vivid, alive, and compelling. The ending was perfect.

A vivid analysis of race and class injustice in World War II-era New York City framed by the personal account of single mother Lutie Johnson, The Street is as heartbreaking today as it was in 1946, the year of its publication. Petry\u2019s straightforward, omniscient style of writing is a perfect complement to the story, communicating its tragic message with unflinching clarity. At the forefront of Petry\u2019s novel is the street itself, both its physical presence and the metaphor it refers to. The opening pages of the novel personify the street as a violent, dangerous place, inspiring a sense of foreboding that permeates throughout the rest of the book. This dire prediction proves true as the metaphor of the street comes to represent the cycle of tragedy that results from one\u2019s simply being born African-American and the impoverished socioeconomic status that follows. Lutie Johnson and the cast of characters surrounding her on 116th street in Harlem each experience the hazardous effects of the cycle: young people marry to escape their broken childhood environments; the husbands are unable to find work, forcing the wives to become the breadwinners via degrading service jobs; the husbands, no longer to provide for their families seek validation elsewhere, usually by way of alcohol and/or extramarital affairs; the couples separate, leaving the wives to raise the children and therefore triggering another revolution of the cycle. The tragedy of The Street is found in Lutie\u2019s failure to end the cycle for her beloved eight-year-old son Bub, despite her hard-fought attempt.One of Petry\u2019s greatest achievements in this novel is her success in portraying each character as an individual; there are no caricatures in The Street. Mrs. Hedges, the procuress of a brothel on the first floor of Lutie\u2019s apartment building is someone who can easily be interpreted as a cold, desensitized madam. However, Petry adds depth to the character as she artfully integrates Mrs. Hedges's personal struggle to achieve success after she escapes from a fire that permanently disfigures her body. Once privy to her personal story the reader unconsciously elevates her from stock character to sympathetic individual.A similar humanization is achieved for Jones, the building\u2019s ominous superintendent. Jones is regularly described by his apartment-dwellers as somewhat feral, leering at women on the street, lurking in the shadows and most comfortable in the building\u2019s dark, dank cellar. Petry, however, assures her readers that Jones was not rendered this way without reason. Years of working as a night watchman in confining basements, the only job he could secure, have reduced him to this savage, subhuman state. While Jones\u2019s actions never inspire sympathy, simply having an understanding of his background reveals the fact that Jones was never provided with a fair opportunity to become much of anything else.Though it holds an underappreciated position in the literary canon, The Street will certainly be remembered best for its severe realism. The Street is not a novel easily read in large doses. The street Petry describes is so vividly brutal that the act of reading about it is often uncomfortable. However, the beauty of Petry\u2019s writing and the realism of the world she creates is so striking that the book is difficult to put down.Ann Petry\u2019s magnum opus The Street took me by surprise. I began reading it with the understanding that it was a close relative of Richard Wright\u2019s wonderful classic Native Son. The Street, however, is a classic in its own right and I look forward to sharing my discovery of it with others."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/273240-nicole", "userReview": "The Street, by Ann Petry, is one of my all-time favorite books. Sometimes I find I have a physical relationship to the object of a book, and this is a paramount example.In college, I volunteered at a books for prisoners program, where we would package books per prisoner's requests. Aside from the delightful (and perhaps naive, or at least simplistic) joy of hoping that books could address the systemic oppression and human toll that is prison (and the crimes that put people there), I got to handle books. Cast-off books, old textbooks, an alarming number of cheesy westers and musty action books, collections of radical liberal books whose owners would be inclined to give to a books for prisoners program.The copy of The Street, a kind of yellowy orange, over an inch thick with a good binding, stood out in my mind. I could never grab it to ship it away, and many times looked at its cover image of a woman in a dilapidated building looking over a dilapidated street--her eyes somehow not quite right. It's a pretty dated image, all 1970s font, but something about that book just kept my attention.Years later, when the books for prisoners program had matured into a public policy organization advocating for the building of fewer prisons, and more sound policies on everything from mandatory minimums to parole revocations, I was graduating from college and offered a job. One of my tasks was to move the books and their industrial library shelvng from the church basement into our second-story offices (no elevators). After my work-study student and I were thouroughly exhausted, The Street was still there.It was around this time that I heard, on the local radio station where I was a DJ for many years, a piece on Ann Petry, whom I knew to be author of The Street. (I heard this piece on Whats the Word [http://http://www.mla.org/radio], the utterly nerd-tastic, and profoundly delightful, radio program put out by the Modern Language Association.) The next day I asked to take The Street home, and the rest is history.The Street focus on Lutie Johnson, a young black woman trying to make ends meet against a backdrop of brutal institutional racism and mutual exploitation in 1940s Harlem. Comparable to works by Zora Neale Hurston, whose work I also enjoy tremendously, Petry is a master of location, able to make a tiny, dingy apartment with walls painted colors Lutie hates feel just as hot and stuffy and impossible to escape as Lutie's situation is. Published in 1946, this book is a great example of devices I see used frequently (and well) in modern fiction--such as multiple narrators and slightly non-linear time. It is a crushing book, absolutely infurating and seething with injustice, loss and heartache akin to Khaled Hosseni's contemporay novels, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns."}, {"userName": "Nathan Wisnoski", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5964946-nathan-wisnoski", "userReview": "I hesitate to give this 5 stars because of all the 5-star ratings I've been doling out recently, but I can't help myself\u2014it's stuck with me for the past few days since I've finished the book and I'm still thinking about the ending...Petry is obviously writing with a purpose here\u2014it's a novel about a poor, black, single mother in Harlem and was published in 1946\u2014but she also succeeds in crafting a heart-wrenching story that does not suffer at the hands of her message.Lutie Johnson may be the protagonist here, but the busiest character in the novel is 116th Street, itself. While Lutie and Bub, her son, struggle to make ends meet in the face of racism, sexism, and poverty, the street\u2014marvelously personified throughout the entire novel, especially in its opening pages\u2014is busy holding Lutie back, thwarting her every attempt to escape from captivity. With the help of a few seedy inhabitants, 116th street assembles an all-star crew intent on breaking Lutie's strong will.What elevates this novel to more than just a 'good story' is the manner in which Petry unfolds the narrative. The Street is told from a variety of different perspectives, often in a non-linear fashion, allowing for characters to possess conflicting interpretations of identical events, which greatly contributes to the reader's grasp of the growing tension in the novel. Additionally, it gives some insight to how a few relatively insignificant actions can add up to a devastating finale brought on by unnecessary events.There's a reason this novel still holds its relevance nearly 70 years after its publication. This is not just the story of Lutie and Bub, it is universal and timeless. As Lutie notes on occassion, if she weren't experiencing these conditions on 116th Street, she'd be living the same way on another street if it was similarly poor and black. This may be Lutie's plight, but it is applicable to any single mother as she attempts to raise her son amid sexism and racism. Unfortunately, while we've come a long way since the 1940s, there's still too much in this novel that is still applicable. I don't know why The Street isn't mentioned as frequently as Native Son, Their Eyes Were Watching God or The Invisible Man..."}, {"userName": "Meghan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/142598-meghan", "userReview": "\"And it wasn't just this city. It was any city where they set up a line and say black folks stay on this side and white folks on this side, so that the black folks were crammed on top of each other - jammed and packed and forced into the smallest possible space until they were completely cut off from light and air. It was any place where the women had to work to support the families because the men couldn't get jobs and the men got bored and pulled out and the kids were left without proper homes because there was nobody around to put a heart into it. Yes. It was any place where people were so damn poor they didn't have time to do anything but work, and their bodies were the only source of relief from the pressure under which they lived; and where the crowding together made the young girls wise beyond their years.It all added up to the same thing, she decided - white people. She hated them. She would always hate them. She forced herself to stop that train of though. It led nowhere. It was unpleasant.\"\nIt amazes me that there can be such a pervasive opinion in the US that slavery happened in the long-ago past and bears no relation to our current society. Take this book, which takes place in 1944 in Harlem - the great migration post-slavery, from the South to the North, is going on, and black people coming to the North are forced to live in the shittiest neighborhoods and face pervasive everyday racism and have great difficulty finding jobs. Unlike what happens to people from other backgrounds coming to the cities, the institutionalized practice of redlining and segregation based on appearances lasts for generations - you can't assimilate if your skin color means you can't get loans, live in neighborhoods, etc. This is so clearly related to today. Anyway, all this to say that this book is vital and alive and unpleasant to read. It reminded me of the dark moral sense of Patricia Highsmith.

Almost too much realism, I could only take so much at any one sitting. Then, I would have to put it down and only pick it up again later, when I felt ready for more.The descriptive prose and imagery were beautiful; she grips you from the very beginning:There was a cold November wind blowing through 116th Street. It rattled the tops of garbage cans, sucked window shades out through the top of opened windows and set them flapping back against the windows; and it drove most of the people off the street in the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues except for a few hurried pedestrians who bent double in an effort to offer the least possible exposed surface to its violent assault.[\u2026:] Fingering its way along the curb, the wind set the bits of paper to dancing high in the air,\u2026What I found so overwhelming was the hopelessness of it all. There was absolutely no way of overcoming the urban despair, violence and poverty. Lutie was doomed from the start. So much for the Puritan work ethic: you can go anywhere if you just want it bad enough, if you just work hard enough. Lutie disproves this; she is utterly defeated and swallowed up, a victim of her enviornment. The snow fell softly on the street. It muffled sound. It sent people scurrying homeward, so that the street was soon deserted, empty, quiet. And it could have been any street in the city, for the snow laid a delicate film over the sidewalk, over the brick of the tired, old building; gently obscuring the grime and the garbage and the ugliness.Still so pertinent to today's world; to think it was written in 1946!"}, {"userName": "Charles", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7613428-charles", "userReview": "This is a hard book to rate. It's better than 3 stars but not a 4. I would probably give it a 3.5. For the most part it is well-written and the plot moves right along. The protagonist, Lutie Johnson, is believable and likable. The idea behind the plot -- how \"the street\" in poor and predominantly black neighborhoods makes a victim of almost everyone -- is well-handled. The impacts of racism and segregation on African Americans of the period -- \"The Street\" was published in 1946 -- are completely but subtly played out. But the book falls apart at the end as does Lutie. For most of the book, Lutie seems to be a fairly intelligent and competent young woman but in the last 50 pages she makes two mind-blowing and life-altering decisions. Sure, she feels the walls of oppression closing in on her and her son but that doesn't explain why she stopped thinking straight. Of course, those decisions set up the tragic ending. \"The Street\" is a classic and deserves that status for its ability to portray reality, particularly at a time when so much of black urban life was a mystery to white America.

It is concerned with the lives of poor urban African Americans during the 1940s and it provides a gritty, realistic view of their lives. Petry's novel is even more convincing an argument than Wright's, however. Where Wright's work gains power through its almost claustrophobic focus on Bigger, Petry is able to provide the reader with insights into multiple characters on the street, even though her focus is primarily Lutie Johnson. Both novels lead inexorably to violence and hopelessness, but the violence at the conclusion of Petry's novel is far more compelling. Both novels show how inescapable it seems to the protagonists, but Petry shows in so much more detail how Lutie gets to her moment of violence than Wright is able to show of Bigger's trip to violence. Furthermore, Wright's novel is not only a novel of political import because of its representation of the life of a poor young black man and the inequities of the justice system; it is also a political novel in the sense of promoting a particular political viewpoint. As a result, the final third of the novel tends toward preachiness when the socialist lawyer stands up to defend Bigger. Petry avoids this because her goal is not to provide a solution; her goal is instead to show how pitiless, merciless, inhuman streets like the one Lutie lives on are and to show how this situation plays out for a particular set of individuals but also how it is continuously playing out for all the many, many people on all the many, many streets just like this one. Finally, Petry's novel is able to represent a portion of humanity that Wright's is not: women. Particularly black women. The women of Native Son are incidental to Bigger's experience and primarily function as his victims. But Petry's novel centers on women's experiences without leaving out the struggles that men face. In the end, Petry's novel is less about women's experiences or men's experiences but about both and about the ways in which they affect each other. The Street is as much about social spaces and social constructs as it is about individuals. It is about the way that family, for instance, and community affects the individual. I don't make these comparisons to diminish the impact of Native Son, which is a great novel and one I teach regularly. But the two novels, even though they deal with the same kind of setting, the same class of people, and the same basic situation, do so in different ways. For a truly realistic view of the time period and the issues urban African Americans of this class faced, I would put the two books together. Native Son is a politically charged melodrama with one star performance; The Street is a highly detailed drama with an amazing ensemble cast.I would highly recommend The Street as a document of racism, sexism, and the failings of the American Dream. I would teach it, too, in any semester where I could dedicate the proper amount of time to it. At over 400 densely detailed pages, it is not a fast read. For that is the final thing that is to be admired about Ann Petry's novel. From the first page of the book (actually, from the title), the setting is just as important as the characters, the atmosphere as important as the plot, so skimming is not really an option if you wish to gain the full experience of The Street."}], "description": "The Street tells the poignant, often heartbreaking story of Lutie Johnson, a young black woman, and her spirited struggle to raise her son amid the violence, poverty, and racial dissonance of Harlem in the late 1940s.
