The book started out fairly solid and I was sincerely enjoying that unique perspective, alone. Although, as I kept reading, his interpretation of how a woman speaks, behaves and reacts fell short for me personally. That being said, I give Mr. Veal credit for his noble attempt.This is an age old story of a young college woman, Katelyn, who is swept off her feet by a handsome and chivalrous vampire named, James. He can read her mind and speaks in a 19th century tone that immediately invites the reader in. James is also able to communicate to Katelyn telepathically and the love story that develops between these two is believable and quite enjoyable; at least in the first third of the book. As I kept reading, the connection of these characters took a turn. Their love, their relationship, their life together became unbelievably easy. I kept waiting for something bad to happen to make their togetherness a problem, although, it never came. Maybe I read too many stories with drama and angst, but when you have none, the story teeters on boring. I will say the development of each character was rich and flowed nicely. I enjoyed the history Veal created and appreciated the fact that he took the time to research a specific era of time for each of them. For those reasons alone, I wanted to keep reading. Veal wrote a nice paranormal story and gently takes the reader on a simple yet enjoyable journey. The writing is well done and even steamy at times, but had I beta-read this book, I would have suggested a more authentic voice for Katelyn."}, {"userName": "Airicka Phoenix", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6370441-airicka-phoenix", "userReview": "Let's not mince words, I like mystery and I like vampires, and let's not lie, I love a heroine that kicks serious butt, so to have all the above in a single package? Uh, yeah, sign me up!Before you think this is your average girl meets vampire, fall in love and have little hybrid babies, you'd be wrong. The Master of Whitehall: Katelyn's Chronicles is about 21yrold Katelyn who is trying desperately to forget the past. She moves to South Carolina where she meets James, a smoking hot plantation owner. But there's more to James than she first suspects. He's wealthy, mysterious ... and a vampire. This book reminded me a little of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, which I thought was awesome, because, let's face it, who doesn't love Anne Rice?! There was some hot moments, nothing over the top. The alluring intrigue continued through most of the book. It was a little slow in some parts, but I could easily overlook those as I hurried to see what would become of our lovers.Definite must read!Book gifted by the author.

The nightmare I was having was about the murder of my parents last April....\"This story opens with Katelyn wrapped in nightmares of her parents death. Murdered in their store in Atlanta, she is left trying to cope with this tragedy. Katelyn leaves to go stay with her aunt and uncle in Charleston South Carolina. Its there she goes back to college. While meeting with her new friend Lexi, she meets a mysterious man... James Thomas Dubois, Master of Whitehall Manor.She is interested in him, but overwhelmed by him and her current life. She's still grieving, still adjusting to this new life. After James invites Katelyn and Lexi to visit his splendid home their connection grows and still continues to confuse her. Uneasy feelings including a voice in her head that she can't figure out.James and Katelyn come to an understanding. He can turn her into what he is..but it's now her choice. Will she become like James? He is a vampire after all. He offers her a new life. Can she make this change? Is she willing to die to become reborn as an immortal?Such elegant and descriptive writing. The story makes you feel like you can see Whitehall Manor and the large oaks that line the drive. You can feel the words come to life. The author did a wonderful job capturing the female essence of Katelyn. Well written characters. A twist or two with a lovely backdrop.Will Katelyn allow James to change her? Will the decisions divide them or bring them together? A modern day vampire story with touches of historical overtones. Set in a time and place that still feels like you're going back in time even to this day.An opportunity arises for revenge. Will James let Katelyn take the reins or will he help her avenge her parents death? Bittersweet circumstances that Katelyn must face and more choices to be made. Now that a decision has been reached they must learn to live with these choices.This is the kind of story that makes you wish vampires were real. Then again, how do we know they don't exist? Maybe the author is sharing his secrets with us. I really enjoyed this book. I love how it ended. I look forward to reading more in this series. It was a fun and entertaining book. I live in Louisiana, not far from New Orleans-surely if they exist I may be able to find one there?\"Then he stood, and reaching for my hand, I follow him off the veranda and into the darkness.

The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that the book was well formated and had obviously been copy-edited and proof read. A copy edit is only one kind of edit however, and this book doesn\u2019t appear to have had a structural edit . The line editing, if there had been one, could have been better too for despite the fact that the author showed he could write in some sections, in other sections we had streams of passive writing. The tension between James and Katelyn is good and James's mysterious character is interesting, but the story quickly became bogged down in unnecessary details and so didn't move quickly enough to hold my attention. The characters seem to be developing well, but the story badly needs a structural editor with a large red pen. Here are my notes.Too much back story in ch 2There are too many of Katelyn's thoughts in one clump with nothing actually happening in terms of action, and she is telling us about things that in many cases we can see, or should be able to see from the action. At one point there are 2 pages in italics , and then a massive head hop to a different character and another 2 pages of her thoughts in italics. Then we jump back to the first character again.The dialogue needs cutting back a lot. It includes the kind of things people would say, but that aren't necessary for the story and not particularly interesting, eg long greetings, sharing details of timetables, planning the week ahead and so on. Excessive descriptions eg 5 pages of descriptions of Whitehall. The descriptions are also very passive. There are examples of more immediate writing but mostly it gets lost amongst too many words and repetition of ideas and thought patterns.A lot of unnecessary things in there, even a whole scene on the beach that didn't move the story along.At one point she gives her aunt a long description of her feelings for James and we've just seen that happening, so the conversation is just a repetition.I received this book free of charge from the author in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11520473-melanie", "userReview": "I read The Master of Whitehall by Rick Veal. I recommend this book if you like vampires! This book tells of a vampires' life and events that surround it. It is told from a college girl's perspective, Katelyn. Her parents had just been murdered and she moved in with her Aunt and Uncle in South Carolina. She needed she go back to college for her senior year, so she decides to go to a college not too far away on the coast of SC. She instantly becomes best friends with her roommate, Lexi. Lexi tells her about a man who is a patron for the college who is sitting nearby. His name is James Dubois and he lives at Whitehall, a 1700's plantation. Katelyn is immediately attracted to him. When she begins thinking about how great he looks and would love to meet and do stuff with him, a voice in her head warns her... After a while, James comes to their table and met both the girls. Later he invites Katelyn and Lexi to Whitehall which is very rare to get to see. As times goes on, it is evident that Katelyn and James have a strong connection. James decides he needs to meet with his long time friend Charlotte Ann in New York and discuss something he has for Katelyn. A very big decision that will change her life. James eventually tells Katelyn that he is a vampire and wants her to be his lover and mate for centuries. She has a hard decision to make. She does become his lover and is better for it. She meets different people and does all different things with James' endless supply of money. At the end of the story her best friend Lexi gets horrible news. She spends time with her and finds out she can do something about it. I love that this story is not broken up in different books but tells about James and Katelyn's transformation physically and emotionally. The whole story of James' life is included which is fabulous and Katelyn's grieving about her parents is ended in an extravagant way. I didn't always agree with the way Katelyn thought as a college girl or the way Katelyn didn't care that Charlotte Ann was James' lover for many years, but I accepted it as I read and it made the story smoother. Overall, it was a good read."}, {"userName": "Lynn Worton", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7917492-lynn-worton", "userReview": "This is an intriguing vampire romance that captured my imagination, and is completely unique to any other stories I have read in the past.Katelyn Corbin is a fantastic character. She has had to deal with the brutal murder of her parents, and a gut wrenching move to live with her Aunt and Uncle. She is vulnerable, but has an inner strength that she doesn't realise is there, until she meets James Dubois, the Master of Whitehall. I liked her character very much.Alexis (Lexi) Gordon is Katelyn's new friend at college, and they get on very well. I was going to say like sisters, but these two don't seem to fight like I used to with mine! However, they have a fantastic camaraderie.James Dubois is a fascinating character. Although he's a vampire, he is a quintessential gentleman. He is intrigued with Katelyn and her situation. He decides to get to know her better by inviting her to his plantation house, Whitehall.This is a unique vampire romance. I loved the story, and found myself easily picturing the characters and the settings. The only thing that bothered me slightly was the inner monologues when Katelyn and Lexi first meet; I found them a bit gushing! However, once these monologues were finished, I found myself not able to put the book down! Told from Katelyn's, Lexi's and James's point of view, this story swept me away! There are some other characters that are notable: Charlotte Ann, James's maker, and Dale, a rogue vampire that they meet. Each of these characters have their own story to tell, and it was interesting reading their back stories, and finding out their special talents.As I reached the end of the story, I was struck at how the author had created a family that individually are strong, but together are extremely formidable.Rick Veal has written a heart warming romance. I would be interested in reading more books by this author. There are some scenes of a sensual nature that are a little on the hot side, so I do not recommend this book for younger readers. I do recommend this book if you love paranormal romances with sexy vampires. - Lynn Worton"}, {"userName": "Sara Bree High", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729514-sara-bree-high", "userReview": "The Master of WhitehallRick H. VealReviewed by S. Bree High YATR I want to say first off, kudos to you Mr. Veal\u2026. Not only did he give us one great female character (Katelyn) he wrote two. We had a fabulous secondary character (Lexi) who I adored in this story. I felt he did a great job here. I liked Lexi and felt that her character was a great addition to the story.Vampires and romance this book has both. Our leading lady Katelyn has tragedy. Not just any but brutal, awful tragedy in her life! She has to move from her town to Charleston. She sets out to make a new life, and get over the past. She goes to a new school and she meets James. James Dubois is the owner of Whitehall. James is mesmerizing, and I found myself captivated by him. He speaks at times in the book as if he is from another time, and I got caught up in his words. I think that James had a lonely life and I felt a bit sad for him at times. Although I liked the story with James and Katelyn, I wanted to know what was going to happen. Where were they going to take me? Will the secrets kept be the thing that ends them? Will love be enough?  This was not your typical Vampire and human love story for me. The book is rich in history and well written. It also had a bit of \u201csteam\u201d. It was tastefully done. The book gave us a different story than all the other vampire books out there. I enjoyed it and it was a good read, wonderful love story. My only negative on the story, is I think it could have been shorter. There were a few parts that could have been removed, and the story would have still held merit. Although that does not change the core story for me, and I still enjoyed it overall. I am looking forward to where the story will go, there seemed to be opening for second book and I would be interested in reading the next part of the story. Overall if you want a good love story, with a bit of steam this is the book for you."}, {"userName": "Douglas Meeks", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5970245-douglas-meeks", "userReview": "The Master of Whitehall by Rick H. VealMy rating: 4 of 5 starsFinished the The Master of Whitehall yesterday and enjoyed it a lot. The story is basically a love story within the \"old vampire meets young girl of his dreams\" type scenario which worked quite well. If I had known what I was getting into I might have approached it a bit different mentally since I kept waiting for the always present big \"evil thing\" to appear..... and it never does, quite a shock to many of us who have been reading bloody vampire novels for years. Those of us who have read the Elemental Mysteries cannot help but make comparisons to A Hidden Fire: Elemental Mysteries Book 1 but this novel while enjoyable never reaches the depth of character development in that story but does keep you interested enough to keep reading. At the end of the book you are a bit shocked to find you have been reading a book which is more about friendship and romance with only a touch of the violent world of PNR/UF vampires we have become accustomed to reading. In case I am being too vague I should mention there IS violence and killing but it is FAR from the main thrust of this book. I would have to give this a 4 Star rating and a recommendation of a good book to read when you have had too much of the normal sex and violence that most of our darker PNR/UF novels travel in, this one is more about the light.View all my reviews"}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9574334-tiffany", "userReview": "I came into this thinking I was reading another twilight but boy was I wrong. Katelyn is dealing with a great tragedy, her parents taken away, she's moved with her aunt starting a new school. In her last year of college, thinking about the future what to do with the rest of her life. Kate meets new roommate Lexi, becoming instant bffs. Cut to the first meeting with the master of Whitehall James Dubois, mysterious beautiful gentleman. Kate knows there's something about him, not sure if she should stay away or get to know him. When James meets Kate it's love at first sight.she's the first woman in years he wants to really know him, but has to approach with caution. The more time they spend together makes it obvious they are meant to be. James hints at his real self, Kate wondering if she's ready to know what and who he really is. Kate takes his reveal much better Han expected and she quickly agrees to join him -forever. I love how attentive and caring their relationship is, James is the perfect mate, always thinking ahead giving Kate everything and anything she needs before she even realizes what she needs. Their coupling is fast, but I guess when you know, you just can't pass up that beautiful all consuming love. James teaches her how to be an immortal and we learn about his past and his maker Charlotte Ann. A great addition , she is daring,intriguing, and a little naughty- not always a bad thing. I don't think I ever read such tasteful, sexy time before. Never grotesque or raunchy without becoming the dreaded YA(lol). Dale , a shy inexperienced teen turned against his will, makes for a great partner with Charlotte. His maker's story should be pretty interesting.

Well, I at least like his paranormal books, maybe we shouldn't judge all books by the genre it is lumped in.This book is set in gorgeous South Carolina, and Veal romanticized every little detail of that beautiful city. I want to take a vacation now, no I want to move there now!His descriptions were almost like poetry, fabulous job. His characters are great, even his secondary characters are well fleshed out. Both Katelyn and Lexi are sweet, lovable girls that you could see yourself liking in real life. My heart really went out to Katelyn over her tragedy. She is so determined to start over and move on with her life. This made me see how strong she was, and I love strong females in books.James Dubois is a vampy, and he owns the huge house \"Whitehall.\" (Which again is described beautifully.) He totally mesmerizes Katelyn and pulls her in with his magnetism. He had me under his spell too, those vamps will do that to you.This is different than most vampire love stories I have read before, maybe that's the reason I liked it better. It was written with more attention to details and I even liked the history aspect. There I said it, I, Renee, liked the history aspect of this story! Don't let that get out, I have a reputation to uphold. This did have some mild steam and I really enjoyed it. Katelyn's Chronicles was a sweet love story, who doesn't like that.

The Hero is not a jerk, he is a well mannered man who knows what he wants. The heroine falls in love with the Hero, and it is a perfect romance. There is just one little issue...Spoiler alert:After Katelyn's parents were brutally murdered, she went to live with her aunt and uncle and transfered to a new college. She had a great roommate and was getting her life put back together when she and her roommate met a very attractive and well mannered man on the campus. He was actually a benefactor of the college. Katelyn was drawn to him immediately. Eventually James, the attractive man, invited Katelyn and her roommate to visit his antebellum home Whitehall.It was the first of several invitations. Katelyn's attraction grew with each encounter. James seemed to care for her as well. When the relationship began to get serious, she had a talk with James. He confirmed what she subconsciously suspected, he was a vampire. An extremely well mannered vampire, still, a vampire.The respect and depth of care and consideration that James showed to Katelyn is worthy of the best love story. This is not another \"pity me I'm a vampire\" story, but a very sweet love story in which the man just happens to be a vampire. Katelyn now has a decision to make. In order to spend the rest of her life with James, Katelyn will have to make some changes. She will have to become a vampire also.Katelyn also gets to meet James' family. The interaction between the characters can only be described as sweet and caring.

Something good would happen, and I'd be interested, then it got boring. Katelyn was very immature, and I don't understand why James would want her. Because she's beautiful? Makes him pretty shallow.

This is in every way a true love story. Boy and girl meet and sparks fly, only in this case the man is keeping secrets. Secrets that could ultimately mean the end of the relationship. Can love overcome all?Twenty-one year old Katelyn Corbin's life was changed forever by an act of violence that left her parents dead. Two drug crazed men intent on robbing her parent's store panicked and killed them both leaving their bloody bodies where Katelyn discovered them. She now finds herself having to move from Atlanta to Charleston SC to live with her aunt and uncle, leaving behind the college she was attending and her friends.In addition to the horrible nightmares that Katelyn has every night, reliving her parent's death, she now has to start her senior year in college at a new school where she knows no one. Fortunately for Katelyn she meets her new roommate, Alexis Gordon and they become instant friends. But, her life is about to take another unexpected turn when she meets James Thomas Dubois. James is a large contributor to the college and lives in a huge old mansion known as Whitehall, the chemistry between Katelyn and him is instant. Little by little Katelyn falls in love with James and the feeling appears to be mutual, only there are things about him that have Katelyn seeking answers. Why is James so different? How does he always seem to know what she is thinking? Why does she seem to be able to hear him in her mind? If she asks her questions will the answers change her feelings for James?Is Katelyn's love for James enough for her to give up all she knows and all she is to be with him? James confesses all to Katelyn and leaves it her decision as to what she wants to do. He is so much in love with her that he refuses to take her choice away from her. Katelyn has experienced a lot of tragedy in her young life with her parent's death so can she truly make the right decision when it comes to James? Has she finally met the man, no matter what he is, who can bring her peace and security?We watch as Katelyn and James' love grows over a period of time and we learn all there is to know about James' past. As I stated earlier there is no violence, no evil supernatural beings causing havoc, just two people in love and I couldn't wait to read the end to learn the outcome. Although quite different than any other paranormal romance I have read, and I have read many, I enjoyed everything about this story. The only negative I had which kept me from giving this book 5 stars is that it went on for too long. New characters were added that really had no relationship to the earlier story.

I've only read two or three of each of the series that the blurb says this book will appeal to, but this book caught me off guard. Instead of being the fast paced action story that I had expected, this was a slow and beautiful tale of the gift of love. Out of every vampire story I've ever read, I've never read a story that considered turning another into a vampire a gift. Although at first I found this extremely odd, it grew on me. It was just a different aspect on vampirism that I hadn't come in contact with yet.\"James, Everything is so beautiful, I never knew the night held such secrets.\"As I said before, this was a slower paced story, the conflict was small and quickly resolved. Although normally this would be a negative for me, I found the book overall to be extremely peaceful. I read mostly at night and after a stressfull day, it was nice to unwind to a calm and well written story. The imagery was so well done in this story that I had no problem at all imagining even the smallest details of what was going on in the story. In fact (since I read at night), I had quite a few vivid vamp dreams because of this book. That's not happened to me in a few months. =PWhy not a five star? Now, I give this author credit for doing a good job with this story, I have to admit there were a couple things that did stand out to me. Being a male writer, I feel that there was some weirdness with the female characters. Overall, he did a great job making a well rounded female character, but there were just a few things that kind of annoyed me. At 21-22, I couldn't imagine giggling nearly as much as these girls did. I also don't think I've gotten excited about pajamas since I was 13. There was just a few things that made the characters seem very immature, and in the end, I just reaged them in my head to be teenagers. It just seemed to fit better. In the end, I suppose that everyone matures at a different rate. It was just difficult for me to personally imagine someone in their 20s being so immature.What would I like to see next? I think I'd like to see the family come across a larger conflict. Although I did enjoy the slow pace of this book, I think if there's a second book, there should be some more action. The slow pace of this book did very well to fully create and develop the characters, so now it's time for those characters to do something cool! They have all these great powers, I'd love to see them in action."}, {"userName": "Tonileg", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4879264-tonileg", "userReview": "*This felt like a long bit of FanFic which I don't like to read because I prefer original stories with new ideas.Bad things happen to good people.From the first chapter, Katelyn is a good person and bad bad things happen to her starting with the violent death of both her parents in a grocery store hold-up gone terribly wrong. She is lucky to have an Aunt 'Chele, who is the twin of her mother to help her sell her parent's estate off and start a new life in Carolina in her Aunt's family (just an Uncle and no cousins). Katelyn seems naively innocent for a 21 year old.She is starting her senior year in a new college and immediately makes friends with her roommate, who seems really nice because I have some crazy bad stories from my friends from our college years...Katelyn meets Mr. Dubois at the college cafe on her first day on campus and he notices her as she does the same. She makes a plan to paint the entry pathway to his mansion, but that doesn't last long because she is bitten by a huge snake and almost dies. Jeremy Dubois give her 'antivenin' and she quickly heals from the mortal bite, but with strange side effects but as she has never had to take antivenin she believes Jeremy when he explains her questions away. She builds up questions and then they make love (not very sexy scene, but it was supposed to be). She finds out what Jeremy is and then chooses to become like him and he puts a plan together to get rid of her friend and family in a couple days so they won't see Katelyn for a few years and notice the 'changes' that will occur.I started getting really bored at this point, it is the middle point of the story and I pushed on with the story, but I just couldn't believe in the chemistry between the H/h there were only two 'dates' before they jumped into an immortal forever relationship. Didn't convince me. I also thought that the making of Katelyn into a immortal was boring and using of lots of 'Twilight' rules for Vampires. The sharing of blood with the older immortals was different, but once again I couldn't stay with the story because there didn't seem to have any mystery or challenge or plot to push the reader's interest. I had to quit at 75% because I didn't care for the characters and this is the only story in the past 12 months that I could not finish.Kindle freebie and a full length novel with was too long for this boring Vamp story.1 star"}, {"userName": "Caragh", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4320856-caragh", "userReview": "This review can also be found at: http://loadedshelves.blogspot.co.uk/2...Rick H. Veal's debut novel The Master of Whitehall follows the story of a young troubled girl, Katelyn, who after experiencing a traumatic event, moves away to a new school where she meets the elusive owner of Whitehall and begins a new adventure.I was immediately impressed that a male author was writing through the eyes of a female character. Although it is not a rare thing, i'm always interested in how well it works out. In the case of Veal, he does it very well at the beginning but unfortunately he doesn't quite keep up the pace as the story progresses. I was also gripped by the suspense from the beginning of the novel and felt protective of Katelyn on the first page which was unusual for me. James Dubois, who is as the title suggests, the Master of Whitehall 'speaks' beautifully and more than once I was drawn in by his use of language in comparison to the every day vernacular of the other characters. There were even times when I was reminded of Mr Darcy...! Particularly when Katelyn experiences Whitehall for the first time, just as Elizabeth did with Pemberley. What made The Master of Whitehall stand out for me, was the attention to detail during the 'changing' between human and Vampire. I really enjoyed the in-depth explanation of what both parties were feeling during the entire process, and the care afterwards. I didn't enjoy it so much the second time as I knew what was going to happen but overall it was well written.I also enjoyed the use of history in the novel. It was interesting to read and added an extra layer of development for the characters which helped the connection between the novel and myself. Just as a quick side note: the character Lexi lifted the novel for me. She was endearing and reminded me a lot of my own best friend. I would be interested in reading more about her and her life...The Master of Whitehall was a good read and a different type of vampire novel which was great as there are so many out there! I would like to warn readers of some 'explicit' love scenes though! Recommended for fans of love stories and vampires :)"}, {"userName": "Fab Fun & Tantalizing Reads", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16876836-fab-fun-tantalizing-reads", "userReview": "The Master of WhitehallRick H. VealReviewed by S. Bree High YATR I want to say first off, kudos to you Mr. Veal\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. Not only did he give us one great female character (Katelyn) he wrote two. We had a fabulous secondary character (Lexi) who I adored in this story. I felt he did a great job here. I liked Lexi and felt that her character was a great addition to the story.Vampires and romance this book has both. Our leading lady Katelyn has tragedy. Not just any but brutal, awful tragedy in her life! She has to move from her town to Charleston. She sets out to make a new life, and get over the past. She goes to a new school and she meets James. James Dubois is the owner of Whitehall. James is mesmerizing, and I found myself captivated by him. He speaks at times in the book as if he is from another time, and I got caught up in his words. I think that James had a lonely life and I felt a bit sad for him at times. Although I liked the story with James and Katelyn, I wanted to know what was going to happen. Where were they going to take me? Will the secrets kept be the thing that ends them? Will love be enough?  This was not your typical Vampire and human love story for me. The book is rich in history and well written. It also had a bit of \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdsteam\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. It was tastefully done. The book gave us a different story than all the other vampire books out there. I enjoyed it and it was a good read, wonderful love story. My only negative on the story, is I think it could have been shorter. There were a few parts that could have been removed, and the story would have still held merit. Although that does not change the core story for me, and I still enjoyed it overall. I am looking forward to where the story will go, there seemed to be opening for second book and I would be interested in reading the next part of the story. Overall if you want a good love story, with a bit of steam this is the book for you."}, {"userName": "Amber Garr", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3168081-amber-garr", "userReview": "3.5 stars.This was a different kind of vampire novel for me. Katelyn is trying to get back to a normal college life after her parents are brutally murdered. She immediately finds a great friendship with her new roommate and attracts the eye of a mysterious patron of the school. Although at first I was a little annoyed with the \u201cinsta-love\u201d between Katelyn and James, there is more time spent on their developing relationship in the second part of the book. The secondary characters were interesting and I would like to read more about them. James has had a long and somewhat lonely life, and I was glad that we got a few chapters from his perspective. I will admit that I thought the introduction of the lost teenage vamp might prove to create a mess in Katelyn\u2019s life, and was slightly disappointed when he didn\u2019t try to steal/kidnapped/kill her. The novel progressed nicely, although I wished for a little more action and drama as is typical for the vampire novels I\u2019ve read. However, Mr. Veal did an excellent job at creating a wonderful love story that showed the nicer side of falling in love with a vampire. He also left a good little cliffhanger that leaves the door open for a sequel.The Good: I felt like I really got to know the characters and I enjoyed seeing Katelyn embrace her new life and her responsibilities to others. The Issue: This story was 104,000 words that I think could have been told in 80,000. There were a lot of instances (primarily in the first half of the book) with loads of internal monologue, which would then be repeated in dialogue or could have been part of the descriptions in the character\u2019s POVs. While not a fatal error, I found it to slow down the story and distract me from the main point of the discussion.In short: A pleasant read for fans of vampires, romance, and feel-good stories."}, {"userName": "Sassy Bama Girl", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39846827-sassy-bama-girl", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I'm normally not a fan of paranormal books but I think Rick Veal might have changed my mind. Well, I at least like his paranormal books, maybe we shouldn't judge all books by the genre it is lumped in.This book is set in gorgeous South Carolina, and Veal romanticized every little detail of that beautiful city. I want to take a vacation now, no I want to move there now!His descriptions were almost like poetry, fabulous job. His characters are great, even his secondary characters are well fleshed out. Both Katelyn and Lexi are sweet, lovable girls that you could see yourself liking in real life. My heart really went out to Katelyn over her tragedy. She is so determined to start over and move on with her life. This made me see how strong she was, and I love strong females in books.James Dubois is a vampy, and he owns the huge house \"Whitehall.\" (Which again is described beautifully.) He totally mesmerizes Katelyn and pulls her in with his magnetism. He had me under his spell too, those vamps will do that to you.This is different than most vampire love stories I have read before, maybe that's the reason I liked it better. It was written with more attention to details and I even liked the history aspect. There I said it, I, Renee, liked the history aspect of this story! Don't let that get out, I have a reputation to uphold. This did have some mild steam and I really enjoyed it. Katelyn's Chronicles was a sweet love story, who doesn't like that. I give Katelyn's Chronicles 5 stars, it is very well written!"}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11747882-samantha", "userReview": "Let me start out by saying this book was awesome! I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect from reading the back cover and I was pleasantly surprised. In The Master of Whitehall we are introduced to college student Katelyn. Her life is disrupted when her parents die a terrible death, and she has to move in with her Aunt \u2019Chele and start a new school. She moves into student housing and meets her new roommate Lexi and she can tell right away that they will be bestfriends. As they embark on their new friendship, Katelyn is fascinated by a guy that often hangs out on campus and owns a beautiful property, James. There is just something about him, and Katelyn wants to know what it is.Katelyn is thrilled when James approaches her and asks if her and Lexi want to see Whitehall. Of course there is no way she is going to turn down that offer! From this moment, Katelyn\u2019s life will change dramatically.Will James be able to answer all of the questions that Katelyn has? Is he going to be there for her while she is going through everything in her life? Will Katelyn and Lexi be able to remain close? You will just have to read the book and find out!I loved this book. It gave a totally new spin of vampires and what we typically expect from them. Katelyn\u2019s character was written so well. I loved how Veal conveyed her strength and personality. Lexi\u2019s character was also fabulous. There were definitely times I felt that I could relate to her. There is also plenty of romance, and boy is it steamy! I definitely recommend The Master of Whitehall to anyone that loves YA or paranormal romance!*I won this book in a giveaway"}, {"userName": "Betty", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19236771-betty", "userReview": "This is not your usual vampire story but a very captivating and romantic love story. Katelyn Corbin is a beautiful and intuitive 21 year old woman who discovers her parents murdered in their store. Her Aunt comes and helps her with the selling of the house and store. Katelyn goes to live with her Aunt and Uncle in South Carolina who are childless. She is going to college there and there she meets her roommate, Lexi (Alexis Gordon). They become best of friends and more like sisters. Katelyn meets the handsome and debonair James Thomas Dubois, who owns the Whitehall Manor, which was rebuilt in 1720. Their attraction is instantaneous and unbeknownst to Katelyn, he is a vampire. However, subconsciously Katelyn knows there is something different about James. This is their tale of romance, adventures and sacrifice on Katelyn's part. The secondary characters are just as grand. There is Charlotte Ann, who sired James, was his lover and now remains his best friend. She also becomes a very close friend of Katelyn's. Of course there is Lexi, Katelyn's best friend; then the fledgling Dale, who was left adrift and untrained by his sire. Charlotte Ann takes him under her wing to educate him. My review doesn't do justice to this book so you will have to read it for yourself!What an adventure this story was and looking forward to reading Lexi's story next.

I'm in!!I love a good vampire story, especially one with a girl like Katelyn! And James, HELLO! The pace of this book was slow, but not in a bad way. There is rich history, lessons, warnings, love, conflict, etc. This book has it all. This story unwinds as it goes, draws you in and then makes you want more. There are so many things I want yet. I wasn't ready for this story to be over. All of the characters were unique, just like every day people. :-)I was put off by the insta-love between Katelyn and James. But that is me. I love how Katelyn grew and accept her new life. It's taken me awhile to write the review because I fell in love with this book and will reread this book. I've already suggested it to my vampire loving friends and will do so again and again. I've also recommended it to my romance/history friends because it can fall into that bucket too. This is a grown up vampire story, not a child's book. So why a 4 star and not a 5 since I loved this book. There were parts for me that were unnecessary, they didn't add to the book. There was also the immaturity of Katelyn and Lexi. They are in college, no high school girls. But other wise I did enjoy the book. I'm ready for book #2 - Lexi's turn??"}], "description": "After the brutal murder of her parents, Katelyn Corbin, a thoroughly modern twenty-one year old college senior, faces the prospect of restarting her life.
