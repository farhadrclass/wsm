It's funny, concise and full of interesting characters. However I found some things in it to just be kind of cheesy and unreal, the vocabulary was limited and it was just verbatim repeating the events of the film itself."}, {"userName": "Goodness", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6117211-goodness", "userReview": "Good"}], "description": "", "title": "Richie Rich", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21527489-richie-rich", "average": 3.74, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1395454357l/21527489.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/31468.Todd_Strasser", "name": "Todd Strasser"}], "type": ["Childrens", "Humor", "Fiction", "Humor", "Adventure"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21527489-richie-rich", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3313312-richie-rich", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/481743.The_Wave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/350507.Give_a_Boy_a_Gun", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/518593.Boot_Camp", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6249550-wish-you-were-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17262252-fallout"]}
