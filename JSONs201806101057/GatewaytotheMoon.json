We are then taken back in time to 1492 and we meet Luis de Torres. This \u201cis not his real name. It is Yosef Ben Ha Levi Halvri \u2014 Joseph, Son of Levi, the Hebrew. But he became Luis de Torres earlier that year when the Alhambra Decree called for expulsion or conversion of all the Muslims and Jews. \u201c As a Jew you convert or be executed or escape if you could. Luis decides to escape, setting sail with Columbus for the new world . Thus we are presented with the link between these two characters, across continents and centuries, as well as an explanation of some rituals of the Catholic people of Entrada de la Luna such as the lighting of the candles on Friday evening. Rituals that they can\u2019t explain, other than it is their custom. These alternate with other narratives in between - Rachel Rothstein, a sad troubled woman with a failing marriage who hires Miguel to babysit her two sons, Elena, Miguel\u2019s aunt who has left the town and with whom Miguel feels a connection through the post cards she sends from her journeys. We follow several other characters from the past as well. These stories were skillfully brought together by lovely prose and a captivating telling. I have read only one other book by Morris, The Jazz Palace and she easily carried me to these times and places as she did in that novel . In reading the acknowledgments, it\u2019s clear that the book is well researched and even a brief internet search will illustrate this. While this in so many way is about the Spanish Inquisition, it is about connecting characters across centuries, about beliefs, religious persecution, finding one\u2019s identity, the pains of hiding one\u2019s identity in order to survive, about one\u2019s heritage, about how much of the past is present through who one\u2019s ancestors are. This is a well written story with wonderful characters from both the past and present and I highly recommended it. (As an aside : Up until a week ago, I thought I knew all there was to know about my roots because I knew that all of my grandparents were born in Italy . I recently did an AncestryDNA test out of curiosity since my husband has been working on his genealogy and has found some interesting things about where his ancestors were from. I mention this here, because I found out I was a lot more than Italian and that made this a meaningful story for me in some ways . I am 43% Italian, 15% Mideast, 14% Caucasus, 11% Iberian Peninsula, 11% European Jewish and a smattering of other countries with lower %\u2019s. I find this so fascinating and moving and I felt connected to this story .)I received an advanced copy of this book from Nan Talese /Doubleday through Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Tucker", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39633342-tucker", "userReview": "Mary Morris has taken me on an unforgettable journey with her latest novel \u201cGateway to the Moon.\u201d The journey stretches from Spain during the times of Columbus and the horrors and consequences of the Inquisition to recent times in Northern New Mexico. Prior to this, I was sadly lacking in knowledge about the Inquisition, but Morris\u2019s extensive research brought that time period and the real and fictional characters vividly to life. As a lifelong resident of the Southwest, I had some awareness of the existence of crypto-Jews, and Morris greatly enhanced my knowledge and understanding of a situation which seems almost too unbelievable to be true, particularly if you\u2019ve witnessed the strong Catholic presence and influence in towns like Chimayo and Espanola. (For readers interested in learning more about crypto-Jews, Morris references \u201cTo The End of the Earth: Crypto-Jews of Northern New Mexico\u201d by Stanley Hordes.) I learned a lot of fascinating history from this book, but the greatest pleasures were Morris\u2019s brilliant writing and a well-told and absorbing story. I was particularly affected by the searches the characters undertook to find their place in their families and the world, and the recurrent theme of stars and celestial navigation. The last paragraph of the book is one of the most perfect endings I\u2019ve read in a long time and a wonderful form of benediction for new beginnings.Settle back in a comfy chair with some hot cocoa and embark on this remarkable journey.

Gateway to the Moon begins during the time of Christopher Columbus, the Spanish Inquisition, all the way through the present day, where there is a community of \u201cCrypto Jews\u201d living in New Mexico who are Catholic but continuing many Jewish traditions (and not knowing why).

Miguel Torres, a main character, sees some similarities between his community\u2019s culture in Entrada de la Luna and the Jewish artist for whom he works. Mary Morris\u2019 writing is stunning, and through the unique narrative style of traveling in time via historical \u201cvignettes,\u201d exploring the ancestors of Entrada\u2019s residents, a portrait is painted of a community with a new understanding of its fascinating roots.

A dark, but rich and fascinating family history-This novel spans continents and centuries in time to tell the story of Entrada de la Luna, a four-hundred -year old town located in New Mexico. The residents often perform rituals handed down through the generations, but do not understand their origins. The author adeptly connects the past with the present in an incredible family saga, as wrenching as it is fascinating and poignant- almost bittersweet. In 1492, Luis de Torres, who was forced to convert from Judaism to Catholicism during the Spanish Inquisition, leaves his family to set sail with Christopher Columbus. His travels are the beginning of a journey, we will follow along with, as he and his future offspring settles into this new land.The time line alternates between ancient history, and 1992, where we meet fourteen-year-old Miguel, a young man who has keen interest in astronomy, and could have a bright future, but feels trapped by a lack of opportunity and poverty. His aunt Elena is a former ballerina who got out of Entrada de la Luna, and has a very good reason to stay out, but she also has a deep-seated need to return to her family and this small community. I\u2019m ashamed to admit, I don\u2019t know much about the Spanish Inquisition. I hear it referenced from time to time without really stopping to reflect on it, and I studied it some in school, of course, but that was a long, long, long time ago. So, reading this book was quite a learning experience for me. I was unaware of the \u2018Conversos\u2019 or \u2018Crypto\u2019 Jews, or that they continued to practice the rituals, traditions, and customs of the Jewish faith, without understanding the signficance of them. It was just something they had always done, passed down through the generations. The author explains how and why this happened, in striking and vivid details, some of which are very uncomfortable to read, but necessary all the same. The family connections linked to the historical parts of this story is so fascinating, as Miguel\u2019s lineage is eventually traced to him and his small hometown, in present day, 1992. The various character studies will take the reader into a deeper dimension and contrasts well with chapters detailing the ancient history leading us through various good and bad times for the Jewish people.  Although Rachel\u2019s relationship with Miguel is significant, especially in light of what was revealed to him, the exploration into her marriage and personal foibles was mostly off topic and distracting. Other than that, this is very eye-opening, enlightening novel, with a few stunning revelations that leave the door open for Miguel to view his life from an entirely different perspective. The writing is beautiful and exceptional. This is a novel that will certainly have a lasting and haunting effect on me. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "An enthusiastic 4 stars.Mary Morris has put together such an interesting novel. Mostly it takes place in New Mexico, focusing on Miguel and his family. But it also goes back in time to 15th to 17th century Spain, Portugal and Mexico. Miguel and his family are the descendants of Jews who fled and survived the Inquisition. In their very small community, they still practice many of the rituals of Judaism \u2014 for example, they light candles on Friday and they don\u2019t eat pork \u2014 but they don\u2019t know about their Jewish ancestry. That\u2019s the fascinating historical context, and in her acknowledgements Morris explains that it is based on a fair amount of research.But Morris has also created interesting and original characters. There is a lot of love in Miguel\u2019s family, but there\u2019s a lot of hurt too, which leaves Miguel somewhat unmoored. Besides his family, he becomes attached to a family that has newly moved to New Mexico from New York, for who he babysits. Rachel \u2014 the mother \u2014 is also a bit lost but a good soul.Morris tells the story through disparate strands, shifting points of view between a few characters, and at times going back to characters several hundred years back. You won\u2019t like this if you like straightforward stories. But I loved the characters, the history and the meandering narrative that came together quite nicely at the end.On a personal note, I recently traveled to Spain on vacation. The trip included an area where part of the story takes place. I had never thought much about the Inquisition or Spanish history until a few weeks ago. Stumbling onto Gateway to the Moon felt like perfect synchronicity.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."}, {"userName": "Marialyce", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce", "userReview": "5 extremely impressive starsEver wonder what makes you...you?

Are there customs your family does, like lighting candles on Friday night or having an aversion to certain foods so much so that they are never served in any of you family's homes or ever have been? Why is it that at times you momentarily have fleeting feelings that you have been somewhere, met someone, heard something that you knew you had never experienced before? In the fifteenth century Jews and Muslims were pursued with an intense vigor by the barbaric Inquisition in Spain which eventually traveled to Portugal and even further. Jews and Muslims escaped their country of origin and in this powerful novel we are introduced to Luis de Torres, a Spanish Jew, who accompanies Christopher Columbus as his interpreter on his journey to find a route to the Indies. His journey is the first one related and across many generations we read of the journeys of others both the hardship, the pain, landing many of the descendants in far flung places. Jews having been forced to accept Catholicism in order to survive. They traveled to the new world, Mexico, South America, and then to New Mexico. They are Catholics in name only but they are Jews in their heart and soul.As the book continues, many centuries later, there are many people who live in the hills of New Mexico who carry on traditions that they really can't understand the why of.

We learn of how the people down through the centuries were pursued, murdered, tortured and yet so many resisted what was being fostered upon them. They held their faith in secret masked among their supposed belief in the faith of Christ. This is a journey through life, a life that has come down through centuries. It was indeed a powerful story to tell, a telling of what is often hidden makes us what we often are.Thank you to Mary Morris for a book that engages both the heart and mind, to Doubleday Books and to Netgalley for making this book available to this reader."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28397995-nancy", "userReview": "In 1478 the Spanish Inquisition was established. The year that Columbus went on his first voyage of discovery, 1492, was also the year that all Jews and Muslims were expelled from Spain. Unless they converted to Christianity--or preferred to be burned at the stake.The Christian Jews outwardly lived like Christians, attending mass, but secretly clung to their way of life, lighting candles on Friday, avoiding pork, and circumcising their sons.So, the Conversos were targeted, massacred, imprisoned, tortured, and burned. The Jews fled to the New World, but the Inquisition followed to Mexico and the Jews moved into New Mexico.Gateway to the Moon by Mary Morris imagines the story of one Jewish/Converso family whose ancestor, Luis de Torres, came to the New World with Columbus, following the Torres family through the 15th and 16th centuries and into the 20th century. Living in Entada de la Luna, the Torres are good Catholics who traditionally light candles on Friday night, disdain to eat pork, and circumcise their sons. The cemetery holds generations of their ancestors. The townsfolk know that their ancestors came from Spain but no longer remember what brought them there.The story is told in two timelines, telling the contemporary story of Miguel Torres, a teenager with a passion for astronomy, and that of his ancestors beginning with Luis de Torres, a secret Jew born Leni Halvri before the Alhambra Decree. The horrific history of the Inquisition is revealed through the lives of the Torres family, providing drama and intrigue to the slower, more introspective story of Miguel. Miguel's world has also has its violence and sorrow.Morris's beautiful writing is a pleasure to read. Miguel is a wonderful, memorable character.

Teenager Miguel Torres, an amateur astronomer, takes a job providing childcare to Rachel Rothstein's two sons after school. He notices the similarities between her Jewish traditions and those of the Christian families of Entrada. Chapters set in 1992 are interwoven with historical chapters going back five centuries to the Inquisition in Spain. Jewish Luis de Torres had converted to Christianity to save his life, but the Inquisition is now rounding up the conversos. Fluent in many languages, Luis takes a job as an interpreter on one of Christopher Columbus' ships sailing west in search of gold in 1492. One wonders how people can be so unfeeling when reading about the brutal tortures of the Inquisition and the explorers' treatment of the native Americans. The book later follows members of the family to Lisbon and Mexico where they are also persecuted. Taking few belongings, these immigrants are on the move in the New World, hiding their Jewish heritage and looking for a place where they will be safe. After five centuries the only remnants of their prior life are in the Hebrew inscriptions etched on the tombstones in the Old Cemetery of Entrada. The dark cemetery is Miguel's favorite location to view the stars through his telescope.The characters and story lines in both the modern and historical chapters were fascinating. Author Mary Morris has written travel memoirs, and this novel also shows a journey. It's a journey of the crypto-Jews from Europe to the New World looking for a safe place to raise their families. Miguel is also on a journey as he reaches back to understand his past and stretches to the stars where his future lies.

Apparently Mary Morris has been around for a while and accumulated quite a body of work and only now have I come across her with this terrific story as a most auspicious of introductions. I love all things historical, fiction and nonfiction, and though I have read much about Columbus' voyages, I've never learned about crypto Jews until now. I knew about the Spanish inquisition and expulsion of Jews and, of course, it's certainly within the reasonable possibility that a tribe so wildly prosecuted throughout so many eras and places has found themselves migrating wildly across the globe, not much is written or known about the fate of the ones that came to the New World during the early years of its discovery, some even along with the Columbus' expeditions. And having come here, still persecuted and isolated from all they knew before, eventually assimilating into forgetting their very ancestry and believes, though, interestingly enough, not the customs. Thus Entrada de la Luna (Gateway to the Moon) came to be, an impoverish small town in New Mexico with 4 centuries of lineage traceable, but the source obscured by time. This is where a novel takes place in the recent past narrative of 1992, the rest is set back in the past starting with 1492 and on. Both accounts are stunningly compelling in their own right. The book starts with a timeline and dramatis personae, because awesomely enough many of the story's main players existed in real life. The book's main accomplishment, though, is making both factual and fictional characters seem so very real. The writing here is absolutely exceptional, not overwritten at all, despite being very descriptive and emotionally intelligent, there's vividness and clarity to the narration and the characters are immensely charismatic and completely engaging. A real book lover's book, a pleasure to read, a perfectly transporting sort of experience. Not only to learn something new, but also to be entertained, amazed and delighted. Much like Miguel, the book's protagonist, a young stargazer, you might experience something like awe at the world's randomness and interconnectedness and a grand mystery of it all. Loved this book.

But the residents have lost touch with their past and don\u2019t remember why they maintain certain rituals, such as shunning pork and lighting candles on Friday.Gateway to the Moon (Doubleday Books, digital galley) primarily follows Miguel, a poor high school student who discovers some unexpected similarities between his own life and that of the transplanted Jewish family for whom he babysits. The novel alternates between Miguel and his forebearers, who made their way to Entrada along with Spanish explorers.This unique novel works hard to wed the contemporary with the historical and for the most part succeeds.

I honestly thought this book was terrific. 4.5 but not rounding up mostly because I wanted more closure/more of the earlier story. To commend it: a well-written interesting story of history and historical fiction.Setting: \"In 1492, the Jewish and Muslim populations of Spain were expelled, and Columbus set sail for America. Luis de Torres, a Spanish Jew, accompanies Columbus as his interpreter. His journey is only the beginning of a long migration, across many generations. Over the centuries, de Torres\u2019 descendants travel from Spain and Portugal to Mexico, finally settling in the hills of New Mexico. Five hundred years later, it is in these same hills that Miguel Torres, a young [teenage] amateur astronomer, finds himself trying to understand the mystery that surrounds him and the town he grew up in. \"The moon has an integral part of the narrative. It is used in navigation [early story]. Miguel is fascinated with it. And it even plays a role in menstrual cycles and impregnation. They all are tied together in this entrancing narrative. And the setting in New Mexico is a small town called Entrada de la Luna--Gateway to the Moon.Columbus and his translator [Luis de Torres] are the genesis of the story. Some of the crossovers/mysteries [noted later in the novel]: why were some of the traditions observed in New Mexico so simlar to those of the Jews of the 15th century? For example, not eating pork, and lighting candles on Friday nites. Certain dishes that resonated across centuries and continents [i.e., Elena's visit to Morocco]. The earlier story was both heartbreaking and enchanting. Each time another piece was revealed I was more fascinated. The families that had to hide their Jewishness under the pretense of being conversos/New Christians. Many of the characters in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were real people [there is a list in the front of principal characters and they are duly noted as historical figures]. Some of the more interesting storylines: the love stories, the Inquisition, the history of cacao, the desire to die as a Jew (before the priests can give a Christian burial). The story of the crypto-Jews--in Spain and Portugal--and how they came to be in New Mexico was extremely engaging. I knew about the latter, but not the former. The novel is populated with many characters past and present. But I liked the older story better. There were so many characters I loved--but they were primarily from the older story: including Inez Cordero, Beatrice, Francisco, Alejandro, Sofia, and Federico.The later story (1992), also quite interesting in terms of the various characters [New Mexico]. Introduced here to Miguel, Roberto, MG, Vincent Roybal, the Rothsteins, Elena.

Told between two different timelines, Gateway to the Moon, was not just an intriguing fiction but it was interwoven with unknown history that had me reading at a slower pace but it picked up steam as Morris worked magic interweaving the two timelines to create a unique story.This has been the first time I read a book by Morris so unknowingly I knew i was going to be reading a piece of fiction from the blurb but this was so much more. I truly loved the work involved by Morris to include aspects of history that are rarely broached in the US school system and it was a great learning experience. Hopefully I manage to read more of Morris's' work in the future."}, {"userName": "Cat", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3390466-cat", "userReview": "This was a fascinating novel about the persecution of Jewish people in the time of Christopher Columbus and how there came to be \"unknown\" Jewish descendants in New Mexico.

I couldn't stop reading it, despite the fact that the subject matter, Jews who were forced to pretend to be Christians in 1492, wasn't something I'd normally decide to read about. Nonetheless, I'm glad I did. Learned a lot and Morris made me feel great empathy for their plight. Really enjoyed how she showed the modern-day effects on their progeny, who, in the US, didn't even know they'd been Jews. Fascinating slice of history and characters who lived as full human beings, alive in my mind, and about whom I cared.

Award-winning author Mary Morris alternates between past and present, fascinating us with the lives she gives historical characters, and intriguing us with their modern-day descendants. Where did we come from, and who are we as a people? Why do we not eat pork, and why do we light candles on Friday night? Seemingly simple questions, with momentous answers.

Three of them are highlighted in Mary Morris\u2019 expansive family saga, Gateway to the Moon. First, there is our family history, portrayed here by the harrowing tale of the Cordero de Torres family from 1492 to the 1600s. Next, there is what happens to someone during their life, seen in the struggles of Elena Torres to make peace with the night a group of teenage boys attacked and raped her. Lastly, there is one\u2019s own internal fire, which can propel a person like Miguel Torres out of his poor circumstances, past his mistakes, to a distinguished career as an astrobiologist. This novel moves slowly, but offers plenty of food for thought...Read the rest of my review at A Bookish Type.

A historical fiction beginning during the Spanish Inquisition, weaving between history and modern times. The journey begins on Christopher Columbus\u2019 journey to the New World where a Jewish translator accompanies him and the book ultimately ends in the New Mexican town of Entrada de la Luna, where the residents have practiced some interesting traditions over hundreds of years but have no idea why. The book details the plight and migration of Jews during the inquisition in Spain, Mexico and the new colonies, including those who became conversos, those who converted to Roman Catholicism although some secretly continued to practice or adhere to Jewish traditions. Although sometimes a little slow in parts, the characters were well defined and generally likeable.

Morris has written the story of the conversos or crypto-Jews, in a way that brings the story to the heart. Set initially in 1492 and in 1992, it tells the tale of the Torres family, through both the ancestors and Miguel, an incredibly smart kid in a tough place. I didn't know this bit of history and appreciate the incredible amount of research Morris did. She has written educational historical fiction with a huge heart. This is a family saga as well as the tale of a people. Thanks to Netgalley for the ARC. This is one I'm going to recommend to others."}, {"userName": "Kati Berman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12597457-kati-berman", "userReview": "I received Gateway to the Moon from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. The novel has two interconnecting story lines. One starts in 1492 with Columbus\u2019s first voyage to the New World and the eventual discovery of America. 1492 is also the year when the Jews of Spain were expelled or were required to convert to Catholicism. Many Jews converted, many were killed and many left. Those who converted secretly retained many of their Jewish customs, though outwardly they declared Christianity. In Spain they were called the Marranos, secret Jews. I have known about the Marranos in Spain and Portugal, but I was not aware of the crypto-Jews who left Europe, settled in the New World , lived as Christians, but maintained many Jewish customs over centuries and after a while not even knowing why they followed some rituals or that they had any connection to Judaism. The second story line picks up in 1992 in Entrada de Luna (Gateway to the Moon) New M\u00e9xico. Most of this story centers around Miguel Torres, a teenager and his family, who can trace their ancestors back 400 years at that location. Miguel spends much of his time in an ancient cemetery established by his ancestors, where he is fascinated by the stars, the moon and is very interested in astronomy. Miguel takes a babysitting job with a Jewish family who have recently moved from New York to New Mexico. He is much liked by Rachel, the Mom, but has hardly any connection with the Dad, Nathan. After a freak accident, for which Miguel blames himself he doesn\u2019t return to his job. There is much I liked about this book, especially the historical elements, and how the author traced the current inhabitants of New Mexico to the original secret Jews based on facts. However I felt distracted by some details that had no real connection to the story, for example, Rachel\u2019s marriage issues. First I didn\u2019t understand why a great kid, like Miguel had such a low self esteem, but towards the end of the book, this became clearer. I found some of the story lines a little convoluted, both in the past and present. Overall I would give this book 3.5 stars. Thanks NetGalley, Doubleday Books and the author, Mary Morris for the advanced copy."}, {"userName": "Artemis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50204686-artemis", "userReview": "Looking forward to reading your book, Mary!"}, {"userName": "Michelle Arredondo", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42905899-michelle-arredondo", "userReview": "Gateway To The Moon by Mary Morris, I found such a joy to read. Easy to get into....we travel between two different times. 1992, New Mexico, a small town....lots of canyons and rugged and beautiful scenery...atmospheric and interesting and illuminating. Families..and their interesting and complicated little lives. One particular boy, Miguel...intrigued by astronomy, driven to working odd jobs. Reading about the stars...constellations...planets...high above a totally different world...an arid and beautiful place..but a place of dead ends and stand stills..a life some people are anxious to flee from. I loved the complication of these lives...the dysfunctions...the Mexican culture...the everyday dilemmas and the not so everyday dilemmas. That's just the first story....We traveled between worlds. The second being 1492...Christopher Columbus..recruiting a team of people to board and man his ship...traveling to unknown worlds..or rather discovering unknown worlds. We delve into the view of Luis de Torres....a Jewish man among Christians. are united with the beauty of the skies...the stars, constellations, the mystery....and right below, a raw world of destruction, barbaric actions, disease, pestilence, fear, and sacrifice. The Spanish Inquisition...and what it meant for the Jews and the Christians. So many intriguing topics..so many historical references...and all so beautifully written. I had so much fun reading this book. The two worlds..so different...and yet so connected. Highly recommend. A big thank you to Mary Morris, Nan A.

Luis de Torres, a Spanish Jew, accompanies Columbus as his interpreter. His journey is only the beginning of a long migration, across many generations. Over the centuries, de Torres\u2019 descendants travel from Spain and Portugal to Mexico, finally settling in the hills of New Mexico. Five hundred years later, it is in these same hills that Miguel Torres, a young amateur astronomer, finds himself trying to understand the mystery that surrounds him and the town he grew up in. Entrada de la Luna is a place that holds a profound secret--one that its residents cannot even imagine. It is also a place that ambitious children, such as Miguel, try to leave. Poor health, broken marriages, and poverty are the norm. Luck is unusual. When Miguel sees a flyer for a babysitting job, he jumps at the opportunity, and begins work for a Jewish family new to the area. Rachel Rothstein is not the sort of parent Miguel expected. A frustrated artist, Rachel moved her family from New York in search of a fresh start, but so far New Mexico has not solved any of the problems she brought with her. Miguel loves the work, yet he is surprised to find many of the Rothstein family's customs similar to ones he\u2019s grown up with and never understood. Interwoven throughout the present-day narrative are the powerful stories of the ancestors of Entrada's residents, highlighting the torture, pursuit, and resistance of the Jewish people. A beautiful novel of shared history, Gateway to the Moon is a moving and memorable portrait of a family and its journey through the centuries.", "title": "Gateway to the Moon", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35837195-gateway-to-the-moon", "average": 4.27, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1501157821l/35837195.jpg", "reviews": 60, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/28781.Mary_Morris", "name": "Mary Morris"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "Adult Fiction", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35837195-gateway-to-the-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35791945-gateway-to-the-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/190555.Nothing_to_Declare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22716393-the-jazz-palace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/785440.The_River_Queen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1442697.Wall_to_Wall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/448660.Maiden_Voyages"]}
