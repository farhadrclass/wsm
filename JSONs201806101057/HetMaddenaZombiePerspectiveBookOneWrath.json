Zombies are mindless beings we cheer for the hero to slaughter...right? Not so in this exciting tale! Het is the perfect combination of hero and monster, who kept me turning pages to see what was next. I found myself pulling for the undead, and looking forward to another story from this talented, imaginative author!"}, {"userName": "Joy Killar", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5333349-joy-killar", "userReview": "LOVED THIS KICK ASS BOOK! More of a review to follow!"}, {"userName": "Brendan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/344179-brendan", "userReview": "Het Madden follows the adventures of a man who finds himself in the middle of a zombie outbreak, infected but sentient. He gathers together a few other sentient zombies and leads them on a crusade to find out where the zombie virus (called Wrath) came from and how to stop it. The story has some interesting ideas, but suffers from poor editing and copyediting. A few thoughts: * Miller constructs a series of ways to influence zombies \u2014 drugs, vaccines, anti-viral medications, viruses \u2014 that allows the novel to have a melodramatic valence. The rules for who can control the undead and who will be controlled by them are constantly changing, and so the story stays surprising. Similarly, several of the characters have multiple levels of motivation and intention, so we\u2019re never sure which side they\u2019re playing on, if any. * My favorite aspect of the novel was what Het comes to call the Frenzy, a kind of group-think that zombies get into when they\u2019re in huge mobs. They become ravenous and animalistic beyond all control, ripping apart whatever they can. As a neat twist, when zombies are in Frenzy they will often murder one another if there are no living people to attack. This angle of the story is unique, as far as I can tell, and adds solid tension to Madden\u2019s journey \u2014 he\u2019s always having to think about how to keep his horde of ravenous zombies from slipping into Frenzy and killing one another. * At the same time, I had a lot of trouble with the sentence-level writing in the book. Miller uses ellipses and exclamation points more than he needs to, and there are quite a few typos and other errors. (For example, CDC is called the Center for Disease Control instead of the Centers.) While these factors are ultimately insignificant to the story, they highlighted for me the value of a good copyeditor and a good editor. By contrast, I notice the five reviews on Amazon are pretty positive, with almost no one commenting on these issues. * It\u2019s interesting that the zeitgeist seems, right now, to side with the zombies. While David Wellington\u2019s Monster cycle started this trend, Miller\u2019s book joins Robin Becker\u2019s Brains and at least one other book, Breaking News, that I\u2019m planning to read in this year\u2019s zombie season. In each case, the author expects us to side with the zombies and provides very little sense of shame or sadness on the part of the zombies who are murdering people. In fact, Het Madden and Becker\u2019s book are so similar that, when just thinking about plot points, I need to be careful not to confuse them. To be clear, both were published within the last two years, so they\u2019re certainly just drawing on the cultural moment. I\u2019m not suggesting anything improper.Het Madden is built on a strong foundational idea, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have gone through the necessary revisions to really let that story shine."}, {"userName": "Wendy Potocki", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2389422-wendy-potocki", "userReview": "I have to start off this review by saying that I'm not really into zombies. I may have watched ten minutes of a zombie movie somewhere in my life, but that's about it. I've never even seen Night of the Living Dead all the way through. Needless to say, this is the first novel I've read about these mindless flesheaters. Since I ventured out into virgin territory in doing so, I'm not sure what is expected by fans of this genre. I'll just tell you what this novice thought and hope it's enough.As mentioned above, I'm not an aficionado of this genre. Therefore, the thought of reading about zombies didn't attract me to the book. What did interest me was the take on this story, in that, it's written from the perspective of someone that's been transformed into one. Normally, we never get to hear what goes on in their decaying heads. I thought the viewpoint worked and I liked hearing about the experience from a first person, er, I mean, first zombie perspective.As for the writing, I tend to like a lot more character development and descriptive adjectives littering what I read, but Mr. Miller's straightforward style worked. The writing held my interest and was more than adequate to convey the story and describe what was going on.Het Madden did deliver. I was more than pleasantly surprised that a whopper of a doomsday/apocalyptic/conspiracy theory is woven into the heart of the novel. I am a huge conspiracy theorist and love these sorts of overblown, bigger-than-life theories splattered across my blood-soaked pages. This ultimate war between opposing sides is just the sort of thing that gets my teeth gnashing, and this one was no exception. I felt what was lacking in some aspects of storytelling was more than made up for in a cleverly plotted tale that manages to knit together several well-known, end of the world theories. I could add a few of my own, and have, but will let this one alone.I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading more from Mr. Miller. I would also be interested to read where the story is taken as the basic premise leaves a lot of room for it to grow. There are grisly thrills and plenty of stomach churning horrors for those of you who just can't get enough gore. You can almost hear the chomping in the background as you read along.As for me, I don't think I'll ever look at a ham sandwich the same way."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17016127-leah", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this book!It had a lot of things going on at one time and still managed to pull everything together to make a believable and entertaining story. At first I was put off by the seemingly juvenile / simplistic sentence structure and vocabulary, but it changed after a bit and I read onward. It did revert back to the simpler sentences later in the book again but not long enough for me to stop reading. I actually believe 2 people had a hand in writing this book, however, that is only my opinion. It did not stop me from thoroughly enjoying it from cover to cover.I've read quite a few zombie perspective stories, and enjoyed them all. This was by far my favorite though. It had many elements that many others didn't think to include - the 2012 end of the world, super viruses, good & bad zombies... I was very impressed by the originality and how much it entertained me. Very rarely do I finish a book and immediately want to read it again. I even looked online to see if there was a Wrath Book 2 yet. If Calvin A.L. Miller II had all these elements floating around in his head together - no wonder he had to write a book! I hope to see more from him.Bottom line, give this book a chance. You won't regret it. There was plenty of gore, suspense, laughs and story line to keep the pages turning and your mind wondering where the hell the story is headed."}, {"userName": "Felicia A", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1739957-felicia-a", "userReview": "A zombie book, from a zombie's perspective. Huh. Who'd a thunk? Well, it works, actually. I have to admit, I was not excited about the prospect of reading a book about zombies, and having to be concerned about what the ZOMBIES think. It does work, though. Even though Het is a stone cold (literally, LOL) killer zombie, he's actually a victim here. And yes, he gets cuthroat because he is a zombie, but still has his mental faculties, so identifies himself in this new form as a zombie/human hater, but still has some minor feelings for humans. When he's not trying to either eat them or turn them, that is. Interesting twists to the story that I won't spoil, but a good one to check out if you are looking for something different from the norm."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1527628-jennifer", "userReview": "The plot was intriguing.

No more."}], "description": "Written entirely from the perspective of a zombie named Hetfield Madden, the story follows Het from normal life, through infection, and then to his subsequent transformation into a monster. When he realizes that he's become something less than what he was, he struggles to come to grips with his new reality. The biggest challenge confronting this transition? Accepting the fact that he is now a zombie. Rather than merely the mindless, gruesome ghouls so often depicted in movies, Het and his fellow zombies view themselves as infected outcasts burdened by a sickness from which they can't seem to heal. Compounding their troubles is the fact that the government and society at-large (\"Healthies\") have completely rejected them, preferring to herd them into internment camps than help them recover their humanity. In light of everything confronting him, Het is forced to undergo a lot of spiritual reflection if he ever hopes to regain everything he's ever cared about. The age-old doomsday scenario of a post-apocalyptic world is twisted and told from the perspective of the diseased masses. it is written to inspire empathy in readers and invite them to consider just how it would feel to be afflicted by such a horrendous twist of fate and come face-to-face with society's prejudices and hypocritical leanings that effect even the slightest of our everyday decisions. There are also spiritual, religious, and political undertones woven throughout.
