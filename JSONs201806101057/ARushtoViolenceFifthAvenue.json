I'm delighted to have found this author a few months back thanks to a free offering on Amazon, and I've been hooked ever since. He does not disappoint. Each novel just gets better and better and \"A Rush to Violence\" is his best to date. In my opinion, it is just as good as any book you would go to the bookstore and pay 30 bucks for. Mr. Smith is not your run-of-the-mill \"indie\" author. You will not find the usual blatant self-publishing errors that scream at you from the page. I have found that while there is usually promise in a story or plot, many (dare I say most) of the time it is just not executed well; the books are wrought with grammatical and spelling errors, typos (really? typos? in the world of spellcheck?) the plot does not flow, and the formatting is horrible. NOT the case with Mr. Smith's works. They are professional, polished, and a pleasure to read.The publishing world is changing, I think in an exciting way for authors and readers alike, and I feel it is important to support these talented, promising authors who are trying to get off the ground. A few years ago I probably wouldn't have found this author until a major publishing house picked him up (and trust me they will), if at all. I want Mr. Smith to be able to keep those stories coming!! Do yourself a favor and stop digging through the coal for that diamond, I'm handing you one right now in \"A Rush to Violence\". You won't be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/737266-joyce", "userReview": "A most interesting plot. A multimillionaire dies, supposedly in an accident, and his one daughter, a former assassin, and her daughter are left his entire estate. Her siblings are left a disowning letter read with the will and are made tertiary beneficiaries after her and her daughter's deaths. A PI is hired by a mysterious man to locate this woman, and his extended family are threatened with death unless he locates her within two days. Then his family (with the exception of his current wife who is with him) are taken prisoner to ensure his capitulation to the man's demands. At this point everyone suspects the family of having murdered the original victim and his granddaughter (age 16) sets out on a quest to avenge his death unbeknownst to her mother. Meanwhile the PI's daughter (age 15) takes charge of the prisoners (four adults and her younger sister) and begins her quest for their freedom. The plot has some more twists and turns in it and will keep you reading. This was a good escapist novel."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/371844-sarah", "userReview": "I downloaded this a while back when it was free for kindle but for some reason put off reading it - perhaps having never heard of the author and the fact that I found it slight oddly written at first were to blame. However before I reached the end of the first chapter I was hooked - who was it in the millionaires hallway. Was his ex-hitwomen daughter all she seemed to be - completely reformed and doting on her daughter and Dad, were his kids really that full of greed they would kill and just who was Carr were just a few questions running around my head just a few chapters in.

I kid you not. Mass murdering teenage girls. A family and friends who knows every possible counter-kidnapping technique. Who ends up kisnapped. Yeah.....A billionaire who only likes one of his six children. Everything in this book is so improbable that it ends up working. Once you leave logic at the door this is a highly entertaining read. I know right? I was shocked to find myself keeping on turning the pages. Going go girl every now and again. I do however repeat. Teenage girls might be a murderous group and I am glad I don't have a girl.

It kind of read like an action movie or tv thriller, with genre tropes: one scene with over-the-top explosions in particular. But I enjoyed the way the story managed to maintain a kind of crazy energy, sort of the kind of thing that made me watch \"24\" compulsively. Even if, in the end, the book was a straightforward thriller, it seemed to be always teetering on the brink of insanity, or about to play havoc with my willing suspension of disbelief. And like a good schlocky thriller, it ends with a cliffhanger."}, {"userName": "ABCme", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8836208-abcme", "userReview": "Sixteen years after having left the life Camille teams up with Sam again and oh boy, are we in for a treat! With its fast pace and gripping storyline A Rush to Violence is my personal favorite in the 5th Avenue series so far. There's Marty and Jennifer protecting their extended family and Camille and Sam getting theirs together. The stories entwine in unexpected ways and all works out in the end, cliffhanger included.

Smith is a cultural genius.\" From in the #1 International Best-selling author of \"Fifth Avenue,\" \"Running of the Bulls,\" \"The Bullied Series,\" \"From Manhattan with Love\" and \"From Manhattan with Revenge,\" comes Smith's best thriller yet! 91,000 words or about printed 300 pages! Description: Sixteen years ago, Camille Miller left behind her life as an assassin in order to raise her daughter, Emma. But now, when her billionaire father is found brutally murdered, she must tap into old instincts to learn who killed her father and why. The suspects? Her six siblings, each so desperate for their father's money that they'd kill for it. What Camille doesn't see coming is Emma's plan to solve the mystery first. Or P.I. Marty Spellman's assignment, which is to find Camille or risk the deaths of those dearest to him. Over the course of one day, all three players, plus Spellman's teenaged daughter Beth, find themselves in a race to the finish. Nobody's goals are what they appear to be. Twists abound. And not one single person, for one single moment, is safe. PRAISE FOR CHRISTOPHER SMITH: ***JIM ASHLEY ON FIFTH AVENUE AND RUNNING OF THE BULLS*** Smith is this generation's Master storyteller. If you're a fan of suspense thrillers and unbelievable twists and turns, you will quickly become a fan of Christopher Smith! He entices you to fall in love with his characters only to be caught totally off guard when their fate goes in a direction you never saw coming. He takes the styles of James Patterson and Steven King to a totally kicking level. I can honestly say that I spent way too many late night hours reading chapters because I could not put it down and couldn't wait to see what he would do next. Starting with Fifth Avenue, he builds such entertaining and deep characters that you know this cannot be the end but just the start to future stories interweaving these strong individuals. With Running of the Bulls, you're so caught in the action - that you're honestly rooting for the characters that would historically be the bad guys in other tales. Christopher seems to set the bar higher and higher for himself, and I can't wait for his upcoming releases in 2012. A definite must read for mystery, suspense, and thriller lovers! ***PLANET KINDLE ON CHRISTOPHER SMITH*** \"Fifth Avenue, the first novel by penned Christopher Smith, is a fantastic first effort and was the reason I was simply unable to put my Kindle down over this Christmas period. And I would go as far to say that it ranks as one of the best first novels I\u2019ve ever read.\"--PLANET KINDLE ***P.M. RICHTER ON CHRISTOPHER SMITH*** \"Fifth Avenue. A big, big novel. A blockbuster? Yes. A bestseller. It should be. The author, at the beginning of the novel, thanks the people who introduced him to the 'real' Fifth Avenue. I suspect the real one could not be as interesting or engrossing as this novel. ...This is a highly recommended novel. It deserves the five stars.\" -- P.M. RICHTER ***JENNIFER LONG ON RUNNING OF THE BULLS*** \"Christopher Smith did it again. This book is packed with suspense, and delivers both characters that you will love and loathe. A time or two near the end, I found myself actually on the side of the villains and I really hope those two show up in Park Avenue. The story moves quickly...as most of the action all happens in one day.
