Can I say that I've never enjoyed a modern-set book more? And add to that a perfectly clean, heartwarming, beautiful romance? I'm done. I'm just done. Lori wick is my favorite, end of story. Her style is wonderful, and she effectively incorporates the 1940s feel into the book, almost effortlessly. The plot line wasn't action-packed or fast, but she kept my interest well. At times (which I really do appreciate) I was wondering what would happen next and why certain things were happening and how it would all work out. In a book like this, you wouldn't usually expect that. Let me just say, I really learned something from Lorri's (the main character in the book) sister. If you read it, you'll probably see what I mean. But that's not all. The entire book is filled with messages. I'm sure these are all things that Mrs. Wick has gathered over the years through her study of the Bible and faith in God. I appreciated it so much. This is one of the few books that I can say truly hold up to the title of 'Christian' fiction. I'm glad I read it. This was the first book I've read from her, but it certainly won't be the last. Utterly charming!"}, {"userName": "Haley S", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30268420-haley-s", "userReview": "Time to talk about one of my favorite books of all times! A long time ago, I said that I really needed to do a review on this book. Well, I finally am doing it!This was my second Lori Wick book. I fell in love with it immediately. I remember my first time reading it. I did not want to get up. Nope, I think I was reading for hours upon hours. I think I have read this book a total of\u2026probably between ten or twenty times\u2026over a couple years, of course!The first half of the story, to be honest, is very sad. Then, it gets less-so during the second part. But, overall, the entire novel was wonderfully written.I think, at the time I first read it, I was sure that I had found the perfect guy. Riggs was like my first fictional crush. He was quite amazing.The cover is super duper pretty. I am giving it 5 stars. I mean, it just fits the style of the book.This book definitely deserves 5 stars. I would recommend this book to any historical and inspirational romance fans. Actually, I would recommend any of Lori Wick\u2019s books! A few of my favorites, other than this one, are Whatever Tomorrow Brings, The Hawk and the Jewel, and Wings of the Morning.Title: Every StormAuthor: Lori WickThis review is written in my own opinions and words.If you like this book you should definitely check out Sarah Sundin for her books. My personal favorite, for now is When Tides Turn. Check out my review here: When Tides Turn"}, {"userName": "Rochelle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16291294-rochelle", "userReview": "So I found this book at one of my favorite thrift stores and I could not pass it up, especially since it was only 25 cents! It's rare that I would see Lori Wick's name and not buy it. To begin with, the passage at the back of the book that was there for description purposes was quite misleading. I started it thinking the story was going to take place for the most part on an island. I thought I would be reading something akin to the Cary Grant movie Father Goose, one of my favorite movies. So I was very surprised when Lori jumped past the time spent on the island! Then the story kind of reminded me of another Cary Grant favorite of mine Operation Petticoat, but only for a small portion of time. Most of the book takes place in Southern California.When I think of describing the story, I think in terms of perfume. The base notes were very sad. For a large portion of the book the characters tears practically saturate through the pages. It was completely realistic, but realistically depressing. However, the top notes were adorable and cute, and everything I've come to expect from a world crafted by Lori Wick. You, the reader, grieve and grow with the characters, it's a journey that left my heart almost glowing with happiness in the end. The romance and relationships were SO incredibly sweet! The kind of sweet that makes you squeal with happiness. I loved it, I love Lori Wick's love stories. Her stories and characters make you want to be a better person."}, {"userName": "Ruslan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4683183-ruslan", "userReview": "A great Christian book. The story is very touching. I really enjoyed it. The only thing i had against it was its view on war. Two of the main characters in the story are soldiers who dont view fighting as sin. The Bible explicitly says that those who live by the sword will die by the sword. Killing is sin."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29831856-anna", "userReview": "Amazing.This book is so great, I can't even begin to describe it. I read it along with a friend who has already read and loved  Lori Wick's novels, but this was my first time diving into one of her books. Without a doubt in my mind this will not be the last book of hers I will love and cherish."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52498138-holly", "userReview": "Lorri, Rigg, Max, Ruth, Dean, Johnny, Arlene, Cora, Ellis, Lionel, and even Josie. Each of these sweet, kind, conflicted, heartbroken, Christian Characters warmed my heart. I grew close to them over the span of 354 pages. Usually I prejudge a book by it's first few chapters. Honestly I was about to give up on this one. The story was amazing and Lori Wick is an amazing writer. The only issue was that this genre doesn't usually interest me. I only ventured on because I knew my older sister loved this book and I didn't want to give up on it. I am so overjoyed that I gave it another chance!This book touched me emotionally and spiritually it reminded me to trust in God through all the trials of my life. I was thankful for the clean and heartfelt romance throughout it. So often I read books that focus on the attraction of the 2 main characters more so than the love that they have for each other. The love that is pure and holy, a love like Christ's. By the end of books I'm usually very sad that they are done. But with this one I am so satisfied with the ending. When I read the epilogue I almost cried with tears of joy! My heart was happy for the characters I loved so dearly. Please read this book if you ever have the pleasure to do so! It's inspiring and enjoyable! You will not be displeased."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4371743-candace", "userReview": "I love Lori Wick's books because Christian historical romantic fiction is pretty hard to find and she does it amazingly well. This story had a really exciting premise and beginning but didn't feel like it was there just to pull readers in and then let them down. The excitement and emotion of the story were palpable and I almost cried several times, which is rare. Wick expertly weaves in two tales of romance yet the values and characters of her main characters shine through as well. It's a fine line in writing Christian fiction to not make the characters seem like goody goody saint instead of real people. Wick's characters always feel like people I want to know and could know if I lived in their time. This setting is a little more current than her other novels but the story is just as awesome. Highly recommended"}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1219161-melissa", "userReview": "This book by Lori Wick was a wonderful read. The story is about a young woman who survives a plane crash and is rescued at sea by a PT boat. It is near the end of WWII and the soldiers aboard must get her to safety. The war comes to an end and Lorrie must learn how to move forward in the face of great pain. You will also meet her family as they struggle with her. It is a story of family and faith. I advise having a box of tissue nearby as there are many scenes that bring tears to the eye. I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Judine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1329403-judine", "userReview": "At last, at last, Lori Wick has written a novel set in the Homefront Era! Love this time period and love the story set up. Lorri is an attractive heroine in that she tries to be strong -- and succeeds -- but often feels she fails. While Donovan Riggs is the standard strong but sensitive Wick hero, it works well with the counterbalance of the John and Max (yes, Max is a girl) love story. The only thing missing was how Donovan was connected to Kate and Rigg (The Californians - there HAD to be a connection)."}, {"userName": "Nellie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4470138-nellie", "userReview": "1945 Rigg thought about his ideals as he'd entered the war. I was up for anything, but hadn't banked of finding a lone survivor of a plane crash on a deserted island, half starved to death.This book was clean, and wholesome. Christian author. However, I thought it was long-winded. It drug on in several areas. It could have been cut much shorter and been just fine. Several times is found myself confused about sentence structure...but over all a great book, and fantastic story line. I think the story was fresh and new.

It was interesting to read about a family starting in 1945 and how they started to recover after the warm. It makes me want to read a book that was actually written about that time rather then set in the time period to see what people were writing about then.Also, reading about the grandpa who burried his wife, son and granddaughter made me realize that my sister and I need to not do reckless things, because we can't put my grandpa through that!"}, {"userName": "Jill Twigg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7865986-jill-twigg", "userReview": "This was my very first Lori Wick book.

Rigg is one of my all-time favorite book men, the story is interesting and sweet, and I literally spent the entire book crying or smiling.

The characters are so sacchrine, you can't stand it. They worry not only about the feelings of others, but the feelings the feelings of others feel when they're feeling. I'm not kidding. NOBODY on earth is as 'polite' and 'considerate' as Wick's characters. And we're talking soldiers at sea in WWII, being bombed, seeing their first woman in over a year. \"Pardon me, miss. I'm being very careful not to look at you, let alone brush your arm accidentally.\" Or, \"You DANCED in the PRIVACY of your room? I am seriously concerned about this. It requires prayer. It could lead to carousing at a USO hall, and I'm so very troubled, dearest.\"2. Wick has this way of spending two chapters on a six-week shipwreck experience (including death, burials, starvation) but can write for chapter upon chapter about the heroine's sister's best friend's mother's cake. I'm not kidding you. She does this constantly. You want to know how the heroine felt on the island. What the crashed plane looks like, what the hopes and dreams were, where the Lieutenant's head was in all of this. You don't get it. You get to read about a kitten attacking a dog's tail, church potlucks, and shopping for blouses.3. There is no description. We never know what the Admiral grandpapa looks like, we barely get a description of the hero! Is Ellis older? Is Lionel black? Does Jack have a Southern drawl? NO description for most of the stuff you read in her books. Drives me crazy.Having said? This book takes the 'Amelia Earhart' story, WWII, and Christian luvvv and weaves it together to make a passable tale. I didn't hate it. I never love her books, but it... is something I can take and have interesting creative writing sessions of my own, from.
