I started reading Unqualified on Sunday, the same day I finished a book that I absolutely loved. I should have waited a day. I ruined this book for myself so take this review with a grain of salt.I'm not a fan of Anna Faris the actress. I've only seen 3 of her movies 2 of the Scary Movie films and Lost In Translation. Apparently she's on a tv show I've never even heard of and I watch A LOT of tv. So you may be asking why I picked this book up? Its because I've always liked her as a person and I'm a huge fan of her soon to be ex husband Chris Pratt. I'm not one if those people who jumped on The Chris Pratt Action Star bandwagon. I've loved Chris Pratt since Everwood and Parks & Rec. I actually preferred him chubby and after reading this book I think Anna did too. I felt really bad when I found out Chris & Anna were splitting up. I like most people jumped to the conclusion that Chris must have been the bad guy and cheated on her. I don't know for sure but seeing as she already has a boyfriend and she mentions several times that her relationships tend to overlap. I feel much better about Chris.It must be incredibly awkward to have a relationship advise book coming out on the heels of your divorce announcement. Its clear she wrote this book before deciding to get divorced. Unqualified reads like a love letter to her perfect marriage to her perfect husband. Its hella awkward! I've never written a book so I don't know if maybe it was simply impossible to do rewrites after the split or maybe she and Chris could have delayed the announcement of their divorce but it made reading this book very confusing. Overall I liked Anna and in turn I liked her book. Anna is weird, zany, sweet, goofily self-deprecating and a little insecure. It took a minute to get use to her writing style but once I did could enjoy it. Anna is a blunt and foulmouthed storyteller. I just wished she would have talked about the end of her marriage. If you love Anna & Chris read Unqualified but just know it will make you sad."}, {"userName": "Nat", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23381142-nat", "userReview": "The road that led me down to pick this book up is a funny one and can be mainly credited to one character: Andy Dwyer.\n So basically, I was in a funk of watching a bunch of Parks and Recreation videos that started off with this hilarious compilation of Chris Pratt bloopers that had me nearly choking with laughter, while simultaneously wiping away laugh-crying tears.I inevitably went down a rabbit hole of binge-watching clip after clip of Parks and Rec, and all this to say, I knew something productive would come of it because this whole preface led me to Unqualified by Anna Faris, since I recalled that Chris Pratt wrote the foreword, and after reading his words, I can only say: Andy would approve.\nSource.But the funny thing is, I quickly forgot all about the previous noise when I put on Anna\u2019s easygoing narrative-voice on audio (perfectly made for storytelling), which snared me in right away. I immensely enjoyed the window into her whirlwind world.Her comic memoir and first book,\u00a0Unqualified, will share Anna's candid, sympathetic, and entertaining stories of love lost and won. Part memoir, part humorous, unflinching advice from her hit podcast\u00a0Anna Faris Is Unqualified, the book will reveal Anna's unique take on how to navigate the bizarre, chaotic, and worthwhile adventure of finding love.The book showcases an honest firsthand account of despising high school (\u201cThe guiding question of my teenage years was simply, How do I survive this time in my life?\u201d), getting rejected from audition\u00a0roles (the most exciting\u00a0one to read about was the Friends audition that later led her to a much bigger role in the show), school-grade crushes (\u201cIt was that heady rush of young love that has no basis in logic at all.\u201d), marriage, family, sharing her \u201cpenchant for digging into other people\u2019s personal lives,\u201d and more on life and all its aspects.\u00a0I bonded over the many insights shared from Faris.The biggest compliment I can pay is that I was so into Unqualified that I continued dreaming about in my sleep, granted I stayed up listening till 1 am and slept for only five hours that night, but still.\u00a0This book reads of truth. Also, I'm glad I decided to listen to this on audio since her soft-spoken, calming voice has this subtle raspy factor to it that I came to appreciate.Other essays that stood out for me were about:\u2022 going to her high school reunion after twenty years and having her 90s romantic movie-worthy ending... just read this passage:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d been at the reunion for all of one hour, but it was long enough for me to feel like I was in high school again, and to be ready to get out. I mean, Green Day was pumping through the loudspeakers. Chris drove down and picked me up, as we\u2019d planned, and it did feel a bit like the lion rescuing the lioness from the hyenas. It was amazing to watch the reaction as he came through the door. I still felt like headgear-wearing, awkward Anna Faris, but when Chris came in, he was all movie star. There was a collective gasp as he whisked me away and, yes, that was fairly satisfying, I guess. I\u2019m human, after all.\u201d\u2022 her utterly moving chapter about her son, Jack Pratt. This was the most telling chapter in her memoir where I was continually taken off guard, and I applaud Anna Faris for her ineffable\u00a0strength and endurance. I felt all the things she described, from the terror of feeling her water break two months before she was due, to the boredom through her bed rest, and then the inevitable scenario of going into labor... All these high-intensity\u00a0moments stayed with me long after the last page.\u2022 unfolding the history behind Chris's fascination with learning to french braid, which had piqued my interest last year when I saw this post:\nSource\u201cMy mom loves to French braid my hair. It\u2019s a weird thing she does even now that I\u2019m an adult. But she always starts a little too high and I end up looking like a sister wife. Three or four years ago, Chris was watching her do a French braid and wanted to learn. He already knew how to do a regular braid because his sister taught him when they were kids, and he\u2019s into knots in general, from being an outdoorsy guy.\u201d\u2022 And last but not least, what's a memoir with sharing some blast from the past\u00a0photos?\n\u201c(I\u2019m the short one).\u201d\n\nMy knowledge of Anna Faris before reading this could be narrowed down to her character Cindy Campbell in Scary Movie (which I definitely shouldn't have watched at the age that I did), but after reading Unqualified, I feel like I've got a more solid perspective on her as a person, which is all I could've asked for. Bottom line: I love a good spot-on memoir I can be swept into.\nNote: I'm an Amazon Affiliate. If you're interested in buying\n Unqualified, just click on the image below to go through my link.

It was almost everything I thought I would get. Anna was really honest and straightforward. I thought that her personality shone through and she came out looking like a really likeable, hilarious and humble person. A lot of times, when I read other autobiographical books, I tend to actually like the person less at the end of the book. This wasn't the case with Anna and I actually found her to be very similar to me in some ways, while of course, vastly different in other ways. She's also so hilarious and that shows in her writing too. I thought that the whole thing was actually written very well and it was broken up into nice chapters that were sometimes hilarious and sometimes very personal. I thought that it was a very good mix. Before reading this I had never listened to her podcast before, and I thought maybe that might negatively affect my reading experience but in actuality I loved the little things that revolved around the podcast and it made me want to listen to it. And then there was the fact that a lot of it is about Chris Pratt. I was expecting that, obviously he was a very big part of her life and still is because they have a kid together, but I think this book was written before they decided to split up and so it was a little weird to read her gush over him so much. She did apparently take out some of the things about him but I was expecting a chapter on their split but it never came. I think the book release date was just bad timing (the book was officially released October 24th and they officially separated in mid-July) and it is unfortunate that that shadows over the book in a negative way. I would definitely recommend this book.-------------------------------------\u201cBut as an adult, I\u2019ve learned that closure is unobtainable. I think it happens at death, maybe.

But how was I to know?!It is basically a huge love letter to Chris Pratt. I have so many questions now. WHY are they separating? Is it still going to be published? Will she edit any of it? Will she write a new chapter? The title is an echo of her podcast which is the story of her life. She states that she's unqualified to give advice and yet she gives it in her podcast. She also says she's going to give it in this book and while there are a couple of teaching type moments where she imparts some advice it's almost never actionable advice. It's very tied in to her own experiences and not always generalized enough for a wider audience. I also had trouble with the flow of the book itself. It jumps around chronologically a bit too much, especially in the first half to three fourths. We hear about her first love and then several chapters later it returns to him and then to a time just after him several more chapters later. Interspersed or packets of her current life with glowing, glittery unicorn-husband (man-icorn), and adorable 5 year old son, Jack. I feel sorry for this kid if he ever reads this or his friends do because it has a lot about his mom's (and dad's) sex life in it.The fact that she was married when she and Chris Pratt got together is also kind of disappointing. I have vow standards. Admittedly, she called her husband who was in LA while she was in... Arizona? to tell him she was leaving him BEFORE going and boning CP but still. Maybe don't admit these things in press, lady.I enjoyed all mentions of the movies 'What's Your Number?' and 'The House Bunny\" because I love them. Also all insider tidbits on CP and tiny tiny glimpses at filmings of Jurassic World and GotG. Overall though, I found reading this to be sad. Because depending on when she wrote it, I think it was approximately the same time their marriage was imploding and it brings a whole even more depressing element to the fact that she's unqualified to be giving advice. Most of her advice is based on the, \"I have an amazing husband and you can too!\" vein and now she doesn't have that husband anymore. I can't imagine this is going to do well with the timing of their separation unless they somehow work things out before October when it's supposed to be released. I also wonder how much of their marriage ending is because of this book or because of the fact that she started seeing a therapist during writing or because of the fact that she is seriously jealous of his career trajectory (she claims not to be several times; a case of the lady protesting too much?)"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5889288-stephanie", "userReview": "Let me start off by saying I love Anna Faris and I love her podcast. Okay so here is why I only gave this two stars. This is a review of the Audio CD.1. She doesn't dig too deep into anything. I would've loved to hear more behind the scenes stories of her movie shoots. I feel like this book could've gone into more detail about everything she discussed. It felt like it was written by someone who had to write a school paper, had a deadline, but has no interest in their topic so they BSed most of it and hoped for the best. 2. She narrates the audiobook but I think she did it without any help, Let me explain, she pronounces short lived as short LIVEd as in \"LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT\" twice in the book on two different CDs. Either she did all the narrating alone and has no editor or anyone working with her felt too embarrassed to point it out. Once it happened the second time I was feeling gaslighted like maybe *I* have actually been pronouncing it wrong my entire life because surely a professionally published audiobook wouldn't have such a glaring mistake twice.3. More on the narration, she read the book in a really choppy way and it made it really distracting. You know what it was like? When you're a kid in school and the teacher makes everyone in the class read a paragraph out of the same book and some kids can't read well so. they. skip. like. this. like they are unsure about what they are even reading out loud. It was like she was reading out of a book she didn't write herself. Maybe I should've just read the actual book instead of listening to it. Sorry Anna."}, {"userName": "Kristy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126296-kristy", "userReview": "Anna Faris' memoir is based mainly on the premise of her podcast, also entitled Unqualified, in which she doles out advice to strangers whom she calls on her show. The idea is that Anna is, in fact, \"unqualified\" to give advice, but she'll do so anyway based on her life experiences. If you actually listen to her podcast, though, you quickly learn that she's pretty good at giving advice, and that she's also a funny and enjoyable person. The book expands on this, allowing Anna to answer some of the questions posed on her podcast (e.g., Dealbreakers), talk about her childhood and experience breaking in acting, and, yes, of course, her various relationships. Overall, the book feels pretty real and authentic. You quickly get an idea of the kind of person Anna seems to be--kind, funny, talented, and perhaps a little insecure. I'll admit that since I started listening to Anna's podcast, I've felt a kinship to her, and my review is obviously influenced by that. She's so down-to-earth and really damn funny on her podcast. I also love the idea that she lived in her head for much of her childhood, making up stories (it sounds a little familiar, you see). If you like Anna's podcast, it will be hard not to enjoy her book, although some of the chapters and stories will sound a bit familiar if you're a faithful listener. My love of Anna was only deepened by reading her book, which is quite readable and broken into simple, short chapters. We get glimpses into Anna's childhood, her first big relationship, a little insight into her big break with \"Scary Movie,\" and more. I relate to her on so many levels. We're both fascinated by other people's lives; never had a big group of female friends; have no patience for small talk; are not wedding people; possess an emotional defense built up from our parents; and enjoy calling the numbers on vehicles to report about truck drivers' good driving. She just happens to be a lovely, famous, wealthy actress, and I'm um, well, yes. Otherwise, we're the same, right? ;)Of course, the elephant in this review is Anna's recent split from her husband, Chris Pratt, who wrote the foreword to the book, which was apparently revised somewhat for publication. It's hard not to psychoanalyze Anna in light of her recent marriage breakup. You read about her self-admitted inability to admit failure and her tendency to jump from one relationship straight to the next. So much of the book is about Chris and their relationship, and it's a shame that it's a distraction from an enjoyable memoir about a really smart and talented woman, who should stand on her own merit, apart from her (soon-to-be-ex) husband. It's also heartbreaking to read these chapters where it sounds like they truly love each other--and where they got through the premature birth of their son together--and know they are no longer married. Overall, this is a fun, easy-to-read memoir. If you like Anna, her films, or her podcast, you'll probably enjoy this one. It's a quick read, full of lists, humorous moments, and short chapters, although there are definitely serious pieces, too. It really only made me like her more. 3.5+ stars.

It\u2019s this weird rule I have. To me, 3 stars is a pretty neutral standpoint. Anything lower and I feel like I\u2019m judging a person\u2019s life and memories, which just doesn\u2019t feel right. I mean, who am I to judge? Sure, if I was really captivated by someone\u2019s story, I might give it a higher rating, but, that doesn\u2019t happen too often. So, while Anna Faris\u2019s Unqualified was a \u2018meh\u2019 type of a book for me, I didn\u2019t have the heart to rate it any lower. Unqualified is advertised as being half memoir, half advice book. To be more specific, it\u2019s a relationship advice book (even though I\u2019m not entirely certain how serious this claim is meant to be taken). And, I\u2019ll be honest. The reason I wanted to read this book comes down to me being nosy. Sure, I like Anna Faris as an actress, and quite enjoy some of her movies, but, I\u2019ve never really followed her as a fan. I didn\u2019t even know that she had a podcast series (which this book is a spinoff of). In reality, I saw that this book was coming out just a few days after Anna Faris and Chris Pratt announced their separation, and, knowing that this was a book about relationships, I was curious to say the least. And, while I\u2019m not going to go on and speculate on the possible reasons for their separation, I will say that Unqualified does leave you wondering \u2018Why?\u2019. But, I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.In Unqualified, Anna Faris explores her past relationships (as well as some tidbits on her career and how she got into the business) and what she\u2019s learned from them. I guess this is where the \u2018advice\u2019 aspect of the book comes in. Although, I will say that it was hard to take much of Faris\u2019s life lessons to heart, because: 1) Half the time she\u2019s joking aroundAnd 2) The advice she does give is centred on very personal relationships/situations This may be why the book\u2019s called Unqualified. Faris claims that she\u2019s unqualified to give advice, but, insists that she\u2019s going to try anyway. However, I would argue that Unqualified is basically Anna Faris giving advice to herself. While some people might find some of her revelations insightful or funny, the nature of her advice is so personal, and she often says things like \u201cI guess I thought this because\u2026\u201d or \u201cI think I did this because\u2026\u201d. It reads like she\u2019s trying to work out who she was during the different stages of her life. Almost like she\u2019s going over her past relationships to gain a better understanding of how she got to where she is now. I\u2019m not saying that this is necessarily a bad thing, but, I wouldn\u2019t really call it advice. However, I did appreciate how open Faris was throughout the book. No topic was off-limits. She wasn\u2019t afraid to admit to the mistakes that she\u2019s made, and how these mistakes have made her into who she is today. It was interesting to read an autobiography where the author was willing to delve into really personal topics, instead of just scooting around them.Then there\u2019s the whole Chris Pratt aspect of the book. If anything, reading this book made me really confused. Faris constantly mentions how Pratt is such a wonderful husband, and how she\u2019s so happy that she\u2019s part of an amazing relationship. She even brings up (multiple times) what they plan to do when they retire from show business. While I realize that she must have been working on this book for a long time, it just left me with so many questions. Were they separated, or, on the verge of separation when she wrote parts of this book? Why are they separating when all she does is praise him and their relationship? What went wrong? Is she going to add an updated chapter once the book is published? I understand that none of this is anybody\u2019s business, but, it\u2019s just so odd. Here you are reading a book about this couple\u2019s \u2018great\u2019 relationship, and in reality, they aren\u2019t even together anymore. You can\u2019t help but ask these questions. And, unfortunately, these questions ended up plaguing my reading of Unqualified. Overall, I was expecting to like this book a lot more than I actually did. If you\u2019re a fan of Anna Faris, you\u2019ll probably enjoy it. If you\u2019re looking for a good book on relationship advice, you might want to look somewhere else.*I received an advanced reader's copy of this book through a Goodreads giveaway"}, {"userName": "Chelsey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3486092-chelsey", "userReview": "At the end of a memoir, it's easy to feel like that person is extremely relatable and down to earth.

Then I felt like an old lady bc I didn't realize that Anna Faris was in her 40s. For me, she will always be Cindy Campbell in the awesome  Scream  parody movie, Scary Movie. I loved that movie in college. What was nice about this book is it's not really a This is My Life book- it's moreso her podcast in book form. I didn't realize Anna had a podcast but I'm definitely going to be checking it out now. There were so many funny moments in this book, but there were also sweet and brutally real chapters. She discusses her struggles with infertility and then her frightening birth story with her son Jack, who was born 2 months premature. And then Chris. Oh the stories about Chris Pratt. Anna and Chris have always been my favorite celeb couple and I was seriously so bummed when they split up.

But I know Anna Faris. I actually also know that she's Ah-Na, because she's in Key & Peele's Keanu and they pronounce her name in it. But I didn't read her book because of that. The only reason I picked this up is because I wanted to know if she would talk about her cat and her dog. Lots of essays, no mention of the cat at all. One mention of her pugs, but none of the chihuahua. So, I already didn't like either her or Chris Pratt. And she doesn't endear herself in this book, in fact, the opposite. She seems like a combination of both low and high self esteem, and it's uniquely annoying. She's not a good writer - please lay off the dear reader thing, the only book I'll tolerate it in is in Jane Eyre - and she doesn't have a whole lot to say. Her big epiphany, that she latched herself to a new guy each time she left a boyfriend in a futile quest for closure, would have meant something I guess, if the tabloids aren't talking about her house hunting with her new man barely half a year after her split with Pratt.

I laughed at a couple parts, and the foreword by Chris Pratt made me laugh out loud, but it seemed like any anecdote that was supposed to be a joke ended early before the punchline or wasn\u2019t milked for all its funniness. And I don\u2019t understand why there were so many chapters that consisted of random relationship advice from podcast fans from Facebook. This advice didn\u2019t seem to have any place in a book that would be way more interesting as just a memoir. I think it was meant to be a way to translate the premise of the podcast into book form, but it made the book feel choppy, and most of the advice consisted of cliches with no context. There were also many, many iterations of \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m writing a book!\u201d throughout the entirety of the book. So, even though I\u2019m absolutely unqualified to give this advice, I think she should delete all of those parts because they are unnecessary."}, {"userName": "Cortney", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50644930-cortney", "userReview": "Anna is very real, very real and very raw. She is not one to sugarcoat and she truly says the things that are on her mind or based on her mood. For a non confrontational person, she is very outgoing and curious. Some of her experiences were hilarious and the outcomes of her experiences prove to be even more entertaining.I found her curiosity intriguing and also really enjoyed how her journey into writing a memoir pushed her farther and opened up her eyes to things she never realized were even there. Her self esteem and self awareness was dismal. It was sad, but it was true and again real. She talks about Hollywood and the fact that we are all parents just wanting the best for our children, no matter what our professions are. She truly humanized herself and other entertainers. It was a remarkable read. I felt like I was having a conversation with my best friend.Chris was also a good husband, and they were very supportive of each other.

It was supposedly meant to impart some relationship and life advice on the reader; however, advice was few and far between, and what little she did offer was kinda shitty! She\u2019d be like \u201chere\u2019s a story about something I did/some guy!\u201d and then that would be it. No reflection on the story or how it shaped her decisions later on.

Anna Faris is well known for her movies, her podcast, and her marriage to Chris Pratt. This book was written prior to the announcement that Faris & Pratt are separating. Since there are many references to Chris and their marriage, much of the narrative is suspect at best and heartbreaking at worst. Having said that, Faris fills her memoir with amusing personal anecdotes. She doesn't dance around her sexual history or her drug & alcohol use, but rather translates her experiences into advice for young men and women about love and relationships. Interspersed with her personal stories/advice are bits of advice from her followers/listeners. It's very clear why Anna (rhymes with Donna) is so popular and such an endearing celebrity. She's candid about herself, her shortcomings, and her advantages as a celebrity. Her writing is clear and very readable, showcasing her English degree. A year ago I would be praising this book, and it's probably unfair to judge it in light of recent events. Publication is poorly timed. I hope readers will overlook the headlines and read this memoir filled with cautionary tales and logical advice. Thank you, NetGalley, for giving me the opportunity to read Faris' memoir."}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12152709-kara", "userReview": "I am not quite sure why I finished this book.

Feels like I get to hang out with them for a few hours. Maybe after listening to this book, I\u2019ll be able to finally pronounce her name correctly.... it\u2019s NOT Ann-uh, it\u2019s Ahn-ah, rhymes with Donna. This book was so funny and so honest. Ms. Faris gives her whole life history and talks about all of her relationships. Sometimes TMI where Anna would give her whole sexual history and discussed her first time. She has a podcast, also called UNQUALIFIED, where people write or call in for advice and she shares her favorite of those stories. Anna also tells how she got into acting and how she felt through her rise to fame. But she also gives funny lists like this one:List to Live By: Sex on the Beach and 13 other things that sound better than they are1. Getting a book deal2. Gaspacho = it\u2019s soup that is cold3. Hot Buttered Rum4. Backpacking around Europe5. Driving across the country in an RV6. Sex on the Beach7. Or in a hot tub8. Or in a car9. Meeting strangers at a gas station 10. Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail11. Menage a Trois 12. Waterbeds13. Game night14. Couples Massage I really enjoy what a REAL person she is. Anna Faris is a regular person, just like the rest of us. I could relate to her because we have the same views on breast implants. It sucks to grow up and never really have breasts develop. But it\u2019s great to know that guys were never dating her for her boobs. So then it feels a little awkward or superficial to get breast implants at age 29. But just like Anna, I didn\u2019t want huge fake breasts. I just wanted them to be balanced to my figure. Most people would never know if I didn\u2019t tell them, just like we probably wouldn\u2019t know Anna had them if she hadn\u2019t already been famous as an actress. And just one surgery that isn\u2019t over the top is no big deal. Give this book a listen to hear Anna\u2019s honest views on herself. She\u2019s very grounded and humble.

I would love to hear her narrate a Sophie Kinsella type book since it would be awesome. I finished it quickly and thoroughly enjoyed it. The book is especially haunting in a way since she talks a lot about her relationship with Chris Pratt. She does talk about happier times and how they got together and some details of their marriage. When it was written, I\u2019m not sure that they knew they were separating. Chris Pratt\u2019s foreword was wonderful and written post-split but with love and generosity toward Anna.

I guess that makes many think they have a license or duty to tell people all kinds of private information that is better left unsaid (at least in my opinion.) I really, really like Anna Faris. I think she is a good actress, I love her show \"Mom\" and I think she is gorgeous. I also tend to think of her as being more than the usual Hollywood narcissist. But, I didn't like 'Unqualified' as much as I thought I would. She is extremely open...how many men with whom she has slept, her past relationships, Chris Pratt, her parents, her medical issues. Not all of it is as interesting as one would think. Although there is nothing wrong with telling anyone the most intimate details of your life, I think most people find it distasteful. As the great Fran Lebowitz once stated, \"Vomiting your feelings is about as attractive as it sounds.\" I would have loved to have read more about her show than her sex life and bodily functions."}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91455-renee", "userReview": "I should have known by the cover (yes, you can judge a book by its cover) of a lovely, dazed and confused Anna Faris rubbing her head like an accident victim that this memoir would not be for me.Faris truly seems like a modest, kind person who is genuinely interested in others and well grounded despite her life as an actress. That said, niceness does not make for an interesting read. A huge pet peeve of mine is when a writer feels the need to fill their book with lists and Faris does not disappoint as she randomly inserted lists of \"would you rather\", and \"embarrassing things my father did\" throughout the book. It comes down to filler; nothing more.

At around 180 or so, I checked out of the book, mostly for content. I didn't have a good feeling from when I first started reading it because the introduction started with \"I'm not qualified to write a book.\" I think that's a disservice to your readers and to people who purchased it. Another chapter started with \"I'm halfway through and I still have about one hundred pages left to fill with ... what?\" That much was clear, I'd really hoped that she would gone deeper into things rather than the traditional \"I was so awkward as a kid/teenager etc.,\" I'd hoped for more vulnerability and honesty, especially when that was repeated nearly ever chapter.

It was so cute that he braided her hair for her and then posted it on social media with the caption \u201creal men braid hair.\u201d It sounded like they tried to have as normal of a life as possible.

You are many in a row of starlet actresses who write books that make me go, Why does this even exist? But I read them anyway, because: 1. They are so so so easy and fun to read2. Sometimes you get a sprinkling of celebrity gossip3. They make me feel like I could maybe be friends with themThis checked all of those boxes to me, but it doesn't do much else. I've listened to quite a bit of Anna's \"Unqualified\" podcast, and this book is a lot like that. I think that's why I liked it more than I would have otherwise, because it's a really entertaining podcast. Also, Anna is very sweet and personable in the book, like she is on the podcast. I truly believe she's a good-natured person and her book was an enjoyable way to pass the time.However, a lot (A LOT) of the book feels like filler. It's just conversations with her friends and random comments Anna makes about life in general (many of which are kinda strange) and then all these advice tidbits from her podcast listeners. And even though it's not its fault, you can't help but feel cringey knowing that Anna and Chris divorced soon after the book was released, but definitely not before it was written. Sad.I gave this book a 3 because I liked it more than Amy Poehler's book and WAY more than Anna Kendrick's book, but not nearly as well as Lauren Graham's book Talking As Fast As I Can, which was one of my favorite books that I read last year.
