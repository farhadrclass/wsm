What else can I say about this book to give it justice?This is a chillingly terrifying story that has nothing to do with the things that go BUMP in the night. No, it's the odd terror that comes when things go BUMP in the mind. And the most terrifying things are those that are left unsaid, that creep up at you from behind the printed lines, just hinted at and left for your own brain to chillingly realize.\n\u201cMy name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all, I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else in our family is dead.\u201d \nBehind the events of the story is the mystery of the Blackwood family, rich New England landowners who are quite well-aware of their presumed class-snobbish superiority over the inhabitants of the nearby village; the family which is in turn met with distrust, fear and even hatred - not quite unfounded, actually. You see, six years ago half of the members of the Blackwood family were poisoned by arsenic in their food. Three are left: Uncle Julian, left crippled by the poison, hanging on to the remnants of his mind, obsessed with the tragedy of the day of the murder; Constance, an agoraphobiac trapped in the narrow confines of her domestic universe, cooking for the remnants of her family with a strained chirpy attitude - a young woman who was also the cook on the day of the fateful arsenic poisoning and therefore is considered the poisoner in the eyes of the villagers; and Mary Katherine, Merricat, the narrator of the story, now eighteen, who was sent to her room without dinner on the day of the poisoning, who now serves as a link between her diminished and scorned family and the rest of the world.For a careful reader, the identity of the poisoner is really very easy to figure out after the first few pages. The psychological impact is never about the identity, it's about the implications of it. And that's what gives it a real punch.\n\u201cI am going to put death in all their food and watch them die.\u201d\nThis strange little family survives without ever deviating from their strict routines, remaining shut off from the outside world until one day an unexpected arrival threatens the fragile stability - of the family and of Merricat's mind. And the events that follow lead to the scariest and saddest ending presented in the most chillingly subtle way possible.\n\u201cI would have liked to come into the grocery some morning and see them all, even the Elberts and the children, lying there crying with the pain of dying. I would help myself to groceries, I thought, stepping over their bodies, taking whatever I fancied from the shelves, and go home, with perhaps a kick for Mrs.Donell while she lay there. I was never sorry when I had thoughts like this; I only wished they would come true.\"\n\nOur narrator, Merricat Blackwood, is not a character you can easily forget. She is written with such skill, with such vividness, with such persuasion that the pages come alive with her bizarre voice of a seemingly adult woman forever trapped in neverending childhood, in the world of twisted magical reality of strange rituals and special objects and strict routine that can never be changed, or else.\n\"On Sunday morning the change was one day nearer. I was resolute about not thinking my three magic words and would not let them into my mind, but the air of change was so strong that there was no avoiding it; change lay over the stairs and the kitchen and the garden like fog. I would not forget my magic words; they were MELODY GLOUCESTER PEGASUS, but I refused to let them into my mind.\"\nAnd the scariest thing of all to me was how more and more enthralling Merricat's voice became with every page, with every minute spent inside her head, until it's hard not to take her side despite all the implications that it carries, despite reason suggesting otherwise, despite knowledge of what's going on. And that's when you realize the magnetic pull Merricat has, holding her little world together in the ways that suit her - little world it may be, but it's wholly her own, steadily holding against anything that can be perceived as a disturbance, an interference, a threat. And the words of her little game in the summerhouse take on a new resonance.\n \u201cBow your heads to our beloved Mary Katherine\u2026or you will be dead.\u201d\nI found this book deeply disturbing in its deceiving simplicity, and scarily engrossing - the book written by an oddball ostracized agoraphobiac obsessed with food and trapped in her own little universe by the last years of her life. Shirley Jackson's Constance and Merricat, securely huddled in their own little corner of the world, not accepted but feared and left alone, the heart of legends and superstitions - was it in a way a cry for help or an unattainable dream? I don't know, and I think I sleep better precisely because I don't know.Unflinching 5 stars and a shudder at the seemingly so innocent of an ending:\u201cOh Constance, we are so happy.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Bill  Kerwin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83582-bill-kerwin", "userReview": "This book is a masterpiece. It is short and spare and written in crystal clear prose, yet so evocative that it is richer in nuance than most good novels twice its size. It is so good I could kick myself for not reading it years ago, yet so mythic I am convinced I have known it always, like a tragic folktale or a chilling childhood dream. And yet, for all its grimness, it is essentially a comedy: darkly, transcendently, funny.The Blackwood sisters\u201428-year-old Constance and 18-year-old Mary Katharine\u2014live in a big old house on the outskirts of town. They are fitfully persecuted by the locals, who are convinced one of them is a murderer: their whole family\u2014with the exception of scatterbrained Uncle Julian\u2014was poisoned with arsenic six years ago. Now the three survivors\u2014along with their black cat Jonas\u2014are living together in deliberate tranquility, when long-lost cousin Charles arrives on their doorstep, barely concealing his interest in the lovely Constance and the Blackwood family estate.The narrative voice of Merrycat\u2014nickname for Mary Katherine\u2014is perhaps the most distinctive thing about the novel. Deceptively childlike, obsessed with omens, magic words, and lucky days, Merrycat is nevertheless a clear and sharp-eyed observer of the day-to-day events of her world. Her naive shrewdness speaks to us like Huckleberry Finn\u2019s, her quirkiness charms us like Holden Caulfield\u2019s, yet she possesses a distance, a reserve, that is all her own.Those of you who read novels like autobiographies will find tantalizing tidbits here. The local village resembles Jackson\u2019s North Bennington, Vermont, a place Jackson always felt treated her family as outsiders (college eggheads, Democrats, atheists, Jews) and provided her the inspiration for her notorious early success, \u201cThe Lottery\u201d. The two sisters were inspired by Jackson\u2019s two daughters, the placid and cautious Constance by Joanne and the superstitious and daring Merrycat by Sarah. But of course Jackson drew on herself for inspiration too, particularly from her fascination with witchcraft and sympathetic magic and her persistent, crippling agoraphobia. And Cousin Charles resembles her husband, in his critical comments about the housekeeping and his continual concerns about money. (Although husband Stanley was a literary critic, his wife Shirley was the literary cash cow of family, and he once calculated precisely how much money was lost whenever his wife wasted her valuable time composing a letter to a friend.)Perhaps what I like best about the book\u2014besides the dark humor, and the voice of Merrycat of course\u2014is its sweet and sad conclusion. After the destruction has passed and gone\u2014a climax which reveals the full impact of the novel\u2019s title\u2014we witness a family rebuild an old life out of love, and even glimpse a little human compassion for a change. It is the twilight happiness of Shakespeare\u2019s Winter\u2019s Tale and The Tempest, the kind of happiness Lear and Cordelia might have enjoyed, if they had lived.Here is the novel\u2019s famous first paragraph, which gives you a good idea of Merrycat\u2019s distinctive voice:\nMy name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had.

A masterpiece of unreliable narration and of the eerie relationship between childishness and horror.I'm now re-reading this for a December group read, so I thought I'd update this review as I go.A lot has already been written about the masterful opening paragraph of this book, so I'll focus instead on the opening chapter. It basically involves the narrator, Merricat, walking into town to do some shopping. Sounds boring? It's anything but that. Shirley Jackson uses this mundane task to show the intense hostility between the Blackwood family and the town, as well as to show Merricat's rather unusual character. She's childish and playful: \"I played a game when I did the shopping. I thought about the children's games where the board is marked into little spaces and each player moves according to a throw of the dice.... The library was my start and the black rock was my goal.\" And as she navigates this terrain full of landmines in the form of other people who taunt her and laugh at her, she can't help flashing her own hostility: \"They saw me at once, and I thought of them rotting away and curling in pain and crying out loud; I wanted them doubled up and crying on the ground in front of me.\" Until at last she reaches the sanctuary of her home.It's a sanctuary that's as much magical as physical: \"I had to put down the shopping bag to open the lock on the gate; it was a simple padlock and any child could have broken it, but on the gate was a sign saying PRIVATE NO TRESPASSING and no one could go past that.\" And then she sees the most important person in her life, her sister Constance, and her Uncle Julian--the last surviving members of her family.***But almost immediately, that sanctuary is violated. Helen Clarke and Mrs. Wright come to tea, and we see Merricat fretting over what this will do to Constance, whether she's strong enough for visitors. There's a jealousy in Merricat that reminds me of the jealousy Eleanor has regarding Theodora in The Haunting of Hill House--a subterranean feeling that comes out in flashes of anger, like when Merricat smashes the milk pitcher in the kitchen.The scene with Helen Clarke and Mrs. Wright is also notable for its comedy--how everyone keeps dancing around the subject of the family deaths, except that Mrs. Wright can't help herself, she really wants to know, and Uncle Julian is more than happy to oblige by giving a guided tour of the dining room. Shirley Jackson has quite a comic touch here, though it's all undergirded by Merricat's ill-feelings toward these visitors and the recognition of the horrifying tragedy that befell her family.***Shirley Jackson expertly ratchets up the tension by having Merricat sense something impending: \"A change was coming, and nobody knew it but me.\" What's wonderful about this is that it raises the tension level even as you wonder whether something really is coming or whether she's just living in her own imagination. It also allows for some domestic scene-setting and banter with Uncle Julian without losing the narrative drive. I love when Merricat chooses three special protective words, thinking that \"so long as these great words were never spoken aloud no change would come.\" She then writes the first word in jam on her toast and eats it--thinking that makes her \"one-third safe\"!***The change, of course, is cousin Charles, who arrives without much explanation and basically moves in. It's clear right away that he's a gold-digger, and you can sense Merricat's rising anger and panic as he threatens her entire world by threatening to marry Constance. She employs her childish form of \"magic\" to try to ward him off or get him to leave, but nothing works, sending her spiraling into extremes. It's clear that Merricat thinks of him as the enemy when she watches him walk into town and talk easily to all the townsfolk who've been bullying her. He's one of \"them,\" in her mind, and at that point the battle lines harden.***One of the subtle mysteries of this book concerns the relationship between Merricat and Uncle Julian. My GR friend Nancy first pointed out, in a group discussion, that they don't really interact, except that Merricat keeps saying to herself that she ought to be nicer to him. I thought this was quite a profound insight, so I read the passages again more closely and noticed the same oddity. Uncle Julian says at one point that Merricat is dead, and then when Uncle Julian dies, Merricat hardly seems upset at all. In fact, she seems rather relieved, claiming that now she and Constance can start over again. Clearly there's something odd going on between them. My guess is that Merricat feels jealous of Uncle Julian, that she really wants Constance all to herself. [Spoiler alert to the end] Perhaps this is also a clue to the motivation behind the central crime--that it was really driven by Merricat's jealous desire to have her sister all to herself. Here again I see shades of Eleanor from The Haunting of Hill House.***And finally, at the end, Merricat gets exactly what she wants--Constance all to herself. And Constance herself gives herself to Merricat's superior power, gives up any hope of having her own life. She cries as Charles leaves for the last time and says: \"Merricat, I am so happy.\" And Merricat herself echoes this sentiment in the book's final chilling line: \"Oh Constance,\" she says, \"we are so happy.\""}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "You will be wondering about that sugar bowl, I imagine.

We watch children, young and naive, signing and spinning in a corn field bathed by an autumn dusk; the cliche works because it is an image that we welcome through our front door for it\u2019s familiar and idyllic pastoral sentimentality only to discover an intangible fear clawing out from within. It\u2019s the murky pool from which the maggots of urban legends crawl forth and every town has one. There is the house on the corner children dare one another to touch, the homeless man we hear bears a horrific curse, the school basement where we are told a student once hanged themselves and still roams about (two of the three existed in my childhood town). Often these legends are purely of the imagination, yet occasionally there is a seed of truth. Shirley Jackson's We Have Always Lived in the Castle focuses on the subjects of the urban legend seed, and holds the reader captive in their reclusive reality. The reader however, will not wish to leave this literary bondage and will likely find themselves sitting up flipping pages late into the evening. Two young woman and their ailing uncle are the sole occupants a mansion set off from the town, the sole survivors of a family poisoning that reverberates through the town with rumors and speculative fear. Castle is a chilling late-night walk through the haunted forests of human consciousness, a gripping psychological horror ripping through the idyllic American classic feel of the novel to expose the Gothic terrors that drench the New England landscapes.We always fear what we don\u2019t understand. What makes Castle work so well is it\u2019s familiarity and it\u2019s warmth, an unexpected aspect to this chilling portrait of misanthropy. The novel humanizes the subjects of the townsfolk\u2019s fear and revulsion, and it does so without apology by not skirting the issues of murder and isolation. Jackson sets the reader into this world without making them feel ill at ease through her style, a familiar embrace of tone and structure which recalls the small town American classics. It seemed to follow the format of a book you would read for high school literature, opening with a riveting first chapter that quickly yet eloquently set all the pieces in play while feeding you exposition hidden in the sugars of plot and leaving you gasping with questions you can\u2019t wait to have fulfilled. Then it is followed by a second, lengthier chapter where an overarching conflict is introduced, typically through a minor conflict in plot where more exposition is unveiled through the banter of characters. It\u2019s this sort of nostalgia for high school classics that immediately opens your heart to the book, but not just in structure but the plot, setting and characters as well. Harper Lee\u2019s To Kill A Mockingbird is the first to come to mind. Like Lee, Jackson tells her story from the viewpoints of a young, tomboyish girl and wraps her tale within the folds of local politics and society. Here we have Mary Katherine, or Merricat as she is often referred, a girl of eighteen akin to a feral cat. Her and her sister Constance are embedded in the local society, but from a view on high being born into a family of wealthy landowners. Merricat, despite her disgust for her deceased relatives, continues their looking-down-the-nose opinions of the locals as filth except hers is one of violent hatred.\nI would have liked to come into the grocery store some morning and see them all, even the Elberts and the children, lying there crying with the pain and dying. I would then help myself to groceries, I thought, stepping over their bodies, taking whatever I fancied from the shelves, and go home, with perhaps a kick for Mrs. Donell while she lay there. I was never sorry when I had thoughts like this; I only wished they would come true.\nMerricat\u2019s opening chapter is unabashedly honest, but doesn\u2019t quite read like a confession but more as matter-of-fact. Like a cat\u2014it is fitting that Merricat is always accompanied by a loyal and almost-too-human cat as if it were a children\u2019s novel\u2014Merricat is the sort to look you straight in the eye while she destroys the furniture. Which she will do time and time again out of spite.\"I can't help it when people are frightened,\" says Merricat. \"I always want to frighten them more.\"Merricat has many reasons beyond her better-than-thou upper-class upbringing to sadistically sneer at the townsfolk. They hate her and her older sister, reviling Constance for allegedly getting away with mass murder, they hate their family for former wounds caused by the snobbish and cruel father, and they take their disgust out with ridicule. Eventually, as events transpire, the sisters take on a sort of legend for their reclusive behavior and disregard for the company of villagers, being said to eat children among other things. The sisters are a symbolic repression of women and all things not aligning with the social norms of any age, damned into either shame or blissful solitude as rumors take wing and transform into hellish mythical beasts.Poor strangers, they have so much to be afraid of.By focusing on the sisters and viewing the world through Merricat\u2019s childish and imaginative mind, we gain a unique perspective on the society. The children signing sadistic rhymes of horror films are in this perspective are the well-to-do well-wishers that feign friendliness towards the sisters. Both sides of this coin are seemingly innocent moments cloaking something sinister. When the disgust of the townsfolk reaches a violent climax, the sisters are further forced out from society towards a perspective that even the legitimate kind gesture must be ignored as to forever remove themselves from such a volatile society. Returning to the Merricat\u2019s mind, it is her twisted perspective that most brilliantly colors the social portrait. For her any deviation from her comfortable normality is seen as threatening\u2014a parallel to the social standards of the town that see their deviation as threatening\u2014and Merricat feels imbued with magical powers that ward off such demons.\nAll our land was enriched with my treasures buried in it, thickly inhabited just below the surface with my marbles and my teeth and my colored stones, all perhaps turned to jewels by now, held together under the ground in a powerful taut web which never loosened, but held fast to guard us.\nAn old book nailed to a tree, for example, becomes a totem of power to her. When it falls so does her feeling of security. She is the wild human consciousness repressed, regressed and full of animalistic defensiveness. It is fitting that Jackson would choose New England as the setting for her novel, a novel that if it weren\u2019t for the mention of cars could be set in nearly any New England era. The novel recalls the witch hunts of the area in all its Gothic sensibilities. What better place for a chilling tale told in the American wilderness. It is also reflective of the obdurate beliefs of a conservative catholic New England that so threatened Jackson and her Jewish husband that Jackson developed extreme agoraphobia.While out on my delivery route, I listen to a lot of NPR. This fall the Diane Rehm show did a segment on Jackson\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House, a quintessential literary haunted house novel that I so loved in college. Comically, and much to the chagrin of the guests\u2014two people well versed in the life and literature of Jackson\u2014Ms Rehm openly hated the novel, even sighing when callers would label it as \u2018wonderful\u2019 or \u2018genius\u2019. At one point, the two guests agreed that We Have Always Lived in the Castle was Jackson\u2019s strongest work of fiction (which places it even higher for them than her short story The Lottery, which is a staple of any American college student\u2019s required literature courses)\u00b9. I immediately made an unofficial stop to a used bookstore I'd recently discovered (I have a least one bookstore for route that I rotate through) and purchased a copy of Castle. It did not disappoint. It was a fine friend to have riding shotgun amidst the landscapes disrobing themselves of their fall colors that passed outside my van windows every day.

Too often an author will distill the essence of insanity into the chaotic, and this is rarely a truism. Insanity is more often an overly-demanding focus, a hitch in a character, a mannerism that has growth as a cancer.

That is what reading this novel was like, in all of the best ways possible. Shirley Jackson is a renowned master at the macabre, the unnerving, the Gothic genre, and this work puts her talents on full display\u2014in HD. Most have read \"The Lottery,\" whether forced by the classically inclined high school English teacher or for the pure love of the unusual, and here you will find the same masterful foreshadowing, biting eeriness and haunting cruelties found in a small-town community. As my Grandma used to say, \u201cYou can always count on those ole\u2019 townies to hide the most secrets, put on the most airs and turn on ya the quickest,\u201d and Jackson, once again, highlighted those small-town characteristics in a manner that left hairs raised on the arms and resonance echoing at the finish of each chapter.We Have Always Lived in the Castle is a novel about two young adult sisters, Mary Katherine and Constance, who have essentially become lepers in their small town after an incident at their family dinner table six years before that left half of their family poisoned to death, one sister on trial for murder and the other in an orphanage. The women go about their lives, hardly ever even leaving their property and being openly hated by the townspeople, kept company by their ailing, eccentric uncle who loves to talk about \u201cwhat happened\u201d and their loyal cat, until one day a cousin comes a knocking and their lives are forever changed. It slowly becomes apparent that Merricat (Mary Katherine) is not 100% mentally stable, as she believes she has voodoo-like magical powers to protect herself, her family and her home, she has fantasies about how her dead family members should have treated her before they died, and she harbors obviously sadistic and murderous feelings towards the townspeople who tease and abuse them.\u201cI would have liked to come into the grocery store some morning and see them all, even the Elberts and the children, lying there crying with the pain and dying. I would then help myself to groceries, I thought, stepping over their bodies, taking whatever I fancied from the shelves, and go home, with perhaps a kick for Mrs. Donell while she lay there.\u201d This story had an aspect of urban legend to it, the makings of it and the effect that it has on those who hear it, who believe it. Jackson wove the tale so beautifully that I didn\u2019t even realize how engrossed in their lives\u2014a sign of truly good writing\u2014I\u2019d become until the cousin started changing the sisters\u2019 routine and poking his nose around in that way that is uncomfortable for readers invested in the protagonists, in that way that makes your heart rate quicken just a touch. This story was a peep behind closed doors, both literally and figuratively. It was a look inside the protective bubble of recluse-ness, while simultaneously being an exploration of man\u2019s nature to fear and hate what we do not, ourselves, understand. It was also social commentary in that delicious way that only Southern Gothicism can offer (though this novel has no clear mention of place, it is widely believed to have been set in Vermont, making it technically not Southern Gothic, though every other aspect of it is every bit that genre): it tore back the layers on the small town where everyone knows your name, on the myth of genteelism, courtesy, manners, and community that we all think of from this era of writing (Castle was originally published in 1962). What does it mean to be an outsider in a town like this, in a town where there is no degree of separation between any? In a town that needs a common enemy to unite over in gossip and violence alike? Because, you see, every bully loves a weaker kid, and there\u2019s nothing more cruel than the mob mentality turned against a common enemy. Don\u2019t believe me? Then you haven\u2019t read \"The Lottery.\"Castle was everything I\u2019d hoped it\u2019d be as a lover and writer of this genre. It was the macabre dressed in politesse that made you think twice\u2014a skill extremely difficult to hone and, thus, all the more laudable when it is\u2014the oddity of family unity and where those bonds can take you, for better or for worse; it was the sharp little dagger of lines like the one above and the what-really-happened-there aspect of the dinner-table happening.\u201cIt did happen.

There is no doubt that Jackson was a master of vivid imagery. Even if the story was beautifully drawn, there was nothing here that caught my eye. Look at it this way - you can paint the most realistic image of a cantaloupe, a piece of artwork that looks as if you can just reach out and grab one of those gorgeous melons and bite right into that fucker, but at the end of the day, it's only a picture of a fucking cantaloupe. This is possibly my hang up because I was expecting my testicles to explode because of awesome overload and instead they only began tingling slightly.

This is a brief statement at the very starting point of the speech, sufficiently interesting so that the audience will immediately sit up and take notice. It is the \"hook\" with which the speaker snares them.I have found that this works very well in narrative fiction too. If the first paragraph is sufficiently interesting, the reader continues long enough to get pulled into the story. While this is not essential, many great novels have great opening paragraphs (Pride and Prejudice, To Kill a Mockingbird, One Hundred Years of Solitude, The Jewel in the Crown... these are some examples which immediately come to mind. Now, I will add this novel also to the list.My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all, I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else in our family is dead.Mary Katherine Blackwood, or \"Merricat\" as she is nicknamed, is the child-woman narrator of this extremely disturbing novel by Shirley Jackson. As the novel opens, only three members of the rich Blackwood family are surviving: Merricat, her elder sister Constance, and their ailing uncle Julian. The remaining members - Merricat's father, mother, younger brother Thomas and Julian's wife Dorothy are all dead of arsenic poisoning which happened six years ago. Constance, who cooked on the day, has been tried and acquitted. She survived because she did not take sugar on her blackberries, the medium in which the arsenic was administered: Merricat survived because she was sent to bed without supper in disgrace (something which happened quite often): and Julian survived, even though he was affected, because he took less of the sugar. Constance falls under suspicion because she was the cook, did not take the contaminated food, and washed the bowl in which it was kept before it could be forensically examined.As a person who cut his milk-teeth on Agatha Christie, the identity of the murderer was evident to me after a few pages: and I don't think Ms. Jackson's aim was to write a mystery at all. For the duration of this short novel, we are forced to live in the mind of the seriously disturbed narrator, a child trapped inside a woman's body. It is through her eyes that we see the other characters and the world in general. This is like seeing things in a \"funny mirror\" - it distorts and provides a weird sort of clarity at the same time, by emphasising certain aspects out of proportion.Constance does not venture forth outside the house at all: and Uncle Julian is an invalid eccentric, who keeps on writing about that fateful day six years ago, over and over. The villagers, in true Shirley Jackson style, are frighteningly evil: they hate the Blackwoods - originally because of their privileged status, then more openly after the poisoning incident. Because they feel they can vent their anger openly now, they taunt Merricat mercilessly while she does her shopping. The Blackwoods' \"own set\", the moneyed people like the Clarkes and the Carringtons, show token sympathy for them; but when we look at them through the narrator's distorted lens, we see only show and a morbid curiosity.The family continues to live in their big house, cut off from the villagers, \"protected\" by the magical talismans installed at various places around the grounds by Merricat, when their peaceful life is shattered by the arrival of cousin Charles, the son of Merricat's father's elder brother, who disowned them after the incident. Charles is ostensibly there to help them reintegrate into society: the real reason is money, which the Blackwoods have in plenty. Constance is charmed by Charles but the eccentric Julian and the disturbed Merricat can see through the subterfuge.The story moves towards its frightening climax as Charles and Merricat lock horns with increasing mutual antagonism. And when it comes, it is devastating in the extreme - but it is in the resolution that Ms. Jackson really displays her mastery over the medium. Instead of a blast and the subsequent silence, we are left with a smouldering fire which will haunt us for days to come.***Darkness is always present in our midst. Most of the time, we shove it under the carpet as it is not a nice thing to look at. Writers and artists sometimes feel it more strongly, which is why we get painters like Frieda Kahlo and authors like Shirley Jackson.The feminine is seen as mysterious, dark and moist (I am talking here of archetypes; the stuff of myths and dreams, not actual women). I have seen that women authors (Daphne du Maurier, Emily Bront\u00eb et al) have a much better connection to this part of the human psyche. This is possibly why the mythical goddesses are more mysterious than the Gods - nurturing and frightening at the same time.Ms. Jackson, through the device of framing the story through the experience of a disturbed female protagonist, has succeeded in highlighting the seething void beneath the surface of the polished civil society. Towards the end, the mask slips away totally (as in her story The Lottery) and the primal being shows its ugly teeth. And the resolution, which is a masterpiece, takes us to the realms of poesy where myths and fairy tales are born.Brilliant."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "Such a classic. Even when we know what's going on and why it's happening, it's so easy to fall into the character and root for her. I can't stand the things that people put her through, from the town, to Charles, or even to her own parents. (Although to be sure, we only get a tiny little glance at her parents from a few repeated lines.)When reading this I was thinking of Paul Tremblay's Head Full of Ghosts for the murder (some say accident) of most of the family at dinner, but of course, this was the spiritual mother of that tale. All the little hints and reveals weren't precisely news, of course, but the real treat was in the psychological nuance. Like The Haunting of Hill House, it's not the outright horror scenes that make the book shine, but the way the characters are unstable, what it means, and how it drives the details and the horror of the final scenes. For anyone in love with psychology, Shirley Jackson is a treasure trove of discussable characters. Hell, Shirley Jackson herself suffered from quite a few of them, herself, and brought the feels to the page in a way that few others could dream.The townsfolk were walking nightmares, all color drained out of them. Paranoid delusions or not, I was always rooting on Merricat. Did I get very disturbed by her imaginings? Not really. People can be real *hits. Was I disturbed by her reciting of poisons or the magical incantations she made up in order to protect her house? Not at all. Again, I like weird people and she was, despite what we figure out on a careful first read, mostly just dancing to her own drum. She grew up strange and was always told she could do no wrong. After the deaths, who wouldn't get a lot stranger when every single person in the town believed you did it? Even if she hadn't, it'd drive most people insane.Shirley Jackson is a master at turning normal people into monsters, and this book is no different.I know a ton of modern horror writers who give this author major props and I have to say, it's all very well deserved. :) Bravo!Now if only we as a people hadn't driven this author into agoraphobia, seclusion, and persecution... until she died, alone, before she had even turned fifty.

Sounds awful, doesn't it? But please don't flee. I'll explain.What I mean to say is that We Have Always Lived in the Castle is one of those books that make me think, What's wrong with the people who didn't adore it to pieces? And if you know me just a little bit, you know that I've never said such a thing or anything similar to anyone, ever, and that I never will because that's just the way I am, it's not even an effort for me to live by such a simple civil rule. My standard answer to people who leave a comment under my negative reviews saying they'll probably erase the book from they TBR lists is to go and give it a try nonetheless, that we all have, thank God, different tastes, and that what I don't like is not what they won't like, and vice versa, and I don't say that because, sensibly, it's the right thing to say; I am sincerely convinced of that. I think tastes are sacred, and I also think that who criticizes those is a hopeless fool.But the Castle made me wonder. And I'm a little afraid of that.Like all excellent writers, Shirley Jackson boasts a delicacy in her touch, a carefulness in the way she approaches her characters and their personal stories, their intimate, little big dramas, which I can only describe as indescribable. Otherworldly, maybe. Surely unfathomable. Have you ever been acquainted with Ray Bradbury? Fahrenheit 451? In that book, you will find a justly famous line that reads, \u201cThe good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.\u201d When I first laid eyes on these words, I was struck by the deep truth of these simple words, and every book I read only serves to confirm them. It's all about the approach, you see, about what angle you choose to sneak up on life and capture it. This is why, in my head, I sometimes think of good literature as an exercise in deerstalking. Not very poetical, I agree, but to me, oddly accurate.\u201cI wondered why we would feel different if we saw who sent Uncle Julian flowers. Certainly Uncle Julian buried in flowers, swarmed over by flowers, would not resemble the Uncle Julian we had seen every day. Perhaps masses of flowers would warm Uncle Julian dead; I tried to think of Uncle Julian dead and could only remember him asleep. I thought of the Clarkes and the Carringtons and the Wrights pouring armfuls of flowers down onto poor old Uncle Julian, helplessly dead.\u201dThis passage is the best example of what I'm trying to explain that I could find \u2013the best only because it shows it as practically as possible. The narrator is mourning a death, but somewhat sideways; she points the finger at the villagers' malice, if you read between the lines; and she regrets the past, with a little imagination. The secret is precisely that none of these things are done boldly, loudly or pretentiously. Everything is told from a perspective whose main feature is its disdain for shortcuts and direct routes.It is difficult to tell what the Castle is about. Good and evil? Yes, and not only. Fairytale and reality? Yes, and not only. Childhood and maturity? Yes, and not only. Food and poison? Yes, and not only. The key words, in all four instances, being \u201cand not only.\u201d There isn't a dichotomy capable of exhausting all the directions in which this novel expand, all the paths it dares to walk. But why deluding myself? There isn't any sequence of words, no matter how long, able to do that, and I am clearly wasting my time, so I think I'll stop here. But if I've convinced even one of you to enter this Castle, even in the distant future and not as a priority, I'd love if you'd let me know.

A memorable tale of gothic suspense by Jackson, the author of the much anthologized, exquisitely perverse short story, \u201cThe Lottery\" (1948). Castle is Jackson\u2019s last book, often described as her masterpiece, featuring two of the best characters in American literature, maybe especially Mary Katherine, or Merricat, who says things like this: \u201cOn the moon we wore feathers in our hair, and rubies on our hands. On the moon we had gold spoons.\u201d And, to her sister, Constance:\u201cOh Constance, we are so happy.\u201dWho replies and often says, \"Silly, silly Merricat.\"But she also says things like this, about the people of the town:\u201cI'm going to put death in all their food and watch them die.\u201dSix years ago, several of the Blackwood family were poisoned, from arsenic sprinkled with sugar on a bowl of blackberries. Constance, who was in the kitchen, was and still is widely suspected of the crime, of which Merricat simply says:\u201cFate intervened.

Some of us took very little sugar.\u201dMerricat's distinctive narrator\u2019s voice joins those of Scout and Holden Caufield as unforgettable young people in American literature. At turns creepy, delightful, dark, with a touch of black humor, the book features Constance, the caretaker sister, weirdly hilarious Uncle Julian, and greedy Cousin Charles who comes to live in the castle for a time. I was intrigued by the tension between the town and the Blackwood family holed up in their dark gothic mansion. I loved the chilling moment of the Big Reveal, that dramatic climax, but I also loved the strangely sweet conclusion, colored as always by Merricat\u2019s strange witchy habits: \u201cAll our land was enriched with my treasures buried in it, thickly inhabited just below the surface with my marbles and my teeth and my colored stones, all perhaps turned to jewels by now, held together under the ground in a powerful taut web which never loosened, but held fast to guard us.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Ilenia Zodiaco", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18922532-ilenia-zodiaco", "userReview": "Perch\u00e9 nessuno si \u00e8 preso la briga di parlarmi prima di Shirley Jackson?

I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all, I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else in our family is dead.This is the brilliant opening of We Have Always Lived in the Castle, Shirley Jackson's last novel - published in 1962, three years before her death. It is narrated in the first person by Mary Katherine \"Merricat\" Blackwood, who in a series of flashbacks tells the story of herself, her older sister Constance, their uncle Julian, and the Blackwood family. Together with Merricat's cat Jordan, the three live in the secluded Blackwood mansion. Merricat is the only who ever ventures to the outside world, grudgingly, to buy groceries and borrow books from the local library - uncle Julian is an invalid and never leaves the mansion, and Constance suffers from agoraphobia (as did Jackson herself at the time of writing the novel) and does not leave the estate, never going past her garden. As the novel progresses it becomes obvious that Constance's fear of the town and the outsiders is not completely unreasonable - the townspeople are very wary of the Blackwoods; rumors about the sisters circulate, with Constance being accused of poisoning her whole family, and getting away with murder. The sisters and their uncle are effectively ostracized, and as Merricat journeys to purchase her groceries she is taunted by the local children, who sing a malicious nursery rhyme:Merricat, said Connie, would you like a cup of tea?Oh no, said Merricat, you\u2019ll poison me.Merricat, said Connie, would you like to go to sleep?Down in the boneyard ten feet deep!In his introduction Jonathan Lethem states that the town of the novel can be recognizes as a fictionalized version of the small town of North Bennington in Vermont - where Jackson and her husband encountered both anti-semitismand anti-intellectualism, and where she died at the age of 48. Life in Vermont, her own neuroses and psychosomatic ilnesses, provided her with more than enough inspiration to write a novel which is almost a textbook example of the American Gothic - it resembles the classic novels such as The House of the Seven Gables by utilizing the hallmarks of the genre: a grand American estate slowly rotting away, a family ruined and disgraced by an Awful Event. The theme of entrapment of the hero in a Gothic House is present - Constance is trapped in the Blackwood house like Emily in the castle of Udolpho in The Mysteries of Udolpho, and Jonathan Harker in the castle of the Count in Dracula. in Obviously there's a Villain figure, the male intruder who disturbs the peaceful life of the Blackwood women and their uncle - played here by the greedy cousin Charles, who has an eye out for the Blackwood's money (amount of which is rumored to be huge - how else would three people could keep on living for years without bothering to work?). As in most gothic novels, there's a suggestion of the supernatural. However unlike most gothics, We Have Always Lived in the Castle is elegantly brief, paying attention to not tire its readers and keep their attention, and does so with its succesful use of the first person. Merricat Blackwood is a delightful narrator although she does not seem to think of herself as of a witch, she nonetheless practices a form of witchcraft by burying various objects all around the Blackwood land, believing in their power of protection. She is home to a collection of neuroses and phobias: she dislikes washing herself and instead of cleaning the house she prefers to \"neaten\" it. She is completely unaware of her own filthiness and sees the townspeople as dirty, and the town as an ugly place. She thinks that her left eye works better than the right one, and wants to live on the moon; she wishes her thoughts could turn into reality and keeps wishing strongly for things to happen to people. Because of Merricat's character and the fact that she is both the main protagonist and the narrator, the novel contains a fair amount of black humor and dramatic irony - most of which will only be understandable in retrospection, as the reader will posess the full knowledge of the story - or at least as full as Merricat will allow it to be.Although Shirley Jackson is mostly associated with being a pioneer of horror fiction and many contemporary authors list her as an important influence, this novel is more of a dark comedy about two neurotic women and their incapacitated uncle, chronicling their descent into the grotesque until it reaches its absurd conclusion. It is elegantly written and a great field for interpretation and discussion, yet I felt that it lacked the impact it should have had - unlike her short story, The Lottery whose conclusion was so effective that it shocked the whole nation (and the world - it was banned in South Africa), and her most famous novel The Haunting of Hill House which is considered to be one of the most important horror novels of the 20th century and was adapted as a brilliant film in 1963. We Have Always Lived in the Castle is a quiet and underplayed novel, darkly amusing, but feels like a minor work, one which is usually spoken about in reference when discussing the author's main works. Still, at such lenght it's a sin to not read it as it's definitely worth being familiar with, and it's quirky characters and black humor are worth the price of admission alone. This classic won't steal more than two afternoons from your time, and can provide a fertile ground for discussion along with plain, old-fashioned enjoyment from reading. The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle are the only two of Shirley Jackson's novels to remain in print, along with her short stories - reading her work is essential for anyone interested in post-war American fiction. A solitary woman in a field dominated by men, Shirley Jackson left her mark, scared and inspired those whom we read today. We must not let her work be forgotten."}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "Merricat (Mary Katherine) and her older sister Constance live with their disabled uncle Julian in a rambling old house that used to house many more family members.

This writing shows how these urges, for these characters, gradually form a tightening garotte enclosing their lives, drawing them into an increasingly restricted tiny world of denial."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "Re-reading soon for the  HA Group Listen. Come and join us!I listened to this classic Shirley Jackson story in its unabridged audiobook format and the narrator did a terrific job bringing the story of Merricat and the remaining members of her family to life, her voice drips with atmosphere of the gothic drama. If you\u2019re an audiobook fan and appreciate a dread-filled slightly creepy family drama I highly recommend checking this one out. I downloaded my copy from local library via Overdrive.I don\u2019t want to give too much away because this is one of those character driven, slow burning, suspenseful stories that slowly reveals itself and is one you should really experience for yourself without knowing too much about its plot. When the story opens a young lady named Mary Katherine (Merricat) Blackwood is making her way through the village and you instantly know things are off-kilter. She is buying necessities for a sister who will not leave the house and is subjected to taunts, insults and/or fear from nearly all she encounters. She lives a lonely existence with her agoraphobic sister Constance and their ailing Uncle Julian. Merricat spends her time burying things, following her own strict rules to keep safe and helping Constance keep their home spotless. The rest of their family is dead. I\u2019m not telling you how or why it happened (actually I\u2019m still unclear about the why but I think I have it figured out). They are perfectly content and set in their routines despite their seclusion but it all gets screwed up when a greedy male cousin arrives and stirs up no end of trouble for the little family teetering on the edge of sanity. As little details are revealed through Merricat I really felt for her and understood her bouts of angry thoughts aimed at her neighbors, despite the fact that she seems to be quite happy to be the town outcast. She loves her kitty and her sister and they are all she seems to need in her world. The two however are keepers of dark secrets but I still felt for them to the very end.Filled with darkness and dread this isn\u2019t a horror novel but the writing haunted me. It was written way back in 1962 but feels timeless and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Becca", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/820833-becca", "userReview": "Hands down--one of my all-time favorite books. No, it's not a horror or thriller in the contemporary sense, but just like her short story \"The Lottery\" this book exudes the \"horror\" of mass hysteria in its climactic scene. What does it take to make us stop being civilized, even for a moment, and do awful things to other human beings?Yes, the residents of this house are different, especially the true murderer. But do they deserve what happens to them? And is their visitor any less a villain just because his hands are \"clean\" of the tragedy? I think not.The Twilight Zone (both a radio episode and a TV episode) delved a bit into this question when a blackout in a neighborhood convinces folks who live on the same street that their neighbor is an alien invader just because he's different. They are ready to kill him when a person from another block comes over and says the lights are coming back on.How quickly can we become scared? How much influence does it take from others for us to do something in a split second to another human being that is irrevocable? How far will we go when we become zealous in our belief that \"we\" are the only normal people and our way is the only \"right\" way?I am an unapologetic and unabashed fan of Shirley Jackson, but please read the book anyway! ;-)"}, {"userName": "Miranda Reads", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71848701-miranda-reads", "userReview": "What you think you know, you don'tSeveral years ago, someone poisoned the sugar bowl at a family dinner.

Merricat must get rid of him before he discovers who killed the family but with such a stubborn man, at what lengths would she be willing to go?Bizarre and haunting throughout - the writing is beautiful and the story is riveting.Audiobook CommentsRead by Bernadette Dunne - she was absolutely perfect.
