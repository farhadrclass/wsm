It starts at the bottom and stays there. Whitey was once a famous singer whose precious throat gets ripped to shreds after he refuses to let go of his love for Celia, a dancer and gangster's girl. Now he's a down-and-out drunk living on Skid Row for seven years and going nowhere. One night, he decides to actually go somewhere and finds himself on a dark adventure in the Philly \"Hellhole\" neighborhood on one eventful night. You can't help but feel sympathy for Whitey knowing what he's been through and to root for him now that he's finally found a purpose. And although he's prone to rambling, Goodis really knows how to evoke an atmosphere, and knows how to give a voice to characters who are at their lowest point.\"...yesterday could never really be discarded, it was always a part of now. There was just no way to get rid of it. No way to push it aside or throw it into an ash can, or dig a hole and bury it. For all buried memories were nothing more than slow-motion boomerangs, taking their own sweet time to come back.

It's multi layered, has an interesting central character and a deep interlocking plot. Goodis views race riots, alcoholism, murder, police corruption and a deep seeded longing for a better place all through a tainted glass beer bottle. Whitey, a bum amongst bums, is mistaken for a murderer after trying to aide a felled police officer in a dark alleyway. His trip to the station house brings insight into the world around him. Danger and breathing go hand in hand. The world is not a nice place and the boys in blue have a hidden agenda.I was surprised at how complex Goodis made 'Street Of No Return'. Not only did he maintain an interesting plot set in the present but also enveloped the reader in the past - a time when Whitey wasn't a street dweller and his clothes not insect infested. Even more interesting to read is how that past, and a women named Celia impact on the race riots happening around him in the present tense. 'Street Of No Return' is a fast paced crime novel - set primary at night to hold true to the noir theme. The protagonist is a helpless drunk, the good guys are bad, the bad guys are bad and the riots are only the tip of a much larger and deadlier iceberg. The speed at which the story is delivered is not without its filler content with some passages coming across as dialogue heavey and perhaps unwarrented. The only thing that really holds 'Street Of No Return' back is the typical Goodis internal dialogue by which the character has a tendency to over think a situation and analyse every possible move and outcome. Some of this introspection detracted from the story at hand - which is a shame as the plot itself was excellent. That aside, I really enjoyed 'Street Of No Return' and have no hesitation is saying that this will be a future re-read. 4 stars.This review of 'Street Of No Return' is from the Library of America single bound hardcover collection 'David Goodis: Five Noir Novels of the 1940's and 1950's' - http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12..."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed", "userReview": "David Goodis's star is ascending in the noir writers' skies. He had a Library of America volume of his five novels appear this year. Goodis is an ace on several fronts. For instance, I like his breezy dialogue that sounds authentic to my ear. I like his characters, especially the protagonist Whitey in STREET OF NO RETURN. Once a promising golden-throated crooner (did his career remind you of a young Sinatra?), Whitey's life has wrecked, but the Skid Row lush still rises to the occasion to do one more heroic act. I like Goodis's social commentary underpinning the story. Yeah, life sucks a lot more for some us. His secondary characters are unforgettable, especially Bertha and Chop, the pair of muscle goons. The three-hundred-pound Bertha is as hardboiled a \"dame\" as they get in noir. Great stuff.

David Goodis. ****.\tSet in the seedy sections of Philadelphia, including Skid Row, this novel is one that really shows Goodis\u2019s talents as a writer. It is not a murder mystery, per se, but addresses the plight of the poor and race relations at the time. As a native Philadelphian, I can remember the big headlines in the papers in the 1960s (I\u2019d have to look it up to get the exact dates) that announced that Philadelphia was planning to move Skid Row from its then present location along Race Street to one of three possible sites. There was an uproar from each of the potential sites. I kept wondering, \u201cHow can they move Skid Row?\u201d Anyway...we meet Whitey, one of several winos who habituate Skid Row. Turns out that Whitey was really Eugene Lindell, a (fictional) ex-singer who lost his voice through an encounter with some toughs over a woman. While walking out one night, he discovers a severely injured policeman in a back alley. As he is leaving to get to a call box for help, cops arrive and find him and the now dead cop in the alley. The cops add one and one and get three, and Whitey is carted off to jail. He\u2019s not treated very well at the jailhouse because tensions are strained. There\u2019s a race riot going on between the whites and the Puerto Ricans that has stretched the capabilities of the police to contain it and put a stop to it. Whitey manages to escape from the precinct house, and later learns more about this \u201crace\u201d riot and the real force behind it. With what he knows, he becomes a local hero, but now has to face a choice as to what to do with his life. Well written and well plotted, this is one of the best of Goodis\u2019s novels that I have read. This novel is included in the new Library of America issue of \u201cFive Noir Novels of the 19402 & 50s.\u201d Recommended."}, {"userName": "Tosh", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133661-tosh", "userReview": "David Goodis is the 3:00 A.M. poet of the lost and the forgotten - in other words the damned.

Wonderful book."}, {"userName": "Curt Buchmeier", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26579657-curt-buchmeier", "userReview": "This was my first experience with a David Goodis book and, thinking about the story and the style over the last couple of days, it's better than three stars. Goodis does a great job of establishing most of the characters, none were predictable or stereotypical. And, after a so-so start, he does a good job of taking the reader on a wild, if not quite believable, ride over the course of one night in the late-forties, in what were then the rougher parts of Philadelphia(Precinct 37, I think). Our hero, Whitey, doesn't fit what I was expecting for a hero. I use the word hero but, in all honesty, Whitey is the most reluctant hero I've come across since Holden Caulfield. He meets and falls for the femme fatale, Celia, early on. Then he loses her in what has to be one of the most half-hearted attempts in literature to steal the girl. The word lazy comes to mind but, it was less than that. It was like he didn't care; about anything or anyone. Without giving it away, it plays like this. After Celia's boyfriend finds out that Whitey and Celia are more than friends, he meets Whitey one night, even eats dinner with him, all pretty civil and calm, considering. This guy is connected with the syndicate (mafia), or was and wants back in again, or whatever. Anyways, the mob-boyfriend straight up tells Whitey; leave Celia alone or he will mess him up. And he can make that happen, there's no doubt. So what does Whitey do? Whitey dreams up this terrible plan to flee with Celia, just pack what they can carry, meet at the train station at pre-arranged time and place and catch a train somewhere south the very next night.  Well, the boyfriend is still suspicious, he'd just met with him. He's keeping close tabs on Celia. The half-assed plan fails miserably and Whitey is taken for a ride to the country by several people, severely beaten and left for dead. He barely survives and is a shell of the man he once was; messed up bad and permanent. So, over the next several years, he takes to drink, spends all his money, burns all his friends. Classic slide to skid row, life by the drop. He's homeless and pitiful and likely mentally ill. Thing is, I was rooting for the guy, hoping he would do something to 'save' himself, or at least to try. It was frustrating the first third of the book watching this apathetic hero keep giving up every chance he got. Then one night, seven or eight years later, he gets in a tight situation; he's wanted for killing a Cop. He's innocent, of course, but it's not looking good for old Whitey. He ends up on the run from the Police and others. Along the way, he meets up with a wide variety of characters, all in the same night. Goodis' talent is undeniable throughout the last half of the book.  Take these couple lines describing how Whitey, who is sober, feels about himself. He has been beaten, he's hungry, scared and cold, and is trying to move north through the poorer neighborhoods, keeping out of sight using backyards and alleys. He happens to look at a house with the lights on over a backyard fence. And who is standing in the kitchen window but Celia. Our hero is dumbstruck and begins telling himself how there is no way he can reach out or try to talk to her now; his situation is hopeless and he's likely a dead man. \"So now you're getting to see. You're in that same bracket, buddy. You're one of them less-than-nothings who like the taste of being hurt. That makes you lower than the mice and the roaches. At least they try to save their skins, they got a normal outlook. But you, you're just a clown that ain't funny. And that's a sad picture, that's the saddest picture of all.\"On that cheerful quote, I'll wrap it up. I'll recommend it. Goodis was unique, I found plenty of things to like in this book but, I'm betting he had more success in others."}, {"userName": "the gift", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3403278-the-gift", "userReview": "second review: this is the last of five novels of the goodis anthology, here republished by library of America, again i up the rating, for this one seems almost like his particular template- fast, lean, pathetic, poetic. or maybe just the archetype for him, all the usual suspects: sensitive artist type, thin frail blonde, criminals, cops, and then same plot: artist blindsided by love, girl held back by criminals, ruined and debased world vs transcendent purity of love, lost, lost, lost... maybe i was mistaken in calling it 'nihilistic' because, though he loses out, there is tragedy, there are ideals, there is love... but yes, this is a bleak book, this is a vision of the 1950s far not only in era from the comfortable uptown suburbs i grew up in and always already thought the whole world...first review: sad, sad, sad. walk with the destitute, the indigent, the loser locked into a spiral of self-destruction, all- of course- triggered by love of a woman. short, bleak, existential. possibly most nihilistic of the roman noir i have read."}, {"userName": "Eddie Watkins", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1131783-eddie-watkins", "userReview": "A \"better\" written Goodis novel - more care per sentence, more strategic distribution of plot shifts and tensions - and also possibly an attempt at wider appeal by shifting focus from within his characters' haunted psyches to social conditions - race relations, public corruption - of an external world and the characters' positions therein, perhaps attempting to move beyond what I read were his typical readers - men seeking dark, cheap thrills - but as gripped as I was by his usual street-level authenticity and knowing and compassionate rendering of down-and-outs haunted by viral pasts, using his own tortured soul as template, I prefer (at the moment) his cheaper, (even) tawdrier tales written with less care and more dark recklessness and interiority."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764075-andy", "userReview": "Some outrageous business about a Frank Sinatra type crooner who gets his vocal cords mangled, so since he can't sing anymore he becomes a Skid Row lush in Philadelphia (Goodis Town).

It\u2019s weird that the most revered genre writers, at least when it comes to mystery, tend not to have any of the qualities that genre books are supposed to have. Chandler, for instance, couldn\u2019t plot a narrative to save his life and Chester Himes\u2019s stuff similarly has a weird tendency to run out in strange directions. Not that I\u2019d put Goodis in that category, but he does have that interesting quality of a slumming \u2018literary\u2019 writer. His experiences as being basically, a miserably impoverished alcoholic in Los Angeles, shines (glooms?) through the narrative, and the slice of life bits, about drinking shoe polish to get high or whatever, they really work, in a depressing sort off fashion. But the genre bits in this \u2013 the mystery, the action, etc., frankly didn\u2019t interest me in the slightest, and the back story is incoherent, and there\u2019s more of that then there is the good stuff.

Open on River Street, Skid Row, a tenement\u2019s front steps with a circle of bums staring at an empty bottle of booze, wondering where the next one\u2019s gonna come from. The way the book starts you\u2019d never guess that in another few pages, after learning their stories, you get the feeling you could end up like one of them. But the star of this ensemble turns out to be a bum named Whitey, and it\u2019s his story you\u2019re gonna know best of all. And boy, does he have a story. You don\u2019t really learn much of it before Whitey gets up and heads down the road. His bum pals are baffled, see, because Whitey has followed this mystery man into a place called the Hellhole, where no one in their right mind ever wants to go. It\u2019s the underbelly of the city, torn by racially-motivated gang riots and violent crime. But Whitey doesn\u2019t care. The mystery is tied to his story, which comes a little more unraveled bit by intriguing bit so a reader can\u2019t help but hang on. This seemingly meek bum named Whitey with a raspy soft voice ends up on Hellhole street corner on his lonely mission when a bloody cop groans for help from a dark alley. Whitey goes to the dying cops\u2019 aid, but too late. Too late and too bad, because the cop dies in his arms, and just as he does, a squad car pulls up at the end of the alley and puts the spotlight on Whitey. If you think you know where it goes from here, you\u2019d only be partly right.THE STREET OF NO RETURN delivers on a higher level than a lot of crime novels because this book isn\u2019t about a crime, it\u2019s about a man -- not only how he ended up like this, but what he does with it all after he\u2019s there. The story has a lot of great hooks that keep you going in deeper with Whitey until you just can\u2019t put it down. I started reading this book when I was getting my car\u2019s oil changed, and I was pissed off when my car was ready. I took every spare moment that day glued to this book until I\u2019d finally followed it around its last twisty-turn to its bracer conclusion. Perhaps the real zinger here is that this book, and a few other books by Goodis, are available for free online for all e-readers. I\u2019m someone who initially dug in his heels against e-book revolution, but now I\u2019m an e-book addict, mainly because so much great stuff like this is available for free. I don\u2019t condone illegal downloading, but public domain works are free game, and it seems that several of his books are now in the public domain. So, really, if you have an e-reader and are a fan of crime fiction, there\u2019s no reason at all that you shouldn\u2019t be reading David Goodis.Wikipedia gives us a nice glimpse into Goodis\u2019s career. After his first novel saw print in 1939, he wrote a staggering amount of fiction for pulp magazines and even wrote for some old time radio shows like House of Mystery and Superman. In his time, Goodis met with a good deal of success. His books in the 1940s and \u201850s were bestsellers that drew interest from Hollywood, where he later ended up writing scripts for Warner Brothers. At the time of his death, all of his books were out of print, and remained so unti lthe 1980s when those saints of underground crime fiction Black Lizard/Vintage Crime brought some of the titles back. Finally, this year, the Library of America compiled five of his novels into an omnibus edition, cementing his name in the litrary equivalent of Hollywood\u2019s walk of fame. It\u2019s good when stuff like that happens. It gives you a little faith. It even kind of implies that old addage \u201cthe cream rises to the top\u201d might actually be true."}, {"userName": "Stas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/392269-stas", "userReview": "By the third page I realized that I'd seen the Sam Fuller film (with Keith Carradine).

Goodis (1917 -- 1967) was living in his parents' home in Philadelphia when he wrote \"Street of No Return\" which was published as an inexpensive pulp paperback. In his younger years, Goodis had written for Hollywood and his novels have the movies in view. In 1968, Samuel Fuller directed a movie version of \"Street of No Return\" starring Keith Carradine and Valentina Vargas. Edited by Robert Polito, the LOA volume preempts the 1987 edition of Goodis' novel I am reviewing here, which included Polito's valuable and still-accessible introduction.This is a poetical novel of lonely, failed people and outcasts set in a cold late November in the Philadelphia slums of the late 1940s or early 1950s. It it is set in two adjacent neighborhoods along the river: Skid Row, the home to derelicts and alcoholics with no place to go and no prospects and Helltown. The latter community, three blocks from Skid Row, is in a condition of racial ferment, as new residents from Puerto Rico and the earlier residents come to violence and rioting against one another.The book tells the story of Eugene Lindell, 33, a seven-year resident of Skid Row who goes by the name of \"Whitey\" due to his prematurely white hair. Lindell has two companions, Phillips and Bones. As the novel begins, the three men are outdoors on a frigid day and thirsting for alcohol. When Lindell chances to see a man from his past on the street, he follows him to Helltown, beginning the connection of the two communities in Goodis' tale. With the ongoing Helltown riots, Lindell stops in an effort to assist a policeman who has been clubbed to death. The policeman dies in his arms, and two arriving patrolmen arrest Lindell for his murder.As the book develops, the reader learns a great deal about Lindell. He had been a popular singer with a promising future before he fell for a dancer and former prostitute, Celia, the common law wife of Sharkey, a small-time gangster with large ambitions. Sharkey's two thugs, Bertha and Chop, beat Lindell to a pulp, almost destroying his voice while totally destroying his ambition.The book turns on character and atmosphere. Goodis makes the reader feel the poverty and hopelessness of lonely streets and people in Skid Row and Helltown. In a short novel, Goodis develops place through character. Besides Lindell and his two Skid Row companions, Goodis introduces many other failed, isolated individuals who are formulaic in part but sharply and individually etched in the mind. The characters include a police captain and his two lieutenants, Sharkey and his minions, a Puerto Rican gang leader, Gerardo, and his cowed, frightened assistants, and an aged African American man, Jones Jarvey, who understands Lindell and recounts his own story. Jarvey begins:\"Every man has an ax to grind. Whether he knows it or not.... I've been on this earth a long time... I'm eighty-six. That makes me too old to grind the ax. But the Lord knows I did it when I was younger. Did it with all the strength in my body. And don't think I wasn't scared when I did it. So scared I wanted to turn and run and hide in the woods. Much safer that way. Much healthier. Buth there's some things more important to a man than his health.\"The plot of the book is contrived. It turns on coincidence, a lengthy scene of eavesdropping, and an implausible twist to the story of racial tension and rioting in Helltown. \"The Street of No Return\" remains a strong, brutal and sad novel with its rawness, depictions of place and character, and lyricism.I have enjoyed getting to know the novels of David Goodis through the Library of America volume. Writing in a formulaic medium, he captured a world of sadness and isolation in books of a strange beauty and insight.Robin Friedman"}, {"userName": "Daria Dykes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18294376-daria-dykes", "userReview": "If I could, I'd give it 2.5. But I won't round that up to 3.This was an okay noir - the story unfolds over a single night between about midnight and 6 a.m., and describes the adventures of a skid row bum who catches sight of and follows a figure from his past - and gets led into trouble. This is a nice set-up and structure; I like the \"real time\" feel of the whole thing and I liked the gritty feel of the landscape. However, the dialog is very badly written and the protagonist is not clearly developed. His motivations are stated, but they don't sound recognizable in any way. Of course, perhaps I have been spoiled by too many Jim Thompson books with all of their complex internal dynamics.

Not the best, but decent."}, {"userName": "Kylo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/383537-kylo", "userReview": "This isn't Goodis's best but it's still well worth a read for a Goodis fan. Usual combination of his noir ethos, subtle characterization, and post-war's seamy side still works the charm. This one adds some nail-biting scenes, and has an all-in-one-night schtick that adds to the fun of the reading."}, {"userName": "Michael S", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15040923-michael-s", "userReview": "Great stuff. Really enjoy Goodis's noir. More complex than Jim Thompson (pop 1280, killer inside me). This one approached Algren in grittiness and despair. Prose not as good but an enjoyable quick read with nice plot twists."}, {"userName": "Carla", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3872950-carla", "userReview": "This was my favorite of the Goodis novels in the Library of America collection. The blend of politics, crime, doomed (of course) love, and alcoholic despair make this unforgettable, and a true page-turner.
