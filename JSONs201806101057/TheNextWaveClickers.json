This one featured Brian Keene as co-author rather than Mark Williams.While I enjoyed the creature feature aspects of this story, (which I think were actually better than in the original Clickers), I did not enjoy the involvement of politics and religion.When I'm reading what I think of as a B-movie type book, I want action! I want scrappy, brave characters running all over the place, trying to survive! I want bloody, messy kills! All of this can be found in this tale, true, but layering politics and religion over it took away some of the enjoyment for me. I couldn't help but feel that this book was trying to make a statement, and I generally don't like statements in my creature feature reading, other than general environmental ones, which are par for the course in this sub-genre.Overall, this book was fun and even well written, but I didn't enjoy these serious subjects lumped on top of my Clickers and Dark Ones."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Janz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4415785-jonathan-janz", "userReview": "When it comes to sequels, the law of diminishing returns usually applies. In rare cases, however, a follow-up can equal or even surpass the original. And while I enjoyed the first CLICKERS novel, CLICKERS II: THE NEXT WAVE surpassed it in every conceivable way. This is a polished, fast-moving, epic tale featuring several memorable characters and a great deal of suspense. Brian Keene was already one of my favorite writers, so I expected to enjoy the book because he co-wrote it, but I hadn't read much J.F. Gonzalez until I recently began the CLICKERS series. Now I'm a big Gonzalez fan too. What's so cool is how cohesive the novel is despite being written by two people. Clearly, J.F. and Brian had an outstanding working relationship (as well as a strong friendship), and the power of that relationship is exhibited in the humility, respect, and focus each writer demonstrated in the creation of this novel. This is a fun, ferocious read. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Stephen Kozeniewski", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22484998-stephen-kozeniewski", "userReview": "Yowza! What an upgrade! The original CLICKERS was an excellent, intimate little story. You know, boy meets girl, girl gets head swallowed whole by giant lizard monster, pretty standard stuff. CLICKERS II ups the stakes, ups the ante, ups the characters, ups the gore - it takes just about everything to the next level. At first I wasn't sure if this would be the sort of sequel where a whole new cast of characters steps in to replace the original crew, with the exception of maybe a cameo. A lot of movies, B-movies especially (and the CLICKERS series is definitely the prose form of a B-movie series) end up that way. But I turned out to be wrong. The cast was just bigger, but all of the survivors of the original were woven into the fabric of the story, more or less organically. There were a few coincidental meetings that made me roll my eyes, but, you know, suspension of disbelief and all that. And, besides, once the main crew stopped beating their four or five individual paths and came together, the story really started to gel.Taking place in 2006, Keene and Gonzalez present us with a George W. Bush analogue in President Tyler, a religious nut who seems harmless until the shit hits the fan and decisions need to be made. I enjoyed the political satire quite a bit. It could have been handled with a little bit of a defter touch, but in a gonzo horror novel I guess that's not the greatest crime. A little more irritating to me personally was how the military is portrayed. I know, they say doctors shouldn't watch medical dramas, etc., but I reached a point where I couldn't just go with the flow. I was willing to give a pass on a retired O-6 bossing the Secretary of Defense around and some oddball stuff like that, but when people were assigned ranks like \"Chief Lieutenant\" and somebody declared a CNN broadcast to be a mandatory briefing and called a bunch of marines \"soldiers\" I was just shaking my head. Then again, though, this is part of Keene's 13 universe, so maybe CLICKERS II takes place on a level where all of that is perfectly reasonable. Yes. I've chosen to decide to believe that.Aaaaanyway, some little technical details aside (YMMV, of course, and I assume the marine biologists in the crowd will have a whole other perspective) and some editing issues, this is a really killer book. There's some personal, claustrophobic horror, and there's major devastation and even a civil war. This is a gripping, exciting book. Oh, and my chief complaint about the last book, which was that The Dark Ones felt like an afterthought and a distraction, was completely reversed this outing. I thought they were excellently integrated into the whole, and got a chance to not only be a coherent part of the universe but to be genuinely terrifying in their own right. The addition of a Dark One character may have had a little something to do with that.In any case, if you liked the first CLICKERS even a little bit, you'll definitely want to pick up the sequel, and to be honest, if this is where you're jumping into the series, you'll probably be fine, too. Now I'm off to complete the trilogy!"}, {"userName": "Michael Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6409681-michael-hicks", "userReview": "I dove into Clickers II: The Next Wave immediately after finishing the first Clickers novel. I had kind of expected the sequel to be more of the same, but was immediately impressed with how much larger the scope of this sequel is. Clickers II is bigger and better than its predecessor, with the sea-borne threat even more dangerous this time around. Whereas Clickers was a pulpy, small-town creature feature B-movie set to print, Clickers II ups the ante and becomes a full-blown disaster flick.Hurricane Gary is plowing along the Eastern seaboard, dredging up a fresh swarm of giant killer crabs from the ocean. Ten years after the carnage at Philipsport, the USA is taken completely by surprise when the monsters start running rampant. Turns out a massive government cover-up has kept the Clickers a secret, and Rick and Melissa, two of the prior novel's survivors are on the run and hunted by government assassins. Who'd ever have thought these high-level decisions would come back to bite the country in its big ol' backside?Following the untimely death of co-writer Mark Williams, J.F. Gonzalez is joined with Brian Keene this time around, and the two have done a wonderful job of proving just how elastic this crazy premise can be. While the first Clickers was focused on small-town scares, this sucker brings in the might of the American military, a crazed religious nut going bonkers in the White House, and plenty of carnage all up and down the seaboard, from Pennsylvania to Florida and with plenty of stops in between. I know plenty of readers will be bothered by the depiction of the US President as a Christian zealot (cuz, gee, we've never had one of those before...), but I appreciated the honest assessment of our modern-day GOP. President Tyler is the type of science-denying, news media-hating, religious nut who spends most of his time on his knees, offering up thoughts and prayers instead of decisive action when America truly needs it. Although this novel was written in 2006, it's pretty clear the authors had a really good understanding of just how much farther one of the country's two major political parties had to fall, and it's pretty clear things have only gotten worse in the intervening decade. Kudos to the authors for being so prescient, and politically speaking, this book is even more scarily relevant now. All that's missing are the president's Russian handlers!Thankfully, the blood 'n' guts of this sucker is darn enjoyable, too, and there's bucketfuls of both. When the Clickers make their first invasion, storming the beaches of New Jersey, it's wonderfully epic and very well paced. There's not a lot of slowing down, catch your breath moments in this book, and Gonzalez and Keene sustain a breakneck pace all the way through. Clickers II: The Next Wave has all the fun of its predecessor, but greatly improves on the former with better built characters, the sense of a sweeping epic, and much more depth to go alongside the fist-pumping action. If you read and enjoyed the first book, you definitely need to check out part two! As for me? Well, I'll be diving into the depths of Clickers III later this evening."}, {"userName": "Karl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1935255-karl", "userReview": "This book is copy numbered PC of 500 copies."}, {"userName": "Frank Errington", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3553381-frank-errington", "userReview": "Many times sequels don't measure up to the original, sometimes it's best to leave a successful book stand alone. I'm so glad that this is not the case here. Clickers, originally published in 1998, was such a fun read I never expected the follow-up to be as good, but honestly it was even more entertaining than the first installment.This time, JF Gonzalez teamed up with the legendary Brian Keene. A match made in Horror Heaven or would it be more appropriate to say Horror Hell? The two writers compliment one another extremely well, bringing back those crab-lobster-scorpion things known as Clickers and their scaly conterparts, The Dark Ones. The Clickers are bigger and The Dark Ones are smarter. It's a number of years later and amidst another Category 5 Hurricane the action begins and the attack is fast, furious and much broader than before.Colonel Augustus Livingston, retired, is called back to active duty. He was in Phillipsport, Me to lead the clean-up after the original invasion some years ago. I genuinely liked this character, he's fed up with bureaucracy, as many of us are, and gets to speak his mind and take action. Rick Sychek, who also survived the original attack (and has been living under an assumed identity ever since) is also back and brought into the middle of things despite his desire to be as far away from the invasion as possible. The president of the U.S. is key to this story and I won't say more, because I don't want to spoil it for you. But, he's certainly memorable.Clickers II: The Next Wave won't disappoint. It was just plain fun to read. I would certainly recommend you read Clickers first and there at 2 more books in the series. There are no cliff-hangers per se, so far the two stories compliment one another very well.Available in paperback and for the Kindle on Amazon.com."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1448151-chris", "userReview": "Taking place several years after events in the original novel, bestselling authors Brian Keene and JF Gonzalez offer an incredibly intense and suspense- and action-packed sequel.

I will say that first before I begin criticizing it. The only reason why I feel I have to is because, in my opinion, it fell well short of the first clickers novel for several reasons. The first is perhaps my fault. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have dived right into this book after finishing a five star read like Clickers (I). Maybe I was just a little burnt out on giant monster B-movie plots but I don\u2019t think that was it. I think it is the lack of masterful characterization which made the first Clickers novel so enjoyable for me. There were a few scenes that I found completely over the top and not in a good way, like Tim and Rick\u2019s \u201cordeal,\u201d and there didn\u2019t seem to be very many main characters. All of them felt like minor characters about whom I didn\u2019t care in the slightest. My only other complaint is that, like many open-ended horror novels, Clickers (I) was fine that way. I did not feel disappointed. We know at the end of the first novel that there is a good chance it could all happen again but we don\u2019t know for sure. I think of The Mist by King which, unlike the movie, does not provide us with a conclusion at all. Clickers isn\u2019t that open-ended but I do not think it was a good idea to continue the series. The Next Wave was a fun read, hell I gave it four stars because of that, but a lot of the charm was missing. I had much higher expectations for this, especially with Brian Keene in on it, but it let me down a bit. Still, very fun book and I will read Dagon Rising eventually. I am not going to track it down any time soon though."}, {"userName": "Robert Mingee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31956380-robert-mingee", "userReview": "It's sad when a personal agenda is handled in such a way that it overshadows the story, especially a story that could have been such a fun romp, which was definitely the case with this book. The Clickers and friends are back, on a much larger scale this time. There's no covering this one up, as the wave hits the entire east coast, and the action and \"monster\" story elements are great.But the president has his own agenda, and the way that it is presented really comes across as ham-fisted. I started to feel like a political agenda was being rammed down my throat, when all I wanted was to root for the good guys to blow away the monsters. Don't get me wrong, I don't have an issue with fiction tackling political issues, but when the story starts to take a back seat to the preaching, it gets old fast.Also, like many older Delirium hardbacks, this one really needed a closer editorial eye, and that annoys me, personally, and yanks me right out of the story.I love the work of both co-authors, but this one just didn't work as well for me, and it had so much potential to build on the first book, which is a legitimate cult classic, for good reason. I plan to keep reading the series, but I really hope it goes back to the fun B-movie aspects and becomes less heavy-handed in pushing an agenda."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/365191-daniel", "userReview": "A short take:Oversized prehistoric crustaceans maraud coastal cities in the US and kill with abandon.

It works for the most part because we really see how the Clickers could contend against the military and large city type settings. We get a much larger cast this time around, so while Rick Sychek does return, he doesn't get as much as attention as some of the newer characters like Colonel Augustus Livingston. In fact Livingston might be the most developed character in this series so far. We do get a lot of politics and black shadowy espionage in this book, it comes off feeling epic like a Godzilla or world disaster movie. This time we get the inclusion of Brian Keene's Labyrinth mythology, with hints of the Black Lodge and Proper Johnson. The real treat in this story for Brian Keene fans is the inclusion of Tony Genova. Up until now he has only been included in short stories like Marriage Causes Cancer in Rats. (As well as some other minor short stories, like the one featuring Ob from the Rising.)  For me Tony was plenty of reason to be enthralled in this book, but I understand where some other readers wouldn't share my enthusiasm. However Tony is a important character and so is the existence of the Black Lodge, for those who plan on reading the third book you'll discover why. Regardless if you plan on reading all three books, this one is definitely a must read. Seriously excited to see more Tony in Clickers 3!Out of the whole Clickers trilogy the second books falls as my least favorite of the three. (I don't could Clickers vs Zombies as part of the trilogy because it's missing the main cast.)  One of the main reasons for this is that the whole subplot featuring Jennifer Wasco fell flat to me. I would of liked a bigger pay off with her character's story line. Perhaps if her knowledge of invasive species exploited a weakness within the Dark One's physiology, I would of felt like her main character status wasn't wasted. I understand her knowledge of invasive species was important, I just would of liked more accomplished with the character. The other thing that bothered me was the supporting cast felt bloated at times, I would of liked it if they scaled back on the minor characters just a little. Their came a point where I just stopped caring about minor characters in general because I couldn't' remember all of their names. I have read some other reviews where some over sensitive readers where complaining about \"Christianity\" being attacked in this book. I must say that people need to calm the heck down and get off their high horse. First off my parents are both Christians and I never once felt like the authors were out of line. Secondly it's a horror story, this is the genre where no \"religion\", \"sex\", or \"race\" is sacred. You will get fanatics of all types in horror fiction, including villains who are Rednecks, Muslim, Conspiracy Theorist, Satanist, Atheists, and yes even Christian. The amount of religious fanaticism in this book was the equivalent to what we see in Stephen King's The Mist. So if you are going to judge one then you should definitely judge the other. Just saying. In my opinion I have seen all types of religions go crazy, so it wasn't absurd or offensive to see it happen in a horror novel. Also while The President of The United States is evil in this book, I never once found it offensive either. I wouldn't even be addressing this if I hadn't read some of the other reviews on this website. I will say that it was very original to make the President the bad guy for a change. This isn't a America bashing book either, because in my eyes the good old USA pulls through for each other and I couldn't think of anything more patriotic then that. Regardless of how others feel I had fun with this book and I definitely am very grateful to both Brian Keene and J.F. Gonzalez for working together on it. It gets a four out of five stars from me."}, {"userName": "Mike Kazmierczak", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7313104-mike-kazmierczak", "userReview": "Like all good grade B movies, the original CLICKERS novel gets a sequel in the form of CLICKERS II: THE NEXT WAVE. Unlike most sequels though, the story here is just as good as the first one.It is about ten years after the events in the first book. The government has tried covering up the event at Phillipsport. The truth has been left to conspiracy theorist as all the survivors from that day have been killed or are permanently in hiding. With a familiar catalyst, a hurricane strikes the East Coast and brings with it clickers that are bigger, stronger and more vicious than what was seen before.Mixed in with some new characters such as a religiously fanatic President and marine biologist at the right spot are some familiar characters from the first book. And as before, the characters are really the driving force behind the book. There are the typical victims who are going to die but then the others are the ones that keep you cheering to survive or even booing to die.

Where I was expecting another popcorn book, perhaps demonstrating the law of diminishing returns, I was pleased to find the story evolve, with the book ending up a very different beast as a result. Instead of monsters in a small town, here we have a nation under siege, with characters at all levels (from the streets to the corridors of the White House) threatened by the marauding beasts. Rather than small town monster movie, then, this is more disaster flick than anything else. The writing and characterisation, effective enough in the first novel, is more confident here too. Gonzalez is a more experienced writer, and it shows. His co-contributor, Brian Keene, is also on good form, and this type of horror scenario is one he's shown himself skilled at time and again.

Why? Because I wanted to give this book a good review, wanted to say it was a lot of fun and that the monsters were fantastic. Really, I wanted to.Let's start with the good things: the...um...the news articles were interesting in that they told the story of what the clickers and Dark Ones had been up to since the first book ended. Ships going missing, people disappearing while swimming in the ocean, scuba divers never resurfacing - all due to the elusive clickers. I liked the initial chaos when the clickers came on shore and how the humans banded together against them. Many people did smart things that saved their lives, others weren't as lucky. That part was fast paced and I was in the 300's before I knew it.Bad: There was nothing new in the story - it was like the first one only more people died in more cities. The attack might have been on a much larger scale but it was still the same story being told - clickers came on shore, killed people, went back into the water. There was a long build up through several characters about the \"Dark Ones\" coming on shore and how they were far worse than the clickers - but they had very little impact when they did finally make an appearance. That was disappointing.In the original story, the Dark Ones were creatures that came on shore and acted, yes, like creatures. Not so with this book. Suddenly the Dark Ones are highly intelligent, highly motivated, and with a complete set of human emotions. Really? Why? Why did they have to go that route? When you make the Dark Ones human-like, the story is no longer about creatures being driven on shore due to a hurricane but that of an invading army and the U.S.'s response. The Dark Ones could just as easily been any other country coming in to try to take America over. I don't like war stories - I don't find conspiracy theories in the government interesting, I don't like battle scenes.Through the whole book I felt like someone was telling me a story - there was no sense of being in the story or attachment to characters. The only one I even half cared about was the retired colonel who takes the lead in fighting the clickers. Still, part of the story is that he goes into the battle zone area to find a biologist who can verify what the clickers were - why? Why did she need to verify what he had been saying all along? Why was her saying \"yes, they are clickers\" so important that it took several chapters and soldier's lives to get to her. Also there is a man-on-man attempted rape scene that had no place in the story - what was it's purpose? Nothing was gained by it in the least. It does not affect the character in the least nor is it pretty much mentioned again once he gets away.The story seemed thrown together - like two authors wrote their versions and then tried to mesh them together to make the book. I'm afraid it gets a C- from me. I have Clickers 3 but it will go to the very bottom of my \"to read\" list."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11288298-mike", "userReview": "A follow up to the earlier effort by Mr. Gonzalez that find the hero and heroine of the first book set back in the path of Crabmageddon as it washes over most of the eastern seaboard.

Good action, good characters, enough science to make it plausible. I enjoyed it very much. This is an author we lost this last year (2016).

Gonzalez and Mark Williams has become a geunine cult-classic, garnering a legion of fans and single-handedly revitalizing the \"munch-out\" sub-genre. Like Jaws did a decade before, Clickers gave readers another reason not to go in the water. But now, it's not even safe on land.Delirium Books is proud to present Clickers II: The Next Wave. J.F. Gonzalez has teamed with best-selling novelist Brian Keene for a second assault-this time on a national scale. The Clickers are back, wreaking havoc on a United States already demoralized and defenseless thanks to a category five hurricane and a president who rules through religious zealotry. Now, as the death toll climbs into the thousands, two survivors from the original invasion find themselves teamed up with a marine biologist and a mob hitman, and on the run from the Clickers, the Dark Ones, and their own government. And as their enemies close in on all sides, only one thing is certain-if they fail, humanity loses.Clickers II: The Next Wave.This time, the crabs eat you...", "title": "The Next Wave\n      \n          (Clickers #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2188421.The_Next_Wave", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1453688925l/2188421.jpg", "reviews": 38, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6606656.J_F_Gonzalez", "name": "J.F.
