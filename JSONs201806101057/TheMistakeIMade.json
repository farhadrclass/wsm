She's struggling at work, then rushing home to pick right home to up her son, George on time from after school care. Her husband ran up a bunch of debt, ran around on her, and then ran home to his mother. As a result she lost her business and home (and even the family dog) and now her low paying job leaves her with barely enough money to pay the rent.Many of the struggles she was having as a single mother rang true. Her relationship with her son was really sweet, you could feel how she was trying to do right by him. Nine-year-old George also came across very genuine. I loved the way the two of them interacted. Circumstances just kept knocking her closer to the breaking point.Then she comes home to find an eviction notice on her door. She now has just two weeks to figure everything out.Who wouldn't at least consider agreeing to an indecent proposal?I really felt for what Roz was going through. The desperation was clear to see and I found myself trying to figure out what I would do in some of the same situations. Many of the author's descriptions were bang on. The cast of characters was great. Some of the interactions she had while working with her patients were laugh out loud funny.While this is definitely not a typical thriller, it was quite suspenseful and it had me gripped. I had to know what was going to happen next. \"The Mistake I Made\" is a well written, witty, and entertaining novel that I read in just a couple of sittings. I really enjoyed this novel from Paula Daly and I am definitely looking forward to more."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "April...2016 UPDATE.................I just noticed that this book is $1.99 on Kindle today! I LOVED IT!!!!!! Soooooooooooooo much fun!!!!Pala Daly is a 'go-to' author -for pure enjoyment! This was just so darn GREAT!!!Heck --I'd buy it for $1.99.....(beach read --'at least'!!!) .....Original review: \"Because the only reason you want to leave is because you're ashamed of what you've done. And you can't run away from things, George. What happens if you get into trouble at your next school? Then what? We move again? And again? Every time you don't like something, you can't just pack it in and runaway.\" \"Why not?\"\"Because you run out of options, honey. And sooner or later you have to face up to stuff.\" George, (9years old), was not the only person ashamed for what he has done. His mother Roz, (Rosalind Veronica Toovey), too, was ashamed. She didn't want to tell anyone...(sister, parents, etc ), about the extent of the mess she was in financially. As for why & what happened....READ THIS BOOK!Roz is a physiotherapist. \"Given a chance the body will fix itself. Given rest and TLC, It will recover, generate new tissues, even new pathways \". If the body can't repair itself, that is where Roz, (physiotherapist), helps bring the body back into balance. THIS NOVEL IS SO GOOD... I'm sooooo EXCITED to tell EVERYONE to read it!!!!!The symbolism between the job in Roz's life -- and her personal life is interesting to contemplate. Roz makes personal choices ... ( \"The Mistake I Made\"), that \"given a chance may not heal on its own\"...As for how she can bring her life back into balance- well, it's not as easy as seeing a physiotherapist, that's for sure. One mistake leads to another - to another... Until..????? THIS STORY IS A PAGE TURNER... Addicting!!! GREAT GREAT read!!!!ITS BEST TO READ THIS BOOK ... 'NOT' reading too many details... Its a READERS TREAT......like a yummy slice of Godiva chocolate cheesecake! One little teaser...(that's it)... then I've said enough...other than I PROMISE readers will enjoy this book! Then grab you own favorite dessert with this book ... and start reading!!! MUCH more exciting than a passengers on trains!!!For those who are old enough to remember the movie \"Indecent Proposal\"... with Robert Redford and Demi Moore....This story makes that look like a child's sandbox compared to the drama that goes on within these pages!!!You know that feeling.. When you walk out of the movie theater from just having seen a terrific film... and you feel like you just gotta share??? THIS BOOK IS THAT EXPERIENCE!!! ( but, I'm holding back, because I love my reader-friends). This book is delicious ENJOYMENT!Thank you to Grove Atlantic, Netgalley, and Paula Daily!!!Many congrats Paula!!! Wow... I sure loved your book. All the characters are so well developed too. I hope they make a movie from your novel!"}, {"userName": "Miriam Smith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35740838-miriam-smith", "userReview": "I really enjoyed \"The Mistake I Made\" by Paula Daly and found it a brilliant weekend read that didn't require loads of concentration but was entertaining and surprisingly addictive. A slow burner of a story that's intriguing and thought provoking and one that I enjoyed from the very first page.Roz Toovey is in serious financial debt, separated from her unreliable husband Winston, she continues to work as a physiotherapist trying to stay afloat and keep her young son George fed and watered. Except the bailiffs have just been and removed all her furniture. Could there be a way out of the mess she's found herself in? A stranger has a proposition for her. Spend one night with him and he'll pay her enough to bring her back from the edge of ruin. Should she accept and what will be the implications if she does?Until you're in that financial position it's very difficult to judge what Roz finally decided, though I don't know if I'd have allowed things to get quite so out of hand, but who knows? An interesting moral dilemma which opens up for quite a debate.Paul Daly is a fabulous writer that I'm eagerly keen to read again and I'd happily recommend this book as a well written, entertaining and enjoyable read that fulfils the psychological angle very well indeed.Thank you to fellow reader and friend Rachel Hall for sharing her copy of the book. 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "The Mistake I Made is part Indecent Proposal and part Fatal Attraction. It's creative problem solving that turns into regretful mistakes, it's a sexy thought that turns into a disturbing reality, and all-in-all it's pretty good! The Mistake I Made is a psychological suspense/thriller novel written by Paula Daly. It started out pretty slow but once the thriller/suspense element came into play, I quickly felt engaged. There weren't too many components I haven't seen/read before but this novel was still a very enjoyable reading experience for me personally. I'd recommend it for a rainy afternoon. Check it out!My favorite quote:\"Consider the following a public service announcement: I have treated a grand total of two skinny women in my twenty years of practice who have naturally big boobs. I have treated at the last reckoning anyway zero patients over forty-five years of age who don't sag somewhere. Even the desperately thin ones. You get them to turn over and their skin falls away from their bodies in the most remarkable way. Beautifully curved ladies are criss-crossed with Cesarean scars with striations of stretch marks with indentations as if they were still wearing an underwire bra. Body building men have purple keloid scarred acne backs and give off a peculiar smell from steroid use. Elderly, wirey, superfit fell runners often have buldging varicose veins like small bunches of grapes on their calves, and have flaps of surplus skin around their upper arms and rib cages. Voluptious young women can be covered in black hair all the way from their navel to their knees courtesy of the cruel polycystic ovary syndrome. There are botched tattoos, missing toes, missing slabs of muscle, missing breasts. This is the human body. It does not look like it does in the movies, but that doesn't make it any less wondrous, any less perfectly suited to doing everything you ask of it.\"Note: Any errors in spelling/punctuation in the above quote are mine, as I typed this quote as I listened to it via audio."}, {"userName": "Maxine (Booklover Catlady)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22943325-maxine-booklover-catlady", "userReview": "This is Paula Daly's third novel. I had read her book What Kind of Mother Are You and found it a bit of a let down so I'm thrilled to say this book had a lot more going for it in my opinion.Every choice has a consequence...You know the saying you don't know until you walk in someone else's shoes? This book reflects and shares a brilliant story that might have many wondering what they would do.Single mother Roz has a reached breaking-point. After the dissolution of her marriage, Roz\u2019s business has gone under, debts are racking up, the rent is late (again), and she's struggling to provide for her nine-year-old son, who is starting to misbehave in school. Roz is in trouble. Real trouble. When Roz returns home from work one day and finds an eviction notice, she knows that it\u2019s time for action\u2014she has two weeks to find a solution otherwise they will be kicked out of their home. Increasingly desperate, Roz doesn\u2019t know where to turn. Then the perfect opportunity presents itself. At her sister\u2019s fortieth birthday party, Roz meets Scott Elias\u2014wealthy, powerful, and very married. But the impression Roz leaves on him is indelible. He tracks her down and makes Roz an offer to spend the night with him\u2014for money. He wants no-strings-attached intimacy and can guarantee total discretion. Could it be as simple as it sounds? With that kind of cash, Roz could clear her debts and get her life back on track. But as the situation spirals out of her control, Roz is forced to do things she never thought herself capable of. Can she ever set things right again?I really liked this book, the plot is very interesting right from the start and had me thinking which I love. Roz is a great character and very quickly I felt like I knew her very well and her life became very tangible. Author Paula Daly used to be a Physiotherapist just like Roz, the central character. This made for accurate portrayal around Roz's work which I loved.Faced with an opportunity to clear her debts, but at a price? Can Roz become a woman she never thought she was? What would you say if you were in her situation? I loved the way the book takes us on a journey that is both interesting and challenging. As the situation starts to spiral in all directions the element of tension flows through the words, I was keen to read to the end to see the final outcome. It did not let me down. An enjoyable read with some good twists and strong developed characters. I liked the moral challenge this book presents, you might be find you are surprised in how you view the plot and choices that Roz makes.The ending may surprise a few readers also, personally I loved it and could see how many different endings the author could have presented.An easy 4 paw prints from Booklover Catlady for this drama filled psychological novel.For more of my reviews:https://www.facebook.com/BookloverCat...Follow me on Twitter!:https://www.twitter.com/BookloverCatladyI received a copy of this novel to read and review from the publisher via NetGalley, many thanks."}, {"userName": "Rachel Hall", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28372189-rachel-hall", "userReview": "After listening to the audiobook of What Kind of Mother Are You? and reading The Trophy Child, both of which left a memorably strong impression, I was keen for another page-turning read from Paula Daly. With a knack for throwing a cast of credibly flawed characters into a variety of awkward situations, Paula Daly\u2019s witty, compassionate and loquacious style of prose draws the reader in. Effortlessly humorous and genuinely perceptive, reading this author\u2019s novels is like sharing a bottle of wine with your best friend! Whilst the premise of a debt laden single mother being propositioned in the \u201cIndecent Exposure\u201d sense didn\u2019t overly inspire me, after a sluggish but always engaging first half, The Mistake I Made, worked up a head of steam, albeit requiring a huge suspension of disbelief!Roz Toovey is a physiotherapist and single mother caught up in an escalating spiral of debt, the large part of which was not her doing but that of her feckless but lovable ex-husband, Winston, and father to her nine-year-old son, George. Having lost just about everything, from a house to her own practice working self-employed, Roz is renting, very overemployed at a health clinic with a conveyor belt of patients and in debt to the tune of eighteen thousand pounds on jointly held credit cards. With errant Winston unemployed and therefore not paying child support, the whole burden of cash flow issues falls on frazzled Roz. As the crunch looms and slightly pretentious sister Petra makes it clear that she will not forgive Roz turning to their parents once again, her options are running out fast. After picking George up late from after school club, thereby accruing yet another fine, coming home to find the bailiffs have cleared out their home and an eviction notice is waiting, the last thing Roz fancies is an evening of convivial small talk at Petra\u2019s fortieth birthday party. In the thrall of glamorous and wealthy married couple Nadine and Scott Elias, a fawning Petra makes several indiscreet mentions of Roz\u2019s ex, her inability to find a suitable man and her all too precarious finances. Attentive Scott, a Ferrari owning CEO of an electronics firm catches Roz\u2019s eye on several occasions but as a married man and with a raft of her own problems Roz thinks little of the encounter and she has decidedly more important things to think about than the impression she makes on Petra\u2019s cronies. As Monday morning turns however, Roz is taken aback to find herself treating Scott and presented with a proposition.. one night, four thousand pounds and a no-strings agreement to potentially benefit both of them. Undoubtedly a moral dilemma but as the oldest trade of all and with financial renumeration provided it has the potential to be the answer to Roz\u2019s problems. But, can things ever be that simple? In the world of psychological thrillers - not a chance!From this one event things swiftly become more complicated for Roz as she finds herself caught up in a vicious circle and compromised in ways she never previously conceived. When someone else eavesdrops and wants in on her services and a potential romance looms, what began as a simple original agreement takes on a darker significance.. Just after the half way juncture the arrival of DS Joanne Aspinall and DS Ron Quigley from Kendal CID sends Roz\u2019s fears escalating, however working out what they are after when Roz has her fingers in a significant number of pies is decidedly more tricky. Set in and around the clinic where Roz is based, the breathtaking backdrop of Cumbrian villages and Lake Windermere create a real ambience, especially with Roz\u2019s genuine appreciation for her surroundings. I instantly warmed towards Roz who is a disarmingly natural, candid and self-effacing woman with none of the airs and graces of her sister, Petra, and as such it isn\u2019t hard to envisage admirers being drawn to her, despite her readily admitting she is no more than rather ordinary in the looks department. As a parent Roz is placed in a particularly awkward situation when George\u2019s behaviour at school takes a turn for the worse and the irony of her explanations about not simply running away and starting afresh is definitely not lost on her.The depth of Daly\u2019s own knowledge regarding the specifics of Roz\u2019s work as a physiotherapist will certainly capture the readers imagination and furnishes the whole narrative in realistic territory, and the ins and outs of her job and its symbolism in light of the proposition are presented in a typically profound manner. Roz\u2019s narration is filled with perceptive insights on how the assets she uses in her regular work (\u201cbodies were my business\u201d), roughly translates to the same requirements of her new forays into being a \u2018lady of the night\u2019 and she makes a highly convincing job of doing so (selling herself in an albeit more acceptable, but just as damaging way as she pummels solid muscle mass):\u201c... even though I was no longer self-employed, I was very much aware if I didn\u2019t perform \twell as a clinician, if I didn\u2019t give the patients exactly what they expected, I would be \t\t\treplaced. And so I gave my best physical self: performing back-breaking lifting and manoeuvring, bending over for extended periods, my thumbs losing their feeling from the \tunremitting pressure put through them. I gave my best emphatic self.... and I gave my best in merriment and entertainment...\u201dWhilst I do not think this is Paula Daly\u2019s strongest effort with suspense pretty minimal, an increasing unlikely sequence of events in the second half and a mawkish denouement, it is a thought-provoking read with a cast of well-defined secondary characters and a well-meaning and genuinely caring protagonist in Roz Toovey. So, despite this novel descending into the realms of unlikely territory in the later stages it easily holds the attention and in the same manner that we cannot tear our eyes away from car-crash nightmares, Roz\u2019s predicament and ensuing decisions will inevitably see the reader comparing with their own likely behaviour in such circumstances."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18318291-mandy", "userReview": "Probably 3.75 stars.I had read another book by this author so when I saw this book in the library I thought I'd check it out.This is the story of Roz, whose life has basically fallen apart. Her husband has cheated on her, he's left her in a heap of debt, her business has gone to the wall meaning more debt, and as the book begins, Roz and her son come home to find the bailiffs have been and taken away all her furniture. Then she receives an eviction notice. She really does have her back against the wall.Then she meets Scott, a extremely successful man, who gives her a proposition. It means that she can sort her life out, but should she do it?I did enjoy this, but not quite as much as her other book. It was nearly a hundred pages before she finally meets up with Scott, and I just felt there was a little too much history thrown in.

I liked 'Just What Kind of Mother Are You?' and loved 'Keep Your Friends Close' but 'The Mistake I Made' takes her writing to a new level. Paula writes with great wit and warmth and has that knack of creating flawed but loveable characters and telling their tale in a natural, compelling voice with lots of entertaining asides and observations. But despite all this talk of wit and warmth, TMIM is a thriller: a kind of Indecent Proposal set in the Lake District. When debt-ridden Roz is offered a way out of her financial predicament by a friend of her sister's, she sets in motion a chain of events that gets increasingly worse, sending her into a spiral of disaster and panic. It's tense but great fun. I was completely unable to put it down.

Great concept. Roz is a single mother living in the Lake District. She is in horrible debt which leads her to make one cringe worthy decision after another, slowly leading to a cascade of worse and worse consequences. I won't say much more to avoid spoilers, but overall it makes for a good read -- if you enjoy the tension of watching a life gradually unravel before your eyes. Told in the first person, Roz is an engaging narrator -- frank and spunky. What kept this out of the 4 star category for me is that at times it felt like the flow of the story is a bit too random and disjointed -- it wasn't as tight as it could be given the clever concept -- and the end really held no surprises. But still a good quick read.

It has realism, wonderful comic timing and humour, plus a story that is incredibly plausible.Roz is a single parent, living with her son in the Lake District. She works as a Physiotherapist. Roz\u2019s life goes down hill rather quickly, with her son in trouble at school and her finances out of control. She is over-whelmed by debt, about to lose everything. She is offered a chance to get some money quickly, by Scott Elias. Elias\u2019s sexual proposition leads to Roz\u2019s life being turned up side down even further.This is an outstanding read and it deserves to be hugely popular. Roz is so easy to relate to and understand. She is a working mother, flawed but with a good heart.Daly describes Roz\u2019s poverty so accurately and with compassion. The realism of bailiffs and just struggling to survive is all there. And the lovely moral dilemma of \u2018would you sleep with someone for money\u2019 runs through it. It reminded me of the 1990s, when \u2018Indecent Proposition\u2019 came out at the cinema and everybody had an opinion. I think anyone who is in Roz\u2019s position would just go for it!And I have never laughed so much in my life, reading a psychological thriller. Paula Daly has such perfect comic timing and had me in stitches. Roz\u2019s predicament just got so funny, as one thing after another blew up in her face.

Unlike me who would probably have just said hell yes why not, Roz does pay lip service to perhaps turning him down, but ultimately realises she has run out of options. He\u2019s a charming man and initially it seems like easy money. But \u201cno strings\u201d as we know rarely turns out that way, and a cascading series of events ends up threatening Roz\u2019s life in unexpected ways.It is SO addictive, seriously, I did actually read it in one sitting (apart from stopping every now and then to send a tweet) \u2013 so caught up was I in the lives of these characters and so desperate to know how it was all going to pan out. Paula Daly has an excellent eye for intricate character details and foibles, a way of describing their environment that puts you right on the spot and then a terrific inclination to mess with them utterly, giving them more and more hurdles to overcome. Fascinating, funny, a dark undertone, but always grounded in reality, any and all of this could absolutely happen. Hopefully not though. Mainly as I feel sorry for the fish.The Lake District is a beautiful setting and the author brings it to life vividly and with grace \u2013 in a way that makes me really want to go and live there \u2013 oh if only. Although now we are on the 3rd novel I\u2019m fairly sure I would view any and all of my neighbours with a good hint of suspicion, wondering what they were doing behind those closed doors\u2026Old friends return (all the novels are peripherally connected but each has a fully cohesive standalone story), there are twists and turns galore, a really engaging and captivating voice in Roz who you will sympathise with whilst also wanting to metaphorically clip her round the ear on occasion. Add to that an intricately woven narrative that will keep you fully immersed and one of Paula Daly\u2019s trademark quirky and unusual solutions and you have a really really excellent reading experience.Highly Recommended."}, {"userName": "Dana ****Reads Alot****", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063591-dana-reads-alot", "userReview": "Thank you so much Grove Atlantic,Paula Daly for letting me read this fantastic read..

So, despite this novel descending into the realms of unlikely territory in the later stages it easily holds the attention and in the same manner that we cannot tear our eyes away from car-crash nightmares, Roz\u2019s predicament and ensuing decisions will inevitably see the reader comparing with their own likely behaviour in such circumstances."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13060256-elaine", "userReview": "This is a story that fascinated me from the start. Physiotherapist Roz is a single mother to George and times are hard. Her business has failed and she is up to her eyeballs in debt, struggling to keep her head above water from one month\u2019s end to the next. When local millionaire Scott Elias offers her a way to make some extra cash in this Indecent Proposal type storyline, she gives it serious consideration. She has to consider it, as this money could really make a difference, it would get her out of the deep financial hole she is in and if the arrangement between her and Scott is \u201cbusiness only\u201d then surely, nobody is going to get hurt? I was gripped by the whole concept of the book, that of an ordinary woman driven to desperate measures to keep her head above water and provide for her son and as the story got slowly darker and darker, I could not put it down. As the repercussions from the arrangement start to become apparent I was totally hooked waiting to see how it would all end.Roz is a very honest character and the whole story is told from her perspective, warts and all. She is just an ordinary likeable woman, very human and fallible, just like the rest of us and that really made me warm to her. Despite the road she treks in this book and all the mistakes she makes, I just could not help rooting for her and, probably because of how desperate she was at the start of the read, I found I could not condemn her for the actions she took. It would make a fantastic book club read as it is one that is bound to instigate some lively discussions. After all, if you were in that position, would you do it?I started reading the story the night before I was due to come home from holiday and was amazed to find out that it was set not 10 miles away from where I was staying in the Lake District. I could identify so many places and visualise the setting so easily and my family are lucky that I started reading it at the end of the holiday and not the beginning or I am sure that I would have been dragging them round all the places mentioned.This is a really good, gripping read that anybody reading it will be sure to have an opinion about and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

I do think the author might have got a bit overwhelmed at times with so many irons in the fire at once by the time it really got going, and I thought some areas could have been explored in a bit more detail to add to the suspense, whereas others tended to get a bit bogged down and drawn out with too much unecessary detail, making some parts finish abruptly while other parts tended to drag on.I did like the well thought out and complicated plot which showed how easily one bad decision made in desperate and extenuating circumstances can quickly spiral into many associated consequences with potentially calamitous effects.Having said all that, it did keep me interested and I thought it was a very well thought out plot with loads of scope.I will read more from this author. 3.5\u2605sMany thanks to Netgalley and the publishers for my copy to read and review."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9420458-jennifer", "userReview": "Paula Daly's \"The Mistake I Made\" was marketed as a \"thriller\".

If you're familiar with the film,Indecent Proposal with Demi Moore, Woody Harrelson,and Robert Redford ,you will certainly feel after reading the book synopsis that you know how this story is going to be done. What I was completely unaware was the roller coaster ride of emotions that Paula Daly's story was going to invoke. Admittedly ,I know I have preconceived notions about a variety of topics. But I like to approach each book I'm reading with the understanding that occasionally,an author will call upon me to reorganize my thoughts on certain issues. Hence why I try and expose myself to a variety of genres, writing styles, and authors.  Nothing prepared me for how I was going to feel by the end of this book or the sinister bend the storyline would take.  After all, aside from Robert Redford,what would ever lead any woman to ever agree to sleeping with someone for money? Enter our main protagonist, Rosalind Toovey or \"Roz.\" Roz is a hardworking single mom, whose asshat of a husband left her with a stack of bills that she just cannot seem to get ahead of. Although she doesn't feel up to it, Roz attends her sister's 40th birthday party. It's at this party that she first meets Nadine and Scott. A couple that are friends with Petra and her husband Vince. Although a spark ignites between the two, Roz would never fathom sleeping with a married man. After all, this was the cause of her own marital separation. Why then would she ever do this to another woman?  Why indeed? Roz thinks nothing more of it until Scott arrives at her workplace and offers her a shocking proposal. One night together in exchange for a sum of money. Roz, horrified, refuses, but it continues to cross her mind. When Roz receives an eviction notice and her son, George, is accused of stealing, Roz finds herself reconsidering Scott's offer.  Much to my horror, it's at this point I went from the prosecution to becoming Roz's defense lawyer.  Points to Paula Daly!I'll stop my summary of the story there, but suffice it to say that the text grows and the storyline gets darker. I just know that upon completing the reading, I wanted to hash this out with a group of readers. I think what was extremely well done was the impact of Roz's actions and the anger and sadness that is exhibited by the cast of characters. I found myself caught in the middle by the end of the story.

Roz meets Elias, an extremely wealthy man and Elias is extremely interested in Roz. He offers Roz money to spend the night with him. I can remember having a discussion about this with girlfriends once and the question arises, would you sleep with a stranger for money? morally is this an issue for you personally or not?

S C A N D A L O U S!  Top 50 Books of 2015 \"Best Domestic Indecent Proposal Suspense --Cover Love.\" Paula Daly delivers an enthralling domestic psychological suspense page-turner, THE MISTAKE I MADE -- a gripping 5 stars+. Was utterly delighted when I scored an early reading copy- \"Christmas Comes Early,\u201d with a stunning front cover, drawing you into the temptation. Anytime I see the name, \u201cPaula Daly\u201d  my eyes light up, anxiously awaiting her next addictive suspense masterpiece. One of my favorite authors, she delivers creativity, top shelf quality, wit, and intensity. In her third electrifying domestic thriller, Daly takes us into the home of single mother, Roz Toovey. Roz is a hard-working single mom, struggling to keep her professional and home life balanced. She has all sorts of financial issues; a failing business, a mountain of debt, and a no-good cheating ex-husband, Winston\u2014 of little support, or assistance with their nine-year-old son, George. Winston is like a little kid  himself, a grown man with no responsibility, living with his mother, bouncing from one woman to another. Poor George loves his mom and just wants to fit in at school. He knows they need money, and your heart goes out to him, while sympathizing with the mother.Roz,  formerly a self-employed physiotherapist in England\u2019s Lake District. When there was no more money left, she found herself at a chain on clinics, working fifty hours a week, cooped up in an airless cubicle with a production line of patients. Of course, the fruits of her labors go straight into someone else\u2019s pocket and at the mercy of a practice manager, named Wayne. She is always rushing every day to get to the ferry, balancing her clients, with continuous calls from the school--parenting, financial, and work stress has reached its limits. Roz is being evicted, has lost her furniture, her pride, her business, and has borrowed all the money she can from her sister. She is DESPERATE. George has issues at school, and they need money in order for food and survival. She has no clue what she will do. When she attends  her sister\u2019s birthday party, her sister\u2019s best friend and husband is in attendance. Scott Elias is wealthy, powerful, and married. However, the conversation turns to a subject which leads Scott to believe, she is liberal and open-minded. Could Roz be open to being his mistress? He can pay for her services. Appears to be simple. What could go wrong? Scott shows up at her office  the next day and makes a proposition. He wants one night with her. He will pay her. She can get out of debt. No strings. There is NO way she can even consider this. Or can she? Why would someone be interested in her? She does not even date? Could this be a simple business transaction?  Clean and clear-cut? Nothing is as simple as it seems. She does not see herself as sexy or a package any man would want. However, when George gets caught stealing at school, she knows she has to do something.What comes next  is a series of complex events which spirals out of control. How in the heck can this be happening? What has she gotten herself into? How does Wayne (creep) fit into the equation? Blackmail, murder, conspiracy,  illegal activities, fraud, an investigation, a stalker? A devil in disguise? What if her sister finds out about her new little side job? Little does she know, she may put her own son and herself in harm\u2019s way? Loved, loved this psycho-suspense! Would love to see this one played out, on the big screen--can only imagine the cast of characters. As a single mom, sympathize with Roz, as most of us have been there, trying to raise our children, and circumstances making it difficult. Desperate times call for desperate measures.  At what cost? The twists and turns  are heart-pounding with head spinning action. Fans will love the revisit with DC Joanne Aspinall (from previous books). She was the perfect tenacious advocate for Roz, in order to assist her, out of this mess. What really adds to the intensity,  is the insurance guy, Henry with his background and connections--brilliant; keeping you on the edge-of-your seat to see how his character will play into the complicated saga. Loved the ending, which will leave you smiling. Once again, Daly exceeds all expectations with an \u201cIndecent Proposal-like\u201d addictive domestic drama. If you have not read Daly\u2019s previous books, highly recommend.

She is separated from her husband Winston (a waste of space as a husband, but with a certain charm about him) and lives alone with their young son, getting by on a hand to mouth existence. She has a job as a physiotherapist but after paying the bills and the debt that Winston left her with, she cannot meet all her payments and reaches her lowest point when the bailiffs are called in and she faces eviction. When her path crosses with rich and handsome Scott Elias, he makes her a proposition which is so hard to resist. Although Roz struggles with the morality of the situation, his proposition could be the answer to her financial worries \u2013 just once, and she could start to clear some debts and give herself some breathing space. However nothing can be that straightforward and Roz unwittingly finds herself caught up in the consequences. Paula Daly has a talent for taking an ordinary person and placing them in desperate situations where they have to make a decision, for good or bad, quite often without realising what the consequences could be. Sometimes they seem naive or reckless and you want to shake some sense into them but you still have to ask yourself \u2018what would I have done\u2019? Her characters are suitably flawed and realistic - and some are just downright twisted but her stories are written with compassion and humour. I think her wit is her trademark throughout all her novels \u2013 no matter how twisty the story gets, there is always some relief from the tension.This story is again set in the beautiful Lake District, not only is the landscape vividly described but the author\u2019s first-hand knowledge of physiotherapy adds an interesting and authentic element. This was such an addictive and suspenseful story that I sat up until the early hours of the morning to finish it, I just couldn\u2019t put it down.

She lives in the Lake Country - the setting for some of the most beautiful poetry in the English language - & has a wonderful job as a caregiver. She is a physiotherapist, what we Yanks call a physical therapist. I have not only seen @ the hospital the marvellous things PTs do for patients, but I have spent more time as a PT patient than anyone would want to and found them simply wonderful, both as caregivers & people. (Reading this book, you will learn a lot about PT & human anatomy.) She also has a beautiful & lively little boy. Roz\u2019s life should be perfect. Unfortunately no. Thanks to her quite useless estranged husband Winston, Roz is drowning in debt, the bailiffs (I love the American term, the \u2018repo men\u2019) have taken away the furniture & the range, & the landlord has sent an eviction notice. Roz\u2019s professional life isn\u2019t much better. She feels terribly overworked, her supervisor is a wanker, & her clients mostly churls and whingers who respect neither Roz\u2019s professional skills nor proper boundaries. Her son George has been caught stealing @ school. Despite the wonderful setting of Roz\u2019s life, it\u2019s more Dickensian than Wordsworthian.Then one of her clients, Scott, the CEO of an electronics company, a 40 something in good shape (except maybe for tennis elbow) who drives a Ferrari, transgresses professional boundaries in the most appealing possible way. He offers Roz \u00a34000 (that\u2019s right, four & three noughts) for one night\u2019s sex, cash, no strings, no commitments, nothing weird. If you were Roz, what would you do? Personally I thought she was just a trifle on the sleazy side. (She has family & friends, she lives in a modern welfare state with social services, she & her son are not going to starve or freeze to death, whatever happens.) But I have a lot of sympathy for her. Even those with better moral & spiritual values often crack under extreme stress - & Roz is very stressed.As we might expect in a novel of psychological suspense, the simple arrangement soon becomes a lot more complicated. Scott\u2019s wife & Roz\u2019s sister are big buddies, chemistry develops between Roz & Scott\u2019s brother-in-law, Roz\u2019s odious boss starts taking an interest in her as well & then goes missing, & a couple of police detectives are soon asking Roz questions. Scott starts behaving strangely. Roz discovers there are much more threatening things to worry about than debt.I liked this book better than What Kind of Mother Are You & despite her poor choices & shoddy materialistic values, Roz was easy to identify with & sounded like someone I\u2019d like to have as my PT if I need one again even though I can\u2019t quite imagine her as a friend. But I had a lot of trouble believing in the main premise. Scott gives Roz lots of reasons why he\u2019d rather spend so much on her favours for one night rather than seeking the services of a professional. Tho\u2019 it\u2019s far far out of my league, I imagine with that sort of money, Scott could enjoy an evening with a lady who had all the moves but none of the mannerisms of a professional & all the manners & class of a duchess. Of course she\u2019d be faking it, but then so was Roz. The Mistake I Made rates a very strong four stars."}, {"userName": "Carol -  Reading Writing and Riesling", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11431921-carol---reading-writing-and-riesling", "userReview": "Perfect!My View:Perfect!

Roz life becomes more difficult which every decision she makes. Sometimes it felt like it was all too much, but at the same time I thought, this story is so abstruse it could really have had happened that way. It shows how every single decision you make can be your biggest mistake. And one lie leads to another.After all, I enjoyed reading it. A bit over the top with all that unbelievable things that happen to Roz, but it was a nice and entertaining read. I liked the setting in the Lake District.

Paula Daly makes it sound so convincing, as if it's something worth taking a risk for. And besides whenever you are about to do something fallacious, what do you do? You look for ways to persuade your conscience as though what you were doing so wrong yet so right, you need this and what could POSSIBLY go anymore wrong? Well, just wait for it.Rosalind Veronica Toovey is a single, recently divorced mother who is forced into financial debts due to her adult yet a kid-like ex-husband. Well, to begin with Roz Toovey is a normal caring mother, who is embarrassed enough about her monetary situation that she refuses it to get help or even mention about the extent of trouble she is in to her immediate family, somehow, negatively impacting George, her son. Being ashamed of is this and quite a few other things, Roz is not unaware of the repercussions that could have been with every step she takes, every lie she speaks and every truth she hides. Believe it or not but she is just like any other contrite mother who would do supposedly anything, if she is so close to eviction and unable to face her child. When you really give it a thought, the characters in this book are so credible, the growth and building of the characters have been handled with utmost transparency and a smooth flow through to the end with the twists slid through in between, harder to just stop at one point. Its not like a huge surprise but comes in bits and pieces and continuing for a while.Its in a first person narration, making the story all the more tenable, the setting is quite realistic, some places you'd even notice the irony as to what Roz tells to her son, she herself fails to follow through realizing it quite later. I would not categorize this as much as a thriller but more suspenseful surely and drama.'This is what the brain does. It looks for a way out rather than face the appalling truth.' I need not say that this is a fact that most of the people are ashamed to acknowledge. 'You always take the easy way out' is so typical Roz Toovey but don't we all? Until she realizes she has more to lose than just her home and dignity with what she faces ahead of her. The good thing about this one is that it doesn't torture you or makes you angry at her decisions but scares you precisely the right amount when you see the outcome making you thankful that it wasn't you in her place.Thanks to Mysteries & Crime Thrillers blogspot for providing a review copy."}], "description": "The Mistake I Made\n is the latest page-turner from one of the England\u2019s most captivating new thriller writers.
