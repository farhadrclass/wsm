Intrepid adventurer, brilliant scholar, prolific author. We shan't see the likes of him again, more's the pity. He traveled extensively in Afghanistan prior to writing this novel. I don't envy him the physical discomfort that must have entailed, but I loved the authenticity it brought to the story. This book is only about 340 pages---a mere novella by Michener standards. It takes place in 1946. Mark Miller is sent on a diplomatic mission to find Ellen Jaspar, an American woman who married an Afghan man and then disappeared. Miller's travels take him to the remotest reaches of Afghanistan's deserts and mountains. He suffers extremes of heat (130 degrees!!) and cold. He witnesses appalling barbarity but also finds great warmth and hospitality, and just barely begins to comprehend the complexity of the Afghan mind and culture. Plot and character development are somewhat sacrificed early in the book in the interest of educating the reader. I thought it was a more than fair trade-off for what I got to learn about Afghan culture, history, and terrain. Deeper into the story Michener drops out of teacher mode and lets the story flow without interruption, so I'd say that's the more exciting portion of the book. But it was ALL fascinating to me.RANDOM FUN STUFF: 1)If you make a camel mad at you, you have to remove all of your clothes and leave them in a pile so the camel can \"fight your clothes.\" The camel will stomp on them, gum them, and toss them around as a substitute for fighting with you, and then she will forgive you and become cooperative again. 2)Should you ever doubt Michener's sense of humor, here's my one big laugh from the book: \"I wondered how a man ever got an English girl into bed. What did they do with her hockey stick?\""}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5199391-jenna", "userReview": "It is a great book and gives you a feel for Afghanistan. It was written in the 60s about the 40s. And if you replace Taliban for Mullahs and deemphasize the Russian's it could have been written today. Afghanistan truly is a unique place and the book captures that well. For example, early in the book it talks about how the German's came into Afghanistan and built all of these amazing bridges but after a season or two they were destroyed. But the simple Afghan bridges lasted years and years. A long history has destroyed the land and left nothing but mountains and deserts. I have been to many of the places mentioned in the book and it was great to read about the places I haven't been but flown over (desert near the Iranian border) and the Buddha statues (since destroyed by the Taliban). At the end of the book there is a note to the reader about changes in the 17 years from when the book takes place and when it was written. I will tell you - the Afghanistan of 2011 mirrors 1943 more than the 60s. During the 60s and 70s Afghanistan strove towards the west with electricity, \"equality\" for women and such...the 1989-2011 has set it back to previous centuries."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron", "userReview": "Despite--perhaps because of--its age, Michner's view of the then-current affairs and potential futures for Afghanistan make fascinating reading now. Forty-five years ago he recognized the potential of fundamentalist Moslem control of the land, but he voted for the secularists. He was wrong, but it didn't have to be that way.(I never saw the motion picture based on Michner's book and encourage a reader to seek the novel rather than the movie.)For a modern alternative ending to Afghanistan's latest chapter as political football to world powers and religions, read Greg Mortenson's \n  Three Cups of Tea\n."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "This is the first book I read for my 1963 reading list. It was #4 on the bestseller list for that year. At under 500 pages it is short for a Michener book. The location is Afghanistan. The year is 1946. I would bet that the country was not much in the news in the year after WWII ended though it was a time of anxiety about the USSR and the spread of communism. In the story however, the anxiety at the US Embassy in Kabul is over an American young woman who had married an Afghan man she met in college and returned with him to his country.When the story opens, Ellen Jasper's parents back in Pennsylvania have not heard from their daughter in some time and have contacted their senator, asking him to put pressure on the Embassy to investigate her whereabouts and well being.Mark Miller, descendant of Jewish immigrants to the US from Germany in the mid 19th century, is now posted in Kabul as a junior grade State Dept officer. Since he speaks the language the assignment goes to him to find Ellen. Why mention that he is Jewish? It plays into the story in an interesting way.The novel is a wonderful introduction to this country in the days when \"Kabul today shows what Palestine was like at the time of Jesus\" as they were wont to say at the Embassy. In fact, the Mullahs rule the society and Miller is a witness to two incidents of stoning; one of a female adulterer and one of a male homosexual. But there are also young men who wish to bring the country into modern times, both as a society and technologically. Ellen's husband is one of those men.As Miller sets out in pursuit of the missing woman, Michener takes the reader on a journey through the mountains and deserts of that forbidding land. According to his Author's Note, he himself spent time traveling in Afghanistan before writing the book. Plenty of adventure ensues, during which he draws a complete introduction to the lives, issues, and customs of the times. Of course, there is also romance and some pretty racy scenes for a Michener bookI was somewhat amused by Michener's treatment of the Ellen Jasper character. Miller does find her. She is fearless, wild, and in complete disagreement with wars and progress and the American imperialist agenda. She goes through men as if it were the free love era of the 1960s. Michener was no fan of hippies, protesters, or any anti-American sentiments. Indeed he was a complete patriot. So he approaches this character with a combination of psychological interpretation and condescension. However, Mark Miller falls for her and hard. I could see how the book became a bestseller in 1963!"}, {"userName": "Brendan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134752-brendan", "userReview": "At just 336 pages, Caravans is a tight, talky, and wonderfully insightful piece of work set entirely in Afghanistan. The novel centers on Mark Miller, a young American diplomat stationed in 1946 Kabul, who is charged to find Ellen, a woman who married an American-educated Afghan named Nazrullah and then disappeared. He eventually finds her among a group of nomads. Miller\u2019s traveling companion, meanwhile, is Dr. Otto Stiglitz, a Nazi war criminal.More than forty years after the publication of Caravans, we live in a world obsessed with competing moral visions (e.g., torture is necessary when we do it, evil when they do it). But these are hardly new, as Michener suggests over and over. His characters struggle with the barbarity of traditional culture even as they are confronted with the overwhelming force and, yes, barbarity of encroaching modernism. Nazrullah, for instance, makes an impassioned speech suggesting that, for all its faults, at least Afghanistan is no Germany (i.e, we stone women and children but at least we don\u2019t gas them):\"I went to Germany at the age of twenty. Before that I\u2019d been educated by private tutors whose main job, it seems to me now, was to impress me with the moral depravity of Afghanistan and the timeless glory of Europe. I knew no better than to accept their indoctrination at face value and reported to Germany fully prepared to exhibit my tutors\u2019 prejudices. But when I reached G\u00f6ttingen I found that the true barbarians were not the primitives who stone women in Ghazni -- and we have some real primitives in this country -- but the Germans. From 1938 through 1941 I remained as their guest, to witness the dreadful degeneration of a culture which might once have been what my tutors claimed but was now a garish travesty. Believe me, Miller, I learned more in Germany than you\u2019ll ever learn in Afghanistan.\"As you know, I went from Germany to Philadelphia, where half the people thought I was a Negro. What I didn\u2019t learn in Germany, you taught me. Why do you suppose I wear this beard? Before I grew it I made a six-week experiment. I decided to be a Negro . . . lived in Negro hotels, ate in their restaurants, read their papers and dated Negro girls. It was an ugly, ugly life, being a Negro in your country . . . maybe not so bad as being a Jew in Germany, but a lot worse than being an Afghan in Ghazni. To prove to Philadelphians I wasn\u2019t a Negro, I grew this beard and wore a turban, which I had never worn at home.\"But what I love about Michener is that he doesn\u2019t settle for the easy argument. Ellen eventually leaves Nazrullah for the Nazi Stiglitz, who converts to Islam. The Jewish Miller is forced to confront the German, while the Afghan assures him that purity -- racial, moral -- exists only in Hitler\u2019s head. \u201cIf the facts were known,\u201d Nazrullah tells Miller, \u201cprobably half our Afghan heritage is Jewish. For hundreds of years we boasted of being one of the Lost Tribes of Israel. The Hitler decreed us to be Aryans, which gave us certain advantages.\u201dLater Ellen describes her own disillusionment -- with the easy bigotry of Americans during the war years, with \u201ckept professors\u201d whose \u201cmoral responsibility was to dissect the world\u201d but who instead \u201cwere paid to defend it.\u201d Her father, she explains, was one of those men.\u201c'What I mean is, my father described anything out of the ordinary as ridiculous, and I wanted to outrage his whole petty scale of judgment. What was the most ridiculous thing I could do? Run off with an Afghan who had a turban and another wife.' She laughed a little, then added, 'Do you know what started my disillusionment with Nazrullah? That turban. He wore it in Philadelphia for show. He\u2019d never think of wearing it in Kabul.'\u201dOf course, Ellen does top herself when she trades in her manly turban for a mixed-up Nazi. No easy answers, little room for self-righteousness -- this is what I love about Michener."}, {"userName": "Emma Deplores Goodreads Censorship", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship", "userReview": "I bought this book after loving Michener's Hawaii, hoping for a similarly wonderful reading experience. I was disappointed. The best I can say is that I learned some things--the book takes you around Afghanistan in the 1940s, introducing a variety of places and cultures and including pertinent historical information--and that's why it gets 2 stars despite being otherwise awful. This book suffers from the twin problems of an uninspired, meandering plot and a narrator who is one of the most unlikeable characters I've encountered in quite a while. First, the plot. The book is marketed as a tale about a diplomat (Mark) searching for an American girl (Ellen) who married an Afghan, then disappeared. But the first 100 pages of the 400-page book are all about everyday diplomatic life in Kabul (there isn't even any conflict to keep readers entertained), and we're past the halfway point before Mark bothers to ask Ellen's husband about her whereabouts--despite the fact that everyone has known the husband's location all along and he has nothing to hide! A plot that serves mostly as an excuse to explore a setting can work, but in a novel, descriptions of the geography and culture can't just replace interesting events and dialogue. For that matter, all of the characters work to avoid plot advancement: before actually sending someone to search for Ellen, or even talk to her husband, the U.S. government interviews all of her former boyfriends and roommates in an attempt to figure out \"what was wrong with her\" that made her marry an Afghan in the first place, and there's much serious discussion of whether Ellen's hometown was objectively a bad place. (If Michener intended to poke fun at the investigation this might have been clever, but unfortunately he seems 100% serious, providing some unintentional comedy.) If missing-persons investigations are conducted this way in real life, I'm surprised anyone is ever found. Then there's Mark. He's a jerk. For instance, he theorizes that Ellen chose her unusual lifestyle because she can't have kids, resulting in--wait for it--\"a barrenness of spirit.\" I haven't even gotten to his creepy relationship with the Nazi refugee Stiglitz, a prime example of character relationships that make no sense. Mark is Jewish (and prides himself on having \"table manners\" despite that fact, as if Judaism and etiquette were mutually exclusive), and he veers back and forth between wanting Stiglitz dead for the atrocities he committed and wanting to be his friend. I can't imagine why, since Stiglitz--like Mark and most of the other characters--is utterly unappealing and unsympathetic. Oh, and it's worth mentioning that Mark has random, plot-irrelevant flings with most of the female characters in the book. Give me a break. Ultimately, this book was a huge letdown. It read like a travelogue--dull, with little plot or conflict and uninteresting characters. It felt incredibly dated (I suppose I should have known that from the plot summary: it is, after all, a book about a white man traveling around an Eastern country, getting \"closer to earth,\" and attempting to \"rescue\" an American woman he has no reason to believe is even in danger). Unfortunately, after Caravans, I will be wary of Michener books in the future. For those who want to learn about Afghanistan through enjoyable fiction, I'd recommend Khaled Hosseini's works instead."}, {"userName": "Ebookwormy1", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1005834-ebookwormy1", "userReview": "Clocking in at just under 340 pages, Caravans lacks both the heft and span typical of the generational saga for which Michener is known. This is not the best of Michener and it\u2019s not my favorite, but I\u2019m glad I read it after all these years.What makes this book especially intriguing is its publication in the year 1963, and setting in the post-World War II Afghanistan of the late 1940s. The main character of the work is the land itself: Afghanistan. Beautiful and complex, Michener presents us with a land full of struggle and drops story into it. We become acquainted with Afghanistan\u2019s aspiration to modern stability, feel the heat of the nation's steep in history, and cheer for it\u2019s precocious steps to maturity. The time in which Michener published this work, the 1960s, were relatively stable and optimistic for Afghanistan, and setting the book 20 years prior allowed Michener to dramatize the people and events bringing about this ambitious adolescence.\u201cWe went into the night and for the first time in my life I saw the stars hanging low over the desert, for the atmosphere above us contained no moisture, no dust, no impediment of any kind. It was probably the cleanest air man knows and it displayed the stars as no other could. Not even at Qala Bist, which stood by the river, had the air been so pure. The stars seemed enormous, but what surprised me most was the fact that they dropped right to the horizon, so that to the east some rose out of dunes while to the west other crept beneath piles of shale.\u201d pg. 172 Caravans, Michener, 1963.Afghans are portrayed as ambitious, clever people shaped by their history and geography, who are accustomed to surviving in conflict with the environment, each other, and external powers \u2013 from Alexander the Great, through various conquests from India and the terror of Genghis Khan, to the Russians, English and Americans in the 1940s. It is the emergence of Russian and American power that rocked Afghanistan from the 1970s through the 2010s, but while Michener anticipates it\u2019s coming, he had no knowledge of those events at the time story was written. This gives a glimpse of Afghanistan BEFORE the modern age, BEFORE the encroachment of modern powers, BEFORE penetration of the state to remote areas, BEFORE the height of the Cold War that drew Russia and the USA into contention, BEFORE globalization brought America closer to Asia.\u201c\u2019I claimed that originally Afghanistan knew the freedom of the caravan, but that willfully the people put themselves in these village prisons under the rule of the mullahs\u2026. Miller claimed that we can never go back to the caravan. That we will know freedom only when the villages have books and roads and electricity.\u2019 \u2018Your right about the past\u2026 He\u2019s right about the future\u2026 Some day all of us will live in villages like this. But they will be better villages.\u2019 And he was gone.\u201d pg. 244-245 Caravans, Michener, 1963.The most distasteful characters are Westerners, which shields the narrative from contemporary claims of obtrusion. Bound to their countries of origin by birth and culture, seeking adventure, experience, and/ or refuge in an exotified remote locale, the Westerners are promiscuous people focused on personal or political objectives and willing to use Afghanistan and it\u2019s people to further their own ends. Through them, we see the messiness of the struggle: people engaged in using others often discover the others are also playing them \u2013 and in this case, the Afghans have the home field advantage. Added into the mix are various themes illustrating the palate of Afghan topography. Political complexity is illustrated as Afghans, mullahs, urban educated, rural nomads, the Americans, Russians and English compete for advantage. Religious complexity is painted through Jewish, Christian (Catholic, Protestant), and Muslim beliefs/ historical claims and is magnified by the post-Hitler era in which the story takes place. Social complexity emerges between wandering nomads and the toe hold of civilization represented by Afghan governmental employees, between citizens of international education/ language/ experience and under resourced locals, between lawfulness of cities and pragmatism of remote settlements the state literally cannot reach, and between mullahs seeking to enforce a conservative Islam and worshippers engaging in a syncretistic survivalism. All of this complexity is brushed over with a romanticized stroke that makes the book more fictional travelogue and less social commentary, while taking us back to Michener\u2019s time when the country of Afghanistan, it\u2019s history and people, were not well known outside of Asia. A map in the fore leaf helps us to follow along on the journey, and brief but insightful notes clarify the line between imagination and history in a typical Michener touch.Now that I have his perspective, I\u2019m ready for other titles.

This was a lovely read, and a short one relatively to his fat books. A single story here, unlike in his most other books.

LoVeLy!!\n  \u201cAfghanistan, one of the most inconspicuous nations on earth. In 1946 it was just emerging from the bronze age, a land incredibly old, incredibly tied to an ancient past. At the embassy we used to say, \u201cKabul today shows what Palestine was like at the time of Jesus.\u201d\nHe also writes about the ill-treatment of women in the country who have been responsible for adultery, which was terrifying yet has been (and still is) the truth. Also a lot is written about the life of caravans and the people involved in it and their perceptions and opinions of life's essences. And much, much more !The book also expresses ideas and opinions using opposing characters, about the 'unspoiled' and 'civilized' world of Afghanistan Vs the so-called 'civilized world of the West' and how we are destroying ourselves.Considering it is a smaller book than the author's other counterparts, this is a good book to start off with for those who wish to try James Michener's works.Certainly recommended !! :)"}, {"userName": "Don Fannin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19843571-don-fannin", "userReview": "I first read this book in college 65 to 69. And I am rereading it now. I almost never read a book. But as the US got involved in Afghanistan it framed the way I thought about the country. As with all of Michener's good novels this is a story, a travelogue, social and political commentary, and history. To be honest the story is weak. It is good enough to keep you reading but not enthralling by any means. The travelogue is magnificent. Word pictures of a dusty dirty part of the world, primitive where a pack of wolves roam the streets of Kabul, hot dry deserts so dry that they suck the moisture from you and if you are in it for a couple of days with no relief it will mummify your body, the high green valleys of the Hindu Kush. I think his understanding of the political environment was almost prescient, he commented on the Ultra-conservative Mullahs challenging the government, almost predicted the Russian incursion. But showed the country to be a collection of tribes and area that were not under the rule of the government in Kabul. The history is mostly passing references to Alexander, the Mongols, Tamerlane, the British.

Including this one on Afghanistan. The book is, of course, outdated. It was published in 1962. But there is still a reason to read it. I think it reads well paired with Jason Elliot's An Unexpected Light -- the best travel book I have read, the best book on Afghanistan I have read, and the best book on Western desire I have read. Michener is writing after WWII, when the pull of the Cold War is greatest and most silent. His treatment of Afghanistan is really a statement of Western desire for Afghanistan. Compare that to Elliot's travel book. He risks life and limb as a twenty something to walk through Afghanistan -- during the heat of its post-soviet exit. The question of course is: Why risk it? We learn something about Western desire from Elliot.

An American embassy worker in Kabul, 1946 goes searching for a missing American girl who has run off with a Afghani. The book is vaguely interesting for its descriptions of an Afghanistan mostly untouched by Western influences, but little else. You're not going to remember any of the characters. There is exactly one gripping scene, when the protagonist witnesses a adulterous woman stoned to death by a mob in Kandahar. Also, the book has a fairly nuanced treatment of the Islamic mullahs, who are portrayed as the progressive element in Afghan culture - very unlike most modern depictions of the Taliban.It is funny to think Michener was considered shockingly liberal by the standards of the 1950s. His books are completely retrograde by today's standards (ask my wife about how Michener treats his female characters). Literary qualities aside, Michener's novels (particularly the early ones) serve as a very interesting signpost in the development of Western thought over the past seventy-five years. This was what liberal, middlebrow literary culture looked like prior to the great cultural revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s. His books are totally free of the identity politics that dominates the cultural conversation today, for instance (he has \"Caravans\"' protagonist refer to certain practices in Afghan culture as \"disgusting sodomy\" without blinking - try finding a modern New York Times bestseller that does that!) Moving on, one of the most interesting books Michener wrote was \"The Drifters\", which is about the emerging hippie and anti-war subculture in 1968 America and Europe. It's not a great book, but it is rather unique as a picture of the 1960s youth culture from the perspective of someone we would now call a member of the WASP Establishment (Michener was born in 1907, so was sixty-one at the time he wrote The Drifters). Although Michener was never a great writer, he was a pretty fair one, and attempted to record objectively what he saw as the new cultural consensus emerging from the death of the Establishment in 1960s America.Post-Boomer generations in the West have grown up with that consensus, first expressed by the 1960s youth culture and then the subsequent rights movements - sexual liberation, feminism, gay rights, etc. Almost all literature produced since then either takes these ideas and assumptions for granted (or attacks them without quarter). For intelligent members of the Millennial generation, who have grown up in a world of rape culture, Whiteness Studies departments in universities, and Presidential proclamations celebrating GLBT Pride Month, reading Michener's books can help us realize that once upon a time, not so long ago, such cultural events would have been considered not just wrong, but totally unthinkable. Reading Michener's books, among others, can help us critically look at our own unquestioned assumptions about how the world should work.That's a lot to take out of middlebrow novels like \"Caravans\", but since the plot and characterization is so thin, you might as well focus on their place in recent history rather than their actual literary quality."}, {"userName": "Katherine Gypson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1438088-katherine-gypson", "userReview": "Caravans, James Michener's 1963 novel about the then-largely unknown country of Afghanistan, is a historical novel in more ways than one. Written sixteen years before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that would spark three decades of war, Caravans takes the reader even farther back than Michener's own time to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul in the days just after the end of World War II.Part of what makes this novel so fascinating is that the reader knows more about Afghan history than Michener did while writing it and Michener knows more than the characters because he has placed a 16-year gap between them and his own time. The layers of history almost spread out before the readers' eyes, lending a poignant depth to the story.Michener traveled extensively in Afghanistan and when asked, often said that it was the country he most wanted to return to. His love for the Afghan people and culture shines through in this book. I wrote my college thesis on Afghanistan, have produced several television series that have aired there and traveled to Kabul last spring. I could not find a single error in Michener's work and loved the way he was able to incorporate so much fascinating history and culture into the novel while still keeping up with the fast-paced plot. I enjoyed the opening chapters in Kabul the most - Michener brilliantly captures the feelings of his main character Mark Miller, a young State Department employee. Miller experiences a mixture of awe, fear, confusion and excitement as he discovers Afghanistan. There are some beautiful moments when Miller pauses and looks out at the mountains surrounding Kabul and feels a sense of timelessness that I remember experiencing during my own time there.But Caravans isn't just a history lesson or a travel essay - it also has an engaging plot set in motion by a young American girl named Ellen Jaspar who meets an Afghan student, falls in love and marries him against her parents' wishes. After returning to Afghanistan, Ellen disappears and it's Miller's job to trek across the deserts and mountains to find her. Ellen is a kind of proto-hippie, rebelling against the structures of modern society. Placing her within the context of Afghan culture makes for some very interesting moral and sociological questions.Michener doesn't entirely overcome the gender bias of his own time - he makes it clear that Ellen is a flighty, manipulative girl while Miller, who seduces a nomad girl and then abandons her with barely a look backwards, is just doing what men do. There are also some disturbing moments early on when Miller seems excited rather than repelled by seeing women in burkas. From a historical perspective, it's interesting to see how people viewed the question of women wearing hijab prior to major US involvement in the region but I was turned off by Miller's obvious \"Oriental\" fantasies.

But one wonders if anyone in \"exceptional\" America read it when Charlie Wilson went to arm the Taliban against the Soviet supported regime, when soldiers were sent after 9/11 only to remain there for a dozen years. The author described Kabul as resembling Palestine in Jesus' day, of death by stoning, of an eye for an eye and a life for a life, of the fate of the country to be determined when Afghanistan was left to itself, by the struggle between the many bearded men led by mullahs from the hills and the few young experts with degrees from Oxford, Sorbonne or MIT, the former making up 99 percent of the country. \"We are a brigand society and we murder our rulers,\" says one of the characters. There are striking descriptions of a violent and very different society that has very likely not changed much except that the munitions have multiplied, the mullahs reinforced with money and ideology from an even more fundamentalist source, and the young experts very likely all corrupted or disenchanted. It is a quiet book and does not address itself to the political issues. But, did anyone within the Beltway, ANYONE, read it?"}, {"userName": "Christine Lynch", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2711240-christine-lynch", "userReview": "This is the second Michener book that I've read and the only thing stopping me from racing ahead with more is the daunting length of nearly all of his other book. Caravans was a nice, short 13 hours on audible. The story itself was very straightforward.A young Jewish American named Mark Miller, working in diplomatic relations at the US Embassy in Kabul in the late 1940s finds himself assigned the Ellen Jasper case - an American girl, from a connected family in small-town Pennsylvania, runs away from college to Afghanistan to marry her boyfriend Nazrullah. She now, not having written to her parents in 13 months, has been reported missing. As Miller journeys through Afghanistan in search of, and eventually with, Ellen he comes to a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances of contemporary Afghan life. -how to survive desert travel (heat, lack of water, sand storms)-how to maintain good relationships with the camels -the trials and tribulations of dating an Afghani girl-the stealing, reselling & sharing economy-life as a Kochi (nomad)Quote\"You cannot find peace in old conventions and beliefs.

For readers who enjoy a well researched, well written historical fiction with well developed characters, Michener is a good choice. This one is set in Afghanistan immediately following WWII when the US and Russia are both vying to elevate their influence in this country where life is still very much as has been for centuries without change.First published in 1963, this book offers insight into this culture, their history, their ways of living and thinking, the kinds of people who live there, why and how they survive in a very harsh climate and how those who try to modernize and change it really have an uphill climb against the many who want it to remain pretty much the same as it has for so long.I was really engaged with this story as it gave me at least a little more understanding of what has happened in this area more recently.

That might seem odd, but it was interesting to read about Afghanistan (even if fictionalized) in the late 40s from a writer in the early 60s.

For today's standards, these practices are hardly shocking or revealing. The protagonist's Western condescension, apart from the narrator finding the notion of homosexuality revolting, is what surprised me. The novel, published in 1963 and takes place in 1946, comes well before the West\u2019s post-9/11 fascination with Islam. Nevertheless, Michener's description of the chaderi as \"sexy\" echoes what many modern feminists, entrenched in multiculturalism, say about head scarves and burqas. It's that very post-modern \"progressiveness\" that made me dislike the novel so much.The singular frayed thread to hold the story together \u2013 the disappearance of an American woman who discarded her \u201cbourgeois\u201d suburban upbringing to marry a wealthy Afghani man and enter into his harem \u2013 failed to pull me into the novel. Her backstory, if anything, turned me off further. Several times I wanted to chuck the book across the room for all the obnoxious stereotyping and cultural relativism. (Again, Michener expresses contemporary \"progressive\" thought when he suggests that Nazi Germany wasn't all that much different from suburban America.)The narrator\u2019s American and Jewish roots should have provided more interest, especially in the midst of the Middle East and the Holocaust going on in Europe, but Michener brushes over what might have been the novel\u2019s most fascinating feature. I persevered until the end, unconcerned for any of the characters. The prose is adequate, and I can find no fault with the grammar or writing style, although at times it was rather bland. If you enjoy superficial exposes of foreign nations without any characters to care for, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, I\u2019d advise to avoid."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1094650-pamela", "userReview": "Even though I think this book could be diagnosed with multiple personality disorder, I give it 4 stars. The main character is Afghanistan and composes the first personality: vibrantly rendered, interesting, eye-opening. This is the kind of book you want to read with Google at your fingertips, as I really liked seeing the places Michener wrote about. Some were fictional, some were not, but he explains this in his afterword. Even just seeing images of Afghanistan was enough to enhance my experience of the book.The other personality really brings the book down, and that is all the other characters. Well, not all. Just the two Americans and the German. I am really not sure what the point was and the plot meandered quite a bit. The relationship between Mark, the Jewish narrator, and Stieglitz, the escaped Nazi, was necessarily complicated, but it wasn't as well nuanced as it might have been. I think Michener explained too much and made it way too pointed. And Ellen . . . I have always had a problem with affluential, disaffected characters. They do not appeal to me in the least. And this is Ellen in a nutshell. I would like to slap her and tell her if she is unhappy with her middle-class American life, then DO SOMETHING, for God's sake, instead of toying with people and risking lives and wreaking havoc with people's emotions. Start a charity. Feed the poor. Clothe the needy. Stop being so freaking selfish. And the fact that everybody admired her and liked her was quite baffling, as she was incredibly self-serving and thoughtless. I did like the Afghan characters. And Michener treated them and the country with respect and admiration, something you don't always see in American literature about non-western countries. All in all, I am glad I read the book. It was worth putting up with the human characters to get to know the geographical one."}, {"userName": "Deb", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5606654-deb", "userReview": "\"The novel centers on Mark Miller, a young American diplomat stationed in 1946 Kabul, who is charged to find Ellen, a college-age woman who married an American-educated Afghan named Nazrullah and then disappeared in Afghanistan. He eventually finds her among a group of nomads. Miller\u2019s traveling companion, meanwhile, is Dr. Otto Stiglitz, a Nazi war criminal.This story is Afghanistan in 1946; written in 1963 about the then-largely unknown country of Afghanistan I learned a lot about the very old, 'bronze age' culture and the interesting terrain. \u201cKabul today shows what Palestine was like at the time of Jesus.\u201d Because of US wars, I recognize names and places. Loads of historical and information and travelogue scenery--and that's why I give it 3 stars. Otherwise, the characters and story are pretty flat, certainly outmoded and there is NO great insight into the psychology of the characters. The story is weak. It is good enough to keep you reading, but not enthralling by any means. The travelogue is magnificent. Michener presented much insight into Afghanistan BEFORE the modern age, BEFORE modern powers got completely immeshed, BEFORE the height of the Cold War, BEFORE Russian and US invaded, BEFORE globalization brought America closer to Asia. His 3 Afghan characters shared their hopes and fears for their country as it moved to modernization! Loved that...especially with our knowledge about what really happened to the Afghans. Michener also touched on the political complexity for Afghans and their mullahs; influence of the US-educated Afghans; urban-dwellers vs rural nomads; and, the Americans, Russians and English competing for advantage. He even brought in the Nazi atrocities through a German doctor."}, {"userName": "Bryce Holt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2084139-bryce-holt", "userReview": "A beautiful stroll across the entire country of Afghanistan right after World War 2, \"Caravans\" pays homage to the passionate and remarkable people of Afghanistan instead of focusing on the negatives that the country often currently is associated with. If your heart doesn't sing to go see this place after you've read it, well...you and I must be very different people.By reading a book published in 1963, you see a part of the world that has a current stigma from a completely different vantage point than we see it now. There wasn't horrible relationships between our two countries at that point. Afghans weren't known for terrorist acts and, vice versa, America wasn't known as some sort of evil occupation by certain sects of locals (at least not in the way it is now). You're looking at a country trying to build itself into something...a people who rely on one another and their meager assets to get by, work together and build something out of a seemingly endless stretch of nothing. You realize that the arid plateaus and dingy towns are a much smaller segment of this foreign land, and instead find yourself enamored with the valleys of the Hindu Kush and the monuments hidden among the sandstorms and desert hills.We need to get back to these books. It's sad that we've forgotten these people and places are what countries are about, not what the military and militias have made of them.

Each time I read one I do enjoy the history. However, there's something about his style that just doesn't resonate with me.Given that, Caravans takes you on a whirlwind adventure into the heart of Afghanistan in 1946. A young, American Jewish consulate worker is sent to find a missing American woman who married an Afghan because she despises her father for his bourgeouis American lifestyle.Traveling through the country you get a glimpse of Afghanistan's culture, history, economics and society in the 1950s - before any of the more recent changes altered the country. On the up side Michener was extremely prophetic in his analysis of the region stating that either the Russians or Americans would eventually be drawn into this country (considering he wrote this in 1963). There is also no doubt of his deep love for both the people and the country at the time he was there in the 1950s - it easily comes through his writing.If you're interested in Afghanistan history - this book would be a great starting point if you can get through the insipid male chauvinism and homo-eroticism scattered within.

It's told from the point of view of an American embassy worker who travels around the country, first to look for an American girl who married an Afghan and then disappeared, and later to determine whether the Russians were sneaking into Afghanistan to try to take over.The author put a note at the end of the book, telling the reader how things had changed in the 17 years since the story was set (about 1963), and it was a very hopeful note. Two years later, there was a Marxist party in Afghanistan and 13 years after that, the Soviets began to deploy troops in the country officially. They were there for 11 years, and five years after that, the Taliban began to exercise influence in the country. They destroyed the Buddhas of Bamiam (mentioned in CARAVANS) in March of 2001, and in less than a month after 9/11, the US became involved in a war there.I have to wonder what Michener would have thought of all that has happened since his note was added to the book."}, {"userName": "Julie Davis", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2125014-julie-davis", "userReview": "I read one Michener book, The Source, long ago ... in fact, long before I became Christian ... just as a compelling way to travel through the history and people of a region.

As I discarded author after author, I found myself captivated by the couple of Michener samples I'd downloaded (specifically Caravans and The Source). And I realized I'd forgotten his shorter fiction such as Sayonara and The Bridges at Toko-Ri.Like an H.V. Morton travel guide, but with a fictional veneer, Michener takes the reader through all the faces of 1946 Afghanistan from city life to nomad caravans, while simultaneously pondering civilization, faith, and man's essential nature. Written in 1966, this book also contains pondering from those who adhere to traditional thinking versus those who feel that progress means breaking away from civilization.
