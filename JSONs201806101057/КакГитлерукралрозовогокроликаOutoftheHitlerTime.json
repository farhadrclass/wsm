Finally when trying to think of a different book to read to my own kids I asked a bookseller if they knew a book of that name (not having a clue who had written it). My two boys were absolutely riveted although rather bemused when I sobbed through the more emotional bits (nine and seven year old boys may be slightly lacking in soul!) It is beautifully written. On the whole it presents a positive view of the family's refugee experience, as would be expected from an adventurous child's view, despite the intrusion of nazism and its associated horrors into their lives. The edition we have has all sorts of facts about the war and rationing, etc at the end which really helped to bring things alive for my boys. If you have children - read it to them, if you don't enjoy it yourself!"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa", "userReview": "What a beautiful story! When I started reading the book I expected another sorrowful account of the worst time in history, but in the end I closed the book with a smile on my face and the thought that everybody should read this book to be encouraged to deal with change in a new way. (Me included!)Anna tells the story the odyssey her family is forced to undertake in 1933, when Hitler grasps power in Germany and her family has to leave Berlin in a hurry - being Jewish and politically active against the Nazis. They move first to Switzerland, then Paris, and finally to England. Anna reflects on how she and her brother adjust to the different environments they encounter, how they struggle with different school systems and languages. My favourite part is when she almost gives up learning to speak French and then suddenly realises she can do it. When the family moves on to England, she has new confidence in her ability to adapt, and she starts out with the knowledge that she might not be able to understand a word right now, but if she gives it a couple of months, she will talk without any difficulty. In a globalised world, that is a necessary attitude!Another charm of the book is the child's perspective of historical events. When Anna and her brother hear that the Nazis have taken all their belongings in Germany, they imagine Hitler playing with their board game collection and the stuffed pink rabbit Anna had to leave behind. Hitler's presence in their lives is personal and direct, they can't understand the actual happenings. Anna has a nightmare when she hears that the Nazis have put a prize on her father's head. She literally dreams that coins are falling down threatening to crush him. A perfect class novel to deal with human migration, change, language difficulties, history and family life in general."}, {"userName": "Glorrry", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32073432-glorrry", "userReview": "4,5'tan 5"}, {"userName": "Sally906", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4949011-sally906", "userReview": "WHEN HITLER STOLE PINK RABBIT is semi-autobiographical as it is based on the true life story of author Judith Kerr. Her family fled Germany just before Hitler came to power because her father was a well-known writer, and had been openly criticizing the Nazis. Anna is 9 when the story opens and she first learns she is a Jew. She hadn\u2019t realised she was one as her family didn\u2019t follow any of the customs or worship as Jews. One day her father disappears he has been told he is a wanted man by the Nazi\u2019s and if they come to power he will be in big trouble. Not long after the family also sneak out of Germany as they are worried their passports will be taken. Not wishing to arouse suspicion all they can take is one small bag each \u2013 Pink Rabbit is left behind as Anna thinks they are coming back. Just after they arrive in Switzerland to join Anna\u2019s father Hitler wins the election and now has supreme power in Germany.WHEN HITLER STOLE PINK RABBIT is written from a child\u2019s point of view, so innocently we see how a once well-off family finds themselves to be now poor and struggling to make ends meet. This loss of income results in Anna\u2019s practical mother learning to cook and sew, which is contrasted by her impractical father who didn\u2019t understand that his children were growing and needed new clothes. Downsizing their rent and increasing her father\u2019s employment prospects by moving from Switzerland to Paris and then on to London was another adjustment the family needed to do. As an adult reading between the lines I could see how the rise to power of one small angry man could affect millions of lives across Europe, and the impact on the family of being in extreme danger from the Nazi\u2019s and then having no money for food or heating would really have been \u2013 rather than the adventure that Anna thought she was on. Overall it is very well written, the right voice for the age of the narrator, funny even in parts with some bad events alluded to rather than in your face."}, {"userName": "In\u00e9s Izal", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25759167-in-s-izal", "userReview": "-3.5-\"Algunas cosas hab\u00edan sido dif\u00edciles, pero siempre hab\u00eda sido interesante, y a menudo divertido: y mam\u00e1 y pap\u00e1 y Max y ella casi siempre hab\u00edan estado juntos.

I know that many friends of mine had to read it in school but for some reason, I never had to. Nevertheless, I always thought that it is an important novel that I should have read. Thus, last year, I bought it but then forgot about it again. Last week, when I was in bed sick with the flu, I was going through the books in my shelf I have not read yet and there it was and grabbed my attention. I started reading it in the morning and read it in one day even though I had to take breaks because I couldn\u2018t concentrate anymore due to my illness.Being German, I was always interested in the past of my home country even though the history of Germany is so cruel and sad. But especially because it is like that I think that it is really important to educate our kids about this dreadful part of our history and to explain why things have happened and how they could have been avoided in order to make sure that something like this will never happen again. In Germany this is done very well in school and after reading this novel, I can see why many people read it during their school time.Judith Kerr did a fantastic job describing this part of the German history from the view of a Jewish family escaping from Nazi Germany. She finds a way of explaining things in a kids and teenager friendly way as well as delivering a story that is entertaining and nice to read. In some parts it is even funny and the reader forgets about the terrible things that have happened at the same time. The story is based on her real life and describes how she and her family escape from Germany first to Switzerland, then to France and finally to Britain. It shows a young girl growing up under extremely difficult circumstances. She needs to adapt to new countries, new surroundings, new people and, even more difficult, to new languages over and over again. But while all this is happening the only thing that matters to her is that her family stays together. She manages all problems no matter how hard situations may appear. This is something everybody should see as a role model because it can even help nowadays. The story shows that no matter how difficult life can be there is always something that matters more than money or valuables and that are the people surrounding you.When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit is a story that gives hope and perfectly explains the most important bits of history of the Nazi time. The book can be read by young and old equally. In the end, I felt as if I was part of this little family who just wanted to live a normal life together somewhere without having to fear for their lives. The family does not even feel at home anywhere because their home was taken away from them and at the end they are still on the run but I like how even this horrible situation is turned into something positive by the father in the end: \u201cWe\u2018ll belong a little in lots of places, and I think that may be just as good.\u201c They always kept their chins up and eventually they got out of their situation even stronger than before and that is something I consider as the most important message of this novel.Thanks to Judith Kerr for sharing her own experiences and for enriching us with this great book!Read more of my reviews here: http://booksaroundtheworld.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Laleh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17905535-laleh", "userReview": "I've always been quite keen on childrens books about the second world war. There's a kind of simplicity in the way they cover it, that always makes it feel more real to me.Carrie's War, Goodnight Mister Tom, The Kingdom by the Sea, The Machine Gunners, Blitzed...have all at some point or other been one of my favourite booksI'd been looking for this book for quite a while, and chanced upon it a while ago.It was a sweet book, with the main difference being that it didn't dive as deeply into the War as the others did. There was no talk of bombs, and death was only lightly mentioned. Hitler was mostly shown as a terrible man who was a very long way away and so didn't cause much bother, except for it being harder to make money...All in all I liked it, the text was simple and smooth, but if you're looking for a childrens book on the war, Goodnight Mister Tom is a better option (it gives a better overall picture, but does not have the sometimes disturbing scenes that crop up in the other books I mentioned)"}, {"userName": "\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e2d \u0e2a\u0e35\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37272438", "userReview": "\u0e08\u0e30\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e44\u0e1b \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e21\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e19\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e15\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e27\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e31\u0e15\u0e34\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1c\u0e39\u0e49\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e34\u0e07\u0e40\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01\u0e46 \u0e27\u0e31\u0e22 9 \u0e02\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e35\u0e49\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e14\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e27\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e22\u0e34\u0e27\u0e19\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e01\u0e23\u0e13\u0e35\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e14\u0e35 \u0e16\u0e36\u0e07\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e25\u0e27\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e22\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e15\u0e40\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e17\u0e33\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e21\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e42\u0e28\u0e01\u0e19\u0e32\u0e0f\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21 \u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e17\u0e32\u0e23\u0e38\u0e13\u0e08\u0e34\u0e15\u0e43\u0e08\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e15\u0e38\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e43\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e27\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e1e\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e01\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e08\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e49\u0e19\u0e41\u0e21\u0e49\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e19\u0e27\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e08\u0e30\u0e14\u0e39\u0e44\u0e17\u0e49\u0e22\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e01\u0e47\u0e40\u0e14\u0e49\u0e01\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e01\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e19\u0e27\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1c\u0e39\u0e49\u0e41\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e19\u0e30\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e19\u0e08\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e33\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e14\u0e14\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e01\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e31\u0e15\u0e34\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e14\u0e39\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e01\u0e46 \u0e2d\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e42\u0e25\u0e01\u0e17\u0e31\u0e28\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e19\u0e40\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01\u0e46\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e15\u0e38\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e43\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e07\u0e04\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21\u0e42\u0e25\u0e01\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48 2 \u0e44\u0e1b\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22"}, {"userName": "\u00dcmit Mutlu", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5707086-mit-mutlu", "userReview": "II.

Anna and Max's parents shielded them from the fear of what they suspected was going to happen, so even the fact that their famous journalist father felt that he was in danger so that the whole family had to leave, did not make them truly scared. They knew that it was important that they didn't tell anybody that their father had already gone to Switzerland, but there was no terror when they left themselves, although their mother was obviously nervous. The time in Switzerland was more or less idyllic, but the family had to move on to Paris so that Papa could earn a living.The strength of the book is not so much that it reveals much about WWII, but that it tells the feelings of a young girl who had to adjust to life in a strange country and learn a new language; it is the refugee or expat experience, rather than the Jewish experience, and it is brought down to the level at which a child experiences it. As in 'The Diary of Anne Frank', we hear about the daily irritations, the problems of a family living in reduced circumstances; the mother who had to learn how to cook and keep house, the impractical father who didn't understand, the children who were outgrowing their clothes, all against the background of the Depression. Yet the family adapted and was happy nevertheless, and only in the fact that they had to flee their country at all is a hint of what was happening to the Jews, apart from a few isolated incidents, such as the tale of the famous man in the kennel and Onkel Julius, but this is all told at one remove, remote from their own lives.This is a very interesting book, and told in a way which would appeal to children around the time they go to senior school. It gives a good picture of the \"make do and mend\" way of life which their grandparents grew up in, and which now only seems to be led by people who are seriously interested in recycling. Children nowadays wouldn't believe that most children in those days would not have had many clothes, and that they would be patched and mended when necessary. Food also seems to be an obsession in Judith Kerr's books, probably due to the rationing she experienced as she was growing up. In this book, food is often described, and in 'The Tiger Who Came to Tea', a tiger visits and eats and drinks everything so that the family has to go out for dinner at a caf\u00e9, an occurrence which would have been rare in the 1970s when both books were written. I would imagine that those of us who grew up in the '70s and '80s would find it easier to imagine than today's children who have grown up in a much more affluent society, and to whom the 1930s seem like ancient history. All the more reason, then, to give them easily accessible stories such as this one to bring the period alive.I am hoping that my 10-year-old daughter can be persuaded to let me read it to her, as she took one look at the cover illustration (a serious-looking dark-haired girl clutching a pink rabbit, in her coat, hat and scarf, standing next to a suitcase, and in the background a large swastica), and decided it wasn't for her age-group, used as she is to bright colours and frivolous subjects. I wonder what the latest cover looks like, as I am pretty sure that other children would also be put off by such an illustration.Bookcrossing: ApoloniaX's bookray, http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/8..."}, {"userName": "Aliyah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41115013-aliyah", "userReview": "Why can\u2019t we stay in Germany?

Fearing for their safety, Anna\u2019s family move to 3 different countries in the course of a few short years. Anna must learn new languages and customs and make new friends. Each time she is finally making headway, she has to leave it all behind and start again. While some would say her childhood is one of difficulty, she is happy. She has the remarkable ability to find joy in the hard times. And she knows that as long as her family stay together, everything will be ok. When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit is written in a way that reflects the real dangers of the author\u2019s own childhood while still having a lightheartedness about it. I think it is aimed at younger readers, but I still enjoyed reading it. On the surface it\u2019s a sweet refugee story from the perspective of a little girl, but if you dig deeper you come to realize that there is so much more to it. There are underlying themes of the desire to be accepted, the strength that comes from the unity of family, and the way that various cultures are compatible with each other even when they have so many differences. This book contrasts many war-time stories in that Anna is not an orphan \u2013 she always has her parents with her. Also, there isn\u2019t lots of worry about Hitler - the book focuses more on how the family will survive as refugees. I recommend When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit for ages 8 and up and give it 3 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Beth Bonini", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3106785-beth-bonini", "userReview": "This book is probably best aimed at the 9-12 age reader, and yet -- like all well-written books -- it will appeal to many older readers. It is Judith Kerr's memoir of being a German/Jewish refugee as a child, and it is both fascinating and poignant. Although the author sticks to facts and memories, as much as possible, the book is presented as fiction -- she distances herself with the third-person point-of-view, and by referring to herself as \"Anna\" (which actually was one of her names, as she explains in the Author's Note).As a popular and well-known critic of Hitler's Nazi party, Judith's father Alfred Kerr was at the top of Hitler's enemy list. Tipped off by a sympathetic policeman, Kerr left Berlin for Prague the week before the election which swept the Nazi party into totalitarian power. Judith, her older brother and mother left the day before the election; just in the knick of time, it turns out, as their passports would have been confiscated the next day. The family then become refugees, moving from Switzerland to Paris and then finally to England -- where they settle. Anna, from a child's point of view, describes each new world -- and her experiences of learning how to fit in, make friends, negotiate a different educational system, and in the case of France, learn a new language. For the most part, Anna presents a positive, optimistic view of the change in her circumstances . . . for her, it is all an adventure. An adult reading the book will interpret things rather differently, particularly as the family's economic situation becomes ever more precarious. There are a few moments of true sadness -- the fate of their friend Onkel Julius comes to mind -- but you rarely feel an adult consciousness impinging on the perspective of the more innocent Anna. There are hints of the worsening situation for German Jews in the years of 1933-36, but the book doesn't really touch on the horrors to come."}, {"userName": "LH Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5230131-lh-johnson", "userReview": "This book is one of those that feel somehow effortless, as if they were just waiting to be written. Kerr's fictionalised story of her childhood is, and deserves to be, one of those eternal classics of children's literature. Anna (Judith) is growing up in Germany. She is Jewish, and her father is a famous writer. Following the rise of Nazism, and the climate becoming increasingly fragile in Germany, her parents make the decision to leave. This book follows Anna throughout the first part of her journey, from Germany to Switzerland to France and finally to England. The story is then continued in the much darker The Other Way Round.Anna is young, an innocent in many ways, and we see their journey through her eyes. Kerr's ability is immense in this book, and she delivers the story in a simple, graceful style. It's a quiet book in many parts, reminiscent stylistically of Noel Streatfield's A Vicarage Family, but one that dips into the shadows of imminent war without reservation. There's parts in this book that I remember from my first reading, many years ago, and the impact they had then has not lessened. It's hard not to love the family because of the palpable nature of Kerr's writing. There's a repeated motif of family throughout the book, and the emphatic suggestion that Anna does not mind what happens as long as they are all together. It all adds up to make an idealistic, yet incredibly poignant read."}, {"userName": "Cris", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33748885-cris", "userReview": "No debemos dejarnos enga\u00f1ar por el t\u00edtulo y la ambientaci\u00f3n; no estamos ante una narraci\u00f3n sobre la Segunda Guerra Mundial al uso.

Kerr was born in Berlin in 1923. Her family chose to flee Germany just before the Nazis came to power because her father, Alfred Kerr, a well-known writer, had openly criticized this regime. When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit is Kerr\u2019s autobiographical novel about their flight.The book begins just before the March 1933 election. Things are pretty good for Anna, 9, and her older brother, Max. They do well in school and enjoy playing with their friends. They are Jewish, but secular Jews. But one day her father disappears and Anna learns that he has traveled to Prague. He had been warned that he would be a wanted man by the Nazis depending on what happened in the upcoming election. A few days before the election, the Reichstag Fire occurs and it is decided that the rest of the family would now travel to Switzerland to meet up with him. All household goods are packed and put into storage, including all the toys and games that belong to the children. Their Onkle Julius, who happens to have had a Jewish grandmother, but thinks he is safe and that the Nazis won\u2019t last anyway, is sorry to see them go, but expects the family back with a short time.The train to Switzerland is a harrowing adventure. There is always the fear that the passports will be questioned or worse, taken from them, barring entry to Switzerland. But everything goes well and the family arrives in Zurich and are all reunited. They soon learn that the Nazis had shown up at their home in Berlin to collect their passports the morning after the election that gave Hitler supreme power in Germany. The formerly well off family suddenly finds themselves very poor and Anna\u2019s father can find very little work as a writer/journalist. Despite their neutrality, the Swiss don\u2019t want provoke the Nazis right across the border. Nevertheless, Anna and her family remain in Switzerland for about a year, living in two small, inexpensive rooms at a Gasthof. It is very pleasant there; in fact, the only unpleasant incidents are from German visitors who refuse to let their children play with Jews.It is later decided to move to Paris, in the hope of getting more paid work. Once again the family find themselves living in a small, inexpensive apartment. There are many adjustment difficulties, such as Max and Anna are expected to attend school and learn French at the same time. Food and money are scarce, and everyone is beginning to get on each other\u2019s nerves. But they make friends with the Fernand family, which gives them some social outlet. Eventually, the family makes it way to London, where things are expected to work out better for the family. When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit is an uncomplicated book, told from the point of view of a child, which Kerr was when she lived through these events. Yet, if you read between the lines, it is a much more multifaceted story for anyone who knows something about the history of that period of time in Nazi Germany. And Onkle Julius is typical of many people who believed that things would get better, that heritage didn\u2019t count and by the time they realized the danger they were in, it was too late to leave Germany.I did feel that Kerr\u2019s depiction of what life is like as a refugee may have been a little too rose-colored, and since I felt that the character of Anna never really grew, so she saw everything rather naively. The incidents where the family faced some serious danger from the Nazis were well done, but the day to day existence of having no money and being cold, hungry or afraid were really skimmed over. On the other hand, Kerr is a self-proclaimed optimist and I am not. Yet, I do feel that this is a book that should be read by both children and adults.This book is recommended for readers age 9 and up.This book was purchased for my person library."}, {"userName": "Terri Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5699299-terri-lynn", "userReview": "I have been meaning to read this since I was 12 in 1971 when it first came out and finally have gotten around to it. I'm glad I did. This is the story of a nonreligious family of cultural Jews who were smart enough to get out of Berlin right at the time of Hitler's election. The father, a famous journalist and Nazi critic, got word that if Hitler was elected the Nazis were going to take his passport so he slipped out of the country to Prague and then to Switzerland a short time before the election. He then had his wife, daughter Anna, and son Max take the train to Switzerland beginning the day before the election and completing their journey on election day.The \"pink rabbit\" referred to in the title was Anna's stuffed pink rabbit she had had since she was a baby. She chose to take a newer stuffed dog instead (why couldn't she take both?). The family thought they would come back if Hitler was not elected but he was and then installed himself as Fuhrer and so their things they had stored were all seized, including pink rabbit. Anna regretted leaving it behind as it had been her lovey. My own daughter still has her stuffed black lab puppy toy. In Switzerland, the father cannot get any of the papers to buy his articles. They want to maintain neutrality and he has strong words against the Nazis that could bring trouble in on them. The family later moves to Paris and finally to London. If you are homeschooling or if you teach in a school, obviously this is a great book to share but it must not be the only one you share lest children believe that things were easier than they were. You see, this book makes it look as if Jews who fled the Nazis had it fairly easy. For example, the family was forewarned that the father's passport was likely to be taken so he just hops a train to Prague and then to Switzerland. Money was no problem. He had his wife and kids come to Switzerland and they spent over a month in an expensive hotel and had the doctor in daily due to Anna becoming seriously ill. All meals for all the family were bought in the hotel. Most Jews could not afford to do all of this for a family of 4. They lived for a while in another hotel and again, no one is working. This was not the situation for most Jews. Only once did they run into a bigoted Nazi family.Then they just moved to Paris, rented a place, placed the kids in school, and lived on the few articles he could sell to a radical paper.While times were harder for them, they never went hungry, had a roof over their heads, the kids went to school, and they were clothed. The worst problem was the kids trying to learn French. Finally, when the dad saw a composition Anna did on Napoleon, he wrote his first screenplay which he sold to a Hungarian film company in London and they all dashed there to live. Please! With London being blitzed and a depression on, what is the likelihood that someone's first screenplay is going to be bought for a large price by a Hungarian company in London when he can't even sell articles to the paper and sight unseen? It's a good story but I would include a lot more realistic material and remind children that this is more fairy tale than fact when it comes to the real lives of those Jews who fled Hitler."}, {"userName": "Hannah Mead", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75819614-hannah-mead", "userReview": "When you are nine, things happening in the outside world shouldn\u2019t bother you, right? Yes, grownups fret and worry, but you are a child, so you don\u2019t. That is how it should be. But that is not how it was for nine year old Anna, in 1933. All of a sudden, that strange grownup world of worry and fear tore into her safe childhood bubble. There was a strange name on everyone\u2019s lips \u2013 Hitler, and there were far too many secrets and whispered conversations. Anna\u2019s world as she had known it for her whole life began to fall apart at the seams, and with one train ride, it fell apart, never to be the same again.When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit is actually quite an interesting book. Most books about WWII focus in on the action \u2013 the fighting, the spying, the concentration camps, the Jews. But not this one. This story never goes into fighting territory, it never visits the concentration camps. Instead, it moves away from the conflict, focusing instead on the upheaval in Anna\u2019s personal life. It zooms in on the tension surrounding one family\u2019s heritage, and follows them as they move from country to country, in search of safe refuge from Hitler\u2019s wide and wild reach. I think this is a pretty unique approach to WWII, I can\u2019t remember having read anything that is like it before. I enjoyed the story \u2013 is well written and I felt like I connected well with Anna, the main character. However, this book didn\u2019t make a huge impression on me \u2013 looking back on it a few weeks after reading it, I only remember it as a story of a girl and her family trying to find home in a war-torn continent. But the clincher is that they never encounter the war on a face to face level, they always seem to be one or two steps ahead of it. I\u2019m pretty familiar with the history of WWII, and so this book didn\u2019t teach me much I didn\u2019t already know in that area. There is also the slight issue in that I am rather above the projected audience of this book, so I suspect I found it unremarkable because I\u2019m older and have had quite a bit of experience in reading about WWII. But if you are looking to find a good introduction to the impact that WWII had on normal citizens of Europe, then this book will be a good one for you. The story is sweet, and I really appreciated the emphasis on the importance of a strong family unit.

Her dad decides to move the family, because he is worried that if Hitler is elected that he would take his job away. At the time her dad is a journalist. They end up moving all around Europe.I didn't enjoy reading this particular book. There were many things about this book that I did not like. I don't suggest read When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit. In the beginning I thought that it was going to be good. I thought that the family would get stopped by Hitler when they were leaving the country. Nothing happened. The book was mainly about the family moving and where they lived. I felt like the book didn\u2019t involve Hitler as much as it should have. If the title of the book has Hitler in it then you would think that Hitler is going to be a major role and the pink rabbit was only spoken of once in the book. The only time that the author mentions a pink rabbit was when Anna was trying to decide what stuff animal she wanted to take with her on the move. I also didn\u2019t like the ending. It just left me hanging. The book ending with the family in a new country and they were getting into a cab.

I finally decided to pick it up again and read it(which felt like for the first time since I hadn't retained any details, just a feeling that I liked it).Based on the author and her experiences, this book provides a unique insight to WWII from a child's perspective.It's easy to let Anna's voice of adventure and naivety sway you into thinking that what is going on at the time isn't so bad. Anna has a positive outlook on everything. There are tiny threads of more serious things woven into the tale that jerk you back to reality that no, this was not sunshine and roses.Big or little wrongs, they all mattered.Anna's family had to flee their country, they lost their land, their house, their longtime servant, their things. Anna's father lost his job, his respect. His books were burned. People were afraid to hire him or publish his things.No, it wasn't the WORST thing going on at the time, but that by no means makes these things not-terrible. They are. They're horrible things to have happen to a person or a family.There's a story about a well-educated man who was kept like a dog in a camp until he lost his mind. There's the uncle who was one of those sweet, simple type people. He liked his job, modest as it was. He liked going to the zoo and seeing the animals. I cried near the end when his story is finished being told.The message from Anna about how \"at least we have each other\" and to always go forward with all of your heart, no matter what you leave behind, are great things for anyone to learn. And considering her age and what her family was going through, it makes her all the more deserving of respect. I think this is a great choice for children or adults. To learn to be grateful for what we have. To appreciate our loved ones. And to not forget that wrongs come in all forms.
