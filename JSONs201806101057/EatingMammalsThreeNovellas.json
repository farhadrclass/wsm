His book Eating Mammals sat for years in the bargain section of the Barnes & Noble website before I bothered to buy a copy. Every summer and winter, every twice-yearly clearance sale for years, I scrolled through the list of cheap, bargain, clearance books, picking out the ones that caught my eye, adding to the ever-growing pile of cheap short story collections I had bought from other seasonal B&N clearance sales--and every time, Eating Mammals got left behind. Never made the final cut. Usually I just scrolled past on the way to other cheap books. Then came the day I scrolled through the list of story collections and found nothing. I had picked the bargain section clean, and now I was faced with a handful of, well, leftovers. I very nearly skipped the sale (did I really need more cheap books?) but Barlow's book caught my eye once more. Fine! I thought. Whatever! I'll buy you! But you'd better be worth the $1.99 I'm paying, or I shall be very cross!Result: $1.99 well spent. Sorry I doubted you, cheap clearance book.Eating Mammals: Three Novellas contains three quirky, comic, and clever little stories with little hints of magic and whimsy tossed in for flair. The narrator of the title story, an unlucky hotel cook, becomes apprentice to The Great Michael \"Cast Iron\" Mulligan, a champion eater famous for consuming anything, organic or not; though the young, newly-christened Captain Gusto learns at the feet (and belly) of a master masticator, he is unlucky enough to come into a world where \"eating anything\" is a dying and unappreciated art. In \"The Possession of Thomas-Bessie: A Victorian Melodrama,\" a winged cat becomes the talk of England, more for the lives it ruins than the oddities it wears on its back. And \"The Donkey Wedding at Gomersal, Told by An Inhabitant of That Place\" will, if nothing else, make you crave a good meat pie. A bit of a mixed collection--the first novella is great, the third is good, the second fun but slightly too long--Eating Mammals is good stuff. Give it a try. I don't know why I had such low expectations, really; maybe in my old ultra-frugal days I was just loathe to pay a few bucks for three novellas when the same few bucks could get me a collection of a dozen stories or more (that's right--I like short stories because I'm poor!). But hey, a pleasant surprise is a pleasant surprise, and I can safely say I like John Barlow's work. I might even pay full price for it next time!"}, {"userName": "Moira Burke", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3322570-moira-burke", "userReview": "\"Witty, bizarre tales with ridiculous descriptions of appetite and girth. First, we have the professional eater: One evening, after a particularly successful show in which he had performed a routine entitled Americana (forty-eight hot dogs, one for each star; thirteen slices of apple pie, one for each stripe; twenty-eight cups of punch, one for each president; and a brandy for Lincoln), he was approached by a thin, fragile man who spoke in a strange accent, and who had the eves of someone who expects yes for an answer. Laden with a stomach full of borrowed patriotism, yet happy with his performance, Michael listened with great interest to the proposal.And the gypsy:Inside, sitting in an armchair which seemed to occupy the whole far end of the caravan, was an enormous woman. 'Well! Come on! Let's have a look!' she said, bursting into life and hauling herself some inches up from her seat. But she flopped straight back down; the idea of getting up had been a bad one. So there she sat. And there seemed to be no end to her. Instead, there was a general movement of things which must have belonged to her body in some way. She spilled over the arms of the chair and out on to the floor in rolls and odd-shaped dollops of woman, and spread up behind her own shoulder, upwards and outwards, in all directions. She seemed to be nothing more than a big fat face grafted on to the back half of the caravan's chintz interior, her flabby mouth speaking not for a human being but as a mouthpiece for the whole dwelling.And the policemen with a new cat:For three weeks at Dewsbury Central Police Station, food and affection were in limitless supply. Each morning a mountain of breakfast scraps was put down for the new visitor, and throughout the day there was a never-ending series of meals and snacks and elevenses and tea breaks. The Dewsbury Constabulary, it seemed, marched on its stomach, and there were some substantial ones. Hardly an hour passed without the laying down of newspapers and pencils for a fresh round of gorging, always washed down with sweet tea, and always a saucer of it put down for the cat. The poor thing had no choice but to leave whole plates of titbits untouched, and this eventually served as a gentle hint that a cat's needs are really quite modest in comparison to a policeman's.\""}, {"userName": "Lauren ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7141908-lauren", "userReview": "The three novellas of this book's title are: the title story 'Eating Mammals' which is about a professional eater called Captain Gusto, (kind of like Kobayashi Takeru only he'll literally eat anything), 'The Possession of Thomas-Bessie: a Victorian Melodrama' about a strange cat, born with a pair of small wings (don't worry, it's not in the least cutesy or cat-fancieresque), and finally 'The Donkey Wedding at Gomersal, recounted by an inhabitant of that place' about a rather odd wedding (I'll let you guess what exactly was odd about it).They're all good solid stories, engagingly written, but the title story takes the cake, so to speak. I don't want to spoil it, but one of the last scenes is so perfectly, viscerally, stomach-churningly written that I literally felt sick reading it. Anyone can write a gross-out scene, but this is different, it was kind of a gross-out elevated to the level of art.I recommend this book to all comers (provided they have a strong stomach) and I invite you to check out the author's first full-length novel 'Intoxicated', which I'm eagerly looking forward to reading."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1284151-holly", "userReview": "Three novellas, all focused around 'mammals' and 'eating'. The first story was my favorite starting off, but got sort of slow towards the end. The second story was mediocre, and the third story I didn't think I would like, but turned out to be my absolute favorite. It also made me sort of hungry. I admit, I bought it for the title, and because it was on the Bargain Rack at Barnes & Nobles, but all in all, I wasn't disappointed. And:I practically devoured it (lol) in my haste to finish. It was really funny and also a little bit gross at one part, but overall, something really lighthearted and perfect for me to pass the time with. It's a collection of three novellas focussed on 'mammals' and 'eating' in some way, but the first and the last one were my favorites. If you're bored and want something really funny (and really gross) to read, this is the book for you."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david", "userReview": "Three novellas, best described as \"quirky\". The title is puzzling, because although eating is a prominent theme in two of the stories, it has no obvious relevance to the longest novella, \"The Possession of Thomas-Bessie\" (a Victorian melodrama), the tale of the winged cat of Yorkshire and the misfortunes of those who tried to possess him. The stories are amusing, though the author's style is somewhat rambling, and the first and third stories are weak as far as plot is concerned. There are a couple of very explicit descriptions of graphic violence to animals, one of which seemed entirely gratuitous.I enjoyed the winged cat story most; the other two were unobjectionable but forgettable. The author does have a certain dry (British?) humor which I quite enjoyed."}, {"userName": "Sarah Menezes", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4482416-sarah-menezes", "userReview": "Maybe more like a 3 3/4 stars, but now I'm just getting ridiculous. This three-novella collection was very enjoyable, humorous, well-written, and incredibly British. Although each of the novella's stories have very different subject matter, they all connect in theme and even in time an place setting, giving a good sense of the English Victorian era and classic British humor.Plus anything with flying cats and pork-pies always gets a gold-star from this end."}, {"userName": "Sarah Key", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2068329-sarah-key", "userReview": "This book was pathetic.

Being three short novellas, I read one at a time, across the year. This is a set of stories deeply in love with old times. The most recent story (the first and titular one) still takes place before the age of television. The other two feel far more medieval. With the Donkey Wedding, that old mood leaves the narrative a bit dry (though the meat pies, in description, made me hungry throughout). The story of Thomas-Bessie, a winged cat, is far more engaging, with the feline oddity the subject of much speculation and superstition, to say nothing of the ownership quarrels. The title text is its own oddity, a story of upper class wealth mixing with the desperation of the entertainer. I'd lean this toward at least a 3.5 if such things could be added on Goodreads."}, {"userName": "Nitya Sivasubramanian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78611-nitya-sivasubramanian", "userReview": "What the hell did I just read?No seriously!For some reason, this book managed to hit all of my major distastes, and yet I kept reading, hoping against hope to find something I would like.

They all seem to take place in the earlier half of this century or earlier, and they all have a slightly creepy vibe I wouldn't call horror, but maybe uneasiness? One is about a winged cat that is feared by some, loved by others, and coveted by a lot of people who see it as a money-maker. You never know if the cat has any good or evil to it, but it does cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people. The other story is about a guy who makes a living doing a sideshow act where he grinds things up and eats them. He can eat anything as long as it is ground up and he drinks this lubricating juice with it, but times get hard and the things he is forced to eat get worse and worse."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/351657-susan", "userReview": "Though the \"mammal\" theme seems a bit tenuous as a link, all three of the novellas are enjoyable in their own ways, all set against a Victorian backdrop. Overall, I felt the first to be the strongest overall, with the second the most Gothic in feel, and the third the funniest. The first novella has a bit of shock value towards the end but make no mistake, this is not a tale that glorifies animal cruelty but an exploration of performance, exploitation, the lies that we tell ourselves, and the price we pay for them...and a pretty darn good one at that."}, {"userName": "Fellini", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6114479-fellini", "userReview": "\u0421\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0440\u0451\u0445 \"\u044f\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445\" \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439, \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0445, \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0445. \u0412 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043a \u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435 \u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u043b\u044c\u044f, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439, \u0441\u0438\u0430\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0446\u044b, \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0430. \u0420\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u043e\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \"\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u043c\". \u041d\u0443 \u0434\u0430, \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u0433\u0440\u044f\u0437\u0438 \u0432 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u043d\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u043c?"}, {"userName": "Katy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5552109-katy", "userReview": "I picked this up on a whim when I had a gift certificate and read it in the mid '00s.

Boyle,Steven Millhauser, and Michel Faber -- with a penchant forthe macabre worthy of Irvine Welsh -- comes Eating Mammals.Gypsies, businessmen, servants, masters, and unwise children come together in three mythical tales from Victorian England. Eating Mammals evokes a lost time and place in which the realm of the magical seems almost too possible: a winged cat wreaks havoc in a Yorkshire workhouse and then in the minds of a succession of owners; a famed stunt eater introduces his apprentice, Captain Gusto, to the delicate art of devouring anything for a living; a blooming romance between two meat-pie makers leads thirty-two adorned donkeys to the altar.
