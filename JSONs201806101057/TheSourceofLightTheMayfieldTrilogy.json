The story is of a girl, Sam (Samantha) who lives in Mississippi in the early 60s when the push to get black people registered to vote has begun, much to the dislike of many who believe in keeping the blacks in their \"place.\" Sam's mother has recently been targeted by this group because she lectured at a black college, despite warnings that she should not. As a result they have become victims of the hatred spewing forth during this time towards the blacks and any who would support their cause. Sam has recently been given a camera by her mother's boyfriend, Perry, a photographer, and is being taught to look at what is there and to let the camera become an extension of her sight, and as she becomes better and better, she finds herself in situations of turmoil. This is a Vermont Dorothy Canfield Fisher nominee for 2011. A good addition to your collection of books on the Civil Rights movement, although there were times when the book became a bit slow."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2076871-kathy", "userReview": "I think not such a great book. Yet, I do appreciate Hutchins' journey to maturity. We read lots of correspondence between Hutchins and his family members and friends. Everybody else writes better than Hutchins does, yet he he plans on becoming a poet. I didn't care much for Ann's letter-writing, either. I liked all of the elders in the book. The Source of Light reminds me of A River Runs Through It, which I prefer."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2645519-julia", "userReview": "I liked the overall message this book sent: that people are all damaged in one way or another and that sometimes they should try to think how their actions will affect the others in their lives. But, kind of like life, it was a somewhat painful and confusing to wade through. I wasn't crazy about the way it was written, with no more than a page or two NOT broken into little chunks which always seemed to want to be heavy in their own rights, not just as a part of the whole."}, {"userName": "Marguerite", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1038238-marguerite", "userReview": "I didn't know this was part of a trilogy when I read it, and I intend to go back and read the books chronologically at some point, but this novel also manages to stand on its own fairly well. The characters are interesting and well-drawn. Price gets the North Carolina and Virginia cadences and places just right. Thanks to my friend Carolyn for introducing me to the author."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4931156-kate", "userReview": "Dark and disturbing in many places. Since Reynolds Price passed away this winter and was held in high esteem at Duke, I thought it time to read some of his books. I wonder if it is somewhat autobiographical since he studied at Merton in Oxford and was a NC native son. It certainly was not light reading and delves into characters thoughts and actions that deeply affect others."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1388274-michelle", "userReview": "Nowhere near as dynamic as the first book. The story lines that carried over from the first book stayed strong, but the new focus on the older youngest character was muddled and less than gripping. Even so, I'd have enjoyed it much more if I'd not had to skip 4 sections due to homosexual content."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5978646-alan", "userReview": "I had forgotten how much I like Reynolds Price's writing. Not much happens. A dying father, Hutchins Mayfield goes to study in Oxford, his relationship with Ann works or doesn't. The plot is not the important part. His writing is beautiful and poetic. It's well worth a slow, careful read."}, {"userName": "Michie O'day", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15924238-michie-o-day", "userReview": "One of the best novels I've ever read."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2582387-marvin", "userReview": "Very similar in character & style to its predecessor, The Surface of the Earth, except instead of spanning 3 generations, it focused on 10 months in the young (25) life of the third generation"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710557-amy", "userReview": "I caught this book in the wild, so that alone means it should at least be attempted (though this author and I don't have a good batting record.)"}], "description": "Here is the second volume of A Great Circle, the highly acclaimed Mayfield family trilogy, from one of America's literary treasures.  Though a novel independent from The Surface of Earth, The Source of Light continues the saga of the Mayfield family, here focusing on Hutchins Mayfield, whose desire for self-knowledge removes him from his secure existence as a prep school teacher and takes him on a journey to Oxford and Italy to study and write. Hutchins comes back home for a family crisis but ultimately returns to England, where he achieves a maturity that enables him to cope with commitments, abandonments, and the creation of an honest personal agenda.  In The Source of Light, Reynolds Price combines gravity and buoyancy, a mythic sense of the past with the mysteries of place, to forge an encompassing portrait of the strange and various world one travels through in the quest for self-fulfillment.", "title": "The Source of Light\n      \n          (The Mayfield Trilogy #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/270207.The_Source_of_Light", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347977626l/270207.jpg", "reviews": 12, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8167.Reynolds_Price", "name": "Reynolds Price"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/270207.The_Source_of_Light", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2770304-the-source-of-light", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13042.Kate_Vaiden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/270208.Roxanna_Slade", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32897.A_Long_and_Happy_Life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32892.A_Whole_New_Life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32899.The_Promise_of_Rest"]}
