In hours of reading. This brought to my mind another book that I absolutely loathed.Willow is the poor little girl that had to move to the middle of nowhere because her mommy (who is the only person that is remotely interesting in this whole damn book) burned some bridges after daddy cheated. Willow hates life. She hates the new school because girls are mean (Don't expect much here people..not much happens.) She makes friends with a local Apache teenager named Darryl. (Don't get your hopes up either..not enough on him either.)Anyways, she moves out to LA because you just know Willow is going to make it big time in the music business. She doesn't. Her mother is accidentally killed and she has to go and settle things so she can go back out to where she belongs.I hate myself for my stupid little thing of making a promise not to DNF a book this year, because this sucker would have gotten it. I felt like this character's dang therapist.And all I wanted to do is punch her in the face.There was nothing to read about (for me) other than this woman's self-centered bull crap.

I had never heard of her via my Goodreads friends or any Amazon recommendation or anything. The book caught my attention with its pretty cover. When I read the blurb I was intrigued. Now I can honestly say I\u2019ve been entranced and I really appreciated this book.This is a life story. Willow\u2019s story. You\u2019ll embark on a journey where important choices are made based upon lightning illuminating tainted-glass windows with messaged being delivered through animal shaped clouds and dreams. You\u2019ll make wishes written on kite in the hope of being heard by who or what is \u201cabove\u201d. It\u2019s a magic story filled with Indian\u2019s traditions. It\u2019s about finding a place to really belong. Making peace with the one you loved mourning them. One life is ending while a new one begins.Willow had to undertake this journey to find who she really is and what she wants in life. What makes her content, happy.Willow is at a turning point in her life. She\u2019s made mistakes and her dreams did not turn out as she had hoped. She\u2019s been dumped by her boyfriend the same day she heard her mother died. She\u2019s been living in Los Angeles for years now and will have to go back to the Reservation and organize her mother funeral. She should sell her mother\u2019s small vineyard. The one they planted together. Her mother\u2019s dream. Her life is in Los Angeles as a musician not in the middle of nowhere among goats, dogs, lama and bulls surrounded by vines. She should\u2026Returning to the farm Willow reconnects with old Indian friends. Darrel and his family, old teachers. It\u2019s a tight-knit community as Apaches believe in togetherness. The nature sings to her heart, resurrecting old dreams.Willow has been uprooted as a teen. Her parents divorced and her mother decided to follow her dream to live close to nature moving them from Washington State to the Apache Reservation in New Mexico. Willow\u2019s mom was \u201csomething else\u201d tenacious and resourceful. They would be self- sufficient on this small farm. They would grow their vegetables milk the goats, use solar panels and make wine. Willow was angry, so angry with her mother. She was nearly the only white people in her new school, bullied on her first day. All she\u2019s ever wanted was to belong. Really belong and it was not going to happen there. \u201dI wrote about the injustice of my situation, about how angry I was at my mom for essentially kidnapping me and taking me here and about Dad essentially abandoning me for a new-and-improved kid. I wrote about how much I hated standing out, hated being a blonde on an Indian reservation, about how I hated being poor, about how much I missed delicious food, and my friends, and my grandma, and the way things used to be.\u201dShe planned to escape and go live with her Grandma. But soon enough she\u2019ll meet Darrel. He will protect her welcome her in his family and become her best friend. Thanks to countless horse rides and the Vigil she\u2019ll come to learn her new home and blend in the surroundings. Another chance encounter with her future cello teacher will also help the young Willow to settle and let go of some of her anger.\u201cMost people can\u2019t or won\u2019t see me,\u201d I said. \u201cDad, Mom, almost everyone in my community, Ms. Nunnalee\u2014no one sees me. But you see me. And Darrel sees me. And the Vigils see me. I just don\u2019t want to be with people who can\u2019t or won\u2019t see me anymore.\u201d I felt so weary. Looking deep into my eyes, she said, \u201cI see you. I see you.\u201dBack and forth we go. Between teenage Willow and the woman she now has grown to be. This story is about growing up. Slowly, gradually we ease into Willow\u2019s skin, walk into her shoes and have to think about the choices she has to make. What does really matter? What is really important? Is it following the path she was on for years now and go back to Los Angeles without real friends? Or choose a new beginning and stay here in this welcoming community where she can read the clouds as if it\u2018s common occurrence because these people accept her as she is? Create her own music?The writing drew me in making me experience this beautiful if lonely land of the Cestero Apache Reservation. I could see the bear shaped clouds, smell the sage bushes, feel the earth and imagine Grandpa Vigil imparting his wisdom sharing his dreams. I really loved reading about the Indian traditions and customs. I found the Indian tradition of the Sacred Clown brilliant! The land sang to me as it sang to Willow. If you want a book filled with actions, fast paced and go full speed from one adventure to another one this is not your book. Things happen of course but at their own pace. It\u2019s a \u201cgourmet\u201d book, meant to be savored.My only complaint if you can even call it a complaint? I would have loved one more epilogue because I\u2019m a greedy reader. Some doors are closed. We can guess that some choices have been made but barely suggested. So much more is yet to come with countless possibilities. So here I was thinking I would have loved more but honestly it\u2019s the perfect choice for this story and the author\u2019s style.You want to follow all my reviews and rants?

In this novel, Ms. McLaren tells the story of a young girl Willow, who is torn from her home and uprooted to a farm in New Mexico where she knows no one. It is hot and dirty and it is in the middle of nowhere. And her mother doesn't seem to care that she has destroyed her daughter's life. Willow is bullied at school and wants to disappear, but she makes friends with a neighbor, Darrel, who lives on a bordering apache reservation and he takes Willow under his wing and protects her. Even though she has Darrel by her side, Willow longs for graduation day, when she can get away from her mom and this awful town. Fast Forward years later, when a single & pregnant Willow returns to the farm (now a winery), to tend to her mother's funeral and save the farm from financial ruin. In doing so, Willow discovers who she truly is and finds out what has been missing from her life all this time.

While back in New Mexico sorting out her mom\u2019s estate, Willow begins to think about her relationship with her mother while also figuring out what to do with the unexpected pregnancy and realising maybe the place she has been running away from for a long time is actually home after all.This was a really nice, relaxing book to read and I\u2019m really glad I picked it ip. I was immediately entranced by Willow\u2019s past with her mother - from the way her mom response to her marriage breakdown by roasting marshmallows over a burning mattress to her dragging Willow off to the middle of nowhere for a fresh start. I loved how eccentric her mom was and how normal Willow just wanted to be. I did find some of Willow\u2019s reactions to her mother a bit extreme from focusing on her mother\u2019s alcoholism for ruining her childhood and making it sound like her mom was a mean, angry, abusive drunk (which she wasn\u2019t but did seem to drink a bit too much) and then one point during the grape planting years when she had damaged hands and wanted to lie to a social services worker about her mom being abusive. I found that a bit strange.Willow herself was an odd enough character and I definitely warmed to the people in her life such as her mom, Darrel and Darrel\u2019s grandparents, rather than Willow herself. I kept forgetting she was 39 year olds as her life seemed so..unorganised for an almost middle-aged woman. She could hardly afford half her rent, seemed shaky in her job and didn\u2019t have great relationships with men or even any close friends in LA and it kept making me think she was in her 20s rather than late 30s (which, apparently, in my mind means people need to have it figured out).I loved the bits of Apache culture that were put into the book from Willow\u2019s occasional use of the language and then her inclusion in the culture and tradition of the tribe and how she was included in events on the reservation growing up. I loved how this book focused on family and how sometimes family can be all around you without you noticing and that people who aren\u2019t necessarily blood-related can also be as strong family members as those who are. I really enjoyed the ending of it and how Willow\u2019s spirit really seemed to settle and her new affinity with her land and her plans for the future that also included her cello dreams, just slightly new ones. I also liked how Willow\u2019s romance with Mark was hinted at with the clear attraction and spark between the two but nothing was really pushed and/or became inappropriate considering she was newly pregnant with her ex. Overall, really enjoyed this book. It was a comforting read and I definitely recommend it."}, {"userName": "Dorine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6942470-dorine", "userReview": "Coming of age reflection mixes with picking up the pieces after loss in THE ROAD TO ENCHANTMENT by Kaya McLaren, one woman\u2019s growth through a broken childhood to become a healed, well-balanced adult. I loved the isolated setting near an Apache reservation, full of self-reliance ingenuity, which encourages Native American neighbors into action when Willow needs it.Willow\u2019s childhood was never normal which reflects her mother\u2019s personality and alcohol addiction. Mom sets a mattress on fire and roasts \u201cmarshmallow peeps\u201d over it when she finds out her husband cheated. Then she moves them to an off-the-grid farm on the edge of an Apache reservation in New Mexico. Willow\u2019s only way out is music when she learns to play the cello and becomes a studio artist in Los Angeles.Willow\u2019s adult world seems perfect. She lives with fellow recording artist, Ian, and they have a good life playing music for a living. But Ian suddenly feels the call to become a starving rock star, moves into his buddy\u2019s closet to save money and plays in a band. Willow is left wondering who will pay Ian\u2019s half of the rent. Then her mother dies, leaving Willow the ranch in New Mexico along with her debts to decipher. Willow packs her bags and moves home. To top all that off, she discovers she\u2019s pregnant with Ian\u2019s child.Who will save the day? Her not-so-stereotypical gay best friend Darrel, who is Apache, wants to help. His parents are very supportive and treat her as their daughter. Can Willow find her way back to music and happiness when everything she knows is gone?The quirky characters in this novel kept me entertained with their antics and solutions to Willow\u2019s dilemmas. Darrel\u2019s parents become support for Willow, encouraging her to be herself and to be brave. Darrel is a good best friend who has Willow\u2019s best interests in mind, even though he struggles with his own love life. I absolutely loved the animals. They added stress, emotion and interest to Willow\u2019s already complicated situation.By halfway through the novel, I had cried twice for Willow\u2019s situation. My emotion surprised me but her dilemma moved me. I wasn\u2019t sure Willow would choose the right path, but when she does, everything falls into place as it should, creating a pathway she begins to accept.There were a couple things that would have made the novel more enjoyable. First, Willow\u2019s love interest is introduced, toyed with for a bit, but then he\u2019s glossed over. I think more time should have been spent nurturing that relationship. I was satisfied with the end of the book, but because it had deep emotional impact early on, the oomph was taken out of the final chapters without more in-depth focus on her future.It\u2019s a lovely story so I wasn\u2019t disappointed. I just didn\u2019t feel the power behind the resolution as much as I had felt the emotion of the middle. That made it feel like the book climaxed too early and then lingered toward the end. It needs another emotive hook that is more prevailing than the middle to give it that wow factor I expected because the book was so great overall.My enjoyment was consistent with the quality of the writing and the characters I had come to love. I was encouraged by Willow\u2019s personal growth and found that very satisfying. A good coming of age reflection mixed with women\u2019s fiction, THE ROAD TO ENCHANTMENT is perfect for lovers of off-the-grid ingenuity mixed with the magic of the music business. The two worlds collide, revealing the beauty of a simple life.Review by Dorine, courtesy of The Zest Quest.

There was something magical in this book, maybe it was the setting, the fascinating character, the music or the mix of it all. It was the story of self re-discovery, of understanding and learning from the past and of strong ties with places and persons.It was a great journey i had with this book, i felt transported to this unique atmosphere in New Mexico, close by an Apache reservation, in the Winery and Goat Ranch that Willow's mother bought and worked hard on it. The place that Willow wanted to escape when she was growing up, that represented everything she hated. The same place she had to face when she came back 20 years later to bury her mother and get rid of it for ever.Only, things are never that simple.I can't exactly say what really touched my heart in this story, but it definitely caught me. The fact that it was told by Willow helped with that, the author did a great job in painting her fears, hopes, thoughts and decisions.

Having moved back to the home she and her mother lived in, Willow must find a way to pay off her mother's debts and decide what to do with the baby.The solutions to these problems are actually very simple. Willow sells the wine her mom has been making, and the animals on the farm, and solves the debt problem (more-or-less). The community rallies around her and manages to dissolve her already hesitant decision to abort the baby. The biggest question is whether she will go back to where she was, or stay in New Mexico (and it's pretty obvious to the reader which it is, even if it's not to Willow).To me, the beauty in this book are the characters and the gradually merging of past and present. First, the characters. The place in New Mexico where Willow grew up borders an Apache reservation and the community is almost all Apache. I really loved how that became part of the story - how the customs and language and people became a part of her life, even if she didn't initially feel like she belonged.And speaking of characters, both Willow's mom and dad were flawed people. I probably sympathised more with her dad than mom, despite the fact that it would normally be the other way round because I so acutely felt the embarrassment that Willow's mom caused her. Her dad, on the other hand, was largely absent (because her mom moved her to New Mexico) so my impression of him wasn't so bad.The second: Willow's acceptance of her past. The book alternates between the present day and Willow's memories, and it quickly begins to be clear that how Willow saw and experienced the world back then still affects her. So when she can finally accept her past, her present can start moving into the future.The only thing that I didn't like about the ending (mild spoilers ahead! Although to be honest there isn't much plot to spoil) is that Willow still ends up with a man in her life. A better man, to be granted, but for a good portion of the book, I thought this would be about the non-romantic type of love and how it can support people. To end with Willow in a relationship seemed to say that in the end, women need a man to be happy.Apart from that one (fairly large to me) point, I enjoyed this book. Willow's journey isn't dramatic, but she does make a journey and I dare say that she's happier at the end of it.Disclaimer: I got a free copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for a free and honest review.

This book is a love story between a mom and a daughter. Its a story about forgiveness, acceptance, and learning that love can have warts and beauty at the same time.

In many ways, this story was very sad. Willow's mother having been an alcoholic before passing and Willow feeling so alone being the only Caucasian in a predominantly Apache school. Even Willow's father can't be of any help as he decided to have an affair and take a second family where Willow feels like the third wheel. There were quite a few happy parts in this book, too. Willow had a wonderful brotherly relationship with Darrel and his grandparents and had a wonderful passion for music and riding horses.

Willow's friendship with Darrel and his grandparents made life bearable growing up but as soon as she graduated from high school, she moved to Los Angeles to fulfill her dream of becoming a musician. Her relationship with her mom remains contentious and after a particularly unpleasant visit three years earlier, Willow has not returned to visit.

Returning to the DeVine Winery and Goat Ranch to settle her mom's affairs, Willow tries to make peace with her past while at the same time attempting to figure out what comes next after she discovers she is pregnant.Willow is quite introspective upon her return to the childhood she has yet to come to terms with. All these years later, she remains resentful of her mother's decision to start over in a new place. She cannot forgive her dad for \"replacing\" their family with a new wife and child. She is disdainful of her mom's dreams which left them scrambling to make ends meet. Willow hates everything the DeVine Winery and Goat Ranch represents yet as she sorts through her mother's belongings, she begins to understand her a little better. Even more surprising is her altered perspective of her childhood home and the effect this has on her desire to continue pursuing her own dream in the midst of all of the changes that lie ahead of her as she makes a decision about her unplanned pregnancy.While Willow is a likable and sympathetic character, she is also quite frustrating as she tries to decide her future. The answer is staring her right in the face all along, yet she continues to agonize over making the best choice for herself and her unborn child. She is a little self-absorbed and unforgiving initially but as she sorts through the detritus of her mom's life and her own past, she finally begins to see things from her mom's viewpoint. Willow stubbornly clings to the idea of returning to Los Angeles even as she acknowledges the problems she is facing if she follows through with her plans. Thankfully she finally begins to open her heart and mind to the possibility that resisting change might not be in her best interests. However, whether Willow can completely resolve her issues with her past in order to find happiness remains far from certain.Although a little slow-paced, The Road to Enchantment is an emotionally compelling journey of self-discovery. This character-driven story is set against the harsh but beautiful New Mexico landscape and Kaya McLaren beautifully incorporates intriguing aspects of Apache heritage into the storyline. An absolutely breathtaking story of coming to terms with a painful past and forging a new path when life takes an unexpected turn that I absolutely loved and highly recommend to fans of the genre."}, {"userName": "Paperback Paris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67779091-paperback-paris", "userReview": "Kaya McLaren's The Road to Enchantment is a moving novel about figuring out where you belong.When Willow was a young girl, she witnessed her mother set fire to her cheating husband's mattress and waited until the fire department came around to extinguish it. After that, the two of them moved away to New Mexico in hopes of starting a new life in an Apache reservation. Once they arrive, Willow's mother gets the idea to start her own winery and goat ranch, but, of course, as the new girl in town, she's bullied for being so different from others. \"I sat back on my knees, looked up at the front door of the home where my mother's absence felt so wrong, where it was finally real in a way it hadn't been until that very moment. Then overcome by weakness, I laid down on the gravel, rolled over, and looked up at the sky above. It was clear and blue with only one cloud in it--a large bear that floated in the southeast over the Vigil place. A bear. My old best friend, Darrel. The sky seemed to be telling me he was coming, and so I shut my eyes and waited.\" -excerpt from Kaya McLaren's The Road to Enchantment Jumping to present day: Willow is now living in Los Angeles as a studio musician, but all of a sudden she gets dumped by her boyfriend, is pregnant with his child, and her mother has died. The winery and goat ranch she inherited from her mother in New Mexico is all Willow has left. So when she returns to the ranch, she's surprised to see that her old friend, Darrel, and the rest of the ranching community; it feels as though this life was her calling all along. The community welcomes her warmly, and feel Willow, too, is where she belongs: home. But now, Willow has to figure out how she can continue her mother's legacy and juggle the responsibility of making this ranch a home fit for her baby.The way McLaren describes the ranch and New Mexico in so much detail I felt were the highlights of this novel. I have never been to a ranch, let alone New Mexico, but her use of syntax and vivid descriptors made it feel like I was there the entire time. I also loved Willow as a character; I loved how she embraced her mother's ranch after her passing despite whatever negative memories she might have associated with her homeland.In the end, Willow becomes a stronger woman for her decision, and honestly: she's become one of my favorite female protagonists. I would recommend The Road to Enchantment to anyone who loves a strong-willed character or those who love books about how people go about carrying on their family's legacy.\u2014Review provided by Contributor, Jessica DuffieldRead this and more over at Paperback Paris!"}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63713421-deborah", "userReview": "The Road to Enchantment by Kaya McLaren is a story of loss, reflection, forgiveness and personal growth. I received an advance copy of this book from Goodreads giveaway/St Martin\u2019s press in exchange of my honest review. Although this was a predictable story, I really enjoyed this book. It was an entertaining easy read and I definitely recommend it.It is a story about a 39 year old woman, Willow, who moves back to her mother's New Mexico home in order to handle her mother's last affairs after living as a musician in Los Angeles for her entire adulthood. After Willow\u2019s mom, who marched to the beat of her own drum, leaves her father, she buys a ranch in New Mexico, dragging young Willow along. Starting over near an Apache reservation in a very isolated location in New Mexico was not where Willow wanted to be, as well as be the only Caucasian in a predominantly Apache school. I appreciated that the author incorporated intriguing aspects of Apache heritage into the storyline. Her father isn\u2019t sympathetic, as he had an affair and started another family where Willow feels like the third wheel. Willow did have a brotherly relationship with Darrel and his grandparents and had a great passion for Apache heritage, music and riding horses. This made her life bearable growing up, but as soon as she graduated from high school, she moved to Los Angeles to fulfill her dream of becoming a musician.Willow never quite forgave her mom for upsetting her life after discovering her husband was cheating on her. This makes her mother's unexpected death even more painful since she was never quite able to repair the tension between them. Willow hated everything the winery and goat ranch represents, yet as she sorts through her mother's belongings to settle her mom\u2019s affairs, she begins to make peace with her past while at the same time attempting to figure out what comes next after she discovers she is pregnant. Revisiting the ranch allows her to reconsider her future. Willow finds that the influence of the small town life where everyone knows your business and where friends are like family, helps her realize that maybe this is where she needed to be at this point in her life. The place she has been running away from for a long time is actually home after all."}, {"userName": "Marta", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17265176-marta", "userReview": "I am a little burnt out on stories that go back and forth in time, but The Road to Enchantment uses this technique well to tell the story of a woman who bears the the scars of being taken as a child by her mom from a comfortable Washington suburban home and forced to live in rural hardship in New Mexico.Willow is now faced with the task of returning to their makeshift ranch to settle her mom's debts. Returning home, sorting objects, and deciding her next steps force her to revisit her past. Some memories are painful because her mom was being awful, but some are painful because they are sweet memories and cause her to feel confused and sad. I thought this novel was an excellent portrayal of what it is like to grow up under a parent whose on emotional landscape determines everything for her daughter from the mood of the day to major life decisions. How do you grieve a parent who traumatized you yet also loved you? How do you make peace with how this shapes your own adulthood? Really it was so well done, it made me wonder if any of it was personal experience because I think some of the scenes, feelings and dialogue would be hard to conjure up. They feel real. McLaren is a beautiful writer, who obviously has a love of essays as her chapters come together so neatly at the closing. At times, the perfect tying up of each chapter was a distraction for me-I wanted to have a break from the neatness of it all. The end had that same quality that half satisfied and half detracted from the experience.The Apache life and people portrayed in this book attracted me. It was a bonus to learn new ways of looking at community, death, even clouds. Willow's friendship with Bear is lovely and a sweet, needed contrast to her home life.This would be a good pick for a book discussion."}, {"userName": "Joanne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9105994-joanne", "userReview": "I received my copy of this novel from Goodreads in exchange for my review. This book left me with a warm feeling at the end. Yes, it was predictable but well written. The story revolves around Willow and the difficult choices she must make as she approaches her fortieth birthday. We see her life from two perspectives - as a child being forced to move to New Mexico with her mom; and as an adult reflecting on her past. She must reconcile her relationships with her mother and other family members to move forward. This was a \"good read\".

I thought the daughter Willow was a spoiled brat, and proved it many times throughout. Her mother was a hoot, an open minded free spirit. The story was predictable, but the characters delightful. I love all things New Mexico, and the setting for this story is in northern New Mexico which is beautiful and hard. Willow is nearly forty when she discovers her mother, and becomes a real daughter, but the close relationship develops because of her mother's death.

Thank you!"}], "description": "As a young girl, Willow watched her mother leave their home in Washington State in a literal blaze of glory: she set the mattress of her cheating husband on fire in her driveway, roasting marshmallow peeps and hot dogs before the fire department arrived. And with that, she and Willow set off to New Mexico, to a new life, to a world of arroyos and canyons bordering an Apache reservation. Willow was devastated. Her eccentric mother believed in this new life and set about starting a winery and goat ranch. But for Willow, it meant initially being bullied and feeling like an outsider. Today, as a grown woman, Willow much prefers Los Angeles and her job as a studio musician. But things tend to happen in threes: her mother dies, her boyfriend dumps her, and Willow discovers she is pregnant. The DeVine Winery and Goat Ranch is all she has left, even if it is in financial straits and unmanageable back taxes. There is something, though, about the call of \u201chome.\u201d She's surprised to find that her Apache best friend Darrel along with the rest of the community seems to think she belongs far more than she ever thought she did. Can Willow redefine what home means for her, and can she make a go of the legacy her mother left behind? Told with Kaya McLaren\u2019s humor and heart, The Road to Enchantment is a story about discovering that the last thing you want is sometimes the one thing you need.\u201cThis is a potent coming of true age novel. One that gently leads us to leave behind all we imagined as lost, encourages us to embrace what adventure of the simple day lies ahead. The Road to Enchantment carries us into that place beyond the dark hour where the power of story reigns, truth will not be denied, and all the magic of this life will be remembered.\u201d \u2013River Jordan", "title": "The Road to Enchantment", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32934698-the-road-to-enchantment", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1478746987l/32934698.jpg", "reviews": 90, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/357844.Kaya_McLaren", "name": "Kaya McLaren"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32934698-the-road-to-enchantment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833844-the-road-to-enchantment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939295-the-road-to-enchantment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538927-how-i-came-to-sparkle-again", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19286525-the-firelight-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/666622.On_the_Divinity_of_Second_Chances", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1138093.Church_of_the_Dog", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24838085-good-night-little-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
