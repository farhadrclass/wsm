Now that my daughter has finally stopped laughing at me, I can write this silly review that will probably be a lot longer than the actual story really is. I wasn't even going to write a review but we were laughing so hard at this that I felt compelled to do so.This literally is 100 words (well, I didn't actually count the words, but it really is that short.) I kept pressing the down arrow trying to read more and my daughter started laughing at me and finally had to tell me to stop. \"Mom, stop! That's it. That's the end of the story.\" What, what do you mean!? Where's the rest of it? As soon as I realized that that really was all we both busted out laughing.Not sure why this would go on here or why it had such high reviews.
