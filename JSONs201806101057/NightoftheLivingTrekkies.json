It met or exceeded expectations in terms of both writing (crisp, polished and very funny) and characters (genuine, endearing, and smart), and the narrative was slick, fast paced and well laid out (i.e., twas nary a boring page). In fact, the overall quality was so surprisingly high that it made me wonder why this book isn\u2019t better known, especially given its popular ingredients. Speaking of those ingredients, this is where Kevin David Anderson\u2019s novel truly shines. The Star Trek/SF culture references are well-devised, laid on molasses-thick and deployed with a real sense of comedic timing. And the Zombie mythology is fresh and clever and adds a degree of substance that sets this apart from your run of the mill gimmick book. Even the end, where so many novels like this lose focus or run out of gas, was well handled. I left this story thinking I would pick up Mr. Anderson\u2019s next effort sight unseen. Anyway...here\u2019s the set up...PLOT SUMMARY:An \u201cincident\u201d takes place at a top secret government research facility, unleashing a zombie plague all over downtown Houston. By virtue of a series of later explained occurrences, the epicenter of the infection turns out to be a massive Trek convention full of the hardest of hardcore trekkies. Despite the hokey, groan-worthy nature of this set up, Anderson does a nice job pulling it off.Caught in the turbulence is Jim Pike (yes, Trek buffs, Jim....Pike), former unit commander in the famous 10th Mountain Division, whose carrying some heavy baggage from his tour in Afghanistan. When the fit hits the shan, Jim, along with a small cadre of in costumed conventioneers must fight their way through a horde of growing starfleet zombies. \nTHOUGHTS:I thought it was terrific. I enjoyed the way that Anderson allowed the plague to slowly develop, giving us time to get to know the characters, and setting up a scenario that, while still fantastic, didn\u2019t offend the suspension of disbelief. It was these touches of competence that started to clue me in that Anderson has the story telling gift. Okay, now let\u2019s break down the fun... If you\u2019re a Trekkie/Trekker...This story will stroke all your sweet spots and give you a shuttering nerdgasm. In addition to actually describing the difference between \u201ctrekkie\u201d and \u201ctrekker,\u201d something I have always been fuzzy about, here are just a few of the highlights:1. Every chapter heading is the name of a different Star Trek episode (e.g., \"Space Seed\", \"Let That Be Your Final Battlefield\", \"Wolf in the Fold\", \"Dagger of the Mind\", etc.), and the title used has some relation to that chapter\u2019s subject matter. This is not as easy as it may sound, and I thought it was another one of those nice touches that Anderson used.2. Trek references, trivia, and dialogue positively abound throughout the novel and will satisfy even the most severe trekophile. From iconic tidbits recognizable by even the most casual of fans (e.g., the title sequence of the show is put to good use) to obscure nuggets that will convince the hard core that the author knows his stuff (e.g., remember the lirpa from the episode Amok Time, or the creature known as a Horta from Devil in the Dark....if not, you should). These references litter almost every scene. It\u2019s like a Trekkie brain shagging 3. A group known as the West Texas Red Tunic Club, who all dress as red shirts from the original series. What happens to them, and any fan of the show can guess their fate, is hysterical. \n4. One of the characters is a giant metal shop worker who came to the convention dressed as Klingon officer named Martock. Martock\u2019s side business is making real life, and real deadly, replicas of all of the various Star Trek blade weapons. From the afore-mentioned lirpa to Klingon bat\u2019leths to kar\u2019takins used by the Jem\u2019Hadar. 5. One of the characters, seemingly unintentionally, is constantly quoting lines from the original Star Wars trilogy at exactly the right time. To add to the comedy, she does this while dressed, for most of the novel, in Princess Leia\u2019s slave bikini...why is a very funny story. \nIf you are a Zombie fan...This is another place where the book elevates itself, from what could have been just a fun bout of Star Trek masturbation, into a really terrific effort. I don\u2019t want to give anything away regarding the nature of the dead heads because the solving of that mystery is at the heart of the novel. However, while the zombies display the characteristically slow, awkward ambulation and a taste for skull candy that are common to the genre, most everything else about them is fresh and unique. Their background is unusual, and there is a motivation and purpose to the \u201cattacks\u201d that is far different and more understandable than the mindless search for \u201cbraaaaaaaains.\u201d These zombies are much more sophisticated. \nPlus, they have and \u201ceye-popping\u201d addition that allows them to be far more organized and uniform in their activities...almost \u201cBorg-like\u201d you might say. If you\u2019re both a Star Trek AND a Zombie fan...If this is the case, you probably stopped reading this review after the first 3 words, and speed-typed your way online to download a copy onto your kindle...so I\u2019m not going to waste my breath on you, except to say that leaving like that was rather rude. And...finally...If you hate both Star Trek and Zombies...I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You obviously have made some wrong decisions in your life that have led you to this unfortunate circumstance. Maybe you should go and take a long hard look at yourself in the mirror and figure out where things began to fall apart. It\u2019s not too late...the first step is admitting you have a problem. ADDED BONUS:If everything else above wasn\u2019t enough, Anderson also ties into the story a government conspiracy involving scientific black ops, alien visitations and even a tactical nuke. Bonus.So, it\u2019s a mash made in heaven for fans of trek and zombies...\nEnjoy4.0 stars.

And instead of making a parody tv series of Star Trek, the author made direct references of Star Trek, along with some other sci-fi series.Also, the fun of geeky comments didn't affect that the menace of the zombies is truly deadly and real. So, it's also a terrific zombie novel. However, if you want to enjoy the book as much as me, I have to mention that you will need a good knowledge of the entire Star Trek franchise, along with a fair knowledge of the original trilogy of Star Wars and a basic knowledge of popular sci-fi series like Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Doctor Who, etc... Also, it wouldn't hurt if you have watched films like Dawn of the Dead (the newer one), and other similar zombie films.So, you have to be a Trekkie with general knowledge of sci-fi series and enjoying zombie films, to embrace the full impact of this amusing novel.If you checked those requirements... welcome aboard! You will enjoy a very good zombie novel with priceless references and comments about Star Trek and other pop sci-fi stuff. The author named each chapter on the book with titles of episodes of Star Trek, not only the original series but also all the TV spin-offs and even a movie title. Also, I think that characters in the novel were created in a precise way. The main character, Jim Pike, he used to be a Trekkie but after some gruesome experiences in Afghanistan, he stopped to believe in the bright future that Star Trek conceived. He is not only the main character but his military knowledge is crucial to the surviving of the group.You will have too, \"Leia\" (yes, you read right), mysterious pro cosplay model of conventions, with a priceless attire of Return of the Jedi slave outfit combined with Star Trek slippers with the shape of \"Starship Enterprise\" (only for that, you have to love this book!!!).This odd couple will face danger while leading a bunch of Trekkies trying to survive a perilous journey through a hotel infested with zombies.And yes, you can bet that there will be a Red Shirt wearing guy too ;) And don't be mistaken, in the middle of all this fun, you will get a smart novel presenting a very good zombie story.I don't go around giving away 5-star ratings, so, honestly I think that this novel deserves this score, since I enjoy each page of the book and not only fulfill my expectations but it exceeded in big way.It's the Star Trek novel that you can't believe it's not part of the Star Trek line of books."}, {"userName": "Nenia \u2728 Queen of Literary Trash, Protector of Out-of-Print Gems, Khaleesi of Bodice Rippers, Mother of Smut, the Unrepentant, Breaker of Convention \u2728 Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190064-nenia-queen-of-literary-trash-protector-of-out-of-print-gems-khalees", "userReview": "Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestQuirk Books is my go-to for fun, quirky reads. They specialize in books that pay homage to or satirize pop-culture, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING TREKKIES is no exception. First, let's take a moment to appreciate the frak out of that cover. The artist totally nailed the 1960s pulp look (trust me, I would know: I read them). The book is just as good. NIGHT OF THE LIVING TREKKIES is a gory celebration of comic book/sci-fi conventions, Star Trek, Star Wars, zombie movies and books (specifically The Walking Dead and Dawn of the Dead), and horror movie cliches.Jim is a veteran from the Afghanistan war and it messed him up. He used to be big into Star Trek, but after serving in a real war he lost interest in watching fake ones, even if they're set in space. But he's reunited with his long lost love when the hotel he works at ends up becoming the venue for GulfCon, a Star Trek convention.Pretty soon, things start to go wrong in a bad way. People getting hurt or sick and a series of mysterious no-call, no-shows and outright disappearances. There's also a bunch of creepy people huddled in the alley outside the hotel who don't look like your typical homeless people. That's because they aren't. They're zombies - but of course, this being an homage to Star Trek, they aren't going to be your typical zombies, oh my no. How pedestrian.NIGHT OF THE LIVING TREKKIES kind of reminded me of Scott Sigler's INFECTED (only better written and without all the shock horror and gore). The zombies and their transformation were truly terrifying, and even though I don't like zombie films or books typically, I really appreciated the survival element in this book, as Jim and his new friends navigate the hotel and try to figure out what's causing the outbreak as well as how to survive. The Star Wars references were also hilarious.If you enjoy any of the things that I mentioned in the opening paragraph of this review (Star Wars, Star Trek, zombies, etc.), I think you'll enjoy NIGHT OF THE LIVING TREKKIES. It's been a while since I had so much fun being scared.3.5 to 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "What can one expect from a book called Night of the Living Trekkies?1.

I didn't expect to love it. And I did. It started to drag for about two chapters at the end, but even that couldn't wipe away the brilliance of Night of the Living Trekkies. I don't know that people will like this book if they aren't fans of at least Zombies or Trek, but if you're a fan of both this book is a photon torpedo. It's slick, action-packed, wittingly hits all the right notes and plays by the rules of its sources, and it is ready, this minute, to be turned into an excellent film. I hope it makes it to the big screen, but even if it doesn't, I'll be returning to Houston and the problem of Third Eye Space Zombies real soon.

I'm a Star Trek fan and I liked zombies before the concept was run into the ground so this promised to be some brain-chomping good fun.And it was. There are plenty of Star Trek references for the Trekkers and lots of zombie goodness for the fans of the reanimated. When you've got Klingons, a woman dressed like Princess Leia in the bikini from Return of the Jedi, and a red shirt named Willy Makit, you can't help but have a good time. While the Star Trek piece supplies the humor of the book, it doesn't go to a ridiculous level and the zombies still feel like a viable threat.Jim Pike, a veteran of Afghanistan, denies the depths of his Star Trek fandom until it counts, and he steps into his Captain's tunic admirably. The book wound up feeling like Die Hard with zombies more than anything else.Night of the Living Trekkies is a fun diversionary read. 3.5 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "This was fun.\nJim Pike was deployed to Afghanistan two times and lost several members of his squad when he happened to be in the hospital for a bleeding ulcer during an ambush. Ever since then, he's felt responsible for their deaths. As a civilian, he's chosen \"safe\" and easy jobs so he doesn't have to worry about letting anyone down. When the story begins, he's a bellhop/newly promoted assistant manager at a two-star hotel where a Star Trek convention is about to take place.Little does anyone know, a zombie outbreak is about to go down - right at the hotel - threatening the lives of millions of Texas citizens and possibly the entire planet.

I really enjoyed it. Star Trek and zombies are an awesome combination. It's practically impossible to go wrong with that formula and this did not disappoint.At one point, the small band of survivors are planning their next move and the conversation goes something like this:\u201cWhat initially attracted you to Star Trek?\u201d\u201cI thought Patrick Stewart was hot,\u201d Rayna said.\"Fair enough.

Hang on to your Spock-ears...this is going to be a convention to remember!Jim's two tours of duty in Afghanistan have left him wary and alert, traits that may just save his life when the convention he's working goes pear shaped. Hundreds of Trekkies have converged on GulfCon. Now, thousands of zombies will converge on them. And believe me, zombies are WAY more troublesome than tribbles!This is fairly standard zombie fare - a small group of survivors, holed up inside a shopping mall hotel/convention center, surrounded by hungry hordes who want to eat their entrails.The Star Trek references and inside jokes make this one fun and nudge it slightly ahead of the run-of-the-mill living-dead pack.

I was pleasantly surprised. Although most of the story is tongue in cheek until it grows more and more serious towards the end, the main characters are well developed and even small walk-on parts are sympathetic and convincing, and the action is well described and smoothly written. The set-up for the story is that Jim Pike (yes, a cross between two of the iconic captains of Classic Trek) is newly promoted to assistant manager of The Botany Bay, a Houston hotel which is hosting a Trekkie/Trekker convention (the book helpfully spells out the difference at one point). The snag is, Jim has spent most of his working life since leaving the Army - where he underwent two tours of Afghanistan and still suffers PTSD-related issues - avoiding responsibility. But it lands well and truly in his lap when he starts to become concerned about a spate of disappearances of hotel staff and guests as the convention begins on Friday night, possibly connected with the bites a couple have suffered: bites which mysteriously continue to bleed. If that isn't enough, his younger sister, for whom he feels responsible since the deaths of their parents, is due to arrive as a convention attendee .....The story is an enjoyable page turner. Jim and the main female character, a woman dressed as Princess Leia of Star Wars for a promotional video to help pay her way into medical school, are both engaging. As the odds against them stacked up, I wondered if they would survive long enough for their kindling romance to develop, or for Jim and the reader to find out her real name. There is an undercurrent of humour through most of the tale and clever asides to Star Trek, with for example, each chapter being named after an episode. And even the rationale behind the zombie outbreak is well thought-out with an unusual twist. So a well deserved 5-star rating from me."}, {"userName": "Sarah Mac", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4490376-sarah-mac", "userReview": "This is an extremely silly book...but isn't that the point? :DThe blurb says it all. Our hero is Jim Pike (yes, Trekkies -- that's his real name) & he's a young army vet suffering from PTSD after two disastrous tours in Afghanistan. His newest job is glorified bellhop at a Houston convention center named the Botany Bay (yes, Trekkies -- THAT Botany Bay), which is currently playing host to a weekend Star Trek geekfest.

There's an oddly high number of bitten hotel employees, & conventioneers are disappearing whenever they head out back for a smoke. Jim tries to dismiss his paranoia, but soon he's confronted with the ugly truth: bitten employees & guests are turning into undead cannibals, & it's all courtesy of a government space program gone horribly wrong. Now Jim & a small band of survivors -- including an overly-sensitive Klingon, a doomed Red Shirt ensign, & a misplaced Princess Leia clone (yes, she's in the wrong hotel) -- are fighting to escape the Botany Bay before Houston is nuked for the good of the world.Clearly this isn't a Serious Book. It's a gory love letter to sci-fi geeks, especially Trekkies (mostly TOS & TNG, which is good because I never got into Voyager or DS9), & as such contains episodic-appropriate, neatly-contained emotions. There were plenty of in-jokes & gentle mockery of all the series; some jokes were overt & others more subtle, such as this one:The GulfCon organizers had prepared an entire playlist that was tailored exclusively to Trekkie conventioneers; there were pop songs covered by Leonard Nimoy, film scores by Jerry Goldsmith, and the occasional warbling song of a humpback whale....Yes, I LOL'd at that. (What can I say? One of the earliest distinct memories from my theatre-going childhood is Star Trek IV.) But despite (or because of?) the Trek humor, it does touch (very) lightly upon one issue that's heavily explored in serious zombie offerings like George Romero movies & The Walking Dead: i.e., people don't stop needing leadership & comfort even if you wish they'd look somewhere else.A quick, enjoyable read that made me giggle.

Earlier this year, we got \"Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter,\" a funny take on the historical biography that asked what if Honest Abe was really a vampire slayer? On the other end of the spectrum is the Hugo-nominated zombie/steampunk novel \"Boneshaker.\"And then, somewhere in the middle is the mash-up, \"Night of the Living Trekkies.\" The story is a satire, bringing the horror of the zombie apocalypse to a \"Star Trek\" convention.\"Trekkies\" is a clever satire that works well enough in small gulps. Each chapter title is cleverly taken from the title of an episode of \"Star Trek,\" and each chapter is packed with in-jokes and one-liners for fans of each generation of \"Star Trek.\"The story finds Jim Pike, a former special forces soldier who quit the military after stints in Iraq, working at small hotel that is hosting the local \"Star Trek\" con. After Iraq, Jim wanted a quiet job where he wouldn't have to think too much and working at the hotel seems to fit the bill. However, as the con gets up and running, Jim finds that things are slowly getting more and more bizarre, leading up to the discovery that zombie are attacking the hotel. Jim becomes the reluctant leader of a small group of survivors who work their way through the hotel, trying not to become zombies themselves and to escape.One of the big problems with satirical genre stories is the author or authors try too hard to emulate the style of two of the greats in the field--Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett. Both men make being funny, satirical and witty look easy as you read it, but anyone who's tried to emulate their style knows it's not easy to do. \"Trekkies\" isn't in the same stratosphere of an Adams or Pratchett story, but authors Kevin David Anderson, and Sam Stall are able to keep the jokes coming at a reasonable pace and to have the story keep moving. My big fear picking up the novel was that it could become like an \"SNL\" skit and overstay its welcome. And while the story, as a whole, loses a bit of momentum from the time we figure out zombies are attacking the con and our team of heroes getting together to try and escape, the story and jokes never go hopelessly off the rails.Reading \"Trekkies,\" I kept having flashbacks to Sharon McCrumb's two classic murder-at-genre-convention novels, \"Bimbos of the Death Sun\" and \"Zombies of the Gene Pool.\" And while \"Trekkies\" isn't quite as entertaining as those two novels, it's still a fun little read. It's a far more specific genre satire than either of McCrumb's novels.If you love and know your \"Trek,\" there are a wealth of in-jokes and fun to be had here. The novel may not be as clever as some of the other zombie mash-ups, but it's still a fun read and well worth picking up if you like zombies and you like \"Star Trek.\""}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "I just finished this one and while it's a bit of a mixed bag (seems to be a phrase I use a lot lately) on the whole (as is that one) this is a thoroughly enjoyable book. This is a sort of cross genre parody seriocomic tale of the zombie apocalypse...at a Star Trek convention. There are places where the novel touches on many, many...many books and movies that you almost undoubtedly have seen and read. The best part of the book in my opinion was/is the parody. The cliches from zombie, science fiction and horror genres had me laughing out loud on several occasions: \"I just realized people have been going out front all evening....and none of them have come back!\" \"Okay, I'll go out front and have a look.\"With jokes and cliches from Star Trek as well as every zombie apocalypse movie and book out there (not to mention a few miscellaneous lines and cliches from Star Wars and other sources) it works well. What worked less well for me were a few of the attempts at \"real world\" parts on \"significant topics\". Jim (that's Jim Pike for all us nerds) and his periods of \"woe is me I got my men killed so now I should die\" episodes wore thin quick. I think the book might have been better had the writer simply written for the laughs and not tried to use that plot line. Just me I thought the angst from Jim and Leia (no I didn't get that wrong) just slowed things down.So, as I said overall a good and enjoyable read. Lot's of imagination, good story line nice little twist...all in all I like it and recommend it hardily for a few laughs. I know I was in need of some."}, {"userName": "Sarenna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1512721-sarenna", "userReview": "This book was a lot of fun. The geek in me loved the idea of a zombie outbreak at a Star Trek convention. I'm not a Trekkie by any stretch of the imagination, but I love the Star Trek movies and the original series. How can you not love Captain Kirk, Spock, Scotty and Lt. Uhura? And, of course, Mr. Sulu (George Takei is just awesome). But I digress. This was a fast, fun read. It had the right amount of cheese, gore, one-liners and general geekiness to make this sci-fi nerd happy. I probably would have given it a full 5 stars for the cheese and fun factor, but there were some fact checking issues that knocked it down to a 4. This is my pet peeve, I know this. A simple google search would have corrected these mistakes. And that's what irritates me. If an author isn't sure about something, look it up, or just leave it out. Especially if it's not integral to the plotline.Again, clips are not magazines and magazines are not clips. Glock firearms do not have an external safety that you flip or click or switch. You also do not have to feed a round after you fire the weapon if there is still ammo in the magazine. Unless there's a stove-pipe, or a misfire of some kind. For folks that aren't as picky about details like that as I am, details like this probably don't matter. If you're looking for a quick, fun, geeky read, definitely give this a try. Lots of fun, even if the research left something to be desired."}, {"userName": "Elisa ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5133558-elisa", "userReview": "Silly, gross, twisted good fun.

So when somebody writes a book about a zombie outbreak at a Star Trek convention, my only response has to be, \"Shut up and take my money.\" Here's the thing: Night of the Living Trekkies works equally well as an affectionate parody of Trekkies/Trekkers and as a zombie book. Seriously. The zombies are frightening, gruesome, and even have an original touch. (Alien parasites! How very Trek.) There's good action, with fantastic Trek weapons. (Who doesn't want to decapitate a zombie with a lirpa? Besides people who don't know what a lirpa is, of course. Hint: You want to decapitate a zombie with one.) Anderson is very affectionate in his portrayal of Trekkies (he must be One of Us) in a Galaxy Quest sort of way, which makes for an especially fun read for a Trekker.Most of all, there are developed characters here that are easy to care about and get invested in. Jim Pike (what a fabulous name!) is our viewpoint character, and he's interesting, believable, and somebody that I really liked by the end of the book. The supporting cast is varied, fun to read about, and a realistic spread of characters that might be at a Star Trek convention. In a way, Night of the Living Trekkies reminded me of Shaun of the Dead. There's that same balance of humor and credible zombie action. When Jim stumbles across a group of zombies feeding on the brains of a fallen conventioneer, it's grotesque and creepy, as it should be. But when you realize that the corpse is dressed as Spock and the zombies were dressed as the brain thieves from Spock's Brain, it's also hilarious. I think that one scene is a perfect description of everything that the book does, and does well."}, {"userName": "Mary JL", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1734736-mary-jl", "userReview": "I thought this would be a spoof all the way through. I was plesantly surprised to find it much better written than I had expected. Not an award winner---but definitely worth reading once.The slow build-up of how Jim Pike pulls a diverse group of fans together to survive is well done. I liked the ending. And I do not want to say much because I do not want to spoil things for readers.It starts a little slow, but I recommend keep reading for a bit. I thought it improved as it went along. It is defintely a bit 'different' than some Star Trek novels, but I enjoyed that difference.Btw, not recommended for real young Trek fans as the violence level--particularly descriptions of zombie destructions--is a little high.Recommended for Star Trek fans; those who have attended any Sf convention; and any Sf reader looking for something a bit different."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky", "userReview": "You cannot fault a book that does exactly what it says it will.

It is a zombie story set at a Star Trek convention, which is an interesting mix. It felt a little bit like the authors were like, \"Hey! What if we write a book about my favorite thing and your favorite thing!?\" Bam! Zombies meet Star Trek. That said, neither element was terribly developed. I am not a huge Star Trek fan and given the choice between meeting Mark Hamill and William Shatner, I'd choose Mark Hamill just about every day. Although, I bet William Shatner would be a hoot and a half to meet. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the deeply committed Star Trek nerd elements of the story, even if I couldn't relate. My favorite bits were Leia's (un?)intentional Star Wars quotes, though. Those I thoroughly appreciated. The zombies were okay. I'm also not a big zombie fan. These were pretty run of the mill. Well, except for the that one thing, but, while it was a valiant attempt at adding their own ideas to zombie lore, there wasn't much to it. And the Big Bad was...underwhelming. There were some fun characters, even though none of them were developed and they all felt a bit cookie-cutter. The disillusioned hero and his sister (who really serves nearly exclusively as a motivational tool for the main character). There's the douche-bag, the uber-nerd, the hot-girl-geek, the con vendor (a true geek as well as a talent who makes money off fans), and a Red Shirt. Can't have a Star Trek homage without a Red Shirt.It is a pretty easy read and the chapters fall into one another nicely. They're short, but easily lure you from one to another. Reading went quickly for me, until I did not finish it in time for book club. After which I did not have any strong desire to pick it back up again. But, in cleaning up my book lists, I picked it up again and finished the other half in the span of a couple hours.If you like zombies and Star Trek, THIS IS YOUR BOOK. If you like either, but not both, or are just a general nerd-culture aficionado, it'll probably feel like a 3-star read to you.

Stephen's review put it squarely back in the middle of my radar. To be fair, Stephen's reviews are always good reading, but this one was so darned enthusiastic that I paid extra attention.If you hate both Star Trek and Zombies...I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You obviously have made some wrong decisions in your life that have led you to this unfortunate circumstance. Maybe you should go and take a long hard look at yourself in the mirror and figure out where things began to fall apart. It\u2019s not too late...the first step is admitting you have a problem. At about 5 bucks on Amazon (and me with Amazon Prime) it was a no-brainer (yes, that was intentional).A quick litmus test is if you smile upon reading Jim Pike's name. Which I suspect anyone picking up this book did. You don't have to get every reference, but the more you understand the more enjoyable the book will be. It spans the gamut of Star Trek movies and series (and as a Deep Space Nine fan, I appreciate that).Super-quick summary: Jim Pike felt he failed as a leader of men in Afghanistan. Retreating to a hotel security position at home, he finds himself facing first a Star Trek convention and then a zombie apocalypse. As a Trek fan, he's able to tread water. As a horror fan, he's on less solid ground when it turns out that zombies actually do exist. As someone eschewing any responsibility, he's in full retreat when people keep turning to him for leadership in combat situations.Best of all, however, is that this is a true horror novel. Salted with Trek references and turning on several necessary Trek points, nonetheless you don't need to be a Trekkie (or Trekker) to enjoy the book. I admit it definitely will help, but the authors make it worthwhile with their fresh take on the zombie genre while maintaining solid ties to both Trek and Star Wars worlds. It's a survival story, it's an apocalypse story, it's an \"us against the world\" story, it's a geek story, and there's even a bit of a mystery thrown in. A deeper litmus test is this which should make you laugh aloud and then want to read it aloud to someone.\"Have you been able to reach the outside world?\"\"I've tried, but so far, no dice. Nothing but snow on the TV. Phones are toast. And no Internet, which is really strange. It was originally designed to serve as a fail-safe communications mode during a nuclear war, so it's very, very resilient. To lock it down this tight, you'd have to have someone very smart and powerful actively denying service.\"\"Or maybe it's gone,\" Jim said.For a moment the line was silent.\"What?\" Gary finally said. \"What do you mean?\"\"Maybe it doesn't exist anymore. Maybe it suffered some sort of catastrophic, worldwide failure.\"\"Oh, no,\" Gary said with disturbingly brittle finality. \"That's not possible. Somebody's keeping us from getting to the Internet, but the Internet is still there. It will always be there.\"Jim decided to back off. ...Night of the Living Trekkies is a light, summer read and one that I will be saving on my \"stress rereading\" shelf for an enjoyable adventure in a world where no man has gone before."}, {"userName": "Gregory", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2154083-gregory", "userReview": "Take a large Star Trek convention in a big Texas city and add a zombie apocalypse to it along with some delightful characters and you've got a really enjoyable read. The Star Trek (and some Star Wars) references here were thick and fun. It contains a bit of graphic horror but I don't think it's enough to turn most weak stomachs off. All the chapters were named after well known Star Trek episodes. The final couple of concluding chapters were very well done and wrapped up the story quite nicely. You get to know the main characters and pull for them as they fight for their lives against the hoard of zombies throughout their convention hotel. Some of the dialogue and situations in this book are laugh out loud funny and can even bring you to tears. This book is good medicine for any Star Trek fan feeling the blues.
