The food, the crops, lung diseases, animals dead or dying and finally killing the hopes of many of these tough, hardworking people. Most left their farms of many years, heading to the migrant camps in the West. I have read non fiction books, seen the PBS documentary but for me this book made a huge impact.I think it was because we get to know some of these families. Their pride, their hopes, just trying to get a little ahead so they could feed and clothe their families, send their children to school. It became more personal to me. It is one thing reading a book, another thing feeling that book and that is what this book does. We grieve with the mothers watching their children have next to nothing to eat, sleeping all day so they would not feel their hunger. Watching many die and yet with so little still sharing what they have with those who have none. Amazingly strong people, who never give up hope, you think it a disgrace to take a government handout. All they want it work, work that pays fairly for their labor, they are willing to do anything they need to do. So they travel, go to where there is supposed to be work. Living in tents, yet still not making enough to hang their hats on, feed their bellies.Unions, organized sit-ins all the precursors to the modern day fairness that we expect in our workplaces. Labor laws and the rest, all because of these starving, amazing people. They came first and fought, starved, died and as with many other instances in history we owe them a debt of gratitude."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "Please, first read the book description. Having read that, you know that this is a book of historical fiction about life in the Oklahoma Panhandle during the Depression and the ecological disaster of the Dust Bowl Era. You will feel you are choking from the dirt during the wind storms. You are starving. You are being thrown from your land by the banks and big businesses. What do you do? The Dunne family joined the stream of other migrant workers traveling westward to the promised land of California, to work on the fruit farms and cotton fields. Hard work, low wages and high costs for housing. A loosing battle. Not a chance in the world to succeed. Have you read about this before? If so, you know what lies in store for the family. Through this book you experience it. YOU are one of the despised Oakies in California. You are in their shoes....if you are lucky enough to have shoes!Sanora Babb, the author, lived herself on the Oklahoma Panhandle. In the 30s, she herself worked through the Farm Security Administration (FSA) camps with the refugee farmers in California. At night she wrote. This book speaks the grim truth. The author knew up close what these people endured. Are you brave enough to find out? She was closer to their lives than Steinbeck ever was. It shows. I loved The Grapes of Wrath too, but the plight of the migrant workers feels somehow more intimate here. Two different authors, too different writing styles, even if the theme is the same. To my mind both are equally good. Both are excellent. Babb has her own way with words - wonderful depictions and wonderful dialogs. She captures how children speak to each other. Babb's is maybe grittier, less abstract. That Random House judged Steinbeck's novel to adequately cover the subject matter is, in my view, completely wrong! Furthermore, I loved the reading of the audiobook by Alyssa Bresnahan. Five stars for the narration too. The ending? It was perfect. If I may say so, Random House made a huge mistake. It is a crime that so few people know of this book. It deserves high acclaim. I will soon be reading An Owl on Every Post, the author's memoir of her childhood on the Great Plains.Oh, one more thing. There is compassion and sharing and love in this book too."}, {"userName": "Roberta Brown", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13192533-roberta-brown", "userReview": "I put this book on \"Hold\" through The Library Network after watching The Dust Bowl documentary on PBS last year; this book finally arrived a few weeks ago, just in time for PBS to rerun the documentary. The story behind this book: Random House editor Bennett Cerf was going to publish this work until John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath beat him to the punch, and Babb's book was considered to be \"a sad anticlimax.\"I have read The Grapes of Wrath; I have found \"whose names are unknown\" to be a better read. Babb's book is a more intimate character study of farmers who started out to be self-reliant and were then beaten back by the weather and poor government policies. Babb's character studies are breath-taking and her observations are profound. Here is a sad statement from the local doctor: \"He always thought it better that no one see how he lived. As he closed the door he could see impersonally the whole jumbled intimacy of the room as that of a lonely man. It made him strangely uneasy, this feeling of having left part of his live unlived. When there are no years left for changing, he thought, these disturbing thoughts are only lulled by the attendant weariness and hopelessness of their repetition.\"Babb's own story is equally absorbing and is shared in the foreword."}, {"userName": "Kristi Thielen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5422600-kristi-thielen", "userReview": "Too bad you can't award more than five stars. Sanora Babb's book is about Oklahomans who hung on to their farms though most of the Dust Bowl years, then walked away from their land and pressed on to California in hopes of a better life. I'll tell no more of the plot than that, because I can't possibly do justice to her magnificent prose. Babb sent the manuscript to a New York publisher who at first was agreeable to publishing the book -then turned her down when the better known John Steinbeck brought in his manuscript for \"Grapes of Wrath.\" Said publisher told her the market wouldn't bear TWO novels covering the same subject area. (What a fool. And how wrong he was. And again - what a fool.) Since Steinbeck availed himself of research done by other writers, including Babb, it is possible - just possible - that HE was inspired by HER. At any rate: she shelved the novel, wrote other things and this didn't get into print until some 70-odd years later. I have longed believed \"Grapes of Wrath\" to be one of the finest books ever. But \"Whose Names are Unknown\" is better by far."}, {"userName": "Sandy ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10715774-sandy", "userReview": "I will not rate this book since I decided (reluctantly) not to finish it. That is not the fault of the author. This book is a masterpiece, slated for publication in 1938 and cancelled because it was too similar to a book by John Steinbeck which had just hit the big time. It was eventually published in 2008.People prefer many different experiences in the stories they read. I had expected that this would be my kind of story. Being the grandchild of pioneers who lived through the \"dust bowl\" years in Saskatchewan, I had expected to relish this story of the survival of a family in drought-stricken Oklahoma.The writing is spectacular, with language as economical as the farm family's meagre meals. There are no wasted words but the descriptions are ample enough to satisfy anyone's appetite for landscape and emotion. I loved reading about one-third of the book. Ultimately, though, Babb's gift for description was more than my claustrophobic self could handle. When the dust storms raged for days on end, I found myself buried with the family in their dugout home. In an effort to keep the dust from coming in, the windows and doors had been boarded up and their dwelling was black as night all day long. This scenario just does not work for me! I could not keep any emotional distance from the story. I cannot even sleep in a bedroom with room-darkening blinds. I have moved on to a happier story. It is what I need right now."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "An amazing historical novel about the Dust Bowl era and the families who exhibited tenacious courage, strength, fortitude, and commendable resilience and faith in dire times. Farming families, covered in dust, drenched in sweat and gritty tears, leaving homesteads and all that's familiar. Migrating...pressing ever onward, seeking brighter days for their children, where drought, dust, disease, and starvation won't consume them. Babb's, \"Whose Names Are Unknown\" surpasses Steinbeck's \"Grapes of Wrath\" by way of portraying 'Okies' with humanizing warmth, and placing less emphasis on bitterness of heart and focusing more on pursuit of betterment - despite insurmountable odds. \"They would rise and fall and, in their falling, they would rise again.\""}, {"userName": "Chris Blocker", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/318724-chris-blocker", "userReview": "You may already know the story of Whose Names Are Unknown and its path to publication. If so, you may wish to skip the next paragraph. I'm including it because I found it fascinating. Truly, it's the primary reason I picked this novel up.In the 1930s, author Sanora Babb was working as a volunteer for the Farm Security Administration in California. She helped in the camps for displaced farmers. Under the recommendation of Tom Collins, the same Collins who served as the primary source for The Grapes of Wrath, Babb began to compile notes about her experience. Twice, she crossed paths with John Steinbeck. Babb went on to write about the workers and the camps in Whose Names Are Unknown. In 1939, she found a publisher for the novel in Random House. All was set. Then The Grapes of Wrath became a sensation. It won the Pulitzer. It won the National Book Award. It was the best selling book of the year. And suddenly, Random House was no longer interested (though they did pay her). In fact, no publisher wanted anything to do with Babb's novel. All knew it would be viewed at best as an anti-climatic follow-up to Steinbeck's novel, at worst a horrible imitation. So Whose Names Are Unknown remained unpublished and unknown until it was picked up by a university press, sixty-five years later, in 2004.Since its publication, there has been some question as to whether one writer was trying to trying to capitalize off the other's project. Some question as to whether one writer used the other's notes. Personally, I think both were just moved by the situation and had the same great idea at the same time. Unfortunately for Babb, her time came a tad too late.Undoubtedly, there is quite a bit of similarity between the two novels. Both focus on an Oklahoman family, despite the fact that the Dust Bowl affected other states as well. Both show their journey to California, bouncing around from camp to camp. Both show the desperation of a family being pushed to its limits. While I strongly feel Whose Names Are Unknown stands on its own, I agree with the publisher: at the time, it would not have had the best results.Yet, Whose Names Are Unknown is not The Grapes of Wrath. Yes, the plots and characters are certainly similar. Even the tone of both pieces, a tone of sadness and protest, was similar. But while Steinbeck moved the Joad family out west as soon as he could, Babb took her time moving the Dunne family. While Steinbeck was much more obvious with his meandering metaphors, Babb stayed primarily focused on the central plot. While Steinbeck unleashed the longest work he'd written up to that point in his life, Babb kept her story incredibly concise. Two sides of the same coin? Yes. But both were stellar in their own regard.As a long-time Steinbeck fan, I'm quite partial to Steinbeck. That said, Whose Names Are Unknown could've easily earned a place alongside The Grapes of Wrath in my heart, but it did fail on one regard: it was too concise. There are times when the Dunne family seems on the brink of collapse. Then the next chapter they're getting along decently. There's no bridge or explanation. This was particularly noticeable at a point in the story when the family is thrown from their small home with all their possessions. The next chapter, the family is in their kitchen with all their possessions. Was this a new home? The old? What happened? There are a few too many moments such as these that keep an observant reader asking, \u201cwhat did I miss?\u201d I can't help but wonder if word got out about Steinbeck's upcoming novel, and if there wasn't a rush to finish this one. That would certainly be a logical reason for some of the holes in the story. Even with the holes, however, the reader can surmise what happened in the in-between and not miss too much.So fellow writers, remember the lesson of Babb and Steinbeck: while you're sitting on your wonderful idea, a muse may be handing your novel to another writer. Not that I think Babb was sitting on her idea, or made any wrong choices in the matter, but it's still a valuable lesson. No, I think the misfortunes of Whose Names Are Unknown can be chalked up to the cosmos or fate or chance or whatever you want to call it. Fortunately, we now have access to this great work, and while it may be too late for the migratory workers of the 1930s, it might be just in time for our current mounting troubles with the climate and worker's rights. Maybe the fates had reason to delay this novel's publication."}, {"userName": "Annette", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2006", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1927559-annette", "userReview": "Ironically this book was almost unknown. In 1939 editor Bennett Cerf was finalizing publication plans for it, when John Steinbeck's http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ste... Grapes of Wrath captured national interest. Cerf mistakenly judged that Steinbeck's novel had covered the subject and shelved the manuscript. Unknown for 30 years except for an underground network of scholars, Sanora Babb's work http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obit... now provides a welcome companion to Steinbeck's classic epic. In certain aspects, Babb's novel is more realistic and insightful. Having worked as a journalist for a few years during the Depression in the Farm Security Administration (FCA) at government migrant camps in California, Babb's writing shows a deeper understanding of the displaced people's lives. She also provides a female viewpoint of that turbulent and challenging era. Steinbeck devoted much of his book to the male view and details of the road trip to California. Similar to Steinbeck, Babb setup her novel's basis with the story of the Dunne family's dust bowl farm experience in the Oklahoma panhandle. When the Dunne's are finally forced to leave, she quickly moves them to California, fieldwork, and their mistreatment as migrant workers. Like Steinbeck, she sympathetically focuses on experiences that led to changed perceptions and lives. She moves the Dunnes from emotions of confusion and despair to glimmers of hope. Babb's masterpiece is a wonderful and equal companion and deserves to be placed alongside The Grapes of Wrath.

I stretched to give it a 3 for the characters of Milt, Myra, Mrs. Starwood. I absolutely understand why The Grapes of Wrath overshadowed it. This reads like a strident, exaggerated, nearly cartoonish in tragedy, radical politico proof copy. Not to say that these horrific failures and suffering did not happen. It's just the language of the portrayal. To me it is also choppy in its transitions. So much so that it nearly has no continuity as one novel and I became confused in character referrals. The California sections don't seem to carry the individuality of the characters that were so formed during the first half. Their depth of thought patterns or emotions just seemed to get translated into want and need. So much so that it becomes an invisible narrator tale. \"Milt did this, Lonnie did that\" kind of recital. You no longer seem to be within the sod house family dynamic. Maybe that was planned?I believe this book gets the rating it does because of the empathy level of the readers. The first half is a full 3 star, but objectively or subjectively, IMHO on the entire, it is not written well.

Somehow they must earn enough money to survive for five years, build some kind of domicile, and improve the land. How could they do that in a place where droughts were common and winds nearly constant? The answer was to grow whatever crops the land would support, crops for which there was a market. Wheat. And to watch the sky, hoping for rain.The family, Milt and Julia, their two daughters, and Milt\u2019s father, Konkie, lived in a dugout, partially below ground, and they yearned for a crop that would allow them to improve their conditions, build a real house, put some money away to help them get through the bad years. It was not to be. Like Steinbeck\u2019s fictional Joad family, they set out for California. Conditions there were even worse.Sanora Babb waited sixty-five years before her book was published. Reference to Whose Names are Unknown in the recent Ken Burns\u2019 documentary on the Dust Bowl has given it new life. Yet Babb\u2019s novel stands alone in one important way: she is entirely sympathetic to the men and women who were caught up in this environmental disaster.In the Burns documentary there is a subtle attitude of scorn for the farmers. They might have been hard-working, but they should never have plowed up the prairie. They should have had better sense. They were greedy. Rather than follow the contours of the land, they plowed in straight lines. If a crop failed, they planted a larger crop the following year.Babb has a different perspective. With the offer of free land, the Homestead Act encouraged poor people to settle on land that was marginal, at best, suitable only for dryland farming, difficult to irrigate. When their crops failed, banks were quick to foreclose. California\u2019s corporate landowners treated the \u201cOkies\u201d with a harshness and a heartlessness that is hard to imagine.Through her portrayal of the downtrodden in society, Sanora Babb offers hope that the mighty will be dislodged, and the poor will ultimately rise up."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19016426-amy", "userReview": "I devoured it in two days \u2013 would have been one if I hadn\u2019t stopped to do homework.

I have always been fascinated by The Depression, and ever since I read The Grapes of Wrath in 2007 (at the height of the foreclosure crisis, just as it was beginning to spill into the rest of the economy), it pulls at my mind and heart continuously. The images of the unfeeling machinery of the banks that repossessed the farmers\u2019 livelihoods as against the actual machinery they needed to perform their work as against their profound, raw, agonizing, emotional experiences of life\u2026I can\u2019t put it into words, but it touches me deeply. Babb\u2019s work taps into that feeling in a way that is indescribably more touching than Steinbeck\u2019s. Her book is much, much shorter, and maybe that\u2019s where it\u2019s impact lies. Its simplicity is so like the outward simplicity of the people it portrays. But underneath there is so much more.

But the book itself--with its history of acceptance-then-rejection--serves as a scrappy, uplifting tale of ultimate victory that its own plot lacks.With many story elements in common with Steinbeck's masterpiece, Babb's tale of displaced Okies is notable for its spare prose style and a lack of lush description. Instead, the book hammers its political viewpoint with steady, unblinking realism and almost no \"speechifying.\"The most depressing element of the book, for me, was its continued relevance today.

It is the story of their struggles to survive in the Oaklahoma Panhandle and later, the even worse conditions of life they endured as farm workers in the California valleys after they left their miserable farm due to the dust storms. It is a poignant story of ecological disaster and migrant camps, a truly sad and moving tale of courage and perseverance.Sanora Babb lived as a child in the dryland farm region that would become the Dust Bowl. She had a deeply personal knowledge of her subject. Later on, she worked with refugee farmers in the Farm Security Administration camps of California. She kept a diary of her experience which would later become this novel. FSA administrator, Tom Collins, (to whom Steinbeck's Grapes is dedicated, along with Steinbeck's wife, Carol) asked for her notes because he thought they would be valuable for Steinbeck, who had been researching the subject. The result of this research was GRAPES OF WRATH.Apparently, over the years, several allegations of plagiarism of appropriation of another author's materials have been levelled at Steinbeck. Many passages in his novel are very similar to scenes in Babb's text. WHOSE NAMES ARE UNKNOWN was intended for publication but when GRAPES OF WRATH became a best seller, Random House explained that the market could not support two books on the subject. So for many years this novel went unpublished.I have to admit that I don't like Steinbeck's writing style. I dislike his second rate philosophising and his forcing of heavy handed opinions upon the reader. When I found an \"alternative\" to GRAPES OF WRATH I was overjoyed. I wanted to read about the Dust Bowl, but not Steinbeck's novel. Apparently, many people think that Sanora Babb's novel is much better than Steinbeck's. I can't vouch for that, but I definitely recommend this novel. You will find no stiff characters in Babb's novel, no puppets who function as a vehicle for Steinbeck's ideas.

Lyrically written about a not-so lyrical subject. What those people must have had to go through. They plant a crop, things look good for a harvest, the dust blows in and destroys all plans and dreams. And the house is filthy once again. Everything gets taken outside, washed, freshened and returned just in time for it to happen again. You can only imagine the frustration. Many leave for California where things are different but no better."}, {"userName": "Steph (loves water)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14405289-steph-loves-water", "userReview": "Outstanding. I loved this book, the characters, and you could tell she was a fantastic journalist. I can see where J. Steinbeck might've used her notes, and I can see the wisdom in not publishing this book at the same time as Grapes of Wrath. They are two very different books, but where Babb is the reporter, Steinbeck was the storyteller. I had my doubts when I heard about this book until I read it, as TGOW is one of my favorite books of all time. But Sanora Babb does it just as well in her own way. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64583-mary", "userReview": "This book is the one that was overlooked and shunted aside for The Grapes of Wrath. It admirably portrays the dust bowl, the folks who struggled to live with nothing and their sad journey to migrant labor in California. Despite being worn slick trying to hold onto life despite drought and the terrible treatment of others, these families hold on to their dignity."}, {"userName": "Kelly Jackson", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23025771-kelly-jackson", "userReview": "It's no wonder this book wasn't published when it was originally slated to hit the shelves. It blows Steinbeck's \"Grapes of Wrath\" out of literary history. This book is astounding and personal, violent and hateful, beautiful and powerful.

A great book, listened to audio, will read text. I am disappointed that it is not found in the entire library system. It should be in every library. I am trying to get a hard copy from a college but the librarian said, maybe, if they decide to give it up. It reflects , to me, how things have not changed, and how workers are more disposable than ever. The combined income of all workers has no political power anymore. Unions crippled by threats to their medical benefits. Republicans are hell bent on a serf economy and most democrats are out of touch with the severity of decades of oligarchy. The book, actually, is not about politics, it is about people, families, trying to get by. Just, it seems so real now, the powerlessness, Flint water supply, multiple jobs and longer hours to not get ahead, no respect for laborers. I hear it and I see it. Multiple family members and strangers sharing one apartment or home, not beautiful ones, the week's pay all to groceries. So many with no cars, walking miles to work to catch a bus. A woman washing clothes in her bathtub because her landlord never got around to the washer, won't let her buy one. Laundromats are expensive. Kids who can't do sports because their parents don't have cars. Cars, washers and dryers, these aren't things you can obtain by working two jobs or cutting back on groceries or a cup of coffee. It just seems like there are different worlds out there, distinct classes that have no idea how the others live. Prime soil for Trump fertilizer."}], "description": "Originally written and slated for publication in 1939, this long-forgotten masterpiece was shelved by Random House when The Grapes of Wrath met with wide acclaim. In the belief that Steinbeck already adequately explored the subject matter, Babb's lyrical novel about a farm family's relentless struggle to survive in both Depression-era Oklahoma and in the California migrant labor camps gathered dust for decades. Rescued from obscurity by the University of Oklahoma Press, the members of the poor but proud Dunne family and their circle of equally determined friends provide another legitimate glimpse into life on the dust-plagued prairies of the Southwest and in the fertile, but bitterly disappointing, orchards and vineyards of the so-called promised land. Babb, a native of Oklahoma's arid panhandle and a volunteer with the Farm Security Administration in Depression-era California, brings an insider's knowledge and immediacy to this authentically compelling narrative. A slightly less political, more female-oriented, companion piece to The Grapes of Wrath.", "title": "Whose Names Are Unknown", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1197158.Whose_Names_Are_Unknown", "average": 4.09, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328814759l/1197158.jpg", "reviews": 165, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/145790.Sanora_Babb", "name": "Sanora Babb"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/636091.Lawrence_R_Rodgers", "name": "Lawrence R.
