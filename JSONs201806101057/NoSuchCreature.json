I certainly do not want to begrudge them the opportunity to move in different directions; after writing a number of books revolving around the same cast of characters, most authors need to break away from the boundaries they've set for themselves. In the case of Giles Blunt, I am a fan of his John Cardinal police procedural series and was not quite happy to see that his most recent book did not continue with that character and setting. Unfortunately, my fears were justified.No Such Creature features 18-year-old Owen Maxwell and his 80-something Uncle Max. When Owen's parents died eight years earlier, it looked like he was destined to live in a foster home. However, at the last minute, Uncle Max, a heretofore unknown relative from England, appeared on the scene and took care of Owen. Max was once a Shakespearean actor, and he is always performing some sort of role. He has taken Owen under his wing and on the road to participate in his real profession as a gentleman thief who attends parties and robs the participants of their goods. Even at his young age, Owen is getting tired of the life. He wants to end the heists and attend Juilliard. At the same time, he is very concerned because Max is showing signs of dementia. Stubbornly, Max refuses to give up the robberies. Meanwhile, there is another group of thieves who are making life hard for Max, Owen and their associates. Known as the Subtractors, they think nothing of removing various body parts to get the information they need. And then there's the femme fatale, Sabrina, whose background echoes Owen's. From the moment they meet, their actions are quite predictable.No Such Creature was a big disappointment to me. One of the best things that Blunt does in the Cardinal series is to create rich and full characters with great emotional depth. That skill seems to have deserted him in this book. Max was full of irritating affectations, which I assume were supposed to make him amusingly eccentric. Max's selfish refusal to leave the life was in direct contrast to his deciding to care for Owen. Owen at the age of 18 and Sabrina at 20 seemed years older; Sabrina in particular is portrayed in a world weary way that made me feel that she was at least in her thirties. They never came to life. There were some absolutely silly bits that just didn't work, such as Max dancing an amorous dance with one of the party goers at the conclusion of a robbery. I believe it was Blunt's intention to create a caper, but the book never had the requisite zaniness that requires."}, {"userName": "Clare", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/984138-clare", "userReview": "I am a huge fan of Giles Blunt and his mystery series set in Ontario's near north. I assumed when I requested to review this book that it would be in the same series and I was disappointed that it wasn't. However, I like Blunt's writing, so I decided to read it on its own merits. Having put it down a few times to read other things I finally finished it the other day and I can't say I was blown away.I usually need to like at least one of the main characters in a book to care about what happens to them, but I couldn't care about these characters. An old con man and his nephew on their \"last hurrah\" across the US are tracked by badder thieves who want to hurt them and take their money. Well, that's what you get when you live a life of crime. That kind of story is sometimes done well (I think of Ocean's Eleven) but I think it fell flat this time. I look forward to Blunt's next book, but I must confess I hope it's a John Cardinal mystery."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41933-lori", "userReview": "The only Giles Blunt novels I've read before this one were ones in the John Cardinal series.This is a stand alone novel, not part of the series, not set in Northern Ontario.For all the things it was not, it was a good book, following the story of Owen and his great uncle Max as they travel the United States planning and carrying out \"performances\" which are really just meticulously planned robberies.Of course you have to throw in a pretty girl, an angry ex-boyfriend and some health issues that threaten their way of life.I prefer the John Cardinal series but I will try more of Blunt's stand alones."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2134763-ron", "userReview": "Well, just barely a 4...why don't they give us more stars?This was a fun read, different sort of idea.I think 10 stars would give us a better selection, or just let us type in a number from 1-100--that would make this book about a 70 or so, but not 80; does 4 stars mean 80% or does it mean between 61% t0 80% likeable?I'll try at least one more of his books.Yeah, I think more options for rating would be better--this gets soooo frustrating.

It is a caper of sorts in which a would be actor enlists the aid of his adopted nephew to commit a series of crimes. His nephew is not really up for the criminal activity though he does love his uncle and enjoys some portions of their extended road trip. There are some humorous parts, but there are serious undertones. I think I like his other books much more"}, {"userName": "Luke Gregoire", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29086830-luke-gregoire", "userReview": "Another great novel from Canadian Gilles Blunt.

This novel has a humorous side to it, has a much lighter concept which is mixed with serious and sad moments.This is a tale of two unconventional thieves, one an old English actor and the other his great nephew. It is a story of sightseeing and larceny while travelling across the American southwest in a Winnebago.Problems arise during their last summer's adventure, Max and Owen encounter more than they expect when they discover they are pursued by a mysterious group known as the Subtractors, and also Max's old friend who wants part of the take....This is a multitude of crime capers with drama and violence. The lack of honour amongst thieves adds to the excitement. This was not enough for Mr Blunt he also adds romance and romantic competition with the introduction of Sabrina, all this creates interesting predicaments.I found this novel quite captivating and comical. Max's theatrical approach to his profession and his Shakespearean language add humour to the suspense. The dialogue is highly entertaining and the characters quite likable, Max and Owen bicker throughout the novel but it is obvious that they are family. Sabrina's description of her life with a criminal father is very moving.This is a fun and enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/284410-beth", "userReview": "Owen, orphaned at age 10 after his parents are killed in a car accident, was taken under the wing of his great uncle, who taught him everything he knows and introduced him to theatrical life of posing at the dinner parties of the elite to rob them of their cash and jewels. Now 18, Owen wants to quit their life of crime and pursuing acting at Juilliard, where he has been offered a partial scholarship, but he worries about leaving uncle Max alone, especially given his recent bouts of senility... and now, it turns out, the Subtractors (a band of thieves who steal from thieves by removing body parts until they get the information and goods they seek) may be after the gentleman thief duo.The action is fast paced, the writing descriptive, and the premise, intriguing; Owen is a compelling character, in part due to Blunt's skillful flashback. Point of view changes within each chapter, making the story occassionally difficult to follow. I had to put the book down at page 54 when a supporting villain had sex with a drug-addicted minor. A quick skim to the end revealed a plot point that I'd figured out on page 48.

The pace was fast and the story engrossing, the characters fun and just a touch archetypal. It certainly wasn't going to be a great book, but it was going to be a great read - like Agatha Christie or Elmore Leonard, a deeply enjoyable book that you might recommend to a friend with a long flight or a few days on a beach, but not something you'd consider re-reading until you'd forgotten the majority of the plot.But as time went by, I found myself enjoying the book less and less - it became a little predictable, and what wasn't predictable was dissatisfying - some of the minor plot lines ended with a disappointing whimper, the characters' archetype-type qualities either became muted or so repetitive that they became a touch annoying - sometimes it became clear that they were just a plot device with a quirk thrown in to give them a little depth. Don't get me wrong, it was still an awfully enjoyable read, and I'd still recommend it for long flights or lazy days on a beach, but I'd do it with muted enthusiasm."}, {"userName": "Bobbie  Crawford", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1326467-bobbie-crawford", "userReview": "No Such CreatureWritten By: Giles BluntPublished By: Random House CanadaDate: October 14th, 2008Pages: 270Format: HardcoverISBN: 978-0679314318No Such Creature is a fast-paced mystery/crime drama that engages the read and is very hard to put down.

Both about criminal families in different eras.Owen is young man orphaned and brought up by his thespian great uncle, who's love and knowledge of Shakespeare is vast. However, lovable Uncle Max is more than just a failed actor; he's a master thief and has schooled Owen in the art of robbery. Their M.O. up to very recently has been to uses disguises and to never use violence. But something is not quite right with Max lately, he has become forgetful and has terrifying night visitations from various infamous criminals and has for the first time in his long law breaking career, actually shot somebody. Owen has his own issues, besides dealing with Max, with wanting to pursue his own acting career, and falling too quickly in love with the bitter and beautiful daughter of another vintage gangster.

I really enjoyed reading every bit of this story with some scenes being very humorous and with some of the twists being very suspicious, like were they true or just another of Max's play acting? Can't risk a spoiler by specifically naming the actual twist I'm referring to but you'll recognize it when it comes! While the the way the story ends is probably the only ending possible I was a bit disappointed. I guess it's OK to have a logical and appropriate ending to a story and still, personally, not like the way it ends.

There's no mystery whatsoever. It's a family relationship book, but I don't care about the relationship or the people in it, and the big reveal is telegraphed from early on. It's competently written in many ways (though it smells a little bit of \"American road trip justified for tax purposes with a book to legitimize deductions,\" if the Canadian tax system works that way), but...it's really not a good book or even an okay book, I'm sorry to say."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3234545-judy", "userReview": "I started reading Giles Blunt for his cop series set in North Bay because I used to live in North Bay.
