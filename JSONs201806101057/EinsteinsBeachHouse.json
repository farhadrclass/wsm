The author has a unique voice which clearly echoes in his stories. Each story has its own unique flavor and taste but has one common thread among them - that they are both funny and tragic (tragic, to some extent). Each story keeps you hooked, and the author has written such that you get so engrossed in it that it feels the story is happening around you, and you are there and watching it. He takes from everyday life situations something unusual and makes a story out of it from nowhere, and leave you spellbound.HUE AND CRY: It is the first story in the book, and was quite moving. It did not made an impact when I finished reading it. But it was after a day or two that I realized it had many levels to it, and that it evoked nostalgia with a flavor. It was the father of the narrator that seemed to be a great character, and actually he was, but every human being is vulnerable and has his shortcomings. And it was the climax of the story that shows this flaw in human nature.LA TRISTESSE DES H\u00c9RISSONS: The translation of the title is THE SADNESS OF HEDGEHOGS. A couple adopts a hedgehog, instead of having a baby. This hedgehog turns out to be a nightmare for the husband, who unwillingly submits to the whims of his wife. And it turns out that hedgehog is depressed (actually it\u2019s his wife that finds that out) and that triggers a chain reaction, which acts as adding fuel to the fire, and sours the already soured relationship, further. But it was funny in a way (from the point of view of the boy); and it turns out the girl was actually depressed. STRINGS: The story starts with when an ex-lover of a lady, who is married now, ask for her help; and she unwillingly helps him, and this created an inner turmoil in her and she gets irritated and furious over it, unconsciously. This story was very beautiful, and had an emotional depth to it, and shows the strange yet soothing warmth of a loving relationship between a wife and her husband. I was hooked on this story, and really liked it. LIMERENCE: It was just perfect, a perfect short story that reminded me of Chekhov and Tagore. I was hooked from the first line, and finished it in one sitting. It's a bitter-sweet story like all the others so far. It's a story told in reminiscence by a boy about a girl, how he fell for her despite knowing that she is not virgin and changes her boy friends as regularly as one would change clothes. Einstein\u2019s Beach House: There is a deep connection with Einstein\u2019s Beach House in the story, which is the ultimate cause of their fortune, and above all - for their misery."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201cI insert the bevel and draw back the plunger. I know that the syringe contains more than sodium chloride-that even as the toxic contents fill my father\u2019s veins, he is sharing with me his final gift: the horror and thrill of saving lives.\u201d Reading this collection of stories reminded me that I don\u2019t read enough short stories. I keep hearing that people are becoming more interested in short story collections because they fit so well with our abbreviated attention spans, busy schedules, and our tweet/text diminutive information needs. Who has time to read a whole novel anyway? Well, me for one. Just because I make the time to read novels doesn\u2019t mean that I should forgo the stepchild of publishing...the short story collection. After all, I\u2019m not allowed to discriminate against short people why therefore should I be allowed to snub stubby stories. I can\u2019t tell you how many people, when they find out that I read, say, as if it is an original thought usually accompanied by a heavy sigh while violin music softly plays in the background: \u201cI wish I had time to read.\u201d I stifle a yawn and usually either ignore them or say:\u201cEveryone has time to read. You just choose to do other things.\u201d The impression that people have about reading is that it is something you do when you have ABSOLUTELY nothing else to do. I don\u2019t know how many times, when I\u2019m sitting at the auto dealership waiting on my car or on a plane or on a train or on a park bench reading, someone will start talking to me because obviously if I\u2019ve resorted to reading I must be BORED OUT OF MY FRILLING MIND. So why not replace Fyodor Dostoevsky, Raymond Chandler, or Virginia Woolf with idle chit chat about the weather or their goiter issues or their granddaughter\u2019s exploits on the soccer field. The point I was leading up to is that now, instead of giving my typical snarky reply that just makes people even less interested in reading because who wants to be like the intellectual a$$hole who just made them feel like a dumba$$, I will pull out my phone and queue up Amazon and say order this damn book\u2026YOU have time for this book. The \u201cI wish I had time to read\u201d tax will now be the cost of this book. I will look at their wristwatch and their shoes and make a quick determination if they have to buy a brand new copy. If they are wearing a t-shirt that looks like it has been washed on stones in a river or shoes that are held together by twine or a sundial on their wrist, I might point out the fact that they can buy used ones for pennies. There are eight stories in this collection, not even double digits, so again if TIME is an issue, you can have this book read easily within a week by just reading one story a day and two on Sunday ( this slender volume fits easily in the middle of a Bible or a hymnal). They are Cheeveresque with a little T. C. Boyle hot sauce added to the mix. I didn\u2019t really pick up any Raymond Carver, but then it has been awhile since I\u2019ve read Carver, so he might have been standing in the shadows between sentences, and I simply missed him. I do wonder if Jacob M. Appel has a time machine and set it to take him back to Iowa City, Iowa, in 1973 to have sex with Cheever, smoke weed with Boyle, and drink shots with Carver.That M. in the middle of his name looks suspicious, like maybe it stands for Mathematical, Mechanical, or Machine. The thing of it is books are time machines, so Appel didn\u2019t have to build one. The pages of the books that Cheever, Boyle, and Carver all wrote will take all of us forwards and backwards in time without ever necessitating that we leave our armchairs. He didn\u2019t need a DeLorean; he only needed a bus that could take him down to the nearest bookstore or public library. These stories are about redemption, the first love that we are usually fortunate to escape, time shared turtles, illness withering the strength of a father, deaf-mute sex so as not to further disturb a disturbed hedgehog, of someone so happy at what IS instead of what could have been, a bit of scheming with Einstein, imaginary lovers, and a daughter caught in a whirlpool of her father\u2019s madness. All the stories are strong, but three of them are really something special. I was going to parcel these elite eight out over several days, but frankly I couldn\u2019t leave them alone. I kept putting aside the novels that were bristling with bookmarks and post-it notes and indulged myself by reading another Appel story. I soon ran out of pages and was eyeing the empty white pages at the back of the book in much the same manner in which I peer into the empty bottle of a fine single malt scotch...satisfied, but looking for more.

I didn't know what to expect from this book and from this author but the overall impact it brought me was beyond my expectations. This book consists of 8 short stories, each with different themes but all in all, coming up with one thing -- life experiences. The writing style of Jacob M. Appel is so impressive. He has this unique plot and great, three-dimensional characterization and he laces everything with humor and emotional conflict that even if each story was short, I felt as if I was reading a regular-length book.I made a brief review for each story because I was too overwhelmed with everything in this book and here they are:1. Hue and CryThis is the first short story of Einsten's Beach House. It's a dark and twisted story, with an underlying sensitive issue that centers a man who is a sex offender. How he was treated by the people around him totally describes harsh reality. I don't know exactly what to feel about this but I can say that the author very well establishes a great reality-based story. 2. La tristesse des h\u00e9rissonThis second short story held a very heavy topic which was handled perfectly with humor. It's about a couple who adopted a hedgehog. Sounds a bit normal but the moment they took the hedgehog home, their relationship slowly went downhill because of some psychological issues that were focused on the hedgehog. If you read this book blindly, you will appreciate the hidden message the author was conveying. This short story is beautiful and gripping. It's psychological and an eye-opener. We tend to blame other people for the fault which is entirely done by ourselves and act this defense mechanism which is so-called displacement. 3. Strings\n\"It's much better to not be okay when you ought to be fine, than to be perfectly content when you really should be falling to pieces.\"\nWell this third short story hits home. It's about a 40 year-old woman who was approached by her ex-lover who's a musician, for a favor. At first I didn't get the message behind the story but when I reached the ending-- wow! The story sent a deep, powerful message that hit straight to the core. It's about defining the value of success and failure and how each person's approach towards these things vary. It's also more about moving on and forgiveness.4. LimerenceThe fourth short story of this book completely stole my heart. It's heartbreaking. It's a flashback story about a teenage boy and a girl whose friendship started right when they were in high school. Despite the girl's imperfections and issues in life, the boy slowly developed feelings for her, which was unfortunately not returned due to the girl's circumstances and misfortunes. I love how this short-length of a story felt longer than I've thought. There was so much emotional depth in this story. The melancholy tone also made me feel like I'm reading a Nicholas Sparks book. From the beginning up to the end, I was pleasantly moved because of the great characterization the author was able to distinguish and the emotions being poured that tugged at my heartstrings. 5. Einstein's Beach HouseNow this fifth story is more about the things that usually happen in the family household. It's about a couple with two kids who live in a beachfront house which was perceived as Albert Einstein's beach house. As they later on made the house a source of their income through the tourists that usually visit because of their curiosity, they later on learned that in fact, the house was originally owned by Einstein's niece. What made this short story brilliant was how the author emphasized the essence of sentimental value for a particular thing and how a person values childhood and family relationships. The ending of this short story was so touching!6. The Rod of AsclepiusBy far, this sixth short story is my most favorite of all. I loved the dark theme in which a father and a daughter bonded through some twisted kind of activity. In this story, the father was introduced by the author in a very mysterious way. He pretended to be a doctor whenever he enters the hospital and when he's inside a particular room, he injects random patients, basically killing them. But he always did it together with her daughter who was a seven year-old. As the girl grew up, the memory of what happened still lingered and even served as a traumatic experience to her. This is such a brilliant, dark story. It's cringe-worthy and as usual, very well-written. It also gives a reader something to ponder in the end.7. Sharing the HostageThis short story is particularly funny! It's about a divorced woman who wanted her tortoise, which was already in the hands of her ex-husband, back. The ex-couple didn't have a child but the way they value the turtle, sharing a joint custody, as if it's their own child, was so hilarious and strange. The woman and her lover planned to abduct the tortoise from her ex-husband but when they've already had it, they realized that maybe after all, they shouldn't have took it because it won't survive in their planned trip. All throughout the story, I was laughing because of its unrealistic but hilarious approach. In the end, I realized that the story itself shows the importance of giving value to a certain thing-- no matter how small or big it is.8. ParacosmosThe last short story of Einstein's Beach House is charming. The story centers around a small family consisting a couple and a daughter. The daughter had an imaginary friend whom the couple thought was alarming. This short story is realistic in a way because having an imaginary friend is part of childhood. The message behind the story was also amazing. It emphasizes importance of family bonding and of course, the importance of fidelity.As a whole, Einstein's Beach House is a masterpiece and a real gem! I am so thankful to have been given a copy of this book from the author because it's a book that I will forever treasure. The contents are all unique, amazing, and very well-written, in a can't-put-it-down way. It's a powerful anthology that explores every sensible and even psychological aspect of life. If you want a wholesome, thought-provoking reads, I highly recommend this anthology!Rating:"}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "4.5 starsI think this secret gem of a book has the power to convert short-story-shy readers. It\u2019s that good. Such a satisfying read! It\u2019s one of those books where the first sentence of each story compels you to continue. Yum yum, read on, my mind instructed me. I kept getting sucked in. Here\u2019s the opening line of one story, called Paracosmos. Who could resist?\u201cLeslie traced their difficulties to before the parrot-fever scare, to before even the chimney sweep\u2019s scrotum, to the summer night when her husband proposed naming the baby Quarantina.\u201d The stories are off-beat and spectacular. There are some that are pretty far out: a couple adopts a depressed hedgehog, a woman and her boyfriend fight over a pet turtle, a woman has a fling with the father of her daughter\u2019s imaginary friend. The two animal stories were a little much for me, a little too quirky, but I still enjoyed them. Even the super realistic stories have intriguing characters with unusual dilemmas and tense interactions. You don\u2019t know where the story is going, so there\u2019s some cool suspense as well. Some stories are sort of funny\u2014not in a ha-ha way, but it\u2019s sly humor that\u2019s sometimes mixed with tragedy. It\u2019s a pro who can combine humor and tragedy successfully, and Appel shows he\u2019s got the stuff.My favorite story is The Rod of Asclepius. First off, no, I don\u2019t like the title, and yes, I had to look it up. (Fact download: Asclepius is the god of medicine in Greek and Roman religion and mythology.) I sort of resent having to look it up, and I\u2019m not even sure how to pronounce it. I think I\u2019d have trouble telling friends they just have to read The Rod of Asclepius. I can hear them say, \u201cHuh? Repeat that please.\u201d I\u2019d struggle to spit it out, embarrassed and annoyed. That question, of course, would be followed by, \u201cHuh? What does it mean?\u201d And then I\u2019d have to recite the Wikipedia entry when really I just want to gush about the story. Anyway, it\u2019s about a widower who drags his daughter on mysterious trips to hospitals. The ending is fantastic. It\u2019s one of those stories that I won\u2019t forget, and that\u2019s pretty rare with short stories, at least for me. I often have this great feeling when I finish a short story collection, but I have trouble remembering the plots and just what made me feel so good. There are at least two other stories in the book that I know I\u2019ll remember too.A couple of the stories have ambiguous endings\u2014something that bugs the hell out of me. The stories are so grand, though, that I forgive the author for it. Sometimes I think ambiguous endings are a cop-out, like the author is saying, \u201cHm\u2026I don\u2019t know how to end this, so you just go ahead and decide how you want it to end\u2026.that\u2019s cool.\u201d I don\u2019t want to decide what happens next, thank you, I want you to finish it, author. It\u2019s your job to tell me a complete story! Anyway, lots of people enjoy ambiguity; it just doesn\u2019t work for me.A silly complaint: The damn paperback feels yucky, like it\u2019s covered in slightly sticky dust. If it\u2019s supposed to be velvety, there\u2019s definitely something wrong with my sense of touch. For me it\u2019s a quiet version of fingernails on a chalkboard. Drove me nuts; I couldn\u2019t stand picking the book up, even though I loved what was inside. I\u2019m now sort of used to it, but I still feel the need to wash the imaginary dust off my hands each time I hold the book.The author offered to send me this book, a request that always gets my dander up because of its pushiness. But in this case, I am so glad he did. What a treat! His bio says that among other things, he\u2019s a doctor and a lawyer (and Indian chief? I wouldn\u2019t doubt it!). What an amazing genius! His writing is just impeccable. How does he find the time to do all that he does? How can he be a great writer and have all these other talents? I\u2019m in awe. I\u2019ll be checking out his other books, that is a certainty."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "A few weeks ago I noticed that a couple of my GR friends, karen and Mary Beth, had both read and reviewed this collection of short stories and given it highly positive reviews. I was all, \"Hey! I love short stories!\" even though since finishing my English B.A. the vast majority of the short stories I've read have been of the SF/fantasy variety. So I brashly sent a PM to the author, Jacob Appel, asking him if he'd be interested in sending me his book for review, and he very kindly said yes, and sent me an honest-to-goodness paperback copy rather than the ebook I was expecting, which is just one more thing that endeared him to me.There is a thin line that separates laughter and pain, comedy and tragedy, humor and hurt.-- Erma BombeckThe eight stories in this collection explore this thin line, and the humor and pain in the lives and the relationships of ordinary people. Sometimes I would be smiling right up to the time the story gave me a gut punch of despair. In other stories I could feel hope shining through the pain. All of the stories were thought-provoking and disturbed my complacence. \"Hue and Cry\" - Two teenage girls: one audacious and reckless, the other anxious to please her friend. A sex offender in the neighborhood. Vocally incensed neighbors. A dying father trying to teach his daughter about forgiveness. The pieces add up to both less and more than you might expect.\"La Tristesse Des Herissons\" (the sadness of hedgehogs) - a man and his live-in girlfriend adopt a hedgehog, Orion, which promptly develops depression and other mental conditions--or does it?--that the girlfriend insists on having treated by a very expensive specialist. The boyfriend thinks this is ridiculous but is (mostly) biting his tongue because his girlfriend is so wrapped up in this. A little transference? One of the funniest stories in the book, but it was killing me at the same time. \"Strings\" - Beware of former lovers asking favors. The ending of this story was a paradigm-shifter. So good.\"Limerance\" - An ode to the girl who got away, who was never really the boy's at all, who probably would have been terrible for the boy if she'd ever given him the time of day. A great exploration of teenage relationships and unrequited crushes.Einstein's Beach House\" - Another tragicomedy, or comical tragedy. A family claims to be living in a beach house once owned by Albert Einstein, and then everything gets upended. I'm still a little confused about what really happened here...\"The Rod of Asclepius\" - A 6 year old daughter accompanies her widowed father as he seeks revenge for his wife's death.What my six-year-old self doesn't realize then, though it is clear to me now, is that this may be the first time my father has left our apartment in several months, that I am witnessing the man emerge from a winter-long twilight of raw anger... \"Are you ready to change the world, princess?\" he asks. At that moment, I am suddenly persuaded that the world does indeed require changing, that the entire cosmos yearns for radical transformation.Heartbreaking in so many ways.\"Sharing the Hostage\" - More animal humor, as a desert tortoise named Fred becomes the center of attention between a divorcing couple and the wife's new boyfriend. Orion and Fred would get along well, I think. Fred is a placid soul who would probably help even out Orion's jags.\"Paracosmos\" - Imaginary friends can become a little too real. Or are they real?Jacob Appel's stories are well-written and touching. I highly recommend this book to readers who appreciate tragi-comical stories that raise questions with no easy answers.ETA: After thinking about this for several more days, I realized that these stories are really sticking with me. That's one of my main criteria for a 5-star read, so I'm upping my rating from 4 stars to 5. These stories won't be everyone's cuppa tea, but those who like this type of literature will really love them.

I was impressed by his previous work, Scouting for the Reaper, but the eight stories here seem even more honed and polished, and I can find no fault with any of them.Like George Saunders, Appel delights in taking a mild-mannered characters who are used to doing only what common sense dictates, flinging weird circumstances at them and then describing how they deal with the intrusion. Here you will meet men whose love-interests are obsessed with pet tortoises and hedgehogs, a man whose money-making scheme leads to catastrophic results, and a rabbi who finds there are strings attached when she lets a former beau hold a concert for 400 cellos in her sanctuary.Everyone has problems to deal with and their solutions often have unexpected consequences.My favorite story, Paracosmos, concerns a family who is deeply affected by the daughter's imaginary friend.

And boy, did I love this one.The eight stories in \nEinstein's Beach House\n are slightly quirky (but not distractingly so), somewhat moving and each at least a little bit humorous, and extremely memorable. Jacob Appel does such a great job developing his characters and the plot of each story, I honestly could see many of them developed into a full-length novel, and I'd definitely want to read those books, since I wanted more of the characters.It honestly is hard to pick favorites, since each story was just so good, but the few that I can't stop thinking about right now are: \"Paracosmos,\" in which a married couple is worried that their daughter is obsessed with her imaginary friend\u2014and then the girl's father shows up; \"La Tristesse Des Herissons,\" which tells the story of a couple whose relationship hits a bit of a snag when they adopt a depressed hedgehog; \"Limerence,\" in which a man looks back on his crush on his much more worldly next-door neighbor; \"The Rod of Asclepius,\" which tells the story of a young girl caught up in her father's acts of revenge; and the title story, in which a family tries to make hay of a typo in a travel guide, only to have the tables turned on them.I had never heard of Jacob Appel until two friends on Goodreads raved about his writing, and this story collection in particular. They couldn't have been more on target. He is such an engaging writer, and even though the subject matter of these stories isn't quite your everyday stuff, the stories are tremendously human (and often humane), and really pack both a literary and an emotional punch. I'll definitely be picking up some of Appel's other books, but in the meantime, I highly recommend you pick this collection up.

That I LOVE. So refreshing to see glimpses of these characters being themselves in such depth of context to their situations. Without the verbose word count hubris of description that has become so endemic in fiction in the last 4 or 5 years, IMHO. If it isn't alternating narrators its long term verbose copy that belongs in a psychiatric session.The only flaw I found for my own reading that in order to be humorous, and all of them WERE (even within reversal or sorrow combined)- is that at times, I felt the \"try too hard\" over the top gimmick became somewhat embedded. But others like that in majority, I guess. Not I. It might be that all the people of my life have been simple people who would never go to such complex connotations. My people would have YOU committed if you were paying $400 a crack for therapy of hedgehog owning, for instance. Metaphors be damned.All of them (stories) are different in slant, which is terrific. And most are 5 star. But as good as they were, there were a couple of times I questioned some aspect of stated \"fact\" at the ending or emotive inference. But we are all different, and different children have a \"different take\" on parental role models. Some siblings, nearly the opposite inference by watching the same thing!! So who am I to question whether visible fighting is good or bad or needed or wanted!Very entertaining and he sure can write. And he knows people are often self-absorbed and finicky in the modern world.As I am a nearly impossible audience for short stories, take this as a 5 star from most anyone else."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "EXCERPT: That year Lizzie's kid sister kept a list of things that were funny when they happenedto other people: tarring and feathering, Peeping Toms, mad cow disease. The rare encephalopathy from which their father suffered didn't actually come from eating infected cattle, it turned out, but from a spontaneous somatic mutation - which Bill Sucram's neurologist described as 'losing the Genetic lottery ' - yet the ailment was enough like mad cow that Lizzie's mother swore off animal products. Overnight Myra Sucram stopped fricasseeing duck and took to ordering exotic soy dishes from a newly opened vegan-kosher deli on Walloon Street. Her family's health consumed her: she spent mornings arguing with Bill'sinsurance carrier, afternoonsresearching manganese contamination and do it yourself dioxin tests at the public library, and evenings promising her husband and daughters that medical breakthroughs can happen overnight. She wore her smile like a shroud. Lizzie's father resigned himself to his diagnosis. He informed the Pontefract Board of Education that he had six months to live and that he did not intend to spend them at the office. Then he composed a list of people who harbored him ill will - a shady plumber he'd sued in small claims court, his estranged step-brother in Las Vegas - and he telephonedeach one to apologize. One night, the thirty-eight year old agnostic middle school principal summoned his daughters to hot cocoa at the kitchen table and announced, \"I fear I've taught you girls too much grammar and not enough forgiveness.\" So Lizzie was mortified, but not unprepared, when her father insisted on taking them to meet the sex offender. THE BLURB: A couple adopts a depressed hedgehog; a stranger shows up, claiming to be the father of a girl's imaginary friend; a woman kidnaps her ex-husband's turtle; a family is evicted from their home, but was it ever really theirs? Heartbreaking and hilarious, the eight stories of Einstein's Beach House examine how we deceive ourselves and others, all to arrive at something far more real.MY THOUGHTS: I loved these stories and will be seeking out more of Mr Appel's works.I tried to limit myself to one story per day as they are so thought provoking, but was not always successful.This is a quirky, eclectic and occasionally dark collection of stories about human nature - mostly about that \"aha!\" moment in our lives, when things become perfectly clear, even if only momentarily. Both Appel's stories and his characters remain with you long after you have finished reading. Highly recommended.Thank you to author Jacob M Appel for providing a copy of Einstein's Beach House for review. All opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own personal opinions.

One story in particular had a twist to it that was refreshing, for me at least and funny in an odd way. The lie they were telling as the truth went in a direction they never expected. Another had me rolling my eyes at one bit, not so much what the character was doing, to each his own and all that, but the way she went about it.. was mentally taking a few steps back from her.I can't really pick a favorite from the bunch... one of those happy rare occasions I loved each and every one.

I won this book in a Goodreads giveaway and I'm happy I did. Each story was better, quirkier and more darkly humorous than the last. The author has a wonderful, and eccentric imagination, and I kept chuckling to myself with the way each story progressed. A depressed hedgehog who is taken by its distraught owner to a pet psychologist; a man who sells tickets to tour 'Einstein's Beach House' after a AAA travel guide mistakenly prints his home on the beach is such the place; and my favorite, titled 'Paracosmos', where a mother and father are worried about their young daughter's imaginary friend and her insistence on her constant presence. Then, the imaginary friend's father shows up at the door one day and he and the mother begin an affair. That one still has me scratching my head in a fantastical way. I look forward to reading more of Jacob Appel's work.Note: the author has some copies of his books available via PDF. Click on his author profile and he gives his email address. I emailed him and he quickly sent me a copy of his other book of short stories which I was able to download to my kindle. Not sure what else he has available but it's worth emailing him.

In \"Hue and Cry,' a young girl confronts her dying father's frailty as he pursues an ideal of forgiveness in the face of public outcry. In 'La Tristesse Des Herrissons,' a couple deals with a depressed pet hedgehog and their own idiosyncrasies. In 'Strings,' a rabbi finds herself entangled in the requests of her former lover, a cellist. In 'Limerence,' a young teen has a crush on an unsuitable young woman, a crush that never quite leaves him as he grows to be a family man. In \"Einstein's Beach House,' a man capitalizes on a typographical error but finds his lies come back to bite him in a neat plot twist. 'The Rod of Asclepius' is Appel's most haunting tale, told by the daughter of a man who seeks revenge for wife's tragic death. 'Sharing the Hostage' is another deranged pet story: a divorcing couple shares custody of their pet tortoise, Fred; the woman's new boyfriend would love to set Fred free. And in 'Paracosmos,' my favorite story of the collection, a lonely young girl has a new best friend whom her parents think is imaginary until the girl's father shows up on their doorstep. What is real and what is not? And what does the answer reveal about them as a family?Many thanks to Jacob Appel for providing me with a copy of this collection of eight short stories to read and review.

Most were comical, yet darkly moving. All were a little strange and dreamlike. Characters look back on strange occurrences during a pocket of time when the world is almost as it seems. Almost. As a people-watcher, I began to notice a pattern with Appel\u2019s writing after reading a few of these stories. As they were introduced, many characters were frozen for a moment and their futures laid out, before being brought back to the present. It highlighted the movement of time, the years flowing by, and the way we all have our own stories, even the minor characters that flit in and out of our lives momentarily. When mentioning this nuance in Appel\u2019s writing, my fianc\u00e9 pointed out that the title of the collection was perhaps thoughtfully chosen; the connectivity of us all and the continuity of time.

The title story was one of the memorable ones -- a transposition of numbers in the address where Albert Einstein spent his summer vacations leads one homeowner to profit off the error, and then, well, I won't say what happens next but it leaves you wondering. La Tristesse\u00a0 des\u00a0 H\u00e8rissons, \u00a0 (Translated: The Sadness of Hedgehogs): In the Steven King book I am currently reading, a high school English teacher offered up that teenagers, after slogging through the required course readings, use three words to describe them:\u00a0 \"This is\u00a0stupid.\"Well, sometimes that critique just fits.\u00a0 Here, a young couple adopt a hedgehog for a pet.\u00a0 It seems depressed; it goes on Prozac prescribed by a psychiatrist.\u00a0 Enough\u00a0 said.\u00a0 I know other reviewers loved this one, so maybe I wasn't in the mood.Also under that category might go the last story,  Paracosmos, a Twilight Zone - ish tale of an imaginary friend whose father shows up at the door. Original, yes! The Rod of Asclepius\u00a0would make for an interesting novel, I thought.\u00a0 Limerence  was pretty good, as was\u00a0 Sharing the Hostage, about a divorcee with visitation rights to her pet tortoise (much funnier than the hedgehog story).\u00a0 I didn't\u00a0 understand many of the story titles and had to look up their meanings.\u00a0 So my vocabulary has been expanded with these words I'll probably never see again in my lifetime, unless I forget those too.\u00a0 Which is likely.\u00a0\u00a0 So some good ones here and at least one stupid one.\u00a0 Better than average overall."}, {"userName": "Jessica Sullivan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246157-jessica-sullivan", "userReview": "Sometimes I struggle with short story collections because they\u2019re unable to hold my attention.

A man posing as a doctor kills innocent patients to avenge his dead wife. A woman has an affair with the father of her daughter\u2019s imaginary friend.There\u2019s your glimpse into the absurdity this short story collection has to offer. But the oddness doesn\u2019t end with Appel\u2019s concepts; he infuses it into all the little details of his stories and the characters who inhabit them. It\u2019s like stepping inside a Todd Solondz movie\u2014a version of the real world in which the strangeness and vulnerability that accompany being human are amplified.As with any short story collection, some stood out above the rest, but they\u2019re all short enough and fundamentally interesting enough to easily power through. There were a few instances in which I felt like the \u201cmeaning\u201d of a story was shoved into my face when it could have been revealed with more careful nuance, but overall I found Appel\u2019s writing to be quite good.I recommend Einstein\u2019s Beach House for all my fellow weirdos out there.Note: Thanks to the author for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6758860-mary", "userReview": "I loved all eight of these deliciously off-kilter stories...They were all emotionally riveting in weird and wonderful ways.

This was a book that I probably would never have noticed simply based on the title, however, I happened to see a review mentioning a couple adopting a depressed hedgehog and found it so intriguing that I had to learn more! Not only does the author, Jacob M. Appel, tackle the subject of a depressed hedgehog, but in this quirky collection of stories, touches on an array of topics, including religion, love, disability & serious health issues, sex, and mental illness, however, portrays in an unconventional manner with a twist. Appel is adept at mixing humor with sadness, and reality with fantasy, blending them in a manner that leaves one pondering long after the story has ended.I would definitely recommend Einstein\u2019s Beach House to anyone who enjoys short stories, especially stories that deviate from the ordinary. I would also recommend to those who typically find short stories boring or uninteresting. There is nothing dull about these stories, and they will give you much food for thought!

Despite the kindness of receiving a free book I'm absolutely candid about the book because I want everyone to know what they're getting as much as I hope to when I'm shopping.Usually when I'm about to review something I go into a prototypical summary/positives/negatives format but in this case I can't really find anything negative to say so I'm stymied for the last third of the review. This is a keen rarity, as my fiancee will vociferously attest, so it means you should pay heed to what I'm about to say.As you might have read in the summary, this is, of course, a short story collection. Each story is very brief and concise making it easily consumed textually but of complex enough content that you can chew on it for hours afterwards. This is the sort of text that on one hand I yearn to pass on to other readers so that they can have a stab at it but at the same time regret letting go of because I know that the contents will haunt my recollections for years to come. Appel touches profoundly on the topics he seeks to address. What is our relationship with animals and with each other? What does it mean to really own a piece of property? How meaningful is the past and what bearing should that have on our future? Appel's very quick vignettes are windows into the human condition and provoke a world of thought and analysis that surpasses their brevity. It has been a long time since so few pages have made such an impression on this seasoned reader.In summary, this is one of the supreme victories of the genre. Not only is it entertaining but also thought provoking in a way that most books simply and completely are not.

Hopes and fears and experiences that start with what seem to be a simple routine, but that expand to some sort of transcendence. All of these are a part of this book, where a fluid writing, a cast of unique characters and several interesting stories promise to give form to a very enthralling read. And it all starts with Hue and Cry, which tells the tale of a man with a genetic disease and of his attempts at trying to take forgiveness to the sex offender that lives near his home. Focused on the perspective of the man\u2019s daughter, this tale mixes the innocence of a young girl with the cruelty of a lifelong judgment. It is also a tale of childhood\u2019s end, and, beautifully written in its somewhat melancholic tone, a strangely touching story. La Tristesse des H\u00e9rissons tells the story of a couple who decides to adopt a hedgehog, only to discover that it suffers of an unusual disease for its kind: depression. Somewhat peculiar, but also quite intriguing, it\u2019s more than a story about a new arrival to the family. It also mirrors the struggles of the relationship between the main characters, showing their personalities and the kind of situations they are willing to accept for each other \u2013 even when that means accepting irrational demands. Also, it\u2019s a story about limits \u2013 as the surprising finale so clearly shows. Strings is about how overwhelming it can be to face the return of someone from the past\u2026 even when he only asks for a couple small favors. Slightly bizarre, but also very enthralling, this is a story that brings the past to the present, shaping it in a different perspective, and placing upon it all hopes and fears. And it is this balance of hope and fear, culminating in a somewhat unexpected finale that makes this tale memorable.Limerence tells the story of a strange relationship. Lena and Jesse are young, their lives couldn\u2019t be more different and, somehow, they still share a strange bond. Intriguing, in its strange fusion of innocence and sadness, this is, above all, a tale about growing up\u2026 and a reminder of how hard that can be.Einstein\u2019s Beach House is about how a mistake in a guidebook leads a man to changing his house history, with considerable financial success\u2026 and subsequent trouble. Also somewhat bizarre, but intriguing from the very first lines, this is a very peculiar tale, and also a very surprising one. Especially since the conclusion is all but what it was expected to be. The Rod of Asclepius is the story of a man that, after the loss of his wife, decided to take a trip to the hospital. Or several. Mysterious and enthralling, this is as much a tale of innocence as of grief and its unexpected consequences. Narrated by a six year old girl \u2013 at the time of the events \u2013 it casts a different perspective of what his father is doing. And that makes the story much more intriguing. And much sadder. Sharing the Hostage is about a turtle-napping and a relationship where everything is strange. Also somewhat bizarre, but intriguing in it strangeness, this tale shows, in all its peculiarity, the sacrifices a man is \u2013 or is not \u2013 willing to make to keep a relationship. Overall, a funny, light read. Paracosmos tells the story of a lonely girl and her unusually complex imaginary friend. Both intriguing and somewhat sad, this tale is also a bit strange, but strangely enthralling. It keeps you wonder about what\u2019s truly happening with Eve and, at the same time, casts a different shadow about the definition of make believe. Eight fascinating stories, bizarre in their essence, but beautifully written. Such is, in the end, the essence of this book. And, with its strange \u2013 but strangely enthralling \u2013 characters, situations and conclusions, this quite brilliant selection of stories could never be any less than memorable.

They\u2019re written in clear, unassuming, even humble prose. They\u2019re often laugh-out-loud funny, so that one may get the impression one is embarking on an entertaining lark, a little amusing anecdote to pass the time. Here\u2019s the thing, though: Appel is a highly disciplined writer with an incisive understanding of what makes for powerful short fiction. Each story in the collection delivers a hard-hitting, unified effect that is nothing short of devastating. These are stories built to be read from beginning to end in a single sitting. These are stories in which big things happen, things that have real consequences on complex, vividly believable characters. Appel never takes refuge in false effects, or in the vague incrementalism that is the all-too-common scourge of so much of contemporary short fiction. His characters are engagingly plausible, like alternative versions of our own selves.For short fiction aficionados who may be discouraged by much of what they\u2019re reading in literary magazines, this collection is a bracing antidote. Every single story is strong, but my favorites are \u201cLimerence,\u201d \u201cSharing the Hostage,\u201d and \u201cParacosmos.\u201d Highly recommended!"}], "description": "A couple adopt a depressed hedgehog; a mother is seduced by the father of her daughter's imaginary friend; a man kidnap's his ex-wife's pet turtle.
