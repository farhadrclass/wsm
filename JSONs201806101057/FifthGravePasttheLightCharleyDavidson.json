She confronts a clients nasty husband, she is confronted by questions from the police, she's forced into therapy, her room is filled with blonds, she has a horrible life/death experience and Reyes is just down the hall in all his pure hot steamy sexyness. No, that is not all of it just the holy crisps parts for me. The best was of course Reyes just down the hall, va va voom ! The worst, the bridge. I will have nightmares of that rusty evil place. Reyes, Holy Hot Tamales warmed in fire is he hot in this book. He takes his romantic side out from under the bed and hangs it out for us to enjoy. if you didn't lust/love him before,(you're crazy? LOL) you will after this. He gives Charley, his attention, his heart ?, gives her security, gives her comfort, gives her food and trust. He really shocked me with his total devotion to giving it all. Reyes has opened hi security wall and let her in. He asks her at one point to let him in and the result is spine tingling ! His line at the end, he got the last words (don't you go and peek it will ruin the book) was WOW, oh Double WOW...Ms. Jones pulled a meanie by ending it right there. I forgive her, kind of. She wrote a fabulous entertaining story that had me giggling, swooning, sweating and crying and even praying. What a ride, I think my arse is sore from all the bumps, thrills and hard turns.I do love him, I do.

But it's never anything as simple as just a serial killer case for Charley...there's an arsonist that just may or may not be her sexy neighbor, Reyes, and a whacked out cheating husband that she has to set up!Okay, so things never change with Charley. Yes, the case with the blonde women was really intriguing. I really enjoyed how everything set up. The twist with the whacked out husband was a bit of a surprise...I didn't see that one coming...and neither did Charley unfortunately! In the end, it was great the way she was able to handle things. But I just can't go on about the cases when there's someone so much better to talk about! You guessed it...the super yummy REYES!! ~sigh~ But in this book, we get a deeper look at Reyes and if you're paying attention, there are all kinds of clues! (hint: C and R Industries...I LOVE that!) And the sticky notes...Reyes is sooo romantic ~ who would've thunk? Seriously, the man is such a planner...it's amazing to see all the things that he has done. Of course, it helps to have all his abilities but still. And he's a provider and he takes care of the people he loves....sometimes to Charley's detriment. But even that is forgivable. I am a bit concerned about where this is headed. I want to have good positive thoughts about their relationship and I was very happy with the info that Garrett came up with. But...I just don't want them to fizz out. I know, I know what you're thinking...it couldn't possibly happen with Reyes and Charley but it does happen - all. the. time. I guess we'll all just have to keep our *fingers crossed*. Speaking of Reyes and Charley, how did you like that ending? And if you haven't read it...what are you waiting for? The ending is to die for! Short and sweet and sooo to the point! OMG...I really don't want to wait an entire year! P.S. Please forgive me for not addressing all our favorite other characters...they are great and wonderful and so much fun in the story. You will really enjoy them....as usual.

'You would still feel pity for me?' He nipped at my earlobe. The small amount of pain caused a sharp spike of arousal. 'I am a monster, Dutch. A demon. Unworthy of you.'\"I previously claimed to hate erotica. Did I really mean that? Nooooooooo. Not when Reyes is involved. Give me more of that shit.Saying Charley Davidson is an interesting character is saying Homer Simpson's a little bald, or Mr. Burns is a little evil. It's a wee bit of an understatement. Here, we have our fifth installment of the Charley Davidson series, and I am so happy to say that Darynda Jones did not let me down (Hear that, Richelle Mead? Sometimes a formula works for a reason. Don't mind me, I'm just a little bitter over Gameboard of the Gods).There is a fine, fine...I'd say 0.1mm fine line between a character's snark that separates it from humor to dislikeable bitchiness. For me, Charley's brand of sarcasm and smartassery leans far towards the side of enjoyable. There was not a single page that did not make me think, that did not make me smile. More often than not, I laughed. Charley's character and personality will not be to everyone's taste. Some will find her irredeemably annoying; her tendency of making a joke out of everything will get on their nerves. I am not one of those people. I absolutely loved Charley in the previous books, and my unabashed worship of her continues through to this latest installment in this immensely enjoyable series. If you liked Georgina in the Succubus Blues series, let me just say, Charley is Georgina on steroids. It is snark to the extreme, and you know what? I love it.Charley Davidson, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love her humor.I love her foolhardiness style and her brave front during dangerous situations. It's not TSTL when it's our Charley Davidson. Never call her that.I love her complicated relationship with Reyes.\"I closed my eyes, tried to stop the flood of lust that rushed between my legs. Our relationship was a lot like underwear in a dryer without a static control sheet. One minute we were floating through life, buoyant and carefree. The next we were attached at the crotch.\"I love her habit of naming everything.\"Then I saw his shower. And I knew the true meaning of happiness. Two minutes later, I was thoroughly enjoying a massage beneath a waterfall made of stone and marble. I named this ingenious invention George and decided to leave my own shower, Hector, for him. Some loves were just meant to be.\"I love that beyond her tough as a nut exterior, she's got a heart that's softer than my Pillow Pet (a Love Puppy, for those who are curious).I love her unashamed sexuality.Reyes. Good god, that man will be the death of me. He may be the son of the devil, but he oozes sexuality. And his taste in books? FUCKING FLAWLESS, PEOPLE.\"Scattered on the floor was everything from George R. R. Martin and Tolkien to Ursula Le Guin and Asimov. He was a reader. And he liked fantasy and science fiction. It was like he was created for me and me alone.\"IF CHARLEY DOESN'T WANT HIM. I'LL TAKE HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Me and the other 97.5% of readers, male and female, on Goodreads. I can hardly imagine a more tortured (literally and figuratively), complicated, humanly inhuman character than Reyes. His singleminded devotion to the often frustratingly pigheaded Charley is beautiful to read and swoonworthy in every sense of the word. And make no mistake, if anyone can be pigheaded, it's Charley. She's not perfect. She frustrated me at times with some pretty stupid lines of thinking. I mean...you fell in love with the son of the devil who's done all sorts of atrocious things in order to survive and you're worried about the fact that he could possibly be an arsonist? Priorities, my dear Charley. You no haz them.The plot is interesting, the mysteries episodic, like in other books, Charley is in the middle of her own case as well as pursuing other leads as ghosts appear in her life. The plot unfolds at a natural pace, doesn't jump around from A to Q to D, and never left me confused. The other characters have their cameos, Charley's dad, Uncle Bob, Angel, Cookie...etc. The recurrent cast is there, and they are delightful. The writing is spectacularly funny. You know how you can kind of tell in what mental state a person is in while reading a sample of their writing? Well, I can't imagine how much sugar Darynda Jones must have consumed while writing this, but whatever it is, I'd be happy to do my share, and show her my love and appreciation for this continued series by sending her a dozen cream-filled donuts. Do I gush? Yes, I do. Because this book deserves to be gushed over.Now, when's the next book coming out?"}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "My rating: 4.5 of 5 starsA copy of Fifth Grave Past the Light was provided to me by St. Martin's Press for review purposes.'The dead guy at the end of the bar kept trying to buy me a drink.

He was a pretty famous moonshiner, actually.\"\"My dad's pretty famous too.\" We all turned to stare at Reyes.This series never disappoints and has gotten better and better with each installment. Charley Davidson is one of my all-time favorite female leads: she's hilarious and snarky and totally badass but not in excess. And if Charley is one of my favorite female leads, Reyes definitely earns a spot on my favorite male leads. Fair warning, the steamy is in abundance in this installment! And oh my GOSH that ending! Not quite a cliffhanger but definitely leaves a smile on your face and makes you infinitely anxious for the next book.\"No, your other - Fuck, how many boyfriend's do you have?\"\"Including Herman, the maintenance guy at the Jug 'N Chug who talks to celery?\" If I didn't know better, I could've sworn Reyes ground his teeth.

This installment really spoke of the future development, the purpose and the potential of Charley Davidson. Darynda Jones has been slowly maturing and expanding on Charley's character taking her past the snarky girl that we've all grown to love and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing where she continues to take it.

Some things I loved about Fifth Grave Past the Light: 1.) Reyes. So.much.more.Reyes.2.) We find out a lot more back story about Charley, Reyes, Heaven, Hell, and what they will have to face in the future.3.) The mystery with the dead girls had a little more twist to it than previous mysteries. I totally fell for it. I like when things surprise me!4.) I want sooooo bad for Ubie and Cookie to get together. It's going the speed of molasses, but it's progressing. Slowly.5.) Quentin. I seriously melt whenever he shows up. I'm totally Team Quentin and Amber.6.) THAT ENDING. I may have shed a tear or two.

It didn't matter what the problem was, they saw only three solutions to it: food, sex, war.\nbecause if you don't, he might start a warI love Charley! I can relate to all of her snark and some of her silliness. (Luckily, none of her almost-getting-killed, constantly-being-beat senseless.) She names everything - all of her body parts, car, furniture, even her shower (Hector). I have a pillow that I sleep with that I named Phil, so I get it. My husband is totally jealous of Phil. Whatevs, if he wasn't as hot as a the surface of the sun when he sleeps, maybe I'd cuddle him instead of Phil.

They are climbing walls, getting in Hector with her, hanging from the ceiling, and refusing to talk to her.

This unexpected display of real human emotions has caused an uproar in all of New Mexico. Female residents of Albuquerque have stopped all their activities and rushed to witness this miracle. Traffic has yet to return to normal. Darlings, if you liked Reyes before now, by the time you finish Fifth Grave Past the Light, you are going to be hopelessly in love, but don\u2019t worry your pretty little heads over it. You won\u2019t be alone in your misery. I always thought Reyes was too otherworldly and untouchable to serve as a proper book boyfriend, but in Fifth Grave, Darynda really took him a step further. She took him well past his usual glowering and threatening and added humor and just a touch of vulnerability. The end result is a more human, approachable Reyes, finally Charley\u2019s match not just in otherworldly matters (and, ummm, in bed), but in day to day things as well. \nHe quirked a brow. \u201cHow would you like your eggs?\u201dI tried. I really did. But I glanced at his crotch and it came out anyway. \u201cFertlized?\u201d\nI dare say that Fifth Grave represents a turning point for this series, and I\u2019m very hopeful Darynda will keep threading the road she took. We are finally offered some real answers about the nature of Charley\u2019s powers, a progress has been made between her and Reyes, and things are coming together exactly as they should. That\u2019s not to say life with Charley is about to become boring, though. She is still a huge magnet for trouble, and she still handles things in her usual hilarious manner, but under slightly different circumstances. The old gang is still in full swing, but some new characters are introduced as well, two of them very promising and I hope we\u2019ll see more of them in future installments. I\u2019m not a fan of love triangles, but I love the situation that is slowly forming between Cookie, Garrett and Uncle Bob. Cookie deserves all the male attention she can get. Darynda and Charley have warmed my heart and forced me to laugh myself into stitches more times than I can count. Both of them deserve their extremely loyal fanbase, of which I am a proud member.

Sincerely, I have massive amounts of affection for her.I wish she\u2019d be my friend. We could get drinks together, gossip about people (both alive and dead), maybe smoke a little pot together in our pajamas and then pass out watching Rick & Morty.She\u2019s just honestly one of my favourite female characters.And really, you don\u2019t even need to read this series from the beginning to get into it, (but it does help.) You can jump in whenever and immediately know Charley. Because her voice and her personality are clear and genuine from the beginning. Darynda Jones has her figured out and never wavers from that truth.This time around Charley is dealing with a lot. And it starts from page one. A cheating husband, gun fire, being confronted by the police about how exactly she manages to solve cases the way that she does. Not to mention, her apartment is filled with dozens of dead blonde women who may, or may not, have been killed by serial killer. They are the worst houseguests too \u2013 climbing her walls (literally), hanging from the ceiling (literally), straight up ignoring her requests to communicate but then also getting in the shower with her. Like you do.Speaking of her apartment, Reyes has somehow managed to move in right next door by surprise. How convenient. Full disclosure, I\u2019m not the biggest fan of Reyes. Actually, I mildly loathe him. He comes across as possessive, threatening, glowering and mildly abusive. And hey, maybe some readers are into that and find the whole smoldering do it because I said so schtick to be super sexy. But I do not. No man of mine would ever dare threaten to not help me in a time of dire need unless I did a striptease for him. Fuck off, Reyes.In this new installment in the Charley Davidson saga, Reyes is given a touch of humour, a bit of humanity, of vulnerability. That much I will admit. Some of his otherwordly douchebagness is stripped away, perhaps to make him more palpable as boyfriend material. Objectively, fans of Reyes with definitely love this installment.But I\u2019ve never totally gotten it. Charley is just too strong in her sense-of-self to be into such a controlling boobpunch. I\u2019m not into this overused plot trope of a strong badass bawse turning into a life-sized dripping vagina whenever a sexy man is around. Everyone knows it\u2019s the vagina that holds the power!The whole \u201cromance\u201d thing doesn\u2019t work for me because at the end of the day he\u2019s still just an abusive dick. And the only thing all that blahblahblah-ing about his abusive upbringing did was make me think \u201coh, the cycle of abuse continues.\u201d I did not feel sorry for him at all.I don\u2019t like who he turns Charley into. Because like I said, I love Charley. Girl is better off without him, in every way. Why does she even like him? Because of his personality? She\u2019s never even mentioned it.As far as I can tell it all comes down to some mystical bullshit magnet between them and her uncontrollable lust for him because he\u2019s sooo sexxyyy *barf*. If he were to spend a whole book farting and running away with explosive diarrhea, Charley would find a way to explain how sexy it was and why she just can\u2019t control her sexual desire when he lets it rip. The whole thing comes across as pretty surface \u201clove.\u201dSneaky, devilish little shithead.But I digress, because despite my loathing of Reyes there was a lot of good stuff in this book. A little more information of Charley\u2019s purpose on Earth, for one. Non-stop action! The serial killer angle was super engaging and I love that Bob is into Cookie. Plus, my favourite: a cliffhanger ending!Honestly, this might have been my favourite book in the series so far. I can only hope and pray to the gods I don\u2019t believe in, that Charley comes to her fucking sense about Reyes.And maybe some of you readers too. Seriously \u2013 he\u2019s awful.

So for now, I'm giving it 2.5 stars. However, I may or may not change it to 3 stars once I'm not quite so pissed off. I do think fans of Reyes, and the series in general will love Fifth Grave. Unfortunately for me, I LOATHE Reyes, and he was the main reason I wasn't impressed with Fifth Grave.Random ranty thoughts:-I couldn't take Charley and Reyes's relationship seriously. Not when all it seemed to consist of was 1. Charley feeling lusty for Reyes if he so much as moved 2. Charley being in awe of Reyes's sexy body and 3. Charley fangirling over Reyes every time she saw him or thought about him. Where was the depth? It was all so shallow.-I hated Reyes. I don't care how fuckable or sexy he was meant to be, he was still an abusive bastard. I was so sick of Reyes constantly threatening Charley - that's how abusers act towards there victims. I wouldn't be surprised if Reyes became a wife beater.-Yes, lets all just forget about Reyes using Charley as bait and getting her tortured by a sadistic fucker. Was there any mention of Reyes doing that? No, it was brushed under the carpet and instead we had Charley and co gushing about how sexy and protective he was of her, and how Reyes was such a hero. BULLSHIT. Him saving Charley a few times doesn't erase the fact that he knowingly put her life in danger. What kind of man puts the woman he's meant to love in the crosshairs of a rapist fucker? How was that swoony? How was that showing how much he loved Charley? How was that romantic?Reyes has never properly apologised or redeemed himself or shown any remorse or guilt about what he did, and the suffering Charley went through. Why? Because he didn't care about Charley or her feelings. He wasn't bothered that she suffered. If the author wanted me to believe otherwise then the whole event shouldn't have been forgotten about after a lame, insincere apology from Reyes. And not only that, Charley should stop banging on about how heroic Reyes is and she should stop acting like Reyes has only ever protected her - I'm not buying that bullshit. I need to see Reyes redeeming himself through his actions and dialogue \u2014 him suddenly acting heroic or Charley shoving Reyes's heroics down my throat isn't going to convince me of Reyes worthiness. He needs to do that himself.-I'm sick of Reyes throwing hissy fits. Calm the fuck down, and act like an adult.-Reyes wanted Charley to use the key to his flat, he wanted them to be close and by the end he was proposing to her yet the fucker couldn't even tell Charley he'd gotten a job working for her dad. WTF?! How can he want to share a life with her when he can't he even tell her about his new job? All he did was lie, hide things and manipulate Charley. Yet he still wanted to get married to her. WTF?!-How was Reyes so sexually experienced? He wasn't with anyone as a teen and then he was in prison for 10 years. Was his experience from his demon life or something? I wonder if he was sexing up loads of women after he saw and supposedly fell madly in love with celestial-Charley. Oh and utensil sex. Really?-I was so pissed when Charley threatened Rocket and his fragile sister because her pwecious demon boyfriend might die. So what if he did die? His incorporeal self would still be alive. Also, he deserves to die, he's a demon and he must have murdered millions and committed loads of disgusting crimes. The respect I had for Charley's character seriously plummeted after she cruelly bullied and threatened two vulnerable and mentally unwell ghosts. What a horrible self-centered cow.-Why the fuck did idiot Gemma blab to a complete stranger about Charley being supernatural?! Is there anyone that doesn't know about Charley's powers?! WTF?! How have the demons not found and killed Charley yet?-WTF is with the synopsis? Gemma was never in any danger. And Charley only suspected she was for all of 5 minutes at the very end. So yea, WTF?!-When Charley called Reyes for help because she thought her sister was in danger, instead of supporting, reassuring and helping Charley, that wanker Reyes blackmailed her and said he'd only help Gemma if Charley promised him sexual favours. Wow, what a gentlemen, the woman he supposedly loves was in fear for her sister's life but did the fucker try to calm her fears or help her without first getting something out of it? No. He didn't give a fuck about Charley's feelings, he wanted her scared and he wanted power over her. The dick.-I'm not convinced AT ALL of Reyes's love for Charley. Him being horny and murdering for her doesn't equal love. He didn't trust her with the simplest things, he kept important information from her, and he was always threatening to hurt her. Where was the love? The only genuine feelings of love he had was for his sister. Other than that, there was nothing. -Where the fuck was the million dollars Reyes owed Charley? He still didn't give it to her! Or were the various buildings he bought in Charley's name meant to be payment? I'm presuming he spent her million on the warehouse and the building she lives in. Who the bloody fuck did he think he was doing that?! He had no right to decide how she should spend HER money. He should have given her the money she was owed instead of assuming he knew what was best for her. Did he not think she could make her own decisions on how to spend her OWN fucking money?! What a bastard. He probably thinks women aren't able to sort out their own finances and investments. The sexist pig.-Why did Reyes take so long to tell Charley that he bought that warehouse where Rocket lived? He knew she visited Rocket regularly so WTF? The dick must have kept it a secret so he could make things difficult for her. Nice.-Where the hell was Reyes when Charley was nearly raped and killed?! I thought he sensed when she was in danger. Did he ignore her? Could he not be bothered?-I guess I was meant to sympathise with Reyes over his abuse but I didn't, not one bit. All I kept thinking of was all the abuse and threats he issued out to Charley ever since he met her. -I was sick of Reyes's fucking beauty. He even had fangirls and websites dedicated to him. His good looks and abusive behaviour was all there was to him. A sure sign of a two dimensional hero is one where he becomes unattractive/undesirable/no-longer-swoony if one imagines him to be average looking.-The serial killer/murdered women/girls mystery was engaging up until the reveal at the end \u2014 it was all so anti-climactic. -What's taking Bob so long to ask Cookie out? Maybe he wants to sleep around first or something? The douche.-Good: Charley wasn't whiny or self-pitying but her upbeat attitude and constant humour did grate. If she toned it down a notch, she'd be far more tolerable.-Good: Getting more information on Charley and Reyes's purpose on Earth. -Good: Garrett stabbing Reyes. It was beautiful.-Good: Bob and Charley's relationship. So much better than Charley's relationship with her useless bastard dad.-Good: I loved Rocket, Angel and SS/Strawberry. They were brill. It was so funny when SS used a toilet brush to comb Charley's hair.-Good (sort of): Reyes's case been bought up at the end. I'm actually interested to know about his real parents. Are they even his \"real\" parents? He's the son of Satan so his earthly family aren't really his true family. He existed thousands of years before them and he's older them, so they really shouldn't be all that important to him especially since they didn't raise him. It'll be daft if he does think of them as his parents because hasn't he been born on earth numerous times before? So he must have dozens maybe hundreds of \"birth\" parents. Does he still think of all of them as his parents? If not, then his \"birth\" parents this time around shouldn't mean that much to him either. So yea, I'm interested in Reyes and his so called family.All in all, I wasn't impressed - Reyes pissed me off way too much."}, {"userName": "Rowing", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5960209-rowing", "userReview": "More Charley???

I'm so excited to read what Charley's response will be!I'm on the fifth installment of this series, and I swear, I'm not exaggerating when I say that it just keeps getting better and better. When I read book 4, I thought to myself, \"Oh, this book is the best in the series. Surely, nothing can top this.\" but then I read this one, and I was taken aback, because it was...much better. The unconventional relationship between our female lead (Charley Davidson, a.k.a. the Grim Reaper) and our male lead (Reyes Alexander Farrow, a.k.a. the Son of Satan) never ceases to amaze me. And in this book, we see their relationship evolve and gain serious momentum (still with a dose of hilarity and sarcasm c/o Charley). I'm so pleased that Reyes is now more open to Charley - yes, there were still secrets we discovered later on that are pretty shocking - but it was a significant leap from the Reyes who used to be as closed off as an oyster. What I particularly love about Reyes is that he is always faithful to Charley. He never once looked at another woman, because in his words (to Charley), \n\"Nothing and no one interests me besides you.\"\n He protects her at all costs (Charley would probably be dead by now if he doesn't have a lovesick supernatural being guarding her ass since she was a baby). But make no mistake, Charley is not a damsel in distress, she's got a lot of spunk, I tell you (it's just that she can be crazy sometimes and lures danger into herself). It was really surprising to know that Reyes has a sweet bone in his body, and I was swooning over the moon when he told Charley, \n\"We should date.\"\n I didn't even recognize the love-struck Reyes who said these lines:\n\"I want you, Dutch, body and soul. I want you in my bed every night. I want you there when I wake up in the morning. I want your clothes strung across my apartment and your scent on my skin.\"\nNow, I know it's not that romantic and maybe he could have inserted more poetic words in it for our liking, but if you were reading this series since book 1, then you know that those lines were rich coming from Reyes. Heck, to me, it's equivalent to a marriage proposal already, and if I were Charley, I would have been jumping up and down while shouting \"Yes!\" like a mad woman.It's also funny to see these two confident supernatural beings feel a spark of jealousy: Reyes getting jealous over Garrett and Donovan (and he would have broken their spines and killed them already if not for Charley) and Charley getting jealous over the other women swarming Reyes like flies (and while Reyes is well aware of his effect on these women, he all but ignores them, because he only has her eyes on Charley).So there, you've met my favorite couple. An odd pair, yes, but they match perfectly, and they are the main reason why I love this series (other than the fact that Charley and her sarcastic lines are my ultimate happy pill). If you haven't read this series, and if you have a dry sense of humor like I do and don't mind a story about grim reaper, son of Satan, dead people (lots of them, some may even be naked), demons, and solving murder mysteries, then you should give this series a try."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8629852-christina", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Mersina Seena", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2875657-mersina-seena", "userReview": "And now I need to wait 7 months and 28 days until the next installment. 240 days. 5760 hours. 20736000 seconds.

But before I do, I want to share my feelings with the world...The number you have called if currently unavailable because the owner is lying dead on the floor due to too much fangirling and crying and generally going crazy over this awesome book. Please try again when the next book is published, because until then she will remain in this state...Yup, that about covers it... HOLY BANANAS, I don't know how she does it, but Darynda Jones keeps blowing my mind, rocking my world, and reducing me to a begging-for-the-sequel kind of girl. Not that I mind of course *grins* And what's best? The series keep getting better and better! You know that sometimes a series starts out great and then as more books get published the series slowly dies? Well, I can assure you that this series is that polar opposite of that. Every single thing about this book was amazing and like I said, this gives a new definition to the word \"awesome\".~Well, by now, we all know Charley. Strong, independant, sassy as they come, awesome as a person (well, actually, a grim reaper) can be and the best detective in town! She is smart, she is loyal, but above all, she is real. What I absolutely LOVE about Charley is that she is not one of those badass girls that feel no fear and feel no pain and can do no wrong. *yawns sarcastically* She is a person, and even though she has those extraordinairy powers, she can be broken, she does feel pain and lonliness and fear and yet, she must be one of the strongest characters I've ever know. That's how things are and she is not afraid to admit it or to ask for help. She is who she is, she is proud of it and she is ready to face any challenges. Well, along with a healthy dose of sarcasm and sass that is :D It would take a miracle to solve this case. Luckily, I believed in miracles. No, wait, that was testicles. I believed in testicles.We were so screwed.And sometimes it's like you push a button and BOOM!It's hilarious to witness and it makes my day every single time. Oh and let's not forget her hating everything that has to do with early mornings and absence of coffee makes her a kindred spirit :DI\u2019m not 100 percent certain, but I think my cup of coffee just said, \u201cYou\u2019re my bitch.\u201d\u2014STATUS UPDATENever underestimate the power of a woman on a double espresso with a mocha latte chaser high.\u2014T-SHIRT.Enter Reyes, aka Son of Satan, aka sex on a stick. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that I wanted to lick a (book) guy's abs that bad in a loooooong time :D Damn that boy is hot, he has qualities *ahem* and he knows how to use them *ahem x2*A huge smile spread across his face. \u201cTrue enough. So what\u2019s eating you? Because, sadly, it\u2019s not me.\u201d\u201cKeep up, mister, or before you know it, life will pass \u2014\u201d I squeaked when he stepped inside and drew me against his chest \u2013 the airbrushed one \u2013 then bentdown to nibble on my neck. An electric current shot down my spine before I came to my senses. \u201cHey, wait,\u201d I said, pulling back, \u201cyou are the son of Satan. Maybe we need a safe word.\u201dHis grin morphed into something wickedly charming. \u201cOkay, how about, \u2018Oh, my god, it\u2019s so big.\u2019 \u201dAnd yet, he is so... so... so infuriating! My God, sometimes I wanted to crawl inside the pages of the book, grab him by the collar and slap some sense into him... or kiss some sense into him... or... ughhh, okay, back to the review now... I understood where he stood (huh, that sounds weird if you read it outloud), but still! But then, he has those moments and says those things that make you go all make you go all gooey inside and you just can't be agry anymore... All you want to do is grab his face and kiss him until both of you are blue in the face!\u201cOh, my god, I don\u2019t know. What do you want?\u201d\u201cYou,\u201d he said, his voice lowering an octave. \u201cI want you, Dutch, body and soul. I want you in my bed every night. I want you there when I wake up in the morning. I want your clothes strung across my apartment and your scent on my skin.\u201dI also love (as usual of course) all the characters that are involved in the story. Ubie and Cookie are amazing, Amber and that mini-hot guy Quentin, everyone is just so damn amazing! And while reading the book, you get that warm feeling of belonging, because in a way, you belong to their family for just a little while. And trust me, it's one of the most amazing feelings in the world!And lets not forget the cases that Charley is solving while dealing with everything and everyone. Each one has its own little story and its own little magic, and it's like you live in different worlds at the same time: the read world and the magical world of Charley! Plus, I think they caused me a heart attack once or twice... And that last case... I didn't know whether to be scared or start crying... That was when I really got how stong Charley really is, and at that moment I really admired her. Because she was really extraordinairy...But, in order to lighten the mood a little bit, lets all remember all those times (yes, I've lost count by now) when Charley says something so freaking awkward and embarassing that even the reader wants to crawl under a rock and then die...He drew in a deep breath and tried again. \u201cH-he only hits on women who are more s-substantial than you.\u201dOh, that wasn\u2019t offensive at all. \u201cI have depth. I\u2019ve read Proust. No, wait, that was Pooh. Winniethe- Pooh. My bad.\u201dSeveral patrons dived behind the bar while a couple of the offduty cops tackled Tidwell and Cookie to the ground. Tidwell would not be a happy camper. Cookie would enjoy every moment of being groped by a hot cop. She was such a hussy.\u201cI don\u2019t know. You just seem different now. Distant. Like you have PTSD.\u201dI knew from where I spoke. My TSD got P\u2019d when I was tortured by a monster named Earl.I don't even know how the author comes up with those lines... :D:DAnd finaly (yes, I'm getting there!), the final scene... I think I am still in denial... DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN! Because if it did, I think I might just die of joy. It's just too much to handle...And as much as I'd love for that to actually happen, I just can't see it! I mean there's just too much... and then those two... but everyone else... Jesus, that's it, I need that next book pronto!!So, all in all, I give it a 6 stars out of 5, and I can now officially annunce that this series is my new drug :D*****\u201cOh,\u201d Cookie said, caught off guard, \u201cI\u2019ll take a whiskey sour.\u201dTeri winked and began practicing her magic.\u201cA whiskey sour?\u201d I asked Cook.Cookie stared ahead as though standing before a firing squad. \u201cLiquid courage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seemed like a good idea at the time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what they said about nuclear energy on Three Mile Island.\u201dShe cast me a horrified look.Several patrons dived behind the bar while a couple of the offduty cops tackled Tidwell and Cookie to the ground. Tidwell would not be a happy camper. Cookie would enjoy every moment of being groped by a hot cop. She was such a hussy.I closed my eyes, tried to stop the flood of lust that rushed between my legs.

I can't bring myself to switch and read instead; damn fine narration job by Lorelei King.

I really can't say enough about how much I'm enjoying this series; the characters are fabulous-developed really well; the relationships are fascinating and complex; each story is fabulously intense as well humorous at times.
