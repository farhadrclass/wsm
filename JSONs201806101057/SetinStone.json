It took a while for me to get into it, but I am glad I persisted. I needed the context to get an idea of the characters and their history, for the subsequent events to make sense. More than a great side read.One feels like this is an autobiography of a surburban family's life. The vengeful, spiteful, jealous relative, who feels a sense of entitlement. The difficult teenager and rather supportive friend.It brings to mind thst one never really knows what goes on behind closed doors and not all family members wish each other well.I really like the authors style of writing and she had made a \"ordinary\" surbubian life interesting. Particularly when it makes you wonder if you the participants in this tale, how would you react/respond to the events taking place. Are some aspects of the tale pertinent to you and your family?A very British story, with a twist."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13060256-elaine", "userReview": "This is the second Catherine Dunne that I have read just lately, the other being Something Like Love. This is a much darker read, a psychological family drama that is really quite chilling.The Grahams are just a normal family like any other, nothing out of the ordinary about them at all although what I did find to be a refreshing change is the portrayal of the son Ciaran who, unlike in a lot of family dramas, is not a perfect angel. He is a teenager who could be best described as a \"rebel without a cause\" - really nice one minute, then moody, ratty and horrible the next. He will probably be recognised instantly by a lot of readers who are parents. The Grahams' normal every day existence is threatened by the proverbial black sheep of the family who decides it is time to come home and take what he believes is rightfully his in a plan that has been carefully and painstakingly thought out. It is most definitely a question of revenge being a dish best served cold. The plot is well crafted and builds at a good pace, getting more and more sinister as it unfolds and develops into a real page turner.For part of the read I did start to wonder if I was reading a sequel, as a lot of the story is told in flashback, but I soon got used to that and as the book goes on, all the background information that I needed came out in the wash eventually. The characters are well drawn and believable, some nice and some just pure evil. Dialogue is good and feels natural.All in all, a really good read."}, {"userName": "Allanah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68573879-allanah", "userReview": "I really liked this book, the plot was awesome. I got lost in the novel at first as it was so hard to keep up with where it was going but at the end, it all came together well and I understood what happened in the overall book. By the end of the novel I couldn't believe what had happened as the story line was that great and that intense. It's a novel I didn't want to put down but wanted to continue reading. The plot was not something I had come across in other books which I liked as it made it quite unique and stand out from others that had been written. The little blurb on the front 'Every family has its secrets. Most are best left alone...' really caught my attention as I thought it was intriguing and definitely knew from the get-go that I would have to purchase that book. Overall, I'm very pleased."}, {"userName": "Steph", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11109307-steph", "userReview": "Finished this book before now but forgot to write the review so have kinda forgot most of it now, it really wasn't that memorable. It had a good story to it with okay characters but it was just a bit slow and unnecessarily prolonged. It tried to hold the pretence of wondering who wise boy and the watcher were but there really was no doubt at who wide boy was and it really didn't matter who the watcher was as he really had no connection with the story as a whole.The ending was disappointing and again pointless to conclude it about the watcher,why would he get the epilogue and not the family who the story revolved around."}, {"userName": "Caddie Hart", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45130679-caddie-hart", "userReview": "Exciting book with anticipation. I figured out what was happening earlier in the book but it did not retract from its excitement. The book does not bring any friends of Lynda to the fore, so you feel her isolation and desperation for others to see what she\u2019s slowly figuring out. I did however feel that the end fell a bit \u2018flat\u2019. It was almost as if the author wanted to rush the ending, perhaps others feel differently. Nevertheless, an enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Vivienne Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62249038-vivienne-robinson", "userReview": "I gave up, I couldn't get into it."}, {"userName": "Fede", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30830880-fede", "userReview": "[Danny caused many annoyances to Lynda and Robert's family, but they were nothing more than this. He claimed he wanted to take revenge, but it was all talk and no actions. Yes, he attacked their house and their garden, what was dearest to them, but, as even they have said, these are all things that can be fixed or bought again. The \"biggest\" thing he did was trying to get their son accused of raping the girl. Yes, it's a big deal, however he was the first one that was not sure that the girl was really going to accuse Ciar\u00e1n. And so, I wonder, what's the point? If you really want to take this great and vicious revenge you always talk about, then you have to do it properly, not by these actions just worthy of a dedicated vandal. I really believed that he was going to do something grater than this.

Una bella casa in un quartiere benestante di Dublino, la sicurezza economica, due figli invidiabili, Katie e Ciar\u00e0n. Nonostante qualche nuvola passeggera e qualche preoccupazione legata al comportamento un po' aggressivo del figlio adolescente, i Graham vedono scorrere la loro esistenza placidamente, riflessa nel giardino giapponese che ogni mattina all'alba Lynda si ferma qualche attimo a contemplare con l'orgoglio dell'artista. C'\u00e8 solo un neo in questo perfetto quadro famigliare: si tratta di Danny, il fratello minore di Robert, uno scapestrato che periodicamente sconvolge la loro routine con le sue pretese e i suoi modi prepotenti. Per fortuna, nella casa dei Graham arriva una persona che porta un po' di serenit\u00e0. Ciar\u00e0n infatti presenta ai suoi Jon, un amico bello, educato e sensibile, che presto diventa una presenza fissa al punto da trasferirsi da loro. Agli occhi di tutti Jon sembra l'ospite perfetto, forse troppo: l'istinto di Lynda le suggerisce che qualcosa non va... Chi \u00e8 veramente il dolce e disponibile Jon?Dalla trama sembrerebbe un thriller o un noir, ma non \u00e8 n\u00e9 l'uno n\u00e9 l'altro. E' il classico libro che non si riesce ad identificare come genere e lo stile, sebbene impeccabile, non basta a colpirti. La storia poi \u00e8 stiracchiata, in alcuni punti poco credibile: vorrebbe dire che di fronte ad un pericolo, l'amore e i legami familiari diventano pi\u00f9 forti? Non credo e la storia non mi convince in questo senso, i personaggi mancano di spessore e la fine poi delude. E' un libro che non lascia nulla... Niente a che vedere con La met\u00e0 di niente...."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51251683-jennifer", "userReview": "Jon, Ciar\u00e0n\u2019s friend from university, has moved in with the Graham family. He doesn\u2019t have a place to stay now that his parents have separated and he seems to be a good influence on Ciar\u00e0n, who is a typical teenager and doesn\u2019t always get along with his parents.

Danny stole thirty thousand dollars and Robert\u2019s credit cards last time he saw Robert. Now weird things are happening around the house since they started receiving the letters.

She is happily married, with two wonderful children, Ciaran and Katie. She has a beautiful home and garden in one of the most affluent suburbs of Dublin. Her world feels safe and uncomplicated, one she now takes for granted. That is until Jon, a friend of Ciaran's from university - handsome, charming and clever - inveigles his way into their lives. There's something about Jon that Lynda finds unnerving - he is almost too perfect. And her instinct is right: Jon's arrival sets in motion a spiral of events that contributes to the gradual disintegration of all she holds dear. When Jon leaves, his disappearance is even more destructive than his presence. Lynda's quest to track him down reveals unpalatable truths about his past and the reason for his existence in their lives. Lynda knows that Jon is out there somewhere - watching, waiting, malevolent. And she also knows that she must do whatever it takes to protect the most precious thing she has - her family.
