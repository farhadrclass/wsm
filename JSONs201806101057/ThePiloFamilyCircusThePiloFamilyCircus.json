So I can't say this book is going to be for everyone, but if you're looking for something truly different, that's well-written and a bit depraved, then this just might be for you. The setup: Jamie is a bit of a wanker -- a well-meaning guy, but without much ambition or direction in his life. Let's say he's surviving by being spectacularly dull, hoping Fate will leave him the hell alone if he keeps flying under the radar unnoticed, unnoticeable. He then makes a stupendous error in judgment when he spies on some nefarious clown activities late one evening and retrieves a small bag one of them discards and brings it home with him.This act will get him noticed by forces so much worse than Fate -- this act gets him noticed by the Pilo Family Circus and once in its clutches, at the mercy of some pretty deranged and hostile clowns, Jamie will be lucky to escape with his life, let alone his sanity. Once trapped on the circus grounds, he is forced to become a clown and he soon discovers much to his dismay that his clown alter-ego -- J.J. -- is a total dickwad and dangerous to boot. Suddenly Jamie is at war with himself in a twisted, sometimes hysterical battle of wits a la Dr.Jeckyll and Mr.Hyde. I don't want to say much more because the delight in this book is not knowing what the hell is going to happen next."}, {"userName": "seak", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak", "userReview": "I almost hate to recommend this book because ... what does that say about me?The Pilo Family Circus is both completely creepy and absolutely fascinating. If you like clowns, you might change your mind after this. If you already don't like them, you'll probably think I knew it!Jamie almost runs down an odd-looking clown and quickly finds his life changing forever. He has 48 hours to pass his \"audition\" and failing is not an option. With some creativity, he finds himself in a circus that's strange even for circus standards ... and deadly. Monsters lurk in dark corners and out in the open too and you don't even want to mess with the proprietor of the whole thing.Then there are the factions, some of whom absolutely despise each other, such as the Clowns and the Acrobats and what happens in the circus, even a death or two, is overlooked for the most part.Couple the imaginative world-building with a knack for storytelling and a dark sense of humor (you know, where you laugh and cringe at the same time) and you've got a book I couldn't put down.I know I go into sales-pitch mode when I talk about a book I really enjoyed, but this one's highly recommended. The audio on this was astounding too. Mark Stephens does a wonderfully creepy job with his Australian accent. Fishboy alone killed me. This character has a high voice, such as when someone inhales helium, and Stephens stuck it perfectly.This is an unusual book for me to love, but it's a true love. It's different and gruesome and somehow I couldn't put it down. I stayed longer in the car on my drives, I brought headphones to bed when I usual save bedtime reading for my eyes. This is one of those unique books that really stunned me.4.5 out of 5 Stars (very highly recommended)"}, {"userName": "Tressa ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226335-tressa", "userReview": "I don't know if I've ever read such an original story chock-full of so much weirdness, violence, and humor. Yes, humor. The Pilo Family Circus was written by a 19-year-old law school dropout from Australia who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Will Elliott wrote the rough draft in three months, sometimes in sporadic bursts and sometimes in a single sitting resulting in ten thousand words. Pilo was written in times of sleep deprivation, using cabin fever as inspiration, and while he was coming down off anti-psychotic medication. This book is amazing.One late night an Ordinary Joe named Jamie spies three menacing clowns on the street. One throws a bag of something behind a bush, and when Jamie gets it home he discovers some weird beads in the velvet bag. His ingestion of some of the beads gets him visited by three ruthless clowns who vandalize his apartment and leave him a message informing him he has 30 hours to pass his audition or he forfeits his life.Jamie passes his audition when me makes the head clown laugh and is whisked away to the Pilo Family Circus. He is now part of a family of clowns led by the brutal and short-tempered Gonko. Once Jamie puts on the clown paint, his alter ego emerges. J.J. the clown is not an Ordinary Joe, but a psycho who enjoys roughing up carny barkers, menacing the dwarves, and getting a thrill out of murdering the gypsies who travel with the circus. Thus begins the battle between Jamie and J.J. over control of their body, not to mention keeping secrets from each other about a revolution at hand by a small group of carnival workers who yearn to break free from the Pilo Family Circus.The circus is run by Kurt Pilo and his dwarf brother, George. The circus performers include macho but graceful acrobats, evil clowns, and a bitter magician allowed to perform only silly acts like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, which sends him into fits of rage. The freak show is run by Fishboy, and includes Tallow, a thing whose skin melts into rivulets at his feet; a Yeti that is forced to eat glass at every show; and a severed head kept in a glass cage. All freaks were once human, but as punishment by the Pilos were turned into grotesque things by the Master Manipulator.The circus has been around for centuries, putting on shows for tricks\u2014humans attending a normal circus but who stumbled up to the wrong ticket booth. Sometimes the tricks lose their lives due to unforeseen circumstances, but they are the lucky ones. The others who stumble back into the real world had their souls sucked out of them as wages for the performers.The most amazing part of this book is finding out how the circus came into existence, and just who is running the show. Oh, and the clowns have been recruited throughout history to return to the normal world and steer the course of human events in violent ways\u2014e.g. influencing a failed Austrian artist with the initials A.H."}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "Read it!

One drops a small bag containing some suspicious powder. When the coast is clear, Jamie picks it up and brings it home.Well, wouldn\u2019t you?!This little incident of finders keepers brings the clown smack down upon Jamie and his roomie after the two accidentally ingest some of the clown powder. And there\u2019s nothing funny about it. These clowns aren\u2019t the happy go lucky, nose-honking types and they do some unimaginable gross-nasty things to Jamie\u2019s abode. It\u2019s pretty scary what they accomplish in a short span of time and from there on out Jamie\u2019s life gets seriously messed up. Jamie finds this note tucked into the mouth of a dead bat:\u201cSleep tight? Thirty hours to pass your audition. Make us laugh, feller. That\u2019s the assignment. We don\u2019t care how. We don\u2019t care who gets hurt or killed. Make with the chuckles, you pass . . . Gonko, on behalf of the Pilo Family Circus\u201dCreepy, no? Jamie, likely out of fear, does something so oddly funny that the demented clown leader actually laughs. He has passed the \u201caudition\u201d and is now a reluctant apprentice in The Pilo Family Circus. Jamie has no say so in the matter. The clowns are intimidating, persuasive and violently unpredictable. Jamie plays along, foolishly thinking he will make a quick exit from this nightmare as soon as he can. That doesn\u2019t happen. Once the clown paint is slathered upon his face he becomes a new person and JJ the Clown takes over his body. JJ is unpredictable, mean just for kicks and refuses to follow the rules. He\u2019s also a big cry baby which I have to say began to grate on my last nerve after a while. He also wants complete control of \u201cthe body\u201d which was once owned by Jamie.This is a weird ass book about a very twisted circus. The backdrop and the acts that inhabit this bizarre circus are painted with some vivid detail bringing the strange and tormented characters to life in my head. I could easily picture each one and felt especially bad for the once normal people touched by the \u201cmatter manipulator\u201d who turned them into freaks for the sake of the show and were forced to do terrible, painful things to their bodies to entertain the masses. That bit disturbed the most. There are the typical petty jealousies you usually find in a book of this kind, with bad tempered carnies and lots of backstabbing but everything is amplified in this story. I don\u2019t think I liked any of the characters, except for maybe Jamie, but I didn\u2019t get to know him well enough to comment either way. And as much as I would\u2019ve liked to have known more about the clowns, especially Doopy and his bizarre brother Goshy, this book wasn\u2019t about getting all cozy with the characters. It was about the circus and the mayhem The Pilo\u2019s unleashed upon the world. It was an imaginative book with some big ideas that wasn\u2019t nearly as horrific in an in-yer-face sort of way as I\u2019d anticipated. It took some big twists that surprised me but mostly I enjoyed the skewed writing.Here\u2019s a little taste of some of the offbeat descriptive moments and dialogue that litter the story:\u201cGeorge Pilo marched in with someone at his heels, a fat man with eyes so close together it looked like they were sharing a socket.\u201dAnd my personal favorite moment of dialogue:\u201cListen up.

According to my research, this will be the first negative review of a book that won all sorts of weird Australian awards for fiction, and earned a blurb, through no fault of the author -- I understand -- likening this novel to the works of David Lynch and Chuck Palahniuk. I'm here to tell blurbologists that just because a writer smears feces on a wall doesn't make him anything like Chuck Palahniuk. In fact, this is exactly the sort of book that shouldn't be reviewed by anyone. It's not worth it. It is the equivalent of a stack of trade paper copies with the title scrawled in lipstick, featuring a high heeled shoe as the main art on the cover. There is nothing satisfying about this story: it is disjointed, poorly written, the plot fails and the writer relies on some elementary school style transitions (\"Unbeknownst to him, these were the last eight hours of peace he would have for quite some time\"). Not to mention the inexplicable perspective changes, and lack of distinguishable voice. In fact, the only reason I didn't stop reading after 40 pages was because I was eager to find out exactly how bad this book could be. Answer: Pretty awful. Every time I set it down, I forgot what was going on when I picked it up.It's about Jamie, a dude who is basically living in frat boy-style squalor, sharing a crumbling home with some nonfriends. In the middle of the night, he has an interaction with some clowns, which eventually leads to him a role in this otherworldly circus filled with freaks and carnies and a man with a fish face. He is stuck there, after he is shown that the alternative -- his old life -- will never amount to anything. Meanwhile, his body is splitting time: sometimes he is Jamie, sometimes he is JJ, a clown prone to havoc. Blah blah chaos. I have to admit that I feel a little bad dissing on this book so seriously. Obviously these are words made by someone who had the fortitude to get them into print with a pretty awesome cover and a foreward written by Katherine Dunn, a natural pick considering the circus premise. For that, Elliott gets a kudos. You did it, man. Unfortunately, I neither laughed, nor was I frightened throughout the course of the book.

On the one hand, Elliot's technique isn't flawless. He makes mistakes that know-it-all literary types would scoff at, that the average reader could give two shits about. But at the same time, Elliot crafts a tale that is wildly imaginative and utterly enjoyable.So, I give him 4.5 stars, rounded up for the fact that the book is the author's debut novel. Any errors in his craft are minor and probably only caught my eye because I can't help but look for them. They certainly do not detract from an awesome story.The Pilo Family Circus starts with a creepy-menacing atmosphere. Normal guy Jamie encounters two darkly goofy clowns and their much more sinister leader. Through horrifying tactics, the clowns enlist Jamie into their hellish circus.A touch of Killer Clowns from Outer Space and a hint of Night Breed might give you a vague idea what this novel reads like. Elliot presents six clowns, each with various degrees of psychosis and diverse personalities. Gonko, their leader, is sort of like the Joker (Jack Nicholson more so than Heath Ledger), particularly when he's pulling large weapons endlessly out of his pocket (reminds me of when Nicholson's Joker shot down the bat plane). And the clowns talk and act like clowns, even when they are doing the most mundane or murderous things. We never learn Gonko and the other clowns' back stories, which makes you wonder who to sympathize with and who to revile.The clowns are set against an entire circus of original characters filling the roles of traditional circus performers (freaks, acrobats, lion tamer, fortune teller, etc.) Two characters I didn't fully understand were Mugabo the magician and the apprentice, whose name we never learn. I searched for symbolism with these two characters, but if it was there, I missed it. Perhaps they were more plot devices than characters.Anyway, the plot moved, and it kept me reading and entertained. The atmosphere of the book, for me, evolved from chaotic and threatening to eerily sad and hopeless, a transition that was unexpected. I enjoyed Pilo from beginning to end and would recommend it to all fans of modern horror."}, {"userName": "The Behrg", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35009937-the-behrg", "userReview": "Reading the Pilo Family Circus is like being invited to a family reunion with VERY distant relatives. You know the kind. So distant you don't want anyone knowing you ARE family. All you know going in is that some craziness is about to go down. And as much as you expect it, as much as you know it's coming, the insanity that ensues is far more alarming, (and entertaining), than anything you might have imagined.The novel has almost a stream-of-conscience approach to it, with characters moving throughout without what might seem like a through-line or clearcut plot. It makes for a fascinating, if somewhat frustrating, read. With the mythology behind the Pilo Family Circus sprinkled sparsely throughout, it's worth continuing on, if only to see how crazy things can get.While the plot itself may not be the strongest aspect of this novel, the characters certainly shine. From Kurt and George Pilo and their attempts to kill each other, to the clowns and the individuality with which they're imbued, to some of the minor characters, who are equally memorable. In fact, probably the weakest character for me was the one whose story we were following. Jamie / J.J. was difficult to identify with, while the world in which he had been deposited was as fascinating as any world I've encountered.Unlike many books, the flaws in this novel are part of what make it shine.

Elliott has a great sense of humour.I don't want to divulge any plot developments, because you're best going into this one blind. Elliott did a great job of describing the Pilo Family Circus, and I could perfectly visualize it. A lot of writers can bog you down with descriptions to the point where it's near impossible to step back and see the whole picture, but here he uses a perfect balance of descriptive prose, dialogue, and plot movement.If I had any beef about this novel, it would be that I would have liked to explore the histories of Gonko, Goshy, Doopy, Winston, heck, everybody in the circus!A solid 4 stars and recommended."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9822645-jon", "userReview": "A good horror novel with an interesting plot and plenty of macabre humour, The Pilo Family Circus mixes violence, slapstick, and a smidgen of H.P. Lovecraft together to good effect. In the story, Jaime is a perfectly normal, fairly meek twentysomething working as a concierge and spending his time daydreaming about hooking up with his beautiful co-worker. Then he meets \"the clowns\" and it all changes. Like a psychotic version of the Three Stooges in face paint, the clowns begin by terrorizing Jaime and soon decide to recruit him as a fellow clown in the greatest show this side of Hell: The Pilo Family Circus. Finding himself trapped in the circus and desparate to get away, Jaime soon learns that his biggest obstacle to escape is JJ, the person he becomes once the face paint is put on. According to the book's adage \"the nicer the person, the meaner the clown\", JJ is a sadist who likes his new career and dislikes sharing his body with a wus like Jaime.If you're looking for spine tingling scares, then keep on looking. There isn't much in the book that's particularly scary. It's mostly creepy with an ample amount of dark humour (and slapstick violence) scattered throughout it. The circus setting and it's performers are well described and Elliott keeps the origins and the true purpose of the circus a mystery for long enough to build some suspense.I particularly liked the struggle between Jaime and his dark half, JJ. Elliott does a good job of creating a despicable character in JJ and building on the tension of giving Jaime an opponent that knows all of his thoguhts and plans. Interesting enough, Elliott wrote this book during a time when he was diagnosed and struggled with schizophrenia. Though Elliott denies any part of the book is autobiographical, I'm sure some of his own struggle to maintain his identity and self crept into the tug of war between Jaime and JJ.Elliott's prose style is adequate for the material. There is nothing particularly elegant about his writing, but it's clear and concise. All in all, it's a fast and fun read."}, {"userName": "Edward Lorn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn", "userReview": "I did not expect that ending. I expected the ending from the John Cusack/Ray Liotta movie, IDENTITY. This one started off devilishly good. Original, dark, funny-as-hell, nasty, twisted, and more words and stuff and things. I loved it. Every paragraph had me either disgusted, intrigued, or laughing my balls off.Then the scenery changed. We go from Brisbane to the Pilo Family Circus and, oddly enough, the book became boring for me. I found the day in and day out ritual rather banal. JJ's actions didn't shock me because Winston said \"The nicer the guy the meaner the clown,\" so it ended up being all very predictable. I think this is what led me to believe that the book was going to turn out like IDENTITY. The twin sides of the MC, so I just figured everyone was Jaime. Or... Jaime was everyone. Whichever. Now, about the two of the clowns (and this is probably only me), they kinda blended together into my head. Goshy and Doopy seemed like the same clown, and it wasn't until the honeymoon scene (which was sheer fucking genius in my opinion; sick and brilliant) that I finally put a wedge between the two clowns and separated them. Both spoke in different speech patterns, but when they weren't talking and the author was just describing them doing things, I had a hard time keeping up with who was who. Gonko, Rufshod, and Winston all had their own separate personalities, but Goshy and Doopy seemed interchangeable. Like I said, though, this was probably just my own brain's problem and not the fault of the author.Speaking of the author, I've never heard of Will Elliott. I don't know his story, but it supposedly explains what he went through while writing this and strengthens most readers' enjoyment of the piece. I plan on reading his memoir, STRANGE PLACES, as soon as I can talk myself into its twelve dollar price point. Which brings me to the price of this book. I bought it on Amazon for $11.79, blindly. Well, kinda blindly. There's this reviewer I trust whole-hog. If she likes a book, it goes on my TBR list, no questions asked. Then I buy said book, no matter the price. Did I get my $12 worth? Yeah, but only because of that ending.SPOILERY SPOILS await the SPOILED because SPOILERS. Read the following SPOILERIFIC SPOILED SPOILERS at your own risk...This motherfucker ended like Stephen King's NEEDFUL THINGS. Which made me think... isn't the entire book a bit like NEEDFUL THINGS? People wishing for shit and getting it. People being set against one another. Everything devolving into an utter clusterfuck of chaos. Yep, the only thing missing was Leland Gaunt, but, when you think about it, Kurt Pilo was kinda that guy. Okay, maybe this isn't completely fair, but when I read the final page of Will Elliott's mindbending carnival story, I felt as if I'd just reread NEEDFUL THINGS. Do not get me wrong. This read like a tribute, not a rip off, so Elliott gets massive points for that.End SPOILERS!Welcome back to those of you who didn't want spoilers. I just noted why I liked the book. Yeah, ya kinda missed it... Sorry about that. Oh well, maybe next time.Should you run out and buy this for $12? Probably not. This will not be everyone's cuppa coco, and I don't want anyone popping back up offering to violate my rectum with their size tens because they spent the last of their meth money on THE PILO FAMILY CIRCUS and were disappointed because it's not their thing. In closing, I dug this book, a lot, but the middle droned on. The ending was perfect, though, which completely made up for the lackluster midsection. I'm off to read my first bizarro story.

The story idea was very unique and I thought many of the characterizations were quite excellent. It seemed to be flirting with brilliance, but... *mild spoilers*The first few chapters of this started off great and I thought I was in for a brutal and violent clown horror-fest. Then I got to know the clowns a little bit more and they somehow left me wanting a bit. There were definitely a few parts that were laugh out loud funny, but I just couldn\u2019t tell if the clowns were suppose to be dangerous or doofus. Gonko was by far my favorite clown and the rudest and crudest of the lot. He had some truly great dialog. Unfortunately, the main character(s) Jamie/JJ fell short for me. JJ for supposedly being such a \u201cbad-ass\u201d clown was really just a sniveling beatch throughout his time at the circus. Overall, I am glad that I read it. 3+ Stars and a recommended read for originality and premise alone. Note: The author bio and the story of how Pilo came to be written is a very amazing story in itself."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin", "userReview": "If nothing else, The Pilo Family Circus will be as original a horror novel as you will ever read. Sporting equal parts of Dante's Inferno and the Barnum & Bailey Circus, Will Elliott's surreal clown story will probably give you nightmares for a few nights. There has always been something dark about clowns and carnivals yet the author up the ante considerably on bad dreams and clown phobias. Part straight horror story and part hallucinogenic nightmare, this is a horror read that won't go away after you turn the lights back on."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56438628-john", "userReview": "What the heck did I just read?

I didn't get the horror of it all. Yes, it had its psycho moments, but there was a lot of repetition. Boring day in and day out stuff. They put on maybe two clown shows that were described?

For the most part, I did like the book, but there were some things that didn't really work for me. I didn't like the Jamie/JJ dichotomy, although it was a decent idea and made for some interesting problems for the characters to work out. The JJ character didn't seem as well developed as I would have liked, though -- I expected (and wanted) him to be MUCH worse than he really was. I didn't think the cowering and crying (even though it was partially an act) worked, and I found it more irritating the longer it went on.I also wanted a bigger story -- at the end of it all, it's really just about Jamie being sucked into this world, then trying to survive and escape. Well, okay. What else? Nothing! I just wanted something more. (The ending also left me with a lot of questions.)I stumbled onto this book while browsing some pretty bizarre titles, so in my mind I suppose I lumped this book in with them -- I thought it was going to be REALLY over the top, disgustingly violent, absolutely horrifying . . . You tell me why I wanted to read something like that, LOL, cause I don't know, but that's what I expected. This just isn't that book -- at least it wasn't for me. Maybe it would be terrifying and disturbing for someone else.So three stars for a good idea and decent (but not outstanding) execution. I'm not sure who I would recommend it to -- it's a bit odd for most people, I think, but not nearly odd enough for anyone looking for the truly bizarre.EDIT:I just can't stop thinking about this book. I keep having the nagging feeling that I've missed the bigger picture here. I just read a great review (sorry, great reviewer, I can't recall your name right now) that said the author takes great pains to make clear that this book was NOT autobiographical in any way, but I have to say (& man, I reeeeally hate to contradict THE AUTHOR!) I think this book is a perfect illustration of a mind at war with itself. Intentional or not, I do think this book has to be based on the writer's struggles with schizophrenia. With that in mind, I think this book deserves 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Adam Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2852338-adam-wilson", "userReview": "The Pilo Family Circus is one of those amazing reading experiences that, even if I forget the fine details in a few years, I will never forget the story and how much fun I had reading it. The book's description was almost enough to make me never want to give it a try since it sounded really, really stupid, but it is anything but. I can't blame whoever wrote the description I read though. I don't think I can explain it any better without making it sound just as bad or even worse. I can only say that this is a book so different from anything else that I have read that I can recommend it to everyone because chances are that you've never read anything like it either. \"But, this is a horror novel, and it involves clowns. Isn't that a little like IT by Stephen King?\" asks a horror fan I made up to make a point. \"No,\" says I \"it, The Pilo Family Circus, is not like IT or that or those.\" It is brilliant all the way through and covers seemingly everything from an inhuman teeth collector and eater to a wedding between a clown and a fern. What more could you ask for in a book? I will say though that I probably looked as creepy as Doopy, Goshy, Gonko, JJ, Rufshod, and all the other crazy characters while reading this one because of my almost constant grin and occasional giggling."}, {"userName": "Gregor Xane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2165551-gregor-xane", "userReview": "An excellent debut.
