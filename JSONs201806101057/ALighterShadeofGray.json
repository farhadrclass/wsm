It is about Devon Pearse's life....a life filled with sorrow and regret and a mother who began to develop mental illness when Devon was around twelve, but also a life with a loving father. Devon constantly was concerned about developing the same illness her mother suffered from. The book takes you through her childhood - through love and tragedy - and moves to the present with Devon as an adult and with her continuing problems and problems of friends with secrets. The author is quite clever in her writing style and insinuations...she aligns the \"shades of gray\" with how a mental illness fades a person just as a photo fades. She used colors as the comparison of moods and stages of reality to explain how colors indicated where Devon's mother was in terms of reality. Pearse is an outstanding writer...very eloquent and interesting. She makes very profound statements about life and about the choices we make about our life's dreams\u2026.dreams that we either \"murder\" or fulfill. She does this in a very interesting way and with very appealing characters. It takes a while to get to the gist of the story, but once you arrive, you will enjoy the book's purpose and plot. Ms. Pearse takes you on an emotional ride that includes love, lies, mystery, secrets, murder, and dealing with mental illness. You will become attached to Devon and to her emotions as she deals with and reacts to them in the right or wrong way but in a way only she knows how to deal with.The beginning of the book gave background information on her family, and it was all weaved into the very absorbing tale that unfolded. Some of the book isn't pleasant, but you will learn about mental illness and also about life in general...you may even learn some things that could help you in your personal life. A LIGHTER SHADE OF GRAY is about family, friendship, and decision-making along with a creative murder plot. It is a book that I would deem thought provoking.I enjoyed the book even though it took a few pages to become intriguing.\u2026but it is definitely worth the wait....it is a captivating, unique novel. My rating is 4/5."}, {"userName": "Susan (The Book Bag)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1516073-susan-the-book-bag", "userReview": "This book has a lot going on. Let's see, there's a failed romance, a mother's mental illness and the fear that it could happen to the daughter, another mental patient that seems to be taking the daughter's place in the mother's mind, a best friend suspected of murder, and a detective who just won't give up until he has all the answers.And these are just the main characters and story lines. Sound confusing? It's really not. The author does a fantastic job of weaving the stories and subplots together and creates a very intriguing story.At the center of the whole book is Devon, (semi-autobiographical, it seems) a very likable, caring person who has a great best friend, Cass. When Cass runs into some trouble, Devon is there for her, but at what cost? Devon sets out to do what she can to prove that Cass is innocent, even if there is some doubt that she really is.And Devon is also worried about her mother and the mental illness that has taken her away from the family. She misses her mom greatly and is terrified that the same thing is going to happen to her, so much so that she pushes the love of her life away. Will they ever be reunited?I loved the parts of the book when Devon and her mother communicated using colors. As her mom's mind was slipping, she and Devon could connect with each other by talking about the colors.'Gray was the only color you had to watch out for. Gray was lonely emptiness. Gray could make her cry.''I know, my sweetheart. But it won't always be, at least not for you. It might take a long time, but it will gradually get lighter, You'll fight your way through all the gray until you find the blue again. And then it will be so beautiful, like the dawn breaking after a storm. Just know that wherever I am, I love you my Lillibet. I'll always love you, even in the gray.'... 'I'll always love you, even in the gray.' Isn't that an awesome line? There is so much about this book that's great! Reading it was a beautiful way to spend my weekend. I understand that Devon is currently working on her second novel, The Untrodden Ways, due to be published in 2012.

A Lighter Shade of Gray is a passionate tale, and it mischievously leads the reader to assumptions that don't wind up panning out. Yet all is completely plausible, which, to these eyes, is this first-time novel's signature charm. The reader finds himself thinking \"ah, so that's it\" as \"Gray\" winds its way into his heart.As the main character shares the author's name, this novel is partly autobiographical. It's equal parts love story, rite of passage and intriguing whodunit.Set in St. Augustine, Fla., Pearse weaves a tale of love lost, mystery, murder, neurosis, psychosis and lingering self-doubt.I liked it from the opening page and loved it by the time I was through."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5095760-tammy", "userReview": "What an AMAZING debut!

I believed it would be a so-so story of a woman trying to find her way in life. I was wrong. \"A Lighter Shade of Gray\" by Devon Pearse was brilliant. It took you on an emotional whirlwind as the narrator told you about her love for her next-door neighbor's nephew, her mother illness, her best friend's run-in with the law, and her trying to find her way in the world. At times I found myself crying out of sadness and smiling for joy. Although it is a bit long, there is no slow parts in the book and I wanted to devour every word the author wrote.

Meaning that there are parts which were boring and then the ones that made me want to keep reading. Actually it really became interesting about halfway into the book. This is where are started to really like it, but due to it dragging so long in the beginning it can't be more than 3 stars.Of course the beginning was necessary as it gave us many important details, but maybe it culd have been written in a more interesting way or shorter.I really liked the story about her friendship with Cass. Their relationship is the most realistic in the book. The story that comes out of it isn't too realistic but is the one that kept me wanting to finish and see how it ends. The story about her mother was also not bad. It has the interesting point of mental health in it and added a lot to Devon's personality and how she sees life. The story with Drew is the one that was a bit too boring. Yet it was an important part and surprisingly this was the ending that I liked the most as it seemed to be so close to real life.

Friendship. Love. Murder. I like those elements...in books. A Lighter Shade of Gray by Devon Pearse has all three. And it's semi-autobiographical, which is why our main character is also named Devon. Throughout the book, I was wondering what was fact and what was fiction?Devon gave up on love 10 years ago. Her mother has long battled mental illness, and Devon will do anything to avoid that path. I thought she sacrificed her own happiness out of fear. Yes mental illness is inherited, but I'm not a firm believer in acting on what might happen. Rather than take a chance on happiness and love, Devon is just waiting for the shoe to drop. Not everything is gloomy for Devon, she has a close group of friends, including her best friend Cassandra (a.k.a. Cass) Sloane.At times, Devon and Cass seemed more like family than friends. In the beginning, Devon attends a birthday party with Cass' family. She just seemed like another member of the family. They were quick to point out Devon's lack of cooking skills. She's included on the family banter. There is no hiding problems in the family from Devon, especially, Marcus, the abusive boyfriend of Cass' sister Monique. That part really grabbed my attention. The rest of the Sloane family is ready to pounce on him at any moment, but Monique is too afraid to stand up for herself. I was right there with the rest of the family. \"Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!\" Character-wise it was no big loss when he was murdered. Not that I'm an advocate of murder, but there is just no attachment to abusive characters. There was an attachment to Cass, who is accused of his murder. Devon wants anything to prove her friend's innocence, but it forces her to face her fears. Her fear of ending up like her mother.In theory, all of that made for a good plot. But as the book progressed I got a little confused. Her mother's roommate claims to know something about Marcus' murder. I just thought, why even go there? There's too much going here. Devon's fears of mental illness alone could have been enough. Adding Cass and her family to the mix makes things a little more complicated, and then you add her mother's roommate. It was also a little long for my taste. It's not a bad book, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.Rating: Give it a tryNote: I received an e-copy as part of a tour with TLC Book Tours"}, {"userName": "Lana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7244387-lana", "userReview": "Amazing--This book has it all.

A past before her mother slipped away into the gray mists of mental illness that has kept her hospitalized for over a decade. A past where three little girls ran and laughed and played, before one of them was killed before her sixteenth birthday. A past where Drew was always there waiting for her; the love she'd always imagined.But the past's tendrils can't stand up to the forces of the present. The present where Devon has lived for over a decade without Drew, who she sent away due to her fear of ending up like her mother. Now things are breaking and changing and Devon must adjust.For one thing, Drew is back in town. Can Devon and Drew pick up where they left off, or is their love forever in the past? Next, her mother shows signs of emerging from her illness, but is this because of the teenage girl who is now her roommate and who seems determined to take Devon's place in her mother's life? Finally, the abusive boyfriend of her best friend's sister has been brutally murdered, and suspicion falls on Cass, Devon's best friend. Can Cass untangle the mystery and save everyone's life?Devon Pearse has written a haunting novel, although the fact that her main character is also named Devon Pearse may be confusing at first to the reader. She has created characters that seem strong one minute, then shadowy the next, echoing the way mental illness recedes and then reconquers the sick mind. The values of love, friendship and family are strong propellers of the action, and the reader will want to finish to find out what happens to the people met between the pages.

The novel could actually be broken up into several stories. I enjoyed being swept up into the inner workings of the main character. However, I was frequently confused and had to stop several times to regroup and figure out where I was in relation to all of the stories that were unfolding. I know that the narrator was the connection between all the stories, but at several points I felt like things could have been edited to make the book more succinct. In spite of these issues, I did enjoy the book. I especially liked the Cass story line. The friendship between Cass and Devon was fun to read. The relationship of Devon and her parents was also page turning. I imagine that it must be hard to experience a loved one having a mental breakdown. The attempts of the narrator and her father to hide her mother's illness and keep things as normal as possible was heart wrenching. As more stories of mental illness are shared, I hope that the stigma decreases. On the back cover and in the author note, Devon Pearse mentions that the story is semi-autobiographical. As I was reading, I kept wondering how she made the disctinction. With a story so personal and intense, I imagine that it would be hard to know where to draw the boundaries."}, {"userName": "Al", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1698114-al", "userReview": "Characterized in the official descriptions as \u201csemi-autobiographical,\u201d I\u2019ll leave it to you to decide which parts are true and which aren\u2019t (your guess is as good as mine).

Are the causes genetic? Devon is fearful that she\u2019s seeing a glimpse of her future and is unwilling to commit to her boyfriend, or even allow him to commit to her. In fact, Devon goes through much of life making decisions influenced by what might happen. There is some mystery and potential romance to liven up the story as well.

Or to anticipate your own? Would you drive away your only love? Could you pretend it didn't matter? How far would you go to protect a friend, or to avenge a death? Ten years ago, Devon gave up the love of her life, fearing she would one day fall victim to the mental illness that has slowly ravaged the mind of her mother, who is now being cared for in a private facility. Just when it seems Devon might have a chance to make up for past mistakes, her best friend Cass becomes a suspect in the murder of her sister's drug-dealing boyfriend. Devon knows Cass is lying about the details of her involvement and the lead detective on the case, convinced that Cass is guilty, is relentless in his pursuit of justice. When her mother's young, emotionally disturbed roommate insinuates she knows something about the night of the murder, as well as details from Devon's own life that no one else is privy to, Devon becomes desperate to uncover the truth before Detective Lake does. As the investigation continues, Devon is led down a path she never expected and forced to face her greatest fears of life and love. Tangled in a web of lies, regrets and questions, can she find a way to let go of the past and start again? And, once the mystery is solved, can she live with the secrets she's uncovered?
