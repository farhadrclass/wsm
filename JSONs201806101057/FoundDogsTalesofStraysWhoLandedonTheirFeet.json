Apparently, I love them, and thus I loved this book.My Review:I think I'm becoming a dog-book junkie. This collection of owner's descriptions of dogs is, to me, a fascinating look at the way people view their relationships to their favorite pets. The people interviewed in this book are from all walks - the famous, the ordinary, the unknown (including a homeless man). Yes, this is one of those 'feel good' books that some people hate and some people love. I loved it. (Interestingly, I saw this book at Lucky Dog Used Books in Dallas - wasn't looking for it, but there it was. Ha!)"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/902083-karen", "userReview": "This is a sweet book; the stories of the \"found dogs\" who were adopted into happy homes are very touching. In addition to providing an enjoyable read for people who already have dogs, I hope it will encourage those looking to add a dog to their family to consider adopting one of the many who are in desperate need of a home. So many times I hear people say that they wouldn't adopt a rescue dog because \"they all have serious problems.\" This book might help to alter that perception."}, {"userName": "Jami", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/623869-jami", "userReview": "What a sweet book.

The dogs included in this book were abandoned in animals shelters, at racetracks, or just by the side of the road. They were found and given a second chance by their current owners, but you ll wonder why they were ever lost when you meet these characters, from the mixed breed service dog with a vocabulary of over 300 words to the tiny furball companion of a female pilot who accompanies her everywhere on the ground and in the air. Renowned author and dog lover Peter Mayle is contributing the forward and celebrity contributions by the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis and Vice-President Albert Gore make this a top-notch collection. The exquisite black and white photographs capture the bond between these people and the dogs they love with incredible emotion and sensitivity.
