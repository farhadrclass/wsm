I was 13 in 1978, and these guys were my heroes. I read this book when it first came out in 1979, and loved it. Sparky was the \"good guy\", Reggie and George were the \"bad guys.\" But now, reading it as an adult, Sparky was no hero either. Leaving the stadium during a game without permission, showing up late for spring training, certainly not the hero I'd seen him as in my youth.That being said, his humor is engaging and he certainly pulls no punches. As a nice counterpoint to this book, I'd recommend Roger Kahn's \"October Men\" which an unbiased observers take on the '78 Yankees (and done by an accomplished author)."}, {"userName": "Lisa Kilbride", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2590757-lisa-kilbride", "userReview": "The same format as Ball Four, but not as happy a ball player, which made for difficult reading.

This includes all the Yankees games from 1978 day by day. Sparky \"a good pitcher\" made this book a good read for baseball freaks. It was a year after Reggie had bombered 3 home runs to lead the Yankees to a World Series victory in 1977. 1978 made another victory for them. Many of these diaries are interesting like how Billy Martin got fired that year and just a few days later on Old Timers Day, He was going to return as a manager in 1980 (He actually returned a following year later).

A fraught season with a glorious (unless you happened to be, like me, a Bosox fan) ending, the season marked the swan song of Sparky Lyle's Yankee's career; the Boss went on one of free agent buying sprees, during which he acquired Rich \"Goose\" Gossage, which in the words of fellow Steinbrenner sufferer Graig \"Puff\" Nettles, relegated Sparky \"from Cy Young to sayonara\". Buried in the depths of the Yankees' pen, Lyle had a front row seat for the insanity that was the Yankees' clubhouse. Between Steinbrenner, Billy Martin, and Reggie Jackson, the inmates were definitely running the asylum, with ample support from such colorful characters as Mickey Rivers, \"Sweet\" Lou Pinella (not so sweet when he made too many outs), Cliff Johnson, Catfish Hunter, and of course Lyle himself, who, by his own account, spent the entire season in a prolonged snit after Gossage joined the club. He even went so far as to walk from the team on at least one occasion; unlike Bill Lee, who left the Red Sox to protest the trading of Bernie Carbo, and later staged a career-ending walk-out to protest the release of Rodney Scott from the Expos, Sparky walked to protest his own demotion from closer to mop-up man.Although he might not come across in this narrative as being especially eloquent (his contribution to my word-hoard will consist entirely in the phrase \"that's church\" to indicate finality), Sparky is no dummy: he put his finger on what would become the problem with Steinbrenner's \"fix-it-now\" philosophy of personnel management, and which would cause the Bombers to wander in the wilderness from 1981 through 1994. The Boss had no patience for developing a farm system, preferring to pursue flashy free agents. However, Sparky is hardly infallible; this is what he has to say about Bobby Bonds:\"Bobby is going to get traded forever because for all his power, he can't hit in the fourth spot. He strikes out too much, so the manager always ends up leading him off 'cause you gotta get him out of the way as quick as you can. Let him do his damage, if he's going to do any, and that's it. When we had him here in New York, we were expecting great things of him, but the next thing you know, he was leading off. I mean the guy was hitting 30 home runs and he was leading off!\" This is reminiscent of Buddy Ryan's idiotic critique of Anthony Carter: \"All he does is score touchdowns!\" When Bonds was allowed to be a lead-off hitter, he was one of the best in the Majors, all those strikeouts notwithstanding: all he did was score runs. The fact that a bunch of dunker-headed managers spent the middle '70's trying to turn him into a cleanup batter was hardly Bonds' fault."}, {"userName": "M. Milner", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104186-m-milner", "userReview": "1978 was a pretty great year for baseball, especially in New York. The Yankees, down by 14 games in July, roared back and took the AL East pennant in a one-game playoff against Boston. Anyway, if you're a baseball fan, you probably have some knowledge of that. And here, in The Bronx Zoo, is the other side of that season: what happened off the field, away from the cameras and inside the clubhouse.Lyle's book is a wild read, ranging from raunchy clubhouse tales to keen observation. He'll go from a story about sitting on a cake to pointing out why his pitches aren't working, sometimes even in the same paragraph. Written as a diary breaking down the season day-by-day (think Ball Four), the season seems to take forever sometimes as losses mount and drama in the front office keeps mounting between Billy Martin and George Steinbrenner, both of whom come off as high-strung, insecure and made for each other. The team is packed with personality, too: between the sensitive, and quiet Thurman Munson and the bombastic, publicity-loving Reggie Jackson, this Yankee team just drips with colourful characters. Jackson really steals it as the prototypical 21st Century superstar, always happy to give a sharp quip into the microphone, even if it's less than truthful (\"You guys heard that?\" he asks the assembled media after one scathing comment on a radio broadcast, \"if I'd known you were listening I'd have said something different.\")There are the occasional flashes of insight between the day-to-day: Lyle occasionally explains why a pitcher's pitches aren't working, the little ways a fielder is making great plays and at the little differences made by a team on a hot streak; there's also the occasional show of casual ballplayer misogyny, too. And while he's never removed from the shenanigans in the clubhouse, he's something of a bemused observer, cataloging the pranks, off-hand comments and tension on one of the most memorable seasons in baseball. Recommended, especially for Yankee fans."}, {"userName": "B", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6063018-b", "userReview": "There's a series of stories that everyone likes to tell . . . . The Reggie-George-Billy triangle. The George craziness. The Bucky Dent homerun.Here, probably the most exciting part is Lyle's perspective. The problem is that Lyle is a real whiner in this book. And not in a real consistent way. I think you could find opposing whines throughout. So it's got this kind of \"You Know Me, Al\" feel to it.Probably his three biggest are:(1) He is only pitching badly because he's not pitching enough. So under his theory the wrost players should play more often. OK, right?(2) He wants more money becasue other players were getting more money. At seeral phases of free agency the new contracts severely outweighed the existing contracts. It's hard to make this equitable and this is an understandable complaint. Although I generally have no problem with players demanding more money I don't like midcontract negotiations. Owners should not feel free to do so either. So this isn't amazingly sympathetic. (3) Reggie Jackson is bad and everyone should hate him. This reminds of the A-Rod stuff today. I thought the stats would be a little clearer on this. Like I imagined Reggie Jackson would be worth 5-6 WAR because he was a HOF'r. But he was only 3.5 wins in 139 games. Lou Piniella was 3.7 wins in 130 games. Reggie was fourth among hitters. So, you know, not the best. But Lyle also touts guys like Roy White (0.8 WAR in 103 games)It's especially tough when, you know, Sparky Lyle 0.4 bWAR in 111.2 IP. Anyway, this is a real argument for some kind of intangible grit and team chemistry. I'm not sure it pulls it off because it's kind of incoherent as an argument. By contrast, Jim Bouton, for instance, has a specific goal/perspective: \"You wouldn't believe how these guys are all not heroes at all.\" But kind of interesting as a different perspective. http://www.baseball-reference.com/tea..."}, {"userName": "Michael Kallan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7361912-michael-kallan", "userReview": "One of my favorite books ever; probably have read it ten times over the last 30+ years. 1978 was the first year I was really into baseball for the whole season, and at that time I was a big Yankees fan. It turned out to be a memorable season full of larger than life personalities, with the Yankees making up a 14 game deficit to the Red Sox in July, taking the division lead in September, watching Boston come back to tie them on the last game of the regular season, and it culminating in a 1 game playoff in game 163 at Fenway Park on a Monday afternoon. It was Rosh Hashanah that day, so I was able to watch the playoff game instead of being in my second grade class.Reading the book brings me back to that season, and learning about the personalities and how they clashed throughout the first 3 1/2 months, and yet finally meshed late in the year leading to the climatic comeback and eventual world championship. As a seven year old, I never imagined any of what the book described beyond the actual game action.Lyle (with help from his co-author Peter Golenbock) tells one hilarious story after another from his long career, yet you can see how he is struggling with his fall from closer to glorifies mop-up man (he won the 1977 Cy Young award, but was more or less replaced in the closer role by free agent signee Goose Gossage during the 1978 season). The book is not written on the level of a David Halberstam novel, but it has a wonderful flow and brings me back to some wonderful memories of my youth. My late grandfather took me to my first two major league games that summer (Pirates vs. Mets @ Shea Stadium in June, then A's vs. Yankees @ Yankee Stadium that August).

I enjoyed the book largely because of the the circus atmosphere generated by that team's \"chemistry\" and their inimitable owner. The diary really captures the personalities of some of the key players of the zoo clubhouse. I came away detesting Mickey Rivers , Reggie Jackson, and George Steinbrenner(But that merely confirmed my opinion of the latter two.). I also came away with a deep appreciation of just how hard it is for a manager to do his job with players who make mega bucks, consider themselves as prima donnas, and who believe they are bigger than the game or its rules and customs. And that was 1978! I can only imagine what it's like now when players are making 25 million a year or more in many cases. It's no wonder Billy Martin had a breakdown and was an alcoholic( I know he had the problem in the 50's too).What I did not like was the constant, repetitive, obnoxious, and self centered obsessing by Lyle over every conceivable perceived slight to him by ownership, players, and fans. Suck it up-you signed a contract and then you want more. Well you got more. Then you bitched because you weren't used in the right role. Then you would rather have less money to play more. What about caring for the team and team loyalty? I sure hope that after 35 years, if you have reread this book, you will see how immature and selfish you were in 1978. Perhaps you can redeem yourself with a new version that has a longer epilogue."}, {"userName": "Tom Gase", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2339366-tom-gase", "userReview": "I've read a lot of books about the 1978 season, either from the Yankees side or the Red Sox side but couldn't remember reading one that had been told by a player (with help from Peter Golenbock)so this was refreshing. Sparky Lyle was the Cy Young award winner of the 1977 season and is the author of this book. After winning the 1977 Cy Young the Yankees go out and get Goose Gossage for the bullpen, basically putting Lyle out of the closer role even after winning the Cy Young. Lyle chronicles that plus the highly caotic year the 1978 Yankees had. On its way to winning their second straight World Series, but this one in more dramatic fashion, the Yankees were constantly fighting with Manager Billy Martin, especially Reggie Jackson. The more I read about Reggie Jackson over the years the more I dislike him. Total hot dog of a player that was kind of a crybaby. This doesn't come just from this book. This is about the fifth book I've read to portray him this way. Also interesting stories on Martin, Steinbrener, Gossage, Thurman Munson, Mickey Rivers (another crybaby), Craig Nettles, Lou Pinella, Cliff Johnson (a big crybaby), Willie Randolph, Catfish Hunter, Ron Guidry and countless others including a Yankee player you can't say the name of in Boston since October of 1978. Good stuff but Lyle comes off as a crybaby at times too, so I didn't like the book as much because of that. I liked Peter Golenbock's \"Bums\" a little more and of the 1978 books I've read this one falls somewhere in the middle."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/984068-greg", "userReview": "Oh my gosh this book is so funny. I laughed out loud several times. Sparky tells the truth and it's a riot. Sparky's very opinionated, but he was in an interesting position--it was well known by the Yankees front office that he wanted to be traded, and he was, so there was no reason for him to hold back in this book. You certainly get an early indication of what a jackwagon Stienbrenner was (and how limited his baseball knowledge was) and what a show-boater Reggie Jackson was.For all that, Sparky's remarkably cordial about Goose Gossage, the pitcher who was brought in basically to replace him, even though Lyle had just won the Cy Young Award (sort of like losing your publishing contract the year after you win the Pulitzer). You also wonder why he barely talks about his family. I know it's a baseball book, but dang, all the stuff he went through had to have had an interesting effect on his family.My only problem was remembering who some of the guys were--he switches from first names to last names to nicknames often, and it gets hard to tell who some of the ancillary characters are--and there are lots of them.Still, it's a great book and a fun read, especially for anyone who remembers and cheered for (or against) the Yankees in 1977 and 1978. I was nine years old at the time, and many of these names are branded in my brain from baseball card collections and watching the 78 playoffs on TV, right down to remembering how incredibly awful a Reggie bar tasted."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/184521-john", "userReview": "This book was really entertaining, if a bit repetitive. Plus if you are interested enough in baseball to want to read it, you already know what happened to the yankees (and red sox) in 1978, so there is a lot of temptation to skip ahead while Lyle rehashes all the shitty games that the Yankees played early in the season. But the really interesting thing about this book was the portrait of the yankees of the 70's as the crazy, prank playing, who the hell cares, funny moustache team, while the red sox were the corporate, no sense of humor, don't get along with each other team. Complete opposite of the last few years. All Lyle did besides occasionally pitch the seventh inning in 1978 was sit on people's birthday cakes with his bare ass, and also sometimes destroy their clothes that they left in their lockers. Good times! Plus it's funny to read about Steinbrenner already starting so soon after he took over the team to point them towards their downfall in the 80s, just always picking up huge contracts for no reason, just to have all the highest paid players on his team."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3792493-william", "userReview": "This is another entry in the light-hearted-but-still-iconoclastic eccentric baseball wiseguy memoir, The Bronx Zoo picks up where Ball Four left off. Lyle probably isn't as smart as Ball Four author Jim Bouton, but he's probably funnier. And he gives us a first-hand, on-the-ground, real-time account of the not-as-tumultuous-as-'77-but-still-tumultuous 1978 Yankee season, which also included a dramatic comeback of the Yankees over the collapsing Red Sox after being as much as 14 games back as late a mid-July or something like that. Curse you, Bucky Dent.The Bronx Zoo had it's moments but felt like it dragged on longer that it should have. Also, like Bouton before him, Lyle kind of annoys me. He complains a lot about Reggie Jackson's ego, but he seems pretty self-focused himself.

Lyle doesn't quite dish the dirt in the manner of Bouton about sex and drug use among athletes, but he does show the crass and petty side of human relations in a closed environment full of egos chasing a common goal. I was also a serious biology student, and I was astonished that Lyle preferred to throw as hard as he could on the first day of camp, then sit out the rest of the spring with this 'injury' until the inflammation subsided.
