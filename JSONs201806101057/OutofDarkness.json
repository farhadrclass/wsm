The author's work for Teach for America Corps inspired her debut novel, What Can't Wait. Her gritty sophomore novel, The Knife and The Butterfly, explored the consequences of gang violence.P\u00e9rez's third novel, Out of Darkness features a clandestine romance which dares to cross the racial divide of 1930's Texas. Inspired by the most deadly school disaster in American history, this provocative novel gives voice to those whose voices were silenced and whose histories were unjustly revised. In Out of Darkness seventeen-year-old Naomi moves with her half siblings to her stepfather's new home in an oil drilling settlement town. When their Mexican-American mother died in childbirth seven years earlier, Naomi became the surrogate mother to the twins. Now Naomi must balance the demands of being the only Mexican-American at her high school with keeping house for her Caucasian stepfather, whom she despises.A sign at the town diner: \"No Negroes, Mexican or dogs.\" Beautiful Naomi becomes the object of desire and of racial prejudice. She finds secret pleasure with Wash, an intelligent boy who is a senior at the all black school in a segregated town. They imagine a future together with the twins, free from persecution. The writing is as lush and as beautiful as the landscape:\"It was getting late, but time seemed to stretch like taffy. The pines stood out dark against the pinks and oranges creeping across the sky, and a breeze stirred around her. She found herself walking to their spot at the river. It was not a usual meeting time for them, but she couldn't help hoping.\"After an explosive and confusing start, the narrative down-shifts to an unrushed pace, building tension slowly and allowing for in depth character development. The chapters are told from multiple points of view: Naomi, her Born Again stepfather, her seven-year-old half brother and her boyfriend Wash. Their star-crossed romance is realistically rendered with adolescent lust and idealistic love. The pace accelerates to a page-turner ending that left me stunned and shattered. Although this tragic story was set in the 1930s, the central theme of racism still feels relevant today.Out of Darkness could have been published as literary historical fiction for adults. Since this novel includes sexual abuse, pedophilia and graphic violence, I would only recommend it to mature teens and to adults who aren't afraid to explore the dark side of human nature. Both Kirkus Reviews and School Library Journal gave this soon to be released book starred reviews. Out of Darkness is P\u00e9rez's strongest young adult novel so far and shows a maturity of voice, technique and vision. I look forward to reading more of her work.Follow the link to my blog for the author's explanation about why she wrote this historical novel: http://blog.sarahlaurence.com/2015/08..."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2465264-donna", "userReview": "I don\u2019t get book hangovers very often but when I finished reading OUT OF DARKNESS I swore, I took the names of various deities in vain, and I stared off into space for a few minutes. I was physically exhausted by the time I read the last line. This book will just tear you apart from the inside out and spit you out on the back end.OUT OF DARKNESS is a dark book that deals with some really rough things like blatant and violent racism and statutory rape. At times it\u2019s a difficult book to read but it\u2019s so damn compelling I dare you to willingly put it down. If life didn\u2019t get in the way I have no doubt I would have just plowed through this in a (very long) sitting.The story itself focuses on a real event that happened in East Texas where leaking gas caused a white school to explode back in 1937. The majority of the events that happen around that particular moment are fictional but they\u2019re not outside the realm of reason. Some of the things are outlandish and grotesque and as a human being you\u2019ll have a hard time fathoming how people can think in such ways and act in even worse ways. But when you sit down and you really let that darkness in you\u2019ll know that while these specific events may be fictional what they\u2019re based on is not. This country went through some dark times and that kind of thinking runs deep, even today, and hopefully dragging it out into the light in such a way gives people a reminder that this wasn\u2019t that long ago, racism isn\u2019t dead, and if we allow this ignorance to come back into the light this is the kind of fear that everyone would be living in.Perez switched POVs between Naomi, Beto (Naomi\u2019s little brother), Wash (Naomi\u2019s love interest), and Henry (Naomi\u2019s step-father), with a sprinkling of The Gang thrown in, this mob mentality thought bubble that isn\u2019t specific to any one individual but the collective brain of those thinking the same things. It didn\u2019t need to be specific and that was the point. It\u2019s a look into the hive brain functioning in East Texas and it\u2019s meant to be horrifying.I\u2019ll start with Henry first because he\u2019s just repugnant. But getting into his head you see his thought process. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant as a way of understanding why he did what he did but it allows you a look behind the curtain to see how he\u2019s reasoning with himself and how his mind is breaking down everything that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s a high level of expectation and ownership because he\u2019s a white man and certain things should be bestowed upon him. Henry has a very solid ideal of what his life should be like but when reality doesn\u2019t match up with that he doesn\u2019t know how to cope so he allows his anger, his frustration, and his scapegoating to really rear its ugly head and take his failings out outwardly, where he thinks they belong. As a rational human being reading his sections it\u2019s horrifying because there is nothing rational about Henry.Naomi, Beto, and Wash are just trying to exist in this really messed up world. Naomi and Wash are well aware of the world of racism around them and they try to function around them as much as possible. Beto just loves who he loves and skin color means nothing to him. He recognizes right from wrong and knows enough that even when someone of authority does something wrong he shouldn\u2019t blindly follow. He\u2019s not aware of the blatant racism around him, being light-skinned and able to pass for white. He doesn\u2019t see how people treat Naomi or Wash (in part because they don\u2019t allow him to see it) and when he does see injustices toward them happening he doesn\u2019t fall into the hive. He hurts when people he loves hurt and it\u2019s heartbreaking to see him in pain.Naomi and Wash are two just incredibly endearing characters that are immediately likable. Naomi is a little more outwardly bitter (for lack of better words) and evasive toward people because of how she\u2019s been treated in her past while Wash, at the insistence of his father, has adapted to it in a way that forces him to kowtow to people spitting on him. Each have adapted to shut out the world around them and function as best they can but when they find each other and those public barriers come down they can finally be who they really are and they both open up to each other.The ending, though, is what really destroyed me. No spoilers but I\u2019ll just say things don\u2019t get better.OUT OF DARKNESS is a difficult, brutal look at a window to our country\u2019s history when everyone was suffering but some moreso than others at the hands of those who had it a little better simply because of skin color. It\u2019s a look at what did happen in our past but it doesn\u2019t mean this kind of thinking stayed in our past. It\u2019s a rather apt book to read considering the talking orangutan running for Republican presidential nominee who has no problem publicly scapegoating minorities and wants to actually evict those people from this country. Racism is not dead. Not by a longshot and this book is a lesson in how bad it was and how bad it could be again. Lessons are hard learned and a lot of the people in this book didn\u2019t learn them. Reading that should make your skin crawl. This SHOULD be a painful book to get through, in so many different ways. If it doesn\u2019t tear at your soul a little it may make me question your humanity.5I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202724-jessica", "userReview": "You know what this book is about from the first page. The worst school tragedy in American history (I almost looked it up to see if it still was, but then I didn't want to know): a gas explosion in a Texas oilfield school that killed most of the students and teachers. It's also about racism, about family, about death and loss, abuse, and violence. And that's why I'm not really sure about how I feel about this book. It starts with the explosion and the community working to clear away the debris, gathering up pieces of the bodies, mostly of children. Then it rewinds a year, to show the events leading up to this. We're introduced to several characters: an African American teen boy, a Mexican girl, her little brother, their white stepfather. As they interact with each other, with the community, the whole picture begins to emerge. It's a tense book, with a lot going on, especially behind closed doors.And then there will be a chapter where you get to read about someone masturbating. And then the story moves on, and the tension ramps up, and . . . then there's some more masturbating. At first it was a character who was well . . . icky. The antagonist of the story. But then, possibly so that Perez is not seen to be preaching that only perverts and abusers engage in such behavior, she throws in scenes of pretty much everyone else doing it. Which just . . . irritated me. It distracted from the plot, slackened the tension, and felt like padding to a story I was racing to finish. There are a lot of little kids in this story, and I wanted to know if they all died! I didn't want to read about someone sitting in a tree, pleasuring themselves! (Which just doesn't seem safe!)And then I got the explosion. And it was horrible. Just a terrible tragedy. And the aftermath: heartbreaking. And then . . . It just keeps going, and getting more horrible. Unnecessarily horrible. Graphic violence. Rape. People being absolutely brutalized, in bloody detail. I literally thought I might throw up. And why? Why did this need to be on the page? I really don't think it did. It did not do anything for me except upset me. It was absolutely gratuitous."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/705797-alicia", "userReview": "http://wordnerdy.blogspot.com/2016/03...So this is being described as a novel about a major disaster--an explosion at a school in Texas in 1937--as a backdrop for a story about love, family, segregation, racism, etc. Which is accurate. But is also a novel about a young girl being molested by her stepfather. This is why trigger warnings are a thing! I don't want to read books about young girls being molested, I find it upsetting (I think understandably). I am especially tired of picking up YA books that I think are going to be literary and moving, and having them be super rapey. I mean, half the town thinks she should marry her stepfather, so gross! I cannot deal with this sort of thing anymore--and that's not even getting STARTED on the extremely crazy and bummerific ending--which I live-chatted in a Slack channel b/c I was so horrified (and bemused).

Furthermore, I was SO EXCITED to see an interracial romance that wasn\u2019t black and white. PUN! Would that be considered a pun? Moving on!!!! Heartbreaking, beautiful, and superbly executed read about race, politics, and love that is very much relevant today. Let\u2019s talk about my the tragical element. The two main characters mixed in with Naomi\u2019s crazy stepfather and his lemme-get-advice-from-this-terrible-yet-i-know-of-plenty-that-still-exist-could-be-baptist-preacher relationship. When we meet Wash & Naomi---they were just radiating thatEspecially because (in my cinematic mind) Let\u2019s just say that BOI: Meets GURL: andensues. In the teenage-agnst-way because nothing says first love like a -whole-lotta-communication-issues. Yet, it was the undercurrents of the book that made it precious. Those menacing undertones like Naomi\u2019s past and Wash's future. The fact that the \u201cgang\u201d was narrating and I\u2019m like OH SHIT something is going to go down, and when I was younger that would bug me. The older I get---I treasure the wonderful moments, the moments that you're hidden in a tree and sharing love with one other person that gets you. Deadpool (the movie) had a fun quote: Here's the thing. Life is an endless series of trainwrecks with only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness. This had been the ultimate commercial break. Which meant it was time to return to our regularly scheduled programming. The fact that Perez (took the time) went and made the stepfather a well-rounded character blew me away. Don\u2019t get me wrong, what he does is sickening and despicable, but i love that you get into his pysche. ESPECIALLY when I heard the stories in my own family line through convos with my mom that \u201cback in the day\u201d a LOT of young women were married off/abused by their older stepfather. Yet, no one is talking/writing about all the crazy justifications that happened in history. ESPECIALLY That the church LOTSA TIMES tried to put their \u201cstamp of God\u2019s approval on it...\u201d  I LOVED that she delved into that aspect. More importantly, I loved that the younger brother got to see the dichotomy of race relations. I'm always surprised at how much history we DON\u2019T learn about (i don\u2019t know why i\u2019m always ending up surprised) This is a fascinating glimpse of a town right up to the tragedy and the individuals affected by the aftermath. I\u2019m briefly touching a few themes. This book is an experience, which I feels makes you a better person JUST BY READING IT. I feel you go through if not a transformation a metamorphsis after from beginning to end. The best part is it looks hefty, but BOY does it read fast. I was hooked and felt I flew through the book faster than what I had anticipatd. For me, the heart and soul of this book revolves around the color lines. The internalized views of the town people as they treated Naomi differently than her step siblings. The fact that your ethnic differences can be looked at as an \"exotic plus,\" which causes boys to want you and girls to hate you. OH MAN. Ashley Perez is a hell of an author.

Here's my review:https://suchanovelidea.com/2017/06/ou... Out of Darkness is a tough book to read due to dark themes, but readers should not be dissuaded. This book puts a spotlight on racism in the south. East Texas during the 1930\u2019s was a highly racist time period for anyone who was not white. This book dives into racism that is not addressed often in young adult fiction. This book demonstrates the injustice of racism at that time period with an emphasis on Mexican Americans and African Americans. This book is strong with the emphasis placed on racial issues as well as the theme of love. Naomi already had a strong family connection with her siblings, but she had yet to experience love. This novel dives into a realistic, but star-crossed, first love which is believable and powerful.There are aspects of this book that could be difficult for some readers to handle. Readers should be aware of issues of rape and molestation are within this novel. This could be a downside for some readers who are unable to handle these topics. These topics are highly sensitive and could evoke trigger warnings with some readers. All readers are sure to be made uncomfortable by these additions to the book. However, these issues did not take away from the story but enhanced it. They were included with good reason. The author handled them delicately and was not too heavy handed.This book could appeal to many young adults for the various themes. Young adults hoping to learn more about segregation and racism issues will find a lot to take out of this book. Those interested in love stories and family connections will find a heartwarming, if not also heartbreaking story. All of the themes within this book serve as appeal to young adults. This book is also a sort of history lesson on the tragic New London school Explosion of March 18, 1937. Young adults have a lot to gain from reading this book. This book is sure to stay within the minds of many people for years to come. It is a story that is not easy to forget."}, {"userName": "Cindy Rodriguez", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5164443-cindy-rodriguez", "userReview": "As soon as I finished Ashley's novel, I wanted to reread it as a writer. I want to pull it apart and study it because it's that good. One of the things I appreciate most was the slow burn of the narrative. The novel opens with the explosion, and then flashes back to show how the characters' live intersect before the event. The fuse lit in that opening scene coils through the narrative, gaining in intensity as the story leads back to the explosion and then its aftermath. The tension in Naomi's home, school, and community is palpable throughout the story and increases slowly as we're lead into the heartbreaking climax.Ashley masterfully balances the big picture and the smallest details. Her writing made me think of a photographer who could both go wide and capture a panoramic view and then zoom in for a close up and not lose anything in this process. She also beautifully balances the swoony magic of falling deeply in love for the fist time and the absolutely brutal realities faced by African-Americans and Mexicans at this time in history.

I'm torn between a 4 and a 5 for the book simply because I wanted more at the book's conclusion. And oh, how I wish things could have turned out differently. As they grew more and more out of control and I could sense an ending coming that I did not want, I felt the same way I felt when reading John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. Why did it have to be this way? But then again, given all the circumstances, how could it be any other way? Told by alternating narrators, including one group labeled \"The Gang,\" those nameless, faceless individuals who egg each other one, throwing stones and ruining reputations by spreading gossipy poison behind others' backs, the story is set in East Texas in 1936 and 1937. Henry Smith, an oil worker, has been convinced by his preacher to do the right thing and bring his children to stay with him now that he's had a religious conversion. He also brings along his step-daughter Naomi Vargas, for whom he secretly yearns. But Naomi tries desperately to keep her distance while protecting her younger siblings, Cari and Beto, both of who are gifted and soak up every advantage offered by their new school. Because Naomi is Mexican American, most of her classmates are disdainful with the girls insulting her intelligence and threadbare clothing and many of the boys dreaming of having sex with her. Their stereotypical ways of thinking are woven into the book's very fiber, making readers wince at every encounter Naomi has with someone at school. When she and her young charges are befriended by Wash Fuller, who is black and whose parents have dreamed and saved for his college education, they have no idea how important those friendships will become or what they will lead to. Of course, Naomi and Wash fall in love, and in West Side Story fashion, dream of finding a place where they can be together. Wash is almost too good to be true, patient, caring, always where he needs to be. But the relationship is doomed after the school for whites explodes from a gas leak, and the desperate parents of the youngsters who died in the explosion are looking for scapegoats. Based on the worst school disaster in American history, this is a story that will force readers to look into their own hearts to ponder how they might have reacted and how the book's many tragedies could have been averted. The author vividly depicts the mundaneness of Naomi's daily life and her constant struggles to keep herself safe even while lacking financial resources or any other options than living with the volatile Henry. As for me, I keep thinking about poor Beto, clutching his beloved cat Edgar as he hid in the back of that car headed toward San Antonio. I also shake my head in astonishment at the lies that are taken for truth in so much of our history.

Loosely based on a school explosion in New London, Texas in 1937 which took the lives of 300 children. Love, family, friendship, and hope for a better future come up against the ugliness of racism, hatred, misogynistic treatment of women, and a cruel mentality of mob rule. It's not an easy book to read, and I'm surprised that it has been marketed as YA rather than adult fiction. There are many tough, gut- punching scenes, keeping the reader squirming but still compelled to continue. Very few books find me turning back to the first pages as I did here, needing to look at them with fresh eyes. I've given very few 5 star ratings over the years, but this one demanded such. This would be an excellent fictional choice for someone studying the history of racism.

He is smart, kind, and always knows exactly what to say. He charms Naomi Vargas's twin siblings, and pretty soon Naomi as well. Naomi sees so much good in Wash, and finds him a wonderful distraction from her drunk step-father, Henry. But Naomi is Mexican and Wash is Black, and it's 1937, so they know they cannot be together. They hide their relationship from everyone, or at least they think they do. There are eyes everywhere though.I don't even know where to start. Even though I knew some of the events that were coming, I still cried more than once. Ashley Hope Perez wrote a story of true love and inexplicable hatred. There were characters I hated, knowing there were real people that were just like them in the 1930s, and unfortunately even today. There were also characters I loved and rooted for.

Tragedies like the ones that happened in this book we all know that in some form, they did happen in that time period. And we as a species still deal with racism and prejudice today. Out of the Darkness is a strong wake-up call to the darkness inside humanity and makes us reflect on who we are and the choices we make every day. The story was a beautiful, romantic tragedy. The ending made me cry, and I was also angry, but at the same time appreciative and grateful for reading this type of story. Out of Darkness will be the saddest book you have ever read.

Also vintage condoms!- Protagonists are from low-income families.A sign in the window of the local diner reads \u201cNo Negroes, Mexicans, or dogs\u201d, and it sets the tone for the rest of Ashley Hope P\u00e9rez\u2019s debut novel, Out of Darkness. Tackling subjects like integrated families, discrimination, interracial romance, and domestic abuse, this isn\u2019t a book for the faint of heart. (Considering this is published by Carolrhoda Lab, who put out the unforgettably brutal Drowning Instinct, this should probably come as no surprise.) Pleasant, light reading this book might not be, yet the story P\u00e9rez tells is nevertheless powerful and worth paying attention to.The historical backdrop for Out of Darkness is the 1937 school explosion in New London, Texas. The explosion killed nearly 300 people and is the deadliest school disaster in US history. Interestingly, I hadn\u2019t heard of it until picking up this book. What\u2019s really remarkable about the novel, though, is how the author has taken a single tragedy and created a richly woven, dynamic story to give it a human angle. We can read the facts about disasters until we\u2019re blue in the face, but when you turn it into a story with emotional appeal, it becomes that much more impactful.And even without the explosion, this book tells an excellent story. It is essentially a love story between a (relatively) well-off black boy, Wash, and an orphaned Mexican girl, Naomi. I was personally slow to warm up to both of these characters, but by the end I was pretty invested in their Happily Ever After. Or lack of one, I suppose. My favorite character, though, was Naomi\u2019s younger brother, Beto, whose conflict with his \u201cfeminine\u201d nature and his aggressive white father\u2019s expectations were subtly interwoven into the narrative. It added another layer to the repeated themes of societal pressure and bigotry that Out of Darkness deals with.Another thing I was impressed with was how mature P\u00e9rez was in dealing with subject matter. This is, obviously, a YA book, but it isn\u2019t one that treats its intended audience like idiots or people who must be shielded from realities. Just the sexual content alone had me impressed. Naomi experiences sexual abuse from her step-father and sex-related bullying from her white classmates (all Mexicans being dirty and promiscuous, after all). Though such scenes are sometimes difficult to read, I always appreciate an author who tackles them head on, instead of skirting around the issue. And more importantly, the author also portrays positive sexual experiences alongside the negative ones. Books that explicitly detail a rape but fade to black during consensual sex don\u2019t help anyone, in my opinion. Out of Darkness, happily, is not one of those books.All in all, I wouldn\u2019t say I liked this book or that it was one of the best books I\u2019ve read. However, Ashley Hope P\u00e9rez did an excellent job in creating an emotionally intense, historically informed story that touches on some themes and issues that the average YA novel steers clear of. Out of Darkness is a serious book that possibly will make you angry-cry, but it\u2019s worth it."}, {"userName": "grieshaber_reads ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5845130-grieshaber-reads", "userReview": "Actual rating: 4.5. After spending 8 hours reading this book (could NOT put it down), I am NUMB. Tragic, star-crossed lovers\u2019 story that cries out the darkness of humanity and whispers of hope. Author, Ashley Hope Perez, took a gut-wrenching event from history (one of which I was ignorant) and created a story from it (I love that). The event happened in East Texas in 1937. The New London school explosion killed nearly 300 children and teachers; it remains the worst school disaster in American history. When Perez learned that one of the dead was likely Hispanic (and probably hid this fact from the all-white, racist community), it sparked the idea for this story. The story opens with the explosion, then flashes back to the year before when the lovely, though quiet and mysterious, Naomi (Mexican) moves with her half-siblings (half-white), Beto and Cari (twins), to New London to live with the twins\u2019 father (Naomi\u2019s step-father). The tone of Naomi\u2019s story is ominous from the very beginning. It seems clear from the start that Henry Smith has a lot more than fathering on his mind when he asks Naomi to move into his home. The tightening of my stomach began there and stayed with me the entire time I read. Henry Smith is a despicable character who reminded me of Bob Ewell (the whole story had a bit of a Mockingbird feel to it). Aside from dealing with unwanted advances from her step-father, Naomi also has to deal with the town\u2019s prejudices, caring for her siblings, and sorting out her feelings for the handsome and charming, Wash, who is African American. You might think it would be okay for these two to be together considering they are both minorities, but you would be wrong. In 1937, you stick to your own kind. Naomi and Wash can\u2019t resist. They fall in love. The reader knows it\u2019s only a matter of time before they are found out and punished. It\u2019s no surprise when the explosion happens and all of the reader\u2019s worst fears are realized. But how it all comes down and what exactly comes down is thrilling yet unspeakable. I was literally walking around in slow circles while reading the last 50 pages of this book. I could not sit still. It\u2019s a hard read, but a powerful and extraordinarily written one. It\u2019s brutal, harsh, and graphic, but beautiful."}], "description": "\u201cThis is East Texas, and there\u2019s lines. Lines you cross, lines you don\u2019t cross.
