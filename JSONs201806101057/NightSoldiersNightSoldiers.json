For those of you that thought the period of European history between 1930 \u2013 1945 (give or take a couple of weeks) hadn\u2019t been mined for enough literary tale weaving, well, think again. Furst has written enough books about this era to choke John le Carre.I\u2019m not sure about the rest of the series, but his one\u2019s a corker.What\u2019s the book about?Simply put: Spy stuff.The protagonist, Khristo, a Bulgarian national, gets squeezed between the evil heavy-handed Fascists and the evil, sneaky Communists as each vie for the hearts and minds of the Eastern European countries they would eventually take turns steamrolling. Khristo\u2019s brother is killed by Fascist thugs and he gets recruited by Russia\u2019s NKVD and it\u2019s off to spy school to learn the basics.Khristo\u2019s spy career plays against the back drop of history \u2013 the Spanish Civil War, chic Paris of the late \u201830\u2019s, the French Resistance and the last days of World War II. Khristo gets caught up in the Soviet purges as Stalin\u2019s regime plays out like the snake that keeps swallowing its own tale expecting different results.Furst\u2019s attention to detail is a hallmark of the book; however, his need to squeeze in American characters via POV chapters can be a rocky ride.Kudos for going with Eastern Europe as the focal point rather than trotting out another English, American or French centric book.For those of you who like thrillers and/or historical fiction, check it out; it\u2019s a good combo of strong characters, high-tense action and stuff getting blown up.Three and a half stars rounded up."}, {"userName": "Austin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2697077-austin", "userReview": "If I had opened randomly to any point in this book and read 3 pages, I would have thought it to be a 5 star book. Furst is absolutely masterful at painting a scene, creating a mood, evoking a time and place, and fleshing out incredibly varied but wholly believable characters. If this were a movie, Furst would win an academy award for cinematography in a heart beat. But to my mind, he's a lousy director. Nothing propels the story forward from one of these wonderful scenes to the next. Several times, great detail went into explaining the back story and motivations of a character that then dies and is completely and permanently removed from the story moments later. Perhaps that artistically mimics the savage randomness of war where lives are snuffed out with no warning, but in a book it just disrupts the flow of the narrative. At first I thought this book was going to be wonderful, but in the end I only finished it out of stubbornness, long since having stopped caring what would happen.There is so much to respect here, but I just couldn't get into the story. That may not be the case for everyone. It should be noted that Furst's books are intensely researched so that the fictional goings on exist on an accurate back drop of historical events (both big and small). Also, his imagination for richly detailed characters who are very much a product of their times is nothing short of amazing. For a real WWII buff, I could imagine that Furst is tough to beat. From beginning to end, I really wanted to like this book, but I just never really did."}, {"userName": "Jan Rice", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice", "userReview": "This book centers on the Balkans--on their rebellious sons--from the years leading up to and through the Second World War.\"We are revolutionaries because we cannot stand any man who tells us what to do. The Turk sent his tax collectors, we sent them back a piece at a time.\".............................................................................\"The King sent special police to our town...and some fool shot them down. This fool hid in people's haylofts when the police came...but they started poking bayonets into the hay. So the fool moved up into the mountains. But they followed him there as well. One day came a Russian. We like such fools, he said, and he had false documents, a Soviet passport, and a train ticket to Varna, in Bulgaria, and a ticket on a steamer across the Black Sea to Sebastopol. So this fool--like all fools he thought himself wise--believed the Russian promises and left the mountains. ... Now you find him cheated of his victory.... ... But he accepts it. He takes everything they give out because he has no choice. He is like a bull with an iron ring through his nose. ...\"Sometimes the rebellious sons didn't even have to behave rebelliously. Stuff happened.\"Here, in this town, it will go on. You will not survive it. They murdered your brother; they must now presume you to be their mortal enemy, very troubling to keep an eye on. As the eldest brother, responsibility to even the score rests with you. With me or without me, Khristo Nicolaievich, you must go away. ...\"It would happen like the old feuds--one of mine, one of yours, until only one stood. Since Nikko's death, he had hidden this from himself.... ...\"Come with me,\" Antipin said, \"and I will teach you...how to hurt them. ... Your country has a sickness...and we know how to cure it. We have taught others, we can teach you. You yearn to see the world....\"And so the trap is set and sprung.Khristo sighed. The night made him sad. The history of Kulic's nation was like that of his own. The fighting never stopped. The conquerers kept coming. Other Kulics, other Khristos, all the way back through time, wandered the world. Away from love, away from home. They were destined to be eternal strangers. Melancholy aadventurers, guests in other people's houses. From now on, forever, there could be no peace for him....So, there's no exit for these boys seduced into the Soviet NKVD as can-do (and can't-quit) operatives.\"If you cannot go back, best go forward. What else is there?\"Night Soldiers is the first of fourteen (and counting) \"historical spy novels\" set in Europe in the period between the wars that Alan Furst has written. Other people's reviews had whetted my appetite for one. I also read the reviews of his most recent books; here's the NYT review of his newest. Chick lit this is not. Nor is it like All the Light We Cannot See or The Nightingale. Down you go, along darker and darker twists and turns, too far for any thread or pebbles to mark. Sometimes I could feel for the characters but sometimes they lost me. The book emerges from its dreamlike--nightmare-like--aura sporadically, really for the first time when an American girl is introduced. The hero(es) are almost infinitely-resourceful loners who, improbably, over the long term manage to spin a fragile web of brotherhood among themselves, there being no country or other lasting institution to receive their loyalty. Sometimes I was crying as the plot sped along--would the worst happen or could the protagonist possibly extricate himself? I could be a little unbelieving if disaster didn't strike. Is it \"dick lit?\" Surprisingly that term is not well defined. I thought it meant writing that appealed to men more than to women, but apparently dick lit is more narrowly construed as literature that appeals to men's love interests. Writer Steve Almond suggests here that men's work generally is less likely to be categorized. I think he's got a point when it comes to the topic of men looking for love: I haven't heard Of Human Bondage being called dick lit despite the protagonist's aspirations.In Night Soldiers, the Balkans along with their inhabitants are almost characters, too--the brutal suffering; the dashing (yet again) of their hopes for peace or some kind of normalcy, the passive exploitation. Peasant lives matter? Nyet. I liked it but it made me tired.Will I read another one? I do own two more--one that's said to be inferior and the other a good one. But I've gotta rest up for it."}, {"userName": "DoctorM", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175916-doctorm", "userReview": "Let's be straighforward and clear, darlings: \"Night Soldiers\" is one of the top ten spy novels of the last century.

In his grief and confusion, he is quickly taken in by a communist and finds himself heading upriver to Moscow where he is deposited, alone, at a school called The Brotherhood Front (of 1934). He is tossed in with the other comrades collected from all over Europe, within weeks, the reality of his situation comes crashing down upon him with a lesson and test that wipes out any remaining vestiges of his nescient , na\u00efve youthfulness. Disillusioned on his first mission to Spain and narrowly escaping one of Stalin's purges, he lands in Paris. In is a desperate dance against discovery from the Soviet secret intelligence service and the Germans, he will use everything the Soviet intelligence taught him to survive, fight and live. This is my second Furst novel, so I knew I was in for a gritty, taut, detailed and captivating read. My concern was would this be fresh? In the first book, the protagonist was an older, grizzled veteran and Furst style reflected and used this to great affect. I wasn't sure with this novel's protagonist being a teenager at the start and a much younger man throughout , if the author would be able to project the differences or just make his youth, wise beyond his years to fit the previous mold. I need not have worried. Furst deftly captures Khristo's disillusioned simplicity of youth and confusion at the world and his place in it. The narrative reflects the maturation process from idealized concepts, to forced realizations and acceptance. Furst has this subtle way of slowing down the taut pace, almost lulling the reader with the mundane concerns of day to day life, while still keeping an unstable, uncomfortable edge. This gives the reader a deeper understanding of Khristo's world and his reactions to it as we follow him in Russia, the Spanish Civil War, Paris and along the Danube. The River is very central to the story and also a symbol and allusion. I appreciated the map and frequently used it to follow Khristo throughout his journey and hope that it is available in every edition.The constantly shifting third person point of view adds to the pulse of the novel but could cause problems for some readers. Densely populated with many characters and locales all of which feel richly rendered, means the reader can't take anything or anyone lightly, it all needs and deserves your full attention. This may disappoint those looking exclusively for an action oriented story, although it is certainly has plenty of action, it is not central to the story. Instead this is an historical, action, adventure, thriller with a lot of heart, pain, loss, betrayal, joy and hope.I have gone ahead and purchased many more of Alan Furst's novels so that I will have them on hand, that way I'm ready to enter the shadowy world of espionage, spies, the resistance and an engrossing historical World War II read. His characters aren't easy to love, they don't fit into cookie cutter molds, they don't dress sharply and happily ever after isn't necessarily in the cards. They make mistakes then move on, they grab pieces of happiness when they can, where they can, they are moral yet imperfect, trying to survive and cope with a world that doesn't make sense to them anymore. Simply put, they are not easy to forget."}, {"userName": "G.J.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58061134-g-j", "userReview": "This rather long novel took some reading as it seemed at times rather dense, it required a bit of determination on my behalf not to keep leaving it in favour of other faster paced novels !

Furst's characters are full and realistic, his dialog is crisp and believable, the plotting intricate and logical. This book was a great, sprawling, epic story of a Bulgarian, Khristo Stoianev, recruited by the NKVD(Soviet secret police and forerunner of the KGB and FSB) in the lead up to the second world war. Stoianev falls victim to one of Stalin's irrational purges during Stoianev's operations in the Spanish Civil War. He escapes to France, closely pursued by his former NKVD colleagues, and hilarity ensues.I recommend this book to anyone even tangentially interested in spy fiction, the second world war or the inner workings of Soviet espionage organizations."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643002-paul", "userReview": "As a fan of John Le Carre, I have become increasingly skeptical in the face of constant comparisons made by the publishing industry between that author and anyone who writes a decent spy thriller. Le Carre is a commander of the English language; a master of subtlety and deft plotting who has an uncommon ability to imbue his characters with depth and a heroic realism. To my mind, the only author working today who can be truly compared to Le Carre is Alan Furst.Both men are heirs to Graham Greene, but where Le Carre's works often delve deeply into the emotions and alienation of so many of his characters, Furst dials that back somewhat - but only somewhat - in favor of absolutely rigorous historical verisimilitude. Night Soldiers is not Alan Furst's first book - he had a modest career spanning a number of novels before this work - but it is the premiere of Furst as a truly towering author in the espionage thriller genre. It follows Khristo Stoianev, a young Bulgarian who witnesses the murder of his brother at the hands of the local fascist militia in his pre-World War II homeland. Subsequently recruited by a Soviet agent, he is sent to Moscow to learn spycraft, but is soon disillusioned by the politics and ruthless purges of Stalin's Russia. What follows are a series of episodes that trace Stoianev's escape from Spain during the tumult of that country's civil war, his attempt at a normal life in 1937 Paris, his work with the French Resistance during the second world war, and a mad dash to save a friend in the final, bloody days of that conflict. Through these extended vignettes, we watch Khristo grow and change and struggle and adapt, all the while treated as readers to some of the very best writing in the business. As highly as I recommend Night Soldiers, however, be warned that, like Le Carre and like Greene, the author is not shy about providing action, but it is never the central element of the story. Likewise, the reader must be patient in watching the plot unfold and either familiar with a certain amount of historical fact, or open to becoming so. For those who are, Night Soldiers is intensely rewarding."}, {"userName": "Manray9", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7288965-manray9", "userReview": "Furst -- A Better Novelist Than HistorianI enjoy Alan Furst's novels. As many reviewers have stated (here and in the press), Furst is a master at depicting Eastern Europe in the interwar years. His strength is atmosphere. He paints a picture in words of the precariousness of life. As you read, you can FEEL yourself in Paris or Moscow or Madrid. You can SEE the characters, the cafes, and the seedy hotels. You can SMELL the Gauloises and TASTE the pastis.Furst's plots, however, are weaker -- with twists more than slightly unbelievable (Stoianev just \"happens\" to see the Brotherhood Front symbol painted on the half-sunken barge in the Danube). His cavalier approach to historical facts hurts his work too -- either he researches poorly or underestimates his readers. I am willing to grant him artistic license, but he dubs the POUM as an anarchist organization (POUM was \"Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista\" -- a Trotskyist group. One can't be both Marxist and anarchist). Since this was George Orwell's militia, described so eloquently in the renowned Homage to Catalonia -- Furst fails Spanish Civil War 101. He also speaks of Stoianev's girlfriend frequenting a cafe in Paris because Picasso and Modigliani are seen there. Modigliani died in 1920. She must have hoped to meet his ghost. Unfortunately, there are too many such lapses.Don't let me sound too strident. Furst's novels -- starting with Night Soldiers -- are good reading. I've read them all. They're solid Three Star material!"}, {"userName": "Lance Greenfield", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2793431-lance-greenfield", "userReview": "This book is underpinned by amazingly detailed research from which everybody can learn something.

He is sent to help the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, but soon finds himself in danger of becoming a victim of one of Stalin's purges, and flees to France.There are so many characters and locations in this book that it becomes very complex and difficult to follow. In my opinion, the story could have benefitted from being split into a trilogy of self-contained, but connected, stories.Although there were many gripping action-packed periods, and lots of intrigue and deception, I found myself trudging wearily through much of this book. It is very difficult to put my finger on what made Night Soldiers so laborious, as there is so much in it which should keep my interest, but that is just the way that the book took me.I am happy to have read Night Soldiers, but it has served to promote other books up my to-read list ahead of my next Alan Furst."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara", "userReview": "This story spans 1935-45 in Europe and centers on Khristo, a young Bulgarian, is recruited into the Soviet intelligence service after his younger brother is killed by fascists.

He speaks several languages and manages to survive because no matter who he encounters and interacts with, he is not seen as a threat. It made me aware that war was raging in Europe before World War II and the fight against fascism which started in Spain during the civil war spread across the continent as the threat was recognized.

The story moves to Russia, through the Spanish civil war and around Europe as WWII progresses. I enjoy how Furst develops characters and portrays Europe in the pre-war and during the actual war. His characters wander through momentous times and in the small way, as they deal with the events around them provide heroic actions.

I'd never heard of him until a New York magazine profile mentioned that the divinely prescient American Heritage editor Richard Snow, whose 1991 article in the NYTBR had rescued Patrick O'Brian from near oblivion, had anointed Furst his favorite historical novelist after O'Brian's passing. My beloved Charles McCarry also weighed in and I was hooked. And boy, were they right. While I prefer the earlier, longer novels like this one, every one is a gift to the reader. His theme is not spies so much but how fairly ordinary people trapped in extraordinary circumstances did their little bit.

This is the first. I do not think there is any reason to read these in order. Each book focuses on spies, but if the two I've read are any indication, take place in different settings with different characters. This on was twice as long as #10 and had a number of important characters who occasionally crossed paths. I do not recollect #10 being so complex. The primary main character is Khristo. He is Bulgarian. We meet him at the beginning of the book when he and his brother watch a troop of Bulgarian fascists marching down the street. A rather hilarious incident occurs that has bystanders trying to muffle laughter. Things get out of hand and Khristo's brother is executed and Khristo is made to watch. Soon a Russian infiltrator, a communist, convinces Khristo he must leave the country and Khristo finds himself in Russia. It is 1934. Khristo finds suddenly finds himself in the Russian intelligence service, fearing he will never be able to get out. First he finds himself in Spain in the middle of the Spanish Civil War, wondering why he was made to learn English and French and then sent to Spain. There is a regime change in Russia, as Stalin takes over. Khristo's spy partner and leader - Sascha - is caught up in this. Sascha, knowing he had been recalled, gives Khristo some tips. We see Sascha again much, much later.Khristo knows what he has to do to keep avoid the same fate as Sacsha and while disliking it, manages to survive to his first two encounters over accusations of his betrayal of Russia. Telling more of Khristo's fate would be to revealing but know that it is full of tension and maneuvering. Sometimes the book moves from action to narrative about what is going on in various places in the world at this time (1934-1945). Perhaps 1/3 through the book, we meet an America brought up in France who is bored with his job and doesn't really like his fianc\u00e9e. Through him we see how the OIC/OSS is created and works. There is a Russian troop commander who periodically shows up and allows to characters to show their \"character.\" There is an American Jewish woman who shows up during the Spanish Civil War, in Paris and later. This book was good. It might have been a bit better if streamlined a bit but I might not have had that reaction if I'd read in print, as sometimes in the audio I wanted to flip back the pages to remind me about a character who hadn't seemed too important when first met but then turns up again and then again.

A resounding yes. What better way to describe the motivation for a young man to want to fight for the NKVD, Stalin's secret police? Yes, there is some violence in this book, but not so much that you feel bloodied yourself.The novel is well-written combining characterization and plot. As with most spy novels, one must pay attention because not everything is as it seems. Furst reminds us with:But nothing here was what it seemed. Even the gray stone of the buildings hid within itself a score of secret tints, to be revealed only by one momentary strand of light. At first, the tide of secrecy that rippled through the streets had made him tense and watchful, but in time he realized that in a city of clandestine passions, everyone was a spy. Amours. Fleeting or eternally renewed, tender or cruel, a single sip or an endless bacchanal, they were the true life and business of a place where money was never enough and power always drained away. And, since the first days of his time there, he had had his own secrets.With this novel, I was given greater understanding of how much was lost by those who fought in WWII. Not just those who gave their lives, but, as importantly, by those who lived through it day by day, both civilians and those who served their governments in covert activities. The mute agony of these places - themselves lost in the silence of the endless, frozen land - would finish him if he permitted himself to feel it, so he had, by self-direction, grown numb, and now felt nothing about anything. There was no other defense.I have awarded this 5 stars and I might be feeling generous today. But certainly it is at the 4/5 line, either top of one group or bottom of the other.

There were parts of this novel that nothing in the world could tear me away from, and those were followed by longer parts that made me fall asleep while reading and forget to pick the book up again for weeks. The book follows one main character but will jump around to others often and treat each one like the start of a new novel and it never seems to come together in a way that makes it worth it. That was infuriating to get through. Also, the history is so deep that if you don\u2019t know it already, it doesn\u2019t make sense - there\u2019s a certain level of assumed knowledge that I couldn\u2019t meet (WW2 in Germany/Italy/Russia - I got it, Spain/Hungry/Bulgaria - not so much).

He witnesses the murder of his brother at the hands of the local fascist militia, and soon falls under the spell of a Communist. Fleeing Bulgaria he finds himself recruited by the NKVD, the forerunner of the KGB.There is much which makes this book stand out from the run of the mill spy novels. The only downside, for me, was that there was a tendancy to skip between characters and their various timelines. Making the book slightly confusing in parts. All in all an excellent read, and well worth digging out."}, {"userName": "Richard Wise", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2471166-richard-wise", "userReview": "This is, perhaps, my favorite of Alan Furst's masterpieces of WWII fiction. It traces the story of Khristo Stoianev, a Bulgarian peasant, as fate shoves him from his remote village along the Danube to a KGB training camp in Moscow to revolutionary Spain and from there to Paris.His journey is the journey from Facism to Communism and finally to a sort of redemption. Along the way he finds himself fighting in all the major theaters of the European war and we see how it develops through his eyes.A must, must read for anyone interested in WWII."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12839674-james", "userReview": "I don't know what I can possibly say about this book (or this series) beyond \"Alan Furst is brilliant.\" Or, as an older gentleman who saw me reading this book on the subway put it, \"He's something special.\" Indeed, and this book may be his best. The amount of detail woven so seamlessly into poetic descriptions, characters, situations, passages...it surpasses mere espionage or war or thriller and becomes something much more vital, a tapestry of hope and survival during one of the more brutal periods of modern history."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5276262-jim", "userReview": "Alan Fust has long been one of my favorite authors. Most of his other novels set in this period of pre-WWII to the end of the war were like snapshot of a time and place. This, his first novel, was a bit more rambling. Many of his others end abruptly, leaving you wondering about the fate of the characters. Here, he brings the characters to a conclusion at the expense of being concise."}, {"userName": "Dick Reynolds", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10283403-dick-reynolds", "userReview": "It\u2019s 1934 in Bulgaria when a young man is murdered by local Fascists. The victim\u2019s brother, Khristo Stoianev, is recruited into the NKVD, the Soviet\u2019s secret intelligence service. After training in Moscow, he\u2019s sent to Spain to serve in its civil war. About to become a victim of Stalin\u2019s purges, Khristo flees to Paris.\t But he soon learns that being a Russian spy is like being in prison. [I was reminded of the lyrics from a song about the Hotel California; \u201cYou can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.\u201d] Several examples follow.\tKhristo\u2019s training group adopts a homeless dog. One evening, the group is marched off to a theater to hear a long political speech. When they return to their quarters, they find that the dog is gone, along with all of its items, and the floor has been scrubbed with carbolic. The authorities did not want these young men to have any emotional attachments, a subtle clue as to the ruthlessness of their bosses. Later, during Khristo\u2019s time in Paris, he has a love affair with a woman and they live together for a short time. But one day he returns to their room and she\u2019s gone. Frantic, he searches for a note, some kind of clue. After tearing the room apart, he finally notices some marks on the old wooden wainscoting, four scratches that her fingernails had made when she was taken out the door.\tAt about the midpoint of the book, everything shifts from Europe to activities in the U. S. where the OSS is being formed. It\u2019s only a slight digression, however, as American businessmen are recruited and trained for clandestine operations in Europe. Rest assured that the story comes together nicely as the plot develops.\tAlan Furst\u2019s research of the period from 1934 to 1945 is excellent. He also develops the characters in a slow, methodical manner, making you care deeply about them along the way. Furst is also good with detailed settings, giving you the food\u2019s taste, the texture of cobblestones and the smells along streets after a rain. I\u2019ve been to Paris a number of times and his descriptions brought back pleasant memories of walks about the city and having coffee at sidewalk cafes.\tThe story is complex and gives the reader every incentive to take it slowly. Furst guides us through many European countries as we follow the wartime exploits of Khristo and his NKVD comrades. But the ultimate theme of the story is the loyalty and esprit forged by the members of his group in the heat of combat as they struggle for survival in the holocaust of war."}, {"userName": "Ioana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1721356-ioana", "userReview": "Calling this book a \"spy novel\" is doing it a grave injustice, and it also leads to readers who expect certain elements simply not present in this work (and hence, to lowered reviews). Night Soldiers is not a \"thriller\" or a \"mystery\", and does not subscribe to the beloved elements of the these genres: a strong, well-executed plot, a fearless protagonist who succeeds against all odds, and so on. Rather, this is a nuanced historical account of life (albeit, for NKVD recruits - hence the \"spy\" labels) during WWII. I simply adored this work for its realism, its attention to historical detail, its accuracy, and for the fact that it taught me more about the daily existence of people during this period than any history class/book ever has. Night Soldiers situates the protagonist and scores of minor characters all over Europe - we get to experience Paris, Basarabia/Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Spain, Poland, and more, in all their gritty non-glorious squalor and devastation during WWII. There are many reviews here complaining about the lack of \"plot\" - it's true, this novel is not about a master-espionage mission, but this is exactly what makes it a work of historical fiction (a well-written and copiously researched one at that), and not a typical \"thriller\". If you are interested in what life during WWII in Europe may have been like for scores of ordinary people, then this is definitely the book for you; if you are in the mood for an exciting plot complete with car chases, encoded secret messages, and the like, look elsewhere."}, {"userName": "Frank Stein", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein", "userReview": "I was disappointed by \"Blood of Victory\" by Alan Furst, but so many people told me to start at the beginning and go for the original that I gave this a try, and I'm glad I did. It's insightful and panoramic yet fast-paced, a real vision of World War II era Europe from Bulgaria to Russia to Spain to Czechoslovakia that still has a compelling plot and well-drawn characters. As many people point out, Furst also knows his background like no other writer. He describes the training of Soviet NKVD spies down to their barracks and games as if he went through it; he explores all types of Russian spy work with the Spanish Civil War partizans, from attacking German \"Condor Legion\" planes to ferreting out \"Fifth Columnists\" in Madrid, as well as Russia's later betrayals of the cause. Furst also plumbs the beginnings of the OSS and the CIA in Central Europe with real imagination and sympathy. After this book, I'm looking forward to reading more."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "One of those GREAT, sweeping spy epics. Furst stands right with le Carr\u00e9 (The Spy Who Came in From the Cold), Littell (the Company), and Mailer (Harlot's Ghost) in his ability to capture the ambiguity, color, temperature and texture of prewar Europe as well as the people and claustrophobia of War. I'm glad I decided to crack this spy nut. While there are segments here and there I didn't think were fantastic, on the whole, the entire novel was worth the time and the effort. Spy fiction doesn't get much better than this."}], "description": "Bulgaria, 1934. A young man is murdered by the local fascists.
