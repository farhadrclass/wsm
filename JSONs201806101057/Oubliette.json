It left me thinking about it for a long time after I put it down. I highly recommend reading it, if you haven't already. The author has a very strong hold on how to tell a story, and has a unique and original voice. I really liked the stream of consciousness flow and unedited quality of the first person narrative."}], "description": "Rising prison costs have led to a change in inmate management: set adrift in space with no hope of return.
