I hadn't intended to start a new book today; I intended even less to finish it. I picked up The Chicago Way as a quick distraction, imagining that I would read a few pages and then put it down for a few years until I had the time again. Instead, I found myself flying through the pages and finishing the book in a few hours.Michael Kelly, a former Chicago cop and current private detective, is hired by his old partner to work on an almost decade-old rape case. Almost immediately after Kelly is hired, however, his partner is found dead and the real mystery begins. This was satisfying for all the reasons that I read mysteries. The characters were intriguing and engaging. The mystery was quick yet intricate enough to not be obvious. The city was dark and gritty. There was a damsel in distress, and a dark, brooding detective with a history of his own. The perfect mystery for an afternoon of rain and tea.Recommend to anyone who enjoys a mystery."}, {"userName": "Larry", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2728477-larry", "userReview": "Michael Kelly is a Chicago cop-turned private investigator after having been railroaded off the force. His former partner, now retired, hires him to pursue a forgotten rape case that almost ended his own career. When the partner and client is murdered, and when Kelly is hired by the woman who was raped, things heat up. The deeper Kelly digs, the deadlier the case becomes. Kelly is a classic hardboiled p.i. The reviews of the novel often make reference to Raymond Chandler, but the atmosphere is more like Dashiell Hammitt. Though the writing can be hard-guy affected, it can also be powerful, and the plotting is impeccable. There are several interesting characters and enough heartbreak, past and present, to sink an ore ship in Lake Michigan. Kelly is complicated. What other p.i. reads Aeschylus in classical Greek or has the guts to play his hunches by crossing over the line as often as he does?This is a second reading for me, and I elevated it from three stars (blinded by the tough guy talk) to four (won over by the solid plotting). I was born on the South Side, and the Chicago sense of place is done very well.

Ex-cop Michael Kelly is now a P.I. whose former partner shows up at his door and tells about a case he wants to hire Kelly to work on, a rape that was being covered up by his superiors.Let me say that while I liked this book, there were some things that just didn\u2019t fit or seemed implausible: the blackmail, the raped hooker from an original crime, the killings that seemed to be, in the end, totally unnecessary. Many of these issues left me with a feeling that it could have been done with more subtlety. The prose is good and the dialogue often witty, but it\u2019s not enough to carry the story.One thing that makes this book unique in the annals of hard-boiled noir is the subtext of Greek tragedy. Kelly refers several times to the Greek trilogy Oresteia, quoting from the original Greek. (Having had Greek many decades ago in high school I feel somewhat qualified to despair over Hoye's pronunciation, but it was a long time ago.) The plays have to do with revenge and three women bent on that revenge.

(2007). Michael Harvey. ***.\tI recently read \u201cThe Third Rail\u201d by this author, of whom I knew nothing. I thought that that book was excellent and decided to read his earlier stuff, too. This was his first novel, and featured the character Michael Kelly, a P.I. and former cop (how novel!). In this first episode, Michael is approached by a former cop partner of his about a case he had worked ten or so years ago. It was the rape and murder of a young woman which was never solved. It was a cold case, but one which bothered his former partner. It turns out that the case wasn\u2019t so cold after all as bodies begin dropping all over the place. All of the fresh corpses seemed to be somehow related to the case in the past. Most of them were shot with a 9mm pistol. As Kelly begins to unravel the various clues, he too gets entwined in the morass of happenings, to the point where he becomes a pointer for the killer to his next victim. This novel showed a lot of promise, but if I had read this when it came out, I would not have been driven to read more. Turns out that I would have been wrong."}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1186024-toni", "userReview": "The Chicago Way is a brisk, entertaining read about a private detective and ex cop named Michael Kelly. I couldn't put it down once I began reading. Set in Chicago, the book is a love letter to The Windy City, and those familiar with the neighborhoods, politics, and media there will find themselves smiling--often. (Loved the joke at Chicago TV newscaster Jackie Bange's--pronounced \"bang!\"--expense--every guy I know has made the same or similar wisecracks about that name). My favorite line that shows Kelly's wry wit: \"He stopped renewing his license in 2004, when he did of a massive heart attack. Made sense to me.\" Reminded me of Robert B. Parker's Spenser. I didn't feel like I had a good sense of who Michael Kelly was by the end of the book, but I think that's okay; not telling all leaves more facets to reveal later and also something for the reader's imagination. I also liked how the theme of the story--here, sexual assault--is woven throughout the fabric of the story and viewed from multiple angles, whether investigators on the scene, activists raising money for awareness and prevention, or the stories and memories of victims and the horrific toll this horrific crime exacts on its victims. His depiction of the loneliness of Kelly's existence was also superbly done. [This next sentence is slightly spoiler-ish in that it reveals how the story wrapped up--no detail is given, however] I'd say the main thing I didn't like was that the characters all came together a little too neatly at the end, each serving a purpose integral to the mystery itself; it felt a bit more contrived than I'd expected from this story. That won't stop me from reading Harvey's subsequent novels, however; I finished his second Michael Kelly mystery in the same week I read The Chicago Way."}, {"userName": "Sandie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1331967-sandie", "userReview": "For this reader Michael Harvey's freshman venture into the hard-boiled crime drama genre is more James M. Cain than Dashiell Hammett and the hero is more Dana Andrews in Laura than Humphrey Bogart. If compared to the noir movies of the 40's the reader is left with a picture of Robert Mitchum or Sterling Hayden as the protagonist Mike Kelly, Barbara Stanwyck as Elaine Remington and Lauren Bacall as Diane Lindsey. Today casting directors would probably give us Gerard Butler, Cameron Diaz, and Nicole Kidman in those parts. The story is a fascinating patchwork of Chicago settings from the Drake Hotel ballroom to the back alleys of the windy city \"burbs\" with bleak pessimistic observations on everything from serial killers, politics, race and gender to pondering observations of ancient Greek philosophers. Unlike many writers today who feel obligated to fill 500 plus pages with entire chapters describing the color of the sky, Harvey's background in journalism and television documentary production is obvious in his writing style. His sparse \"who, what, where, when, why and how\" approach to storytelling is a good thing. He hooks you from chapter one, succinctly gives you the information you need while moving the story along at a healthy clip. Things never get boring and the plot never lags as we play \"armchair shamus\" to Mike Kelly's real deal. This is a better than average debut and I look forward to another walk on Chicago's wild side in the company of PI Mike Kelly. 3 1/2 stars"}, {"userName": "Michael  Polino", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7318847-michael-polino", "userReview": "Cool title, cool cover art... Maybe the worst book I have ever read. I'm generally pretty forgiving and easy to please with anything either crime noir or Chicago-centric but this was so bad that my mouth was sweating the entire twenty-five minutes it took me to read it. The book is written as though the author visited the city for a convention, went to a Cubs game, drank a few MGD 64s at one of the meat head bars in Wrigleyville,then went a few blocks over to Boystown for action on the DL. Then, thoroughly infatuated with the whole entire city of Chicago, (meaning the few tourist traps that he visited and, of course, nothing south of Roosevelt) but also needing to prove his masculinity after his aforementioned bi-curious adventures, he got back to his room at the Hilton and decided he needed to write a REAL old school CHICAGO detective novel with a really super tough super douche main guy with a really great original name.

Of course, it does feature real \u201clandmarks\u201d like the Golden Apple restaurant and a few local watering holes (including the Hidden Shamrock where Harvey is part-owner if I\u2019m recalling correctly), but it isn\u2019t quite as rich in local color as Sara Paretzky\u2019s work. It does, however, have the requisite amount of city level corruption for a locale known both historically and in the present as a hotbed of government corruption.Michael Harvey, at least before this debut novel was published, was best known for his work on Cold Case Files, the Arts and Entertainment Network\u2019s documentary. In the course of his work, he was able to interview serial killers such as John Wayne Gacy and, naturally, when he draws from real life, there is a serial killer in the novel who resonates horrifically with Gacy (though said character is definitely a composite character and not merely Gacy himself). So, aptly enough, The Chicago Way begins with a \u201ccold case file\u201d and escalates. This isn\u2019t the typical \u201ccold case file.\u201d It doesn\u2019t appear to have merely been forgotten and ignored; it seems to have been obfuscated and deliberately hidden. And that\u2019s just the beginning.Mike Kelly is the genre\u2019s typical hard-case P.I. with a background on the police force. In one of the tropes of the genre, his departure from the force was not a gentle retirement with mutual respect. There\u2019s a background here that the reader has to discover. In another trope of the genre, there is an individual in authority who was either responsible for or a true believer in the circumstances surrounding Kelly\u2019s rough departure. Naturally, said authority has the ability to get in the way.Then, there is the drop-dead, gorgeous love interest of the story, an anchorwoman who seems to have sources inside the police department which are too good to be true. Kelly is trying to move on beyond a rough break-up (a previous relationship which took place \u201coff-stage\u201d in the protagonist\u2019s past but encounters him in two short but interesting scenes in the novel) and the anchorwoman provides some promise in moving on. She even introduces him to a charity that helps rape victims move on with their lives and one senses that there is more to her than her \u201con-air\u201d presence and the fact that she seems to have better sources than she should. Alas, for those who have read my complaints with regard to other books about \u201cQuincyitis,\u201d the tendency to interrupt this story for a \u201csermon\u201d on social ills, the charity event provides a \u201cquick hit\u201d opportunity to inject some \u201cQuincyitis\u201d into the story. Fortunately, it is very relevant to the advancement of Kelly\u2019s own understanding and mercifully, it is deliberately very short.I can\u2019t really share any more about the misdirection and \u201cAgatha Christie\u201d moment (the \u201creveal\u201d which seems inadequately foreshadowed that was so brilliantly parodied in the film, Murder By Death) without providing spoilers (I hope I haven\u2019t already). Suffice it to say that the book is realistic enough that I want to read more and that The Chicago Way pours a foundation for even better things in the two sequels which are now out. I\u2019ll be reading them and hoping for less \u201cAgatha Christie\u201d and more Michael Harvey. The insights he injects into the story are welcome, but uneven\u2014making me a fan, but not a fan-boy."}, {"userName": "Andre", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2877069-andre", "userReview": "I bought The Chicago Way by Michael Harvey several months ago because Amazon had it on sale for cheap.

Harvey\u2019s private investigator protagonist, Michael Kelly, is has a life filled with next level sadness. As I said to my wife, the best way to describe how rough Kelly\u2019s life has been is that he\u2019s a White detective in Chicago whose life-long best friend is a Black woman. Yeah, it\u2019s that bad.Kelly is a 35-year old private investigator who was formerly a detective with the Chicago Police Department. The case at the heart of The Chicago Way is a nine-year old rape of a woman named Elaine Remington. Kelly is approached by his former partner for help solving the case. Fighting for Elaine costs Kelly pretty much everything that matters to him, yet he never backs down. Even though he must meed the Chicago Mob and fight enemies in the District Attorney\u2019s office, Kelly uses every single resource at his disposal\u2014legal or not\u2014to find answers. Throughout this novel, the reader gets to see all the reasons why Michael Kelly is a great detective and a pretty bad everything else.Following the lead of its main character, The Chicago Way is one of the sadder detective novels I\u2019ve ever read. Without giving anything away, I can say that everything in Kelly\u2019s life takes a pretty sharp downturn in this novel. If he possessed the ability to step outside of himself, I\u2019m not sure he would even want to solve the case that is at the center of The Chicago Way. One could argue that Kelly\u2019s persistence in closing a case is nothing more than masochism. Even in the end, in the novel\u2019s final scene, Kelly undertakes his most masochistic quest.The Chicago Way is gritty. It\u2019s hard and edgy and dark. And it deals with rape and murder and pedophilia. This is not some cute Hollywood detective story. It\u2019s grim, and not very hopeful. And it\u2019s all Chicago.As with any mystery, there are twists and turns. I didn\u2019t figure them all out before they came, and that\u2019s a good thing. In most cases, I only saw them a matter of moments before the detective did. In some cases, I was wrong. I like that. The Chicago Way was a fully satisfying read.I know that Michael Harvey has written two Michael Kelly novels that follow The Chicago Way. I will begin reading the next one right away.

In addition to taking place in Chicago there are also crooked civil servants, a brief appearance by the mob, and a new client tied to an old case. Michael Kelly, Harvey\u2019s principle character, reads like the Sam Spade archetype come true. A former cop and current PI, he has the traditional sarcastic wit, limited personal attachments, and excellent sleuthing skills one would want of a detective. Despite the traditional form, this novel is far from clich\u00e9 or uninteresting.I found the plot to well-paced and very engaging. It was very easy for me to be drawn in and want to keep going. It followed the form just enough for me to love the gritty feel of the seedy side of Chicago but had enough originality to make me happy.

He gathers a team of intelligent friends of his that could contain information and aid in the solving of this case. Through multiple tragedies and unexpected twists, Michael Kelly needs to discover leads to solve this cold case. I read this book because it was given to me as a present from my father, who is aware of my interest to become a detective and solve murder mysteries. I have always been fascinated by fictional and real life tales of cold cases, so to add this one to my bookshelf got me really excited. I expected this book to be extremely good right away, as I saw that Michael Harvey was the author and I have enjoyed all of his past mystery novels. This book definitely met my expectations because every time a lead seemed to be going well and an seemingly impassable obstacle stood in the way, Michael Kelly always found a way around it. I can personally connect to Michael Kelly's method of thinking because he is always looking for loopholes of evidence and using outside-the-box thinking to try to crack open this case.Throughout the novel, Harvey dropped subtle hints that wouldn't have been given a second thought to even an avid reader. He would provide seemingly useless pieces of information about the case, that only became clear at the end. His use of foreshadowing throughout the book provides a spooky theme throughout the book, and whenever I expected something to happen, the exact opposite would occur.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading from the mystery genre.

Blindsided by events at every turn, there is nothing predictable in this novel, a macabre twist added just when it\u2019s coming together. Juggling all the angles and the twists is not an easy feat, but Harvey is succinct, the brutality swift and shocking, the protagonist barely one step ahead of the one man who keeps a desperate secret in this fast-paced noir and social commentary. It is also a classic who-dun-it as the bodies start piling up and the identity of the killer remains a secret. When, finally, all is revealed, the climax is far from what could have been predicted. It\u2019s a heady combination of an action thriller and a murder mystery. The hero, Michael Kelly, is a flawed hero with a keen interest in Greek literature. There is a realistic description of Chicago\u2019s underbelly. Overall, it\u2019s a good series opener. A fast paced story with enough twists and turns and a great climax."}, {"userName": "Gloria", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1110862-gloria", "userReview": "You can almost hear Chicago's El train in this hardboiled mystery that features many actual locations in the city. A street-smart former cop, now private detective, is contacted by his one-time partner to assist with a cold case rape crime. When the ex-partner is murdered, Michael Kelly uses personal connections to reveal many layers of deception that take readers into the seediest neighborhoods and the highest echelons of Chicago society.The author uses a plot-line similar to the true story of serial killer, John Wayne Gacy. Girls are either raped or murdered. Some disappear. Others are ignored by the court systems. Many variations of age, race, physical appearance, location, education and income levels are represented in this examination of sexual assault. The crimes may be cold, but the quickly developing world of forensic testing sheds new light on old crimes in this gritty mystery. The author is a co-creator of A&E's Cold Case Files and succeeds in giving this story a true crime tone in the style of Raymond Chandler's famous character, Philip Marlowe. Beautiful, enigmatic women and brushes with Chicago's dark side create an intriguing mystery with a striking twist at its culmination.
