I think the blend of witch craft, a different kind of supernatural world, and of course the fae, all somehow make such an interesting read that I can't help but be sucked in by it. And while this series isn't unique in design, it does have some very unique elements and therefore, holds its own in the urban fantasy genre.With a rag tag bunch of friends and people who aren't quite friends and not quite enemies, this series really is a fun one. With old faces (yay Briar!), new adventures, and a little bit of heartbreak along the way, this was a solid addition to the series and while I still wish somethings about Alex, would finally be mentioned and cleared up, it was nice to see Alex develop her powers and use them in new unexpected ways. With an ending that was less than happily ever after, it will be interesting to see where the author takes Alex, her love interests, and her friends next. This continues to be a series that I can count on for a fun time and will always give me a bit of the unexpected and unanticipated. *ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Kira", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7247640-kira", "userReview": "Oddly this felt like a standalone. All the usual characters were there, but all of their roles were fairly insignificant except for Alex. Alex worked on an interesting case with Briar the bitch. Man I hated her! The case was the focal point of the entire book. Only one remotely significant thing happened in relation to the overarching plot. It was weird. All of the drama with faerie and the soul collectors was largely forgotten. It was mentioned but didn't go anywhere. I liked the book but was expecting to get more out of it. The love triangle drama pissed me off. Actually there was next to no drama. That was part of the problem. Things are clearly going badly with Alex and Death. Why is Alex so blase about it? He's supposed to be her oldest friend, one of her best confidants. They've put their lives on the line for each other several times. I know Alex is afraid of commitment, but this is ridiculous. Couldn't there at least be a valid reason for their ambivalence towards each other? Death is probably doing it as a reaction to Alex's behavior. Alex hates it that Death can't tell her certain things although she knows he has rules he must follow. The situation with Falin is no different. He's beholden to the fae queen. Both of the men in her life are someone else's puppet. Why doesn't she just pick one instead of picking one then doing nothing but focusing on petty bullshit? The whole situation is frustrating. It was handled poorly in this installment. The romance was barely there, which was fine, but when it was, I felt nothing but detached. I wanted more from this. The world is fascinating, but there wasn't any growth or progress. Honestly I'm not looking forward to the next one. I will read it, but I'm not excited at all."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5375148-beth", "userReview": "I really enjoyed Price\u2019s storytelling and I love the characters, the gang is all here but I don\u2019t see much deeper developments with anyone in particular\u2026especially after that ending.New twists and an unexpected turn or two, that are sure to leave a few scars.

Alex spent most of her time being everyone's doormat/punch bag.

I'd honestly rather Alex was unapologetic and self serving. Didn't like how Death/Alex's relationship was handled, it seemed like the author just wanted to write him out and make him a bit part character.

So I cracked this baby open with glee ready to find out what new cases Tongues for the Dead would be tackling. Right from the offset Alex is dragged into an unusual situation with a soul inside a dead body that clearly doesn't belong to it! As if that wasn't spooky enough soon other animated corpses show up hell bent on theft and pretty soon Alex crosses paths with the reapers whose job it is to claim those souls. You just know it's all going to go pear shaped but still Alex has to make a stand even if that means she's on the wrong side of 'Death' her lover! I love this series and yet this time it lacked a little something for me. The action and mystery was fabulous because crazy necromancers always have a lot up their sleeves and this time it's both heinous and more than a little poignant. My problem is I wanted more of 'Death' , Alex's protector and boyfriend. He has sacrificed so much for her previously that I'd really hoped they would actually get a happy ending but as this book ends I'm definitely not a happy reader.Still I do enjoy the crazy family that Alex has created and this time the gangs all here! Plus Alex is learning more about her own heritage and powers which are truly tested here . The fact that her ex lover Falin is constantly around acting as a spy for his Queen just adds to the tension and the word frenemy has never been more appropriate as Alex treads a wary path between freedom and the Fae court. Plus in this book we get a lot more of total bad ass Briar and trust me that's one scary lady. Lots of twists to keep me turning the pages but that end whilst not totally unexpected leaves me wondering just what will happen next?This voluntary take is of a copy I requested from Netgalley and my thoughts and comments are my honest and I believe fair opinion"}, {"userName": "Ally ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4644552-ally", "userReview": "Why is the 5th book coming out BEFORE the 4th book?

But really this just seemed like the author was like, welp I need to keep my readers interested so let's just throw this bland book in and add just enough interest to keep them hooked till the end. Don't get me wrong though I love the story and the characters and was it entertaining, well sure. But it was just like the whole book and characters where stuck in limbo, no actual growth was seen except a small trickle. (You'll have to read the book and see for yourself) just kinda tired I guess of the whole everyone walking all over her, and pretty much fucking with Alex's life. It's like she's in a rollercoaster and someone else has the controls , she's just along for the ride. Also the whole love triangle thing, getting tired of it too since there's no new information of who death is, what his end goals are, and Falin is the same story. At least Falin is marginally more involved and takes care of her but does he do it for her or because he's the queens bloody hand? I think the only thing that I was really like holy shit that's cool was the castle, wish I had my own faery castle! Also does anyone else think that Briar is an annoying bitch, god I wanted to put my fist in her face a couple times. I think literally my thoughts after I finished reading the book where, wow this book was sad, and not like oh wow it's heart wrenching sad it made me feels all sorts of emotions. No it was the bad kind of sad that made me feel like I don't really want to read the next book. If it weren't that I genuinely like Alex Craft and her world I probably wouldn't read the next , but alas I do and I'm hoping for a better 6th book."}, {"userName": "RachelW (BamaGal)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31722634-rachelw-bamagal", "userReview": "Very nice entry to the series. Price is (so far) staying true to the tone of the previous books. The case this time...well, there's several things going on; but it starts when a young woman hires Alex to find her missing boyfriend. When Alex does find him, it's just in time to see him killed...and a female ghost pops out of his body. Alex spends most of the book working with the magical crimes agent Briar Darque. There are lots of twists and turns as they try to get to the bottom of the mystery. There are also a lot of weird happenings that left me wondering, even as I knew it would lead back to the original case eventually. It just seemed to take an inordinately long time pulling the threads together. Still, it was all good and I enjoyed the read. It's definitely an inventive tale with very good wordbuilding.It's taken me until this book to realize what is different about this series from other series of this type. There is really not much in the way of an overarching plotline to the series; there is just a new case to be solved each book. Sure, the gang is all there; and the vagueness of the love triangle, but these things are never deeply explored. It's just the case at hand. Not that this is a bad thing, mind you; it's just an observation.

So much so that while the last book came out only last year, I felt like it was such a long wait for GRAVE RANSOM. The \"wait\" was worth it though! GRAVE RANSOM had a wonderfully twisty and unique plot that was pretty fun to work through along with Alex.Alex, being a grave witch, has a unique way to work with the dead and I love reading the descriptions of just how she is able to see on a different plane of existence, raise shades, and talk to ghosts. What is really neat about Alex's case in GRAVE RANSOM is how a simple missing person mystery snowballs into some complex web involving dead bodies who were alive but not exactly zombies or ghouls of any sort.Another aspect I love about this series is the use of Faerie and the fae. It would almost feel like too much detail to include a magical faerie castle in a pocket dimension, various magical realms, and fae rules along with everything else in this book. But it doesn't feel like too much. It actually fits neatly into the story and Alex's constant learning about her heritage actually helps her with this case.GRAVE RANSOM possesses a wonderfully vivid story full of action and magical mayhem that will leave you wanting more. I love seeing how Alex has evolved over this series and after the events of GRAVE RANSOM, I am looking forward to seeing where she goes from here."}, {"userName": "Melliane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3166645-melliane", "userReview": "Mon avis en Fran\u00e7aisMy ENglish reviewI always enjoy all the volumes of the series and I was curious to launch myself in this new volume. Well, it\u2019s true that my memory wasn\u2019t that good regarding the story, but I still had a great time.We therefore find Alex for a whole new story. She, who thought she already saw everything, will face many new problems. Indeed, it would seem that bodies are wandering with souls that are not theirs. And of course, Alex is often around when this happens! Passing from suspect to police adviser, the young woman will attract more attention than she would have liked. She will have to push her powers to the maximum to discover the truth!I enjoyed following the survey and I was curious to know the reasons for all these experiments. Everything that these bodies do seems very strange and it is true that I did not expect such an explanation. Alex also has to deal with the problems of her personal life and especially with Falin, or even Death. We know that her relationship with Death is tricky and we will see how fine the limits are as well. It was, however, a pleasure to see them both.The end of the story saddened me but I am curious to see what will happen now.

Even ones that start out intriguing at first. Even ones where you aren\u2019t immediately sure who you\u2019re rooting for.You know why? Somebody\u2019s got to lose. And there is a 50% chance that the HEA you\u2019re rooting for is going to crumble at your feet.All that in mind, I hated the ending of this book. It made me mad and it mad me sad and I hate-tweeted about it seconds after I was done. I\u2019m going to try not to let all of that shadow the rest of my review, but I had to give you total disclosure. It\u2019s a day later and I\u2019m still unhappy.Backing up. I have been a fan of the Alex Craft books since I read book one. Kalayna Price has created a cool premise that mishmashes a bunch of UF elements and made something that stands up well on it\u2019s own. Alex Craft is a grave witch. She can raise the shades of the dead and learn their secrets. Over the course of previous books, we\u2019ve learned she is also fae (news to her!) and a \u201cplaneweaver,\u201d able to see and manipulate other dimensions. All of these elements come together here, and while you might be able to enjoy it as a new reader, why would you want to? The early installments are awesome. Start with Grave Witch.Basically, Alex is a private investigator of sorts, hired to ferret out information from the deceased. Here, she is hired by a teenage girl to find her missing boyfriend and determine whether he\u2019s dead or alive. What should have been a simple case turns out to be anything but when it reveals someone is abducting people, killing them, and putting other souls in the bodies in order to do his dirty work. It\u2019s dark and there\u2019s a lot of death and decay action happening, but it\u2019s really awesome. I loved the mystery. I also loved how Price tied all the threads together that I didn\u2019t even realize were hanging. It was action packed and kept me engaged from beginning to\u2026 (well, you know how I felt about the end.)I like Alex a lot. I know I\u2019ve said this before, but it \u2013A\u2013 bears repeating and \u2013B\u2013 is still true. A lot of UF heroines \u201cevolve\u201d so much over the course of a series, they are almost unrecognizable as the characters they were at the beginning. Not so here. Alex may know more about herself, and she can do more stuff, but she is still the same woman. The books still have the same vibe. I really appreciate that.Both Death and Falin are around in small roles. Neither romantic plot takes up a lot of page time, but it is going somewhere. I\u2019ll leave it at that.Angry and grumbly as I am, I begrudgingly admit this was a good book and it\u2019s a great series. I still recommend it.

I was in no way compensated for this review.I am happy to see that the Alex Craft series is back in action! Kalayna Price is an amazing author and I always love returning to her worlds. Grave Ransom is the latest adventure Alex and her friends partake in, and let me tell you, there are zombies!! Okay, they\u2019re considered reanimated corpses, but come on, it\u2019s zombies!! Naturally I couldn\u2019t really remember what\u2019s happened with Alex lately. Even though I\u2019m back on track with being a year in between reads, this was before my notorious notetaking! Thankfully, though we do get some continuance of personal details with characters, this is still a series where every book is a fresh start. At least in the continuity area, the series continues to have a one and done mystery per book with just a few little things that carry over through each book, so my memory loss isn\u2019t the death of me with this one, thankfully! LOL!Alex soon discovers that there\u2019s someone around town who is raising shades and putting them into other dead bodies. Basically ghosts are inhabiting bodies that aren\u2019t their own and are running errands for this mysterious necromancer. When Alex also takes a case to locate a missing person, a teenage boyfriend from the girlfriend who says he\u2019s gone missing, she\u2019ll quickly learn that the cases are related. And as more and more reanimated bodies continue to show up, committing crimes, no less, the hunt for the alleged necromancer takes underway.I love how fresh and different this series is! It\u2019s not like any other I\u2019ve read before. And I read a lot of paranormal books! Lol! It\u2019s sad to say that the Urban Fantasy genre is slowly dying down. It had its heyday a few years back and I was in heaven! And then suddenly the books all started coming out less and less. Sometimes it\u2019s authors wanting to write something different after so many years and other times it\u2019s due to low sales. This saddens me. I frequent between my YA and adult read and seeing a lack of Urban Fantasy books, the genre that I turned to once I saw a lack of Paranormal YA books, kills a piece of my soul. It\u2019s just not fair. But I am pleased that I have series that are still in the running like the Alex Craft series!This is Urban Fantasy at its purest! You have a kickbutt heroine who\u2019s got a bit of snarky side\u2014which is my personal favorite kind of trait, a world filled with magic, there\u2019s ghosts, fae, Death! It has so many wonderful paranormal elements! The plots are always engaging and are always more than what they appear to be at surface glance! There\u2019s great relationships between friends and lovers. Alex is still trying to make a relationship with Death work, while also knowing her former lover, Falin, still works for the faery queen! It\u2019s rife with tension.Also being Urban Fantasy, the romance and its many complications, is only a vague part of the story. And this is why I turned to Urban Fantasy all those years ago. I kept finding Paranormal Romance books and expected Urban Fantasy out of them instead they always surrounded the plot on the romance, here in Urban Fantasy the romance is merely an element of the story. Although, that being said, I was kind of upset Death wasn\u2019t around more. Sure he\u2019s busy being an agent of Death and all. And it\u2019s not that I was looking for the \u201clovin\u201d moments, but just Death himself. But as I recall he was an infrequent visitor to Alex\u2019s life which can be a problem.Alex continues to navigate her newfound fae nature (that might have been more than a few books back, but it does seem she\u2019s still learning the ropes and is coming into her own) with her friends beside her. She\u2019s adapted to some of the new things pretty well, though sometimes the urge to say \u201cthank you\u201d still comes up! I know I would likely never be able to get over that one! I was raised to be polite, what can I say?! LOL!Grave Ransom is the latest in the incredible Urban Fantasy series, Alex Craft, by Kalanya Price! This is not one to be missed for it\u2019s an epic and smashing read! I cannot wait to read more from this series as Kalayna has already been cemented as one of my favorite authors years ago with her other series Haven!

And yet I'm annoyed with Grave Ransom, and not because Price uses first-person protagonist point-of-view from Alex\u2019s perspective. Instead, it was all the tell. The only time Price pulled me into the story was Remy\u2019s tale. For the rest? It was simply words to get through.Past stories in the Alex Craft series have been rich with action and characters. This one not at all. It\u2019s bare of much of this with only a small core of characters and settings, and even that is sparse with very little said about them. Nothing about their lives or what they are. Let alone last names\u2026?? I think the final cap on my disappointment was Price\u2019s treatment of Death. Or, rather, Alex\u2019s abuse of him. I get why she did it, and Death\u2019s behavior is partly to blame. Lord knows I don\u2019t remember him being so intransigent before when Alex needed help! But it was a weak effort that Price should have put more thought into to make it believable. Taylor's only reaction at the end was also weird.Alex\u2019s condition also annoys me. And, that is totally not fair of me. She can\u2019t help being a grave witch. Nor can she help what those ramifications are, although I do wish, again, that she hadn't gone on and on and on about it.Yeah, it\u2019s an interesting story with some horrible ramifications, and Alex does makes a leap in her understanding (and use) of her abilities. It\u2019s too bad that Price never did make me feel much of any emotion for it.The StoryThe dead are walking in Nekros, stealing, robbing, and more.

Her body is facing into the cover but her face is turned to us, as if daring us to enter that spooky wrought iron gate standing ajar, leading into a misty, grayish-blue-purple graveyard. The author\u2019s name is in a shadowed white roman font at the top. The title is in italics in a pale lime green with its own shadows, crossing Alex\u2019s torso. The series information is in white at the bottom right and framed by purple scrollwork, top and bottom.The title is the \u201cbribe\u201d used on the volunteers, a Grave Ransom that holds false promises."}, {"userName": "Danielle (Danniegurl)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10879719-danielle-danniegurl", "userReview": "[ Death again (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Amyiw", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6396633-amyiw", "userReview": "4 1/2So this one was really good for me. A true UF. It didn't concentrate on the triangle of her death and Falin. As I've always said, neither is good for her as Falin is owned by the Queen, and death never can be open with her. They are good transitions but nothing more IMO.So with the love life not the center of attention we get a great mystery that has lines on multiple fronts. If you read the anthology Kicking It, you would've been introduced to Briar and her partner. I really like these two but think that Briar did some thing really questionable in this one. I still really like her character and wonder if the side series will every emerge.Alex has to find out how and who is putting souls in other bodies and keeping alive with magic. And the end game of why? I thought the over all plot was really good and it kept me interested throughout. Very happy after the last one that really was Meh."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3986674-amanda", "userReview": "SO GOOD.

Alex and Rianna have a pretty good business going and balance each other out nicely. Rianna is the spell caster and raises shades mostly, while Alex takes on cases that don\u2019t involve using her grave witch, able to see/feel/speak to the dead, capabilities.All grave witches take a hit on their eye sight when they use their powers but for Alex it is magnified. In addition to being a grave witch Alex is also a plane weaver, able to see onto different planes of reality, and that combination is harder on Alex\u2019s eyes. In fact, in some cases uses her grave witch powers gives her temporary blindness. As if that were not enough it was also recently discovered that she is Fae as well. There is a lot going on with this character.Her client, Rachel, is a teenager that has hired Alex to find her missing boyfriend. This should have been an easy enough task. With the help of her partner\u2019s skills in spell casting, Alex is able to use a charm that allows her to track the boyfriend. Nothing about this missing person case makes any sense as from the start Alex feels as if the charm is sending her in two different directions. As it turns out, this is no easy missing persons case. There is foul magic in play and Alex is up against a necromancer that will stop at nothing to achieve their goal.If things weren\u2019t tough enough, brought in to investigate the crime of who is using reanimated corpses to commit robberies across the city, Briar Darque of the Magical Crimes Investigation Bureau enlists the assistance of Alex in the most heinous way. Forced into a tumultuous partnership with Briar which quickly becomes a two for one deal when Falin steps in to provide protection for Alex. He is under an obligation to his Queen to make sure that no harm befalls Alex and when it becomes apparent that Briars actions put Alex in harm\u2019s way he is forced into the position of her bodyguard. Between you and me though, I think he does not really mind at all \ud83d\ude01.Now Alex must work with the authorities to solve the mystery of why people are being raised from the dead in order to carry out the whims of a sinister mastermind. This is a foe that will tax the limits of Alex\u2019s strength as well force her into challenging what she believed was the extent of her abilities. Through this testing, it becomes clear that Alex is stronger than she ever knew. With the aid of her friends and her boyfriend, Death, Alex embarks on a dangerous quest to get to the bottom of this mystery.There is a bit of a backstory with this novel. Alex is Fae but she has been given independent status but it also comes with her past \u201csometimes\u201d lover Falin being forced to reside in the castle that was given to Alex. This castle has been annexed out of limbo and into the mortal realm which is now connected with the house that Alex has lived in for the past several years. She has a current love interest, known as Death, but they are breaking all the rules by being together. All of this is woven throughout the story but really the main plot of the book is the case. Everything else just adds to the story.I really liked that Grave Ransom did not get bogged down by trying to add too much extra material. I liked the idea of the castle being both in the mortal realm but still connected to the fae realm. I loved the ideas that had been introduced there but I wish that part had been developed more. I would have loved to have seen what happened with the gardens. The ending was not what I expected but it did leave room for future avenues for the story to turn down. Grave Ransom definitely kept my interest with the action and storyline development but left me with little in the way of emotional feels. Overall, it is a good read that has a fabulous mystery that keeps you guessing until the final reveal.This review is based on a complimentary book I received from NetGalley. It is an honest and voluntary review. The complimentary receipt of it in no way affected my review or rating.Want to read and excerpt?

On one hand, it was great to see Alex and her magic back in the forefront of the story. The fourth left me a little wanting after such a long time away from Alex and company\u2019s adventures. I put a lot of hope on stake for this series on Grave Ransom. It delivered for the pieces I had hoped to see come back into the central part of the story, but one particular scene has left me a little lost. Since I received this book so early, I don\u2019t want to comment directly on the piece that I didn\u2019t like. Instead, I will let readers reserve judgement on their own. The only comment I do wish to make is that this particular part seemed like a cop out on something that has been building for four books. The abruptness of it has left me somewhat jaded and unsure what to think going forward. Does it mean this is the last Alex Craft book for me? No because I love this series and I want to see where it all ends just like any devoted reader. My only hope is that with the next book my questions will find absolution."}, {"userName": "LAB\u263a", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9346685-lab", "userReview": "This is a great series and even with the wait we had between books it is worth it.

I\u2019ve really enjoyed this series from the beginning. It was a little hard to get into this one. It has been a while since I read the previous book, so I didn\u2019t really remember what happened in that story. But it didn\u2019t take that long and I was deep into this book and I had all the information that I needed to enjoy this story.This one starts off with Alex out to a lunch with a friend when she feels the dead near back. It is strange when the \u201cdead\u201d that she is feeling is walking by her. She gets up to follow him. Come to find out, it is a dead body with a soul in it. She accidently pulls the soul out of the body, only to find out that the soul didn\u2019t belong with that body, but someone else entirely. Turns out that this isn\u2019t the only time it happens.This was a fun story with a lot of great investigative work as Alex and Briar try to solve this case. I really enjoyed the investigative part of this story. The romance part of the story really annoyed me. The complications between Alex and Death are starting to make me not enjoy their relationship. Death is just making things really hard on Alex. I\u2019m just over it.I know I didn\u2019t go into the investigative part of the story very much, but I really feel like you need to experience it for yourself. I don\u2019t want to give anything away. I really love Alex. I love this world that Kalayna Price has created. The secondary characters in this series are great. I love them all. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the romance, but that\u2019s okay. I do have a feeling that something will change with the next book (I\u2019m not give more details than that). I\u2019m excited for the next book. I hope I don\u2019t have to wait too long. NarrationI continue to love Emily Durante\u2019s narration of this series. I think the voices she chose for each character fits them well. There isn\u2019t a voice that stands out. Not a lot of accents or odd voices, but she just does a great job with the narration. A solid performance with great pacing and tones.**I like to thank the publisher for providing me with a copy of this audiobook in exchange for an honest review."}], "description": "Grave witch Alex Craft is no stranger to the dead talking.
