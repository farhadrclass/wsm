On the surface of Belinda Nicoll's book, Out of Sync, we find a South African woman struggling with immigrating to the US in the post-911 world. But this book is more than a \"fish out of water\" story. Nicoll layers her experience of living (and working) in a new country with the other \"out of sync\" areas of her life that seem to radiate out from the center-point of expatriation: out of sync marriage, professional life, spiritual life, and, ultimately, feeling out of sync with herself, as well.This book provided me with interesting examples of what non-Americans see when they come to the US to live and work, but more importantly, it allowed me to share in a struggle we all feel in different ways: the struggle to find some centered, balanced, and helpful approach to life. The answers Nicoll finds may not be my own, but there is much to learn by examining the journey."}, {"userName": "Sharon Lippincott", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7202737-sharon-lippincott", "userReview": "Two features of Belinda Nicoll\u2019s memoir, Out of Sync, first caught my eye: she immigrated from South Africa, a country I\u2019ve visited and remain curious about, and she and her husband landed at JFK International Airport on the morning of September 11, 2001. I immediately downloaded the book. Those two items were a small , but compelling part of the story. Fundamentally, this is a book about hope, growth, and transformation, but Nicoll\u2019s path to personal peace is contorted and full of tension and plot twists, so it held my attention.Her story begins in South Africa, where she was the unexpected youngest child in an Afrikaner family. She grew up playing with the black house servant\u2019s daughters and had mystical experiences involving a spirit she knew as the Serpent Goddess, who promised to tell her \u201cthe secrets of the universe.\u201d Unfortunately this promise was long delayed \u2014 the Serpent Goddess soon faded into the background for decades. At the tender age of 19, she became the trophy wife of an attorney and mother of two children. Eventually she began working, rising rapidly through the ranks in an advertising firm where she met her second husband, Bruce. The main story focuses on her gradual personal growth within the tumultuous framework of this second marriage. The tumult sprang partly from numerous factors out of her control, and partly from old baggage. Right after their hastily arranged wedding, she and Bruce flew to San Francisco where he had accepted a vice presidency with an international pharmaceutical advertising agency, promising that she\u2019d be able to easily resume her career. The adjustment was difficult for her. Bruce was sucked into the maelstrom of product introduction craziness, soon working twelve hour days, seven days a week, leaving her to find her way with only a visitor visa with impotent \u201cspouse\u201d classification not even sufficient for opening a bank account. I shared her despair while reading her account of Bruce\u2019s endless hours at the office livened by the gaiety of work-related social life while she sat home without the required credentials for finding a job or a meaningful way of passing time, and her constant frustrations adjusting to life in a strange city and strange country. The State Department compounded the problem with endless delays in issuing green cards. It was hard to imagine a good outcome for this story, especially as it also included her growing sense of guilt about essentially abandoning her young adult children and frustration as she discovered that her home country was becoming almost as strange to her as her new one. The redeeming factor was the availability of the rich cultural climate of the Bay Area.Geographical fixes were no solution. They both got jobs in a newly formed company in Saratoga Springs, but that was a disaster. From there they moved to Raleigh, which had a new set of challenges, and pressures within the marriage intensified before they moved to Ohio where they still reside. However, hope never dies, and she eventually came to grips with change, sharing a few of her secrets in the process. This is a gutsy story, one that must have been difficult to write. The intimacy of her personal revelations seems unflinchingly honest, and writing about those tough times meant reliving them. I suspect it also had a lot to do with healing them. I find hope in her courage, and I\u2019m deeply saddened by the obstructive role our State Department played in this situation and countless others like it.

When I read a synopsis of Belinda Nicoll's memoir, Out of Sync, and learned that she and her husband landed at JFK International Airport on 9/11, something pulled at my heartstrings and I knew I had to read her story.Belinda's story, however, deals with so much more than that one frightening incident in New York and the aftermath in the days that followed.Belinda had been on a roller coaster before arriving in America. Born in South Africa the youngest, and unexpected, child of an Afrikaner family, she grew up alongside the black house servant's daughters. Together, they used their imaginations to create a fantasy land which included the Serpent Goddess who made promises never realized. Blissfully unaware of their country's politics and coming upheaval, the girls became like sisters.Still very young, Belinda married an attorney in the law firm where she worked. Together they had two children -- a daughter and a son -- before their marriage crumbled. Belinda then climbed the ranks at an advertising agency where she met her second husband, Bruce.It is with Bruce that Belinda makes the move across the ocean to America. Not once did she even think that she would never be able to go back to her homeland, until things began a bumpy ride beginning with their landing at JFK on 9/11.Once in San Francisco Bruce landed a job with an ad agency but worked long hours tackling the learning curve. Belinda's solitary time at home because of her green card status left her feeling alone and abandoned at times. Delays by the U.S. Department of State in issuing green cards was more than difficult for Bruce and Belinda, and I find it an embarrassment that such inefficiencies and complacency exist.Removed from her children and other family members made life more difficult emotionally for Belinda, something it seemed hard for Bruce to cope with at times. This reader never doubted their love for one another; it seemed from time to time they were working at cross-purposes.After many job changes and moves from the west coast through the mid west and then upstate New York, they find themselves in Raleigh, NC. This part of Belinda's story resonated with me, especially her descriptions of the people, their colloquialisms, and their behavior toward outsiders and their believes. Growing up in the South made no difference when I moved from a large city to a small town within the same state. I was looked upon as \"suspicious\" because no one knew me and who knew why I'd come. I felt that Belinda and Bruce felt this same alienation when they arrived in Raleigh.Basically, this is a story of seeking common ground in the midst of a relationship cemented by love but fragmented by unrelenting circumstances created by outside forces. Belinda's tenacious desire to make their lives work in synchronicity shines through on each page turn. Bruce is not denied his part in attempting again and again to pull the pieces of their lives together and repair hurts and inadequacies.Belinda's ability to share the sheer truth of her story is amazing, not only because it is possible to sense that it is the truth that you're reading but also because the writer has honored character development, story line, and dialogue which is utterly believable and moving.Out of Sync is a story of healing and an excellent model of what memoir writing is."}, {"userName": "Madeline Sharples", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4103020-madeline-sharples", "userReview": "Out of Sync, a beautifully written book, was hard to put down.

Then once back, she finds her native land harder to live in than her new. She says, \u201cOnce more, Bruce and I felt like outsiders lagging behind, now homeless and jobless. Not only had we missed out on the American Dream but the South African one too.\u201d The kicker is that all of this emotional upheaval starts just as the newly wed couple arrives in New York City on September 11, 2001. The havoc caused by their being unable to leave on a connecting flight for several days sets the ominous tone of this book. As she put it, \u201cThere was little sense to be made of our situation. The more we tried putting our life back together again, the more fragmented it seemed to become. As I saw it, the real crisis we faced was our fast-changing world.\u201dAuthor, Belinda Nicoll cleverly inserts copies of her emails to friends and family back home. The words on these pages provide a bit of a comic relief in her story. \u201cWriting\u201d to her \u201cwas a soothing way to fill the empty mornings; it was my only way of self-expression; it was a sure way of retaining my presence, lest I slipped away from the minds of those I was hanging on to.\u201d She also puts everything in perspective when she talks to her alter egos Miss Worrywart and Miss Nuisance.Thankfully at the end she wrote, \u201cThese days, we\u2019re better able to maintain a good balance of together and alone times; I no longer take his need for solitude or collegial bonding as an affront to our marriage; we no longer use it as tool to indicate our displeasure with each other.\u201dShe had finally found her happiness. \u201c\u2026Now I\u2019m the expat who can\u2019t quite settle down, but in writing these words I realize I\u2019m really happy being who I am. And that\u2019s a comforting thought\u2014enough, even for me.\u201d A well-deserved beautiful ending to a fascinating story. Out of Sync is more than a memoir. It is an adventure story, a travelogue, a history of our changing times, and a philosophical view of the world and life. I applaud author Belinda Nicoll for writing it."}, {"userName": "Kathleen Pooler", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4812560-kathleen-pooler", "userReview": "Out of Sync is a perfect title for Belinda Nicoll\u2019s memoir of change, risk-taking, persistence, growth and ultimately, transformation. She takes us on a journey with her and her husband through many twists and turns between South Africa and the United States to satisfy their spirits of adventure while also seeking peace and balance in their lives. Since I have never been to South Africa, I was fascinated by her vivid descriptions of both her family life and her culture as well as political events surrounding her story.The story opens with her wedding to her second husband which is immediately followed by expatriation to the United States. Their arrival at JFK airport on September 11, 2001 pulled me into her story but it is her descriptive writing that kept me turning the pages. Her perceptions of the United States and our handling of the events are thought-provoking as well as disconcerting. I love how she reflects on childhood memories of growing up in South Africa, including her cherished relationship with the family\u2019s black servant\u2019s children Charlot and Evelyn and their imaginary play with the Serpent Goddess who acted as their Spirit Guide. This foreshadows her free spirit and belief in spiritual connections that become evident in her adult life and eventually lead her to her own place of peace.The main story involves the multiple moves the couple makes, including back and forth to South Africa and to different states within the United States in search of their dreams. Belinda paints a very realistic picture of their experiences in corporate America, her struggles within the marriage and with leaving her home country and children. I am from one of the areas she and her husband moved to and I found her descriptions of the local culture to be very accurate. She is able to discern the cultural and regional attitudes very well and convey her perceptions clearly in her writing.As a reader, I never felt \u201cout-of-sync\u201d with her story because she clearly describes her characters in a believable way, weaving in realistic dialogue and vivid sensory details. She brings me right into her scenes through a well-paced plot and graphic details of not only the people but the surroundings and takes me on a whirlwind tour of all her moves with honest reflections, humor and good pacing. The most important part is that she brings me full circle with her and her husband through the turmoil and conflict of all their moves to their transformations as individuals and as a couple. I felt satisfied and relieved that she and her husband found their place of peace and balance, clearly back in sync with one another and the world. This is a story of hope and standing up for what you believe. It is an extremely well-crafted and colorful memoir about being open to life\u2019s adventures and turning obstacles into new beginnings.

Without holding back, Belinda pulls us into the intricacies of married life, and shares what is was like to live in South Africa and being forced to choose an either-or identity for her children: English or Afrikaans. After her first marriage collapses, and her daughter leaves for Europe, Belinda follows Bruce--who proposes marriage\u2014and uproots to the U.S. Both of them have a desire for adventure, and adventure is what they get. From their arrival in New York on 9/11 2001, it seems that upheavals follow them for several years. Between numerous relocations and jobs in various cities in the U.S., they are not quite \u201cin sync.\u201d They both desire to work and at first Belinda tries to get a green card, but the reader finds out the difficulties of becoming a legal citizen in the U.S.During several relocations to various cities in the U.S., while returning to South Africa, Belinda questions where she truly feels \u201cat home.\u201d She describes in great detail, the feelings and resentments she goes through during her adaptation to life in the U.S. With complete honesty, we sense the financial stress and frustrations of not finding the \u201cideal\u201d job for both of them at the same time. Belinda shares so many of her emotions: the guilt of not being \u201cthere\u201d for her son and daughter in South Africa, and the jealousy she feels when Bruce works long hours and seems to thrive on his time at work, and cocktails after work. Belinda longs to find her dream job, which is life coaching, not working in the advertising business as she did in South Africa and attempted to start over when she and Bruce moved to Saratoga Springs. She\u2019s longing for balance in her life and the answer to her question: \u201cWhere is home?\u201d After several visits back \u201chome,\u201d Belinda finally realizes that the grass is not always greener, and in fact notices how people have changed, including her own children.

Interweaving Jungian psychology, new age \"guru\" spirituality, African politics, corporate realities, and a true love story, Belinda creates a memoir that is both educational and enlightening.The bulk \"Out of Sync\" unfolds in the years following September 11, 2001, as Belinda shows the United States from the view of a South African national trying to catch \"the American Dream\" ... just when it was beginning to erode for so many Americans themselves. Through funny stories and thoughtful descriptions, Belinda's writing \"gets out of the way\" and the reader is easily able to immerse oneself directly in the story.In spite of many setbacks and feeling \"out of sync,\" Belinda and her new husband are determined to try to make it work--for the sake of having food on the table and for the sake of their marriage commitment. Together they straddle the corporate \"go-go-go\" world and their new age spiritual studies.I connected with Belinda's story on so many levels. An expat myself, I could see just how her expectations had to shift dramatically when faced with the realities of her new home. The horror and confusion of 9/11 is, too, seared into my mind, psyche, and honestly, deep in my cells. Through Belinda's intelligent and insightful words, we see the world through her eyes--having to, wanting to, adapt as a stranger in a strange land. Willing to put in the hard work and do the due diligence, and yet, sometimes even with all of that, the outward trappings of success remain elusive.Belinda's life growing up in South Africa was one of the most enjoyable and engrossing aspects for me. Her childhood as a White Afrikaner (as distinct from a White British person), playing with two Black girls (not sure of their exact tribal ethnicity)--we see magical realism, her belief in spirits and goodness and fun. It's a story that's so specific to the politics and racial realities of the time, and reading about someone who lived it was absolutely fascinating.

Yet this is no agony tale, nor is it an exercise in catharsis and self discovery as memoirs often tend to be.From the incongruity of a happy multi cultural childhood f South Africa during the apartheid years, to carving a good career in a competitive industry, and going against the prevailing conventions by marrying \u2018the enemy\u2019, Belinda set her life up to be something of a roller coaster. The way she shares each adventure makes for fascinating reading, interspersed as the different phases are with snapshots of politics and world events that were affecting her environment at the time. Expatriated by her husband\u2019s chase up the career ladder, she found the American Dream is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. This might have been a disappointment that put off less determined folk than Belinda and her husband, but her perseverance and adaptability demonstrate resilience and adaptability that few can aspire to. From each plunge into disappointment, caused most often by her husband\u2019s career, she rises again, phoenix like, to take on new locations and new challenges, emerging at the end as a most able and proficient writer and life coach.There is fun and a pure delight in life throughout this memoir, along with things that will make you rail against petty injustice. She opens windows on the life limiting bureaucracy that reveals the \u2018\u2019Land of the Free\u2019 to be far more constrained than its protagonists would have you believe, whilst at the same time she comes to terms with the status quo and makes a very successful transition to become part of it.At odds with Saint Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s ideal of lovers looking together in the same direction, Belinda and her husband often found themselves being pulled in opposite directions. Throughout, however, bound by intense love and some interesting shared spiritual principles, they rode the roller coaster to create success in their lives whilst still retaining a strong sense of their origins.This is a memoir worth reading more than once."}, {"userName": "Ionia", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16434239-ionia", "userReview": "Although this book is centered on the events of September 11th and the way it changed the lives of people all over the world, this memoir is not all doom and gloom. The author is witty, and times just outright funny and most of all, honest. The descriptions she gives of her childhood in Africa set the tone for her continued journey to America, back to Africa and beyond. Belinda Nicoll has a talent for arranging her work in a way that is pleasing to the reader. You feel a range of emotions while reading this book, from happiness and laughter to immense sadness and tears. This is not a book to be taken lightly as \"just another memoir.\" At the heart of this story, is the memories of a woman who never quite fit in where she lived. In Africa, as a child, she was accepting of the other children she grew up with, but was also exposed to the hatred and incorrect thinking of adults who saw others as being beneath them. When she and her new husband came to America, the unthinkable happened and once again she was trying to exist amongst upheaval. Even returning to Africa, she finds that she no longer fits in. The emotional story that Belinda tells about her longing to be with her family, and having to adjust to living in a country where she is little more than a spouse, with no real identity of her own was incredible. This woman is a true survivor. I enjoyed the persistence of her spirit and her determination to succeed.I was very happy with the overall book, and I really enjoyed the ending. This memoir is interesting, human and well written. It makes you stop and think about where you are from and how secure you really feel about your own situation.

What I truly appreciate is the absolute candor with which the author divulges her story\u2014leaving us with an intimate glimpse into both the tender and complex dynamics of her marriage with Bruce. With her clean, unencumbered, yet often edgy use of language, Nicoll keeps us on the pulse of the couple's passion (for life, activity, meaning, and each other), while conveying the tensions underlying their marriage. In the midst of all their efforts, their struggles, their earnestness and their humanity, I found myself ultimately rooting for both of them as two totally real and likable characters.

I felt Nicoll\u2019s sense of rootlessness as she struggles to cope in a new environment without the support of family and old friends. I recognized my own life in her story of a talented and capable woman who loses her sense of self when she subordinates her needs\u2014personal as well as professional\u2014to those of her husband. I knew the angst she felt as she realized she was making some of the same life-choice mistakes in her new environment as she\u2019d made in the old.

We write about how terrible our lives are (even when they\u2019re not that bad), how toxic our relationships are (even though they\u2019re not really), and generally how awful the world, from our point of view, happens to be (OK, well, that one might be true).There\u2019s a fine line between writing a journal and writing a memoir: mainly (in my mind, anyway), memoirs tend to have a bit more of a theme than straight-out journaling. I guess . . . this book just doesn\u2019t fit the genre of memoir for me. I was expecting a unifying theme, but Nicoll veered from meditation to politics to advertising and back again. I think maybe it\u2019s this: you write a memoir because you\u2019ve done something remarkable or something remarkable has happened to you, whereas you write a journal to purge. And let\u2019s face it, unless you\u2019re Anais Nin, your purging probably isn\u2019t as exciting as you think it is.I\u2019d like to read Nicoll\u2019s upcoming novel; in keeping with my Nin references, there\u2019s a great deal of difference between one\u2019s personal writing and one\u2019s fiction . . . I haven\u2019t given up on Nicoll yet.Would I recommend it: Not this time, but I\u2019m withholding judment about her skills as a fiction writer.As reviewed by Melissa at Every Free Chance Book Reviews.(I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.)http://everyfreechance.com/2014/04/re..."}, {"userName": "Pat Mckinzie-lechault", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18833458-pat-mckinzie-lechault", "userReview": "Out of Sync is a must read for any expatriate and anyone feeling left out of the mainstream. As an American living in Europe, I identified immediately with the trials facing Belinda as she tries to jump-start her life with a new marriage, and relocation to the USA from her beloved South African homeland, arriving in New York on 9/11. The issues she confronts are those that any expat encounters, a sense of being rootless, a lack of identity, and difficulties obtaining residency and work permits.As a life coach, her introspective analysis of herself and her marriage allows the reader to reflect on interpersonal issues faced in their own lives.Belinda knows that change is inevitable and she has the courage to embrace it. New beginnings are always difficult, but ultimately they are life affirming, for it is only through acceptance of change that we become self-actualized.In a captivating writing style, Belinda expresses the personal, heartfelt anguish of a woman torn between continents, careers, and families. She offers intriguing cultural contrasts between America and South Africa, and she also provides an outsider's view into different parts of the USA as she recounts personal adversities encountered in her moves from San Francisco to upstate New York to Raleigh to the Midwest.I identified with this story on so many levels as an expat, as a mother torn between continents, as a partner relegated to a supporting role in a relationship, and as spiritual human being questioning choices made.I would love to sit down with Belinda for a long chat over a cup of coffee; reading Out of Sync is the next best thing to meeting her in person. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7606431-alison", "userReview": "Kindle memoir"}], "description": "In 2001, when a couple leaves South Africa for a stay abroad, they land at JFK International Airport on September 11th, unprepared for the sight of smoke billowing from the Manhattan skyline or the horror of a second plane exploding into the North Tower. Over the next ten years, as their host country confronts fundamental change of its own, their marriage buckles under the strain of their disparate experiences. With the international economic crisis making it all but impossible for them to return to their country, they relocate from California to the North, the South, and the Midwest searching for a place they can call home. Against the backdrop of uncertainties in post-apartheid South Africa, Belinda Nicoll unfolds a contemporary and thought-provoking account of post-9/11 America's tantalizing hopes and unexpected disappointments. Out of Sync is an insightful tale about marital endurance that promises to enthrall anyone, expatriate or not, who has ever felt at odds with themselves or the world.", "title": "Out of Sync", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15730892-out-of-sync", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1341151577l/15730892.jpg", "reviews": 19, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6433493.Belinda_Nicoll", "name": "Belinda Nicoll"}], "type": ["Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15730892-out-of-sync", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21250960-out-of-sync"]}
