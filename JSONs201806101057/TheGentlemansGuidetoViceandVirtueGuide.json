I am also maybe a tiny bit drunk.\nThis book is wonderful! Just so so much fun. It's light, it's silly, and I just couldn't stop giggling to myself from start to finish. It reminds me of My Lady Jane, but with lots of gay love and drunken shenanigans.Henry Montague, or \"Monty\" to those close to him, is about to set out on a Grand Tour of Europe with his sister and best friend, Percy. From Paris, through Marseilles, Barcelona, and Venice, to finally arrive on the beautiful island of Santorini. I'm jealous just thinking about it. He had initially planned a trip full of drink, love affairs, and merriment, but his father is trying to ruin his plans by sending Mr Lockwood to watch over him and put a stop to any scandalous behaviour. So, of course, Monty being Monty, the trip is full of drink, love affairs, and merriment. Only, he gets way more than he bargained for.Pirates and highwaymen make appearances on the journey, and they all seem out to ruin Monty's good time. And if that wasn't enough, Monty's not-so-platonic feelings for his good friend Percy just won't go away. \nThe great tragic love story of Percy and me is neither great nor truly a love story, and is tragic only for its single-sidedness. It is also not an epic monolith that has plagued me since boyhood, as might be expected. Rather, it is simply the tale of how two people can be important to each other their whole lives, and then, one morning, quite without meaning to, one of them wakes to find that importance has been magnified into a sudden and intense desire to put his tongue in the other\u2019s mouth.\nHumour is highly subjective, but I found it hilarious. There's just something so delightful about watching British high society men being buffoons. Monty's narration is immature and silly, often sarcastic, and yet he is so damn lovable. Of course, his ridiculous actions land the group in trouble again and again, but it is very entertaining to watch.I really enjoyed this historical romantic comedy. The whirlwind of European tourism served as an exciting backdrop for the rest of the action and romance. Monty and Percy have the perfect amount of sexual tension/love angst and I ship them so hard. And the ending made me smile so freaking much.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Regan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19645927-regan", "userReview": "4.25 So much fun!"}, {"userName": "Mackenzi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7727874-mackenzi", "userReview": "IDK sounds kinda dumb."}, {"userName": "Kat O'Keeffe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4672379-kat-o-keeffe", "userReview": "4.5 stars!

HOW??!?Never going to get over how honouring and respectful it is towards diversities. I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING. This is the book I needed when I was a smol teen. It is hilarious and queer and neurodiverse and full of absolutely astronomically funny moments.

It blew away all of my expectations. I went in expecting a cutesy YA m/m romance novel set in the 1700s, but it was so much more! This novel is full of action, adventure, feminism, a sassy narrator, high stakes, (AND a cutest m/m romance).I loved all the main characters - they are a terrific trio. Monty is particularly interesting to me because his addictions and recklessness make him potentially unlikable, but his sass, quick wit, and vulnerability make him impossible to love. Percy is such a mush - he is a precious lil bean who deserves the world for his kindheartedness. Also, kudos to the author for including epilepsy representation. I've grown up in a household with a parent who gets seizures and it's an immensely difficult thing to experience, but I'm especially pleased it was addressed within an 18th century context. Additionally, Felicity is a badass. I am  SO HERE FOR  women breaking societal norms and pursuing careers in fields like medicine. She is the Hermione of Monty and Percy and they would never have accomplished their feats without her. That being said, each character plays a crucial role in the strength of their relationship and they are all essential to the success of their endeavors. I'm not normally a historical fiction reader, but this novel is truly unique. The super comedic relief and the high-intensity action makes it entirely different from most historical YA novels I've read in the past. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone looking for a new novel with gay/bisexual characters, setting in 18th century Europe, intense action, and hysterical writing.

This book is adorable and this book is also the funniest thing I\u2019ve ever read, but it means the world to me, and I'm going to explain why. Okay, so first of all, THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY. I literally do Not remember the last time I enjoyed reading a book so much. Even my reading slump couldn't conquer this book. After I got off my slump-creating kindle and on to the hardcover copy I read at the bookstore, I read this in less than 24 hours. YES. \nThe great tragic love story of Percy and me is neither great nor truly a love story, and is tragic only for its single-sidedness. It is also not an epic monolith that has plagued me since boyhood, as might be expected. Rather, it is simply the tale of how two people can be important to each other their whole lives, and then, one morning, quite without meaning to, one of them wakes to find that importance has been magnified into a sudden and intense desire to put his tongue in the other\u2019s mouth.\nJust to be clear: I love pretty much everything about this book. It's fantastically paced, especially for such a long book - I mean, it broke my reading slump. It's hilarious - I laughed out loud multiple times. The romance is adorable and has some of the best development I've read in YA. Monty's character development was 10/10. The holy trinity at the center of the book is a ton of fun. Maybe I'll even talk more about this later and add something to this review. But you know what? You can find a thousand reviews about how cool everything in this book is. I want to talk about why this book was worth reading for me. There are two things - no, three things - about this book that I think are really special. First of all, Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue is hilarious, but not so light as to be flimsy. Not to shade every other book ever but this is 1) my niche category of favorite book and 2) a balance I think most books fail at; either we get books that are nothing but fluff, or books that are nothing but tragedy. This book is neither. It's dark, but it's also hopeful. When a book feels too light, it's escapist; when it feels too dark, it's depressing. This book made me feel like the universe doesn't suck too much. Just because people are survivors of abuse or trauma doesn't mean we always need to be in a world of angst.Secondly - I feel like such a pretentious asshole - I love the themes here about not needing to be cured to be an important person. You have no idea how rare it is for chronically ill / disabled / neuroatypical people to be treated as whole, to be treated as real. This book really explores the fact that Percy doesn't want to be cured; he just wants to be treated like a full person. I have never read a book that even mentioned this feeling. It was... perfect. God, I can't put every emotion I felt about this into a full sentence. Just... if you're looking for this theme, please pick this book up. Third, and maybe most important; this is historical fiction about people who don't get historical fiction. People love to declaim about how the historical fiction genre doesn't need diversity because, apparently, the only people who existed back then were white, straight, and abled. Which is serious bullshit. People like us have always existed; we just don't get books, especially historical fiction. Seeing representation like this in historical fiction is seriously new and it means the fucking WORLD to me. VERDICT: This is a cute historical romcom focusing on people who don't get historical fiction because the world used to hate us. It's adorable and hilarious and important and I had so much fun reading it.

Monty, my roguish booze-hound seductive charmer, oh, how I love thee!!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ORIGINAL REVIEWI think I ended this book with a migraine because I was grinning and laughing like an idiot the whole way through that it slowly took its toll on my brain. ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!WONDERFUL. Just wonderful! So delightfully heartwarming and hilarious. The Gentleman\u2019s Guide follows our main lead Monty who sets out on a grand tour around Europe with his best friend Percy and younger sister Felicity before taking over the family estate and... things basically go downhills from there.I cannot stress how hilarious this book is. Monty\u2019s narration on the situations they find themselves in, the banter and insults they throw at each other and the way the author weaves in a range of themes and topics like disability, women\u2019s place in society, abuse, race and sexuality with such intellect and compassion \u2013 while inserting humour and lightheartedness made this one of the most enjoyable reads of 2017 for me. \u2728 Monty: A hilarious (sensing a theme here?), fun-loving Bi-sexual British lord in love with his best friend, Percy. He is an absolute delight who, not only happens to be utterly and completely useless in times of crisis, more often than not, he IS the cause of most of their troubles.\u2728 Percy:  A ray of sunshine and the most patient, sweet and loving guy who constantly has to deal with the backlash of his racial status. \u2728 Felicity is simply a clever gem. She is sassy, brilliant and a resourceful girl whose role is more like the protector of the group rather than 'Monty\u2019s tag-along younger sister.'There\u2019s so much depth and layers to these characters. Percy, having to deal with racial discrimination, Felicity not being able to do what she really wants, as opposed to what society dictates she must do, Monty-though clueless at the start and somewhat shallow, slowly having to confront his privileges over these two people that he loves in terms of their social standing as well as having to confront his own issues and realising certain things about himself and his growth over the course of the book was all beautifully written.And the romance! \ud83d\ude0d Guys, if nothing else, the heavy dose of romance alone, that\u2019s simply heartwarming and gush-worthy should more than suffice to encourage you to give this a try.Monty\u2019s inner monologue about Percy... ahhhh holy crap, it was like sparks were flying through the pages!\ud83d\udc95Seriously \u2013 Go get your hearts all warm and fuzzy. \u2764\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "destiny \u2620 howling libraries", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15335689-destiny-howling-libraries", "userReview": "\u201cWe are not broken things, neither of us. We are cracked pottery mended with laquer and flakes of gold, whole as we are, complete unto each other. Complete and worthy and so very loved.\u201dWhat I knew before reading this book: 1) it was hist-fic, and 2) it was cute as hell. What I knew after reading this book: it is nonstop shenanigans and I adored every single damn page.This is my first time reading Mackenzi Lee's writing, and I really enjoyed it. With Monty as the narrator, it felt every bit the part of being stuck inside the head of a wild, reckless teen boy in the 18th century. When he ached, I ached for him; when he laughed, I smiled.\u2718 PLOTHenry \"Monty\" Montague is expected to be refined, intelligent, brave, and \"manly\" - not this gambling, alcoholic, wild playboy whose days are filled less with helping run his father's estates and more with chasing skirts (and trousers). In a last-ditch effort to reform him, Lord Montague sends Monty on a Tour: a year-long trip to see the world, take in a bit of culture, and curb his wicked ways. Unfortunately for Lord Montague, he's allowed the inclusion of Percy - Monty's very best friend, whom he is helplessly in love with.\u2718 CHARACTERSSpeaking of characters, Gentleman's Guide is full to the brim with lovable folks:\u2022\tThere\u2019s Monty, our narrator. He\u2019s arrogant, self-centered, and rude, which feels like the bulk of his personality traits in the beginning of the story; however, it\u2019s soon shown that he has been through tremendous hardships that have formed the behaviors he displays. There\u2019s such character growth and development present in his story, and by the end, I was amazed at how far he had come.\u2022\tPercy, Monty\u2019s best friend and our resident love interest. He\u2019s so precious, kindhearted, and loving, and my heart broke for him every time anyone had a cruel word to say about his dark skin and biracial blood.\u2022\tFelicity Montague: Monty\u2019s little sister, who joins them on their Tour. She begins the story as a bit of a brat, but we quickly learn that it\u2019s her defense against being expected to perform as a \u201clady\u201d when all she really wants to do is practice medicine. She is full of clever quips and remarks - see for yourself:\u201cJust thinking about all that blood.\" I nearly shudder. \"Doesn't it make you a bit squeamish?\"\"Ladies haven't the luxury of being squeamish about blood,\" she replies, and Percy and I go fantastically red in unison.\u2022\tThere\u2019s also a motley crew of side characters in varying degrees of wonderfulness (and awfulness), but I\u2019ll just take a moment to mention my favorite: Scipio, the pirate captain. Scipio is such a sweet character, and I wish we could have had even more time to spend with him throughout the story, because I feel like he had so much more to teach Monty.\u2718 WHAT I LIKEDThis story is just fun. It has its heartbreaking moments - quite a few of them, in fact - but at its core, it's an adventure story, a love story, a story of growth and self-acceptance, and so much more.Mackenzi has a way of making social remarks in such a down-to-earth, understandable way. There are a handful of discussions on homosexuality/bisexuality, as well as gender roles - such as Felicity's desire to practice medicine, meanwhile Monty has no desires to be lord of his father's estates. Monty also describes himself as being small in stature more than once, pointing out how much the insults to his height and form have damaged his self-view.More than anything, I loved the discussions regarding racism in the 18th century - especially because the discussions usually felt so relevant to modern times, too. We see Percy treated poorly time and time again for his dark skin, and it's always addressed, but my favorite exchange was actually during a scene in which Monty uses his white, English appearance to get Scipio and the rest of the crew out of trouble. I won't spoil anything, but at the end of the exchange, Monty essentially asks for an apology/thank-you, and Scipio wrecks the White Savior Complex before it can even begin:\u201cThere is nothing good about watching another man claim your ship because your skin is too dark to do it yourself,\" he says, each word a glancing wound. \"So in future, you needn't demand apologies on my behalf.\u201dI had been increasingly worried that Monty's status as the only white guy around was going to become problematic, but nope - more than once, he was humbled and brought to the realization that his efforts didn't always come from as healthy of a place as he thought they did.The final thing I want to bring attention to is Percy's epilepsy, and how Mackenzi Lee handled it; she showed how backwards the general views on misunderstood ailments were at the time (such as people believing epilepsy was caused by demonic possession or mental illness), but there are also some really great tidbits here and there about living with a lifelong illness. I won't spoil anything for you, but Percy's stance on his condition towards the end of the book was so authentic and heartwarming.\u2718 WHAT I DISLIKEDI literally only had one complaint about the entire book, and it's not really a complaint as much as it is a note to the editor: in several instances, pieces of dialogue are placed in closed quotations, with no indication to who is speaking. Maybe part of it is due to the fact that I read a lot of this book late at night while being very tired, but I kept having to go back and reread paragraphs to try and make sense of who said what.\u2718 FINAL VERDICTThis book is beyond wonderful, and I think that everyone needs to read it. It's a delightful adventure story written around an adorable romance and it's just fun. If you pick this one up, you're in for a hell of a good ride.\u2718 CONTENT WARNINGSHomophobia, ableism, racism, alcoholism, PTSD, severe parental abuse.

And second, how handsome is this sofa?\u201d \nHey look, historical fiction that isn\u2019t all pain, bloodshed and boring people! (Also not just old white men!)Taking place in the early 1700s, Mackenzi Lee's latest focuses on Henry Montague (or Monty) and his parent's last ditch attempt to 'tame' him. Monty sets off on his coming-of-age tour of Europe with his sister (Felicity) and his best friend (Percy). They get detoured by highwaymen and end up in a scheme involving Alchemists and the French Aristocracy in a plot that rivals any adventure flick. But also a lot of introspection, as Monty struggles with finding his place and dealing with his massive crush on Percy.  Pros: This is just so much fun. The story is bizarre and different, and takes you to several different lands as everything slowly starts to come together. It\u2019s all a bit of roller-coaster ride, but really engrossing and hard to put down. It\u2019s simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking? Like in one scene we have Monty calling a horse a leggy sausage then the next we have someone discussing the ramifications of chronic illness. Both the serious and silly topics are handled well.Especially the discussion of sexuality. Like damn. At one point Felicity and Monty sit down and discuss his penchant for attractive men and the whole discussion blew me away. It fits perfectly into the historical context, so they both really lack language we have now\u2014like orientation and sexuality. But despite matching their characters and the time-period, everything they discuss feels so relevant. This is so tropey but does it so well. I will never tire of the mutual-pining and oh-no-we-have-to-share-a-bed tropes and I won\u2019t even apologize for it. I want to be Felicity when I grow up. She\u2019s seriously such a strong character and I love her. We discover half-way through the book that she\u2019s interested in medicine, though it\u2019s not \u2018appropriate\u2019 for women at the time. She has a really sharp wit about her and her functioning as the group\u2019s quasi-doctor was an incredibly fun touch. \u201dLadies haven\u2019t the luxury of being squeamish about blood.\u201dOther wonderful things this book contains\u2022\tBisexual representation\u2022\tA man running naked through Versailles \u2022\tProminent gay POC\u2022\tA baby referred to as \u201cThe Goblin\u201d\u2022\tEpilepsy representation\u2022\tPrivateers turned pirates\u2022\tA minor-fantasy-sci-fi-sorta element Al of these elements are told through a very strong narrative. Not only does the writing reflect the voice very well, but it accurately sets the historical tone without coming across dry or boring.  Cons Coming in at 525+ pages, I couldn\u2019t help but feel this was just too long. As much as I enjoyed the wacky adventures and how it all unfolds, this takes a good 20% to get going, and then the real plot only kicks in around 40%. Overall, the writing is excellent but there were several paragraphs and sentences that could have been more concise, especially towards the end. There also was a pattern of repeating words that just felt really clunky. Examples:\n \u201cNo one but me had had to see her to realize\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re breathing so hard it seems a miracle that that alone doesn\u2019t give us away.\u201d \nI think I expected a little more for Monty's character development? It's certainly there-- in bits and pieces that rush together at the end. As much as we are told he's changed, I don't feel we were properly shown. Though he has lovable traits, he still seems incredible selfish, and I'm not certain why they put up with him at times. In Conclusion Really fun, LGBT-themed, historical adventure. Though not without some pacing and structure issues."}, {"userName": "Warda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30036082-warda", "userReview": "[EDIT: Despite the flaws this book had, when a book - or the characters in this case - pop into your head quite frequently, a book deserves 5 stars.]--------------------------THIS BOOK! THESE CHARACTERS! IT WAS SO DELICIOUSLY GAY, PEOPLE! *heart eyes**chants* MERCY! MERCY! I promised myself that I'd review this properly, but what the hell, fuck it. My heart is a wreck and so full of love! So full of Monty and Percy! I need more of them two SO DAMN BADLY!!!!!! Their story can't be over! *SOBS*The main reason I am not giving it a 5 stars, is just that the plot wasn't as gripping as I wanted it to be, personally. There was progression, but it wasn't mind blowing. I just didn't care for what they stole, the power it had, them being chased due to the robbery and neither did I care for how it wrapped up. The characters and their development is what kept me reading and the story going.I WAS JUST FEELING MEH ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WANTED MORE MONTY AND PERCY INTERACTION AND CONVERSATIONS AND JUST MORE AND MORE OF THEM TWO!Gosh, I don't even know what the fuck I am saying anymore. But read this book for the LGBTQ characters, for the underlying, important themes floating throughout the story, such as the damaging consequences abuse can have on the victim's psyche, racism, the issues surrounding sexuality and misogyny.

XD)Well anyway, what I\u2019m actually trying to tell you is that I loved this book!!!I adored the characters and I really liked the fact that it turned out to be some huge adventure! When I read \u201cThe Gentleman\u2019s Guide\u201d I was never bored and considering the fact that we\u2019re talking about a book with more than 500 pages this definitely speaks volumes about how much I enjoyed it! It was such a rollercoaster of emotions and sometimes my feelings actually had a more than just hard time to adjust. One moment I\u2019d be all like \u201cAwww this is so damn cute\u201d and the next moment I\u2019d be close to crying because the characters background stories affected me so much! I guess it\u2019s safe to say that this book gave me all the feels and if you\u2019re looking for a funny book that also has its serious moments \u201cThe Gentleman\u2019s Guide of Vice and Virtue\u201d definitely should be your first choice! ;-)This said I\u2019m finally ready to continue with the actual review! So here I go:The plot:Monty and Percy have known each other for years and aren\u2019t just best friends but also want to make their \u201cGrand Tour\u201d in Europe. Everything is already planned and their destinations are merely waiting for them. So far so good, right? Nope! First of all Monty has a long time crush on Percy, secondly Felicity, Monty\u2019s little sister is going to join them and thirdly they have a bear-leader who can\u2019t take a joke! Considering it all their \u201cGrand Tour\u201d actually sound like it\u2019s going to be a boring disaster and it is! Well, at least until Monty gets seduced by a mysterious woman and steals an important object from her chamber in Versailles. After that their carefully planned tour goes straight to hell and an adventurous chase through the metropolises of Europe begins! ;-)The characters:\nAlso known as my spoiler section! So beware, if you really don\u2019t want to be spoiled, you better retreat now! ;-P\nMonty:\u201dNo visitations to any dens of iniquity,\u201d he goes on, \u201cor sordid establishments of any kind. No caterwauling, no inappropriate relations with the opposite sex. No fornication. No slothfulness, or excessive sleeping late.\u201dIt\u2019s beginning to feel like he\u2019s shuffling his way through the seven deadly sins, in ascending order of my favourites.Henry Montague broke my freaking heart!!! This boy was so broken and damaged that it almost physically hurt to read about his past! I swear whenever I found out another bit of it, I had an overwhelming urge to hug and cradle him and the more I got to know him, the more I felt a sudden need to strangle his damned father! At the beginning of the book you only see Monty\u2019s mask, the spoiled and irresponsible son of an English Gentleman, who\u2019s drinking, partying and fornicating whenever he feels like it! BUT the longer you read, the more you realise that Monty\u2019s behaviour is nothing but a way to deal with his past! To say the relationship with his father is rocky certainly would have been the understatement and I swear when I read that he beat the shit out of his son I was so angry that I gripped my book! \u201dIf he could beat this out of me, I would have let him long ago.\u201dTo read this sentence was so damn painful! Because it doesn\u2019t just describe how Monty feels but also what he thinks about himself! His father made him feel like he\u2019s a worthless piece of sh** just because he\u2019s bisexual and this is soo wrong on so many different levels that I can\u2019t help but have to despise him for it! \u201dFelicity reaches out like she\u2019s going to touch my face, but all I can feel is Helena slapping me and the thief-taker raising his hand just to see me flinch and then it\u2019s my father, and all the while me with no power to fight back or protect myself against any of them.And I begin to cry.\u201dTo see how Monty struggled caused my heart to ache and whenever he flinched away from someone, no matter if it was Helena\u2019s father, the thief-taker or Scipio, I felt such an overwhelming sympathy that I just wanted him to be happy!!! But oh, how Mackenzi Lee tortured me!!! She hurt my precious boy and then she hurt him even more and when I thought I couldn\u2019t take it anymore she put the final nail in my coffin!!! MACKENZI LEE why did you have to hurt Monty so much??? He deserved happiness but all he got was even more pain!! T_T Well at least until the end\u2026 XD\u201dI\u2019ll not torment myself with a half-naked Percy any more than is absolutely necessary. Entirely clothed Percy is almost more than I can bear.\u201dWell, anyway! I loved how much Monty crushed on Percy and to read his thoughts was so funny, heart-breaking, adorable, delightful and I don\u2019t even know what else! *lol*Just amazing!! XDPercy:\u201dPercy\u2019s ill.It\u2019s seeping through me like a poison, leaving me jumbled up and numb. Percy\u2019s ill and will never be well again and is being sent away to die in a sanatorium because of it. And, close on its heels, a second thought that leaves me nearly as cold \u2013 Percy didn\u2019t trust me enough to tell me so.\u201dPoor sweet and caring Percy! When I found out that he has epilepsy I was at least as devastated as Monty and the mere idea of him spending the rest of his life in an asylum was more than just revolting!!! I can\u2019t believe people actually did things like that but I know Mackenzi Lee had a realistic approach and oriented herself on the reality of that time. Still, it was horrible that such things happened and I\u2019m really glad that medical science improved over those last few centuries! =) Unfortunately Percy\u2019s illness isn\u2019t the only thing he has to deal with, the actuality he\u2019s of African heritage causing more than its fine share of troubles as well! I cringed whenever someone made a racist remark and there were moments when I just wanted to knock the stuffing out of those ignorant and stupid people! What made it even worse was that Percy was so used to being treated like that and didn\u2019t even think about putting up a fight. Monty and Felicity did though and I only loved them even more for it! XD Felicity:\u201dIt\u2019s true \u2013 Felicity is not a broken horse. A finishing school will kick the spirit straight out of her, and while I\u2019ve never been particularly fond of my sister, the thought of a quiet, simpering, cross-stitching, tea-sipping Felicity feels like a slash through a painting.\u201dOhhh Felictiy was such an awesome character!!! I loved that self-confident and sassy girl! Plus she loved to read and tackled her problems head-on! If Monty and Percy wouldn\u2019t have had Felicity they probably would have even died on their very first day! *lol* She definitely had guts and apparently she was even a better thief than the two boys. XD I heard that there\u2019s going to be second book that\u2019s written from Felicity\u2019s POV and I\u2019m already looking forward to read it! \u201dLadies haven\u2019t the luxury of being squeamish about blood,\u201d she replies, and Percy and I go fantastically red in unison.The relationships:Monty & Felicty:\u201dI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says.\u201cWhat for?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve had a rough go.\u201d\u201cEveryone has a rough go. I\u2019ve had it far easier than most people.\u201d\u201cMaybe. But that doesn\u2019t mean your feelings matter less.\u201dI absolutely loved and adored their conversations!!! They were so sweet and honest and they actually sounded like real siblings! I have an older sister and I swear I really found myself and her in Monty\u2019s and Felicity\u2019s relationship! XD The teasing and the seriousness when it comes to certain topics and the attempt to understand each other!! The fact that they cared even though they didn\u2019t want the other to know and always tried to keep it on a light note! I swear I never ever read such a realistic approach and I think Makenzi Lee did an amazing job at picturing the relationship between siblings! ;-)\u201dWhat are you doing? Oh no, are you trying to get along with me? Do we have to get along now?\u201d\u201cWhat? No. Of course not.\u201d\u201cThank God.\u201d\u201cGet along. Don\u2019t be absurd.\u201dPercy & Monty:\u201dIt is impossible to explain how you can love someone so much that it\u2019s difficult to be around him. And with Percy sitting there, half in shadow, his hair loose and his long legs and those eyes I could have lived and died in, it feels like there\u2019s a space inside me that is so bright it burns.\u201dWhat can I say about those two? I loved the way Monty thought about Percy and I loved how they treated each other. They were so gentle and careful and even though they both wanted the same thing they had so many misunderstandings that it was more than just infuriating to watch. It was pure torture to read about them when they quarrelled, but oh god how much I loved it when they were close to each other. There was so much tension in the air, so much anticipation\u2026. I just wanted them to kiss and end up in bed! *lol* \u201dHe reaches out, almost as though he can\u2019t help himself, and puts his thumb on my jawline. The tips of his fingers brush the hollow of my throat, and I feel the touch so deep I half expect that when he moves, I\u2019ll be left with an imprint there, as though I am a thing fashioned from clay in a potter\u2019s hands.\u201d\u201dIt\u2019s like being set aflame. More than that \u2013 it\u2019s like stars exploding, heavens on fire. Kissing Percy is an incendiary thing.\u201dFinal conclusion:\u201cThe Gentleman\u2019s Guide to Vice and Virtue\u201d was a wonderful journey and kept me thoroughly entertained. It was heart-breaking, adorable and hilarious and if there\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t like, then it\u2019s the simple fact that the book unfortunately had to end! *lol* \u201dWe are not broken things, neither of us. We are cracked pottery mended with lacquer and flakes of gold, whole as we are, complete unto each other. Complete and worthy and so very loved.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Shreya (\u2606High Lady of The Night Court\u2606)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62560505-shreya-high-lady-of-the-night-court", "userReview": "MYHEARTMYHEARTMYHEARTMYHEARTI absolutely LOVED this book and everything it stand for. I love the way the author created these characters and articulated their thoughts in such a marvelous way. I was in love with Felicity, Monty, and Percy before the second chapter even ended and only grew to like them more as the story progressed. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting from this book but it definitely was not this. I knew I was going to love this book the second I started it and it met all my expectations, which were pretty high to begin with considering the amazing things I\u2019ve heard about it. I read the blurb for this book on Goodreads and started reading it with a perspective that it was going to be this easy to get through, funny read and I did get that feel from it, but it was also so much more. This book is tagged Historical Fiction, Romance, and LGBT, even though they are accurate, they make the book seem kind of superficial but there is actually a lot of emotional depth to this book if you look for it.Our main characters, Monty, Percy, and Felicity make the most heartwarming trio possible. Henry Montague is an Earl\u2019s son, yet he is the opposite of what you would consider to be a \u2018lord\u2019. He spends him time drinking, chasing after both women and men, and just about anything else that will tarnish his father\u2019s reputation. Monty is so deeply in love with his best friend, Percy, to the point where it hurts to be around him as he is unable to tell him he\u2019s in love with him. Through this book we get to see their relationship progress and it is so adorable because neither of them are sure if the other likes them and they are 2 very emotionally volatile people. Putting the nature of their relationship aside, their friendship and the fact that they stand by the other\u2019s side no matter what, really hits you in the gut. It clearly reflects the value of friendship and how much it means to every single one of us to always have a friend to laugh with, to have fun with, to lean on, to confide in, to go so crazy with to the point where anyone else would put the both of you in a mental hospital, no matter what comes your way.The book deals with a lot of issues in the 18th century society such as racism and sexism. In the racism point of view, the author clearly shows how blacks were abused and dishonored and how they were never treated above the position of a servant. The sexism aspect we see clearly with Felicity as we see over and over again that women were not given the opportunities men were and that they considered to be inferior to the man. In such a situation, seeing Felicity\u2019s dreams and how she will always defend and argue in favor of the position of women in society, is inspiring. Felicity is without a doubt my favorite character. Felicity goes against the picture of what an ideal \u2018lady\u2019 would be in that time period. She\u2019s a total bad ass. She is capable beyond measure and can take care of herself. She stands against how women are treated and embodies a true feminist. She is a bookworm, which only gave me reason to love her more. I mean come on, when we were first introduced to her, she was eating breakfast with a book standing up with the support of a jam pot with a fork wedged in it to keep it standing. How can we not love this girl?!It\u2019s a funny, clever, charming, delightful story and I loved it. I must say, I don\u2019t really read much Historical Fiction but this book was amazing. All the hype surrounding this book was justified and if you are a person who enjoys reading Historical Fiction or a fun contemporary book I definitely recommend it to you."}, {"userName": "Catriona (LittleBookOwl)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5365999-catriona-littlebookowl", "userReview": "Rating: 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77602709-maria", "userReview": "4.6/5 Stars \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f\u201cWe are not broken things, neither of us.

I thought it would be a light-hearted, fluffy, cute, funny and romantic gay love story set in the 18th century England but it was so much more than that. It was deep, it was heart wrenching, it was profound, it was adventurous, it was emotional, it was so many things I never thought it would be. It contained strong, weak, flawed, clever and real characters who made mistakes who came back from them and corrected them. In addition, it touched difficult topics such as homophobia, sexism, racism, house violence which were exceptionally prominent at the time.I read this book in 3 sittings which doesn't happen too often for me. The pace of this book was so quick, there was always something happening to keep me on my toes, I couldn't leave it down. I like books with quick pace that don't let me get bored by them and leave them down for another time. This was one of them. The author also succeeded in making the protagonist feel real. Monty, a rich privileged rake, a fuck-everyone-and-everything-that-walks-on-this-earth bugger, a weak selfish and dramatic bitch who makes the worst and also the best decisions at the same time. Monty, a man in love with his best friend, Percy, a not so little wounded puppy that needs love, Monty a man who will shake up the earth to save his beloved Percy. I loved and hated at times this character with my whole being. I wanted to protect him and also slap him in the face for making bad decisions and saying the wrong shit all the time. I love characters like that. Raw characters who think vile thoughts and do selfish things like we humans do. Thank you, author, for this character.We also got Felicity. My personal role model, a warrior of her time, a clever bitch who will fuck you up with a single stare. I abso-fucking-lutely adored her. She is a girl too smart, too mature and too independent for her time and age who is trying to overthrow stereotypes surrounding women of the time and become a doctor. I'm so glad the next book will be about her, I can't wait to read her adventures.I also appreciated, as a Greek girl, the Santorini mentions at the end and I'm so glad they're gonna stay there! It makes me really happy when they make Greek mentions in books, television and movies, it makes my Greek heart die a little. Last but certainly not least, the ship I shipped in this book since the first sentence, Monty and Percy. MY LITTLE SHIPPER HEART IS DYING BECAUSE OF THEM. I wanted to kill them both for making such ill-fated decisions and stepping away from each other! LIKE YOU'RE BOTH IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER JUST SAY IT OR I WILL SAY IT FOR YOU!!! This ship was a mad train from the beginning to the end and I was so glad we got to experience their relationship. Ok, if I continue with this review I will literally pass the 16912 characters left as of now, so I will leave it here. This book was spectacular and I will definitely order the next one in the series!

Mackenzi Lee's \nThe Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue\n is one of those books. What a sensational story, with characters I won't soon forget!In 18th century England, Henry \"Monty\" Montague has grown up a son of privilege. His father is a lord with a sizable estate and business concerns, all of which he expects Monty to take over sometime soon. The thing is, Monty is more than a bit of a rake\u2014a lovable one at times, but a rake nonetheless\u2014one who is far too fond of carousing, drinking, causing trouble, and finding himself in romantic situations with a large number of young men...and women. All of this and he's not quite 18 yet!Monty and his best friend, Percy (with whom Monty is more than a little besotted) are scheduled to have one last hurrah\u2014a Grand Tour of Europe, where they will see the sites and have their last gasps of fun, after which Monty will begin working alongside his father and becoming a responsible adult, while Percy will leave for law school in Holland. But Monty's father has tired of his son's escapades and sharply curtails what his son has planned, sending along a teacher/chaperone of sorts who will monitor all of their activities. And then his father makes the ultimate threat\u2014embarrass the family one more time, or get caught with another young man, and Monty will be disinherited.\"I'm too useless to make a life on my own, no matter how odious the one selected for me is. I'm well shackled to my father, no way to escape or want things for myself.\"While at first his father's restrictions put a damper on the Grand Tour, it's not long before Monty and Percy begin to sneak away and enjoy themselves, under the watchful and jealous eye of Monty's younger sister, Felicity, who is supposed to be dropped off at finishing school along the way, despite her desire to pursue an educational and career path open only to men in those days.\"It occurs to me then that perhaps getting my little sister drunk and explaining why I screw boys is not the most responsible move on my part.\"The more time Monty and Percy spend together, the more he wants to divulge his feelings for his best friend, despite his father's warnings. Yet one of the many things Monty is clumsy at is expressing his feelings, and more often than not, he winds up pushing Percy away, which is precisely what he doesn't want. One night, in a pique of jealousy and mischief, Monty makes a rash decision that puts the trio in danger, and sends them fleeing through France into Spain and Italy, throwing them into untenable situation after untenable situation, and forcing them to do\u2014and say\u2014things they never thought they would.Along the way they will reveal and uncover secrets about one another which may forever change their relationships and their futures, and Monty, in particular, will finally begin to understand what life is like for those not born into privilege. But will these discoveries be enough to free them from danger and change the course of their lives?\nThe Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue\n is both a rollicking adventure and an emotional book about finding what makes you happy (or whom), and accepting who you are and where your life should lead. It's also a book about coming to terms with the world around you and finally acting like an adult when you've been coddled and indulged for far too long to really understand the challenges other people face. Despite the setting and the characters' backgrounds, this is book with universal themes, and one that is just so wonderfully told that it made me laugh, smile, and, of course, get a little teary-eyed more than a few times, too.I seriously loved this book. The characters Lee has created, from Monty, Percy, and Felicity to those they encounter along the way, are all fascinating in different ways. Monty does get annoying from time to time, and you wish he'd just do and say what he needs to, but I just couldn't get enough of him. I would love to see this as a movie, because I think these characters and their story would be as fascinating to watch unfold as it was to read. I can't wait to see what Lee comes up with next.I really don't have any more words to express how I felt about this book. Maybe Meryl Streep can help."}, {"userName": "amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61624004-amy", "userReview": "there's nothing like your most anticipated read of the year actually coming up to your expectationsThis book singlehandedly saved 2017 pass it on\n\u201cThe stars dust gold leafing on his skin.

Except that it's so much more than just that. Percy and Monty decide to go on a Tour through Europe, save that there are \"far more thrilling heroics than advertised\" and, you know, shit goes south. (spoiler: they meet pirates. yes, you heard me right. Pirates!!! even tho they are the \"worst pirates in the history of the Mediterranean\", pirates are pirates and pirates are great say it with me!!!)Characters:\u2022 Henry \"Monty\" Montague, a bisexual legendfuck i know he's a bastard at times, but he's a hilarious one at that. I literally laughed out loud in the middle of a train when he referred to his horse as \"more of a leggy sausage\", Monty Why Are You Like This Montyanyways, his narration was 11/10 on point praise jesus hallelujah and so was his character development. ((dam, that character development tho))also, he's very relatable at times, and you can't argue with that\n\"I'm short on a plan but have an abundance of panic.\"\nme. in every situation every day all day forever until the end of timeMonty is just literally That Character that's a little problematic at times, but at the same time you just want to hold him very tight and tell him everything is going to be alright.\u2022 Percy Newton, aka my brand-new actual son(is he a human or a puppy??? scientists are clueless)I don't even know how to form words that describe Percy Newton in its entirety because he is..... he is.......... a Dante Quintana. A Soft Boi!!! One of those precious gems!!He also has epilepsy and absolutely everything in this book is handled perfectly, including his sickness.\n\"Yes, I'm ill. I'm an epileptic - that's my lot. It isn't easy and it isn't very enjoyable but it is what I've got to live with. This is who I am, and I don't think I'm insane. I don't think I should be locked up and I don't think I need to be cured of it for my life to be good.\"\nI legit want to adopt him so I can finally give him the love and attention he deserves and give him a home that makes him feel warm and safe and happy...... someone hand me the adoption papers, right now\u2022 Felicity Montagueyes???????? yes????????????????? so much yesGetting The Lady's Guide to Petticoats and Piracy feels like the Ultimate Blessing and I can't thank the universe and especially Mackenzi Lee enough for giving me a reason to live until 2018 so she can save my sorry ass once againanyways i've been waiting for this \"men are such babies\" slytherclaw-ass lady all my life and i'm so glad she's the glue holding this glorious trio togetheralso, her relationship with Monty is 900% me and my brother (except we don't have as many issues) and I'm not gonna lie, all their sibling moments warmed my black hole inside my chest a little\n\"'What are you doing? Oh no, are you trying to get along with me? Do we have to get along now?''What? No. Of course not.''Thank God''Get along. Don't be absurd.'\"\n\u2022 #Mercy(That's their official ship name, get over it)The Romance was possibly my favorite aspect of this book, purely because it was so well executed. I don't even know what else to say besides that it WILL 100% MEET ALL YOUR EXPECTATIONS and if not i'll give you a refund i promise everything about Monty x Percy felt natural and beautiful and soft and i'm sure that pairing will steal all your hearts \n\"There's not a thing on God's green earth that has the power to disarm me quite like two inches of Percy's skin.\"\nFetch me a couch, for I nearly swoon.

Silliness and cluelessness. He eventually does gain *some* maturity, but never enough to deserve a newfound respect and admiration from me.The key to loving this book is loving its humour. If that element works for you, and you don\u2019t mind that Henry would rather drink all day and frolic all night, you\u2019re the right reader for this story.I did not love the romance either. It never made me swoon, let alone sweep me off my feet. It\u2019s just\u2026 there. I kept thinking, Percy deserves someone who doesn\u2019t play games and will treat him like he is the world\u2019s 8th wonder. Not someone who lies and pretends.Everything about Henry screams privilege. Percy is darker-skinned, therefore he cannot allow himself to behave erratically, but he also isn\u2019t the type to do so. He is more laid-back, quiet and he thinks before he speaks/behaves. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that this is not an entertaining book. It is fast-moving, because the action comes from everywhere. No one is lethargic and everyone contributes *almost* equally to the events. Felicity and Percy are wonderful. But when you don\u2019t like/can\u2019t connect to the hero, whose voice is the first you hear and whose humour makes you cringe, it\u2019s hard to close a book with hearts in your eyes. It\u2019s hard to even let yourself enjoy the other elements. This was never for me.
