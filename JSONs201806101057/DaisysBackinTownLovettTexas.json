I personally hated DAISY'S BACK IN TOWN with a passion and would give it less than one star if it were possible. It was poorly written, the characters were not very well developed and the secondary characters grated on my nerves. There were too many holes in the story and the love scenes were weird to say the least. The back cover promised a fun read with hints of pink plastic flamingos, crazy relatives and muscle cars. Some poor publisher was obviously stretching the truth in hopes of selling a book that shouldn't have made it to the presses in the first place.Daisy had several opportunities to tell Jack about their son. Instead, she was a coward for fifteen years and couldn't bring herself to say anything to him. When she finally went home to visit Lovett, Texas she flirted with Jack and she managed to seduce him, but up until the day she was leaving town she didn't say a single thing about their child. By the time I hit PAGE 193 in the book, I was irritated and ready to slam it against the wall. THE KID is the one who finally reveals himself to Jack. Keep in mind this is not a baby either. Nathan (said kid) is a snot-nosed, punk hair wearing teenager with an attitude. Did I mention the worst part? Daisy's husband was Jack's best friend. They married when she was pregnant with Jack's baby and took off to start a new life together in Seattle. There is no valid excuse for Daisy's withholding of the child - Jack is not a bad guy. In fact, Daisy is still very much in love with Jack.This book wreaks of immorality and promotes stereo-types that women have been trying to break down for centuries. Maybe I am annoyed because I have worked in family law and have dealt with a few cases like this. Yes, it makes sense to hide the identity of a child if biological daddy is a child molestor or is dangerous or was abusive. But the hero is this book was a Very Nice Guy who treated Daisy with respect. He was a gentleman. The minute he was made aware he had a child, he instantly tried to bond with his son. He went out of his way to spend every available moment he could with that kid. Jack's internal thoughts about missing out on his son's toddler years were heart-wrenching. It made me wish Daisy would get run over by one of those muscle cars or stabbed by a pink flamingo. Hated this book! Don't waste your money on it."}, {"userName": "Reed Raab", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5493642-reed-raab", "userReview": "Hey I just came back, and this is crazy, but 15 years ago, I had your baby.And I ran off with your best friend\u2026the week your parents died.

Y como necesito desahogarme voy a destripar el libro \u00bfvale?Bien tenemos a Daisy (en el instituto) que es una psicopata. Y lo digo porque si te pones como una loca cada vez que tu novio pone un pie fuera de casa sin que t\u00fa est\u00e9s con \u00e9l, ESO ES DE PSICOPATAS, ACOSADORAS OBSESIONADAS. Vamos, nada sano. Y tenemos a Jack, un chico malo por excelencia pero lo de malo no por nada importante, simplemente era un gamberro. Es amigo de Daisy y de Steven, el otro chico de este tr\u00edo (y ya ver\u00e9is que nunca mejor dicho). Bueno la historia empieza en que estos tres se hacen amigos pero como en todo libro, al final siempre les acaba gustando la chica. Pero a Daisy le gustan malos, as\u00ed que se \"queda\" y lo digo entre comillas s\u00ed, con Jack. Y digo eso porque se lo tira a escondidas (vete t\u00fa a saber que puta raz\u00f3n tiene, si luego se pone loca cuando lo ve actuar como si nada \u00a1no hab\u00e9rselo pedido loca de mierda!) y no quiere que Steven se entere. Bueno como comprender\u00e9is, no tienen cabeza ninguna y Daisy se encuentra con un k\u00ednder sorpresa, efectivamente, se queda embarazada de Jack. Y a ver pong\u00e1monos en situaci\u00f3n de los hechos hasta ahora: Daisy, loca psicopata acosadora, que no hace m\u00e1s que gritarle a Jack por cosas imaginarias, pel\u00edculas que se monta ella en su cabeza, est\u00e1 enamorada de \u00e9l pero no quiere que nadie la vea con el ( todo muy correcto).Jack, un chico perdidamente enamorado de Daisy, que quiere hacerla suya ante todo el mundo, pero que cede en no dec\u00edrselo a nadie por ella. De repente, sufre una desgracia, pierde a sus padres y su mundo se viene abajo. Tiene que cargar con un taller y un hermano. \u00bfAlguien no estar\u00eda abrumado por la responsabilidad? As\u00ed que el pobre Jack viendo que no pod\u00eda con esto y con la locura de Daisy, le pide un tiempo. Normal, yo tambi\u00e9n necesitar\u00eda respirar. Bueno entonces ahora comienza La pedazo de pel\u00edcula que se ha montado Daisy en su cabeza: como no puede entender que alguien est\u00e9 jodidamente hundido por la muerte de sus padres, por que claro eso debe ser tan raro como ver un unicornio, cuando se entera de que est\u00e1 embarazada, da por supuesto que Jack no lo va a soportar tampoco y se casa con Steven. TODO MUY OK!!!!! Por qu\u00e9 no eres una pedazo de zorra ni nada y encima vas y te casas con su otro amigo y te presentas en su casa para contarle que os hab\u00e9is casado pero no que estas embarazada... \u00bf\u00a1PERO TU ERES BIEN DE LA PUTA CABEZA!? Ya nos queda claro que no. Pero esperad esperad... NO HE ACABADO. El caso no lleg\u00f3 a su punto \u00e1lgido en el casamiento y el embarazo oculto, no... lleg\u00f3 en que Steven y Daisy se largaron del pueblo a vivir a Seattle y NUNCA y subrayo NUNCA JAM\u00c1S le dijeron a Jack que Daisy estaba embarazada. \u00bfSoy la \u00fanica cag\u00e1ndose en todos sus antepasados? As\u00ed que viven los tres, la familia feliz durante 15 a\u00f1os hasta que Steven se muere de un tumor. Y a Daisy de repente no se, debe venirle la inspiraci\u00f3n divina y se le ocurre contarle a Jack que tiene un hijo (QUINCE PUTOS A\u00d1OS DESPU\u00c9S SABES!!!!!???????) y claro no se igual esperaba llegar al pueblo y que Jack la recibiera con los brazos abiertos, porque no eres una pedazo de perra que te casaste con su mejor amigo, te largaste y lo dejaste tirado cuando m\u00e1s hundido estaba verdad? No que va querida, no fuiste t\u00fa, fue tu prima la coja. Bueno ya cuando se entera evidentemente Jack odia tanto a Daisy como a Steven (NOOOORMAL) pero la autora ha decidido hacer al mundo terriblemente comprensivo (e irreal porque nadie se lo cree) y Jack se supone que tiene que dejar el pasado atr\u00e1s y vivir el presente. POR SUPUEEEEESTO COMO NO! Me he perdido 15 a\u00f1os de la vida de un hijo QUE NO SAB\u00cdA QUE TEN\u00cdA pero venga no pasa nada vivamos felices y comamos perdices. PUES NO JODER NO ODIAAAAAA!!!! Es lo que ten\u00eda que hacer, yo nunca nunca se lo perdonar\u00eda, fueron 15 a\u00f1os sin tu hijo, 15 a\u00f1os que ese ni\u00f1o crey\u00f3 que su padre era otro y no porque el verdadero no lo quisiera o lo abandonase. Este libro ha sido lo peor que he visto porque creo que este tema se ha tratado a la ligera. Jackson y Daisy no deber\u00edan acabar juntos, ella deber\u00eda acabar sola y muerta de asco por ser tan mala persona. Me quedo con las palabras de Lilly, la hermana de Daisy:  \u00abLo lamento no son m\u00e1s que dos palabras, Daisy - le dijo su hermana -. Y no significan absolutamente nada si no las sientes de verdad. Ronnie me dec\u00eda que lo lamentaba cada vez que lo pillaba en una mentira, pero lo que realmente lamentaba era que lo hubiese pillado de nuevo. A veces decir lo lamento no es suficiente.\u00bb"}, {"userName": "Shawna", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802746-shawna", "userReview": "4 stars \u2013 Contemporary RomanceRachel Gibson is one of my favorite go-to, sure thing authors for when I need a fun, steamy contemporary romance with quirky characters, sexy, masculine, alpha heroes, and the perfect balance of lighthearted, fluffy feel-good entertainment, humor, and emotional angst.This is one of her mid-career works, and although not my favorite RG romance, it\u2019s still an entertaining tale with a piquant Texas twang.

Jackson, Daisy Lee, and Steven.. let's forward a few years and Daisy Lee and Jackson are an item, in love like every young couple with its ups and downs... Then Jackson's parents are killed in a drink driving accident, at the same time Daisy finds out she is pregnant.. So this stupid unbelievably ignorant heffer doesn't tell her best friend and boyfriend she runs to her other bff Steven.Now Steven was a piece of work, he always loved Daisy more than he should, and basically proposes to her, tells her to keep the baby a secret from Jackson (AGAIN, their mutual best friend, and Daisy's boyfriend) And guess what?This stupid bitch actually does it! She breaks Jackson's heart by leaving him and marrying Steven and moving away!Fast forward 15 years, she is back because Steven died.. Now I should feel bad and not talk about the ill and all but this is fiction and karma is a bitch!So she is back to tell Jackson he has a 15 year old son.Which has me thinking, had your precious Steven not died you would have never told Jackson about his kid, you selfish, horrible piece of shit excuse of a mother!So instead of telling him, she is spreading her legs for him... Now Nathan the 15 year old knows Steven wasn't his biological dad but he never questioned who his real dad is? Never seeked him out? He doesn't hate his mother for never telling his real father about him?Those are real emotions are 15 year old would have when finding this out, but oh no not Nathan he is calm, keeps throwing \"dad\" in Jackson's face when talking about Steven.. I mean the poor man is bleeding from the inside.I'm disgusted! Utterly disgusted. It's one thing keeping a baby because you're boyfriend is abusive and in the mafia.

So lets take her out of this drawer and into the ... none at all, she\u2019s obviously an author of many talents.It was a book hard to put aside, but also hard to read while having a big lump in the throat.The main plot is about Daisy, Jack and Steven who were very good friends growing up. And even though both boys (and later teenagers) were both in love with Daisy they agreed that she was \u201coff limits\u201d for both \u2013 easier said than done. Jack and Daisy started a crazy roller coaster relationship behind their friend\u2019s back. At the tender age of seventeen Daisy finds out she\u2019s pregnant with Jack\u2019s child, who in turn has just lost his parents and needs some space. With a teenage mind, Daisy freaks out, confides in Steven, who in turn offers to marry her and to look after her and the baby. Fifteen years later \u2013 Steven has just died of cancer and it is now Daisy\u2019s turn to tell Jack about his son.Phew! What dilemma and Rachel Gibson has done a wonderful job to stir the readers\u2019 emotions \u2013 I went from understanding to anger back to understanding. The dialogues are brilliant and for me were the part where the characters came alive. I think each reader will have a different point of view whether Daisy should have told Jack earlier or not, whether Steven is really the \u201cbaddie\u201d in the story by taking advantage of the situation or whether he really helped out of the good of his heart, whether Jack has a right to treat Daisy the way he does or the way he copes with his anger and loss \u2013 the loss of the time he had missed out on spending with his son.I really liked Daisy. I think we can all remember how confusing teenage years can be and I can in a way understand why she moved on with Steven, and in a way I can also understand why the decision to tell Jack had always been delayed to tomorrow \u2013 don\u2019t we all do that sometimes with things we feel uncomfortable with. I liked her also the way she understands Jacks anger and accepts his anger and accept the fact that there will be no future for them together if he isn\u2019t able to move forward. I loved Jack \u2013 for me the testosterone laden Texan man who is portrayed mainly as a sex-driven male, but over the period of the story becomes such a \u201cman\u201d by dealing with his past which is catching up with him, we feel for him that at an early age he did not only lose his parents, but the love of his life, his best friend and his son.I believe Rachel Gibson did a convincing job of showing us how that anger can eat at a person. My favourite quote: \"Mom,\" Nathan called to her.Daisy pulled her gaze from the tent and the fleeting glimpse of Jack's bare back, the smooth planes and indent of his spine, the sliver of the white elastic just above the blue waistband of his jeans...\"Hmm?\"\"What's a faaar ant?\" he asked just above a whisper.\"Fire.\" She chuckled and shook her head. \"Fire ant. They have a nasty bite that burns.\"Nathan smiled. \"Well, why didn't he just say fire?\"\"He thinks he did.\"I loved the book \u2013 it got my emotions going. Kudos to Rachel Gibson! Now where's the next book ....PS \u2013 Rachel\u2019s trademark of lengthy and detailed sex scenes are included as well"}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1881626-holly", "userReview": "This is a hard novel to read at times. The secret baby plot is a lot harder to swallow here, because the baby in question isn't really a baby - he's 15. For me, it's easy to forgive and forget when the heroine doesn't tell the hero right away about a baby, but only if it's cleared up early on. It's a lot harder to justify after 15 years of silence. I remember having an argument with a friend about Daisy's actions several years ago. She couldn't accept that Daisy had kept her son a secret for so long. I, on the other hand, understood Daisy's reasons for not telling him in the beginning. I also understood how the longer she went without telling, the easier it was not to. I can't say I agree with it or condone it, but I understand. On the night of Jack's parent's funeral, Daisy and Steven confronted him to tell him they'd gotten married - leaving out the part about the baby. 15 years go by. Steven dies and Daisy realizes she must tell Jack the truth about their son. She goes back to Lovett, TX (her hometown, where Jack still lives) to tell Jack the news, leaving Nathan (her son) behind in Seattle. All along Daisy always thought she did the right thing by not telling Jack, something Steven always fed into. But once she's back she realizes she made a mistake - that she robbed both Jack and Nathan of a relationship.I think one of the reasons this works for me is that Daisy realizes she made a mistake and tries her best to make it right. She doesn't let Jack run all over her, but she understands his anger.Jack is one of those over-the-top alphas who oozes sexual menace. While that can be off-putting in a lot of ways, it really worked here. I can't exactly say why it worked, but it did. His anger at Daisy is completely and totally justified, as is his anger at Steven. When he realizes the enormity of their betrayal..well, my heart broke for him. Not only did he lose the woman he loved and his son, but he lost his best friends as well. Watching Daisy and Jack move forward with their lives and come back together was really hard at times. I wanted them to work things out, but I wasn't sure how Jack could let go of his anger. I worried that the resolution would come too easily, or that the true conflict would be brushed aside. But that wasn't the case. Gibson did a credible job of showing us how that anger can eat at a person. Although parts of this novel are tough to get through, it's well worth reading. The characters individual struggles and hardships just make them that much more rounded and believable."}, {"userName": "ShoSho ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5577031-shosho", "userReview": "A little bit frustrating in the middle but overall a fantastic book."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6703235-ian", "userReview": "When Daisy left Lovett Texas 14 years ago it was with a broken heart after being dumped by her first love, Jackson.

Unfortunately, the aforementioned bee is now in my bonnet! I really disliked the heroine's behaviour. Her reasoning just wasn't acceptable to me.This is interesting because a similar situation occurs in Simply Irresistible, which is one of my favourites, but it didn't diminish the heroine's likeability at all. In fact I completely fell in love with her and understood her decisions. Perhaps I can excuse it because the child in that book was the product of a one night stand and the couple weren't invested in a real relationship. Or maybe because the child was still reasonably young when the father found out. But I don't understand how you could possibly forgive your girlfriend for running off with someone else, your best friend no less, and keeping your child a secret.Ok, rant over."}, {"userName": "Sophie \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14918997-sophie", "userReview": "He loves her.Jackson Lamott Parrish thought he'd seen the back of Daisy when she ran off with his best friend years ago.

Although this book didn't have much going for it in terms of the plot and characters it turned out to be another entertaining read from Rachel Gibson. She has a way of doing that. This book had a huge Texan flavour to it and Daisy is the stereotypical Texan gal - shiny hair, short dresses and cowgirl boots. She's definitely not one of those heroines many can relate to and you can't help but hate her sometimes. I was really annoyed with the fact that Daisy was essentially in love with two men. That didn't really work for me. Although she ends up working things out with Jackson, I couldn't help but think that it only ended up happening because of Steven's death. If she really loved Jackson then how did she live fifteen years without him? I thought that was unrealistic. My heart really broke for Jackson and I thought that Daisy could've handled things a lot better even in her circumstances. This was a fun read with a dose of Texan spice and Rachel Gibson wit.

Then I did and remembered exactly why. You guys know how much I hate kids and books and this has a kid in the story. So please keep in mind, that while this bothered me, it might not bother most normal readers that aren't bothered by kids in books at all. I don't regret re-reading this book and at the end of the story I didn't hate it, although it did annoy me plenty of times. But Gibson's usual writing charm won me over and I enjoyed this, even though it isn't my favorite book of hers. After losing her husband, Daisy is back in town to help out her sister as she is going through a nasty split-up with that rat bastard Ronnie (he's referenced as that in several books that take place in this town). She was expecting it to be a short trip and although she knew she might run into her high school boyfriend a few times, she didn't expect for all that passion and sexual tension and anger to still be there. Daisy and Jack didn't end their relationship in the best of terms. After Jack broke up with her after high school, Daisy married his best friend and left Lovett Texas for good. But, now 15 years later, she lost her husband to an illness and all those reasons and secrets that she thought she had left behind in Lovett are threatening to come back and bite her in the ass.Another reason Daisy had for coming back to town was to confess a few things to Jack. [spoiler] After Jack broke up years ago, she found out she was pregnant. She was scared and Jack's best friend agreed to marry her and help her raise her baby. They had other reasons for what they did, but their plan was always to tell him the truth about his son. Eventually. But a year turn into two and eventually 15 years went by and they never got around to it. I just can't wrap my mind around the reasoning on why Daisy felt it was okay to keep his son away from him for 15 years. It all works out in the end, but it was a tough road to get there and I was annoyed and angry with Daisy several times throughout the book. [/spoiler] Despite all the bad blood between Jack and Daisy, the attraction and old feelings are back and stronger than ever. I really did enjoy all the flirting and the tension between them and would have loved if the book focused on this more instead of the main issue. As always, I do enjoy Gibson's characters (other than Daisy, cause she annoyed me a few times) and the small town setting that she creates so well. I have to say, that despite my issues, I did enjoy this, just not as much as her other books. Audiobook Comments: I've heard a few books narrated by Kathleen Early at this point. While I think she did a really great job as Daisy, I have the same complaint as always. I really wish they would have had a male narrator for the male pov's. A female narrator for male POV chapters is always one of my pet peeves. I'm really glad that she didn't sound old, which is another pet peeve of mine with adult books. Other than that, this was another great performance by Kathleen and I will be listening to more books narrated by her in the future. Especially if they are Rachel Gibson books.3 out of 5 stars***Read full review & more of my reviews at Mostly YA Book Obsessed\nFollow me at:\nBloglovin\n\u2502\nTwitter\n\u2502\nTumblr\n\u2502\nPinterest\n\u2502\nPolyvore"}, {"userName": "LaFleurBleue", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8956777-lafleurbleue", "userReview": "[ and moreover pregnant with his baby (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Froggie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5485205-froggie", "userReview": "Secret baby plot is just not my thing.

Rachel Gibson can write a tale? I know, so much it makes you nauseous, but it is true. This is my first of her Lovett Texas series and I loved it. I can relate to Texas more than I can the northwest; Washington State is another of her venues. This book had the classic car loving Jack. He was a gear head from birth. He and Steven had a third best friend, Daisy. These three were like \u201cthree peas in a pod\u201d throughout their childhood. Both Jack and Steven were in love with Daisy but Jack was winning\u2026 Then, tragedy strikes on several fronts. Jack\u2019s world was upside down. Daisy gets clingy and he needs some distance from her. Daisy needed Jack in the worst way and when he pushed her away, she didn\u2019t know what to do and turned to Steven, their best friend. Steven was leaving to attend college in Washington State. He and Daisy ran away to get married and left Jack.Skip ahead 15 years. Steven has died \u2013 long bout of illness with terminal brain cancer. Daisy comes back to Lovett to make peace with Jack and the rest folks, is stuff of Texas legend. How do these two end up together? Well, it sure wasn\u2019t easy. Just ask Daisy.**Spoiler Alert START**I do have an issue with waiting 15 years to tell a man he has a child when everyone else in the whole blamed world knows it. Even the child [teen-age] knows it and has from the time he was little. He was caught completely unaware. He was madder than a dog stung by a bee, but he had every reason to be. I don\u2019t see how they could have gotten past this whopper. I wondered, if Steven hadn\u2019t died, would she have told Jack anything. She said the timing was never right. Would it have ever been right?If I wanted to get hung up on the story, and I very easily could have, I would lower my rating to 2 stars or less, just to make a point. The way Daisy and Steven handled the baby was wrong no matter how you looked at it. No way to convince yourself it was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d to keep the knowledge of this child from Jack. It would have been Jack\u2019s choice, what he did with the information. It was just so much easier this way. Very screwed up.**Spoiler Alert STOP** I\u2019m through with my rant and will leave my 4 star rating alone.Another really good Rachel Gibson read. I\u2019m on to read the next in the Writer\u2019s series. Starts with the \u201cwalk of shame\u201d, and ladies, who out there can say they haven\u2019t had this experience?Happy Reading!!"}, {"userName": "Nurhayat Turna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34869698-nurhayat-turna", "userReview": "Papatya Fal\u0131 - Rachel Gibson || Kitap YorumuRachel Gibson klasi\u011fidir bana g\u00f6re, ge\u00e7mi\u015fte ya\u015fad\u0131\u011f\u0131 yeri terk edip ileride geri d\u00f6n\u00fc\u015f olmas\u0131.

Daisy has got to be the most selfish character I have ever had the painful pleasure to meet she may think that she Nathan's best interest at heart but she is wrong she deprived him from his REAL fathers love Jack would have been a great father and she can't tell me that she did not know that yes I understand that she was a scared 18 year old driven by her change in hormones but what about the next 15 years? There was no reason not to tell Jack it was not like he was abusive he was a good human being even when he was younger. What she did for lack of a better word was barbaric Jack had just lost both of his parents and in the same week he was betrayed by the love of his life and his best friend, Jack deserved no deserves better than that and it wasn't like Daisy changed that much she practically forced Jack to forgive her after she took 15 years of his life away saying that love was not enough for them to have a future together what she was really saying is that he was not enough just like before but the truth is that she is not enough not even close if she cannot see how good Jacks heart really is. God knows how Jack forgave her after everything she did but I will never forgive her Billy is right she is and forever will be an 'evil b***h'.I'm going to have to give this book a 3 although RG is a great writer and kept a smile on my face and I love Jack but I cannot get over how someone like Daisy could even exist!"}, {"userName": "Cindi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1940550-cindi", "userReview": "I picked this book specifically for Valentine's Day reading because I wanted a cute, maybe silly, easy read. Many of Rachel Gibson's books are just that for me; I love her contemporaries. But Daisy is not silly or easy tp read about. She is, however, extremely cute. Jack, her high school beau, acknowledges that she's still cheerleader-cute but he has spent the past 15 years hating her for getting married to his best friend, Stephen (nevermind that the day before he'd told her \"he needed some space\", and every girl knows what THAT really means!) and moving away to Seattle. But now Daisy's whole life has turned upside down after Stephen lost his 2 year fight with cancer. She's come back home to Lovett, Texas to tell Jack that he is the father of her 15 year old son, Nathan.By page 208 I was crying as Jack read a letter from Stephen; by page 281 I wanted to sit Jack down and FORCE him to listen to Daisy. By the end of this story, my eyes were red and puffy from tears but I learned about what unforgiveness can do to your insides and hold you back from going on with your life.

I found myself wishing that I wasn't getting closer to the end. Now I'm depressed because it is done and I want more. I LOVE Rachel Gibson's way of creating characters that you want to know and be friends with. They are so real to me. Daisy Monroe has come back to her home town after fifteen years to tell the man she once loved that she had his baby all those years ago, and married his best friend to give the baby and name and life that he may have not been able to give them. But she finds that Jack is still the love of her heart after all these years. Will he be able to forgive her and move on after she tells him about his son? Jackson Parrish is a man that had to grow up really fast. Right after graduation from High School his parents were killed in a horrible car accident. then only days later the girl he loves marry's his best friend and breaks his heart.

She manages to pack both hilarity and emotional in most of her books, and this one did not disappointment. I loved that Daisy honest-to-goodness messed up. There were no misunderstandings that caused 15 years of pain. She truly, and royally messed up. And this book was about not letting bitterness swallow you whole and learning to forgive. It's a hard thing when you are justified in your anger to figure out how to move forward. This book kept me up most nights just to get to the end. My only complaint was that it just sort of ended.

Grade BRachel Gibson, as previous reviews may also have indicated, follows a clich\u00e9d storyline with slight variations that features two independent adults who get into a relationship purely because of sex, but \u2018accidentally\u2019 fall in love. However, they continue to live in denial till a major conflict drives them apart only to bring them together forever once the problem is solved. Her books are funny but predictable. Nevertheless, they are highly addictive for some romance junkies like me.Initially, I was very excited to read Daisy\u2019s back in town for two reasons \u2013 a) it was the one RG book I couldn\u2019t find ANYWHERE and b) it was my favorite plot \u2013 High-school-sweethearts-reunite-and-live-happily-ever-after. Sadly, it failed to live up to my expectations.He loves me not.Daisy Lee Monroe thought she\u2019d brushed the dust of Lovett, Texas, off her high-heeled shoes years ago, but she\u2019s come back home only to find that little has changed. Her sister is still crazy, and her mom still has pink plastic flamingos in her front yard. And Jackson Lamott Parrish, the bad boy she left behind, is still so sexy it hurts. She\u2019d like nothing better than to avoid this particular man, but she can\u2019t. Daisy has something to say to Jackson, and she\u2019s not going anywhere until he listens.He loves her not.Jackson learned his lesson about Daisy the hard way, and now the only word he\u2019s interested in hearing from Daisy\u2019s red lips is good-bye. But she\u2019s popping up everywhere, and he doesn\u2019t believe in coincidence. It seems the only way to keep her quiet is with his mouth, but kissing Daisy had once been his downfall. Is he strong enough to resister her now? Strong enough to watch her walk out of his life again? Is he strong enough to make her stay?Daisy, who had departed young, na\u00efve and heartbroken comes back a lady; confident, accomplished and definitely not heartbroken. She has a business to run and a sixteen year old son to look after who, incidentally, shares the same genes as Jackson, her ex-flame from fifteen years ago. Jackson hates Daisy with a passion, and why wouldn\u2019t he, she ran off with her best friend/his brother, while he was busy being an insensitive jerk on account of his parents sudden death. Now, with the brother conveniently dead, \u2018Daisy\u2019s back in town\u2019 to tell Jack the truth about their son and bear all punishments like a self sacrificing, helpless maiden who hasn\u2019t heard of a lawyer, EVER. From then on, they crash into each other too frequently, engage in not-so-friendly banters and deal with sexual frustration all the time.In the end, after reading a long lost letter, from his dead brother Stephen, Jack comes to his senses and finally accepts Daisy, who for a change isn\u2019t groveling at his feet. Jack definitely has a LOT of anger issues that remain unacknowledged.\u201cMom\u201d, Nathan called to her.Daisy pulled her gaze from the tent and the fleeting glimpse of Jack\u2019s bare back, the smooth planes and indent of his spine, the sliver of the white elastic just above the blue waistband of his jeans.\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201c What\u2019s a faaar ant?\u201d he asked just above a whisper.\u201c Fire.\u201dShe chuckled and shook her head.\u201cFire ant. They have a nasty bite that burns.\u201dNathan smiled. \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t he just say fire?\u201d\u201c He thinks he did.\u201dThe only scene that was remotely likeable was their picnic to the riverside. It was funny how, without even trying, they managed to behave and look like a happy little family. Jack catches a fish and bonds with his son and they together make fun of Daisy. It was believable, unlike the rest of the book, and a refreshing break from their usual fights.Not the best book by Rachel Gibson but worth a read.Originally reviewed at : www.the-vault.co.cc"}, {"userName": "Rom\u00e9e Wanders", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17685234-rom-e-wanders", "userReview": "Dit boek is echt de shit.Een paar dagen geleden schreef ik nog dat alle Rachel Gibson mannen piece-of-shits zijn.
