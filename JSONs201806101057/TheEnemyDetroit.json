Her best friend Bernadette is frequently absent with earaches, and things are odd at home. The family has taken in a high school boy, Frank, whose parents are dead, and her father suffers PTSD from being in WWII. Her mother is hiding books that the public library was going to burn because of their \"Communist\" themes. When a new girl sits by Marjorie during class, she is friendly, but doesn't want to be friends with Inga because she is clearly German, although she claims to have moved from Canada. With all the talk about Communist sympathizers, Marjorie doesn't want to get drawn into friendships that may make her look suspect and put her father's job in jeopardy. Strengths: Wow. I don't know that I've ever read a book that drew me so clearly to a particular time. The details of every day life in 1954 Detroit are exquisite. The thing that really blew me away, however, was the depiction of a time when almost all of the fathers had fought in the war. We don't think about that aspect of the Baby Boom, but it's true. Kurlansky's Battle Fatigue talked about it a little, but this really brought the concept home. It made the whole idea of fighting Communists in the public library seem a little more plausible to me. The other thing that I've not read in another middle grade book is the idea of rampant prejudice. Bernadette (whom I'm assuming is Catholic) isn't allowed to have Lutherans in her home. Negroes live south of 8 Mile Road. We just fought the Japs and the Krauts, so we certainly don't want to hang out with them. I grew up hearing this sort of talk from my aunts and uncles, and being appalled by it, but it was certainly a part of the culture. Given the current circumstances, I think this is important to find out. Children today really don't understand why people were opposed to Kennedy-- hopefully, it won't take 50 years for other prejudices to work themselves out! We clearly need more books about the Baby Book experience! (I missed that generation by 6 months!)Weaknesses: The print is a bit small, and there's not a huge general plot. Not that I minded-- Marjorie's relationship with Inga would have been enough for me. What I really think: This is worth buying if only for the scene where Marjorie and Inga's fathers get together for coffee and talk about their experiences during the war-- fighting on opposite sides. Chills. So good!"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "This wonderful piece of historical fiction is set in Detroit in 1954, a year before I was born. Although I grew up in the rural South, I could still relate to many of the events the author describes here as well as the xenophobia that plagued her school and neighborhood, and dare I say, our nation. As I read the book\u2014and I don\u2019t know how I managed to miss it earlier\u2014I couldn\u2019t help but think about today\u2019s political climate and the hatred and fear that are fomented toward those that are different from the rest of us or who we have learned to call \u201cthe enemy.\u201d The book covers a lot of territory and cuts a wide swath in examining how many of the citizens of this country as well as others often give blind allegiance to their leaders and elected officials. If this all sounds familiar, it just be that in some respects we\u2019ve returned to the days of the Cold War, the red scare, and the witch hunt led by Senator Joseph McCarthy in those days. The narrator, twelve-year-old Marjorie Campbell leads a life not far removed from most youngsters in those times. Her father suffers from PTSD as the result of his military service, and many Americans still bear grudges toward the Nazis and Germans after WWII as well as harboring fears about Russians and communism. Marjorie is no exception to this rule, but a small crack in her veneer occurs when her teacher assigns her to befriend a new student. Inga Scholtz may have recently arrived from Canada, but it is clear that her origins were in Germany. Marjorie is torn between acting kindly to the girl and staying in the good graces of her best friend, Bernadette Ferguson. Unfortunately, often she shuns Inga because the rest of her classmates are, as they belittle Inga and make fun of her culture and clothing. Things escalate as Bernadette suggests that the girls write in a slam book through which they will ask and answer questions about Inga. Although this might seem to be a trivial matter, it is intended to be cruel and to align the girls even further against the young German girl. Eventually Marjorie does the right thing, but it takes almost the entire book before she does so, and seeing her father\u2019s willingness to move past the wounds of the war and his awareness that the men on the other side of the conflict were humans just like him, caught up in a war machine. I thoroughly enjoyed this exploration of an ethical dilemma from the aisles of a typical American classroom as well as the plotlines about book banning and her mother\u2019s college education, which seemed somehow to set her apart from others\u2014and not in a good way. While it might seem that we\u2019ve come a long, long way, baby, in other respects, we seem to be going backward in time. If this story seems personal, in many ways it is as the author based some of the characters and experiences on those of her own family. Like many, I\u2019ve always enjoyed Sara Holbrook\u2019s poetry so I am delighted to see her first novel. There are many passages that made me laugh as well as some that made me wince, and others that left me troubled as I pondered how I might have behaved if I had been in Marjorie\u2019s shoes. While this novel covers territory not usually explored in books for young readers, it does so through a narrator with whom most of them can relate. I appreciated the inclusion of complex characters and subtle references to the economic differences among the families in Marjorie's neighborhood as well as the examination of life after a war or a conflict ends."}, {"userName": "Kimbra Power", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3220608-kimbra-power", "userReview": "Where has Sara Holbrook been hiding her talent for fiction all these years? I've only known her as a poet, and an outspoken and wonderful one at that, so to pick up her brand new novel and finish it in one setting has blown me away; what a page turner. The book has an easily accessible lead character, Marjorie, who is struggling with her surroundings, her family and her friendships. Marjorie is growing up in turbulent 1950's America, and battles prejudice in its many guises. The book, although set 60 years ago, is EERILY relevant today in, I mean seriously-references to the Orwell classic 1984, talk of taking down the enemy and the toxic mentality of fear permeate as a theme, then, and now. I can easily see this novel being used as a reference book for this turbulent period in time, the 1950's, and imagine it will be popular as a classroom text used in book groups from 5th grade and up.

It\u2019s no surprise that her first novel for young readers, The Enemy: Detroit 1954, is perfectly in sync with our troubled times.Holbrook\u2019s main character Marjorie Campbell is twelve years old as the atrocities of World War II are still etched in the minds of Americans, although children of her age have no direct memories of them. Many are also preoccupied with the Cold War fears of creeping Communism. For Marjorie and other children, these perceptions are playing out for real in their Detroit neighborhood when books deemed subversive (1984, The Grapes of Wrath) are removed from library shelves, and newcomers are treated with suspicion. When Marjorie is assigned to share a desk with the just-arrived Inga, she is torn between her instinct to be friendly and her classmates\u2019 intentions to be unwelcoming.Holbrook respects her readers by presenting the complexity of Marjorie\u2019s situation. Members of her family and community have been directly affected by the war, and they harbor negative attitudes toward Germans and DPs (displaced persons). Others are concerned with over-reaching attempts to limit freedoms in the name of safeguarding against Communism. Marjorie takes it all in, and then relies on her heart to make decisions about how she will navigate her neighborhood and her world.Marjorie\u2019s voice in The Enemy is charmingly innocent, smart, and vulnerable. Here is her description of one of the local librarians: \u201cMrs. Pearson has her arms crossed tightly, the way she always does. Crossed arms are as natural to her as breathing. It makes me wonder how she opens a car door or flushes a toilet. I imagine she was born with her arms crossed, telling the doctor to keep it down as soon as she opened her eyes.\u201d Sara Holbrook definitely knows how kids think and speak.Today\u2019s middle school and high school students are well aware of what is going on around them. They see the protests and hear the inflammatory rhetoric. Reading The Enemy: Detroit 1954 in a time when our government is focused on creating a classes of \u201cothers\u201d through harsh characterizations and targeted immigration policies will give adolescents a context for processing their own roles in today\u2019s swirling events, and considering whether \u201cthe enemy\u201d is outsiders or dark impulses closer to home.Cross-posted in slightly different form on my What's Not Wrong? blog"}, {"userName": "Mary Lee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221992-mary-lee", "userReview": "I think this is the first children's/YA book I've read that's set during the Cold War. Through lots of specific details, Holbrook gives the reader a good feel for the time and the place (Detroit).The scary thing is, this is a story for today -- racism, fear of immigrants, threat of nuclear annihilation (without the air raid sirens...so far), bullies, PTSD. But it is also a story filled with hope. When Marjorie's father welcomes a Inga's father, a German immigrant, into his home to compare war stories, it gives her the courage to stand up to her neighbor/friend/the main bully and do the right thing for Inga."}, {"userName": "Cindy Mitchell *Kiss the Book*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19521241-cindy-mitchell-kiss-the-book", "userReview": "Holbrook, Sara The Enemy, 243 pages. Highlights (Calkins Creek), 2017. $18. Language: G (swear count 0); Mature Content: PG; Violence: PG.It\u2019s 1954 in Detroit, Michigan. Cold-war McCarthyism has a grip on the city and twelve-year-old Marjorie doesn\u2019t know what to think. What\u2019s a Nazi? What\u2019s a Commie? Who is our enemy? Where are they hiding? Why are books being pulled from the library shelves? Her father served in World War II and now works for Chrysler Corporation. Her mother went to college during the war and now stays at home to take care of Marjorie and her sister. Then there is Frank, the teenager who comes to live with them after his father, also a veteran, dies of \u201cunnatural causes.\u201d Life is complicated enough before the arrival of the new immigrant family in the neighborhood. Her classmates make fun of the new girl with her different hair, different clothes, and different accent. Through it all, Marjorie finds the courage to be a true friend and stand up for what she believes is right.Drawing on personal experience, author Sara Holbrook creates a work of historical fiction that is still relevant today. At times a bit slow, the book tries to capture the feeling of paranoia that spread across American society as the Soviet Union began to rise as a global power. The reader can sense Marjorie\u2019s curiosity and confusion as she tries to understand why some families reject cultures and religions that other families embrace. The dilemma of inclusion versus exclusion as it related to European immigrants in the 1950\u2019s parallels the current political debates about immigrants from Middle Eastern countries. Holbrook also manages to bring in the tween girl experience about true friends, family secrets, and crushes on boys that even the modern reader can relate to.EL, MS \u2013 OPTIONAL.

Set in the 1950s and told through the lens of a middle school girl. Marjorie is dealing with some big issues -- the Cold War, McCarthyism, banned library books, her father's PTSD, mean girls with slam books, a new student from Germany, and a new older brother living in the basement her family took in when he was orphaned. My favorite character was her strong mother who went to college in an era when many women did not and when jobs for women were listed separately in the classified section.From page 25:\"My mother's a college graduate.It's true.It happened during the war because her daddy didn't want her hands turning dirty in a factory helping the war effort, so he sent her off to a safe place with ivy all over it. She never lies about going to college, but she doesn't bring it up either. Probably because, like Dad says, it doesn't help her do the dishes any better than the next woman. It's almost a family secret, like a birthmark or my grandpap's horse-thieving uncle who had his name cut out of the family Bible. Something we don't talk about.\"And I loved her mother's commentary on the importance of books!From pages 188-189:\"She talks fast. 'You asked me why I went to college and the answer is because Grandpa Henry told me to go. But you didn't ask me what I learned there. I learned this: Books, like the books upstairs, they stretch your brain, so there's enough room for lots of ideas: good ideas, bad ideas, ideas different than the ideas you grow up with. From those ideas you can make your own ideas, different ideas. Different is a good way to be. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. When people try too hard to be the same, that's when the shooting starts.\"This book is on the 2018-2019 Maine Student Book Award list and we have it in our Learning Commons collection thanks to Junior Library Guild."}, {"userName": "Valerie McEnroe", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4294664-valerie-mcenroe", "userReview": "I've been reading a lot of books about the Cold War lately and this is one to read if you have an interest. It describes the anti-German sentiment that permeated American culture in the 50s and 60s. There was much less tolerance for cultural differences back then and Detroit was one of the melting pot cities. This book is based loosely on the author's own experiences growing up in Detroit.Marjorie is very aware of the anti-Nazi/anti-Communist atmosphere around her. Communists are called Commies and immigrants are called DPs for displaced persons. WW2 is still fresh in people's minds and they have no tolerance for Germans. When a new German girl named Inga joins her class and she is instructed to share her desk since there are no others, Marjorie is faced with a moral dilemma. She wants to be nice to Inga and help her learn to read English, but she knows it will jeopardize her friendship with the popular, but intolerant, Bernadette. Her father, a retired military man, who works for a company with ties to the military, is socially aware of the importance to not appear to be a Communist sympathizer. So it's interesting that at the end of the book he invites Inga's father over to their house to talk about the war. In the end, Marjorie stands up to Bernadette. Her father's message is that war is bad, not people, so you must forgive and forget."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40626880-dawn", "userReview": "\"Set in 1954, this compelling historical novel tells the story of a young girl\u2019s struggles and triumphs in the aftermath of World War II.

So she worries when she's stuck sitting next to the new girl, Inga, from Canada. Inga is a German refugee, and many in Detroit, including Marjorie's father, still bear the scars of the war. What's more, the red scare is in full swing. It doesn't take long for Bernadette to start plotting against the new girl, and she expects Marjorie to join in. But Marjorie starts to realize that, German or no, she likes and respects Inga.Marjorie is a very real young girl, and I loved the family relationships and the difficult early adolescent friendships. Marjorie's mom is a real heroine!Summing up, this is very well crafted historical fiction that will also appeal to fans of realistic fiction and family stories.

She was a delight and this book really caught my eye. There isn't a lot of middle grade Cold War fiction, so I wanted to check it out. I'm really glad I did. Marjorie is a fun MC. She learns to accept others even when they are decidedly different from you. More importantly, she learns to stand up for what's right even if it's unpopular. I think that, even though this is historical fiction, there are many applicable lessons for today's kids. Also, a nagging aggravation: why are middle grade books filled with good parents, but in YA your hard-pressed to find enough to make a library social media post for mother's/father's day?? Do parents randomly get worse as soon as their kids become teens? Or, and this just came to mind, are YA parents awful bc teens have a shifting view of their parents? At Marjorie's age, she still recognizes their value and their intelligence. Maybe at 16, she would begin to think they are nothing more than stupid burdens who limit her horizons. Maybe that's why you see so many good parent relations in adult fiction--adults have shifted the pendulum back to respect for their parents. Hmm.

Until the plot gently veered off-course and I found myself pleasantly surprised by the direction it had taken. Marjorie is super average, nothing special, just your everyday tween/teen dealing with friends, bullies, teachers, and family struggles. But lightly layered on top of all that typical stuff is her father's PTSD, a new girl in school who may (or may not) be an (ex)Nazi, Communist threats at her local library, a young man who comes to live with her family because his father committed suicide, and underlying all this is the never-entirely-straightly-asked-question about what it means to be American.I wish the library plot thread didn't fade into the background, but other than that, I am a big fan of this story."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2511660-cindy", "userReview": "A fascinating read for older elementary or middle school students.
