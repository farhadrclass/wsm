King uses Maine as the blueprint to his stories, while Fulton uses the rain-starved South. She bounces from townfolks to townsfolk to capture the full impact of the horror that this drought and the mysterious happenings that have plagued these two towns.Yes, two towns. I typically skip reading Chapter titles and subtext, so it wasn\u2019t until seven or eight chapters in that I realized that half the characters are located on Junction, Texas and half in Reserve, Louisiana. The story made much more sense when I figured that out. My bad.This is an author who knows how to gain from head-hopping. For example, one of the major characters is Jared, a young boy whose father has been missing since he was little and a mother who is losing her marbles. Jared rides his bike down the street carrying a week\u2019s worth of laundry. He sees the temperature sign on the bank tease him by dropping a degree and then immediately went back up to 109. So he flicks off the sign. At that moment, the focus switches to Frank. He\u2019s inside the bank watching Jared flick off the sign and start yelling and he starts laughing at the kid\u2019s rediculous behavior. He reminds himself to tell his wife, Marcy, about this when he gets home. The focus switches again to Marcy, who is running naked through the streets, the latest example of an odd behavior performed by a local, and then Marcy gets hit by an automobile, the driver a woman only in town to research the drought.Before the scene comes to a close, the author brings us back to Frank who thinks that it would of be a hysterically funny sight to see his wife and her floppy breasts running down Main Street. And then it hits him that she\u2019s now dead, and he starts sobbing. This kind of head-hopping made me feel like I was part of the town, rather than attached to only one or two characters. And when the town unravels completely, it felt like my hometown that was being destroyed.And it\u2019s probably for the best that we\u2019re not dependent on only one or two characters to weave this story, because there are multiple deaths and disappearances. No character is safe and that\u2019s how I like my horror novels.There\u2019s magic and Voodoo, but its set as realistic as possible. We find out that the drought is caused by a curse last unleashed fifty years ago and only ended after the deaths of several children. Gypsies were blamed and punished. This time around a new scapegoat is chosen, and it is a very unlikely choice.I have few complaints about this book. I nearly gave it full stars. One problem was that in two chapters near the end the quotations aren\u2019t properly used during Narried\u2019s monologues. There are open quotations and no end quotations, leaving me a little confused to how much of certain sections were narration or dialogue. It\u2019s a minor issue that I\u2019m sure will be fixed in later editions. Most of the novel is polished grammatically speaking, so do NOT pass on the novel just for that.The other issue I had is the ending. Granted, I\u2019m typically disappointed in endings in horror novels. And horror movies for that matter. The ending felt \u201ccheesy\u201d to me. Looking back, it makes sense how it ended. All elements of the novel led up to that particular ending. I just wish that it was\u2026well, I can\u2019t figure out how to explain without spoilers, so I\u2019ll end it there.Overall, this is a great horror novel. The atmosphere and setup is amazingly crafted. Like I said, this nearly hit 5 stars. Patricia Fulton is definitely a horror novelist to watch. I\u2019ll definitely check out her next book."}, {"userName": "David Caldwell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082045-david-caldwell", "userReview": "I won a copy on Goodreads Firstreads.It all starts with the heatwave and massive drought.As the temperature climbs, bizarre events start to occur in the towns of Junction,Texas and Reserve,Louisana.Animals go missing,people start acting crazy and people start to go missing and dying.People from both towns try to uncover what is really happening only to drawn deeper into the mystery that links the two towns.Horror has a couple of hurdles to overcome.First, the author has to contibue growing suspense without overloading the reader with horrific events.The second problem is that the characters have to be as interesting as the villian.The final problem is that the ending needs to be satisfying.It shouldn't be too easy or impossible for the heroes to win. Patricia Fulton manages to overcome all of these problems with ease.She manages to have the suspense build from the very beginning until the final confrontation.While there are some gory events along the way, you never feel like she is just throwing buckets of blood at you.Think more like a Hitchcock movie instead of A hightmare on Elm Street movie.Her characters are strong while remaining human.That even includes Agador.Her ending is very satisfying.I would say Patricia Fulton hit a home run with her first novel.She will be one to watch.This is one of the best horror novels I have read recently."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "Echoing themes of Eerie Indiana, Children of the Corn and Under the Dome, this book features a small town where the supernatural is driving all the residents insane. It got a little weird and confusing at times, but overall it was a pretty good book."}, {"userName": "Scott Whitmore", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8239695-scott-whitmore", "userReview": "An engrossing, thrilling and immensely satisfying debut novel that strongly reminded me of the best of Stephen King. If you get this book, and I highly recommend you do, expect to be pulled deeply into the deep and twisting story about good and evil from the first paragraph. The temperatures are hot and getting hotter, and there's no sign of rain in Junction, Texas. Many of the old-timers have experienced conditions like this before, and they know what's coming. A rancher kills his best livestock before turning the gun on himself, just the first of a series of disturbing events in the small town.Meanwhile on the other end of the drought, the heat is also rising as a small-town sheriff in Louisiana makes a gruesome and surprising discovery. The drought has been here before, too, and some people are worried about what the return of the hot, dry weather may mean.These two threads, and many more, are woven together in The Drought by Patricia Fulton (@pfulton2), a finalist in The Kindle Book Review's Best Indie Books of 2012 contest and most deservedly so. Scanning the list of semi-finalists for the contest (my book was one as well), the premise of The Drought caught my eye; I couldn't wait to see how the author would deliver on the cover tagline: \"Killer heat is only the beginning.\" The short answer is: Ms. Fulton delivered a great read that surprised and thrilled me in equal measure. Ms. Fulton lived through a drought in Texas, and that experience informs her wonderfully gritty description of what happens to the landscape and people during extended and relentless sun and heat. The characters are varied and believable \u2014 not an easy feat considering the wide range of ages and backgrounds in her cast \u2014 the plot moves relentlessly forward and there are more than a few truly creepy moments. No spoilers, but the author spends about the first half of The Drought setting the stage, laying out the pieces of the puzzle as it were, and then the pay off starts as the various plotlines begin to come together and the story behind the story comes into focus. The ending is, well, pretty neat.I don't know about you, but I really enjoy stories like that. I haven't read much of Stephen King's recent work \u2014 The Dark Tower series was the latest for me \u2014 but I greatly enjoyed earlier novels like Salem's Lot, The Shining and especially The Stand. One chapter into The Drought and I was checking Ms. Fulton's bio on Goodreads to see, sure enough, she considered King an influence. It shows, because reading her debut novel was for me like taking a trip back in time to when I devoured The Stand, reading late into the night because I had to find out what would happen next in that great good vs. evil epic. I'm not a big fan of comparison (\"If you like this, you'll like that\"), but for Indie authors I absolutely understand how making a connection helps potential readers make the decision to try an unknown name. If you enjoy Stephen King or Dean Koontz, I'm confident you will love Patricia Fulton's The Drought. But don't think for a moment you'll be getting a less-expensive imitation like a Times Square \"Rolex.\" The Drought stands on its own merits as a great read with thrills and chills \u2014 yep, even in all that burning heat, you'll shiver."}, {"userName": "Suzannesky1", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5673127-suzannesky1", "userReview": "Ohmygosh! This book starts off fast, getting right into the excitment, action, mystery and intrigue. The book is crammed full of tense, brooding moments. What a story it is - layers upon layers of richness. Parts of it are very reminescent of Stephen King's way of writing. The characters were many and were all drawn so well. I could not put this book down for long, even snatching minutes here and there from a really busy two days. I'll definately be watching for Patricia Fulton's books in the future!"}, {"userName": "Royal", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9772074-royal", "userReview": "This is a book that is written to keep you turning the pages.

Every second is pure torture for the poor residents who simply can't cool down no matter what they do. Soon some of them begin losing their minds while others turn into killers. Young Jared can't explain it but he knows that the heat is stirring up a whole lot of trouble. Can he get to the bottom of this mess before he winds up dead too?Initially, the set up of this story was brilliant. The hot spell was described so intricately and effectively that I could almost feel myself sweating as I read. It was easy to feel sorry for the characters - from the kids to the adults. The sinister voices urging them to hurt others were creepy and mysterious. They brought up numerous questions such as whose voices were those? What was their purpose? Were the voices real or were the characters imagining them due to the oppressive heat? At this point it was suspenseful and exciting.However, somewhere along the way I lost interest mainly because there were constant switches between myriad characters. It didn't help that none of them were particularly likeable. Some parts were confusing as the author would suddenly delve into a character's past without writing it in such a way that clearly indicated it was something that had already happened. Most of the time the switch would happen just when things were getting really interesting. That was simply too annoying for words.The supernatural aspect was certainly well-thought-out complete with an aptly disturbing background story but the last third of the book was too drawn out for my liking. The level of gore was ramped up without serving any purpose except perhaps to disgust the reader. Prior to that, violent and bloody moments were written without going into too much detail. In contrast, the last third was chock-full of too much of everything - blood, guts and action to the point where none of those packed any punch.Overall, 'The Drought' started off well only to take a quick nosedive mostly caused by having too many characters who were terribly one-dimensional and lacking focus."}, {"userName": "CJ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54598-cj", "userReview": "Jared Riley knows something is wrong in his hometown of Junction, Texas. His mother's headaches are getting worse, one of his good friends disappeared down a drainpipe, and the temperature seems to have taken on a mind of its own, bent on destroying the town and everyone in it. People are losing their minds, and strange things are happening. It's up to a small group of concerned citizens to figure out what's happening and try to stop it before it's too late.I liked this book a lot. The characters all felt reasonably realistic, and I was interested in their stories and anxious to find out what would happen to them (though in some cases the answer would be \"nothing good.\") The plot moved along, though I felt there was a little drag in the middle while the characters were trying to put all the pieces together. I really wanted them to hurry up and combine forces. On the whole, this was a good read that utilized atmosphere, description, and suspense really effectively, while letting the personalities of the characters shine through and do the heavy lifting of the story. I'll definitely check out any further works from this author!"}, {"userName": "Jorgen Sch\u00e4fer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7447506-jorgen-sch-fer", "userReview": "In the ghost story The Draught by Patricia Faulton, an oppressive heat builds up around the town of Junction, Texas. The draught stretches on and on, and slowly, people start to go crazy. A farmer kills all his cattle and then himself. And finally, a boy crawls into a drainage shaft and is not found anymore. The heat seems intent on leaving only after everyone in the down is dead.I\u2019m usually not a big fan of ghost stories, but this one is really, really well written. The supernatural in the book only slowly appears, allowing for plenty of naturalistic explanations for the events for most of the book. Something I really like in such books.
