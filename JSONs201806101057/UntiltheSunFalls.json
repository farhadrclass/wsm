To me, Until the Sun Falls seems like the last episode in a TV series in the absence of the series itself. The reader is dropped\u2014without benefit of preparation\u2014in medias (or better, ultimas) res, as Psin, a Merkit Khan, sets off, with the Mongol general, Subutai and assorted others, to conquer Russia and parts west (Europe) ... in what retroactively proves to be the last expansion of the Mongol empire. And I\u2014who have some background on the Mongols\u2014was initially at sea (bestepped?). This novel is absolutely not what some seem to think it is, an \u201cintroduction\u201d to the Mongol conquest, depicting as it does its end, while barely addressing the rich history (and much culture) leading to the action\u2019s start. Temujin was acclaimed Genghis Khan\u2014leader of the Mongol confederation he created by diplomacy and warfare\u2014in 1206. Until the SunFalls takes place two generations later (Batu, son of Ghenghis Khan\u2019s oldest son, is one of the characters), sometime between the late 1230\u2019s and 1241. All that falls between is essentially a void when the novel begins. For example, Subutai was a general under both Genghis Khan\u2019s and his son Ogedei, directing more than twenty campaigns in which he conquered thirty-two nations and won sixty-five pitched battles, conquering more territory than any other commander in history. None of this is even hinted at in the novel; he is just another personage ... important, yet peripheral to Psin. But then, who the heck is Psin himself, the principal character, a Merkit? Who, or what, were Merkits? I could go on ... but the fact is that Until the Sun Falls is a historical novel deeply and sadly lacking in historical context. And this novel dropped into a historical void scarcely fares better in the matter of culture ... unless you know nothing about Mongols to begin with. Yurts and kumiss are there of course (as well as other essential Mongolian etceteras) but the narrative in no way provides a dense richness of cultural detail\u2014a fact underscored as I am currently revisiting The Once and Future King, which is wonderfully laden, however ironically, with precisely that. And the novel\u2019s cultural poverty is echoed in the language, for Until the Sun Falls has almost no Mongolian in it, other than proper names.... Explanatory apparatus\u2014maybe a preface and maps\u2014would also have helped orient the reader. This novel attempts too much in too little space (an ironic contrast to the Mongolian enterprise itself). And that little space itself is weirdly chosen. Why, of all the Mongol expansion, did Holland choose the last of that conquest as her single slice of their life...? Personally, I feel that she selected this \u201csunset\u201d moment (to echo the title) because at that late date\u2014having conquered much of the world\u2014Mongols at last pitted themselves against Europe. The unvarnished truth is, of course, that the Mongols had no more problems galloping roughshod over Russians, Poles and Hungarians than they did over anyone else, and, to her great credit, Holland makes this clear. Also, as the novel is about to end, the Mongols are setting their sights on the Holy Roman Empire, and Holland in no way makes this conquest seem impossible. On the contrary, the irresistible Mongol momentum that comprises the action of her novel underscores that possibility.... At bottom, then, Until the Sun Falls is an exercise in \u2018What if? It invites us to envision the imminent conquest of Europe, and a consequent \u201crewriting\u201d of all modern European history (giving the title further resonance). However, the novel ends as the Mongol forces suddenly withdraw (as historically they did), not in any way defeated, but because Ogedei, the Khan of Khans, has died in distant Karakorum, capital of the empire....Until the Sun Falls is therefore what the French call a roman a th\u00e8se\u2014or say, a novel with an ax to grind. And a fascinating subset of its \u2018thesis\u2019 is that at this late date in the Mongol expansion, in Holland\u2019s own words, their \u201clight cavalry\u201d came up against \u201cheavy.\u201d This translates into the fact that Mongols, with their bows and on their hardy ponies at last fought what we (and she), call \u201cknights,\u201d mounted on horses huge enough to bear the weight of their own armor and the cumbrous burden of their noble riders, charging at you with lowered lances. So, since such knights were essentially annihilated by the Mongols at every turn in Russia, Poland and Hungary, the \u201cWhat If?\u201d of the novel threatens also to destroy a deep and cherished European fantasy enshrined in Le Mort d\u2019Arthur\u2014and in too many other medieval texts to mention\u2014of the noble, invincible \u201cknight\u201d (errant or not). (A Google search unearths this essay of Holland\u2019s: \u2018The Death That Saved Europe: The Mongols Turn Back (2000)\u2019, anthologized in a book called\u2014What else?\u2014What If?){And Here I digress to praise Holland for portraying European knights as helpless against the Mongols, which is historical. This, in contrast to the Europhilic, knight-enabling fantasy of The Year of the Horsetails, which purports to be historic, yet inverts fact by creating a xenophobic fantasy in which knights manage to crush the dark, slant eyed, faceless Mongolian hordes.} Bottom line: Despite its transient charms, Until the Sun Falls does not do its immense subject justice. It tells too little, too late ... all for the sake of the essentially Eurocentric question: \u201cWhat if?\u201d"}, {"userName": "Edward Philippi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19388043-edward-philippi", "userReview": "A great book marred by a stupid cover.

'Until the Sun Falls' by Cecelia Holland tells the story of the General Psin and the Mongol advance through Russia to the gates of Vienna.Cecelia Holland deftly intertwines battles, political intrigue and family conflicts into a well written story. It is a very interesting narrative full of action and violence.

Jahrhundert baute ein urspr\u00fcnglich in Zentralasien beheimatetes, kleines Nomadenv\u00f6lkchen Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt eines der gr\u00f6\u00dften Weltreiche aller Zeiten auf. Durch bis dahin kaum gekannte Waffentechnologie (wie Kompositbogen) und Kriegsstrategie (leichte Kavallerie mit Ersatzpferden, strengste Disziplin und \u00fcberragende Logistik) fegten die Mongolen \u00fcber Asien und Osteuropa hinweg und hinterlie\u00dfen Schutt und Asche auf ihrem Weg. Bis heute ruft der Name Dschingis Khan sowohl Schrecken als auch Bewunderung hervor, je nachdem, auf welcher Seite man steht. In diesem historischen Roman von Altmeisterin Cecelia Holland wird nun die Geschichte der Nachfolger Dschingis Khans, insbesondere der Goldenen Horde Batu Khans und seiner Untergebenen, erz\u00e4hlt.Die Hauptperson des Romans, Psin der Merkite, ist eine Fantasiefigur, doch er ist umgeben von den realen Gener\u00e4len der Mongolen: Sabotai, Gujuk, Batu, M\u00f6ngke und viele weitere historische Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten bis hin zum Stauferk\u00f6nig Friedrich II. tauchen auf. Der historische Rahmen ist haupts\u00e4chlich durch die Feldz\u00fcge gegen die russischen St\u00e4dte wie Novgorod und Kiev gegeben. Sehr beeindruckend schildert Holland die Kraftleistung der Mongolen, im russischen Winter \u00fcber durchgefrorene Fl\u00fcsse und Schneest\u00fcrme viele St\u00e4dte zu erobern.Noch viel mehr beeindruckt war ich aber von der Beschreibung der Einstellung der Mongolen zu ihren Gegnern - ohne Gewissensbisse werden ganze St\u00e4dte ausgerottet, niedergebrannt und die wenigen \u00dcberlebenden in die Sklaverei gebracht. Der unb\u00e4ndige Kampftrieb, den Ehrgeiz, alles unter der Sonne zu erobern, und die dabei an den Tag gelegte v\u00f6llige Zivilisationsverachtung lassen den Leser stellenweise schaudern; gleichzeitig, und das ist die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Leistung der Autorin, fiebert man mit diesen tartarischen Barbaren mit, obwohl sie allen eroberten V\u00f6lkern nur Tod und Vernichtung bringen. Dabei wird hier nichts reingewaschen oder glorifiziert, im Gegenteil, manchmal erschrickt der Leser ob der K\u00fchle, mit der Psin beispielsweise befiehlt, alle Einwohner Kievs bis auf das letzte Kind zu t\u00f6ten. Auch dem Gegenextrem, der D\u00e4monisierung, f\u00e4llt Holland dabei aber nicht anheim, sondern schildert die Taten als den Ausdruck der Kultur, die ein solches Verhalten als selbstverst\u00e4ndlich und gerechtfertigt ansieht.Die Protagonisten sind sehr tief ausgearbeitet, echte Menschen mit vielen Fehlern und charakterlichen Eigenheiten, und durch ihre Handlungen und Gedanken wird viel \u00fcber das nomadische Leben der Mongolen, ihre Urspr\u00fcnge und Sitten erz\u00e4hlt, ohne das Buch zu trocken oder fachlich werden zu lassen.Das Softcoverbuch ist meines Erachtens etwas \u00fcberdimensioniert und unhandlich. Das fast quadratische Format dient nur dazu, fast ein Viertel der Seite mit Wei\u00dfraum zu f\u00fcllen. Ich bin ein gro\u00dfer Freund von Wei\u00dfraum, aber das Buch h\u00e4tte etwas handlicher werden k\u00f6nnen, h\u00e4tte man etwas davon aufgegeben. Das Papier ist gut und wei\u00df, der Druck kontrastreich. Die Einbandgestaltung bleibt mir ein R\u00e4tsel - was die rundschildbewehrten Hellenen auf einem Buch \u00fcber die Mongolen zu suchen haben, kann ich mir nicht so recht erkl\u00e4ren.Ein \u00e4u\u00dferst gelungener historischer Roman mit lebensechten Charakteren, der einem das kalte 13.

The Mongols continued on a path to world domination, secure in the belief that the world would be a better place under Mongol rule. Usually perceived as an unruly bunch of barbarous criminals, this book relates a complex set of rules for all aspects of daily life. The Yasa (rules) prescribed what a person had to do if unfortunate enough to be in a room when a woman died. The same set of rules informed the Mongols of who could kill whom and under what conditions the killing could be done. These life and death decisions were based on tribal affiliation and direct or indirect bloodlines.The authors note at the beginning of the book is usually something I always read first, as I did with this book. It is also useful to re-read it after finishing the book. There are lots of characters with pronoun referents that are not always clear. Reading the authors note again can produce a very clear picture of what was recently read and presented in a very entertaining story presentation.The book\u2019s overall surprise (not a spoiler) is the description of the very complex war machine that was the Mongol forces. Modern technology in communication between forces, subject to interference by weather and poor maintenance, is not much of an improvement on the multi-colored lanterns and codes used by the Mongols. Versatility and the ability to adapt was shown when the Mongols realized that methods and tactics used on the Steppes needed modification when employed in forests, mountains, and winter. The Mongol emphasis on assimilation rather than outright domination is presented through characters which inhabit both points of view to a greater and lesser degree. This, combined with narratives about individual accomplishments with bow and arrow, individual skills with and care of horses, and daily camp rituals make this a complex sociological study set in entertaining historical fiction novel form."}, {"userName": "Gerry Germond", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18688312-gerry-germond", "userReview": "Meet the Mongols! Your host is Psin; although actually a Merkit, the Merkits have been assimilated, Borg-like, by the Mongols and Psin is a competent and valued general. The story covers the Mongols\u2019 invasion of Russia, Hungary, and Poland and it does so from the Mongols\u2019 point of view. Doing so, the author shows us the Mongols as real human beings and not the stereotypical trolls with bows and arrows on horses. They\u2019re tender to their families (usually), have both friends and enemies in their armies, can be sarcastic (\u201cI read four short and two long, Sabotai. It may be fun to invent new signals but\u2014\u201c), friendly and just to their slaves, and conduct war as the totally violent exercise it is (cf. Wounded Knee and Hiroshima). We get a good view of how the Mongols conducted and lived on their campaigns and a glimpse of their upper-echelon leadership and politics. We see Psin and his son deal with the age-old father-son conflicts, and Psin encountering other cultures (and they him). While readers knowledgeable of history may have read how the Mongols easily defeated their foes in a paragraph\u2019s line or two, it is quite another matter reading of a battle covering a chapter. Their victories only looked easy; it took hard fighting to win them. These primarily cavalry battles are not easy to follow in the narrative. It is also not easy to keep track of the Mongol royal personages. The end of the campaign occurs in just three pages which need to be read to convey its suddenness.

Genghis Khan has just died, leaving his empire between two men: his heir to the title of high king, his son, Ogotai; and to Batu, his eldest grandson of his oldest son. As the land from the East China Sea settles for peace, the western provokes are gearing up for invasion--of Russia and whatever other lands lay west. At the heart of the story, though, is Psin, the king of a tribe that calls itself the Merkits. It is Psin who, along with his wives and family, finds himself on the brink of history. As seemingly invincible armies prepare for fierce battles along the Volga River, Russia--and in truth, all of Eastern Europe--Psin and his clan ready themselves for destiny with an enemy they never saw coming.

Here she writes a story of the Mongol invasion of Europe one generation after Genghis Kahn dies from the viewpoint of a Mongol (well, Merkit) general - and is ruthless about not supplying rationale for their behavior, with the exception of WHY the Mongols were so bent on conquest. The society is so foreign to our current way of thinking, post-colonialism, that the details are crucial to understanding enough to find empathy for these people, and Holland is a master at these details, slipping them into the narrative almost unobserved: the fraught relationship between father and son (well, THAT detail was not subtle) humanizing them, the smallness of the horses, the devotion to their wives and children, how kumiss is made, that they used saddles, their feel of the steppe.
