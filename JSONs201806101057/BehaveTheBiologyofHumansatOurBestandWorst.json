If anyone wants to watch it he did a TED talk on what makes human's unique from other animals: https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_sapo.... The book itself covers a wide range of topics, mostly centered around neurology and it's subsequent effect on behavior. The book is a little long and dense and I have finals so I shouldn't even be reading it, but I've been making time to get it done anyways. The book goes through the biology of behavior and describes what happens when we do something and how the body's various hormones and major neurotransmitters work to shape it. The book then goes into the genetic and evolutionary basis of our behavior and the ways we're predisposed to think about others specifically in groups and out groups. This topic is then expanded to talk about culture and hierarchies and our unique behavior as humans of killing over ideas. The book end with a discussion of neurology's place in law and how much culpability people actually have for their actions. There's an appendix at the end of the book for those not as familiar with neuroscience or hormones and proteins of the body. This was a really ambitious undertaking, and the book covers such a vast amount of information. I learned a lot but even with my own familiarity with a lot of the subjects it took me a while to get through this one so I'm not sure how enjoyable this will be for a more general audience. I had so many different thoughts while reading this because it brought up a lot of more pertinent issues but now I can't think of any of them for some reason. I think I'm just a little overtaken with how much I learned from the book. Sapolsky even talked about a lot of popular nonfiction books I havent gotten around to reading plus the criticisms of them and what the evidence against and for them are. It's just a lot to wrap my head around and I mean his whole point is that behavior is extremely complex and context dependent and that we don't yet understand enough to be able to predict it accurately. There are certain ways of thinking that we are predisposed towards but nothing is a hundred percent certain yet. I love neurology and the brain and so this is my type of books so of course I enjoyed it immensely,I'm not sure how much anyone else would like it. He did a very thorough job going through the current literature and covering much of what is being talked about in the present which a lot of nonfiction books tend not to do. I learned a lot and I really think I need to read more of Sapolsky's books."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "This is an outstanding and monumental synthesis on the causes of behavior by a talented researcher and teacher. He excels in making the science of the brain and behavior accessible to a wide audience without oversimplification. The goal is to provide a handle on how to account for the origins of the most admirable and most despicable of human actions, i.e. the roots of empathy and altruism on the one hand and violence, war, and genocide on the other. Sapolsky\u2019s accomplishment yields an expansion of what we mean by the biological basis of behavior, enough knowledge of brain systems to make you dangerous, and a better appreciation of the interplay between cognitive and emotional contributions to our actions. You will come away with a better appreciation of human evolution, an informed perspective on whether our hunter-gatherer ancestors were more aligned with a Hobbesian dog-eat-dog character or of an Edenic Rousseau types. In the end, he mounts an assault on the need for a concept of free will, arguing that it is equivalent to putting a homunculus in the driver\u2019s seat above the material universe. His mantra is for a multifactorial and hierarchical array of causes behind behavior. In the end it will be easy to conclude that the extreme complexity of the brain limits the gains in explanatory power from any simplistic reductionist plan. I this vein, I liked the quote from Hilary Bok:The claim that a person chose her action does not conflict with the claim that some neural processes or state caused it; it simply redescribes it.Sapolsky\u2019s organizing principle of serving up mountains of research progress according to different timescales that precede particular behaviors is a very helpful approach. Looking at events a second before a behavior taps into automated and unconscious processes in the brain; seconds before brings in higher neural systems associated with conscious actions; hours to days before is the realm of hormonal influences; days to months before the impact of things like chronic stress and adaptations of neuroplasticity; years and decades before includes the shaping of culture and individual development; and centuries to millennia before the processes of evolution. You\u2019ll be busting at the seams by the time you get through this program. He is so skilled at introducing humor and commonsense translations to the concepts presented you will be amazed in your ability to follow his presentation and never fall asleep. If some of the presentation doesn\u2019t quite sink in, he excels in summary take-home messages at the end of each chapter and provision of frequent links among the chapters. A big plus for me was his overall humility and restraint in claiming more than is reasonably warranted from the data. He is scathing for the excessive claims such as of genetic causes of bad behavior (e.g. calling a variant of a monoamine oxidase gene that provides limited predictability for violent behavior a \u201cwarrior gene\u201d), use of premenstrual syndrome as a claim of diminished responsibility in a court defense, and the puffing up of the evidence about \u201cmirror neurons\u201d, which are active both when a primate acts and observes the same act in another, as the foundation of empathy and altruism. The stupendous advances from being able to assess activity of significant brain structures in humans through functional magnetic resonance imaging are also subject to overinterpretation, which I think he mostly avoids. I liked his outrage that the problem of PTSD depended on brain scans showing shrinkage of the hippocampus to get Congress to recognize the problem as worthy of expanding treatment resources. For me, I was more impressed by the power of images of changed receptors in the meth addict\u2019s brain to justify more funding of substance abuse treatment as a \u201cbrain\u201d disease. The principle is the same: these people need help in the social and psychological realm, and using images as a reification of their state doesn\u2019t really change the situation. That said, I was disappointed with his simplistic summary that schizophrenia is a \u201cbiochemical disorder\u201d and dyslexia a result of \u201cmicroscopic cortical malformations\u201d. The interdisciplinary nature of the topics here raises the issue of reliability of the presenter in interpreting the research. I appreciate how the author has a solid track record both in field studies of dominance and aggression in baboons and in laboratory studies on hormonal and brain system roles in social behaviors. Having been a researcher in the area of brain mechanisms of aggression and motivational systems for several years, I can testify to the veracity and wisdom of his analyses of brain studies. As my former scientific career ended up mostly in the area of brain development and plasticity, I can say he was inaccurate on the status of research on a couple of subjects (e.g. the claim of long distance sprouting of new connections to account for repurposing of the visual cortex in blind people; the conclusion that the extensive neuron cell death during development serves primarily an error-correction function).Can the average reader handle and dig all the brain talk in this book? I think the author does a great job keeping the jargon down in the narrative and slipping a lot of the details into copious footnotes, providing a primer on basic neuroscience in an appendix, and justifying significant points with a huge collection of references stored in the back. A couple of areas of the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the dopamine reinforcement system get the starring role in most of the studies discussed. As an example, here is a bit on the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex: The dlPFC is the decider of deciders, the most rational, cognitive, utilitarian, unsentimental part of the PFC. \u2026In contrast to the dlPFC, there\u2019s the ventral part of the PFC, particularly the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC). \u2026This is ..an honorary member of the limbic system because of its interconnections with it. Logically, the vmPFC is all about the impact of emotion on decision making. And many of our best and worst behaviors involve interactions of the vmPFC with the limbic system and the dlPFC.\u2026Consider a classic moral quandary\u2014is it okay to kill one innocent person to save five? When people ponder the question, greater dlPFC activation predicts a greater likelihood of answering yes.\u2026In this bit on dopamine, I give you a taste of his humor:Though the dopamine system is similar across numerous species, humans do something utterly novel: we delay gratification for insanely long times. No warthog restricts calories to look good in a bathing suit next summer. No gerbil works hard at school to get good SAT scores to get into a good college to get into a good grad school to get a good job to get into a good nursing home.Here is a sample on the amygdala, long linked to a major role in fear and anxiety:Amygdalae are prepared to learn to associate something bad with Them.So if whites see a black face shown at a subliminal speed, the amygdala activates. But if the face is shown long enough for conscious processing, and anterior cingulate cortex and the \u201ccognitive\u201d dlPFC then activate and inhibit the amygdala. \u2026This is so depressing\u2014are we hardwired to fear the face of someone from another race, to process their face less as a face, to feel less empathy? No. For starters there\u2019s tremendous individual variation \u2026Moreover, subtle manipulations rapidly change the amygdaloid response to the face of an Other.Here is a good example of his humility in the face of the brains complexity:A \u201cneurobiological\u201d or \u201cgenetic\u201d or \u201cdevelopmental\u201d explanation for a behavior is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective.Pretty impressive, huh? Actually, maybe not. Maybe I\u2019m just pretentiously saying, \u201cYou have to think complexly about complex things.\u201d Wow, what a revelation. And maybe what I\u2019ve been tacitly setting up is this full-of-ourselves straw man of \u201cOooh, we\u2019re going to think subtly. We won\u2019t get suckered into simplistic answers, not like those chickencrossing-the-road neurochemists and chicken evolutionary biologists and chicken psychoanalysts., all living in their own limited categorical buckets.\u201dSapolsky shines in his overview on the roles of testosterone on aggression, of oxytocin on empathy and prosocial behavior, and of stress on both realms of behavior. I liked his conclusion that no drug or hormone or gene can be said to cause a behavior. And all we know of a person\u2019s state of brain health, genetic background, and experience does not provide a reliable predictor of bad or good behavior. At a critical point Sapolsky illustrates the importance of a multifactorial outlook by considering whether a particular woman will suffer from depression. Having a certain variant of the serotonin transporter gene has at most a 10% predictive power. But adding development in poverty, experience of child abuse, levels of glucocorticoids in the bloodstream, living in a collectivist culture, and menstrual status might bring you up get you up to a 50% level of prediction. This illustrates both progress in understanding the causes of behavior and the limitations of such knowledge. The author hits a popular vein in his chapter on adolescence. The late maturation of the prefrontal cortex and its function to in reigning in excessive emotionality or impulsive behaviors is held to represent a biological foundation for the folly of youth. I\u2019m not sure what benefits we get in how to treat teenagers wisely with this knowledge over the standard psychological consideration of them as being immature. We are not far from McLean\u2019s model of the Triune Brain, with the neocortex in primates an evolutionary wonder that is seen as riding herd on the unruly mammalian limbic system and lizard-brain of the brainstem like Freud\u2019s Superego over the Id. And emphasizing to parents and teachers the risks of teens\u2019 late development of executive brain functions practically puts them in the category of the brain-damaged. Still, it was fun to experience how eloquent Sapolsky gets on the subject:If by adolescence limbic, autonomic, and endocrine systems are going full blast, while the frontal cortex is still working out the assembly instructions, we\u2019ve just explained why adolescents are so frustrating, great, asinine, impulsive, inspiring, destructive, self-destructive, selfless, selfish, impossible, and world-changing.Where it comes to egregious acts of violence or crime, neuroscience provides little new ground for or against excusing someone\u2019s responsibility for their acts on the basis of biological causes not in the person\u2019s control. Still, an essential role of the criminal justice system is to \u201cprotect the endangered from the dangerous\u201d. And despite any solid way to predict dangerousness, juries need to consider diminished capacities for judgment among the accused. Knowledge about the delayed maturation of frontal cortical systems in adolescents helps to justify being more lenient on them in the justice system. The philosopher Stephen Pinker and neuroscientist Michael Gazzanaga both lean with Sapolsky toward the concept that free will is an illusion, but they still argue we must hold people responsible to varying degrees for violent criminal acts. The argument that a man can\u2019t help being a pedophile but is responsible for acts of child abuse is compelling. But Sapolsky holds his ground that the latter acts are biologically determined no less than the ingrained proclivity to fixate on children and to think otherwise reflects an unscientific dualism of an ethereal homunculus pulling the strings. He doesn\u2019t have a practical answer for reforming the criminal justice system, though he did launch an ongoing discussion between a group of jurists and social scientists and a set of neuroscientists starting with a workshop. One can expect further encroachment of neuroscience into the courtroom, which Sapolsky hopes will proceed with great caution:Perhaps we\u2019ll have to settle for making sure our homuncular myths are benign and save the heavy lifting of truly thinking rationally for what matters\u2014when we judge others harshly.Hopefully, the new science of unconscious biases among juries and judges can also be applied to help mitigate some of the excess manipulations of the prosecutors and defense lawyers. For example, research showing that sentences rendered by judges tend to be more severe when they are hungry (i.e. right before lunch). And all members of society (and jury members) must somehow be on guard for subterranean perceptions like the following:From an early age, in both sexes and across cultures, attractive people are judged to be smarter, kinder, and more honest. We\u2019re more likely to vote for attractive people or hire them, less likely to convict them of crimes, more likely to dole out shorter sentences. Remarkably, the medial orbitofrontal cortex assesses both the beauty of a face and the goodness of a behavior, and its level on one of those tasks predicts the level during the other. The brain does similar things when contemplating beautiful minds, hearts, and cheekbones. And assumes that cheekbones tell something about minds and hearts.This is a long book, but I wished the author would have spent more time on the nature of war from a biological perspective. I don\u2019t believe he ever broached the subject of territorial aggression, which represents one of the major classes of intraspecies violence found among many species and some primates and the form that most closely resembles human group conflicts that involve killing people over turf. Maybe the outrageous claims of a territorial instinct behind human war by the likes of Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey nearly 40 years ago still make this a disreputable topic for current scientists to pursue. The discovery that groups of chimps sometimes coordinate together on patrols and raids into another chimp community and kill members they encounter was a shock to many who imbibed Jane Goodall\u2019s portrait of their communities, and obvious analogies to human war were made in the media. Usually territorial conflicts in animals are resolved through symbolic displays that provoke a withdrawal by the intruders of another groups\u2019 territory. The professor I worked with on a brain region that appeared to organize the freeze-flight-fight system in rats in the early 70\u2019s, David Adams, went on to lead efforts that emphasized that the technology and weapons humans use in group conflicts in the historical period makes war a different kettle of fish from animal territorial aggression because the distances over which the weapons operate preclude use of the usual behavioral signals that moderate lethal outcomes. As part of his work for UNESCO he helped facilitate the drafting of the Seville Statement on Violence in 1986, a proclamation signed by 20 prominent scientists that aimed \u201cto dispel the widespread belief that human beings are inevitably disposed to war as a result of innate, biologically determined aggressive traits\u201d (see http://www.culture-of-peace.info/). A lot of the debate about biological foundations of lethal violence in humans centers around studies of contemporary hunter-gatherer societies and anthropological evidence from ancient human remains. Popular books by people like Jared Diamond and Stephen Pinker interpret such data to indicate that prehistoric humans were always perpetrators of war. Sapolsky spends significant time on the criticisms from various sources on the veracity of the data from hunter-gatherer societies and argues that the advent of agriculture and fixed settlements made warfare more deadly because conflict resolution by moving to a new territory became a less feasible option. The thesis in Pinker\u2019s recent book, \u201cBetter Angels of Our Nature\u201d, that the death rate from war has declined substantially over the historical period does not really figure into considerations of the prehistoric hunter-gatherer origins of our species. Nevertheless, Sapolsky criticizes his use of data on death estimates from some historical genocidal events without taking into account their long duration (e.g. centuries for the black slave trade and colonial annihilation of Native Americans). After taking duration as well as population density into account, wars and genocides of the 20th century account for half of the top 10 events of megadeath from violence in known history (surprisingly the Rwandan genocide makes the list under this framework due to its 700K deaths over only 100 days).Much food for thought can be found in this important book. If you want to learn a bit more about Sapolsky the man and his fascinating field work on baboons, I highly recommend his A Primate\u2019s Memoir: A Neuroscientist's Unconventional Life Among the Baboons .

This was a whirlwind, a high-speed ride, exercising my amygdala mightily. No book I\u2019ve read, at least this year, has challenged me the way this one has. And not just the science, which I will largely forget in its details soon enough. More so, the intellectual challenge was in questioning almost everything I believe. Why do we behave the way we do? You\u2019ll get no biology primer from me. Let\u2019s plunge right in:In the fall of 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, and in the run-up to the Gulf War, Americans were sickened by a story that emerged. On October 10, 1990, a fifteen-year-old refugee from Kuwait appeared before a congressional Human Rights Caucus.The girl\u2014she would only give her first name, Nayirah\u2014had volunteered in a hospital in Kuwait City. She tearfully testified that Iraqi soldiers had stolen incubators to ship home as plunder, leaving over three-hundred premature infants to die.Our collective breath was taken away. . . . The testimony was seen on the news by approximately 45 million Americans, was cited by seven senators when justifying their support of war (a resolution that passed by five votes), and was cited more than ten times by George H. W. Bush in arguing for U.S. military involvement. And we went to war with a 92 percent approval rating of the president\u2019s decision. In the words of Representative John Porter (R-Illinois), who chaired the committee . . . , \u201cwe have never heard, in all this time, in all circumstances, a record of inhumanity, and brutality, and sadism, as the ones that [Nayirah had] given us today.\u201dMuch later it emerged that the incubator story was a pseudospeciating lie. The refugee was no refugee. She was Nayirah al-Sabah, the fifteen-year-old daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. The incubator story was fabricated by the public relations firm Hill + Knowlton, hired by the Kuwaiti government with the help of Porter and cochair Representative Tom Lantos (D-California). Research by the firm indicated that people would be particularly responsive to stories about atrocities against babies (ya think?), so the incubator story was concocted, the witness coached. The story was disavowed by human rights groups . . . and the media, and the testimony was withdrawn from the Congressional Record\u2014long after the war.Be careful when our enemies are made to remind us of maggots and cancer and shit. But also beware when it is our empathic intuitions, rather than hateful ones, that are manipulated by those who use us for their own goals.----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----In the 1990s crime rates plummeted nationwide. Liberals cited the thriving economy. Conservatives credited policing, expanded prisons, and three-strike sentencing laws. Neither, says, our author. Demographics showed that crime rates dropped in areas where abortions became legally, readily available. This was highly controversial, but it makes perfect, depressing sense to me, our author writes. What majorly predicts a life of crime? Being born to a mother who, if she could, would have chosen that you not be.----- ----- ----- ----- -----Drone pilots, who sit somewhere far-removed from battle, but can blow up a group of men sitting around a campfire just by pushing a button, and watch the whole thing (you know, body parts) on their computer screen, have the same rate of Post-Traumatic Stress as soldiers in the field.----- ----- ----- ----- -----. . . in a study of more than 1,100 judicial rulings, prisoners were granted parole at about a 60 percent rate when judges had recently eaten, and at essentially a 0 percent rate just before judges ate. . . . Justice may be blind, but she\u2019s sure sensitive to her stomach gurgling.----- ----- ----- ----- -----Okay, enough examples from the book; I\u2019ll spare you the pages and pages of notes. I read this book because Sapolsky\u2019s book  A Primate\u2019s Memoir is an all-time favorite. And this is his life work, here. He didn\u2019t lose me with the long biology lesson at the beginning of the book. Indeed, he sorta said just read through this, enough will stick to understand what follows. But then he resorted to, essentially, sociological surveys to support his positions. Academic things. I\u2019ve been on the answering end of such surveys and understand just how pre-ordained and un-scientific they can be. And, as smart as he is (very, and much smarter than me) he doesn\u2019t get that sometimes when he was talking about bias, he kind of exposed his own biases. He repeatedly confessed to being a Liberal, then stated as scientific fact that Liberals are more intelligent than Conservatives. Which brings up another point. Before plunging into a discussion of Politics, he notes that there are lot of hands raised in that terrain between Liberal and Conservative. My rough guess is that perhaps a majority of people join me in that middle ground. But Sapolsky says, never mind, let\u2019s just consider Liberals and Conservatives. Well, no you can\u2019t; and even if you could, it sure as hell wouldn\u2019t be science. And, oh, he\u2019s glib, with repeated stay tuned and all that is cool, but. . .; and he even reduces himself to making fun of someone\u2019s name.So, yes, some things he wrote got my amygdala all agitated. But then my frontal cortex took over, which I now know it will do, and let me analyze what he is saying as objectively as I could.We are learning more from science every day. Like, that that frontal cortex (the decider) isn\u2019t fully online until our twenties. So what responsibility does a 14-year-old murderer own? We once burned epileptics as witches, owned slaves, and thought those acts appropriate, justified, biblically-sanctioned. Now we wonder how we could have done that. What will we think of how we behave now in 100 years, 500 years?Notwithstanding some annoyances, which I stated above, this really is a remarkable book and highly recommended by me. It takes a while and is not easy in spots. Maybe first check out some lectures by Sapolsky, readily available on YouTube. You will get a sense of his depth, humor and manic energy, all of which fuel this book. Here\u2019s one about the topic in question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0Oa4... and here\u2019s one on how religion is a mental illness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJM5m... .This book changed me, of that I\u2019m sure. Imagine that. Now, excuse me, I have to do some chipmunk experiments."}, {"userName": "Morgan Blackledge", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge", "userReview": "Sapolsky is my lord.

In this work, he surveys the literature on Brains, Genetics, Culture, and puts together a detailed picture of what makes us tick. He takes in a large chunk of the human condition and lays out much of the known science around it. Be it gender, race, politics, development, violence of all sorts, personality, deviance and conformity, Social Dominance and Authoritarianism, Hierarchy, Ethnicity, differences between liberals and conservatives, Sexuality. Sapolsky is encyclopedic in his study of humans and their behaviors and thoughts and down to earth in his presentation. Reminds of Pinker in the presentation. A good scientist and a good writer.5/12/2018 On the second reading of Sapolsky's book I come away with a better idea of how his picture hangs together. The format, in general, is to look at proximal causes of our behavior starting with immediate causes like the firing of neurons and progressively going farther back in time to cover causes more distant from the present. Sapolsky goes from stuff in our neurons and brains that happened a few seconds or minutes ago, to things like hormones and endocrine stuff that could have bubbled up in the last few hours or days, to frontal cortex development in adolescence and the environment, back to the early childhood and the womb, to the genes and zygote, to culture of the past few decades, centuries and millennia, to our deep evolutionary past. At each of these levels, a part of our ordinary and extraordinary behavior is sculpted. This complex and layered picture starts to do justice to our extraordinary species and its multifaceted behavior. Much more than most pop explanations which focus on one aspect only of this long time sequence. Sapolsky covers much material and ranges widely but ultimately comes back to practical issues, like human development, war and peace, violence, stress and solving problems very serious problems we as people face. recommended."}, {"userName": "Atila Iamarino", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5648532-atila-iamarino", "userReview": "Um dos melhores livros que j\u00e1 li, tranquilamente.

What we do and how we act is related to our biology..all of it\u2026like neurobiology, endocrinology, genetics, the relevance of which he attempts to be very careful and specific about explaining. He goes back in time, bringing in examples from our ancient history to show how things have changed and how culturally conditioned our reactions and responses are to stimuli. Each chapter ends with a summary, and the book ends with insights he has developed over years of study. Skim these to see if there is something more you wish to pursue. The studies he discusses in each section are referenced by authors focusing on different aspects of human knowledge and you may already be familiar with them. The concepts explored underpin much of what we understand about human behavior and morality. The work of Steven Pinker, cognitive scientist and currently professor of psychology at Harvard, is described by Sapolsky as \u201cmonumental\u201d and is given its own critique late in this book.Sapolsky is not arrogant. He writes this book not to show off his knowledge, but to share his knowledge, which is why he tries to make it as readable as possible without dumbing it down. It is a work to be grateful for. One of the more moving moments in the work comes near the end, after over 600 pages of science and Sapolsky is talking about doing the right thing. He introduces us to Anglican cleric John Newton, born in 1725.Newton composed the hymn \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d but that is not what Sapolsky wants to tell us. Newton is remembered as an abolitionist, mentor to William Wilberforce who worked through parliament to outlaw slavery in the British Isles. But he didn\u2019t start out that way. Read the story for yourself--plan to read the whole back-end of the book because you won\u2019t be able to stop with Newton\u2014about individuals, ordinary individuals making a difference and doing the right thing.Sapolsky may be a great scientist, but he is great writer and a great teacher. He makes us think and challenge our own assumptions. He tries to answer questions as they arise and he does not intentionally obfuscate. He does not dodge and only occasionally dismisses, and only then when an argument falls of its own weight. If you wish you had the background to soak up everything he says but do not, go for one of his earlier books which he wrote as a younger man, less burdened by all he has studied. They display his trademark intelligence and humor and are as much fun as a barrel of monkeys book on bonobos."}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max", "userReview": "Sapolsky explores the causes of human behavior at every level. Although he throws in some zingers and catchy vernacular, this is a serious work that can read like a textbook. He divides the book in two parts. The first deals with everything that affects behavior: The brain, neurons, neurotransmitters, hormones; environmental factors particularly in adolescence, childhood, and the womb; culture, genes and epigenetics. The second half shows how all these factors combine to affect us as individuals and as a society. We are presented with an intricate array of influences and as often is the case, the more you know, the less clarity you have about what it all means.In a particularly dense beginning (with appendices for the underlying science) we get primers on the brain and neurons, their structure and how they work. We see how the interplay of their many component parts modulates behavior leading to impulsiveness or restraint. In addition we learn how we are influenced by the way we produce and process neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin) and of course hormones (testosterone, oxytocin). Sapolsky shows that the effects of these chemicals are not as straightforward as commonly presented. For example, oxytocin, the widely heralded pair-bonding hormone, causes us to draw closer to family but also to be more distant to strangers, in effect, amplifying the \u201cUs Versus Them\u201d syndrome.Sapolsky discusses a variety of factors that affect brain, emotional and cognitive development. He points out that the child facing poverty or abuse, lack of maternal interest or care, or lack of stimulation in the environment will be severely compromised. He focuses on adolescence. This awkward age is characterized by a fully developed limbic system which fosters emotions and a far from developed frontal cortex which supports reason. We all have witnessed the result. And of course there are genes which greatly affect behavior, but in context. Environmental effects shaping genes begin in the womb and continue through childhood. Epigenetic factors turn genes on or off. When genes are expressed their impact varies based on the other genes in play and the specific circumstances. For example the extensively studied 7R variant of the DRD4 gene makes you more generous than average if you grew up in a secure environment and less generous than average if you grew up in an insecure one. Sapolsky highlights other genes that cut both ways depending on environment.But much more than brain structure, neurons, neurotransmitters, hormones and genes determine behavior. Our decisions and actions, often unconsciously, are affected by unrelated events occurring at the same time. People holding a cold glass of water in one hand will view others as colder than they otherwise would. If a reviewer reads your resume attached to a heavy clipboard, you are more likely to be judged more serious than others whose resumes are read on light clipboards. Subliminal images also impact our conscious perceptions. Sapolsky offers many examples of how our behavior is primed by sensorial input that does not enter our consciousness. Cultural context is also important. What we expect to see affects what we will. This underlies much of the racism that is so divisive. Culture affects how we process what we see. Sapolsky points to the different ways people in collectivist cultures (East Asian) and individualist cultures (Western) focus their vision. Take a landscape photo with a person in the center. Someone from China will likely focus on the background as much or more than the person, an American just the reverse. Chinese immigrants to the US will take a generation to adopt the US priority in focusing on images. How much of our behavior with respect to violence is due to human nature? Were prehistoric hunter gatherer societies more or less violent or warlike than we are today? Sapolsky reviews expert opinions on both sides of the argument. What a contrast between his excellent presentation of this issue and Harari\u2019s one-sided presentation in Sapiens. We learn that experts disagree. However Sapolsky still echoes Harari, calling the agricultural revolution \u201cone of the all-time human blunders\u201d. I don\u2019t understand this. Without the agricultural revolution Sapolsky would be digging roots or chasing antelopes if he was lucky enough to have ever been born. Instead he is exploring the depths of the human mind, increasing our understanding of who we are. No matter how idyllic you paint primitive existence, I could not value it over one where we can develop our minds and build a better future for our children, as hard as that may be.In the second half of the book Sapolsky explores how all the forces that impact human behavior come together to influence the way we see each other and the world. He starts with a quote attributed to Robert Benchley, \u201cThere are two kinds of people in the world: those who divide the world into two kinds of people and those who don\u2019t.\u201d Sapolsky\u2019s ensuing discussion of \u201cUs Versus Them\u201d is amazingly relevant to the current political dialogue in the U.S. Our political proclivity to be liberal or conservative is 50% heritable. Each position embodies a larger set of beliefs. Conservatives most highly value loyalty, authority and sanctity while liberals most highly value care, fairness and liberty. One study gave another reason why our political choices are less than rational. Groups of five-year-olds were asked to choose a captain for a boat ride to Candyland. Each group was asked to decide between pictures of two candidates. The pictures were from political contests across the US. The kids\u2019 pick was the winner of the political contest 71% of the time.How are moral choices made? Of course Sapolsky cites myriad influences. Particularly interesting is empathy. We tend to conflate this with compassion, but empathy often is an end in itself and precludes a compassionate act. Sapolsky points out that empathy may have evolved to help us learn. It\u2019s one thing to learn first-hand that a hot iron burns, seeing what happens to someone else touching the iron is a better way to learn and the lessen is strongly reinforced if we actually feel the other person\u2019s pain. This is probably why that part of the brain (anterior cingulate cortex) that processes empathy developed. Interestingly most people who perform heroic selfless acts don\u2019t think or feel anything first, they act instantaneously. Is there free will? Endlessly arguable, but if there is it certainly seems relegated to the back seat. Sapolsky explores what this implies for the American legal justice system. He believes we should abolish it in its present form. This doesn\u2019t mean he thinks criminals should run free, but justice as punishment for an evil act makes no more sense than punishing an unreliable car. For everyone\u2019s protection unsafe cars and dangerous criminals shouldn\u2019t be allowed on the streets. Deterrence and public safety are legitimate reasons to lock people up, but not retribution. Capital punishment is clearly wrong.Are times more peaceful than in the past? Sapolsky references Steven Pinker\u2019s Better Angels of Our Nature, which now I will have to read. Perhaps violence is down as a percentage of population. In that respect one could say modern wars kill fewer people than ancient ones. However modern wars kill people faster. WWII killed 55 million people and at a faster rate than past major wars. Modern 21st century weapons are poised to kill us all in a flash. Are we at a lesser chance of war? Harari in Sapiens thinks so given the lack of a world war since the 1940\u2019s. I\u2019m reminded of Max Hastings in Catastrophe 1914 quoting an 80 year old Brit just before WWI. He assured his interviewer that there wouldn\u2019t be a major war since in his experience these things always worked themselves out. Unfortunately his experience wasn\u2019t quite long enough. Religion has been responsible for countless wars and still underlies much of the conflict today. Sapolsky brings up a quote I loved regarding religious wars. \u201cPeople are fighting over who has the better imaginary friend.\u201d attributed to Napoleon. Sadly, nationalistic populism is on the rise often citing religious values and demonizing \u201cThem.\u201d All in all this is a great book if somewhat depressing. How much do we really control our own actions? The influences on human behavior are so many, so intertwined, and so complex that making sense of it seems almost hopeless. Still there are important lessons we can learn just understanding that fact. We can forego the presumptiveness of intuitively knowing why people behave the way they do. We can see that just casting blame and calling others evil will get us nowhere. Sapolsky gives us a detailed and thoughtful mix of facts and his opinions, of which I have covered small slices. It is not a light read, but if you want to understand why we do the things we do, it is very worthwhile."}, {"userName": "Dan Graser", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser", "userReview": "Wow. This is brilliant, mind-clearing work by Stanford Professor and MacArthur \"genius\" Fellow Robert Sapolsky. Not only does he present the latest data in fields of neuroscience and psychology, but his presentation of several issues of human behavior from the levels of neurobiology, sensory and stimulus perception, changes in hormone levels, developmental changes in physiology, evolutionary changes over the course of millions of years, as well as cultural and psychological changes from the environment as well as parental/societal upbringing makes for the most thorough, multidisciplinary work I've ever read. All the while, over the course of around 700 pages that is, Sapolsky does so in very readable and at times quite bizarrely funny fashion:\"It floats above the limbic system, supporting philosophers since at least Descartes who have emphasized the dichotomy between thought and emotion. Of course, that's all wrong, as shown by the temperature of a cup - something processed in the hypothalamus - altering assessment of of the coldness of someone's personality.\"\"...after all, LTP (long-term potentiation) is what occurred in Schopenhauer's hippocampus when he read Hegel, not what the spinal cord does to make you more coordinated at twerking.\"\"Agriculture's invention is one of the all-time human blunders, up thee with, say, the New Coke debacle and the Edsel...and from there it's just a hop, skip, and a jump until we've got Mr. McGregor persecuting Peter Rabbit and people incessantly singing Oklahoma.\"Quoting Steve Jones: \"Evolution is to analogy as statues are to birdshit.\"He ends each chapter with important bullet points and makes this very complicated work flow seamlessly. As he approaches the great moral topics of the day the writing becomes quite poignant as demonstrated in two powerful back-to-back chapters, \"Metaphors We Kill By,\" and \"Biology, the Criminal Justice System, and Free Will.\"I can't recommend this enough, rarely is this much education so much fun to read!"}, {"userName": "Darian Onaciu", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12885473-darian-onaciu", "userReview": "Drop whatever you have on your reading queue and READ THIS BOOK NOW!The authorWhenever I read a non-fiction book I always look up the author: who he is, what achievements he has and which are the tools he uses to understand and explain bits of reality. I think it is important to do this in order to have a better grasp on the accuracy of his claims. \"Robert Morris Sapolsky is an American neuroendocrinologist and author. He is currently a professor of biology, and professor of neurology and neurological sciences and, by courtesy, neurosurgery, at Stanford University.\"The bookThis is the best book on behavior, so on humans in general, and the overall best book I have *read so far.Make no mistake - this is a tough read but by no means because of the author's fault or its length.The endeavor he embarked on - explaining human behavior from every conceivable facet - is one of such magnitude that its sheer complexity demands you understand the underlying workings of neuroscience and endocrinology. Fear not however, as he takes you step by step with detailed explanations through all of these and more, laying the building blocks towards a better understanding of yourself and others.I am a long time admirer of science because it is the only tool that helps us better understand ourselves and the environment, facilitating a better comprehension of reality and the Universe we live in.Sapolsky uses the latest research interwoven with great examples, so that you can better grasp the complexity, all told through his strikingly objective thinking sprinkled with great humor.He tackles mind-numbingly complex subjects such as social hierarchies, morality, killing, war, peace, religion and free will, all while taking into account the environment, early stage fetal development, human evolution and so many other factors that your head might start to hurt, looking at behavior through each of these lenses.It is difficult for me to express in this measly review just how amazing his effort is.More amazing however is that he pulls it off, making this the most awesome endeavor about understanding humans that I am aware of.Sapolsky is a FUCKING LEGEND!Just as Morgan Blackledge, a GoodReads reviewer (sorry I can't seem to tag you here) says:\"You're not fully sentient until you have watched all 20+ hours of his lectures from the course (at least once) which are freely available on YouTube.\"If you don't like to read - although I highly doubt you're here if that's the case -  go watch his YouTube videos.Better yet, read the damned book AND watch his videos - you can thank me later!All these taken into consideration, I am convinced that \nEVERYONE\nshould read this book.Notes*I listened to the book - so used an audiobook format - and I absolutely do not recommend you do this unless you are familiar with the intricacies of neuroscience or, as I will do, you will purchase a written copy to go again through the content.**There are people who celebrate the lack of science behind their actions and you should be weary of them.One such example I've recently seen is a man who claims he is a certified psychotherapist, which I don't necessarily doubt, but openly acknowledged, when I asked, that there is no science behind his therapy. I expected the workshop participants to raise and leave the room, however they only applauded onward as he charismatically spinned the story to his liking.Please educate yourself, use critical thinking and always be skeptical in order not to be fooled and robbed by the likes of them - science is not perfect, however it is undoubtedly better than falling into the traps of cheap generalizations, confirmation biases and short term placebo effects.Reality is very complex so we should acknowledge this and act accordingly.***If you'd like recommendations on books I consider to be good in this area, feel free to ask or just take a look at my 'read' list.****I'm starting to seriously think there should be modern means to teach people how to think and the emergence of Mixed Reality might be a good medium for that.

It is a book about the ways in which humans harm one another. But it is also a book about the ways in which people do the opposite. What does biology teach us about cooperation, affiliation, reconciliation, empathy, and altruism?\nBehave took me longer than average to read \u2013 at a rate of about 30 pages/hour, this was approximately a twenty-five hour commitment for me \u2013 and while some of that reflects the care I took to understand the well-explained but still complex neurobiology behind human behaviour, nothing about this book encourages the reader to skim or gloss over: everything is just so interesting and I went slowly in an effort to absorb as much as possible. I can't ask for more from a book. Author Robert M. Sapolsky must be an inspirational professor to study under at Stanford, and in addition to his clear explanations of the sciencey bits, this book is full of (mostly bad) jokes, personal anecdotes, and illustrative examples that keeps everything relatable and focussed; Behave feels like a magnum opus, the synthesis of all that Sapolsky has learned over his professional and personal life, and to that end, I think it's valuable to let Sapolsky explain himself and his intent here:I make my living as a combination neurobiologist \u2013 someone who studies the brain \u2013 and primatologist \u2013 someone who studies monkeys and apes. Therefore, this is a book that is rooted in science, specifically biology. And out of that come three key points: First, you can't begin to understand things like aggression, competition, cooperation, and empathy without biology; I say this for the benefit of a certain breed of social scientist who finds biology to be irrelevant and a bit ideologically suspect when thinking about human social behavior. But just as important, second, you're just as much up the creek if you rely only on biology; this is said for the benefit of a certain style of molecular fundamentalist who believes that the social sciences are destined to be consumed by \u201creal\u201d science. And a third point, by the time you finish this book, you'll see that it actually makes no sense to distinguish between aspects of a behavior that are \u201cbiological\u201d and those that would be describes as, say, \u201cpsychological\u201d or \u201ccultural\u201d. Utterly intertwined.I wish I could find the quote now, but I once read something like, \u201cAmerican high school students learn that their Civil War was about slavery, but if they go to college, they'll soon learn that it was fought over taxation, State Rights, etc. However, anyone who studies further and learns the intricacies and nuances of history will discover that the Civil War was fought over...slavery (just not in the simplistic way that a high school student might believe).\u201d Sapolsky follows the same kind of dialectic arc in his explanation of human behaviour. In the first sections, he describes the neural processes (the gooey brain stuff) that immediately precede any action: Fear triggers the amygdala, and in a split second choice between fight or flight, you punch an approaching stranger in the face; you are a slave to your biology. In the next sections, Sapolsky expands the neural picture to include all of the environmental factors that set individuals up to choose, for example, between fight and flight (ie., the so-called \u201cwarrior gene\u201d in aggressive adults needs to be activated by a lousy childhood); proving that we are not slaves to our biology; there are a multitude of factors that influence behaviour; we have the free will (or the \u201cfree won't\u201d) to choose amongst options, and that punch is an individual choice. Sapolsky then goes on to expand the picture further \u2013 to include the historical, cultural, and familial factors that inform behaviour \u2013 and as we can't control how we have been conditioned to behave, we are each enslaved by our conditioned biology. (Sapolsky rejects the notion that \u201cno one can choose not to be a pedophile but pedophiles can choose not to be child molesters\u201d: just as we are justifiably horrified by a society that once condemned epileptics as witches when they had seizures, Sapolsky imagines a more knowledgeable future in which we have mapped the brain to the extent that a child molester's desires can be cured; until that day, we are the equivalent of the Spanish Inquisition in our bloodlust for punishing these sex offenders for an uncontrollable brain disease. As a final aside on this, Sapolsky does agree that child molesters need to be separated from society, but doesn't see the efficacy of \u201cpunishment\u201d and is looking forward to a more enlightened future.) The final sections explain how, in general, our society has been evolving towards less aggression, and as the state of the world literally moulds the state of our brains, we should all be working towards a more peaceful society that will, in turn, evolve more peace-seeking brains.The biology of the behaviors that interest us is, in all cases, multifactorial \u2013 that is the thesis of this book.As I started with, Behave reads like the synthesis of what Sapolsky has learned in both his professional and personal life, and his personal beliefs were never far from the surface here (which will cost him a star in my estimation; this book is not purely about the science). He refers to himself as a \u201cprogressive\u201d, a \u201cclich\u00e9d card-carrying liberal\u201d, and cites studies that apparently show liberals to be more morally evolved than conservatives (conservatives are apparently more enslaved to fear-based triggers to their amygdalas; liberals take the time to sift kneejerk reactions through their more prudent prefrontal cortexes), but I don't know how, if we are all slaves to our biology, one belief system can be more \u201cmoral\u201d than another (and I say this as a Canadian; I am not talking specifics about any country's political landscape). I was routinely turned off by value-laden phrases such as \u201cthe 'Islam=terrorism' idiocy\u201d, and \u201cthe standard, wearisome critique of atheism\u201d, and in particular, Sapolsky's professed atheism seems instructive: It is because he rejects the notion of humans having anything separate from their brains that make higher level decisions \u2013 whether you want to call that the mind, or the soul, or what he neutrally refers to as the homunculus before rejecting it as ridiculous \u2013 because he doesn't believe there's anything separate from the brain, he believes the gooey stuff of the brain itself contains all there is to know about human behaviour. I'm too agnostic to follow him to an absolute conclusion like that, but can't argue with his ultimate epilogue:\n\u2022 If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase it would be, \u201cIt's complicated\u201d. Nothing seems to cause anything; instead everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep saying, \u201cWe used to think X, but now we realize that...\u201d Fixing one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like 51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49 percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You've amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also have running water, a home, adequate calories, and low odds of festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don't have to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your world. And you've been educated. In other words, you're one of the lucky humans, so try.\u2022 Finally, you don't have to choose between being scientific and being compassionate.\nTwenty-five hours of never boring reading to get to this point was a very good use of my time. The neuroscience did get complex, but Sapolsky ends each chapter with a clarifying summing-up. I also really appreciated Sapolsky's frequent shoutouts to other scientists and what appears to have been an army of undergrads who helped with his research for this book; makes him seem like a good guy and that upped my enjoyment as well."}, {"userName": "Kunal Sen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen", "userReview": "It is common these days to come across people who have developed a strong dislike for all reductionist approaches. They prefer holistic views, and are suspicious of any knowledge that has been derived through breaking up a big problem into smaller chunks. I can understand why they feel that way, but I have always felt that such feelings can only be harbored when one is unfamiliar with the depth of the subject in question, and therefore assumes a simplistic view of things. For example, I know of many people who are suspicious of normal medical science because it treats each organ as a separate functional entity, and expertise within the medical profession is divided by such narrow specializations. They prefer a medical science that looks at the big picture, which includes not just the various sub-systems, but combines the body with the mind. This is a wise and noble thought until we realize the complexity of the whole system. Once we do, the justification of breaking it up into smaller systems become obvious. All the knowledge we have about our body could not have been attained without first breaking it up into the various organs and trying to understand how they work in isolation. Once that has reached a certain level of details can we afford to put them back together and investigate the far more complex interactions between these systems. If we tried to bypass the reductionist step in the first place, we would have been stuck with vague and faulty theories of how the body works, as can be found in all ancient texts. A responsible form of holistic science cannot be rushed. In many cases we may not even be ready to take that step, and must wait till we have better understanding of the parts.Of all the systems we have investigated so far, the physical systems of materials and forces, chemical systems, astronomical systems, and biological systems \u2013 they all yielded fairly well to the scientific reductionist methodologies. However, the biggest challenge lies ahead in understanding the most complex system we have encountered so far \u2013 our mind. Huge progress has been made in this direction in the last few decades. The progress happened through advances in neuroscience, biology, computational science, evolutionary sciences, psychology etc. Problems that were beyond any convincing and demonstrable theory are regularly being converted into understandable bits of knowledge. In this environment of tremendous progress, where all the different branches seems to be converging, it is not unexpected that many specialists start to believe that they have finally figured it out. I have read many books where brilliant minds would try to prove how their specialty, be it neuroscience or evolutionary biology, can finally explain our behavior, our morality, our aesthetic sense, etc. in terms of their science alone.This book is the only one I have read that not only celebrates the great accomplishments of our reductionist approach towards understanding of how the mind works, but also exposes the severe limitations of not appreciating the complexity of all these subsystems when they work together. He systematically shows how each of the systems involved, our neuronal bran, the environment we live in, both in our mother\u2019s womb and the environment outside, our endocrinal systems, our genes, how they all interact and influence each other is incredibly complex ways. The only way we can understand the whole thing is when we allow for these interactions. In other words, why we need to look at the whole thing holistically, while admitting that it can only be done when we understand the parts really well. It is a sobering document because it shows the challenge that lies ahead. Modelling the complexity of the whole system is so complex then we may never be able to crack it open. That is, understanding of an individual mind may remain impossible, while we get better at understanding them in aggregate.The real value of this book is not just in convincing us that full understanding of our mind cannot happen until we integrate all the pieces together, but in nudging us towards a slightly different mindset that can be applied to all complex problems. As in everything else, when we solve one problem, it only presents us with an even more complex problem. And to me, that\u2019s what makes life worth living \u2013 that there will never be a shortage of things to ponder."}, {"userName": "Jayesh ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7482598-jayesh", "userReview": "His classes must be very interesting.

What surprises me the most, it's how many topics this book covered, by the amount of pages if may seem obvious there were many, but when reading it, those pages don't seem to be much for the great work he did. I think the title is the perfect summary of what this book is about ''the biology of humans at our best and worst'' but of course, to cover that you have to go from cells, genes, evolution to race, politics and wars. Therefore, it's a book about biology, but also a book about sociology, psychology, about us.I deepy admire Sapolsky, because it's obvious that this book need a deep interdisciplinary work; he mentions a lot of authors and researchers within his field and outside of it without making this an incomprehensible mix. Also, everyone can read it. This book has a lot of appendices with information that complements or explains in more detail things that might be hard if you don't have a science background, so there isn't an excuse to not read it"}, {"userName": "Literary Chic", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3998101-literary-chic", "userReview": "Definitely for a smarter reader than me. The writing was very good, but what sounded like a fascinating topic was immensely dry. Eventually, all the scientific speak led to hypotheses by the author. Personally, my favorite line of thought was prison time for young offenders. Science has discovered brains aren't fully developed until in our 20's. So, how can we charge 14 year olds as adults?The author kept everything light. He had lighthearted analogies to maintain the readers attention. All in all, excellent writing work in my opinion. However, I found it too mental after a long day at work. Truly 3 stars is more reflective of me as a reader than Dr. Sapolsky as a writer."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11361859-matt", "userReview": "This book is a masterful distillation of academic research on social behavior. It's creatively organized, clearly written, and always fascinating. I listened on audiobook, but will probably buy a physical copy for reference.But I'm only giving it three stars because it completely fails to grapple with the replication crisis sweeping through these fields. After Sapolsky mentioned a study that I know researchers have failed to replicate, I waited for him to discuss the subsequent controversy. He never did. At that point, I started keeping a tally of \"red flags:\" studies that have subsequently come under fire, but where Sapolsky fails to acknowledge any controversy about their findings.The ones I noticed:- People behave themselves when there is an eye watching them, even if it's just a painted eye. Researchers are having trouble replicating this finding: http://lebs.hbesj.org/index.php/lebs/...- Implicit bias tests. Sapolsky uses this literature extensively without criticism. It's not clear it's as useful as people think: http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/...- Willpower is like a muscle that gets tired from use. Something as simple as having a snack can help. Another one that it's not so clear this is true: http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/12/...- People take hurricanes more seriously when they are named after men. Another study that has come in for a pile of criticism: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/...- Legalization of abortion led to a drop in crime two decades later. No. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legaliz... and also Steven Pinker's critique in Better Angels of Our Nature.- Air rage is more likely if coach passengers have to pass through first class. Probably not. http://www.pnas.org/content/113/47/E7... and http://andrewgelman.com/?s=air+rage- Judges are way harsher right before lunch. Non. http://nautil.us/blog/impossibly-hung...- Priming studies (cited extensively). Not so easy to replicate. http://andrewgelman.com/2016/02/12/pr...These issues have percolated through the mainstream. Just last week, the NYTimes had a great feature about the replication crisis, told through the story of Amy Cuddy (whose work is also cited uncritically in Behave): https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/ma...I'm not an expert on this stuff, but I still found all these red flags. There are surely many I've missed. At the same time, because I'm not an expert, I can be convinced that the replication crisis isn't that big a deal. But Sapolsky doesn't even try. Unfortunately, that makes me call into question Sapolsky's authority and credibility as a guide to this literature. It's a doubt that poisoned the whole book for me, including his tour of literatures far removed from the ones above. For example, I don't know much about neuro-imaging studies. About them Sapolsky says \"These studies are difficult to pull off, as neuroimaging is as much an art as a science.\" When I read that, and when I've spent half the book hearing him talk confidently about lots of problematic studies, part of me wonders \"hmmm, so are neuro-imaging studies garbage? Should I just skim this chapter?\" I don't know!Or at other points, he talks about studies I am unfamiliar with but because he's sacrificed his credibility on studies I do know a bit about, I don't trust his interpretations. I think to myself, \"hmmm, that sounds suspect.\" I seriously considered quitting the book because of these issues. I'm glad I stuck with it, because IF THIS STUFF TURNS OUT TO HOLD UP, then it's a wonderfully nuanced portrait of the factors that drive our behavior (neurological, genetic, social). But what a disappointing caveat to have to attach to a book."}, {"userName": "Mehrsa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa", "userReview": "Wow. This book literally covers everything there is to know about evolution, the human brain, behavioral theories, culture, etc. And Sapolsky does it in a fair and humble way. In other words, on the one hand, this and on the other this, but at this point there's more evidence for the latter. He's not selling a pet theory.

It was first published in May, 2017. This is one miracle of a book. I don\u2019t know where to start\u2026\u201cSomeone does something lousy and selfish to you in a game, and the extent of insular and amygdaloid activation predicts how much outrage you feel and how much revenge you take.\u201d \u2015 Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst Book focuses on Robert Sapolsky\u2019s attempt to tackle seemingly impossible question. That is to look at our behavior from every possible angle: biological, psychological, physiological\u2026and there are some historical and cultural angles thrown in to it too. We start with neurobiological angle: what happens in our brains when some specific behavior occurs, what effect do our hormones have on us, what is our genetic makeup, how are we different or even not that different from rest of the animal kingdom\u2026 This is not enough. Sapolsky continues by how environment affects us and also focuses on age-old question: are we formed more by nature or nurture? And indeed as mentioned, then we continue with psychology, history, culture\u2026Behave is among the best nonfiction reads ever. It\u2019s stunning, it\u2019s big and it\u2019s absolutely beautiful. I learned so much and it also changed the way I see some things. Here are some of my picks throughout the chapters of the book:Chapter 4: Hours to Days Before: How testosterone increases confidence and optimism and decreases fear and anxiety. Chapter 5: Days to Months Before: Enough time for Arab spring, for a discontented winter or for STDs to spread a lot during a summer of love\u2026and also plenty of time for our brains to change\u2026How there\u2019s long-term LTP and LTD. And veryy long term LTP and LTD and how they work differently in different regions of our brains.\u201cTestosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.\u201d\u2015 Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapter 15: Metaphors We Kill By: How Rwandan genocide came to be and how metaphors were used as a weapon. Oh the power of metaphors. I have never before realized this. During Rwandan genocide, Tutsis were described as cockroaches. And those cockroaches would steal your husband. They became something that had to be exterminated, swept away from the country. Almost 1 million people dead within 100 days.\u201cSome translation is needed. The Rwandan genocide did not involve tanks, airplanes, dropping bombs or shelling at civilians. There were no concentration camps. No transport trains. No Zyklon-B. There was no bureaucratic banality of evil. There were hardly even many guns.\u201d \u2015 Robert M. Sapolsky, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and WorstChapters 6 & 16: Author explained PMS syndrome. He also explained how PMS syndrome has been used as a criminal defense. And this is not the only sort of crazy sounding criminal defense in the book. There\u2019s also a lot of talk about the development of the brain in earlier chapters and whether a person is or isn\u2019t fully aware of his actions and consequences of those actions due to it\u2026 Adolescence. Or. Dude, where is my frontal cortex as the chapter is called.What else\u2026 Sapolsky uses the analogy of a car with faulty brakes to describe antisocial human behaviour. How judges give less harsh sentences after they have had lunch! Yes you read that right, judges\u2019 rulings\u2019 are harsher when they are hungrier. And this also works with smells. If you\u2019re in a place that smells bad, you more likely to judge a person or a thing in a negative manner, how there was a Christmas truce in 1914 and how in many wars since soldiers had to be threatened to go kill soldiers from the opposite side. And how opposite of love is not hate \u2026it\u2019s indifference. And to conclude. There is no such thing as free will.I loved this book. As you can probably tell from my review, it\u2019s packed with loads and loads of information in a very simplified, easily understood form. Moreover, there\u2019s a sense of humor or sarcasm in the writing and that always gets one more star from me because it\u2019s like authors are laughing at how idiotic some of the things we do are and I really appreciate that (\u2026we do a lot of dumb shit). Maybe the only downside to the book as I was listening to audio version were all the: \u201cfootnotes\u201d and \u201ci see her see i see her see i see?\u201d. They were a bit much in spoken.

The second part of the book has a slightly different format - as the author delves into specific human behavioral traits (like Us vs Them-ing, hierarchies and obedience, morals, usage of metaphors, violence, etc.), and discusses them in detail, often drawing the fundamental expounded upon in the previous chapters. The book has a entertaining myth-busting style. It will present a hypothesis (say testosterone is responsible for aggression), present experiments in favor of it (castration reduces aggression, injecting testosterone back in brings it back), and then present more experiments that poke holes in the earlier somewhat simplistic explanation (raising testosterone to 10% or 200% of original levels makes no difference as compared to raising to 100%). He also talks about the wars within academia on numerous theories/ideas - neurogenesis, mirror neurons, sociobiology, Stanford Prison Experiment findings etc., which, apart from being entertaining, also reinforce my belief that the author does not only present the theories that he \u201clikes\u201d. Though it\u2019s definitely possible that he did that at certain points in the book, I think he presented the nuanced view more often than not. Sometimes, there\u2019s an information overload, as the author presents results from 5-10 studies in a single paragraph. Also, since a lot of these tend to be psychology studies, their results have to be taken with an appropriate amount of salt. Some of the later chapters are a bit preachy (using intuition vs reason in in-group and out-group interactions, why the current justice system is stupid, how to reduce violence)- but since they are backed by fairly solid science, and logical (to me) explanations, I still enjoyed reading them. In the end, I think it\u2019s a great book, and is peppered with humorous anecdotes, both personal and historical, which makes it easier to go through its ~800 pages. The only \u201climitation\u201d of the book is its scope - I don\u2019t really think any single book can cover all the issues that this book tackles - but a list compiled from the books referenced here would probably make a great reading list.

More than a decade in the making, this game-changing book is Robert Sapolsky's genre-shattering attempt to answer that question as fully as perhaps only he could, looking at it from every angle. Sapolsky's storytelling concept is delightful but it also has a powerful intrinsic logic: he starts by looking at the factors that bear on a person's reaction in the precise moment a behavior occurs, and then hops back in time from there, in stages, ultimately ending up at the deep history of our species and its evolutionary legacy. And so the first category of explanation is the neurobiological one. A behavior occurs--whether an example of humans at our best, worst, or somewhere in between. What went on in a person's brain a second before the behavior happened? Then Sapolsky pulls out to a slightly larger field of vision, a little earlier in time: What sight, sound, or smell caused the nervous system to produce that behavior? And then, what hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual is to the stimuli that triggered the nervous system? By now he has increased our field of vision so that we are thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and endocrinology in trying to explain what happened. Sapolsky keeps going: How was that behavior influenced by structural changes in the nervous system over the preceding months, by that person's adolescence, childhood, fetal life, and then back to his or her genetic makeup? Finally, he expands the view to encompass factors larger than one individual. How did culture shape that individual's group, what ecological factors millennia old formed that culture? And on and on, back to evolutionary factors millions of years old. The result is one of the most dazzling tours d'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, a majestic synthesis that harvests cutting-edge research across a range of disciplines to provide a subtle and nuanced perspective on why we ultimately do the things we do...for good and for ill. Sapolsky builds on this understanding to wrestle with some of our deepest and thorniest questions relating to tribalism and xenophobia, hierarchy and competition, morality and free will, and war and peace. Wise, humane, often very funny, Behave is a towering achievement, powerfully humanizing, and downright heroic in its own right.", "title": "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31170723-behave?from_choice=true", "average": 4.41, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1517732866l/31170723.jpg", "reviews": 420, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/187.Robert_M_Sapolsky", "name": "Robert M.
