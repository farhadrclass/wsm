That is one horror, thriller, whatever you want to name it crazy great book! All you horror freaks are down for it, that\u2019s true!This is the second story in \u201cThe Rebecca Underhill Trilogy\u201d. The story develops eight years after Rebecca\u2019s abduction ended over an abandoned wooden house, not very far from the house she sent her childhood. Even though, her abductor, Joseph William Whalen, is dead and gone, her life is not going into peace. She has to think of her only son and the daughter of her friend Robyn, Molly. I turns out the two children can see the boogeyman out in the cornfield, so something is up.The plot is amazingly good, as the author starts the narration of the story by telling the reader about an escape an old honest detective reads about. So the scene is set for what is to follow. Then he continues by introducing the two artists, single mother friends. He describes enough so the reader can understand their way of living, their history and their current story, without becoming tiring. This is also a very good reason that the book can be read as stand alone and can be fully understood and followed up.The writing is keeping up with the suspense and it creates the horror type of atmosphere that one would expect of such a book. The creepiness is there to remind the reader of the true nature of the villain. Don\u2019t fall for this guy, unless you have serious psychiatric issues to deal with\u2026It is a true horror thriller like book, no question about that. The scenes are visualized in the reader\u2019s mind as if watching a movie. It is all about action and suspense and going through the good stuff that can clearly evolve to a good old nightmare, given a vivid imagination."}, {"userName": "Coco.V", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42214962-coco-v", "userReview": "\ud83d\udc9d FREE on Amazon today (1/6/2018)! \ud83d\udc9d"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47681565-jennifer", "userReview": "Crazy Good!!Once again, Mr Zandri's writing has floored me. This book had me on pins and needles. I will not be screaming any spoiler alerts, suffice it to say if you have read book one, The Remains, hold to your pants, this was as good or even better!!! It can be read as a stand alone, as Mr Zandri, gives enough hints of The Remains to kind of clue you in as you go. That being said, you really should read them in order. For one, it gives you a better background for this book, as the main characters are the same. And second, it ramps up the adrenaline as you read this one. If you have read any of Mr. Zandri's writing, you will not be disappointed. Once again he takes you on that psychological roller coaster ride. His descriptive way of writing, puts you right in the moment!! GREAT READ!!! Thank again Mr. Zandri."}, {"userName": "Jay Williams", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18276597-jay-williams", "userReview": "A topflight horror story with suspense so thick you feel it. The Boogeyman is real, and he lives in the cornfield behind your barn. You have to stomach the gore associated with a villain who skins people alive and uses their faces as disguises. The story is less about the characters and more about the action. It reminded me of a \"B\" horror movie."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "Warning: If you are not a fan of blood and gore than you have been warned. Although, I will tell you that the blood and gore is minimum. The horror is not so much in the blood or gore but in the suspense. Yet, you might want to read this book with the lights on. If you thought your fears of the Boogeyman was over; after reading this book they just might come back. This is the second book in this trilogy. I have not read the first book, yet it did not de-track from my experience reading this book. In fact, I had a good idea of what happened in the first one as this story was somewhat connected to the prior novel. Again, however I did not find it necessary to have read the first one prior to reading this book. After finishing this book, I do plan to go back and read the first one. Additionally, as this is a trilogy and that means three books, I can't wait to read the third one as well. After enduring the horrific ordeal that Rebecca did in the prior novel, it would have been easy for her to just lay down and give up. Rebecca was not the strongest female but she was still strong when it counted the most. I hope to see Rebecca come out the ultimate survivor in the third book. Mr. Zandri has just gained a new fan in me. The Ashes is just what the doctor ordered for horror fans!"}, {"userName": "Tere Fredericks", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20909438-tere-fredericks", "userReview": "Although this is the second part of a trilogy, it CAN be read as a standalone. However, you do get more out of it if you read The Remains first. Eight years after the events in The Remains, Rebecca and her best friend Robyn, and their children, Michael Jr. and Molly, are living together in the house where Rebecca and her twin sister Molly (for whom Robyn\u2019s daughter is named). They have made the barn into an art studio and are generally enjoying life. As they have extra land to one side of them, they rent the land out for a neighbor to grow corn.Their nearest neighbor, Sam Goodman, has bought the house next door, where Rebecca\u2019s good friends lived until their deaths. Sam also rents out part of his property for the same neighbor to grow corn. Rebecca is concerned that Michael has been talking about two different voices he\u2019s been hearing. One \u2013 from the barn \u2013 is his father, he says. The other, even more disturbing, is from the cornfield, and he says that voice is from Mr. Skinner. Michael is only eight, but he has the ability to draw that Rebecca\u2019s friend Franny did. He draws a very good likeness of his father, which Rebecca puts down to having seen pictures of him all over the house. However, the person he calls Mr. Skinner makes her skin crawl. Little does anyone know that Mr. Skinner had been a former cell mate of Whalen, who had kidnapped Rebecca twice.As the book progresses, learning about the man, Skinner, who adored Whalen before Whalen was released and Skinner escaped (after Whalen\u2019s death) and why the police may not be broadcasting the fact of his escape scared me to death. What if this is going on right now, anywhere? Whalen had a preference for basements. So, it seems, does Skinner. Only Skinner makes basements more terrifying. I\u2019m glad our washer and dryer are upstairs and I have no reason at all to go into ours. The last few chapters, as in The Remains, will have you holding your breath, reluctant to release air for fear you will be gasping in more in a paragraph or two. Literally until the last chapter, when everything you are scared for for Rebecca to admit takes her where she needs to go comes true, you cannot help but be terrified for what comes next. This is another edge of your seat, what the holy baloney can he have happen next, type of book. The characters (with the obvious exceptions of the boogeymen) are very likeable. You want to urge them on to the best life ever. Until we learn of Skinner. Then we are terrified for them. You know those movies where you scream at the character: don\u2019t go into the basement. Well, here you go. There\u2019s a reason for that! Loved this book and the one before it, and highly recommend it. Where\u2019s Rebecca #3?"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4817090-lori", "userReview": "3.5 starsAn entertaining and enjoyable story. I would definitely listen to the series the order. I was a little lost in the beginning, but the story gives you enough details from the first book to fill in the blanks fairly quickly. The story pulls you in from the start and keeps your attention until the end.The story is full of suspense and creepiness that builds continuously keeping you on edge never knowing what to expect. The really intense action, violence and gore happen farther into the story, more towards the last quarter of the book. Rebecca is a survivor. She has been through more than most could handle. She's a strong, independent woman but then there were also several things/decisions that made Rebecca come across as not the sharpest crayon in the box and one of those characters that\u2019s TSTL at times. So one minute your rooting for her and the next your thinking. Seriously? Really? Why would you do that? Skinner is one of those Villains/Psycho's that will stick with you and have you thinking about long after the story is over.It will definitely make you think twice before running into a cornfield. You never know what could be in there. It's a great hiding place. This is not the first time I have listened to a book Evie Cameron has narrated. She does a good job with the narration. Her voice fit the main character and sounded age appropriate. There isn't a lot of difference between her character voices in this book. Still her voice is easy to listen to for long periods of time and the narration is clearly spoken with a nice even pace. A bit more difference in the character voices, especially Skinner's and the more intense moments of the story would have been nice though.

There was enough background given on the events of Book 1 that I was able to dive in with no problem. Rebecca has survived two kidnappings and is now being stalked by Skinner, a Hannibal Lector-like character.This was a great thriller, full of suspense and just so utterly creepy. There was also some gore, so it may not be for the squeamish. I thought that the narrator did a good job with the pacing and character voices. Some of Rebecca's actions didn't quite make sense though. When the children go missing, Rebecca and Robin have a cigarette before looking for them? Why aren't the police immediately brought in when her son tells her that the man he's seen is the same escaped killer on her computer screen? What's with her dead sister and ex-husband's voices in her head? And why does she still live in that house with all those horrible memories? Even with those niggling questions, I still loved The Ashes and would recommend it.I was voluntarily provided this review copy audiobook at no charge by the author, publisher and/or narrator.

This put me on the edge of my chair and the hairs on my arm were tingling. I missed Book One, The Remains, but after reading this one, it's next on my list. You can definitely read as stand alones but I only wish I'd read the first book before this one. This was a thrill ride for sure.  We get a little of the background from the first book to give us an idea of what's going on. You won't want to be alone when you read this and be sure to keep the light on. Above all, lock the doors and close the curtains. You'll find yourself jerking at every little noise and rattle. I'm a real fan of horror stories and this is right up there. It will make your heart beat fast for sure. Your imagination will go on over drive and you'll remember this one for a long time to come. The author gives you all of it. Suspense, the creepiness, murder, and so much more. You might even have a nightmare from an over active imagination.So many twists and turns with each page you flip. Eight years passed after Rebecca Underhill,a single mom, was taken and left to die. A house, broken down, in the middle of a deep, dark forest. Eight years after and it has started again, someone is after her. Her original abductor has since died. Who is stalking her? Someone wants to finish the job the first kidnapper didn't. Why and Who? How will he get to her? Rebecca is facing the worst of all. You have to read this and find out how and who the stalker is and how he plans to get to her. Perhaps the first kidnapper really wasn't killed! OR? Are her children in danger? The suspense will keep you turning those pages even though you may want to set the book down.

The only problem is when you have this much perfection going on, imperfections stick out like a sore thumb. The book is everything the summary pumps it up to be, except for the major prominent flaw that ruins things. Skinner, the killer, flays his victims' faces off and uses them as functioning masks, among his other deplorable attributes and deeds. Impossible stretch! This could have easily been resolved by Zandri expressing how Skinner thought he was fooling others, but wasn't. Or by expressing Skinner going through painful processes to make the skins real- to- life.Nevertheless, it's true- to- the- core horror/ thriller stuff, if you're into this genre. The reading is really easy too. Also, apart from the \"prominent flaw\" everything is in place.
