So I was so excited when I saw that she had written Rules for Virgins, a short novella spoken in the voice of an aging courtesan who is providing advice and \u201con-the-job\u201d training to a virgin courtesan in China on the proverbial \u201ceve\u201d of her deflowering.Like Ms. Tan\u2019s other stories, the main theme revolves around traditional female roles in Chinese culture, but this time it addresses the role that the courtesan played in this society. Through this first-person advice session, the reader both learns the intricate technicalities of successful courtesanship, while also empathizing with the likes of young Violet, who is destined to have her heart broken and suffer a lonely, loveless life. I am happy that Ms. Tan is working on a new full-length novel, The Valley of Amazement, to be released in Fall 2012.

I'm a big Amy Tan fan, but this didn't have any of the traits that I usually admire in her work. The writing was fine, but empty. There was no emotion, no character development, no... movement. It was essentially a bunch of research presented as a monologue. Interesting/informative? Sure. But I expect more from Amy Tan than just that.HOWEVER. If you look at this story simply as setup for Valley of Amazement -- the characters, the setting, the frame of mind -- then it at least accomplishes something, because I am interested in seeing an actual STORY blossom from this seed."}, {"userName": "Jennifer ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5685328-jennifer", "userReview": "In 1912 Shanghai, being a courtesan is more than a career, it's a chance at independence. A smart girl can leverage a few years of seduction into a lifetime of security. Fortunately for new girl Violet, she's got famous former courtesan Magic Gourd to guide her. It's not just about pleasing rich men, it's about making alliances and planning for the long term. Violet has the youth and beauty, and Magic Gourd has the experience and a strategic mind any general would envy. This is a beautiful piece of work. Perhaps not what you've come to expect from Amy Tan, but that's in no way a bad thing. This is what a military campaign would look like if you dressed it up in silk and set it loose on society. Think of those genteel southern ladies with a core of steel - they'll crush you underfoot while you apologize for making them get up - and you'll understand the tone here.  Magic Gourd lays out a manual for success through seduction - she's got plans, strategic retreats, and second strikes organized and ready to go. Fans of Memoirs Of A Geisha and A Geisha's Life will recognize the businesslike approach, but be warned, Magic Gourd is not one to worry about Violet's delicate sensibilities. They're selling sex, and the only thing that matters is putting it in a package that will net them the highest price.  Ultimately this is a tale of women's liberation. You use what you have, give men what they want, and charge them for the privilege. Youth and beauty don't last, but if you play your cards right you'll have enough to live the rest of your life on your own terms, and that is something you can't put a price on."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Huston", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4091267-rebecca-huston", "userReview": "A lovely, bawdy, novella that is set as a series of lessons given to a young courtesan by her older companion of the perils and advantages of working as a courtesan to Shanghai's elite in the early 20th century.

You won\u2019t find any courtesans like that in this house, so don\u2019t you become one.Here, we don\u2019t go back and forth on the price. It is three dollars for a party, and it does not include riding on the stem. No argument.Some of my clients reached the heights through eyes alone. You think that\u2019s victory? Ha. Once the stem shrinks to normal, the man is no longer urgent. He\u2019s content to go home.We all thought he should have had his stem cut off and fed to the dogs, and the madam of the house thought so, too. She hired gangsters to track him down, and let\u2019s just say that they fed that dog much more than his stem.There is a type who thinks he can order up any kind of sex, like dishes on a menu.Whatever any man requests, you should never degrade him for his desires, nor should you accept being degraded.

You know what happens to a woman who lets herself be degraded? She winds up with a pimp and lies on the floor of a chophouse, where rickshaw pullers and laborers fuck her, one after another, a hundred a day. She never has a chance to close her legs or her mouth until she\u2019s pounded into raw meat and dies. I\u2019ve always wondered why those women don\u2019t kill themselves.

It has moments of an extremely detailed sexual nature, and although I am an adult myself, I was a bit taken aback by how brazen and descriptive this was.As novellas go, this was a relatively quick read that I finished between 2 sittings. It is told from the first person point of view from a well-traveled concubine to her predecessor, a younger girl who has not yet been introduced into the society yet. I would liken this to \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" in that way, however, it is far more detailed and at times a little too dirty!I would re-read this novella again because it is short and precise, however I was not over the moon about it in some ways.

I'm relieved to find out that it's an excerpt from a forthcoming novel because I'd quite like to learn about the wider narrative that it comes from. I particularly enjoyed the very last line. Magic Gourd is often amusing in her plain-spokenness, although I'm more intrigued about her story, especially after the few cryptic hints she includes about her past as a courtesan. It's interesting to think that there were tabloids back then or something akin to them. I wonder if that's true.I once saw a movie about courtesans in Shanghai. It wasn't a very interesting movie but I'd certainly like to see where Amy Tan plans to take this story.

I love historical fiction & this novella explores a niche I\u2019ve not yet read about in this kind of detail. Tan handles the explicit sexual content with some humor and it\u2019s the briefness is the format feels fitting - almost like the virgin sneaking a peek but not looking for too long. It\u2019s fascinating to reflect on this lifestyle having been a social status quo compared to the society\u2019s current view of sex & morality. In the current world of slut shaming, it\u2019s also interesting to think about the rising movement to empower and remove the stigma of sex workers today in contrast to a time when many some women used sex work to obtain financial independence (in a society & time where women had even fewer rights and perceived value). Without getting to heavy, she reminds the reader of the hazards of the work and the social constructs that made this work the only viable option for some (young) women and girls. The personal history that motivated Tan to research and write this story is also interesting. I appreciate her imagination in making the general historical events come alive with these two particular main characters.

I had not read anything by Amy Tan previously, but this sounded so intriguing that I figured I'd shell out the $1.99. Written in the voice of an \"attendant\" talking to a \"virgin courtesan\" in 1912 Shanghai, teaching her the many aspects of what to expect as she prepares to begin her \"career,\" the wording runs the spectrum from euphemistic (\"defloration\") to raw (a few times, she uses the word \"fuck\" as casually as one might say, in open conversation, \"sleep with\" to refer to having sex). What I gained from this book was a grasp of the reality (I trust Tan writes out of authentic knowledge and research) that working as a courtesan in that time and place was (at least at its best) an entirely different thing from being a prostitute. There was an entire culture framing the lives of these girls and young women -- as well as of the men (often married) who become their \"suitors\" and \"patrons\" and of the suitors'/patrons' wives. That is to say, it was apparently well known to and accepted by the wives that their husbands spent time with courtesans. The attendant even refers to men taking their sons (she doesn't mention age, but I gather young to mid-teens) to visit a courtesan to be trained in what to do to be intimate with women. Certainly, to our contemporary U.S. sensibilities (though I realize, even in saying that, that the U.S. is not composed of just one culture when it comes to what is considered sexually acceptable), the descriptions in this book are mind-boggling, to say the least. But the power in the book is how it can lead you to stand outside your ingrained understandings of propriety and accept, if nothing else, the idea that, in a different culture, the interactions portrayed in Rules for Virgins are not \"wrong\" or \"abusive\" or \"perverted\"; they just are."}, {"userName": "Erin (PT)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2285338-erin-pt", "userReview": "I'm reading an anthology of short stories at the same time that I read this and, in one sense, Tan's short story illustrates exactly what I'm not enjoying about the other book; that is, it's a lucid and linear story that creates its setting and characters in a straightforward way that invites me in immediately and allows me to immerse in the story from the outset. One of the things I like most about Tan's work is that she writes about worlds that I'm not functionally familiar with, but writes about them in ways that are eminently relatable. I wasn't completely clear about the time frame of Rules for Virgins and, for obvious reasons, not all of it is entirely relevant to a modern woman, but there's an unselfconscious straightforwardness to the advice offered by our narrator that makes me wish I'd had (and other women could have) this kind of pragmatic advice as a sweet, young thing on the cusp of sexual womanhood. That being said, the lack of larger context (or perceptible context, because people more familiar with the culture and setting might have gotten contextual clues that went over my head as an American of a different race/culture) or deeper characterization than is possible in such a short story, my suspension of disbelief was marred by my uncertainty whether I was supposed to take the narrator as reliable or not (my default setting is not) and so I kept waiting for some twist or reveal that never came. Which, as I said, can be my fault as a reader, for assuming all narrators are unreliable. But it definitely affected my reading experience. As well, the story's ending felt abrupt and lacking in oomph, which made it feel like a pleasant and interesting reading experience, but not one that's going to stick with me for any length of time.

Don't get me wrong, I can certainly understand that for some people, or characters, sex is work, that's not what is bothering me. It's a long monologue, an experienced older woman educating a virgin in the ways of her budding \"career\". What bothers me is that it seems \"flat\", no high, it feels like everything is on the same tone, that there's information which must be transferred from one person to the next and it's simply being done. What I'm thinking is that there must be something that this woman liked in her life, there must have been moments that she enjoyed and I'm not necessarily talking about sex, it could have been the singing, the clothes, the competition, the money, whatever! Or maybe something that she hated. I think you get my point, what I'm getting at. The thought that the more experienced woman might be trying to relive her \"good younger years\" through her pupil did cross my mind while I was reading, so there must be some implied emotional reaction on her part somewhere for the thought to come to me but, it's not enough... It is wonderfully written, mrs Tan is a great writer, but it feels too static to keep my interest, good thing it was a short read.

These ancient tricks of the trade aren't written down, though; to pass them on to her student, Magic Gourd must reach back into her own professional past, bringing her lessons alive with stories and anecdotes from a career spent charming and manipulating men who should have known better but rarely did.The world of sexual intrigue that Tan reveals in \"Rules for Virgins\" actually existed once, and she spares no detail in recreating it. But this story is more than intriguing (and sometimes shocking) historical literary fiction. Besides inviting us inside a life that few writers but Tan could conjure up, the intimate confessions of Magic Gourd add up to a kind of military manual for the War of the Sexes\u2019 female combatants. The wisdom conveyed is ancient, specific, and timeless, exposing the workings of vanity and folly, calculation and desire that define the mysterious human heart.", "title": "Rules for Virgins", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13144428-rules-for-virgins", "average": 3.4, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328112246l/13144428.jpg", "reviews": 232, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5246.Amy_Tan", "name": "Amy Tan"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Short Stories", "Cultural", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13144428-rules-for-virgins", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13172161-rules-for-virgins", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14598127-rules-for-virgins", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7763.The_Joy_Luck_Club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12555.The_Bonesetter_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12557.The_Kitchen_God_s_Wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/690866.The_Hundred_Secret_Senses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17383934-the-valley-of-amazement", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
