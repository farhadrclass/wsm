(How would she know? Mothers know everything.) This is her favorite book/movie/miniseries. My first reaction to hearing this story was to stare blankly, shake my head and think to myself, 'parents have the worst taste in books.' I grew up on Britney, Christina and Backstreet Boys. I survived Twilight. I owned a a bright pink Spice Girls T-shirt that had matching shorts with white hearts (and wore it proudly in public).My future offspring will think I'm the coolest, I just know it.\nI was wrong about many things, including Thorn Birds. It wasn\u2019t until I saw the miniseries that I understood the beauty of Thorn Birds. Ah, finally I understood what the fuss was all about. Without question I knew what I had to do next. I had to read the book. There was, however, a problem in the process. There was no book. The book somehow ended up in the possession of my cousin. So I kinda, sorta took it from her. (It's not stealing if you're family. I am not a book thief). This was the second time I read this book, and I enjoyed it even more this time around. When I read it a second time, I picked up things that I missed the first time. Also, apparently I misinterpreted the ending, now I finally understand what the author was trying to say.But let's go back a bit. I honestly don't think that I have ever seen a more beautiful opening paragraph.   There is a legend about a bird which sings just once in its life, more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth. From the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree, and does not rest until it has found one. Then, singing among the savage branches, it impales itself upon the longest, sharpest spine. And, dying, it rises above its own agony to out- carol the lark and the nightingale. One superlative song, existence the price. But the whole world stills to listen, and God in His heaven smiles. For the best is only bought at the cost of great pain.  \nIt touched my soul. I think what I love most about the book is its realism. The characters seemed so real, I almost forgot they were fake. There is a part of me that still thinks they exist, somewhere in the Australian outback. \nIf you're looking for a feel-good, disneyesque story, look elsewhere. This book is filled with heartbreaking moments. The characters are hard-working, no-nonsense, and above all, persevering.   \u201cYou still think love can save us. It\u2019s more killing than hate. Hate is so clean, so simple. Like being in the ring. With hate, you just keep hitting. You hit until they stop hitting back. With love\u2026 They never stop.\u201d  The main characters.Meggie Cleary. We first meet up with Meggie as a young girl, vying for attention and affection. As the only daughter in a house full of boys, she is often forgotten, overlooked and neglected (with the exception of her oldest brother and father). She is a sensitive child who receives no love from her mother. Meggie's life changes when her father is invited to live and work in the estate of his wealthy sister in Australia. There she meets a man who will become the love of her life. \n\nMeggie is a truly tragic figure. Everyone she had ever loved had either left her or died. No matter how much she vowed never to be like her mother, that's exactly what happened. Like her mother before her, Meggie marries a man she doesn't love. Knowingly or unknowingly, she makes the same mistakes with her children as her mother. Had fate played a cruel trick on her? Perhaps so. Depends on your personal beliefs.   In a sense Ralph was like God; everything began and ended with him. Since the day he had knelt in the sunset dust of the Gilly station yard to take her between his hands, there had been Ralph, and though she never saw him again as long as she lived, it seemed likely that her last thought this side of the grave would be of him. How frightening, that one person could mean so much, so many things.  Ralph de Bricassart. At the start of the novel, Ralph is an ambitious young priest, banished to the outback for insulting a bishop. He befriends the Cleary's, growing especially close with little Meggie. He immediately takes her under his wing, and offers her the love and guidance (in a non creepy way) she so desperately craves. \n\nOh Ralph... He's made mistakes, but it's hard not to feel sorry for him. He is a good man (albeit too prideful) torn between his own love for Meggie and his love for God. It was a constant battle. A battle with no end and no winners.   \u201cMeggie, I love you. You\u2019re my rose, the most beautiful human image and thought in my life.\u201d\u201cAn image, a thought! A human image and thought! Yes, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s all I am to you! You\u2019re nothing but a romantic, dreaming fool, Ralph de Bricassart! You have no more idea of what life is all about than the moth I called you! No wonder you became a priest!\u201c  \n\n  \u201cEach of us has something within us which won't be denied, even if it makes us scream aloud to die. We are what we are, that's all. Like the old Celtic legend of the bird with the thorn in its breast, singing its heart out and dying. Because it has to, its self-knowledge can't affect or change the outcome, can it? Everyone singing his own little song, convinced it's the most wonderful song the world has ever heard. Don't you see? We create our own thorns, and never stop to count the cost. All we can do is suffer the pain, and tell ourselves it was well worth it.\u201d  To all you romantics out there: read this book (if you haven't already). \n  \u201cWhen we press the thorn to our chest we know, we understand, and still we do it.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "There could be thirteen million things to write about this book - but since I'm 'retired'.....only writing abbreviated reviews- I'll try to make this short. This novel must have been one of the most scandalous- talked about novels - to hit the book shelves back in 1977. And..... it was a *FINE* read these past few days!!!!! By *FINE*, I mean a VERY ADDICTIVE compelling engrossing WONDERFUL read.....an epic that stretches our hearts beyond the Outback regions of Australia. Tidbits.........The relationship between Father Ralph de Bricassart and Meggie Cleary calls for a lengthy book club discussion- in itself!! Father Ralph says: \"I've known Meggie since she was ten years old, only days off the boat from New Zealand. You might in truth say I've known Meggie through flood and fire and emotional famine, and through death, and life. All that we have to bear. Meggie is the mirror in which I'm forced to view my mortality\". .....A theme that never got off the ground: Early in this novel, when Meggie was a small child - in school with the nuns- she became friends with a little black girl. Racial tensions between the families grew out of injustice when Meggie had lice in her hair. We soon move into part II of the novel. All we learned was the black family had to 'move'. I thought we'd see more 'racial' injustice stories - but this novel never followed that path. .....One of my favorite characters was Frank..... 'the way' we discover his where-a-bouts years later was so darn sad. The 'worsening psychosis' news comes with no background story. I was left hanging 'too' long. Frank was often in my thoughts... I wanted more of him. His love for his mother, Fee, and only sister Meggie reminded me of 'what's right' in life. But I wanted more of 'that' too- Yet so much tragedy-no Peace Frank's father - Paddy - while growing up. Sad... just sad! .....Mary Carson - sister of Paddy, ( Meggie's father) -was one hell of a nice lady -- ha!!!! A narcissistic snake! lol\"The good die young\"... was the only sentence that brought me to tears - the scene with Dane.. was pretty emotional- and that damn sentence \"the good die young\" is once of those sentences that can piss me off - fast - if in 'the moment' of grief. My dad died young. I'm not sure I find that sentence comforting 'at all'! Justine- As unfair as I felt she was 'emotionally' loved by her mother- Meggie...she was my least favorite character in the book too. And... for no real reason - she didn't do anything wrong --( I did like her relationship with her brother) -- but I was too interested in other characters, more. I could go on and on and on.....It's filled with drama, tabu themes, forbidden love, angst, secrets, love, family, marriage, illness, death, loyalty, money, religion, sex, - heartbreaking and affirmative... gorgeously written - master-storytelling!! Thanks for all the - many friends here who encouraged me to read this!! I'm thrilled I did!!!"}, {"userName": "Shannon (Giraffe Days)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395599-shannon-giraffe-days", "userReview": "I've wanted to read this book for years, but I'm glad I waited till I was at a stage in my life when I might appreciate it the most (though it wasn't deliberate). I didn't know anything about the story before I started except that it's a classic Australian novel, epic in scope, and was made into a mini-series or something starring Rachel Ward years ago. I like not knowing much about books before I read them, though: it leaves you wide-open for the story to be told, and absorbed.This is indeed an epic book. It spans three generations of the Cleary family, focusing mostly on Meggie. Starting in New Zealand on the day of her fourth birthday, The Thorn Birds follows the large family of Paddy and Fee and their children Frank, Bob, Jack, Hughie, Stuart, Meggie and baby Hal as they sail to Australia at the invitation of Paddy's wealthy land-owning sister Mary, who intends him to inherit the vast estate of Drogheda in northwest NSW. Even by Australian standards, it's a big farm: 250,000 acres, 80 miles across at its widest point, home to over 100,000 merino sheep.The Clearys, who had been poor farmhands in NZ, fall in love with Drogheda and learn the ways of the land, the climate, the weather, the animals, pretty quickly. The book is divided up into 7 sections titled Meggie 1915-1917; Ralph 1921-1928; Paddy 1929-1932; Luke 1933-1938; Fee 1938-1953; Dane 1954-1965; and Justine 1965-1969. These provide a slight focus, but the only characters who really dominate the story are Meggie, Ralph - the Catholic priest who falls in love with her - and Justine, Meggie's daughter by Luke.There is definitely tragedy in this book, but I never once found it depressing. It is similar in its structure to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, but completely different, and successful in a way the latter book was not (for me): The Thorn Birds made me care. Each character is so beautifully rendered, as if they were indeed living people whose memories were captured by a light, non-judgemental hand. Every character evoked strong feelings in me, which changed as the characters changed. Luke, for instance, I wanted to throttle and ended up pitying. Meggie, in her naivete, was at times exasperating, yet she learned and I was proud of her for that - then angry, for the way she set Dane above Justine. Sometimes I absolutely hated Ralph and wanted to smack him; at other times I felt so deeply for him and his emotional turmoil.I can't get over how well written this book is. It is simply told, in an omniscient third-person voice, only sometimes, when needed, delving in deeper into the hearts and minds of the main characters to reveal their thoughts and feelings. The clashing perceptions people have are accurately portrayed, the poor judgements, bad decisions, mistakes - all so life-like, so real. Inferences, connections and insights can be deduced from hints in the story, but McCullough leaves a lot for the reader to realise on their own. And behind it all, like a glorious backdrop, the gorgeous landscape, so vivid and true. History and politics are there also: two world wars, the Depression, the Great Drought that ended when WWII ended, everything from clothing to attitudes to cars, as well as changing Australian slang, attitudes, the quirks - most of it slipping in unobtrusively, at other times pivotal to the plot.That there is a plot is undeniable: that it is noticeable, I doubt very much. I don't like to predict stories anyway - the only ones I do that to are unavoidable, like Steven Seagal movies - but there was very little in this book that I could have predicted had I tried. Maybe I'm just out of practice, but there was no sense of an author dictating or pushing the characters towards certain goals. A few things I could see coming, like Dane turning out just like his father, but even then it felt completely natural, not as though McCullough was manipulating the story.It seems funny, reading a book of extreme heat, drought, flies, fire, endless silvery grass while outside it's freezing, snowing, bleak. But I was utterly transported, and the only thing that jarred my pleasure was the strangeness of seeing American spelling and a couple of changed words amidst the Australian slang. Why, for instance, change \"nappy\" to \"diaper\" while leaving \"mum\" for \"mom\"? (As an aside, in general I really hate it when books from the UK and Australia, for instance, must undergo an Americanisation before being published in North America, whereas when books by US authors are published in Australia it's with the American spelling and all. That just doesn't seem fair! It seems pretty insulting to the Americans I've talked to, actually, but also patronising to us.) I think, though, regardless of whose decision that was, McCullough was writing to an international audience. She never intended this book to stagnate in Australia, as many works do which are \"too difficult to understand\" in other countries. She doesn't talk about crutching the dags on the sheep without explaining what crutching means and what dags are, or that the big lizards are called goannas and rabbits were introduced to Australia so that it would look a little more like England for the homesick settler - I know all this, but it was still interesting to read about it.If you're interested in reading about Australia (or just epic stories in general), this is a great book to start with. It's not even out-of-date, things change so slowly! Just picture stockmen flying helicopters around herds of cattle instead of riding, their properties are so humungous. The droughts are still there, the floods, the flies, the fires, the vernacular - though the Catholics have almost disappeared. The religion aspect of the novel is equally fascinating, and handled diplomatically as well. It is a book about ordinary people living ordinary lives, and sometimes deliberately causing themselves pain: hence the reference to the thorn bird, which pierces its breast on a rose thorn as it sings, and dies."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "This beaut of a soap opera has been around for decades & for excellent reason. Epics have been forgotten and more readily current authors satisfy readers (or do not, as the case may be) with smaller stories & smaller lives.McCullough has the tenacity to include three generations in this sprawling saga, and as family portraits usually tell of differences between the generations PLUS the ties that bind them together and to a home, this one exactly does that in an extremely entertaining fashion.Fee marries her second choice, not the man of her dreams, and becomes pregnant with more or less the number of digits one has in both hands; she lives a quiet & ironically isolationist existence. Her daughter Meggie, the protagonist until her daughter takes the helm, also suffers her mother's character flaws... fate plus genes a maudling story make. Her priest Ralph, in what is the central love story, chooses God over his heart. The same is not repeated but is indeed echoed in the last generation as Justine, who finally breaks the curse, leaves the warmth and monotony of her family in Drogheda to actually take flight & follow her instincts which had failed the Cleary women in the past.There are only 19 chapters in this massive chronology and many events occur, mostly random and sometimes poetic, but they never fail to surprise. There are so many characters, & all of them, you feel, actually employ humanity, act like actual persons that may have lived. There are acts of stupidity and compassion. People repress many feelings, more for personal convictions than for social or familial obligations we seldom don't visit in books such as these!Ralph is an idiot for causing so much pain to both he and his love. What does that say about organized religion and the crimson-clothed of the almighty Vatican? The Clearys, though not intelligent mainly because of the collective \"Irish pauper\" mentality the patriarchal figure bestows upon his offspring (Papa Cleary and Ralph's proxy, Luke pretty much F*** things up for the rest). They are, however, extremely hard workers and this pays off well. There are many morals, many moments of euphoria, and even slight (by today's standards) snippets of hot erotica! You pretty much stand witness to one of the most complex yet endearing pieces of literature.Highlights: 1) the death of one of the Cleary boy's via warthog asphyxiation immediately following the death of his father via fiery \"holocaust.\" 2) Ralph meeting his love at her retreat where she is in isolation is definately one of the most romantic notions I have ever read... it is written with the finest sense of what love really is. 3) learning what \"French Letters\" mean. 4) transition from New Zealand to Australia to Rome, Greece, London. Such sprawls indicate that life can expand from its moldy origins to experience infinite possiblities, arrive at distal ends.I recommend this book for someone not afraid to having a two-three week relationship with a soap opera that, unlike those on t.v., does not insult the audience with romantic cliches or expected \"disasters.\" The novel is organic: a testament of lives that experience pain and pleasure. The reader only experiences the latter."}, {"userName": "Nettle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7446857-nettle", "userReview": "Oh my fucking God.

He lusts after her for the rest of the book but he is Married to God and the author takes pains to mention how he can never get it up, several times. Apart from about 4 days in a honeymoon hotel bareback where he never again considers he could have made her pregnant, even when being faced with his own son for several hours a day for 10 years. Nobody ever says \"fuck man he looks just like you,\" and never once does he think \"You know she left her husband right close to when this kid was conceived right about the time of those 4 days in a honeymoon hotel\"Oh man I'm not going to go into it.

This story spans over three generations of the Cleary family. It mainly centres around young, Meggie who is the only girl in the family. Meggie's mother only has eyes for her sons which leaves. Meggie feeling very unloved by her mother. Growing up there are many things, Meggie needs to know about life in general, but Meggie knows she can't ask her mother. So Meggie turns to the the local priest, Father Ralph de Bricassart for answers. Ralph is very fond of, Meggie and the more he see her the stronger his feelings become. He can also see that Meggie is also starting to have feelings for him and knows he must put a stop to this before it goes any further. As the story unfolds we see the Cleary family deal with love and loss and with loss comes heartache.I absolutely LOVED this amazing story. This is the first book I've read by, Colleen McCullough and it definitely won't be my last. The descriptions of the places in this book are incredible and you can picture it all so clearly as you are reading. This was a compelling, enjoyable and emotional read. This book took me quite awhile to get through, but it's one of those books that should not be hurried. If you love reading Classic or Historical novels then make sure this one is at the top of your list. I read this book with, Kathy a friend of mine who also loves reading. Although, Kathy read this book quite a long time ago she enjoyed just as much if not more the second time round. A truly memorable book that will stay with me for a long time to come.

I think anti-romance would be a better way to define this novel. In fact- in this way- The Thornbirds reminds me of the pulitzer-prize winning Lonesome Dove which- I would argue- is actually an anti-Western. Both The Thornbirds and Lonesome Dove find the outer reaches of their chosen genres (romance or western) and then push as far as they can, fighting and buckling against the constraints that the genres impose, standing theme and plot on their head and inventing a new world of literature.Both novels result in loaded, epic tomes, like some sort of Biblical whale that swallows everything in its path. So: The Thornbirds is epic (Australian) history, family psychology, feminism, theology, romance and anti-romance and melodramatic tragedy nearing Shakespearian ordinance. Oh, and solid, almost brilliant, use of the omniscient narrator in action.Let's break it down:History: The Thornbirds gives us a panoramic view of the development of Australia from just before World War I through the 1960's including wars, hard times, the development of technology, changing fashions and styles, and changing culture itself. These changes manifest or appear mostly in the background of the novel which is really focused on three generations of women of the Cleary family and the men who (would) love them, but make no mistake, this is also a novel about the land itself and how it is transformed both by nature and by people. In fact, one of the biggest characters in The Thorn Birds is Drogheda, the massive estate (and sheep farm) that plays a major role in the lives of four generations of people. If other parts of the world are transformed by mankind, Drogheda- which sits on the edge of the blazing Australian outback- is that which resists the march of progress. Any progress that comes must trickle in so as not to disturb the blazing heat, endless dust, dry lightning storms, and the needs of 125,00 merino sheep.Colleen McCullough is the author of The Thorn Birds, and as a writer, she brings a lot of good stuff to the table. One is her ability to report on natural and historic detail. Whether its describing an army of rabbits, sheep, \"kangas\", and emus racing to escape an outback brushfire (possibly one of the most frightening and menacing description of a landscape fire in literature) or describing General Montgomery's army advancing towards a wall of artillery fire in the North African desert (I told you this novel covers a lot of ground), McCullough has a gift for describing the big and small in brilliant, vibrant strokes.Beyond her ability to rend scenery in great detail, McCullough is also very good at presenting characters' inner psyches. I feel like McCullough is a smart observer and reporter of the human condition. Some great examples includes Fionna Cleary's tendency of favoring her boys over her sole daughter, Meg and- even further- favoring her first born son, Frank, more than the others. She does a fabulous job of blending this into the wool of story, showing how a mother's rationed love will effect each set of children differently, give them a different perspective on the world, and how that- in turn- changes other things and so on, a great domino effect. Other examples of this psychological examination include Father Ralph's intractable pride (possibly his greatest sin), or Justine's total fear of serious commitment. These are built elegantly into the plot, but one refreshing things is that McCullough is not afraid to also tell her readers exactly what the case is. She's not afraid to just come out and write a piece of exposition stating that Fionna Cleary has essentially no use or interest in having a daughter, or that Father Ralph will sell people out in his hunger for a career in the church. I think that it takes a certain boldness for writers to just come out and state something in the 3rd person omniscient, but McCullough is capable at pulling it off.Feminism: While not a feminist tract by any means (and that's good because novels that are blatantly political tend to be problematic), Thornbirds is not a story that shirks seeing its female characters developing across the generations. Spanning from proud Fionna who will never question her husband's (Paddy's) will, to Meggie who starts off as everyone's doormat but who eventually builds her own spine, to prickly Justine who is not giving up anything for anyone. McCoullough is smart enough to give each of the Cleary woman their own collection of merits and flaws. None of them are perfect, but it is heartening to see them reflect the slow progress for women since the end of the industrial era, and by the time we get to difficult/ contrary Justine (Meg's daughter) we can forgive her stubbornness because its been earned by the suffering of her mother and mother's mother.I also mentioned that this book is an anti-romance. What does that mean? Well, romance novels have a certain set of conventions that go with them, and we mostly expect them to end happily or with a tragedy that is counterweighed by immense spiritual uplift. True, it does have some hot romantic scenes between the very handsome Ralph and a beautiful Meggie and those scenes are tinged with burning desire and desperation and there is a deep sense of spiritual sacrifice (for Ralph, not so much for Meggie); however, without (hopefully) giving too much away, The Thorn Birds give us neither the happy ending nor the transcendent tragedy. Instead the end is a jigsaw puzzle of bittersweet riddles. It seems, in some ways, everyone gets what they want, but not what they need, and that's not good. So if you always get what you want and not what you need, then your victories ring hollow, or there is a lack of soul in there or something lack that. Ergo, the book bucks the conventions of romance and travels it's own enigmatic route."}, {"userName": "C\u00e9lia Loureiro", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6696620-c-lia-loureiro", "userReview": "Fora-me dito que \u201cP\u00e1ssaros Feridos\u201d era um livro sobre o amor proibido entre uma nova zelandesa e um padre. Coloc\u00e1-lo assim \u00e9 simplista demais. \u00c9 um livro que p\u00f5e em perspectiva as vidas, os pap\u00e9is, as obriga\u00e7\u00f5es, as dores de alma e os desafios que cada um est\u00e1 fadado a enfrentar.A hist\u00f3ria come\u00e7a com uma fam\u00edlia de imigrantes irlandeses com v\u00e1rias crian\u00e7as a passar dificuldades na Nova Zel\u00e2ndia, no in\u00edcio do s\u00e9c. XX. \u00c9 no seio dessa fam\u00edlia que a \u00fanica menina, Maggie, come\u00e7a a procurar o seu lugar no mundo. Nesta etapa da hist\u00f3ria surgem os primeiros pontos fortes da mesma; a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre Fee e Patsy, os pais de Maggie, e a do\u00e7ura premente entre Maggie e o irm\u00e3o mais velho, Frank.Julguei que tudo se passaria a\u00ed, nessa pequena cabana na Nova Zel\u00e2ndia, onde Maggie ajudaria sempre a m\u00e3e com as mil e uma tarefas do lar e os seus muitos irm\u00e3os cresceriam para se tornar tosquiadores como o pai. Mas ent\u00e3o os ventos chamam-nos para a Austr\u00e1lia e, desembarcados em Sydney, seguem para Drogheda, uma pr\u00f3spera fazenda de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de carneiros australiana. Como herdeiros dessa fazenda, os Cleary come\u00e7am assim a adapta\u00e7\u00e3o a uma vida com menos desafios, mas numa terra de grande beleza e de grandes durezas tamb\u00e9m. Ora enfrentam dil\u00favios, ora sobrevivem a dez anos de seca. Ora a vida animal tenta atac\u00e1-los \u2013 e inclusive arrebata-lhes vidas \u2013 ou desabam tempestades com cargas el\u00e9ctricas t\u00e3o fortes que pegam fogo a hectares de terra.\u00c9 neste cen\u00e1rio de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o que o Padre Ralph de Bricassart conhece Maggie e a sua fam\u00edlia, e se prop\u00f5e a ajud\u00e1-los com a adapta\u00e7\u00e3o e a proteger Maggie, posto que a m\u00e3e parece v\u00ea-la como algo de inc\u00f3modo e os irm\u00e3os se v\u00e3o tornando demasiado duros para olharem pelas suas necessidades. Ralph antev\u00ea na pequena Maggie o universo de brandura e generosidade em que ela mais tarde se tornar\u00e1 e assim, nas circunst\u00e2ncias mais improv\u00e1veis, nasce um amor condenado \u00e0 grandiosidade da trag\u00e9dia.O livro atravessa quase todo o s\u00e9culo XX. Do que a II Guerra Mundial significou para a Austr\u00e1lia, como possess\u00e3o brit\u00e2nica, \u00e0s muitas revolu\u00e7\u00f5es que tomaram a Europa e a mudaram, tornando-a naquilo que \u00e9 hoje. Os tempos tamb\u00e9m mudam; da av\u00f3 Fee que hesita em abandonar os corpetes e em envergar um vestido leve para os quarenta e cinco graus \u00e0 sombra da Austr\u00e1lia, \u00e0 neta Justine que \u00e9 actriz em Londres e adopta a irrever\u00eancia da recente \u201cmini-saia\u201d. Mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 somente este o ponto forte do livro \u2013 o retrato pol\u00edtico-social do mundo ao longo de todo um s\u00e9culo. O mais significativo do livro s\u00e3o, sem d\u00favida, as rela\u00e7\u00f5es interpessoais.Cada uma das personagens principais, de personalidades marcantes \u2013 Maggie, Fee, Ralph, a tia Mary, Frank, Luke, Justine, Dane, Rainer, etc., etc., etc., tem algo de t\u00e3o rico em si que nos rouba o pio. Todos eles passam por verdadeiros momentos de assombro em que se d\u00e3o conta de quem s\u00e3o realmente, do que pretendem, dos erros que cometeram, do que mais valorizam e que est\u00e3o em vias de perder. \u00c9 um grande livro sobre perseguir-se os objectivos pessoais e deixarmo-nos cegar por eles. \u00c9 um livro sobre cometer-se erros, assumir-se compromissos, choques de interesses, abdica\u00e7\u00e3o. O destino, ali t\u00e3o marcante, tudo o que vai a voltar, a vida a exigir pagamento para as benesses.J\u00e1 praticamente no final, o novo ritmo protagonizado por tr\u00eas gera\u00e7\u00f5es de mulheres Cleary comoveu-me bastante. Fee, Maggie e Justine s\u00e3o muito diferentes entre si. A primeira abra\u00e7ou o seu destino sem estrebuchar, a segunda lutou pelo que queria, mas a for\u00e7a dos costumes subjugou-a, e a terceira vive a vida ao sabor das suas vontades.Confesso que a Justine, embora tenha aparecido para a\u00ed a 75% do livro, se tornou facilmente na minha personagem favorita. Possuia a firmeza de car\u00e1cter que faltava \u00e0 Maggie, embora a pr\u00f3pria Maggie n\u00e3o seja nenhum capacho, \u00e9 um bocadinho mais conformada. N\u00e3o me admira que causasse estranheza, posto que diz o que lhe passa pela cabe\u00e7a, choca quem a rodeia e n\u00e3o procura agradar ningu\u00e9m. Comoveu-me a sua for\u00e7a \u2013 em parte apenas fachada -, o amor incondicional que dedicava ao irm\u00e3o e, mais tarde, as dificuldades que encontrou para dar-se ao homem da sua vida. Por medo de perder, de ser magoada, de querer e n\u00e3o poder ter. O amor \u00e9 fraqueza, e Justine sabe-o como ningu\u00e9m.Todas as personagens sofrem grandes desenvolvimentos, grandes mudan\u00e7as proporcionadas pelos tempos, as interac\u00e7\u00f5es e a idade. Foi agrad\u00e1vel ver esses envelhecimentos, o tempo parece ser, ele mesmo, uma das personagens habilmente arquitectadas pela autora.Como ponto fraco, que me impede de dar um cinco s\u00f3lido, aponto duas mortes de personagens important\u00edssimas para a trama, que se sucedem de um modo pouco convincente e que se d\u00e3o, tamb\u00e9m, sem motivo aparente. S\u00e3o um pouco rebuscadas, desenquadradas e inesperadas, embora tenham, claro, uma import\u00e2ncia maior para o desenrolar do enredo.\u00c9 uma saga maravilhosa sobre uma fam\u00edlia de trabalhadores, de mulheres de \u00e9poca sem a presun\u00e7\u00e3o de serem mais do que \u00e9 esperado delas, mas tamb\u00e9m sobre o quebrar dos grilh\u00f5es face aos preconceitos do passado. Um retrato de vidas, melanc\u00f3lico e, por vezes, doloroso. O livro lembra-me muito a filosofia budista, que defende que viver \u00e9 sofrer. A obra compara os actos humanos aos do p\u00e1ssaro que pressiona o pr\u00f3prio peito contra um espinho e que, enquanto sofre, solta um trinado de beleza incompar\u00e1vel. Apenas que, no caso dos humanos, sabemos o que sucede ao procurarmos o espinho, e ainda assim fazemo-lo. \"P\u00e1ssaros Feridos\" traz o conforto da inevitabilidade dos erros.Vai directamente para a minha gaveta dos favoritos."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "I really enjoy epic stories and sagas, big sweeping stories that enmesh the reader in the characters and their lives, and make the reader more than just a bystander watching the action, but a sort of participant. We want things to go a certain way, we want things to go well, because we care about the characters, and we have invested our hopes in them. Colleen McCullough has an almost magical skill in making her characters real and believable and true. That is what I love most about reading, and why I love certain authors above others. Where another author's character may be interesting and dynamic and exciting, they are still just a character. McCullough, and a few other authors, has the ability to make her characters, fictional though they may be, reach out of the pages and touch us. The characters she creates no longer feel like words on a page; they follow me around, pry their way into my dreams, make me wonder how they are spending their days when I'm not able to read about them. I love when I can just plunge into a book and live in it... To that end, McCullough even seemed to make Australia itself a living, breathing character. It's described beautifully, and is as unpredictable as any human character she's introduced here.This is the third McCullough book that I've read, and I feel like she must have spent an inordinate amount of her life just observing life and people. She brings us the stories of the people she creates, but, even though we're following an omniscient narrator, we can only see, feel and hear so much of our subject's lives. We can only reach so far into their hearts for the mysteries that elude us, because, like real people, they don't have open-book hearts and minds. But it feels like we're able to see into their souls, because McCullough understands humanity itself, and presents us with general truths that feel like intimate secrets. This story centers around the Cleary family and what comes to be their farm Drogheda. We meet Meggie Cleary as a 4 year old birthday girl, and then follow her through six decades of life, love and loss. Her family is a strange, introverted male-centric one. Meggie is the only girl in a rather large clan of brothers: Frank, Bob, Jack, Hughie, Stuart, Hal, James and Patrick. She learns early to be self-reliant, because in her family there is not a lot of use for girls. Her mother is very closed-mouthed, very closed-off, and works her fingers to the bone to keep the household running, because her father has very distinct ideas about the differences between the sexes - housework and child-rearing is woman's domain only, and farming and work is man's domain only. The two are not to mix or cross paths. This is not to say that Paddy Cleary was a bad or harsh man, because he was not, but he just had certain ideas of how life is, and his word was law as the Man of the House. Their lives ease somewhat after moving to Australia, but with the move comes a new set of struggles. Meggie meets and loves Father Ralph, the Catholic priest in the area. At ten, it's an innocent, adoring love, which provides her with attention that she's neglected in other areas of her life. Meggie is never taught about puberty, or where babies come from, or many other things that girls need to know. She's generally kept in the back hall closet of life. Not maliciously, but because in the Cleary family, a daughter has to fend for herself. Boys are the goal, because boys are the workers, the backbone of the family, and the genes that allow the name and lineage to be carried on. Because of Meggie's neglect, Father Ralph has the responsibility of teaching her the things that a mother should. As she grows up, the innocent love she holds for Father Ralph turns into more, and causes both parties to struggle, because what we want most is often what is the most forbidden. Father Ralph is probably my favorite character here. I am not Catholic, and a lot of the Catholic faith is a mystery to me. But his struggles of conscience and faith, which force him to choose between the love he feels and the vows he made, in my mind make him the most interesting character of them all. I think that probably most priests have this crisis at some point in their lives... do they regret their decision to forfeit their manhood for the priesthood? Are they strong enough to resist temptation? I'm glad that we got to see things here from both sides - not only Father Ralph's struggle, but Meggie's struggles as well. There was a lot in this book that reminded me of other classic literature. Father Ralph's struggles and Meggie's desire for him brought to mind Hester and Rev. Dimmesdale from \"The Scarlet Letter\". Justine, Meggie's daughter with Luke O'Neill, reminded me quite a bit of Jo March from \"Little Women\" in her feminist, proud, ambitious and take no prisoners approach to life. But in both cases, the similarities are only surface level, because these characters are far less perfect, less romantic, and more real than those they bring to mind from other books. There is more than a little heartbreak in this book and I will admit that I shed a few tears. But one thing that rather grated on my nerves was that I could always tell when tragedy was about to strike. It seemed that for every loss, there was a hopeful build-up so that the fall would be that much greater. I felt that it was obvious and I rolled my eyes more than once because of it. So that's why I've taken off a star for this book. But that being said, the depictions of the reactions to the losses were very real and honest. I just wish that the red herring ploy wasn't so obvious. Anyway, I did truly enjoy this book, as I have enjoyed the other McCulloughs that I've read. I do plan on reading more of her books in the future, and would certainly recommend this one."}, {"userName": "T\u00e2nia F", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4623100-t-nia-f", "userReview": "Adorei. Adorei. Adorei. \u00c9 um livro que prende da primeira \u00e0 \u00faltima p\u00e1gina. \u00c9 uma hist\u00f3ria sobre sofrimento, persist\u00eancia e resili\u00eancia. Retrata a hist\u00f3ria de uma fam\u00edlia, inicialmente residente na Nova Zel\u00e2ndia, mas que cedo parte para a Austr\u00e1lia (e como h\u00e1 tanto tempo eu anseio por visitar a Austr\u00e1lia...). A\u00ed relata essencialmente a vida rural, de muita poeira e ambiente cinzento, longas extens\u00f5es de terra \u00e1rida, com condi\u00e7\u00f5es meteorol\u00f3gicas extremas, intercalando \u00e9pocas de profundas secas com enormes cheias. Quando ao enredo, \u00e9 constitu\u00eddo por personagem de personalidade forte, orgulhosas e que tentam superar as adversidades de forma bastante introspectiva. Escrito num estilo soberbo, com um sentido de humor sofisticado. Pessoalmente identifiquei-me com algumas caracter\u00edsticas da personagem Justine, especialmente com as suas d\u00favidas e inseguran\u00e7as. Foi bom poder mergulhar nesta hist\u00f3ria, ao ponto de ansiar sofregamente por todos os momentos livres, para poder discorrer mais algumas p\u00e1ginas. Em muitos momentos, n\u00e3o resisti a saltitar umas p\u00e1ginas \u00e0 frente para bisbilhotar o que se ia passar e \u00e9 algo que nunca fa\u00e7o, mas a curiosidade era mais que muita. Ler assim compulsivamente \u00e9 bom, permite-nos sentir aquela hist\u00f3ria em pleno. Felizmente nem todos os livros me encantam dessa forma, em parte ainda bem, sen\u00e3o deixava de ter vida para al\u00e9m do trabalho e leitura. Tenho muita vontade de ler mais livros desta autora, pois a sua escrita e capacidade de contar uma hist\u00f3ria, surpreendeu-me muito. Tamb\u00e9m estou certa de que vou querer voltar a ler este livro.Deixo aqui excertos do in\u00edcio e fim do livro:\"Existe uma lenda acerca de um p\u00e1ssaro que s\u00f3 canta uma vez na vida, com mais suavidade que qualquer outra criatura sobre a Terra. A partir do momento em que deixa o ninho, come\u00e7a a procurar um espinheiro, e s\u00f3 descansa quando o encontra. Depois, cantando entre os galhos selvagens, empala-se no ac\u00faleo mais agudo e comprido. E, morrendo, sublima a pr\u00f3pria agonia e solta um canto mais belo que o da cotovia e o do rouxinol. Um canto superlativo, cujo pre\u00e7o \u00e9 a exist\u00eancia. Mas o mundo inteiro p\u00e1ra para ouvi-lo, e Deus sorri no c\u00e9u. Pois o melhor s\u00f3 se adquire \u00e0 custa de um grande sofrimento... Pelo menos \u00e9 o que diz a lenda.[...]O p\u00e1ssaro com o espinho cravado no peito segue uma lei imut\u00e1vel; impelido por ela, n\u00e3o sabe o que \u00e9 empalar-se, e morre cantando. No instante em que o espinho penetra, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nele consci\u00eancia do morrer futuro; limita-se a cantar e canta at\u00e9 que n\u00e3o lhe sobra vida para emitir uma \u00fanica nota. Mas n\u00f3s, quando enfiamos os espinhos no peito, n\u00f3s sabemos, compreendemos. E assim mesmo fazemo-lo.\"A meio do livro, tal lenda \u00e9 esmiu\u00e7ada da seguinte forma:\"Cada um de n\u00f3s tem dentro de si alguma coisa que n\u00e3o pode ser negada, ainda que nos fa\u00e7a gritar, gritar, gritar, at\u00e9 ao fim. Somos o que somos, e pronto. Como a velha lenda celta do p\u00e1ssaro com o espinho no peito que canta at\u00e9 morrer, porque precisa de faz\u00ea-lo, porque \u00e9 levado a isso. Podemos saber que vamos errar antes at\u00e9 de cometer o erro, mas o conhecimento de n\u00f3s mesmos n\u00e3o afecta nem altera o resultado. Cada qual entoa o seu c\u00e2ntico, convencido de que \u00e9 o mais maravilhoso que o mundo j\u00e1 ouviu. N\u00e3o v\u00eas? Cri\u00e1mos os nossos espinhos e nunca nos detivemos para avaliar o custo. A \u00fanica coisa que podemos fazer \u00e9 sofrer a dor e dizer intimamente que valeu a pena.\""}, {"userName": "Shobhit Sharad", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34286188-shobhit-sharad", "userReview": "I wanted to be impressed by this book, after reading so many positive reviews, and I am impressed, but not to the extent that would justify to me its heaps of praises.The story was good. Though a quite many important parts of the story were rushed up, I liked reading about Australia, and the changing world along with the changing story. The thing I disliked most about the book was that many of its characters' decisions were counter-intuitive, and it happened a lot of times.Except for the protagonists, most characters were likeable. In fact, in the beginning and at the end, I quite enjoyed reading Meggie Cleary. But father Ralph de Bricassart was, according to me, such an impractical character, that in my mind he was hardly human (something like this with Dane too). On the other hand, I quite enjoyed Justine, Rain, Fee, Luke, Frank, and a few others.The best part about the book was the writing. Even at some too-tiring pages I was able to hold on because of the beautiful way in which Collen McCullough has written. Some of my favourite bits are here.\u201cAnd gradually his memory slipped a little, as memories do, even those with so much love attached to them; as if there is an unconscious healing process within the mind which mends up in spite of our desperate determination never to forget.\u201d\"When a man's hands are callused you know he's honest.\"\"Time ceased to tick and began to flow, washed over him until it had no meaning, only a depth of dimension more real than time.\"\"Maybe senility's a mercy shown to those who couldn't face retrospection.\"End of the story is, I liked the book but didn't

Everything about the story itself just felt flat and clumsy to me. The only character I found remotely interesting was Justine, and the only romance I cared about was between Justine and Rainer. And that was only in the last seventy-five or so pages. Reading the rest of the book just felt like a chore. I hated Ralph. He seemed manipulative and sketchy and at the same time didn't really feel like a real human being. I was super creeped out by his \"love\" for Meggie. Meggie herself I didn't like at all. She seemed so vapid, and most of her dreams consisted of marriage and babies, babies, babies. Urghhhhh.The dialogue felt stilted and overly formal, even for the time period in which the book took place. The story didn't feel at all real to me. Despite the religious aspects of the book (Ralph is a freaking priest for God's sake) it didn't make me think about religion or spirituality or Catholicism in any meaningful way. So yeah, I'm quite disappointed with this book.

Atentem no primeiro par\u00e1grafo da obra:\"Existe uma lenda acerca de um p\u00e1ssaro que s\u00f3 canta uma vez na vida, com mais suavidade do que qualquer outra criatura sobre a Terra. A partir do momento em que deixa o ninho, come\u00e7a a procurar um espinheiro, e s\u00f3 descansa quando o encontra. Depois, cantando entre os galhos selvagens, empala-se no ac\u00faleo mais agudo e mais comprido.

Ainda que fic\u00e7\u00e3o hist\u00f3rica n\u00e3o seja dos g\u00e9neros liter\u00e1rios que mais aprecio, tenho uma certa tend\u00eancia para adorar (e at\u00e9 delirar) com enredos focados numa mesma fam\u00edlia.

Romantic fiction - I used to think - is fluff for bimbos. Since I consider myself literate and intelligent (yeah, really!) I wouldn't touch this sort of book. Bizarrely, I was not ashamed to read even the most extreme - and extremely inane - crime fiction. (\"After all, we all need to relax now and then.\" Hmmmph!)Well, now I'm older and wiser and more inclined to read books for enjoyment than for the pleasure of imagining how people will be impressed when they scan my bookshelves, and since I have realised that every crime that can be imagined has been done to death already (sorry!), I have started to read books I wouldn't have touched in the past. In other words, chic lit, romantic fiction, historical fiction and the like.And I've been discovering plenty of good reads in the process. This is one of them. It's a good story that catches your interest right from the start. It provides insights into the difficult lives of people on a big Australian farm in the last century (the 20th, I mean). As a love story it is engaging. The characters are memorable. The writing is not bad. The plot is interesting and the structure is excellent. Not a book to win literary prizes, perhaps, but a far less silly way to pass a few hours pleasantly than reading psycho-killer nonsense.In any case, it was a famous book in its day, and I'm glad that now at last I am in a position to pass judgement on the book, rather than its readers."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7555122-laura", "userReview": "692 pages of a wonderful family saga.

From the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree, and does not rest until it has found one. Then, singing among the savage branches, it impales itself upon the longest, sharpest spine. And, dying, it rises above its own agony to out-carol the lark and the nightingale. One superlative song, existence the price. But the whole world stills to listen, and God in His heaven smiles. For the best is only bought at the cost of great pain . . . Or so says the legend. And there sets the setting for The Thorn Birds by Colleen McCullough; a quest in search of true love but faced with a powerful, forbidden passion that only grows stronger and more painful as time goes by . The Thorn Birds, a true literary classic in its own right, was absolutely absorbing and compelling as you journey through three generations (1915 - 1969) of the Cleary family from the hills of New Zealand and the dusty lands of the Australian Outback to the grand cathedrals of the Vatican in Rome. The emotionally gripping and compelling writing is one of the purest examples of purple prose executed to perfection in my honorable opinion. It had me spellbound for a good 5 days as I read through it only to face a heart-rending climactic finale. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get lost in a novel filled with captivating characters who face five decades of family tragedies, harsh realities, forbidden love, and ultimate self-discovery.One thing I must note is that I am glad I waited to read this book when I did because I feel it takes an open mind and relaxed moral compass to appreciate the sincere, tasteful, and beautiful love story infused in this novel. Had I read this in my teens or even twenties, I think I would have gasped an outrage of blasphemy and sacrilege, but at this point in my life I can set the actions apart from the roles of the characters and see them as mere humans with understandable needs for love and affection despite their position in life. Ralph and Meggie's account is a timeless story because it deals with forbidden love and wanting what we cannot have, which can easily resonate to many readers, plain and simple.It was heartbreaking to see history repeat itself where the Cleary women put their lives on hold, yearning for a man they cannot have and neglecting their children along the way, while at the same time you witness the men of the family allowing their lives to drift by without a true quest to find something more meaningful for their lives besides just working the land.Overall, I was immediately drawn into the Outback and the lives of the Clearys and towards the end of my journey, I found myself resisting the closure of this book. The Thorn Birds has definitely found a spot on my favorites list, as I loved the story, the turbulent cast of characters and beautifully descriptive scenes in this book.

The love between Father Ralph and Meggie bothered me; it didn't seem real enough and the age difference and the circumstances in which they met (she being a child at the time) didn't sit well with me either.
