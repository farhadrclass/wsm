The drawings look so good, I want to eat them!Hank (11): 3.6 stars. I like the imagination in this story.Lyra (10): 4 stars. Good children's book! Lots of imaginative ideas, and it makes me hungry. Yuck to the moldy fruitcake, though. I liked the map in the back!Dave: 3 stars. :) Lady Pancake and Sir French Toast star. Busy, goofy art, not my favorite style. The story is a mystery: What IS that stinky stench in the kitchen?! Lots of hijinks. To help keep track (in sort of Clue boardgames fashion), illustrator Brendan Kearney includes a map including Taco Bridge, Trifle Tower, Marshmallow Coast, Applesauce River, things like that.

How would you like to decay?\u201d ---Inspector Croissant\tSomething foul to the nose can really catch children\u2019s attention. The Case of the Stinky Stench is the second picture book to involve the characters Lady Pancake and Sir French Toast and does a great job of entertaining and educating through numerous ways, the biggest being fun. Of course Funk and Kearney don\u2019t only utilize a stinky fridge mystery to communicate lessons; they also utilize interplay of verbal and visual aspects to convey information and stimulation to catch children\u2019s attention.\tThe lessons in The Case of the Stinky Stench are about cooperation, neglect, forgetfulness, and cleanliness that are taught through animated food inside a refrigerator. Inspector Croissant is on a mission, and is accompanied by Lady Pancake and Sir French Toast who journey through the refrigerator in search of the stinky offender. All other food characters inside the refrigerator are also offended and support their search. When the stinker turns out to be an eight-month-old fruitcake who needs help, other food characters give the fruitcake a wash and shave. A nice lesson is given because instead of condemning him, they help him and make a difference. The case is solved and the refrigerator is fresh once more. \tOne way Funk and Kearney use verbal and visual aspect to capture children\u2019s attention is through first deciding to create a picture book. As a specialist on children\u2019s literature and professor of English at the University of Winnipeg, Nodelman explains \u201cChildren respond more readily to pictures than to words\u201d (1). Picture books have been used for educational purposes since their very beginning. Pictures seem to \u201cclassify texts because they can indeed communicate effortlessly\u201d (6). Most children enjoy looking at pictures and including a story about them captures their attention. There is more to picture books than just pictures with words however.\tLanguage and placement of words make a difference on how children perceive each page and the whole book experience. Funk creates rhyming sentences and fun characters with names such as Inspector Croissant, Barron Von Waffle, Miss Steak, and of course Miss Pancake and Sir French Toast. He also is creative with areas such as Mount Everbean, Onion Ring Cave, Applesauce River, and Corn Chowder Lake. Where sentences are placed isn\u2019t haphazard. Sentences in the tale jump all over. They go from the bottom on one page to the top of the next, which really creates a feeling of action. There are pages with sentences at the top and bottom of the same page and even pages without words too. Goldsmith, in her work \u201cLearning from Illustrators: Factors in the Design of Illustrated Books for Middle School Children\u201d suggest that how pictures and words are placed in a picture book make a difference (111-21). \tThe placement of illustrations makes a difference in how children perceive each page and the whole book experience too. Kearney uses a media that seems similar to water color, which creates a lighter feel instead of an intense one. Each picture covers complete pages, which tends to focus attention on action and emotion (Nodelman 51-52). There aren\u2019t\u2019 boxes for sentences or illustrations. None of the pages are framed, which creates a more thorough experience, a view from within. Some pages however, do offer a picture within a picture that is boxed, such as on page five where Inspector Croissant realizes he must solve the case. A purple circle frame surrounds him. This creates a feeling of constraint that must be broken in order to solve the case. The color purple here could cause a feeling of darkness or of mystery (Nodelman 63). Most illustrations are a spread where one picture takes up two pages and add to the dramatic tension. When Funk and Kearny offer a last page that opens down, offering a small poster-size glimpse of inside the fridge as depicted in Inspector Croissant\u2019s journey, a mini refrigerator is brought to life. Actual parts of the inside of a refrigerator are never shown though. To do so might go too far and break the imaginative land Funk and Kearney bring to life as opposed to the reality of a commonly neglected household product.\tFunk and Kearney incorporate lessons of cooperation can solve problems, and stink can be prevented through regular cleaning through using a lively picture book with strategically placed words and illustrations. Though recommended for ages 4-8 and Kindergarten through third grade, adults may enjoy the story too, or at least be made to wonder when the last time they cleaned out the refrigerator was.
