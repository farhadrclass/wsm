Okay, so here\u2019s my little confession: I picked this up expecting Perfect Chemistry, with a side order of fairy tales and 150% more depth. One would assume (har har) that I\u2019d learned not to make assumptions in my thirty-some years of life, and yet here we are. This book was so utterly different than what I was expecting. I didn\u2019t read any reviews prior to starting and I think that was actually a mistake. I really should have paid a bit more attention to that cover: just look at that pretty purple rose\u2026wilting in the frost\u2026with spots of blood on it. *shudder* Upon finishing this book, I was so completely at a loss; I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. I felt like I\u2019d just walked into what I thought was a kid\u2019s petting zoo, only to discover that it was actually a baby animal slaughterhouse. And I don\u2019t want to spoil this book for anyone\u2026but\u2026I think that anyone who\u2019s going to attempt this book needs to know the following:a) There are people out there who grow up in horrific, abusive situations and yet they survive and learn to cope. They find help and learn to accept who they are.This book is not about those people.b) There are kind, patient people who, through the setting of boundaries, can have healthy non-codependent relationships with severely damaged people and help them to get through.This book is most definitely not about those people. This book is about Anna, a good girl. A girl raised with every advantage. A girl who feels trapped by her own inexperience.\u201cWho was she? A girl inside a bubble. The daughter of Magnus and Linda Leemann, from a nice district of Griefswald, from a house of blue air. High school student in her last year, musician, English au pair to be. Gitta\u2019s squeaky-clean little lamb. No. She was someone who didn\u2019t know yet who she was or would be.\u201dAnd this book is about Abel, a mystery. He\u2019s an older brother, a drug dealer, an abandoned kid, a self-destructive person, and a storyteller. Anna is intrigued by him; she wants to figure him out. She wants to know something outside her bubble of blue air, so she follows him one day. She\u2019s surprised when the scary-looking Abel picks up a little girl in a pink coat, and she\u2019s even more surprised when he begins to tell her a haunting, beautiful fairy tale. Anna is captivated but she\u2019s soon discovered eavesdropping. Abel is thorny and protective of the little girl \u2013 his sister, Micha \u2013 but Anna is persistent. Soon she\u2019s becoming involved in their lives \u2013 in Abel\u2019s desperate attempt to keep his sister by his side even though he\u2019s a minor, in Micha\u2019s questions about their missing mother. Anna is determined to help, even as Abel tries to push her away. But even as he\u2019s pushing her away, she\u2019s becoming a main character in his stories.\u201c\u2019Your roses are already starting to wilt,\u2019 the sea lion said to the rose girl. 'Not only where I tore them but everywhere else on your body, too. They will wither. And you will freeze in the cold wind.\u2019\u201dThis book is bleak. I\u2019m not actually sure that I knew the definition of that word before reading this book. Okay, that\u2019s probably an exaggeration. However, I must say that while I am quite often that reviewer who cries, \u201cToo neat! Too happy!\u201d this was probably the first time that I ever wanted to whimper, \u201cToo dark\u201d and then back away slowly\u2026and huddle in a corner. This book really, really got under my skin and not always in a good way. It made me feel angry and hopeless. The relationship portrayed here is twisted and sick. It made me physically ill to read about it but I can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s realistic. I hated Abel and I hated Anna, but I related to them too: Abel and his need to keep everyone at a distance, Anna and her cloak of torn love. And I love the idea of two messed up, broken kids who can only truly connect in a fairy tale, but never in their real lives. I love the idea that somewhere inside a hopelessly damaged person, there lies a small, untouched, sacred place \u2013 a place for fairy tales.However, I think that in the end I loved the idea of this book more than the finished product. Abel is a bit too much a cipher. He never feels fully fleshed out as a character, in my opinion. He\u2019s proud and self-contained, but I never really felt the pain underneath all that, and I needed to. I needed to be able to relate to him in some more tangible way. In a few places he even feels a bit like a stereotype. It's possible that my own preconceived notions about this book colored my thoughts about him a little too much. Perhaps Abel would come through more clearly to me on a re-read? If I could stand one.The narration is also a little odd. It\u2019s third person, and hovers over Anna for about 95% of the book, but then takes occasional little detours to follow Gitta (Anna\u2019s friend), Bertil (another friend), Abel, or Soren (a teacher). When we\u2019re with Anna, the narrator is intimate and free with information, but when we\u2019re with anyone else\u2026it becomes a vague, tight-fisted liar. It feels a little too much like reader manipulation \u2013 like the author\u2019s blatant attempt to keep everything a mystery until the very end. However, I just adore Antonia Michaelis\u2019 writing. She writes beautiful, evocative, stunning prose. I highlighted so many passages. I'm not really sure how readers will react to this book. I'm having a difficult time with my own reaction to this book. It\u2019s a dark, difficult (yet beautiful) read. That being said, I really want you all to read it, because I desperately need someone to have this conversation with right now:\u201cCould you believe that he\u2026?\u201d\u201cNO. That was INSANE.\u201d\u201cAnd then she\u2026\u201d\u201cOMG, don\u2019t even get me started.\u201dSo get to it!Perfect Musical PairingWe Are Augustines - Book of JamesThe theme of this song is a bit of a MAJOR spoiler so I\u2019m not really going to discuss it. But this quote (from the lyrics) makes me really emotional about this book:\u201cStorm clouds began to form in his head and crisscrossed his mind like a restless angry ocean And the howling of hardship and heartache kneeled and grinned in his faceHe stood there in his shoes unable to move Kid I drove all night here to tell you I love you\u201dAlso seen on The Readventurer."}, {"userName": "Kristalia ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5705623-kristalia", "userReview": "[ murderer as well, that he killed all of those people while i suspected Bertil.....I just don't know..... he had the reasons, and he did all of that for Micha... but it doesn't give you right to kill people who stand in your way.

He is a young man hiding an ugly reality behind pretty words and magical happenings.In order to find out what he is hiding, we are forced to slowly watch as the layers of his true self are revealed, one ugly layer at a time. Secrets are the only method of survival in a world where you can count on no one but yourself. Secrets are the only choice you have when you must protect the life of an innocent.Enter Anna. Sheltered, clueless Anna. She has no idea of the darkness and danger outside of her safe little world.\n\nIt's late, Anna...they'll be waiting for you, at home...in that house where the air is always blue...they'll be worried.\n\nA chance meeting between the school's drug dealer and an innocent, sheltered student came about because of a lost doll. Had Anna not found the doll, she would have carried on her life as usual. There would be no danger, no mystery, no killing for her to know about. One might say that finding the doll was the worst thing that could have happened to her. I would disagree.Abel is a broken human being. He's broken to the point of ill repair, yet Anna still sees something in him that's worth saving. As we see Abel through Anna's eyes, we are shown just how much a person will endure in order to spare a life so precious to him - the life of a tiny little girl in a pink jacket.Abel and Anna bond through time shared as Abel spins wonderful fairytales into existence for his younger sister. Real life becomes the backdrop for the fantasy. Characters in reality become characters in the story. A mystery starts to unfold as characters in the story become bigger players in crimes which start taking place in the real world. Who is the killer? Why does Abel seem to have so much to hide? Why are other people interested in what Abel and Anna are up to? I can't divulge much without going into spoiler territory. The Storyteller is so beautifully written. The depth of character and layers of detail are heart-breakingly intricate. After I finished, I was left with a few different emotions. Anger and sadness were probably the two most prominent, but I can't say that I have any regrets reading this book. I had a hard time putting my reader down because the story of Abel and Anna was such a pull. As for the character flaws...I suppose I should address those. Both Abel and Anna disappointed me in a way because of their actions, yet I felt as if their actions made them more real. Abel was abused, so he had no other experience to draw from in learning how to interact with others. Anna had an empty but satisfactory life and she craved more than her own existence inside of a pretty box. Abel was able to give her something she'd never had before and because of this, she was quick to forgive at times when others wouldn't. Right or wrong, I understood why."}, {"userName": "Soumi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6833452-soumi", "userReview": "Just a tiny little painThree days of heavy rain,Three days of sunlight,Everything will be alright\nA good girl, a bad boy, a deadly fairytale that might come true, in truth life is no fairy tale.Anna was fascinated by Abel, school\u2019s moody drug dealer. When she discovered Abel was actually caring for his little sister Micha, alone, trying to protect her from her abusive father, Anna was more drawn to him. In spite of friends\u2019 warning Anna started hanging out with Abel and found herself engulfed by the fairytale Able used to tell Micha. A fairytale about a little orphan cliff queen with heart of pure diamond, hunted by the hunter who wants possess her diamond heart. A foretold fairytale, woven the characters from real life and when the characters turned up dead in real, who knew a fairytale might come true. Was Anna in love with a murderer?Story unlike anything I have read, characters unlike any one I have ever seen, The Storyteller stole my heart. Not many books had made me cry, neither had I crowned many books with the title of \u201cAll time favorite\u201d, but The Storyteller was spellbound.A parallel journey of a fairytale and truth of reality, both were mirror image of each other. Experience of reading The Storyteller will always be alive in my memory.When I was finished with the book, I was speechless; my heart was shattered with pain, I couldn\u2019t sleep that night. It took me several days to collect my thoughts and brought them together in a piece of paper, though I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll not be able to express my feeling in few words.The StorytellerAbel, my storyteller, you were the heart of the book, without you the story has no existence. His character was layered like black and white aligning the lighter and dark shades of Abel\u2019s life. I was lost into his blue eyes, immersed in his ravishing fairytale just like Anna. Initially I thought him to be another bad boy but I immediately found myself attached to him from the very moment he ran to Micha, hold her in his arm and spin her around in the air, I found a passionate and caring boy living inside his rough shell. Abel is a character worthy of notice, very remarkable and a brilliant narrator of an enchanting fairytale. The Rosegirl\n\u201cPart of her\u2014unreasonable Anna\u2014still loved him. Maybe she would never stop loving him.\u201d\nIf Abel was the heart, Anna was his heart beat. The kind and selfless girl, soft like a rose petal, but her path to Abel\u2019s life was a path of thrones. I felt emphasized with her, adapted her love, her pain and her concerns as my own. Experiencing the story from Anna\u2019s point felt like I was physically present here but mentally I was with her watching Abel, suffering for him and falling for him more and more. Love Is Red, So Is Blood\n'He pulled her close and held her for a moment, so tight she could feel every single bone in his body. And somewhere between them, she felt his heart beating, fast and nervous. Hunted.\nThe storyteller was a wistful love story without the three words \u201cI love you\u201d. The affection and warmth between Anna and Abel made my heart beat fast and I stared to bite my nails off to the ultimate point of love, a heartrending bitter sweet romance that will haunt your thoughts.\n\u201cAll you saw and felt was your love for him. You were wearing this love like a cloak, safe and warm, you thought \u2026 and he tore it apart.\u201d\nWith presence of warm feelings and wet kisses in winter, The Storyteller is painful yet very touching romance mingled with series of murder and mysteries. Moving in a slow pace yet tense, the author was successful to hold me hypnotized.Slowly unfolding the mysteries, when the book led me to the unexpected ultimate revelation, my heart sank deeper and deeper; I found my thoughts bleeding and murmuring under my breath why this have to end like this, there should have been other ways but I understood the \"easy way out\". The writing was lyrical and mesmerizing, with wonderful words. I had my attention fixated on the pages as though by a spell, The Storyteller was truly a different and beautiful example of traditional writing style in modern literature. Only I can say reading The Storyteller was wonderful journey for me. A heart wrenching love, secrets and deaths, The Storyteller is one of most extraordinarily great novel of the year."}, {"userName": "Yonaily ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22496761-yonaily", "userReview": "FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCKI HATE this book.But I also LOVE it.FUCK.

In love, there is no rationality.\"\nThis quote, to me, says it all in this story. It's a story will stay with you long after you're done. I'm still thinking and talking about it to whoever will listen.  Seventeen year old Anna finds a doll, underneath a couch in the student lounge. When Abel, the well-known drug dealer of the school, claims the doll belongs to his six-year old sister, Anna is curious, and ends up following Abel to see if it's true. When Anna sees the love, and affection on the face of Abel as his picks his sister, Micha, up from school, she finds herself intrigued. Anna continues to follow them to a student dining hall. She sits close but undetected, listening as Abel tells a fairytale that completely entrances Anna. Anna's presence soon becomes known, and she sits, and listens with them to the fairytale the rest of the afternoon. Anna soon finds out that Abel is caring for his sister alone. The whereabouts of their mother is unknown. He is scared that the authorities will take Micha away from him because he is not yet eighteen, and place her in foster care. The fairytale Abel continues to tell, seems to mirror real life. Warning signs flash to Anna when some of the people that die in the fairytale, also die in real life. Could her storyteller be responsible, or are other sinister people involved? As this is going on, Anna and Abel find themselves drawn to each other and you wonder, right along with Anna, is this going to work out? Let me tell you, this is not my normal, sweet, vanilla-type book, with a nicely wrapped up ending. This book is messy, beyond messy. Abel and Anna's relationship is sweet and heart-breaking. He does some things and you think: I don't know if I can get over that. Then something else happens, and your heart melts again. You really want things to work out for these two. This is interlaced with all kinds of HORRIBLE! That being said, this story was beautiful. Taking place in the middle of winter felt like the perfect setting, there was a quiet, chilling, and intimate quality to this story. This was originally written in German but the lovely prose was not lost in translation, in my opinion. I don't know why but I loved this quote: Anna was standing in front of the glass leading out to the fading light of the garden when her mother came home. She'd been staring at her own figure reflected in the glass: the outline of her narrow shoulders, her long dark hair----a see-through person full of winter shrubs. See, it's of no use to you to read that, I just liked it. So if anyone wants to read a brilliant story that will completely DESTROY you in the end, this is for you! Thank you, Sam, for this recommendation. I was crying for hours, but yes, we are still friends.

No. She was someone who didn\u2019t know yet who she was or would be.\u201dMaybe is that motherly instinct, we girls have, to fix something broken that made Anna get involved with Abel and Micha, maybe it was the amazing talent Abel had for telling beautiful stories based in an ugly reality, or maybe it was the need of adventure \u2026 what ever the reason was, Anna took an important role in the story, in their lives, and she was so involved in the swirl of fire that was Abel and Micha\u2019s lives that it sucked her up completely, it consumed her ... and she got burned \u2026 AbelOh boy \u2026 where do I start?

And he\u2019s also so messed up that he makes bad choices, he has all that rage inside, he\u2019s self-destructive, but also loyal, he\u2019s violent, and tender, angry and intimidating, he\u2019s afraid and he has hope and he had to grow up quickly and \u2026 and \u2026 and he\u2019s blind to the other options around him, he\u2019s vindictive \u2026 and \u2026 Just trying to figure him out drains me emotionally. And that\u2019s the thing with this book, it is a roller coaster of emotions and it challenged my moral and ethical principles, I was so immersed in the story that I found myself rooting for \u201cunreasonable Anna\u201d, I wanted her to make a bad choice, I was justifying Abel\u2019s actions \u2026 and \u2026 NO \u2026 just \u2026 NO \u2026 as he said:\n\u201dThere is a reason for what happened. I can\u2019t be forgiven so I am not asking you for forgiveness. We lost each other, and we will never find each other again.\u201d\nYeah!! That's what I say about the boat house scene!!!!By the end of the book, I was a mess \u2026 I was trying to cope and process and order my thoughts \u2026 this book was recommended to my by a friend, when she finished, she called me and said something like \u201cI just finished \u2018The Storyteller\u2019 and I need to go out, let\u2019s go for coffee because \u2026 I need to process this\u201d \u2026.. not her exact words, but you get the idea. Well \u2026 sadly I couldn\u2019t go for coffee with her, but after I finished reading \u2026 I called her and told her \u201cI get it, I do \u2026. WHY DID YOU MAKE ME READ THIS DRAMATIC BOOK!!?? WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU!!?? THE PAIN!! SO MUCH PAIN!!\u201d Really, my reaction at the end was something like \u2026Now you are probably asking yourself ... should I read this??? YES!!!

Just a tiny little pain ..... An hour and a half has passed , and the only sensible thing that i've done in that past hour is cry . Cry , because that seemed the only way to get rid of the pain . Pain , that this soul stiring , questioning your beliefs on love and forgiveness kind of feel this book leaves you with . I would be lying if i said that i've heard or read this kind of a story before , and i would also be lying if i told that i have cried this way for too long before . Never before have i felt an emotion so strong , so over whelming that i know i could move a mountain or control the waves of the ocean with it . The storyteller is a book with so many riled up different kinds of emotions , that i felt that its really upto the reader to either submerge oneself in the vast depthness of this book or just skim the surface . Either way it is impossible to walk away unscathed . A thorn of pain , a sprinkle of laughter , a touch of innocence , an hint of unspoken love , a trickle of tear , a spark of anger , its bound to touch you , bound to make you feel good or bad depending on the aura around the story . Cover speak : Absolutely and whole heartedly love this cover . For me its meaning were simple , the rose there being the sign/symbol of love and hope . But one must not forget that along with the roses comes its thorns . Along with love comes its share of pain and heatbreaks . And sometimes hope crumbles too , giving way to agony and despair . The droplets of blood around are just that . One could also say that it symbolises 'Tainted love ' . Why do i call it tainted ? Well you will just have to read the story and find out . Honestly , the blurb of this book already talks about what this book and its story line and everything is ... but , in no freaking ways does it prepare you for what you are about to get into once you actually start reading it . It basically gives you moments and memories , that tends to linger with you even after you've long finished reading this masterpiece . When an author manages to bring out the most complexes of human nature by spinning a tale of loss , love , pain and sacrifice then i believe that author has managed to win and conquer the hearts of all those who've read their work . And Antonia Michaelis is one such author . She apeaks of the human nature , the human trait to protect someone near and dear more than protecting ones own life , to love someone deeply without conditions , to follow dreams to secure someone else's future more than yours , to kill or be killed without hesitation and regrets . All these above mentioned points are just a part of this amazing story . Another very inspiring point of this book was Abels story telling technique . How easily it could be called a work of imagination yet its full of reality and truth . Oh my i'm totally in love with the characters and this book ... Even now as i sit here and type out this review , i cant help but get all teary eyed .. * Sobs *  My playlist for this book  :1) Massive Attack - Paradise Circus . ( Overview of the entire book ) 2) Florence and the Machine - Blinding . ( When Micah calls up Anna , telling her Abel's in trouble and Anna runs out to help them )3) Deftones - Minerva ( Abel's song ) 4) Cider Sky - Northern Lights ( Abel and Anna's intimate moments ) 5) Massive Attack - Risingson ( In most of the scenes at the club ) 6) Paper Route - Dancing on our Graves ( Abels song for Anna after their night at the boathouse )7) Sade - King of Sorrow ( Anna's song for Abel ) 8) Kings of leon - Closer9) Florence and the Machine - Cosmic love 10) Civil Wars - Poison and wine ( For the end )I would seriously recommend this book to everyone !!

(EDIT: With more details)There are two kinds of a good book: those that you enjoy but will soon forget, and those that will linger in your memory forever. \"The Storyteller\" is the latter.It's unlike anything you have ever read. Trust me.This book is brilliantly, beautifully written by Antonia Michaelis. I'm completely mesmerized by her words and her ability to interweave magic and realism in an intricate writing. Below is just one of my favorites:\n\"That cloak of love you were wearing\u2014he\u2019s torn it to shreds, undoing the seams of trust that held it together. How can you ever wear those shreds?\nIsn't it beautiful? Hello, the Beauty of Literature. I'm inlove.The story, however, is painful, enchantingly dark, and depressing. Sounds like your not kind of book? Not my kind either. It's like I have a love-hate relationship with this book. The turn of events are truly devastating, Anna is as stubborn as she is soft-hearted, and Abel is.. well, he's entirely different from the person I thought he was. But oh God, no one can ignore the brilliance of this book. The author is a genius for writing TWO STORIES at the same time, paralleling them perfectly. Here's an example:Abel telling a story to Micha (his sister) and Anna - \n\"Come on, you must be hungry,\" a rose girl said, and the rose people led the little queen farther inland, till they reached a small pavilion filled with rosebushes. \nThat was a few days after they met Anna. Clearly, she's the Rose Girl in Abel's fairytale. Everything and everyone in his story matches up the reality with a hint of mystery. And it doesn't stop there, it goes on and on and on as they meet new people and continue with their adventure. I'm completely in awe!It sort of reminds me of The Sea of Tranquility because it's written so well and the unfolding of events is slow yet so spellbinding. The only difference is, this book is so much darker and the romance is different in so many ways. It will certainly open your eyes to \ntruths that are no fairytale.\nOverall, this is magical realism at its finest. Truly OUTSTANDING!!!"}, {"userName": "juan carlos", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22131351-juan-carlos", "userReview": "UN LIBRO POTENTE, FUERTE, CRUEL, DESPIADADO, NO VOY A OLVIDAR ESTE LIBRO EN TODA MI VIDA.

A bad boy. A fairy tale that's true. A truth that is no fairy tale.\nOnce in a while you come across a book that has a story to tell you, a story so alive that you feel you are living it with your every heart beat. A story where nothing else matter except the story itself. A story that stays with you every waking moment and makes you wish that it was just a story, You are not living it you are reading it, that makes a whole lot of difference. Why can't you come out the trance it created? Why can't it just tell you a story and leave it at that? Why follow you around refusing to release you from its grip? Will you ever come out from the world it has created? THE STORYTELLERThe Storyteller is not an answering man. You can ask questions but don't expect answers because he weaves words to make a story but not answers. That's what Abel is, he is a storyteller who weaves magical tales for his little sister Micha. Not a polish drug dealer, not a thug but deep down a story teller. But no one knows this part of his tale, they see him for what he shows, an outcast in a military parka with a cigarette in his hands and an earphone in his ears that plays white noises to keep the world out. THE ROSE GIRLLiving inside her very own bubble. In the house with blue lights and robin's, the rose girl Anna's life changes the moment she sets her eyes on a tiny worn out doll in the student's lounge. Who could it belong to? This tiny doll which she had the insane urge to protect. Could it belong to the polish drug dealer with icy blue eyes? The intimidating outcast who has a little sister to look after. Does she want to venture in to this world outside her bubble? A dark unknown world where Abel weaves his story. To the world of a story teller and his little orphaned queen. Was she suppose to be a part of their story?  THE LITTLE ORPHAN QUEEN The little queen has lived on her tiny island of rocks and cliffs all her life. With her beautiful white mare, her a one room castle, her canopy bed and her pink jacket with artificial fur. She was happy and content. She had a diamond heart which shone as bright as the sun. In the stories that Abel created his little sister Micha was the queen, the queen with the diamond heart that others wanted. But the island was sinking and the queen had to reach the mainland before the man with the blond mustache claims her. The man who bears her name and will ask her to call him \"father\" when he meets her. He is not alone in his pursuits. There is the diamond trader who wants to take her away and trade her diamond heart. There is the diamond cutter who wants to cut out and shape her diamond heart to her liking. Can she out run them and reach the main land with the help of her sea lion protector, her rose girl and rest of her motley crew?. She has only has to hold on till her brother's 18th birthday to reach mainland. BLOSSOMING LOVE Why can't Anna leave the polish drug dealer alone? Why is she so determined to be a part of his story? Why is she following him around and listening to the stories he create? Is she willing to leave the island of roses to be a part of the little queen's crew? Because it is a journey that could never bring her back. The sea lion never liked the island of roses. There was too many thorns and it was way different from their island. But the rose girl has found a place in their journey. She protected the little queen and in the process gave her heart to the story teller. Everything was the same in the island of roses. She was waiting for the little queen. But the story teller was wary, the rose girl did not belong here. She has a different path ahead of her. One with less perils and a happy ending. Why does she want to be a part of something so disastrous that even the story teller cannot predict the outcome.  THE ISLAND OF MURDERERS The island of murderers is empty. Which means the murderer was with them all along. The one who was killing off the villains in the story and in real life, starting with the man with the blond mustache, Micha's father and then the diamond trader, the social services agent. Is the murderer really among them ? Is it the sea lion which can turn in to a giant wolf when the occasion calls for it? How far will the he go to protect his queen? Did the rose girl really fall in love with a murderer? The story teller who can weave magic with words, the one who has hurt her and gave her a scar which would never fade. Is he capable of murder? If so will their journey have a happy ending or will the selfless rose girl fade away like all the other characters in his story?A single red rose in a sea of eternal winter. Will summer come for them? These broken characters trying to reach the mainland. Only time will tell. A story can be told in so many different ways but only a true storyteller can tell you a story in a way that touches your heart and leave a lasting impression. Antonia Michaelis is one such story teller and this story a single red rose. Tears are rolling down my cheeks while I say goodbye to them. Those wonderful characters that has enchanted me. Maybe I don't have to say goodbye after all, I could make up my very own story for them. If there is one thing that this book teaches you, then it is the power of a good story to captivate you. I was in double mind about reading this book. After reading the synopsis it is very difficult to comprehend that there is going to be a happy ending coming your way and I am not a fan of sad endings. But curiously most sad ending books end up as my favorite. Antonia Michaelis \"The Story Teller\" is a different kind of an experience. Is there a novelty in the story?. At first glance the answer is no. There are a lot of stories out there with a tortured hero with responsibilities and a kindhearted girl who wants to show him some happiness in life. In the end either everything turns out happy or sad. But does it really make a difference? My answer would be no it is not the ending that makes the difference but the path that gets you there. If the path is contrived, boring and unrelated you would be happy that the characters had removed themselves from the face earth. The best decision they made in this whole story, by relieving the earth of their burden. But if the path is imaginative and wonderful, with moments that nurture your creativity and enlighten your mind then you end up with a different sort of nameless, confused emotion that leaves you fulfilled and incomplete at the same time. That leaves a whole in your heart that your never want to fill up and this quality is the novelty in this story. The in depth emotions, the strained relationships, the threatening secrets and a fairy tale that binds them all together. A fairy tale whose landscapes arise out of their doubts, the islands symbolic of their points in life and a path as treacherous as the frozen ocean in winter that can give away any time.A story within a story but which do you prefer? Antonia's or Abel's. At times I thought Abel's was a distraction from the true story line but as the story progressed I began to realize that the story is not just a story but an insight in to the mind of a simple story teller. A mind so full of emotions that a simple rambling in between lines is not enough to bring out his true self but a beautiful story told in the simplest of words. A story where every one was trying to save the little queen. But was it the queen that needed the saving. Is she the victim here or is the subtlest of hints pointing to a different character altogether. The rose girl Anna, the one who wants to come out of her bubble only to realize that she was the only one without it in the first place. Everyone around her has created a small bubble around themselves which she mistook for her own. She saw what others couldn't see but was her sight a gift or a burden. After finishing this story I am still trying to find the answers to these questions but in this story there are no straight answers only more question because in this world there are more questions than answers. Sometimes even the right question has no answers. A truly imaginative and wonderful book that will leave you shattered in such a way that even if you pick up the pieces and arrange them in order you could never be the same.

He knew that though. He didn't want to be excused or forgiven. What it does do is make it easy to sympathize. At least it did for me. I, like Anna, was able to still love him even if I couldn't forgive him. And that's about the rape and the murders. I mean, how many times does a man have to say 'stop, no'? In my opinion, Anna was also wrong, albeit on a smaller scale. I was uncomfortable with the scene long before he lost control because Abel kept saying he didn't want it. Just because a man has an erection does not mean he WANTS sex! It's a body's reaction to stimulation and they can't prevent it.

Her gaze gets drawn to the mysterious Abel, one of her bad boy classmates rumored to be a drug dealer.Hit with a strong stalkerish urge, she starts following him around. Anna soon finds out that Abel has a 6 year-old sister, to whom he's been telling a strange but eerily familiar fairy tale. As the story progresses, our characters grow closer, tragedy strikes, and the fairy tale that mirrors their lives much too closely starts to foreshadow a grim future.I had initially chosen The Storyteller, based on its readability factor. Unlike the other German books I've tried reading, I actually understood most of the first page. Part of the YA genre, and chock full of raving ratings, I was fully prepared to be fairly underwhelmed, and yet... It was Anna's \"inner Gitta\" that drew me in right from the start. I greatly enjoyed the motherly tone that the heroine would channel through Gitta, and then go ahead and ignore its sensible advice. I don't think I cared much about the \"real\" Gitta, but I really liked Anna's inner voice. After that, it was the fairy tale within the story that kept me reading. I definitely felt the same excitement that Micha did, whenever Abel would finally pick its narrative up.While, on the whole, I did get the symbolism of it all, I much preferred to 'listen' to the fairy tale as a stand-alone fantastic universe. Dreadfully superficial of me perhaps, but I ended up enjoying the story a lot more this way.I found the ending appropriately tragic, though not irrevocably so... which is an interesting point in its favor.
