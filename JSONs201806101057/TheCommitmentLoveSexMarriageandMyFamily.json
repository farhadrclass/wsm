I am fortunately able to do this, because I am a heterosexual. If I was not, my attempt to enter into a legally-binding, stable relationship with my significant other would apparently rock the very foundations of the institution, and possibly turn a bunch of small, innocent children into drag queens, like some kind of ray gun.Dan Savage, famous syndicated sexual advice columnist (and now \u00fcber-famous homosexual) either is or is not married to his long-time partner Terry. It depends on who you ask. If you ask Dan and Terry, they are married, because they looked into each other's eyes and made a commitment, for better or for worse. If you ask most state governments, they are not, because gay marriage doesn't exist. The federal government agrees.It's all right there in the title: The Commitment is about Dan's struggle with what marriage means to him. Why should he want to be married when marriage won't have him? Marriage is an institution, a part of culture, and it is between a man and a woman. Kings and queens. Mommy and daddy. Princes and princesses. Simba and Nala. Even Dan and Terry's son agrees: he likes having two dads, but they shouldn't be married, because they are two men. Two men getting married is gay!Gays also shouldn't be married because marriage is a covenant before the Lord. Never mind if you are a Hindu or an atheist. I mean, apparently. Otherwise, why would so many Mormons and Southern Baptists care if two ladies from Jersey want to tie the knot? Surely they are mocking God, and that is just going to bring the hellfire and brimstone down upon us all.So, marriage. Marriage is sacred.Except marriage isn't sacred, or isn't just sacred. Marriage is, governmentally speaking, a legal arrangement. It is an agreement granting two people certain rights and protections: inheritance, medical visitation, power of attorney. Tax benefits. People don't just get married because God says they are supposed to if they want to do it; they also want to have legal standing, vis-\u00e0-vis their relationship with their spouse. Lots of people cohabitate these days instead of marrying, thinking they don't need \" a piece of paper\" from the state to legitimize their relationship. Which, ok, they don't. Until one of them is hospitalized, or dies, or writes a multi-million selling international blockbuster mystery series and then dies. Then, they are probably screwed.Just like all the gay couples are screwed, all the time.My deal is, if you think marriage is sacred, fine. If your religious beliefs tell you a marriage is between a man and a woman, fine. But marriage in the church and marriage as a legal relationship are different things. That's why you still need a document from the court to legitimize it. And I would ask you, whoever you are, to please keep your religious beliefs off to the side when it comes to dictating who can and can't visit a loved one in the hospital. I don't understand how gays marrying hurts regular marriage, which is cruising toward obsolescence just fine all on its own, with fewer people marrying later in life and extramarital affairs as popular as ever (a small joke: gay marriage exists; lots of gay men are married... to women). Of course, I also don't understand how saying the word \"gay\" in the classroom damages society either.This book is Dan Savage's struggle with wanting and not wanting to be married. Approaching a milestone anniversary, he and Terry are alternately planning a party and a wedding. They aren't quite sure which it is going to be until the last minute. The thing is, it's all theoretical anyway, because whatever they -- two consenting adults in a committed relationship -- ultimately decide, it doesn't matter. Because it won't be legal.I think that totally sucks.Facebook 30 Day Book Challenge Day 9: Book that makes you sick."}, {"userName": "Kasia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8024272-kasia", "userReview": "Two gays in committed relationships don't want to get married because they don't want to act \"straight\".

Part memoir, part politics, Dan Savage is his usual fun and hilarious self in this book. He also makes some great, occasionally cutting points, especially in his \"Borrowed\" and \"Blue\" chapters. Shit! I stole 'The Gay Lifestyle' for my straight self!Think about the way many straight people live today. After college, straight men and women move to the big city. Their first orders of business are landing good jobs and finding cool apartments. Then the hunt for sex begins. Most young straights aren't interested in anything serious, so they avoid dating and look for 'friends with benefits,' or they just 'hook up' [...] When they're not having sex, they're going to gyms, drinking, and dancing. And since they don't have kids, these young, hip, urban straight people have lots of disposable income to spend on art, travel, clothes, restaurants, booze and other recreational drugs.And do you know what all of that hooking up, drinking and partying used to be called? 'The Gay Lifestyle.' [...] Straight people all over the United States are living the Gay Lifestyle, circa 1978. The only difference is that social conservatives don't condemn straights for being hedonists or attempt to legislate against the straight version of the Gay Lifestyle.(Oh, and PS: gays, you can't raise chitlins or commit to one another or share health benefits or get power of attorney or whatever, unless you're in a few select states. But the rest of us will totally dance in your clubs.)These arguments were well-written and developed, but I do have one beef: for a book that spends the majority of its text talking about how ridiculous and jinxy marriage is for *anyone*, I felt a little jolted when its author suddenly decides to get married in the end. (And with no legal benefits unless laws change in Washington, since the marriage occurred in Canada.) Dan Savage! Please tell me why you got married! I want to believe in marriage, I really do! Your book was bumming me out a little bit. You spent so much time convincing me that monogamy was unnatural and unrealistic, that vows were a surefire way to damn an otherwise content relationship, that our definitions of \"successful marriage\" were screwy and based not upon happiness but someone's death. Dear Lord you're right! But wait! Now I'm standing in the middle of a freeway, and cars are whizzing by on both sides and I'm all \"whoa what the hell, where do I go from here my paradigms have been (not really overthrown so much as) stabbed with forks and chucked in the river, and I'm somewhat perplexed and soggy and what about fairy tales and stuff I kind of like those\" and you're all \"WE DIDN'T GET MARRIED THE END\" and I'm all \"well of course you didn't, that kind of commitment is for fools\" and then ten pages later (spoiler alert) you're all \"HAHAHA J/K, WE DID.\"That was an amusing trick and all, but seriously. Why did you get married, Dan Savage? That deserves more than a chapter in a book called The Commitment."}, {"userName": "Johnny", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1336672-johnny", "userReview": "Oh man this one was good too! In this book, Dan Savage devotes a lot more time to research on his subject than he did in The Kid, which was more more a personal narrative than this one. This one is still a memoir, telling the tale of the gay marriage issue in his relationship, but I loved how he actually brings in lots of quotes and references to other sources. Most of it is still ridiculously funny, but I found myself crying a lot reading this book! It's a great read!"}, {"userName": "Tamara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41724-tamara", "userReview": "Let's talk about tone for a minute: All stories written with an agenda, whether you agree with the agenda or not, tend to sound forced and opinionated and in-your-face. That would probably be my main criticism of this book. When you've had to spend your whole life defending your choices to others, you come off sounding, um...defensive. And maybe a bit rude. I don't think that wins you any friends in the other camp, or helps you to change people's minds about a emotionally-charged topic. Now, let's talk about content: This book did what all good books do. It made me think. Anyone who knows me well knows that I have some pretty strong views of marriage (in the way it relates to me and my hopes and dreams.) I also believe that everyone else has strong views of marriage, and that everyone else must decide what is right for them, what works for them and how it relates to their hopes and dreams. In essence, this is the journey you take when reading this book. Terry and Dan are trying to decide what marriage is to them, how it will define them and what they want to get out of it, if anything. Everyone who considers marriage must do the same. What makes me sad is that their journey is mired by and complicated by politics and religion and everyone else's opinions about what they should do, what they can do, and what it means to all other marriages in the world. The Big PictureThe three things that struck me most: 1. All successful marriages end in death. If one or the other of you didn't die, you have failed at marriage. This seems like the silliest thing in the world. 2. Most marriages are defined by monogamy. I, too, fall prey to this assumption. The author made me seriously rethink this definition, even though if I ever chose to marry, this would be one way that I would define my marriage. 3. Canada sounds awesome. P.S. The small picture: This edition had typos galore. I mean, really, it was just sad. Favorite QuotesFor children, promises are a deadly serious business because it's all they really have. They don't own anything, they don't control anything. The promises their parents make them are all they've got. And while no parent can keep every promise he makes - no child can either - your credibility as a parent rests on a promises-kept-to-promises-broken ranking that your child carries around in his head. Keep more than you break, and you're a parent in good standing. Break more than you keep and you're in trouble. She somehow manages to stay sunny and upbeat while expecting the worst and praying for the best. By 'myth' I don't mean 'lie,' I mean a story a culture uses to explain itself to itself. The Straight Lifestyle was only \"straight\" because gay people weren't allowed to form lasting relationships, or to have families, things we weren't allowed to do because for centuries straight people insisted we were incapable of it."}, {"userName": "Christiana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/434450-christiana", "userReview": "Dan Savage reminds me of that guy at a party. You know, the guy who starts talking and seems pretty interesting. You heard about him from your friends and his life is atypical. You wouldn't mind hearing a little about it. But then he opens his mouth and you realize how self-congratulatory he is and that (Dan hopes) you're just there to marvel at him. Suddenly, you can't get away. You search over his shoulder while he drones on, looking for an escape method, but no one comes. He doesn't even notice your lack of interest and negative body language, he just plows on. He manages to alienate you (even though you agree with a lot of his core beliefs!) by picking on EVERYONE, even people who agree with him. And he manages to say it three different ways. Because of this, I am unsure who Savage wrote this book for. There's a point where Dan Savage mocks Catholics, saying that they go to church service and then go right on using contraceptives. He then goes on to say (in a different part of the book) Catholics are a big part of the problems affecting homosexuals because everyone follows the rules to the t. No, Dan, you can't have it both ways. And in the process, no one wants to understand your thought process anymore after you refuse to understand other people's points of views and systems.Listen, I think Dan Savage is great, even if it doesn't sound like it. I love the It Gets Better Project and that it exists. I think his life sounds pretty great. I'm glad he's around. I just don't ever want to read his books (especially not on audio, it was like the man kept yelling at me in the car) ever again."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41583-rebecca", "userReview": "I remember really liking this when the rest of book club was a little uneven about it, and I somehow never put my favorite quotes in Goodreads (what?!) and just came across my list of them, so here they are!

Which is part of what makes us so good together: We know when and how to leave each other alone.\"\"When your life is going along nicely, when things are looking good, the correct posture to assume is one of gratitude, absent of any hint that you expect your good fortune to last. It's kind of a defensive crouch.\"\"I call it Permanent Romance, like Trotsky's idea of Permanent Revolution.

Coming home to an empty house, not having anyone to confide in, facing illnesses on your own -- being alone hurts, but people can get used to it. But being in a long-term relationship doesn't spare you from all that day-to-day pain. It just banks it. Every day I'm with Terry, every day I'm not alone, a little misery gets put into a savings account, where interest is compounded hourly. The day Terry dies, all the pain I avoided when I was with him will be paid out all at once; I will suffer a windfall of misery. I imagine the pain would feel literally like being torn in two. Maybe that's what people mean when they talk about 'one flesh'?\"\"A religious straight couple can have a big church wedding and kids and the wife can submit to the husband and they can stay married until death parts them -- provided that's what they both want when they marry, and that's what both of them continue to want throughout the marriage. Or a couple of straight secular humanists can get married in a tank full of dolphins and never have kids and treat each other as equals and split up if they decide their marriage isn't working out -- again, if that's what they both want. ...The problem for opponents of gay marriage isn't that gay people are trying to redefine marriage in some new, scary way, but that straight people have redefined marriage to a point that it no longer makes any logical sense to exclude same-sex couples.\"\"One of the most underrated virtues -- one I'd like to see virtuecrats promote to parents everywhere, and a virtue many homos have a problem with -- is constancy. Once you're a parent, you simply have to stop reinventing yourself while your children are young.\" \"When the demands and pressures of monogamy threaten the survival of a relationship, it's better to toss the baggage of monogamy overboard than to sacrifice the ship of the relationship itself. But I'm a conservative; what do I know?\"\"When people have to pretend that they find no one else attractive, they have to suppress a large part of their sex drive, and that means suppressing (unconsciously, sure, but definitely) their sexual feelings about their partner.\" \"...our modern concept of love has at its foundation not only the expectation of monogamy, but the idea that where there's love, monogamy should be easy and joyful.

But then, it didn't have to\u2014I was already in favor. I don't see where the state has any right to deny its formal recognition to the relationships of people like Dan Savage and Terry, his partner of ten years (at the time). Nor\u2014speaking as a married guy in a relationship that's just about as heteronormative in structure as it could be\u2014do I see how gay marriage could possibly be a threat to, or even affect, my own commitment. So Savage was preaching to the converted here.But that in itself wasn't why I enjoyed reading this book so much, anyway. What makes this book so enjoyable is very simple\u2014it's a good story: candid, heartwarming and vividly told. Savage's prose is fluid and competent, but straightforward\u2014he is a journalist and advice-column writer, after all, and there are few if any literary flourishes here\u2014but there are times when candor trumps style, I think, and this is one of 'em.Dan and Terry are closing in on their tenth anniversary of being together as a couple, already married in all but name. They have adopted a son whom they named D.J., and whom they've raised since just after his birth. As The Commitment opens, their family is facing increasing pressure from some very powerful forces (namely, Dan's mother Judy) to do something significant to mark that anniversary. So they start discussing making that tenth-anniversary party a wedding celebration\u2014or as close to one as they're allowed to come, anyway, in mid-2000s Seattle. Getting married would have no legal force, after all; these are some dark days anyway, just after Bush's (still-baffling) re-election, and it's not at all clear whether gays are going to retain the rights they'd gained, much less continue to increase acceptance. Dan and Terry's symbolic gesture seems appropriate, but also seems likely to remain entirely symbolic\u2014so their first discussions are about whether they should even bother. Why jinx a perfectly functional relationship over a futile gesture? Why not just get complementary tattoos, instead?I can empathize with that. My wife and I dealt with some of the same issues when we were deciding whether and when to get married, and we had the luxury of being in a more traditionally-sanctioned relationship (though we were still \"living in sin,\" as the phrase goes). That's part of what makes Savage's memoir so readable, of course\u2014he speaks of what I hesitate to call universals, given the wide variety of human experience, but certainly about commonalities. If you're paying any attention, you'll see yourself in some of these pages, whatever your orientation.Do they or don't they? I won't spoil the ending here... but in any case The Commitment, like all commitments, has its ups and downs, its dark moments and its joys... which are, of course, what make them worthwhile."}, {"userName": "Manik Sukoco", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44105134-manik-sukoco", "userReview": "Dan Savage is by far at his best and funniest when he sticks to memoir, reporting on the squabbles and crises of his daily life. That's why this book is much better than the last one, \"Skipping Towards Gomorrah,\" which tended to veer into ranting and contrivances, but not quite as good as \"The Kid,\" which had a little more meat to its story.Here, the back-stories of his relatives and their marriages or lack of them are moderately interesting. There are a few anti-religious-right rants that go on too long, but only a few. It's the conversations between Dan and his boyfriend and their son, in all their crankiness and irrationality, that make this book stand out. It really comes into its own in the last couple of chapters, which had me laughing out loud.It's great to read a book by someone who cares deeply about gay rights, yet can make fun of the part of himself that wants to get married in order to make people take his \"Big Gay Love\" seriously.

In this forms of media, he crafts a persona that is perpetually empathetic but perpetually pragmatic and emotionally reserved. However, within the pages of The Commitment lie a much more personal account of Savage's own experience and relationship with his (now) husband, Terry, providing a rich framework and intimate narrative behind the advice and arguments he makes in other spheres. It was especially meaningful to read The Commitment, which is a book about a gay man's thoughts on marriage that was written in a time in which gay marriage was explicitly illegal in much of the country, many years after its publication. Savage writes with a younger voice in this book, which means his wording can be less nuanced than his current parlance. However, I enjoyed this voice immensely, especially because it gave such weight to the topics he tackles. As a female who is in a heterosexual relationship, I am reviewing this book as an outsider, someone who read this book without it necessarily eliciting memories of my own romantic experience.

Dan Savage makes little effort to disguise his intense dislike for fat people, straight people, women, and even dogs throughout and listening to such a bitter narration does little to gain the support or interest of this reader. It got a little better towards the end, but not enough to really make it enjoyable overall. At least Dan seems to know how narrow-minded he is. He is clearly not a graduate of the \"flies with honey program.\"For the record, I support gay marriage legislation as does probably everyone that willingly reads this book. I used to love Dan Savage's Savage Love column back when I lived in a city with a weekly that ran it. I respect the \"it gets better\" movement. I was so curious as to what Terry looked like because of Dan's descriptions, I had to google him afterwards."}, {"userName": "Meg - A Bookish Affair", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132408-meg---a-bookish-affair", "userReview": "I read this book after reading a review on one of my favorite blogs, A Practical Wedding (yes, I still read it even though I'm now married; it's a great, down to earth source about what it means to be married without giving into WIC- wedding industrial complex).Dan Savage, writer and sex advice columnist, has been with his boyfriend for ten years and they have a son together. Dan and his boyfriend can't legally get married because they are two men. Dan explores what it means to be married. Do you really need an over the top proclamation of your love? Is it necessary to fulfill that Disney princess fantasy? What happens if you can't even be legally married? What does it mean to make a commitment?I wish I would have read this book before my own wedding as it would have helped to quell some of those nerves I was feeling at the time but as a newlywed, I appreciated this book all the same. There is a lot of truth to this book. I think it would be good for anyone thinking about marriage, about to get married, married, or even just thinking that someday they might want to get into a serious relationship."}, {"userName": "Melody", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5119192-melody", "userReview": "This book was shocking and touching and thought provoking and one of the best books I have ever read. I was not familiar with Dan Savage prior to hearing an interview about this book on NPR. Of course, he did not use the same graphic language or extremely open depictions and discussions of sex in his interview that he did in his book or that he uses in his sex advice column. While I got an education (much needed) about what might be going on in my sons sex lives, I also got an education about marriage and what makes one successful even when it doesn't outlast the participants. Savage's style is engaging and challenging and I couldn't put this down. I want to read it again as soon as I can remember who the heck I leant it to. Oh, and I forgot to mention you will laugh, you will cry, you will wince. Classic Savage."}, {"userName": "Nicholas", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/646385-nicholas", "userReview": "I really liked Savage's book, The Kid (about his and his boyfriend's adoption of their son), but this one, not so much. Part of it is that he presents such logical explanations (good ones, but I've made up my mind, I'll admit) throughout the book for choosing one option in the to-marry-or-not-to-marry debate and then goes and does exactly the opposite. He also tells us over and over again how hot his boyfriend is (once or twice would have been sufficient). He continually emphasizes that he brings home the bacon in the family (there is more than a little of what we would call sexism were his boyfriend a woman; at the very least he glorifies his own role). And honestly, despite the fact that I think Savage is really astute in his skewering of the religious right, the book just wasn't that funny."}, {"userName": "Xanthi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5966790-xanthi", "userReview": "This is my first book by Dan Savage and I definitely want to read more by him because this book delivered on so many levels. It was funny (I was in a fit of giggles many, many times), educational (I realized how little I knew about the legal issues surrounding gay marriage and adoption in the USA), and thought provoking. This last element was the clincher for me. I found myself thinking about marriage, not only in the context of same sex couples, but in general. (The term 'grand romantic gesture' will stay with me.) And although I am a straight woman who is not opposed to same sex marriage, I found myself realizing that even some of my attitudes and beliefs towards gay people and their relationships, somewhat askew. The author presented his arguments intelligently and clearly. He made me see things in a different way. He made me THINK...and I LOVE that!"}, {"userName": "Nicola", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121445-nicola", "userReview": "This is part memoir -- the long road that Dan and his boyfriend, Terry take to saying \"I do\" -- and part discussion of modern relationships and what marriage means (its original meanings; its evolution; why defenders of \"traditional values\" are talking out of their asses). Some people write Dan Savage off as an insufferable asshole (which he is, sometimes), but he's also a well-informed and thought-provoking narrator on life issues. This book made me think hard about marriage. It's also a great memoir. There are some moments that Dan captures of his family that I can only describe as beautiful.I liked The Kid a liiittle bit more, but that's no reflection on this book, which more than adequately stands as something that's both enjoyable and Worth Reading."}, {"userName": "Maughn Gregory", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2713460-maughn-gregory", "userReview": "First, I'm so proud of my small-town, southern Utah county library for offering this audiobook! I've always liked Dan Savage when he gets angry on TV over the latest right-wing atrocity and I enjoy his podcast sometimes but, not having actually read him, I had no idea he was such a brilliant memoirist and essayist. As a fairly politically-involved man in an almost 20-year gay partnership, who also raised a child, I thought I had thought through and lived out all the political, social, economic and emotional ins and outs of that whole thing; so I was delighted to learn more from Savage's thinking and experiences. His blend of memoir and political diatribe is thought-provoking, heart-warming and hilarious."}, {"userName": "Sophie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1408800-sophie", "userReview": "I loved this book. I don't always agree with Dan Savage, but I really enjoyed reading about his path to marriage. He is hilarious and honest, and I think I fell in love with the beautiful Terry a little bit too. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about what it means to be married and the nature of love and commitment.I definitely agree with other reviewers that Savage can be a bit acerbic about certain issues (that is probably a huge understatement) but since I am a grouchy New Englander I can relate to his misanthropy perhaps better than most. It didn't bother me even though I did roll my eyes a few times at his \"all women want a huge giant fairytale wedding\" comment.

Here's what I learned: that lingering sense that, while Dan Savage is kind of generally assumed to be on my team because our Kinsey scores are similar, he's actually kind of a douche and would sell me out in a heartbeat? it's pretty accurate. he may be gay, openly sexual, and monogamish, but this man is pretty socially conservative. he and I do not share politics. I stopped feeling betrayed by him as I read this book, and instead felt an understanding that Dan Savage is basically a conservative White Guy who happens to be gay. his allegiances were never the same as mine. and that piece of understanding made reading the whole thing worthwhile."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7632-alicia", "userReview": "Although I've listened to the Savage Lovecast for many years, this is the first of Dan's books I've read. Overall, I found it a fun and enjoyable read. His anecdotes are amusing, and I always love to hear him call out and castigate anti-gay crazies. My only real quibble with the book is that although Dan rails against oppression, there are some cringe-worthy moments of blindness to his privilege, including some painful/offensive jokes directed at other identity groups. My sense from listening to the Lovecast is that Dan's views have progressed since this book was published (2005), so perhaps it's just dated."}], "description": "The true story of a marriage (not really), a lovable and relentless mother, a six-year old who says his parents cannot get married (but wants to go to the reception), a partner who doesn?t want to act like a straight person, and the author, who has written a hilarious and poignant memoir about making ?The Commitment.?
