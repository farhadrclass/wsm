Well, if a boy, about to turn 11, takes the time to recommend a book to me, odds are I'm going to read it.The voice of the 10-year-old, Bud (not Buddy), in this novel is irrepressible and the setting of Flint, Michigan, during the Depression comes to life with tons of details but not a one of them ponderous. While keeping its tone age-appropriate, there's no talking down to the reader or even the tying-up in a pretty bow of all the loose ends. There's sadness (reality), of course, (one scene brought tears to my eyes, but that's from an adult's perspective) but most of it is just fun, and even funny. (There's one gross (to me) description of soda-backwash that I almost couldn't read, the kind of thing many boys seem to love.) And though there's lots of heart to the story, there's no moralizing. As Bud says: I'd learned that it was best to be asleep before Momma finished the story because if she got done and I was still awake, she'd always tell me what the story was about. I never told Momma, but that always ruint the fun of the story. Shucks, here I was thinking I was just hearing something funny about a fox or a dog and Momma spoilt it by telling me they were really lessons about not being greedy or wishing for things you couldn't have.It was interesting to this adult to learn in the Afterword that two of the older characters were based on the author's grandfathers, one of whom pitched in the minors of the Negro Baseball Leagues, one of my interests."}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "Audio book performed by James Avery. 5***** and a \u2764In Depression-era Flint, Michigan, 10-year-old Bud Caldwell (BUD, not Buddy) is plucked from the \u201chome\u201d to go to a foster family. This will be the third foster home he\u2019s been in, and he\u2019s not impressed. But he takes his worn, cardboard suitcase with his few but treasured possessions and tries to make the best of it. Before he knows it, he\u2019s on the lam, determined to find his own way and sure that the things his Momma left him are clues to his father\u2019s identity and whereabouts. I love Bud. He\u2019s imaginative, intelligent, resourceful, well-mannered, curious, and ever-hopeful. Once he\u2019s decided to find the man he is sure is his father, nothing will stop him. He endures hunger and fear, but also comes across kind-hearted men and women who help him (though he isn\u2019t always forthcoming about his goal, and outright lies about his situation more than once).

In writing this 2000 Newbery Medal and Coretta Scott King award-winning book, he wove another magical, enchanting, complex, well crafted and spell binding tale filled with poignancy, sadness and laughter while teaching history in a captivating way.I've raved about this author before, so please indulge my obsession one more time in encouraging you to take a few hours of solitude to savor every word, phrase and nuance of this incredible writer.What's in a name? The answer is a tremendous asset and sole identity to Bud, NOT Buddy! As a ten year old orphan in 1936 hard-hit depression filled Flint, Michigan, Bud has little else. Four years ago his beloved mother died, leaving him is name and a few possessions he guards with his life.The sum total of his existence is held in a raggle taggle suitcase he lugs from one orphanage or foster home to another. The string-bound cardboard container holds some rocks with dates painted upon them, a photo of his mama as a child riding a pony, and a few fliers listing a jazz group led by Herman E. Calloway.When the last foster home experience culminated in a beating and fearful night of imprisonment in a back yard shack, Buddy knows he has had enough! Believing that his mother kept the fliers for a reason and that his unknown father must be Herman E. Calloway, Buddy runs away from Flint to Grand Rapids, seeking love and a home to call his own.Christopher Paul Curtis masterfully writes about such complex issues as homelessness, poverty, racism, cruelty and poverty.Living in a cardboard Hooverville community for a few days, Bud meets likable, down and out characters. Finally reaching his destination and claiming his identity to the great jazz artist Mr. Calloway and The Dusky Devastators of the Depression, leads to unexpected discoveries for all with quite a surprising ending.I loved this book! I loved the spunky, determination of Bud, the complexity of the characters, the historical backdrop of the jazz age and the skillful depiction of a bleak period of time in American history.Five Stars!!!!"}, {"userName": "Stephanne Stacey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1956964-stephanne-stacey", "userReview": "My daughter had to read this for school. This is the daughter that doesn't like to read. She loved it, and told me that I had to read it as well! Any one that knows me would know how weird and remarkable that is. So I borrowed the class addition and read it this weekend. Amazing! For a young adult book this should be a must read. The story will make you laugh, cry, and hope that the protagonist will find what he is looking for. I even enjoyed the way it ended, resolved yet leaving you hoping that the future will be special for everyone. You will figure out who H.E.B. turns out to be long before everyone else in the book does. But that's okay because you end up hoping and rooting for the truth to be exposed.Chris's writing style is nicely periodesk and flows so well that you don't focus on how things are said, just that they were said. The vocabulary is appropriate for the story, protagonist, and young adult readers. A parent will not have to worry about the context or language of this book. It's easy to see why this is an award winning book. What is truly remarkable is that Chris's first book is also award winning and he only has the two books written as of yet.

It is about an Orphan thats an African Boy looking for this father with only few clues of finding him. He use to live with his mother all his life, but after his mother got sick for awhile, she dies and Bud is sent to \"The Home\". His mother did tell him his father was in a jazz band and Bud escaped and was on his way to look for his dad. I can make a text to world connection to Bud trying to find his dad because there are many people who don't grow up with their dad and hopes to find them one day. Their are people who are so serious about finding a family member they search for along time! Bud and some kids want a dad and want to have the opportunity to have one and see how its like. This is a very good book because it makes you not want to put it down. It is so interesting how a boy so young is so determined to find his father that he didn't grow up with. He is a very brave and courageous boy thats what makes this story so good. I would rate his book a 4 because it was very good for a history book.

Just a little too predictable. But it's powerfully told, and Curtis has the rare ability to get inside the head of his young narrators. Especially smart, sassy, sensitive little boys... Bud is definitely a winner. Audiobook minuses:While younger readers might find them really funny, these two things drove me CRazy. Especially trapped in the car wishing my eyes could glaze over a line or two.1)The slang seemed vaguely era-appropriate (see Rebecca's Fictional Pet Peeve #10) but was super overused, and not really cute the first time - \"woop, zoop, sloop.\" This was slightly redeemed by slipping \"dollars to donuts\" in there a few times.2) I started to cringe every time he launched into another of the \"Bud Caldwell Rules and Things for Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself.\" (Characters who make precocious lists? That's Rebecca's Fictional Pet Peeve #29)Audiobook plusses:1) It's read by James Avery, aka Uncle Phil from Fresh Prince! 2)Author's note read by author. Y'all know if there's anything I like better than historical fiction, it's the real history lesson at the end. Curtis talks about how he modeled the two important male influences in the book on his two grandfathers, who both managed to be successful black businessmen in Michigan during the depression.AND his little daughter sings her own composition featured in one of the scenes...

After a few days (and a failed attempt to hop a train), he realizes that the only place he knows to go is Grand Rapids, Michigan, to look up the man that he is convinced is his father. Unfortunately Herman E. Calloway, a famous jazz musician, has no interest in taking care of a 10-year-old orphan who could not possibly be his son. Bud lands on his feet, though, thanks to the interest of the other members of Calloway's band. Bud is an endearingly naive narrator who has collected all of the things he knows about life into \"Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things for Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself.\" Regardless of what kind of situation is in front of him, Bud looks for wisdom in his rules about how the world works. I listened to this as an audio book narrated by James Avery. The inclusion of jazz music throughout the story added an extra dimension to an already enjoyable book.

The adventurous nature of the book will appeal to children, as will the optimistic and humorous protagonist, Bud. Along his journey to find a family, Bud meets many interesting and well-presented characters, such as the mouth organ playing man at \"Hooverville,\" his friend, Bugs, and Miss Thomas. While the setting is bleak and sad, Bud remains funny and hopeful, popping up with bits of his \"Rules and Things To Have a Funner Life and Make a Better Liar Out of You.\"This book is richly layered with complex characters and numerous themes. A great book for children to begin to analyze literature with, as it is rich enough to contain many subject topics to discuss. However, it is not lacking in the 'fun' factor either. There are also lots of historical elements to open up discussions. This is a magical mix of education and entertainment. An all around winner. A well deserved award winner.Publishers WeeklyAs in his Newbery Honor-winning debut, The Watsons Go to Birmingham--1963, Curtis draws on a remarkable and disarming mix of comedy and pathos, this time to describe the travails and adventures of a 10-year-old African-American orphan in Depression-era Michigan. Bud is fed up with the cruel treatment he has received at various foster homes, and after being locked up for the night in a shed with a swarm of angry hornets, he decides to run away. His goal: to reach the man he--on the flimsiest of evidence--believes to be his father, jazz musician Herman E. Calloway. Relying on his own ingenuity and good luck, Bud makes it to Grand Rapids, where his \"father\" owns a club. Calloway, who is much older and grouchier than Bud imagined, is none too thrilled to meet a boy claiming to be his long-lost son. It is the other members of his band--Steady Eddie, Mr. Jimmy, Doug the Thug, Doo-Doo Bug Cross, Dirty Deed Breed and motherly Miss Thomas--who make Bud feel like he has finally arrived home. While the grim conditions of the times and the harshness of Bud's circumstances are authentically depicted, Curtis shines on them an aura of hope and optimism. And even when he sets up a daunting scenario, he makes readers laugh--for example, mopping floors for the rejecting Calloway, Bud pretends the mop is \"that underwater boat in the book Momma read to me, Twenty Thousand Leaks Under the Sea.\" Bud's journey, punctuated by Dickensian twists in plot and enlivened by a host of memorable personalities, will keep readers engrossed from first page to last. Ages 9-12. (Sept.) Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.Children's LiteratureA great review that keys into the magic of the book. I agree and was \"engrossed from the first page to last.\" I read this aloud to my 10 and 11 year old, and they would beg me to keep reading. This is in indicator of a sure winner. It also had us talking about issues like the depression, being an orphan, being African American and other topics introduced in this book.It has really been hard for Bud since his Mama died--one foster home after another. When he runs away from a family that really mistreats him, all he knows is that his long lost father must be the famed jazz musician Herman E. Calloway. Otherwise, why would his Mama have kept the posters? Good luck and friendly folk help Bud reach Mr. Calloway, but his supposed daddy is none too welcoming. The band members and vocalist are just the opposite. Bud is a spunky and likable kid, and this book has a fairy tale ending--it all works out for Bud and readers are left with a truly warm and happy feeling. However, the hard times during the Depression and especially the difficulties faced by African Americans are not ignored. A fast read for individual readers and a great book to read aloud. I really like the tone of this review. It is light and incites the reader to read more.School Library JournalGr 4-7-When 10-year-old Bud Caldwell runs away from his new foster home, he realizes he has nowhere to go but to search for the father he has never known: a legendary jazz musician advertised on some old posters his deceased mother had kept. A friendly stranger picks him up on the road in the middle of the night and deposits him in Grand Rapids, MI, with Herman E. Calloway and his jazz band, but the man Bud was convinced was his father turns out to be old, cold, and cantankerous. Luckily, the band members are more welcoming; they take him in, put him to work, and begin to teach him to play an instrument. In a Victorian ending, Bud uses the rocks he has treasured from his childhood to prove his surprising relationship with Mr. Calloway. The lively humor contrasts with the grim details of the Depression-era setting and the particular difficulties faced by African Americans at that time. Bud is a plucky, engaging protagonist. Other characters are exaggerations: the good ones (the librarian and Pullman car porter who help him on his journey and the band members who embrace him) are totally open and supportive, while the villainous foster family finds particularly imaginative ways to torture their charge. However, readers will be so caught up in the adventure that they won't mind.

I think they'd like them--he really gets kids, and talks authentically from their viewpoint. Although his books deal with issues such as class, racism, and child abuse they never feel like \"issue\" books. They are funny, smart, and interesting.

Bud was talking about his mom while I was exiting the Massachusetts Turnpike, and I had to hold back tears because one really needs one's wits and clear vision during such a maneuver.

I really enjoyed this story. It is about a 10-year old orphan named Bud Caldwell. Bud\u2019s mother passed away when he was six and he has been in many foster homes the past four years and he finally decides to \u201cgo on the lam\u201d to try to find his long missing father. The journey and his discovery are both believable and entertaining. There are some touching and emotional parts in the story that were very well done. The author also included some clever humor which worked well to offset some of the heaviness of the plot. I laughed out loud many times while reading it. Christopher Paul Curtis has a winner with Bud, Not Buddy, and I recommend it for middle school readers."}, {"userName": "Toni FGMAMTC", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19424370-toni-fgmamtc", "userReview": "This story is way too adorable.

I really like Bud\u2019s determination to be reunited with his father. He still has the motivation to keep on going, to keep living, despite his age, the loss of his mother, and being sent to that terrible family. What was the boy\u2019s name? Tod, I think. I was rooting for Bud when he punched Tod in the face.(\u2022\u0300\u1d17\u2022\u0301)\u0648( \u2022 \u0300\u03c9\u2022\u0301 )\u2727 *Yeah Bud, you\u2019ve got this!*Bud even has a set of rules that he follows in order to direct his actions. (Although this is not fantasy or paranormal, the rules made be remember the book \u201cPaladin Prophecy\u201d.)It made me feel so warm inside and yet sad at the same time. Especially when Bud talked about his mother. In general, this was a great, heart warming book. I hope everyone can enjoy this as well.

The novel is written in first person through the perspective of a ten year old orphan boy named Bud during the 1930s, the time of the Great Depression. Bud suffers great tragedy creating an underdog character you will root for throughout the entire book. The situations in the book pull at the reader\u2019s heart strings, nostalgically, and may even jerk the reader into tears at times. Even so Bud, Not Buddy is a feel good, coming of age story tied into nonfictional aspects of American life during the Great Depression. The author references Hoovervilles which existed widely across the United States in this period of history. Although Bud, Not Buddy utilizes nonfictional settings the tone of the book rings true to the tone of what a ten year old boy sounds like. Bud endures struggles through the entire book challenging his self-efficacy and emotional endurance. Bud proves to be a strong, young man who in the end ultimately gets what he needs. These same struggles cause Bud to travel across the state of Michigan where he meets two women that change his life and a man who is less than desired. As all humans know to be true there are times where we get what we need not necessarily what we want. Bud experiences just this when his travels across the state bring him face to face with a pipe dream he spent the last four years of his life building up. Faced with anything and everything Bud ninety-nine percent of the time keeps a smile on his face. Throughout the book Bud references a list of rules he has made up to \u201chave a funner life and make a better liar out of yourself.\u201d These rules are not written down on paper but exist fluidly in Bud\u2019s mind. Along with the rules Bud carries a worn out cardboard suitcase where he keeps his prized possessions. This suitcase accompanies him through his travels. The suitcase is introduced to all of Bud\u2019s friends, enemies, and acquaintances. Other fictional characters have dogs that never leave their side, well this suitcase is Bud\u2019s dog. The suitcase and Bud end up where they need to be, the suitcase in the trash and Bud at home. Not the home as in the orphanage, a home as in a house filled with smells of home cooking and warmth of hugs and embarrassing but meaningful nicknames. With the struggles faced by Bud and other supporting characters in the book, Christopher Paul Curtis does an impeccable job at bringing some light and fun to a very serious subject. The humor and light heartedness the book has in some places puts the serious subjects such as homelessness, hunger, and abandoned children in a place where young readers feel comfortable discussing them. Bud, Not Buddy is a book which can be used to tie multiple subjects together such as history, vocabulary, and reading of language. Placing this book in your classroom library will benefit any student who picks up the novel for a read!"}], "description": "It's 1936, in Flint, Michigan. Ten-year-old Bud may be a motherless boy on the run, but he's on a mission. His momma never told him who his father was, but she left a clue: posters of Herman E.

Once he decides to hit the road and find this mystery man, nothing can stop him.BUD, NOT BUDDY is full of laugh-out-loud humor and wonderful characters, hitting the high notes of jazz and sounding the deeper tones of the Great Depression.", "title": "Bud, Not Buddy", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12437395-bud-not-buddy", "average": 3.9, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347345587l/12437395.jpg", "reviews": 4399, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6846.Christopher_Paul_Curtis", "name": "Christopher Paul Curtis"}], "type": ["Historical", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Childrens"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12437395-bud-not-buddy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368468.Bud_Not_Buddy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12895116-bud-not-buddy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241381.Bud_Not_Buddy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1436109.Bud_Not_Buddy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/887322.Bud_Not_Buddy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10415.Bud_Not_Buddy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108077.The_Watsons_Go_to_Birmingham_1963", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11288619-the-mighty-miss-malone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/638689.Elijah_of_Buxton", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161991.Bucking_the_Sarge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20894026-the-madman-of-piney-woods"]}
