The past few years, her books have been uneven for me, so I was a little nervous about picking this one up. The Smythe-Smiths were famous (or infamous is probably more accurate) but would it be what you expect from a Quinn book - a fun and light romance - or would it be like the past few duds? I was pleasantly surprised and somewhat relieved that I ended up enjoying it. I liked the simplicity of the book and the hero and heroine are very likable; one thing I love about Julia Quinn books is that her heroines are always women whom I think would be nice to have as friends. However the lack of any real spark made it not much of a keeper for me. When I really love a romance, I end the book with a ridiculously stupid grin on my face that doesn't go away for hours; here, that didn't happen. ProsIt did have some strong aspects, while also missing those that we - or at least I - often bemoan in romance book:-- There was no contrived subplot - mystery, mass-murdering or otherwise-- There is not instant lust; they've known each other since childhood and have considered one another practical brother and sister-- There are no love interests thrown in for the sole purpose of dragging the plot out and making you squirm in your seat - or couch or bed - and there were no hated Big Misunderstandings-- The book was really focused on the two main characters, Honoria and Marcus-- One really gets the sense that they would make a lovely couple and have a lot of what the other needsSo why the 3 stars? I was actually torn between 3 and 3.5, but either way I think this book may have suffered having been read a day after I finished two absolutely great HRs that I gave 4.5 and 5 stars. It was a perfect light, simple, fun romance read and sometimes that is what you need. Quinn delivers on the dialogue and back and forth repartee, just as she used to so wonderfully in the Bridgerton books.I also thought Marcus was a wonderful hero. Most romance heroes are rakes or rogues of some sort, but Marcus is actually a quiet, shy, serious (but not stuffy) sort of man. We're told that people often consider him formidable and imposing, but we're not ever really shown this, since we mostly see the softer side that he shows to Honoria. I loved that what he longed for was a family and someone to love who would love him in return. One of the things that draws him most to Honoria is her loving, carefree manner and the value she places on others, on family, and on tradition. In this sense, the story was truly lovely and Marcus's wonder in the Epilogue at the family he has begun to form is touching and sweet.ConsMy main criticisms that kept it from receiving a higher rating are the following:(1) Marcus gets deathly ill and Honoria rushes with her mother to his bedside to nurse him. This part seemed to really drag on and the section of his illness *seems* to take up half the book. Other romances have this plot device and don't suffer from it, but here I think it dragged on too long and since Marcus is insensible for most of it, one doesn't feel that it develops their relationship much.(2) While the part of his illness seemed dragged out, the rest seemed very, very rushed. What we enjoy is the process of them falling in love, them working their feelings out and acting them, and then the happy conclusion. This part of the story is not explored enough for me and besides for a brief little kiss when he gets better, the only other romance scene between them is at the end. Quinn's books have never been heavy on the steamy aspect, but I definitely expected more than this.The Smythe-Smith QuartetBook 1 - Just Like Heaven, Lady Honoria Smythe-SmithBook 2 - ?Book 3 - ?Book 4 - ?(My guess for the heroines are Iris, Sarah, and maybe ?Anne Wynter?)Bottom LineJust Like Heaven is perfect for a light, fun afternoon read and I would recommend getting it from the library, but don't read it when you're wanting a romance that packs a punch and affects you emotionally.\nThis review is of an advanced copy format of the book from the Amazon Vine Program."}, {"userName": "Blacky *Romance Addict*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8310179-blacky-romance-addict", "userReview": "This book made me  and , sometimes , sometimes , most of the time  and overall  The story - Honoria and Marcus have known each other since they were children.

I am part way through her Bridgertons series and got side tracked onto this one which is the first in her Smythe-Smith Quartet series. It is related and a couple of the Bridgerton brothers had parts to play.Quinn writes with a very light touch and her characters are always charming and entertaining. She is also very adept at humorous dialogue and it is easy to laugh out loud at certain moments.

I can\u2019t even begin to explain why if you put a woman in a corset and make her banter in an uptight and rigid social setting it becomes funnier than in a contemporary romance. Really I should hate books set in a time where a woman\u2019s main goal is to be attractive, virtuous and marry well, but I don\u2019t\u2026I love them. I usually read them in one sitting and love every indulgent filled moment of it.Just like heaven was my very first Julia Quinn novel. I\u2019ve been hearing from quite a few people that she is the go to for Historical Romance. I enjoyed every decadent moment I spent in this novel but it was really middle-of-the-road for me. It started out really enjoyable but I wanted the romance to move along just a little faster, this is definitely a wait until almost the end for the big emotional reveal. I guess I was just a little impatient.Honoria spent her childhood chasing around her brother and Marcus wanting to play and be part of the fun the boys were having. She had even been nicknamed \u2018bug\u2019 by them. She has known Marcus forever it seems and is probably the only person that realizes that under that frosty fa\u00e7ade is a kind man who is just a bit shy. She has thought about him as a brother for much of her life until she realizes that those feelings might not be entirely brotherly affection after all.Marcus grew up an only child and was really alone until meeting Daniel. They became best friends and Marcus loved spending time with his very messy and large family. So when Daniel was driven out of the country he agreed to look after Honoria and make sure she found a suitable husband. What he didn't know was that Honoria is desperate to find a husband this season as she now feels completely alone too with the loss of her brother and the emptiness of the house they all grew up in. Everything starts to go wrong when a plan involving a shovel, a small hole and a damsel in distress goes awry. The beginning was so cute and I really loved it. The time they spent together as children up to Marcus catching Honoria putting her plan into place. However the middle dragged a bit for me and I really wanted some more romantic interludes to happen up to this point. But due to Marcus\u2019s situation they were really subdued. It is a cute story and I really enjoyed the ending as well, especially the big reveal of emotions was a fantastic speech. It is a fun story but maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start my foray into Julia Quinn. The writing is good and I can see why she is such a popular novelist. I have been told that the Bridgerton series is like crack so I will move on to that next.Recommended for those who like friends to lover stories and don\u2019t mind waiting until the 11th hour for a little boom-chicka-bow-wow in their Historical Romances."}, {"userName": "Rane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1987431-rane", "userReview": "This was the perfect pick-me-upper- beach read. It had all of JQ's humor and trademarks (with a few cameo appearances from characters some of her older books) The book was light and airy and while not as strong as her other books, it did give a great insight into the infamous Smythe-Smith family and their tone-deaf love for music.  The book didn't feel very much like a full length novel as much of the action and story was taken with the heroine nursing back to health the hero and the hero and heroine Marcus & Honoria not knowing where they stood in each other's hearts.

I'm hoping that those books are better, not only because I already bought three of them, but because I'll be so disappointed if Julia Quinn isn't for me.This book wasn't bad, but honestly NOTHING happens. The heroine is sheltered and sweety, sweet, sweet, with just no meat on her. I wanted her to have some sort of spunk, some sort of personality to push the plot along. I felt very little chemistry between the two MCs, and all of the side character-relatives became confusing and distracting for me.

Who would have thought that sweet tarts and chocolates can make love so heavenly!\u201d\nI have been reading so many historical romance novels that I must have read almost every one, mainly works from Lisa Kleypas, Teresa Medeiros and Jennifer Ashley. But, this is the first novel I have read from Julia Quinn and it is called \u201cJust Like Heaven.\u201d Actually, \u201cJust Like Heaven\u201d is Julia Quinn\u2019s most recent book to date, so I had the pleasure of reading one of Julia Quinn\u2019s books. The story starts off with Honoria Smythe-Smith meeting up with her childhood friend Marcus Holroyd, who is the Earl of Chatteris and the two of them just claim that they are only friends. However, when a terrible tragedy strikes Marcus, when his leg is affected in an accident and he is struck by a terrible fever, both Marcus and Honoria will soon discover their true feelings for each other!I have read many historical romance novels where the hero and the heroine had an attraction for each other throughout the book. However, this is the first romance novel I have read where the hero and heroine start off as good friends and slowly start to realize their feelings for each other, which was quite unusual for me. Julia Quinn has done a great job at writing this story as the story is extremely cute and playful. I loved the way that Julia Quinn set up the conversations between the characters, especially between Honoria and her cousins as the dialogue that goes on between them is hilarious and comforting, as you can feel the close relationship that these cousins share with each other. I also loved the dialogue that Julia Quinn sets up between Marcus and Honoria as they always have friendly and spirited conversations between them that always make me smile every time I read them! It was also really cute seeing Marcus Holroyd go head over heels for Honoria Smythe-Smith as he clearly cannot understand these \u201clovely\u201d feelings he keep having and yet, he cannot stay away from Honoria. The story about Marcus\u2019s life as a child was heartwarming and sad as he had a lonely life as a child since he did not have a loving family like the Smythe-Smiths did. However, when he became like a little brother to the Smythe-Smith family, my heart just filled with joy at seeing Marcus being happy with this family! I also liked Honoria Smythe-Smith as she is so kind hearted and understanding towards Marcus\u2019s situation and the scene where Honoria was trying to help Marcus heal from his injury was probably the most emotional and wonderful scene in the entire book since it showed how much Honoria truly cares for Marcus.Notice that I have not mention much of a romance blossoming between Marcus and Honoria because this novel spends too much time with Marcus and Honoria trying to sort out their feelings for each other. That is not to say that this is a bad thing because I really did enjoy the friendly conversations that Marcus and Honoria had with each other, but as a fan of romance novels, it felt like there was not enough romance, fire and passion between the two of them to make me really believe that their love for each other is real. Marcus and Honoria\u2019s love for each other does not really show up until towards the end of the book and it felt like their relationship with each other was being forced towards the end instead of letting it naturally run along throughout the book. Also, there were many slow moments throughout this book that I was finding it hard to keep up with the story because there were scenes that dragged on for too long before they got to the exciting part of the story. Overall, \u201cJust Like Heaven\u201d is a really cute story for romance fans who love stories where the hero and heroine start out as friends and then become lovers. Also, this novel is great for readers who are uncomfortable with sex scenes since this novel does not contain too many sex scenes. Now that I am interested in Julia Quinn\u2019s books, I think I will check out her \u201cBridgerton\u201d series!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Carolyn  Storer", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2449271-carolyn-storer", "userReview": "I have a bit of a soft spot for historical romance since I began reading the genre last year, but I'd never read one of the most loved authors within this genre. I have heard from many sources that Quinn is a wonderful writer and now having read a novel I couldn't agree more.\"Just Like Heaven\" is brilliantly written and just so witty. It's sparkly, lively and funny. The writing is smooth and the dialogue realistic, so much so I didn't realise how many pages I had read before I realised I had nearly finished the book. I literally couldn't put it down.The characters are endearing and lovable, with substance and heart. Honoria is a sweet character, she's caring and trusting. Marcus is a complete gentleman who pretends to be brooding when in fact he has a charming sense of humour and is totally adorable. In fact there isn't really one character in the entire novel who is disagreeable.Honoria and Marcus have known each other since they were children, when Marcus became best friends with her brother Daniel. The prologue sets the scene of when they were children and then chapter one moves forward to the current day.Daniel has fled the country due to a duel gone wrong, Honoria is searching for a husband and Marcus is now Lord Chatteris with a large estate and healthy bank balance.Before Daniel leaves he makes Marcus promise to look after Honoria, which he does, by chasing away all potential suitors. On one particular occasion there is an accident (which I won't go into as it's hilarious and don't want to spoil it for you), and Marcus hurts his ankle. Of course things go from bad to worse when Honoria has to leave him to go and fetch help. It starts pouring with rain, Marcus's ankle swells to such an extent his boot has to be cut off, where upon his butler cuts his leg while doing so, and Marcus catches the flu.While taking care of Marcus, Honoira realises she loves him and, when not in the throws of fever, Marcus realises he's in love with her, but neither let on to the other about their feelings.The supporting cast of characters are just as well written and I loved each of them. The quartet consists of Iris, Daisy, Sarah and of course Honoria. They play as a quartet and are utterly dreadful and know this themselves, which is why they are dreading the traditional Musicale that they put on each year. I really enjoyed the light-hearted bickering between these characters and it was a great distraction from the romance. It balanced the book well.The only aspect I didn't like as much as the rest of the book were the last couple of chapters. It was rather rushed. Honoria and Marcus have a sensual moment, Daniel returns from abroad, Daniel and Marcus fight, Marcus threatens to punch a man who's not been nice to Honoria, and then he pops the question! All in the span of a few pages - phew!However, the true ending is sweet and satisfying and just what you would expect from an historical romance, so if you love HEA then you'll love this.VERDICT:\"Just Like Heaven\" is a wonderfully light and witty historical romance full of delightful characters. A real treat."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "This is really a comedy much more than a romance. The book is hilarious. However, if you are reading it for kissing, and romance, and sex, you are barking up the wrong tree. This is a fluffy, sweet, very funny story in which two people happen to fall in love.Marcus Holroyd, Earl of Chatteris, grew up with no mother and a distant father. Luckily he was sent away to school when he was 12, where he met his best friend Daniel.Daniel has a lot of sisters, most notably one 5 years younger than Marcus, little Honoria Smythe-Smith. Yes, Smythe-Smith. LOL Anyway, they grow up together, behaving much like brother and sister - teasing, crying, comforting, etc. So much so that even now when Marcus is no longer 'Marcus' but instead 'the Earl,' he and Honoria still share a close bond.Daniel, Marcus's best friend and Honoria's older brother, has fled the country. Before leaving he charged Marcus with keeping an eye out for his little sister, and Marcus has been discreetly scaring off potential husbands ever since.However, he didn't plan on falling for her himself......I haven't laughed so hard while reading a book in years. I was expecting a romance novel, but instead I was presented with this delightful comedy.Honoria is a bit daft. But you know what? So is Marcus. Their bumbling and harebrained schemes lead to some hilarious situations. I laughed out loud at least 10 times.This book doesn't really focus on physical love that much. If you are looking for heated glances, delicious kisses, and mindblowing sex - look elsewhere. This is more about sweetness and overall comedy.Another aspect that is important to address is that the whole thing could be seen as a little incestuous. I mean, Marcus and Honoria didn't grow up together, exactly - but they sure spent a lot of time together as kids. And she's five years younger than him. Wouldn't it rather be like dating your younger sister? Quinn does her best to avoid this, and she does a good job - it didn't feel too squicky for me, but the whole beginning of the book is strong with that annoying younger sister/protective older brother dynamic to the relationship. If that kind of thing really bothers you (I guess a lot of girls get crushes on their older brother's friends? Seems strange to me but I guess it's common) then I suggest avoiding this.Overall, 3 REAL STARS because Quinn made me laugh my head off, but only 1 ROMANCE STAR because it wasn't very romance-y.P.S. I can't help but notice that the Spanish version of this is called Un romance adorable, which I think sums up the whole thing nicely."}, {"userName": "Autumn  ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4261004-autumn", "userReview": "Bah! .. whatever happened to JQ???

Smythe-Smith. If you have read any of her books you would have heard about the Smythe-Smith Musicale the most anticipated and by that I mean dreaded social event in the ton calander. Honoria Smith-Smythe plays the violin, terribly ofcourse in true Smythe-Smith tradition, in the quartet and she hopes that this will be her final year as she is desparate to get married and start a family of her own; however, what she doesn't realize is that Lord Chatteris her older brothers best friend, has been looking out for her and scaring away all potential suitors as they all seem to him unsuitable. The more he sees of Honoria the more he comes to the realization that he may actually love her...I managed to read this book in a day; I just couldn't put it down. It was everything I have come to expect from a Julia Quinn book, funny, romantic and cute. As in most of her books the characters are funny and lighthearted, there is no real angst or darkness in this book so if you are looking for a broody read this isn't for you. However, if you want a book that will have you smiling and laughing all the way through then I recommend that you pick this up. Honoria was quirky and fun and I liked her immensley, she had a dry wit and I often found myself laughing at the things that she said or did. Marcus was also very sweet and quite adorabley shy! You could see from the start that they were perfect for eachother and it was great fun watching them finally come to that realization themselves.This was a great read and anybody looking for a light hearted funny book should give this book a try.Favourite Quote:He rather hoped he was sleeping, because he was quite certain he'd seen a six-foot rabbit hopping through his bedchamber, and if that wasn't a dream they were all in very big troule.

Quinn is one of the few historical romance authors out there whose books actually sound like a historical and the tone remains consistent throughout the book.The h/h (Marcus and Honoria) start off as friends of sorts from childhood. The hero is older and is friends with the heroine\u2019s brother. She\u2019s a kind of tag-along nuisance always wanting her brother and his friend to play at tea time with her as well as other little girl games. Some of these scenes are way too funny especially when Honoria tries to insinuate herself into every single activity the two boys set out to do and then pitches a fit if they don\u2019t let her. She\u2019s a bit of a pest as a kid but that changes as she gets older. When the two get together again as adults she finds out that her brother (who\u2019s been forced to leave the country) asked Marcus to keep an eye on her and help her make a good match. Marcus is somewhat \u201coverzealous\u201d in this and poor Honoria can\u2019t get anyone. Their relationship starts to spark after she helps him through a difficult time. Though there could have been a few more steam scenes, the strong writing makes up for it and still keeps you turning those pages.There are some great scenes between the younger cousins in the Smythe-Smythe family/quartet giving you that Bridgerton family feel. Those of you who\u2019ve read the Bridgertons will now know how the Smythe-Smith musicales got started and how some of these girls really are tone deaf (lol!) Quinn did a great job with their scenes making the reader feel like they could see the conversation/sniping/gossiping/arguing etc going on. Some of the Bridgertons reappear which was nice to see too. One of the funniest parts was that in nearly all of her series Quinn includes the famous romance book \u201cMrs Butterworth and the Mad Baron\u201d and it\u2019s back in this one too. It\u2019s the kind of book that just leaves you smiling, happy and all warm-and- fuzzy inside. A good start to a new and promising series."}, {"userName": "[Aengell]", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7221205-aengell", "userReview": "5 sweet, sweet, sweet, lovely BR with Iliada starsI wasn\u2019t a big fan of \u201cknown each other a lifetime\u201d, \u201cfriends to lovers\u201d themes, but Julia Quinn hooked me up. This story was so enticing, charming, cute and romantic, that I felt all giddy inside. It wasn\u2019t dragging at all, and there were many many cousins, mothers and great-great-aunts on the side who created a big, chaotic mess of secondary characters who were just \nadorable\n. The main characters, Honoria and Marcus, were too sweet to be true, they had great chemistry but what I loved (and I love this about every JQ book) was the fact that they had a real relationship growing, they talked and interacted and were playful and in love, and my enjoyment was not clouded by heavy sexual scenes. No, every time they touched felt like magic, just like it should be. Honoria as the heroine was quirky, funny, talking a little bit too much, but perfect in her own way. She wasn\u2019t too stubborn, like nearly every heroine in Romanceland tends to be, but just honest with her feelings, especially showing those feelings. Marcus wormed his way straight to my heart with his aloofness, hiding his sweet and tender heart. He was the perfect beta-hero who showed off his macho-side in the end. Marcus, you can be shy all you want! I just can repeat myself: this was so entertaining and addicting and I\u2019m more than curious to read Daniel\u2019s story. I know that many of my GR-friends weren\u2019t as excited about this one, but surely it isn\u2019t the same we are talking about!"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43590760-sara", "userReview": "Decididamente n\u00e3o t\u00e3o bom como a fam\u00edlia Bridgerton (por falar nisso, foi maravilhoso rever algumas personagens!).

In this book, we meet Lady Honoria Smythe-Smith who plays violin in the musicale and Marcus Holroyd, Earl of Chatteris. Marcus is the best friend of Honoria's older brother Daniel who is living in exile in Italy for reasons that are explained in the first few chapters. Daniel and Marcus have been friends for years and Marcus has become a type of surrogate son for the Smythe-Smiths. Before Daniel left, he made Marcus promise to watch over Honoria and make sure she does not marry anybody unsuitable. Therefore, Marcus, despite his lack of interest in society, goes to London every year to keep an eye on Honoria. What follows is a beautiful yet subtle tale of friends becoming lovers. Honoria and Marcus have known each other since childhood and are aware of quirks and personality traits. Honoria is an intelligent and kind young lady who values her family and their traditions. This viewpoint helps explain her willingness to go along with the family musicale despite her lack of talent. She knows she is bad, but is determined to have fun while performing for her family and friends. She also dreams of having a family of her own. As the youngest in her family, Honoria has always had a sense of loneliness especially after her brother's exile. Marcus's mother died when he was young and his father had little interest in his son beyond preping an heir. He had no siblings or even friends until he met Daniel Smythe-Smith at school. Because of Daniel, Marcus found the family he never had. Like Honoria, Marcus is a lonely person who desires a family of his own. Through a variety of comedic and dramatic events, Honoria and Marcus become close friends and begin to realize their feelings for each other. I was particularly drawn to a scene where Marcus had fallen ill and Honoria strived to nurse him back to health. The intimacy of this event caused them to look at each other in a way beyond friends. In terms of secondary characters, we are introduced to the other members of the Smythe-Smith Quartet: Sarah, Iris, and Daisy. Each of these girls has a unique personality as well as unique viewpoint on the musicale. I am definitely intrigued by Iris, the cellist who is actually talented, as well as the other girls. The whole Smythe-Smith family and their interactions with each other are fascinating and heartwarming. I cannot wait to read more about these girls and their happily ever afters.My favorite quote from this book is when Marcus is thinking about his relationship with Honoria and his dreams about that relationship:\"He hated being the center of attention, but by God, he wanted to be the center of her attention.\"  \"Just Like Heaven\" is the story of two people who fall in love after years of interaction. While it may sound simple and it is, I feel like Julia Quinn made it subtle yet powerful at the same time.

Though it\u2019s a question of rating it 0.25 stars more than I have, or not \u2013 but that raises the rating on Goodreads from 4 stars to 5 (since I\u2019m thinking of rating this either 4.50 or 4.75).Right, so. I\u2019ve now dipped into three series by this author. All of which are connected to each other. The first series I dipped into, oddly enough, is also one that I\u2019ve only read one book by \u2013 both because there were no other books in the series when I started; and because, when more books (1 more) appeared, I . . . wasn\u2019t feeling happy with the author and the book itself didn\u2019t look that interesting. I mean, the concept from the beginning \u2013 the underlying theme, is lying (reminder: I\u2019m not talking about the book this review appears on, I\u2019m referring to the second book in the Rokesbys series). Right, that\u2019s a muddle, let\u2019s try that again.I\u2019ve dipped into three series by Quinn. First series I tried was the Rokesbys series, a prequel series to the Bridgertons series. Loved the first book, but haven\u2019t read any other Rokesbys book. Then I read . . . most of the Bridgertons books \u2013 all 8 of them. Most because I had to DNF one of them. Bridgertons being about, unless I confused myself, the generation of marriageable adults that came after the generation in Rokesbys. This book here, the book this review is supposed to be about but hasn\u2019t been yet, is a side series instead of a prequel or sequel series. As in, the events in this series takes place during the same time period as the events in the Bridgertons series. Barely, but still. This specific book here, chronologically, slides in-between book 7 and book 8 of the Bridgertons series. About three years, if I were to base this on the age of Gregory instead of dates since I don\u2019t remember the actual dates, prior to book 8 (Gregory\u2019s book). Gregory and Colin make cameos in this book. Oddly, and I only really recalled it now \u2013 but Gregory got talked about a lot \u2013 invited to a party, was a member of that party, was talked about as a potential husband material . . . but didn\u2019t really appear in this book. Colin, on the other hand, was never talked about \u2013 at all \u2013 yet had an important scene in the book. There might have been another Bridgertons pop up in this book, but I don\u2019t recall any. The very old woman who feels free to say whatever she wants, but whose name now escapes me (Lady . . . Ddd . . d . . D something), also plays a somewhat important role in one (or two, but it\u2019s connected) scenes.The story is about \u2026 I hate when book descriptions fail to include the main character\u2019s names in them. Bah. Honoria Smythe-Smith is the lead female character (and yes there are two points of views in this book). Honoria comes from a large family, just like the Bridgertons (I do not recall if an exact number was mentioned for Honoria\u2019s family), but Honoria is like Gregory and Hynacith \u2013 near the end of the line (or the end), but unlike those two, she doesn\u2019t have anyone nearish her own age. So she both experiences a large family and . . . being lonely in a large home \u2013 what with her older siblings off doing their own thing. She does \u2018pester\u2019 on of her siblings, though \u2013 mostly because he\u2019s close enough in age, roughly 5 years, that she can try to do stuff with him. Unfortunately Daniel wants nothing to do with \u2018Bug\u2019. And would have nothing to do with her but for her persistence and the empathy of Marcus, Daniel\u2019s friend from Eton.Marcus, Earl . . . something or other, comes from a very small family. There\u2019s him and . . . . there\u2019s him. His father got his mother with child (don\u2019t worry, they were married at the time), and when the mother died when Marcus was . . . 5? some suggested the father marry again to increase the number of potential heirs. Father, though, gazed upon his son and found him intelligent enough and stuff. And had no desire to reenter the marriage market and heaven forbid actually deal with another wife. He was content with just the one child. Not that he talked much him until the kid was about 12, whereupon the kid was mostly off at Eton anyway \u2013 so father and son rarely saw each other. Mother and son, while mother was alive, were also in favor of the stand-offish parenting style.The book begins with Marcus meeting Honoria and her family, through brother Daniel \u2013 and being, basically, made a member of their family. That\u2019s the prologue. The actual story starts off with Honoria caught out in the rain in Cambridge, and being helped, temporarily, by an Earl \u2013 Marcus. They are still . . . friendly-ish, but they haven\u2019t spent much time near each other for the last three years \u2013 ever since \u2018that thing with Daniel\u2019 occurred. Marcus and Honoria reconnect. Etc. Etc. Honoria is in her third season and is determined to find a husband before the end (well, during it, the season hasn\u2019t started yet). Her mother isn\u2019t much help, though, because she\u2019s become withdrawn these last three years \u2013 though there\u2019s every indication that she was like Violet Bridgertons for her other children. Those who have read the Bridgertons series will recall that the Smythe-Smith put on music recitals \u2013 and that plays an important role in this book as well. Well, it would have to since Honoria is a member of the performing quartet. Marcus is strong, muscular, \u2018with money\u2019, and \u2018highly titled, plus he doesn\u2019t appear to be beast like (though no one seems to call him handsome, just not beast like). Oh, and he\u2019s shy-ish and doesn\u2019t like parties, crowds, London, or the \u2018season\u2019. He spends the book near Honoria . . . for reasons.I rather enjoyed this book from, mostly, beginning to end. I was a little concerned, though, when the beginning didn\u2019t see that humorous to me. Since the reviews seemed to indicate that this was more of a comedy than a romance book ()+\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013+Dang it. My word processor just died. mmphs. Now I have to actually write in the box here on Goodreads. Though I was able to get the review up to now. mmphs.Where was I? Book was said to be funny. I didn't see it at first. But was funny, eventually. There's a medical issue that crops up - I liked how that was described and even found humor there. As is somewhat normal, I kind of just skimmed along when the sex turned up - I do not, in general, enjoy reading the really long sex scenes this author writes, though there might occasionally be funny moments - more often there are . . . potential moments of me wishing to not continue reading due to the . . . stuff . . . let's move on.I liked the side characters, for the most part, especially Iris and Sarah from the Quartet. Though I had trouble telling the parents apart - Honoria's, Iris's and Sarah's (were all of them there? I'm not even sure, though I know . . . um . . at least two mothers were involved in the story).Rating: 4.50May 3 2018"}, {"userName": "Ana", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18630059-ana", "userReview": "Julia Quinn \u00e9 das minhas autoras preferidas!

But it was fun to see familiar fleeting moments from a new point of view."}, {"userName": "Carol *Young at Heart Oldie*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3752204-carol-young-at-heart-oldie", "userReview": "Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series is a great favourite of mine and those who have read the series will be familiar with the Smythe-Smith quartet. For those readers who are unfamiliar with the Bridgerton books, the quartet of three sisters and a cousin gives an annual musical performance which can only be described as a discordant cacophony of sounds! So I was delighted to discover that Ms Quinn's new series features the young ladies of this quartet. The first book, JUST LIKE HEAVEN, is a delightful story full of romance, charm and humor.Marcus Holroyd's childhood is a very unhappy one. His parents provide him with the best wet nurses, nannies and tutors but fail to give him what he really wants, their love and attention. Neither does he have any friends because the local children are either too young, too old, or lack the correct social standing. At the age of twelve, he is sent to Eton, an event which will change his whole life. There he is befriended by Daniel Smythe-Smith and soon finds himself spending his holidays with the large and noisy Smythe-Smith family, something he relishes. Marcus is constantly plagued by Daniel's youngest sister, the six-year-old Honoria and over the years, they become close friends. When Daniel is forced to flee to the continent, he makes Marcus (now the Earl of Chatteris) promise to keep an eye on Honoria to ensure she doesn't marry someone unworthy of her. Unforeseen events lead Honoria and Marcus to examine their true feelings for each other, but it will take the astute Lady Danbury, a certain Colin Bridgerton (he of the famous charm and sparkling eyes), lucky red shoes and a heartfelt declaration before they finally admit their love for each.Feeling down? Well this book is the ideal cure! It has no great conflict, no heartrending angst and no threatening villains but I loved escaping into the cosy world Ms Quinn has created with its enchanting friends-to-lovers story and appealing hero and heroine. I adore Marcus and Honoria because neither of them conforms to the typical hero and heroine you find in so many books. Marcus is not one of those drop dead gorgeous rakes whom every woman drools over. In fact, he's shy, not particularly handsome and hates being the centre of attention. Honoria is very down to earth, honest, loves getting together with her cousins just to chat and longs for a husband, her own home and a big family. I found it easy to relate to them because they seemed so much like real people.Marcus's illness provides the impetus for them to recognise that their feelings for each other are something more than friendship. Some reviewers have complained that Ms Quinn devotes an inordinate amount of the book to Marcus's illness but I feel that these scenes are integral to the story because they reveal Honoria and Marcus's innermost thoughts about each other and move their relationship forward to the next level. They also serve to highlight Honoria's single-mindedness and courage in the face of adversity. Ms Quinn also manages to blend in touches of her trademark humor as well. I love Honoria's chatter to Marcus, even though he can't hear her: \"I am thinking that when you are better you should come to London.\" Honoria went on, fixing her voice back into a facsimile of good cheer. \"If nothing else, you will need a new pair of boots. Maybe something of a looser fit. It's not the style, I know, but perhaps you can set a new trend.\" I'd probably be just like Honoria, babbling a lot of trivialities, if I were sick with worry!Marcus's laudanum induced hallucination is also very funny:He might have slept for a bit. He rather hoped he was sleeping, because he was quite certain he'd seen a six-foot rabbit hopping through his bedchamber, and if that wasn't a dream, they were in big trouble. I love how Ms Quinn emphasises the importance of family and friends, something that seems sadly missing in our 21stcentury society. Marcus values his friendship with Daniel and the sense of family he finds with the Smythe-Smiths because he'd never experienced either before. For Honoria, family means everything, and although she knows how truly dreadful they are, upholding the tradition of the musical performance is very important to her. She regards her cousins as friends as well as family and loves the rehearsals because it gives her the opportunity to simply chat with them.Marcus and Honoria's first kiss seems a natural progression and in perfect harmony with the story. Honoria is so happy to see Marcus recovered that she's sobbing and naturally throws her arms around him and then:\"Honoria\", he whispered, looking down at her as if he'd never seen her before. His eyes were warm, chocolaty brown and rich with emotion. Something flared in their depths, something she didn't quite recognise, and slowly, ever so slowly, his lips dipped to meet hers. Beautifully romantic!Marcus has always found Honoria's \u2018lucky red shoes' a turn on and it is these shoes that ultimately propel the action towards the big love scene which is really worth waiting for! Ms Quinn doesn't do steamy but her scene is both tender and poignant with lovely touches of teasing between them.The Smythe-Smith Quartet themselves provide some really funny moments with their friendly bickering and it is a bonus to meet some familiar characters from the Bridgerton series including my favourite, Colin Bridgerton and the indomitable Lady Danbury.If you are in the mood for a tender romance with endearing characters, sparkling dialogue and delightful touches of humor, JUST LIKE HEAVEN is simply perfect. I'm now looking forward to reading the other books in this series but will be sure to have my earplugs at the ready!http://www.theromancereviews.com/view...This review was originally written for The Romance Reviews (TRR)"}, {"userName": "Caz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4368838-caz", "userReview": "The perfect piece of audio-fluff for when - as I am - you're laid up in bed with a stinking cold and can't read a book because it makes your eyes ache!It's classic JQ - light-hearted, with plenty of witty dialogue; and it contains one of my favourite tropes, the \"friends-to-lovers\" one.Lady Honoria has known Marcus Holroyd since she was a child. He's her big brother's best friend, the only child of an only child who has been given the best of everything in life - except familial life and affection. It's a miracle he hasn't grown up a complete head-case, but he's a genuinely nice guy; shy, somewhat reclusive and possessing a dry wit which he generally keeps hidden.Honoria is the youngest of her siblings by well over ten years, and as her sisters are all married and her brother Daniel (we get his story in A Night Like This) had to leave the country, she is terribly lonely and desperate to find a husband so that she can have a home of her own. Most of all, she hates the silence. Having grown up in a large, bustling household, there is now just her and her mother, who has become very withdrawn since Daniel's departure.When Marcus becomes desperately ill, Honaria insists on going to him; and threatens to go alone when her mother demurs. Fortunately, her mother relents and the pair head off to Marcus' Cambridgeshire estate where they discover him to be in far more danger than they had believed. Seeing her son's best friend in such dire straits seems to give Honoria's mother the kick up the backside she needed to pull her out of her listlessness and together, she and Honaria work tirelessly to save Marcus' life.There are some truly tender scenes - between mother and daughter and Marcus and Honaria - in that part of the book. Although they more or less grew up together, the couple have not been especially close in recent years - although unbeknownst to Honaria, before Daniel left, he asked Marcus to keep an eye on her and \"stop her marrying an idiot\". As he recovers, the two draw closer and begin to realise the true nature of their feelings for each other.There's a bump along the road to true love when Honaria discovers that Marcus had chased off a number of her suitors the previous year and gets huffy about it - but really, it's a mole-hill (see what I did there?) rather than a mountain and doesn't take long to sort out.Both protagonists are attractive characters. Marcus isn't a rake or man with a dark secret in his past, he's just a truly decent man who doesn't like to be the centre of attention (although when push comes to shove, he'll do it if he has to) and who wants to be loved and have a family of his own around him.Honoria is no silly debutante. She's kind and funny and fiercely loyal to her family and its traditions. She's one of the few people to truly 'see' Marcus for what he is underneath the rather starchy exterior he presents to the world; and even though she worries that his attentions to her have been a result of his promise to her brother, she is sensible enough to realise she's wrong and that he does truly care for her.If I have a criticism, it's that the sex scene was really not necessary. I have no objection to sex in romance novels, but it felt like it had been shoe-horned in here for the sake of it.Rosalyn Landor did her usual superb job with the narration. There are five or six different female characters featured throughout the novel, and in some scenes, they all appear - but each voice is clearly delineated so there is never any doubt as to who is speaking. The narrative passages are well-paced and invested with the lightness of tone and humour that is prevalent throughout the story.Just what the doctor ordered!"}], "description": "Marcus Holroyd is the best friend of Honoria Smythe-Smith's brother, Daniel, who lives in exile out of the country.
