Bennett Monroe has the ability to travel through time and works on assignments given to him by the master that are responsible for keeping the timeline from ripping itself and the whole world apart. For these strange, and sometimes dangerous, assignments he occasionally works with Cynthia, another time-traveller and a friend of sorts. But now that Monroe has failed in an assignment, he is left with no other option but to take drastic actions with the help of his only friend and confidante. I liked the unique plot and storyline and enjoyed reading about Bennett and Cynthia\u2019s adventurous lives. This is a time-travel story, but the author has done a great job in adding a new twist to it and making it all the more interesting. So I\u2019m pretty sure that no matter how many time-traveling stories you\u2019ve already read, this one will not fail to fascinate you.The simplicity of the author\u2019s writing style made this book a very quick and a reasonably pleasant read. I was drawn into the story right from the beginning and was not able to put it aside until the time I finished reading the last sentence.This book has a very simplistic plot, but the characterization was really well done. I obviously liked the main character, Bennett Monroe, but I also liked Cynthia\u2019s character a lot. And to top it all off, Bennett\u2019s backstory was really well done and made this book all the more interesting and emotionally engaging.I absolutely loved reading this book! It is a light-hearted Science-Fiction read and I\u2019d highly recommend it to everyone who wants to read a decent time-travel novella.You can also read this review at The Reading Bud."}, {"userName": "Danielle Tremblay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13712421-danielle-tremblay", "userReview": "[the first mission consisted in convincing Bennett's parents to abandon him when he was only ten years old (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jacque Baker", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42691188-jacque-baker", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this novella. The author while changing time scenes frequently kept me engaged with the mystery of who Bennett and Cynthia truly are. The story is richly descriptive and full of adventure, romance and mystery all the while engagingly traveling through time at the behest of a Master that neither Bennett nor Cynthia have been able to figure out. It has well crafted twists and turns through out the plot line ..I highly recommend this well done time-travel."}, {"userName": "Karen Turner", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50551865-karen-turner", "userReview": "I loved the book.

Bennett not only has to deal with his strange gift; he also has to handle a teetering madman he reluctantly calls 'master, ' and the parents who abandoned him. Bennetts day went from bad to worse.
