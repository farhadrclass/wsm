It's book two in Karin Kaufman's 'Juniper Grove Mystery' series. I loved the first and I loved this one. There are five total! I can't wait for the next one.These books are best read in order. Mystery writer Rachel Stowe moves back to her native Colorado after a disappointment in the big city of Boston. Now, she's solving real-life mysteries, along with her two new friends and cohorts in sleuthing. Now, if she can only get this police chief to look her way! Clever and well written, Kaufman's mysteries keep you guessing until the end. And if you want a tighter mystery and loads of suspense, try her Anna Denning Mystery series. It's wonderful!*I was given a complimentary copy of this book. All opinions are my own and honest."}, {"userName": "Jerri Cachero", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36906618-jerri-cachero", "userReview": "Halloween and murder is taking over the charming town of Juniper Grove, Colorado.This second book, in the series, kept me guessing and I loved the \"team\" - Rachel, Holly and Julia - swinging into action. The mystery was fast-paced and I changed my mind about the murderer several times! I loved the idea of using a scavenger hunt as a setting for murder, especially during Halloween. Not only did I enjoy the mystery, but also the descriptions of the town in October. The setting was rich, cozy and made me long for hot chocolate, cinnamon tea, sweaters, and of course, almond scones and cream puffs from Hollys's Sweets!I can't wait for my next visit to Juniper Grove!"}, {"userName": "FangirlNation", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48546466-fangirlnation", "userReview": "In Death of a Scavenger by Karin Kaufmsan, Rachel Stowe and her friend Holly, baker of the best cream puffs in Colorado, are taking part in Juniper Grove\u2019s annual October Scavenger Hunt when they see the participants all racing in one direction.

I enjoy reading her books. She writes about a mystery writer who tries to solve mysteries in her new little town. In Death of a Scavenger, Holly is accused of murder. Rachel Stowe is out to prove her friend innocent. Rachel uses her skills as a mystery writer to help solve the crime!

It\u2019s not that Rachel thinks Police Chief Gilroy is incompetent. Far from it. She\u2019s just afraid he\u2019s looking in the wrong places.Death of a Scavenger is book two in the Juniper Grove mystery series, and it\u2019s good to spend more time with these characters\u2026 and to vicariously enjoy the cream puffs from Holly\u2019s bakery.My favourite addition to the cast of characters is Gina, a grey-dreadlocked lady with mobility issues who lives in a brightly-painted house.Clues and diversions abound, along with more conflict with the ever-patient Chief Gilroy, and again Rachel plays a key part in solving the mystery.The Juniper Grove novels are short, quick reads. They\u2019re clean and not too intense \u2013 perfect for those times when you don\u2019t want anything too heavy. That said, the characters always leave you with something to think about, even if it\u2019s just the challenge to be kinder to someone who\u2019s marginalized like Gina.Karin Kaufman is also the author of the Anna Denning mystery series. Death of a Scavenger is the second in the Juniper Grove mystery series.
