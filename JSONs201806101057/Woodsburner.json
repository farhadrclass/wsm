Henry David Thoreau and his friend John Hoar have been fishing in Walden Pond on a hot, dry, windy day in May. John insists they light a fire in the woods so they can make fish stew from the day's catch. Henry (who's recently `rearranged' his name from David Henry) has misgivings but lights the fire anyway. The famous Walden Pond woods fire ensues. The fictional characters' stories intertwine with Thoreau's. Eliot Calvert, a Boston and hoping to be soon be, Concord book dealer, Odmund Hus, a Norweigian immigrant who's working as a hired hand for a local couple (he's in love with the wife), and Caleb, a troubled fundamentalist minister. It's fire that unites all four of these men. Henry lights the fire, Eliot is writing a play that ends with a conflagration, Odmund's family was killed in a shipboard fire upon landing in Concord, and Caleb is obsessed with the fires of Hell. All four men unite with other townsfolk to fight the fire. This is a fateful day in the men's lives. It's events change all of them. They gain new perspectives and even new lives. The book is well written and entertaining. The period details help it come alive. Pipkin does a great job of illustrating Thoreau's innate differentness and some events that had a huge impact in forming who he became. It helps put Thoreau in perspective of his time, place and events."}, {"userName": "Eileen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/938692-eileen", "userReview": "This novel just won the 2009 Mercantile Library/Center for Fiction's Best First Novel Prize!Move Pipkin's Woodsburner to the top of your reading pile! While Woodsburner is a novel about Henry David Thoreau, it manages to exceed or escape all of the ponderous transcendental baggage that could sink a good story. The Thoreau of the novel is a young pencilmaker who has not yet retreated to Walden; the fire he sets in the Concord woods is the result of a fish chowder gone wrong. Woodsburner is beautifully written, meticulously researched, thoughtful, sexy and funny all at the same time."}, {"userName": "Geoff Wyss", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2178777-geoff-wyss", "userReview": "An . . . interesting book, but I can't really recommend it. On a sentence-by-sentence (and sometimes paragraph-by-paragraph) level, it's often excellent. Pipkin is good at describing things (fire, the woods, sometimes people) and actions (a ship exploding, men fighting a forest fire). The writing is good enough often enough to hold you. But in larger ways--plot, characterization, theme, in other words all the most important stuff--the book is frequently maddening. The plot (which switches between a handful of characters in Concord on the day Thoreau started a fire in the woods) is full of cute contrivances, gimmicky connections between characters that, while not impossible, aren't believable--it's \"fiction\" through and through. And the book hits you over the head, at length and repeatedly, with its themes; there's barely any space for the reader to think. And the themes are obvious (though they might not seem so if they weren't stated so early and worked over so tiresomely). And about half of the main characters are nothing more than ideas worked out in human form. If Thoreau is not, it's only because Pipkin has so many (and such various) ideas to draw from in 'Walden."}, {"userName": "James Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy", "userReview": "On an April day in 1844 Henry David Thoreau and a friend accidentally caused a fire that consumed about 300 acres of timber and threatened the town of Concord. Woodsburner is about that fire and about how it affects the lives of the novel's wonderful ensemble of characters. Because each of those characters is identified with a fire other than the Concord fire, one could almost say it's a novel about fire. Each character has a fire in their life and it means different things to each of them. Because I thought the novel trolled deeper waters than fire being several ideas of hell, I tried to look beyond that. Still, I think it's part of Pipkin's scheme. Toward the end of the novel is a description of the men as shadows desperately fighting the leading edge of the fire with hoe and shovel amid the terrible smoke and heat. That seemed pointed to me. But fire here is many things. To one it may signify guilt while to another it may be as simple as the taste of fire on his tongue when he takes a sip of whiskey. Thoreau, who startd the fire and soon became amazed at the size and uncontainable nature of it, thought of it as existence itself, before which he was helpless. What I believe is one of Pipkin's conclusions is that fire is redemptive. Concord was, as we know, one of the centers of transcendentalist thought in the 19th century, thought which is in some ways similar to Buddhism. So I wonder if we're not supposed to think of fire in the purifying terms of Buddhism. Thinking in that way, fire redeems. Each fire becomes a way these characters cleanse themselves. The novel's final section is set in time after the Concord fire. The characters have progressed in their personal narratives yet fire is still a part of each life. Those who have reached a state of grace are those who learn to control the fire in their life, whether building a roaring campfire or roasting coffee beans over an open flame. For a reader like me, fascinated with Alcott and Thoreau and Emerson and the little Concord world they inhabited, it's all wonderfully imagined and reconstructed in Woodsburner, right down to the language of the period. Surprisingly, I thought Thoreau the least interesting of the characters. Perhaps we know so much about him that Pipkin's imagination in making a young Thoreau was smothered before it could ignite him into energetic flame. Beginning the novel I'd thought Thoreau was to be the main character. Instead, I now believe it to be a man named Oddmund Hus, himself the most natural character in the novel and able to teach Thoreau a thing or two. It's just one of the interesting twists making this a wonderful novel, fully realized and hard to put down."}, {"userName": "Jim Neeley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6127111-jim-neeley", "userReview": "A disappoinment, but an interesting read. I would compare it, in a sense, to an overly produced album, next to a roughly produced low -fi album. One may be technically accomplished but the later has more heart. Woodsburner was an overly produced album, created in a state of the art studio by a good technician. This book, in its description, purported to be about Henry David Thoreau starting a forest fire in Concord just before he moved to Walden Woods, a topic which interested me immensely. Partially it was. It is a fiction, so I did not expect a historical narrative. I did though expect more Thoreau in it, of the 37 chapters; he was the main character focus of only 8, and mentioned only in passing in others. The other chapters concern other residents of Concord and Boston, on that particular day, which are effected by the fire. Some of their stories interested me greatly, especially Reverend Caleb , although I did not like at all the surprise ending of his story, 1t should have been left with him walking into the forest fire. I did like the forays into old Boston, having spent some time living there, I could picture the area. Not the wealthy Louisburg Square, but a crowded and noisy, with manure strewn streets leading to opium dens. The character stories all intersect together by the end, but I had long since stopped caring about most of them. There were also sexual scenes and story lines, which seemed to me, included solely for the sake of shock value (shocking at an academic dinner party). Not to give anything away, but Oddmund\u2019s relation to the pumpkins, was completely unbelievable. The colonial pornography story line, at first seemed realistic, but soon took on a modern slant that didn't fit the pre-civil war times. I do not deny pornography existed then, it did in Pompeii, but I do not think this was a truthful or historic portrayal. I do think Pipkin got Thoreau's reaction to the fire correct. I'm also reading Walden and can see Thoreau trying to justify the fire being something more than his own stupid mistake, of trying to light a fire on a windy dry day."}, {"userName": "Alice Meloy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2600421-alice-meloy", "userReview": "The premise of the book is a true story: Henry David Thoreau one day accidentally set a fire that spread and burned down 300 acres of the woods near Concord, Massachusetts. This was BEFORE he moved to a cabin on Walden Pond and wrote his famous book, and could have been the impetus for his decision to stop making pencils for his father and start contemplating philosophy and nature. At least that's what Pipkin would have us think happened in this beautifully written debut novel that explores the events of the day of the fire in the lives of Thoreau and several other individuals who were in or near Concord that day. As he fleshes out the characters in his story, Pipkin does a masterful job of creating the zeitgeist of early 19th century America.

The forest along the banks was dangerously dry, but one of the young men started a campfire anyway. Encouraged by a brisk wind, the flames quickly spread to the grass and then to the pines and birch trees. Before the end of that awful day, 300 acres had been reduced to ash.You know this accidental arsonist as the world's most famous naturalist, Henry David Thoreau. But to the aggrieved men of Concord, he was known for many years as that \"damned rascal,\" the \"Woodsburner.\" Not surprisingly, Thoreau didn't refer to this incident in his classic meditation on nature, \"Walden; or, Life in the Woods.\" He couldn't even bring himself to mention it in his own journal until six years after the fact, when he finally described the fire with such shameless pride and self-justification that you want to slap him upside his Transcendental head.But now, 165 years later, that awful day finally bursts back into flame. John Pipkin's brooding first novel, \"Woodsburner,\" starts on the morning of April 30, as Henry David squats on the bank of Fair Haven Bay and strikes a match he bummed from a shoemaker. The novel ends that evening, as the blackened forest glows in the darkness and soot snows down on the town of Concord. Over the course of this momentous day, Pipkin moves back in time and across the Atlantic, describing several other characters whose lives are lit by their own fires and altered by Thoreau's conflagration.The ingenious nature of this structure grows clearer with each haunting chapter. The fire that \"flows like brilliant liquid\" through Concord Woods is a natural engine for a terrifically exciting story, and Pipkin conveys such a visceral impression of the \"clever flames crouching in the branches\" that you can feel the heat radiating off these pages.You would expect Thoreau to dominate this story, but he falls away for long sections. When he does appear, though, he speaks and thinks in a mixture of innocence, self-righteousness, apprehension and nobility. Pipkin, who was born and raised in Baltimore, attends precisely to the details of Thoreau's life, his descriptions in \"The Journal\" and even the epigraphic phrases of \"Walden.\" The character who emerges is a rough-hewn preview of the polished icon that Thoreau has become. In the best sections, this lonely 26-year-old man is torn with grief over the recent death of his brother and anxiety about his future. (How long can he make pencils in his father's factory?) It's a portrait far more attentive to the complexity and turmoil of the man than we get in, say, Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee's popular sanctification of him in their play \"The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail.\"But just as captivating are those characters Pipkin has invented, men and women consumed by their own passions. They provide a fascinating impression of the nation when it was still young and swelling and struggling to define itself. They see the Concord fire through their own private flames -- fire is everywhere in this novel -- and Pipkin allows them to brush up against each other in the most subtle and ingenious ways.New England religious fever is represented by an itinerant preacher, a Gothic figure smelling of brimstone and appalled by Ralph Waldo Emerson's misty brand of Unitarianism. He's chosen this fiery April day to announce the construction of a church in the Concord woods. Haunted by the possibility that nothing lies beyond but \"a blank, empty, measureless abyss,\" the Rev. Caleb Dowdy has devised an infernal scheme to offend God so deeply that He will make His displeasure manifest in the physical world. Seeing the forest burst into flames is the proof he craves that \"the palsied hand of Providence\" is finally moving.Meanwhile, a snobbish bookstore owner has just arrived from Boston to survey his new store in Concord when the call goes up for firefighters. Eliot Calvert is a merchant worn down by the forces of commerce, the sort of figure suggested by Thoreau's stinging critique of the businessman in \"Walden.\" Once an aspiring (and hilariously awful) playwright, he sacrificed his artistic ambitions to satisfy the demands of his purse, imagining that each new concession to commercial success would give him the freedom he desires. (How depressing to read that even pre-Civil War bookstore owners felt they needed to clutter their shops with everything but books to make a profit. And of course, then as now, when nothing else will sell, there's always porn.) The Concord fire might afford him the chance for real heroism or artistic insight -- or deadly blunder. He's a brilliantly drawn character, ridiculous and pompous, but finally deeply sympathetic.But from start to finish \"Woodsburner\" belongs to a strange farmhand named Oddmund Hus (Odd for short, and for real). This painfully shy young man comes to the New World in the novel's most spectacular conflagration, an explosion in Boston Harbor that propels him to shore even as it kills the rest of his Norwegian family. His tumultuous upbringing in America and his efforts to tame his sexual urges display the remarkable texture of Pipkin's storytelling. A kind of precursor of the hermit Thoreau will eventually pretend to be in \"Walden,\" Odd lives alone in the woods, but unlike Thoreau, he burns with desire for a woman, the plump wife of his master. It's an irresistibly tender story, grounded in tragedy but flecked with some outrageously bawdy moments. When the alarm goes up in Concord, we can't tell whether this emergency will finally ignite his smoldering affections or send him fleeing deeper into the woods.At the end of the day, when the embers begin to cool and the various story lines in \"Woodsburner\" draw to a close, Odd is the character who burns brightest in this profound and thoughtful novel, but all of them will linger in your mind.http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/..."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1803012-sue", "userReview": "A friend gave me this book to read.

The set-up of \"Woodsburner\" is usually my favorite. An actual historical event happens, in this case the accidental fire in the woods near Concord MA in the mid-1800s, and the author tells us the stories of several individuals affected by the fire, switches back and forth between the individuals telling us their pasts as well as what their lives are now. Two of the stories, well, actually three, just weren't interesting to me. I couldn't relate to Eliot or Caleb at all, Thoreau wasn't that interesting either but since he was the one who set the fire I guess we're stuck with him. I did like Oddmund's story very much and wish there had been more on him and on Emma, the woman he loved. Anezka and Zalenka were also interesting and I would have liked to have read more about them.

Instead he has thoughts and mutters lines that simply confirm what anyone familiar with Walden already knows. To his credit, Pipkin seems to have figured out early that either he couldn't find a way into HDT's skin or that he was too intimidated to attempt stretching the real HDT into a fictional character that would lead to some new understanding of the historical man. What he lacks is the imagination of a Robert Graves inhabiting Claudius in \"I, Claudius,\" or of a Don DeLillo inhabiting Lee Harvey Oswald in \"Libra.\" To put it simply, he just doesn't do much with HDT. Therefore, he decided to cut his losses by limiting the number of appearances by the central historical figure and focusing on the fictional characters. Odd move for a historical novel, but one that might have worked better if he offered any sense of how Thoreau impacted the lives of these characters, or how he was influenced by them. Instead, HDT seems like a passing stranger in his own story. It's not just a question of failing to stretch our understanding of the real Thoreau through artifice; he fails to capture the full range of the rich persona HDT reveals in his own writing. We get the stereotypical cranky and dour \"hermit\" and none of the playful, inventive who took such delight in in people as eccentric as himself. The fictional characters are a mixed bag, ranging from a parody of a deranged New Awakening preacher consumed with proving the existence of sin and damnation to talentless would-be playwright who supports his failing book store by selling porn (an interesting if heavy-handed commentary on classic Thoreau lament re corruption of commercialism on American culture ) to an immigrant farm laborer haunted by the death of his family to ship fire during voyage to America. For the most part, the novel alternates chapters focusing on these three, with varying degrees of success, with the immigrant, \"Odd,\" the most fully developed (because he has the most at stake, the one character with a genuine need worth caring about), though all three seem designed to represent archtypes of the time that HDT either criticized or embraced in his writing. Pipkin does a good job of structuring this novel around the fire, describing its movement throughout the course of a single day and its impact on the fictional characters, as a kind of metaphorical purgative that either destroys or frees them in some way. And his descriptions of the fire are powerful, even beautiful, echoing HDT's view of nature as both trascendant force of destruction and recreation. Like a lot of talented first-time novelists, though, he doesn't know when to ease off the lyricism and rely on some basic exposition to move a story forward, giving the same level of ornate description to nearly every detail that passes before his eyes. This level of detail was most interesting when P. describes the family business of pencil-making; made me want to go out and buy a bunch of classic #2 pencils and spend the day doodling with one. A lot of scene-staging that bedazzles the eye but doesn't illuminate the mind. Clearly he knows the physical world he's describing; too bad he isn't as capable portraying the mind of the main person in that world.If you want a fuller, more complex view of Thoreau, read Richardon's marvelous biography Henry Thoreau, The Life of the Mind. Better yet, just read Thoreau himself. His writing persona is as rich and artful as any fictional character."}, {"userName": "Open Loop Press", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1865466-open-loop-press", "userReview": "In Woodsburner, John Pipkin's first work of historical fiction, the Henry David Thoreau whose shadow looms large over American letters is an uncertain artist, a contemplative pencil maker, and an accidental fire-starter.What lesson then, Henry asks himself, is his current experience awakening? He knew when he struck the match that there had been no rain for weeks. He knew the wind was strong, the grass dry, the woods asleep. These are not bits of innate wisdom; they are universal truths that transcend experience; these are the lessons that one pieces together from living. (Pg. 44.)Thus Thoreau, philosopher, environmentalist, champion of individualism, accidentally sets fire to the Concord Woods on April 30, 1844, beginning John Pipkin\u2019s exploration of five lives on the cusp of change. We meet a handful of Americans, each seeking a better life: an Evangelical preacher, a Norwegian immigrant, a housewife with a love of books, a playwright with a day job, and the young Thoreau, each of whom is, like their homeland, at a crossroads. So the broken peace of a New England afternoon offers us a look at America in transition. The War of Independence is at it\u2019s back and the Civil War is on the horizon; this is a country in search of its identity.And then a tree collapses across the line of men. No one is injured, but the fire crosses this bridge to new quarry and the flames spread to the trees flanking the men. Henry sees a dismal proof in this. Nature will not be outfoxed so long as chance is her ally. Men exhaust a disproportionate sum of energy in a vain effort to prevent nature from doing what she will: damming rivers, filling swamps, leveling hills, clearing fields, claiming land from the sea. The cities of America are the hosts of gratuitous transformation, aberrant changes that, once left unguarded, will revert to what was. (Pg. 275.)This little-known historical event, briefly mentioned in Thoreau\u2019s journals and cursorily covered in the papers of the day, is, in its brevity, rich soil for the writer\u2019s imagination. Could the fire, Pipkin wonders, have compelled Thoreau to go into the woods?Even when the wind blows away from town, the smell has so permeated carpets and curtains and clothing and living trees that the evidence of his guilt is discernable. People carry kerchiefs held to nose and mouth like bandits. The townspeople of Concord are grateful to have been spared, but their gratitude is soon overtaken by anger. Henry cannot walk the streets of Concord without suffering icy stares and hearing behind his back the angry, accusing whisper: woodsburner. (Pg. 361.)As Pipkin reveals the events of the day, he shows us we are not so different from the people of the past. They felt, as we feel, love and fear, excitement and fatigue, hope and doubt. This is the goal of John Pipkin\u2019s fiction: to show us, by awakening the imagination, that stories about the past have much to teach us about the present; they help us understand who we are today.~Carlin M.

Luckily, the fire was contained before it could reach nearby Walden Pond, where Thoreau would eventually live as a recluse and write his famous transcendentalist reflection,\nWalden, the following year.This book takes the Concord Woods fire of 1844 and uses it to frame an exploration into the minds and personalities of not only Thoreau, but also several other people whose lives were affected by the fire. A variety of narrators tell how and why they are in the Concord area on the day of the fire, and we come to know a range of different backgrounds and philosophies that might have been found in the New England area during the early 19th century.I enjoyed the deep, introspective writing style and intense description of events, but I felt mixed about the obvious environmentalist message being shoved into the reading. \"Man's inability to conceive of the world's limits does not render the world limitless. And there is no longer a new world for the empty-handed to flee to from here.\" I found those kind of pronouncements off-putting rather than inspiring. The author did such a good job of writing about the place and describing the fire, that he shouldn't need to explain and insert himself so much into the story. I'd suggest this book to anyone who has, or wants to enjoy the writings of Thoreau or any of the transcendentalist writers of the 19th century.

Emma, born in Ireland, the only survivor of the potato famine in her family to come to the New World to settle in Concord.3. Oddmund, the sole survivor of a fire on board a ship bound for the New World, living in Concord, alone as an orphan, to grow up in the woods in Concord, who falls in love with a woman, already married to an alcoholic, abusive man.4. Elliot, a bookseller in Boston, an aspiring playwright, planning to build another bookstore in Concord.5. Henry David Thoreau, sparks the fire that brings the closure to all their lives.The deep thoughts and philosophies of the characters drew me closer to each:Henry has always felt welcome among the trees, not as a visitor who comes for sport but, rather, as one returning home after long absence. But he wonders if some portion of the woods will understand that it was his careless hand that struck the match. Is recollection a faculty of man alone, or do all things in the world bear the imprint of what has come before? The mark of his deed, he thinks, might forever reside in the deep-ringed memories of the woods, entombed in the striated record underfoot. And after the fire - his fire - has finished its rampage, will the blackened survivors of this once green expanse ever again welcome his homecoming?\""}, {"userName": "Rich", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/140608-rich", "userReview": "Is a person's fate within their control, or is it written in the stars? John Pipkin explores the possibilities in this novel. It is well written and and engaging even as multiple characters, each with their own story and motivation are revealed.Each character struggles with who they currently are, and who they want to be; this makes Henry David Thoreau an excellent choice as one of the voices because most of his own writing is concerned with living deliberately.Thoreau's character has not yet embarked upon a path in life, indeed at the start of the book he decides to spend his time improving the family's pencil manufacturing business. By the book's conclusion he has resolved to spend time living apart (but not far from) his neighbors so that he can write his book memorializing his dead brother.Other characters present different facets: a bookseller who has compromised his dreams and morals for success, a preacher searching for absolute knowledge through the invocation of destruction, and finally, perhaps most importantly, an immigrant Oddmund Hus anxious to escape what he sees as his inherited destiny.The author's exploration of this idea is entertaining and the choice of Thoreau as the opening and \"binding\" character is masterful. The other characters are revealed as fascinating human beings with their all too real conflicting wants and needs. Some of the secondary characters are perhaps a little too obvious.I found this book to be engaging, thoughtful fiction which is all too rare. The book explores an interesting premise without falling back to long exposition, the lives of the characters are explanation enough."}, {"userName": "Thing Two", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3722823-thing-two", "userReview": "I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, it was full of beautiful sentences, vividly described scenes, and characters I could remember. The story is loosely based on an actual event in the life of David Henry Thoreau (who later became Henry David). The author did a good job of weaving the little amount known of the day Thoreau set fire to the woods around Concord, Massachusetts into a story of four persons fighting the fire - a priest, a farmer, a writer, and Thoreau. Their stories do intertwine nicely, characters appear early on to make the story work later, and the author does a good job of ending each characters \"story\". What I didn't appreciate was the sex; it gave what otherwise would've been a wonderful historical read a cheap feel. I am not usually bothered by sex scenes, but these seemed thrown in only to appease an audience of which i do not wish to be a part and did not seem to advance most of the story lines,Pumpkin sex? Really? Pipkin lost a star for that scene alone."}, {"userName": "No\u00eblibrarian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3614645-no-librarian", "userReview": "I wish I could give this book 6 stars, because it does so well the strange job of capturing that certain spirit that infuses much of my favorite American mid-19th century literature: A compelling mix of questing, Westward Expansion tempered by a sorrow for the loss of innocence of the New World, with an overlay of bizarre spiritual beliefs ranging from Puritanism to pantheism. I have a soft place in my heart for Henry David Thoreau, perhaps because he reminds me of the better angels of my own adolescent nature. I want to shake him and hug him at once. Yes, he did set fire to the woods. Yes, it was a stupid and tragic accident. But he did help stop the fire, and Pipkin imagines Thoreau taking such lessons from this episode as to have made Walden a direct beneficiary -- a piece of writing that might not have otherwise been possible."}, {"userName": "Allyson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2266545-allyson", "userReview": "Beautiful writing and an interesting presentation of Henry David Thoreau's possibly pivotal moment of his environmental theories & formulations.But there were 2 or 3 inclusions I found unnecessary and distracting- the pornographic book plates as well as the \"witches\" were oddly unnecessary. And Caleb was completely annoying. The jumping from character to character was instrumental in fast development of each person's history and actions, but seemed a facile way to achieve those ends. And given his writing skill, that ploy could have been abandoned and an elegant beautiful book could have been written. As it was, it seemed a lazier way to set it out.A beautiful grasp and delivery of the natural world. It left me wanting so much more from this writer, which seems unfair as I am not a writer, only a highly critical reader."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/219545-mike", "userReview": "Hugely disappointing. For anyone looking for insight into Thoreau's life and thought before he built his cabin near Walden Pond, you'll be disappointed too. All I learned really was a little bit about the manufacture of pencils. Thoreau accidentally sets the woods ablaze, and we learn about the lives of diverse individual whom the fire impacts. One character was a loner and had lived in isolation in the forest. One character is overwhelmed by a family and a mortgage. You get the idea. Of course, Thoreau interacts with these characters and so it is the reader beholds the genesis of the philosophy found in Walden. So contrived. So very contrived. So much so that I had to force myself to finish the book. One would think that a raging forest fire would generate more drama. Nope."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8530624-kristi", "userReview": "I had been waiting to read this novel for a few years, and my anticipation was disappointed. The plot, which was inspired by a real-historical incident, revolves around the loosely interconnecting stories of three fictional characters and Henry David Thoreau, following the historical fire that Thoreau accidentally set in the Concord woods. At times Pipkin's writing is beautifully evocative, but mostly I found the novel contrived and not compelling. Other than a brief passage of sympathy with \"Emma,\" I had a hard time connecting to the characters, or becoming invested in their narratives. Much of the book was bawdy or shallow, never breaking the surface into the depth of substance that was glimpsed in the strongest passages. The novel has much unrealized promise and purpose."}, {"userName": "Phair", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613975-phair", "userReview": "Not really what I expected and it took a while to get into it- maybe I was resisting having to read it to a schedule for discussion group. The f2f discussion was very lively and I think it left me with a better feeling for the book than the actual reading did. I did appreciate the way the author brought so many threads together into a complex tapestry where everyone connected somehow to everyone else and all contributed something to Thoreau's eventual \"philosophy\". I liked the character of Oddmund best and wouldn't mind knowing what happened to him and _____[blank left to avoid spoiler:] after the book's end.

On April 30, 1844, a year before he built his cabin on Walden Pond, Thoreau accidentally started a forest fire that destroyed three hundred acres of the Concord woods\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan event that altered the landscape of American thought in a single day. Against the background of Thoreau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fire, Pipkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious debut penetrates the mind of the young philosopher while also painting a panorama of the young nation at a formative moment. Pipkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Thoreau is a lost soul, plagued by indecision, resigned to a career designing pencils for his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s factory while dreaming of better things. On the day of the fire, his path will intersect with three very different local citizens, each of whom also harbors a secret dream. Oddmund Hus, a lovable Norwegian farmhand, pines for the wife of his brutal employer. Elliott Calvert, a prosperous bookseller, is also a hilariously inept aspiring playwright. And Caleb Dowdy preaches fire and brimstone to his congregation through an opium haze. Each of their lives, like Thoreau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, is changed forever by the fire.
