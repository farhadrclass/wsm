He knew that he would no more quail before his guides wherever they should point. He had been to touch the great death, and found that, after all, it was but the great death. He was a man.-\tStephen Crane, The Red Badge of CourageHere everything is planned for killing. The ground is ready to receive us, the bullets are ready to hit us, the spots where the shells will explode are fixed in time and space, just like the paths of our destiny which will inevitably lead us to them. And yet we want to stay alive and we use all our mental strength to silence the voice of reason. We are well aware that death does not immortalize a human being in the memories of the living, it simply cancels him out.-\tGabriel Chevallier, FearThis is a ferocious cry of pain and rage. Gabriel Chevallier\u2019s Fear is a semi-autobiographical novel that follows first-person narrator (and Chevallier stand-in) Jean Dartemont through the First World War. First published in 1930, it was pulled out of circulation during the Second World War, and only made its way to an English translation in the last few years. I'd never heard of it until a Goodreads friend brought it to my attention. I'm glad he did. This is a book that deserves a readership, because it has all the qualities of a classic. It is brutally violent, bleakly funny, unflinchingly honest, and courses with unbridled anger. It is one of the more unique, strange, and unsettling war novels I\u2019ve ever read. (The translation by Malcolm Imrie reads smooth. I can't speak for how well he goes from French to English, but I can vouch for the overall literary quality). Fear begins with an irresistible hook: a na\u00efve and innocent Europe on the brink of cataclysm. \u201cThe fire was already smoldering somewhere down in the depths of Europe,\u201d Dartemont says in the opening lines, \u201cbut carefree France donned its summer costumes, straw hats and flannel trousers, and packed its bags for the holidays.\u201d Suddenly, a war is on, and the iced absence has to wait. The nineteen year-old Dartemont, formerly a student, is now a soldier. In a scene of sly humor, he is chosen for officer candidacy, but subsequently scores too high on the proficiency test (only the men with the lowest scores become officers). Thus begins a hellish journey into the trenches, across No Man\u2019s Land, into a hospital, on a brief sojourn to the homefront, and back to the trenches again. The theme of the novel is stated in the starkness of the title: this is all about cold, naked fear. One thinks of Sherman at the Ohio State Fair in 1880, telling his listeners that war \u201cis all hell.\u201d Chevallier tries to make this observation real. He paints terrifying images with his words, creating an inferno that puts you in the mind of a Bosch painting. We were shaken out of this torpor by a world in flames. We had just marched over the crest of a hill, and suddenly there before us lay the front line, roaring with all its mouths of fire, blazing like some infernal factory where monstrous crucibles melted human flesh into bloody lava. We shuddered at the thought that we were nothing but more coal to be shoveled into this furnace, that there were soldiers down there fighting against the storm of steel, the red hurricane that burned the sky and shook the earth to its foundations. There were so many explosions that they merged into a constant roar and glare. It was as if someone had set a match to the petrol-soaked horizon, or an evil spirit was stoking up the flames in some devil\u2019s punch-bowl, dancing naked and sneering at our destruction.Chevallier meditates constantly on the terror felt by himself and the men around him. Those who are wounded but not permanently maimed feel as though they have won life\u2019s lottery. The utter randomness of their potential destruction maddens them. One desperate man activates a grenade, puts his arm around a dugout wall, and blows off his hand rather than continue. Chevallier also goes after the officers leading them to their destruction. He is persistent in his unrelentingly harsh critiques of the sheltered men who threw their lives away to gain an inch of mud they\u2019d lose in an hour. He goes so far as to write that the ordinary French soldier had more in common with a German soldier than with his own leaders. At times, Chevallier\u2019s Dartemont becomes a bit too didactic, especially with some of the speeches he gives while in the hospital. Dartemont\u2019s dialectics feel glaringly novelistic, in a book that is otherwise committed to gritty detail. On the whole, though, this fierce attack on the military leadership is rather bracing. We are entering a period \u2013 a hundred years later \u2013 of World War I revisionism. In my reading, I\u2019ve seen historians attempting to reframe and re-contextualize the generals who oversaw this great slaughter. Chevallier\u2019s perspective, and the perspective of others like him, provide an effective counterbalance. Yes, hindsight is clarifying; at the same time, it shouldn\u2019t wipe away the actual experiences of the people who lived it. Many war novels (and, for that matter, war movies) claim to be antiwar. Even so, it\u2019s really difficult to make this stance effectively. War brings out a lot of virtues in men and women: courage, loyalty, sacrifice. More to the point, the battlefield \u2013 to the reader or viewer, safe at home \u2013 can seem a kinetic and exciting place. An amphitheater of high-stakes action, pitting foes one against the other for the prize of victory, the prize of nations, the prize of life. Chevallier avoids this in a fascinating manner. His combat scenes \u2013 with one brief exception \u2013 never take Dartemont face to face with the enemy. The battles in Fear are absolutely impersonal, dominated by the shriek of artillery, by shrapnel slicing through the air. What Chevallier does is build tension without release. There is never an outlet. There is no cathartic moment when our protagonist finds his courage, lifts his rifles, and delivers an Alvin C. York impression. Instead, we are given the enduring portrait of a man suffering from diarrhea during a bombardment. We agonize with him as he decides whether to run for the latrines, or let his bowels explode in his pants. Mostly, when it comes to battles, Chevallier focuses on the grim aftermath. Dartemont is forever cataloguing the corpses that he stumbles across.From a distance I saw the profile of a bald little man with a beard, sitting on the fire-step, who seemed to be laughing. It was the first relaxed, cheerful face we had seen, and I approached him thankfully, asking myself what he had to laugh about. He was laughing at being dead! His head was cleanly sliced down the middle. As I passed, I saw with a start that he had lost half this jovial head, the other profile. The head was completely empty. His brains, which had dropped out in one piece, were placed neatly beside him\u2026This is the stuff of nightmares. As I read, I compared this to other war novels. Each war seems to give us a particular genre of novel. The fiction that came from Vietnam often centers on men who are fighting very hard for a cause they\u2019re unsure of, for a country that might not fully support them. Gulf War fiction often takes pains to compare the experience of the fighting men, waging war on a small patch of the globe, with that of their country, which \u201csupports\u201d them without having to sacrifice anything at all. Fear is a novel that comes from a different age, though its warnings are timeless. World War I was a massive war waged by huge conscript armies. Millions of men were wrenched from their lives to risk everything for nebulous geopolitical reasons. This is the source of Chevallier\u2019s wrath. The politicians always talk about the necessity of war. The generals about the glory of it. The civilians far from the front will sanctimoniously declare their own resolve. The soldiers, though, as Chevallier demonstrates, just want their one chance at life on earth."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "Fear:A Novel of World War I, The one novel you must read about the Great War\nGabriel Chevalier in service during World War IMuch more to come. Not to heighten suspense, this novel is superb. Chevallier holds nothing back in his depiction of war. It is a scathing portrait of indifferent leaders mindful of their reputation but not the fate of their men. Discipline is brutal. Armed Gendarmes on horseback are stationed behind the lines to send men moving to the rear back to the front. Gendarmes who do not fight have the authority to execute soldiers who do not obey. Medals are distributed, but to the commanders safely ensconced in fortified dugouts far in the rear of combat. Those at the front whose actions lead to success are not recognized. Newspapers cover up failures at the front. Civilians accustomed to seeing soldiers home on leave are unaware of the massive deaths at the front unless they have received personal notification of their own loss. This is a bold tale of bitterness and black humor. It is not to be missed. This may be THE WWI novel you've not heard of. It's tone is completely different from All Quiet on the Western Front and Grave's Goodbye to all That. Chevallier spares the reader nothing.

While this is a novel, it reads like fact and was written by a Frenchman who lived through these battles on the front. Perhaps fictionalized memoir is an apt description for this book. We begin with Jean Dartemont's rather lackadaisical approach to joining the French war effort and then his experiences as a recruit and at the front. Several times, as Jean's experiences progressed and he lived through some of the most harrowing moments of the war, I took a temporary break from reading after a particularly heartbreaking episode but then jumped back in. This is so well written, so full of details of daily life, the life of everyday French soldiers living in and digging trenches; waiting, constantly waiting, so often in the rain.The war begins.Priority! The telegraph is working flat out, for for reasons of state. Post offices send out telegrams in cipher, marked \"Urgent\". The proclamation is posted up on every town hall in the  country. The shouting starts: \"It's official!\" Crowds of people swarm on to the streets, pushing and  shoving, running, running in all direction. Cafes empty. Shops empty. Cinemas, museums, banks,  churches, bachelor flats and police stations empty. The whole of France now stands gazing at the poster and reads: \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity - General Mobilization.\" The whole of France stands on tiptoe to see the poster, all squeezed together in a fraternal huddle, dripping with sweat beneath a burning sun, and repeats the word  \"mobilization\" without understanding it. A voice goes off in the crowd like a firecracker: IT'S WAR! And then France goes into a spin, rushing along the  streets and boulevards that are too narrow for such crowds,  through the villages, and out across the countryside: war, war, war,... Hey! Over there! War! (loc 162)When you read this you will have the beginning of a feeling for Jean and his attitude toward the war. Both he and the author are skeptics. Both will do their duty no matter the cost.Men are stupid and ignorant. That is why they suffer. Instead of thinking, they believe all that they are told,  all that they are taught. They choose their lords and  masters without judging them, with a fatal taste for slavery. Men are sheep. This fact makes armies and wars possible. They die the victims of their own stupid docility.... They told the Germans: \" Forward to a bright and  joyous war! On to Paris! God is with us, for a greater Germany!\".... They told the French: \" The nation is under attack.  We will fight for Justice and Retribution. On to Berlin! .... So it was with the Austrians, the Belgians, the English, the Russian, the Turks, and then the Italians. In a single  week, twenty million men, busy with their lives and loves ....received the order to stop everything to go and kill other men....Twenty million, all in good faith, following god and their prince...twenty million idiots...like me!

Absurdity is there, along with the putrefaction. It doesn't take long for our semi-autobiographical, first-person narrator to understand that he is mere fodder, that there is no point. Yet, he is there for the duration, collecting stories and sharing the Fear. He is even capable of moments of courage.My views of War and of military ritual were formed long ago. What was new for me, here, was the graphic realization that you can not know unless you are there, feet in frozen water, ready to pointlessly climb the parapet. Convalescing from shrapnel wounds, Dartemont has this exchange with a friend of the family to whom he has spoken of Fear:'Still, you don't believe what you said, do you?''I really do believe it, as do many others.''But there is still such a thing as duty, they must have taught you that.''I've been taught a great many things - like you - and I'm aware that one has to choose between them. War is nothing but a monstrous absurdity and nothing good or great will come from it.''Dartemont, think of your country!''My country? Another concept to which you attach from a distance a rather vague ideal.' ...'But...what about liberty?''I carry my liberty with me. It is in my thoughts, in my head. Shakespeare is one of my countries, Goethe another. You can change the badge that I wear, but you can't change the way I think.'Back to the trenches, where Dartemont hears this:'There'll never be an end to this shit!' he grumbled.'Yes there will, old pal, it can't go on forever.''Oh jesus! ... If they stuck old Joffre here in my hole, and old Hindenburg opposite, with the lads on both sides cheering the bastards on, they'd soon sort out their bloody war!'_____ _____ _____ _____Chevallier, of course, was there. Nothing sounds made up. In fact, it didn't read like a novel at all to me. Like Dartemont, Chevalier was a conscript, wounded in the first year, and returned to fight till the ceasefire. He published 'Fear' in 1930 and it sold very well. Until 1939, when it was suppressed, with the acquiescence of the author. As he said, \"Once war has come, the time has passed for warning that it is a disastrous venture with unforeseeable consequences.

I've been trying to work my way through various WWI memoirs, there is a long list I'd like to get to, and I'd like to explore memoirs from various theaters and various cultures/nationalities (if you have any suggestions please let me know!). It's interesting getting the worm's eye view - almost literally when it comes to the nature of trench warfare! - of this episode of history.This book contrasts nicely with Ernst Junger's Storm of Steel. I think both are excellent, Junger's book is a must read imo and of exceptional quality, but ultimately I align much more with Gabriel Chevallier: his disgust at the elites, their wanton carelessness in sending hundreds of thousands of men to be slaughtered in offensives they knew to be doomed from the start, the class-issues and elitism involved with this war (which he hits upon throughout the book), the pernicious nationalism yoked onto the citizenry by the state (also buttressed by bottom up mob mentality nationalism which he captures in an early scene in the book), and horror at the modernized industrialized warfare. Junger was much more of a true believer in the war and nationalism, although I wouldn't call him brainwashed - he struck me as an exceptionally smart man - so in many ways I respect him but I don't think I would have connected with him. Chevallier is probably much closer to Erich Maria Remarque (need to reread his WWI book). They were disillusioned and disgusted by war and those in power leveraging the power of the state to coerce people to submit themselves to such a brutal enterprise (many soldiers were executed by their own governments for not wanting or being unable to fight anymore, or desertion). Junger, on the other hand, struck me as more enthralled by the whole thing. A telling statement by Chevallier was that he considered the German infantrymen on the other side to be of the same family as him, brothers in arms, while he considered the French officers and generals on his side to be the greater threat and true criminals in this whole enterprise. It's an interesting thought, and captures the anger towards the elites that many soldiers felt, a sentiment that transcended nationalities across the various fighting forces. How broad was this sentiment I don't know, but it was certainly there amongst a subset of soldiers.It's interesting to me how people can experience a relatively similar thing but process it in such different ways. What's nice in this book is that Chevallier captures the truth of his personal experience (as Junger captured his own personal truth of his experience), and both likely represent the truth of many other soldiers, marking different ends of a spectrum in how people experienced this thing, and I'm sure there was often a mix of feelings, and even certain paradoxical contrasting thoughts within the same individuals. Chevallier is a good guide, he has strong intellectual foundations (far as I can tell!), as did Junger, but comes at things from different angles. Both men strike me as very rational, at least they uphold a high respect for practicing logic and rational thinking with rigor and so in this respect they are very similar. Although it is interesting that WWI seemed to crush quite a few peoples' faith in Western rationalism and logic, showing the pernicious permutations of instrumental rationalism used to manipulate the public and showcasing the dark alleys that blind worship of positivism can lead to. In general, it seemed to erode faith in various large scale institutions, including government and church, but also the domains of science and technology. As far as I can remember, for Chevallier the main erosion happened in his view of government and church, but not as much in science and technology. Junger seemed relatively unscathed in his views towards institutions of his time. Science and technology probably faced fewer challenges and rebounded more strongly because they were able to deliver tangible results in improving quality of life for many people (electricity, sanitation, transportation, water, food, material wealth, medicine and longer life, etc etc)."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37797281-pat", "userReview": "\u00ab\u2026 se per avere un eroe bisogna massacrare diecimila uomini, preferisco fare a meno degli eroi.

This one is an unrecognized classic of the military novel genre that should be better known! Jean Dartemont, the eager young Frenchman, joins the French army in 1915 against the Germans. He is quickly disillusioned as to blind patriotism and to army life: there is no glory to be found here except that for the high officers, who grab it at the expense of the ranks. All to be found here in the trenches is only mind-numbing monotony and overwhelmingly, the desire to stay alive. Mostly the men are in a state of stasis waiting for the other side to start something. Fear, Anxiety, and Terror are Dartemont's constant companions, just as they accompany every other 'poilu' [common soldier]. We are taken through his whole military career from enlistment to the Armistice. It details Dartemont's coming upon dead Germans for the first time and his shock at how the bodies have been blown apart. In his first battle, in which he kills no one he is wounded enough to send to the hospital. Nurses there care for gruesome, grisly wounds and are disappointed there are no tales of glorious exploits. None of the patients have any to tell them. On convalescent leave, his father can't or won't understand the war from the common soldiers' viewpoint. Neither do civilians in general. Return to the front takes him either to the fighting or behind the lines as 'runner' [delivering messages under fire] or making and checking topographic maps and enemy positions, many times also under enemy bombardment. We were given an extended horrendous description of the Battle of Chemins de Dames. Letters home express what the home folks want to hear; they can't accept the soldiers' truths. As the war grinds wearily on, the despairing Dartemont writes:  \"No end seems in sight. Every day men fall. Every day we have less trust in our own luck....[Some] old hands who have been there from the start believe themselves immune, invulnerable, but most believe any luck will turn....Here everything is planned for killing...and yet we want to stay alive....the horror of war resides in growing anxiety: continuation, repetition of danger.\" Death can be seemingly random. This book is just as valid today as it was when it was written [1930]. I thought of Dartemont as an Everyman figure, a little man caught in brutality over which he had no control. The author pulled no punches in description; everyday events and fighting were not prettified, down to telling us about the soldiers' lice-ridden clothes and bodies. Dartemont's story and the emotions he and other soldiers feel and express so forcefully could be those of any soldier in any war; this novel just happens to be set in World War I. It is a powerful, savage anti-war, novel/memoir. It excoriates the brutal, rigid military system in toto and its hidebound officer hierarchy. Common soldiers give voice to their concerns. Even some few Germans chime in, with the same sentiments. Awarded the Croix de Guerre and made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur, Chevallier drew on some of his own experiences; I'm sure that's why the insights and the 'action' were so unforgettable and so vivid. Some of the scenes were absolutely chilling and made my blood run cold."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/775366-jim", "userReview": "Written by a French veteran of the First World War, FEAR is one of the great anti-war novels. Not as melodramatic as JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN nor even ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (and I use \"melodramatic\" only in a comparative sense), nor as absurdly comic as CATCH-22, Gabriel Chevallier's novel is simply (at least on the surface) a seemingly objective description of the life of a French poilu, or foot-soldier, in the trenches of northern France from 1914 to 1918. Chevallier recoils not one bit from the horrors so numbingly omnipresent on the battlefields of that wretched war, but he writes with an apparent detachment that obliterates the sense of this as a polemic. Yet the book is even more effective for Chevallier's seeming disdain for pushing an agenda, and beneath the surface lies a hidden lake of bile, sarcasm, and outrage. FEAR is an obscure book compared to the classic anti-war novels mentioned above, and has only recently been rediscovered and reissued. It is perhaps the most poetic novel of its type ever written.

The works I've been reading don't include that aspect, thankfully.I also read recently Under Fire, which covers a lot of the same ground thematically, if not literally, as this one. This is much better written - or I read a much better translation. This one covers the war from declaration to armistice, where the Barbusse ends in 1916.

He was able to give a broader picture of the war. He witnessed death and killing - a lot of it. He speaks to the futility of this war, especially that most of the generals/colonels giving battle orders seemed either unfamiliar with the uses and effects of the new technology, or simply didn't care. Machine guns had not been used in war before this one. Some of the other larger guns were also new to warfare. The orders were to just \"go over the top\" and run head on into the barrage of these weapons. When you weren't in the first group to go over, you tripped over corpses, or had to run by wounded men screaming in pain. When I think of it, it's just short of amazing that anyone came home alive.I want to repeat that this is ever so much better than Under Fire.

It starts in the carnival atmosphere of a France celebrating the beginning of a war. An old man who is slightly reticent in his patriotism and jingoism is promptly beaten up. Though Dartremont is an \"Outsider\" and resists any conventional thought, his curiosity and sense of adventure lead him to sign up. And why not, how bad could it be and how long could it go?

And then off to the front where shit really hits the fan in his first assault and he is promptly filled with shrapnel and sent back to recuperate, much to the jealousy of all his companions (poilus) who quickly undertand the awfulness and danger of war. There are more terrifying battles scenes, winters in the mountains, evil officers risking the lives of soldiers they don't like while never getting close to the front, injuries and explosions and deaths and hardships. But this book is much more than a description of a terrible time and place (though it is that and I haven't done it justice here). It is also an exploration of fear, of the motivations that make men do things they know are stupid and useless and will probably cause their deaths. It is hard to understand and the reader gets the sense Chevallier is trying to figure it out for the whole book. It is also a vicious indictment of the leaders\u2014both militarily and politically\u2014and the whole mindset of a Europe that had no idea what a modernization in this sense was going to be like. In this centenary of the First World War this is a book that should be read, and thought about in light of today, when the leaders are probably no smarter and the national consciousness just as prone to sacrifice innocent victims for no cause."}, {"userName": "Lobstergirl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl", "userReview": "This is Chevallier's fictionalized experience in World War I.

The generals, the commanders, the war planners, and officers, have their heads far up their butts; if they themselves were actually in combat, the war would get resolved exceedingly rapidly.I would not choose to read three (or even two) war novels back to back, but if that's up your alley, you could read this as part of a trilogy with All Quiet on the Western Front and The Stalin Front: A Novel of World War II."}, {"userName": "Steve Petherbridge", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3852894-steve-petherbridge", "userReview": "Of all the books that I have read that have graphically described the Western Front of World War I, including the now iconic \"All Quiet On The Western Front\", this is, perhaps, the best and most descriptively informative. This is probably due to the great translation and the readability and accessibility of the modern prose used. \"Fear\" is a testimony of not only the author's service and experiences, but, also delves into the class divisions in society of the time that dictated who directed the war and who decided on who actually took up arms and, most of the time, made the ultimate sacrifice, in many cases a sacrifice long forgotten.The upper classes won out on all fronts, until 1918 at least, but, as history now tells us, the men who returned from the war effectively overturned the class ridden societies of Europe, ensuring that the gentrified and those in the \"big houses\" never again decided their fates in favour of protecting their own lives, wealth and lifestyles. This graphically described tale, yet memorable novel, is one of a number of savagely frank novel-memoirs of the misnamed Great War that appeared throughout Western Europe within a year of one another. Frederic Manning\u2019s \u201cThe Middle Parts of Fortune\u201d shook English readers in 1929. In the same year, Erich Maria Remarque\u2019s \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d seemed treasonous to the fascists of Germany. \u201cFear\u201d created shock and resistance when it was published in France in 1930. This historic record simply laid bare the truth and the horrors of war.In many respects, it is written in anger and with some satire directed at the French army\u2019s war mongers and at their disregard for their men, treating them as cannon fodder and pawns in their version and strategy of the War. Much of what Chevallier wrote, because of the clarity and simplicity with which he wrote, strikes a heart pervading chord with the reader, and I believe should be accepted as a definitive eye-witness reportage on World War I. France had 1.3 million war dead, most of their parents or widows of dead soldiers left to live through what remained of their lives without their loved ones. Attaining a perspective around this is difficult. 1.3 million families affected! This review will not detail the upsetting descriptions of the corpses, the injured and the emotionally damaged that litter most pages of this book. Yes, good triumphs over evil, good people triumph over bad people. This is the general result that history tends to tell us. But, these triumphs come with a price. And, who are the good people and who are the bad people? Both sides are comprised of both. Is a German shopkeeper more evil than a French shopkeeper in the opposing trench? And, the old maxim always holds: the victor writes the history. \u201cFear\u201d, when published was a controversial challenge to civic and official memory of the war. To quote: \u201cIn 1939,\u201d Chevallier wrote in his preface to a 1951 edition, \u201cits author and publisher agreed to suspend sales. Once war has come, the time has passed for warning that it is a disastrous venture.\u201dChevallier, like Remarque and other eminent writers of the record of WWI, captures the great national fervour and propaganda in the nations of Europe that drove the mobilisation of this lost generation, the innocence and naivety of recruits, the deadening geography of the trench system of the Western Front, the decency of some NCOs and other officers, the emotional detachment of some Generals orchestrating men's actual lives often a distance away from the battlefields and sometimes with a casualness and even a whimsey, the sacrificial madness and the chaos of campaign plans; the inevitable physical and mental disabling (in our hero Dartemont\u2019s case, from grenade fragments) of survivors, the hospital wards of the field hospitals, the prized glimmers of sensuality and empathy from some nurses, the mercy and compassion of an old flame who saves a soldier\u2019s home leave from nullity, and the dreaded return as a veteran to the trenches, to being \u201csuspended between luck and death\".The reader has a tendency to think, \u201cI\u2019ve read all this before,\u201d but, this very consistency and descriptive repetitiveness across many books strengthens the truthfulness of these writers' descriptions of this terrible War. To quote from one review I read: \"Chevallier\u2019s narrative remains radioactive with pure terror, frightening in a way later accounts don\u2019t quite manage.....His tone is so inveigling and so amiable as he inducts us like witnesses into that great European madness with which the past century began, decades before most who will read this translation were born. It\u2019s also hard to believe, once we\u2019re deeply engaged with the book, that Chevallier is dealing with events that are nearly a hundred years in the past, deploying prose that\u2019s almost as old. We are lucky his voice came through.\"I feel lucky that I have read this book. Privileged. Lives sacrificed. Lives forgotten. Names forgotten. Tragic. Family lives of those relatives and friends left behind were lived under a shadow for most of the 20th Century as a result. A must-read for anyone interested in World War I and what the day-to-day war of the soldier was like, not that non-combatants can ever truly understand the horrors and terrors witnessed by the combatants. A great book. An education."}, {"userName": "Mike Clinton", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4749257-mike-clinton", "userReview": "I found this roman \u00e0 clef of the First World War from a novelist-participant on the French side more gripping and psychologically engaging in some parts than All Quiet on the Western Front. Having read extensively already about the French experience in la Grande Guerre, I may be biased; still, there doesn't have to be a rivalry for which one is the better, since they each have their memorable moments and rewarding insights about soldiers at war - war in general as well as this particular war.I actually read the French-language Livre de Poche edition and the NYRB Classics edition at the same time, just for the fun of experiencing another's translation with my own still fresh in my mind. In some instances, I found the translator Malcolm Imrie's rendering even more powerful than the original French, so I have a good sense for why he received the Moncrieff Prize for the translation. The vivid language and imagery describing the front - especially the main character Jean Dartemont's first impression of it - is striking. So, too, is the chapter - somewhat de rigeur in WWI novels - when Dartemont returns home and offers reflections about the distance between himself and his father more nuanced than the corresponding episode that Remarque presents. Interior reflections and insights, such as his observation about the difference in his attachment to comrades he happened to know before the war compared with those met during it, are also striking.Sometimes Dartemont's character seems inconsistently drawn. In one episode he's spouting like a grizzled Bolshevik to a clutch of nurses about patriotism, bravery, and heroism as insidious illusions that perpetuate the murderous exploitation of the common soldier; in another he's a more naive interlocutor asking questions in an almost catechism style of a Falstaffian character named N\u00e8gre, who pops up now and then. There are a few outright misogynistic comments in the first half of the novel, too, that can't really be explained away or contextualized as of the time (it was published in 1930) or expressing the brutality that war engenders in soldiers' attitudes."}, {"userName": "James Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy", "userReview": "Fear is an antiwar novel. Given the date of its publication I think it must have been one of the first of the Great War antiwar novels. A reviewer of this recent New York Review edition and translation commented that we've read similar treatises before. And perhaps we have, but it still seems fresh. Part of it is certainly because it's so well written, and part of it may be that there aren't that many novels of the war from the French perspective available in English. My own judgment is that it is among the finest of the novels to come out of the war.As the title indicates, the novel is about the fear of men in combat. It's about men who almost expect to die and who accept the fact of it and the horrible deaths of those around them. It's about overcoming that fear, too, as the protagonist Jean Dartemont does. His own willingness to bravely face death are triumphant moments in the novel. So it's about fatalism, too. as are all very good war novels. There is no \"Vive la France\" or thoughts of the greater good in a political context. The tone is without patriotism. These are soldiers whose thoughts are on their own survival, not France's. Dartemont says near the middle of his career as a soldier at the front, \"I can assure you that none of the men I saw fall around me died thinking of his country, with 'the satisfaction of having done his duty.' I don't believe that many people went off to fight in this war with the idea of sacrifice in their heads, as real patriots should have done.\" This is gritty and realistic and brims with truth. Though thirty years ahead of Joseph Heller's great creation John Yossarian, Chevallier's Jean Dartemont is cut from the same cloth.

I've read a lot of the English WWI autobiographies (although this is technically a fiction, it's obviously informed by Chevallier's own experience in the trenches), Goodbye to All That, etc., and I have to say this blows it out of the water. As the title indicates, Chevallier seeks to strip bare the pointless horror of mechanized warfare, and to redefine the doughy infantrymen as one who, with the rarest exceptions, is defined largely if not exclusively by a desperate, all consuming, immediate physical terror. If you've ever wondered about what you would look like if you were forced to grab a rifle and hold a trench at the Somme, pick this one up and feel bad about yourself.

What the reader will not find in Chevallier is any notion of glory and honor. In fact, at leave early on in the novel, his narrator, Jean Dartemont, is alienated even by the gauzy patriotism of his home town. The war itself is frequently hellish, but not without touches of wit, especially from Dartemont's friend, Negre, who imitates a nitwit general of his own invention who seems like a cross between Orwell and Heller. This is a work of controlled anger but also of intense humanity, with sharp portraits of not just Dartemont's fellow infantrymen, those who die and those who survive, including the occasional German, surrendering to the French or even working out codes of mutual warning with them. But there is no heroism here except that of having the luck to survive.

The nurses seek tales of war, glory and valiant duty\u2013after all, Jean must have had a number of stories that prefaced his horrible wounds and successful evacuation. But instead Jean, who was a student prior to entering the war in 1915, tries to convey the realities of war to an audience who simply do not understand. Jean\u2019s fervent arguments disturb the universe of the nurses\u2013mostly delicate young women from the best of French society, who\u2019ve volunteered to do their duty for the war effort. Jean notes that \u201ctheir heads are stuffed with good intentions, which have been garnished with the bric-a-brac of noble sentiments tied up in a pretty bow.\u201d He admits that during the war his \u201cchief occupation\u201d was fear, and the nurses react as though he said \u201csomething obscene.\u201d For this \u201cdemoralizing talk\u201d the chaplain is sent to lecture Jean, but goes away from the encounter dissatisfied.After this brief respite in hospital, Jean is sent back to the front where he is in involved in some of the most horrendous, notable battles of the war. The novel is written in retrospect, the war is over, and Jean has spent a great deal of time trying to understand this period of madness:Men are sheep. This fact makes armies and wars possible. They die the victims of their own stupid docility.When you have seen war as I have just seen it, you ask yourself\u201d \u2018how can we put up with such a thing? What frontier traced on a map, what national honour could possibly justify it? How can what is nothing but banditry be dressed up as an ideal, and allowed to happen?\u2019They told the Germans: \u2018forward to a bright and joyous war! On to Paris! God is with us, for a greater Germany!\u2019 And the good, peaceful Germans, who take everything seriously, set forth to conquer, transforming themselves into savage beasts.They told the French: \u2018The nation is under attack. We will fight for Justice and retribution. On to Berlin!\u2019 And the pacifist French who take nothing at all seriously, interrupted their modest little rentier reveries to go and fight.So it was with the Austrians, the Belgians, the English, the Russians, the Turks, and then the Italians. In a single week, twenty million men, busy with their lives and loves, with making money and planning a future, received the order to stop everything and go and kill other men. And those twenty million individuals obeyed the order because they had been convinced that this was their duty.Jean admits that\u201dThrough my own behaviour I can explain that of a great many others, especially in France.\u201dThey set off without any hatred at all, drawn by an adventure from which everything could be expected. The weather was lovely. This war was breaking out right at the beginning of August. Ordinary workers were the most eager: instead of their fortnight\u2019s annual holiday, they were going to get several months, visiting new places, and all at the expense of the Germans. A great medley of clothes, customs and classes, a great clamour, a great cocktail of drinks, a new force given to individual initiatives, a need to smash things up, leap over fences, to break laws\u2013all this, at the start, made the war acceptable. It was confused with freedom, and discipline was then accepted in the belief that it was lacking.Everywhere had the atmosphere of a funfair, a riot, a disaster and a triumph; a vast intoxicating upheaval. The daily round had come to a halt. Men stopped being factory workers or civil servants, clerks or common labourers, in order to become explorers and conquerors. Or so at least they believed. They dreamed of the North, as if it were America, or the pampas, or a virgin forest, of Germany as if it were a banquet; they dreamed of laying waste to the countryside, breaking open wine barrels, burning towns, the white stomachs of the blonde women of Germania, of pillage and plunder, of all that life normally denied them. Each individual believed in his destiny, no one thought of death, except the death of others. In short, the war got off to a pretty good start, with the help of chaos.That\u2019s a fairly long quote, one of my favourites from this highly quotable and much highlighted book. The quote gives a strong sense of the author\u2019s style but also it\u2019s a good example of the novel\u2019s tone. The author through his observant narrator always keeps a sense of distance from his subject matter, and really that\u2019s just as well. Who doesn\u2019t cringe at just the thought of the squelch of mud-filled trenches, the \u201cwasteland full of corpses,\u201d and the stench of rancid, rotting human flesh found in a WWI novel? But while the narrator may be in the thick of things, there\u2019s always a sense of distance and also of anger. Anger at the carnage, anger at the incompetence, and anger at those who \u2018manage\u2019 the war from a safe distance. Anti-war literature is by its nature, radical, subversive, but Fear, in its unsentimental detachment, doesn\u2019t take the usual position of loss and waste, and instead emphasizes anger at the insanity of events which foments until Jean explodes with his opinions\u2013no matter the consequences. At one point Jean notes \u201cthose who wanted all this\u201d make public appearances on \u201cpalace balconies,\u201d and for Jean, this was the moment when \u201cthe first\u2013and last\u2013machine gun should have done its work. emptied its belt of bullets on to that emperor and his advisors.\u201d He notes,\u201cin the revolution, they sent incompetent generals to the guillotine, an excellent measure.\u201dFear is a unique entry into the canon of WWI fiction, for even though the story follows the normal trajectory of WWI novels, a young man enlisting into a carnage that is impossible to even imagine, its unsentimental approach makes the novel unique. We are there with Jean when he sees his first corpse, picks off the first lice, watches the first killings, learns to keep his head down, hears dying soldiers begging to not be abandoned, grasps at jobs that will temporarily remove him from danger, cowers in a cave hoping he won\u2019t be buried alive, and as he insanely volunteers to take another man\u2019s place for a dangerous mission. The sense of chaos surrounding Jean is underscored by the ridiculous, senseless demands made by the officers, and also by the way we never discover the fate of some of the few named characters who cross Jean\u2019s path. What happens to these soldiers as they lay trampled in the mud, or, if they\u2019re lucky, are carried off the field to one of evacuation sites where they may, if their wounds are too severe, be left to rot and die as the overworked doctors save those who are considered salvageable? While Fear covers some familiar territory here: the incompetence of generals, the type of men who excel at wartime, the dehumanization of soldiers, and the collaboration of society\u2019s vested interests (the church, the state, the police, and the bourgeois), Gabriel Chevallier\u2019s unsentimental approach in a situation that is driven by Jean\u2019s anger, the strong narrative voice, and the manner in which the author excels at description, secure this novel\u2019s place in the must-read list of WWI novels.Author Gabriel Chevallier fought in WWI. The introduction written by John Berger mentions that Fear was published in 1930, and as an \u201canti-war book had the misfortune to run into a new one. In 1939, its author and publisher freely agreed to suspend sales.\u201d Perhaps this is why the book faded from view.Review copy.

I'm on a mission to understand more about World War 1, and this was yet another work of art. Gabriel Chevallier was a talented writer, as others have stated he writes well, depicting WW1 in a way to chich I've not been exposed. A semi-autobiographical account based on Chevallier's own experiences, this memior, disguised as fiction, rings true. The trenches, the decomposing bodies, the rats. Also kudos to the translator for an entirely readable effort.There are some impressive quotes that have stayed with me that could apply to today:Page 109, Dartemont holds forth:\"My country? Another concept to which you attache from a distance a rather vague ideal. You want to know what 'my country' really is? Nothing more or less than a gathering of shareholders, a form of property, bourgeois mentality, and vanity. Think about all the people in your country whom you wouldn't go near, and you'll see that the ties that are supposed to bind us all together don't go very deep...I can assure you that none of the men I saw fall around me died thinking of his country, with the satisfaction of having done his duty.\" I don't believe that many people went off to fight in this war with the idea of sacrifice in their heads, as real patriots should have done.\"And page 110:\"That word fear shocked you, didn't it? It's not a word you'll find in the histories of France, and that won't change. But I'm sure now that it will have its place in our history, as in all others. In my case, I reckon convictions will overcome fear, rather than fear overcoming convictions. I think I'd die quite well for something I believed in passionately. But fear isn't something to be ashamed of: it is a natural revulsion of the body to something for which it wasn't made. Not many people avoid it. Soldiers know what they're talking about because they've managed to hide it from those around them who were feeling it too. I knew men who believed I was brave by nature, because I had hidden what I was going through. For even when our bodies are wriggling in the mud like slugs and our mind is screaming in distress, we still sometimes want to put on a show of bravery, by some incomprehensible contradiction. What has made us so exhausted is precisely that struggle between mental discipline and flesh in revolt, the exposed, whimpering flesh that we have to beat into submission so we can get up again ...conscious courage, mademoiselle, starts with fear.\"The ultimate anti-war novel, I can see why the author and publisher decided to cease printing in 1939.

The display focuses rightly on the human side of the attack, highlighting personal stories, diary entries and seemingly hundreds of photos of young men and women. The honour and bravery of these individuals shines through in comments like Lieutenant Owen Steele\u2019s 23 June 1916 diary entry, Everyone seems so cool about it all, quietly preparing for what is going to be the greatest attack in the history of the world, and very possibly the greatest there will ever be. We only hope that it may be a very strong factor in bringing an early end to the war. The courage and confidence expressed through correspondences like Private Francis Lind\u2019s letter to the Daily News on 29 June 1916, two days before the attack, is abundantly evident,No pen could describe what it is like, how calmly one stands and faces death, jokes and laughs; everything is just an every day occurrence. You are mud covered, dry and caked, perhaps, but you look at the chap next you and laugh at the state he is in; then you look down at your own clothes and then the other fellow laughs. Then a whizz bang comes across and misses both of you, and both laugh together. This bravado is what the wartime non-combative public needed to hear from their soldiers. They needed to be reminded that their sons were excited to be fighting for Britain and were embracing the danger. Their men possessed a truly unique measure of courage and bravery, traits which would define not just their families, but their dominion as a whole. And indeed the attack at Beaumont Hamel remains a defining moment for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador who watched their regiment earn a Royal distinction for their bravery. To a civilian visitor viewing this display 100 years after the fact, a natural self-reflection takes place where one wonders, \u201cwould I have been able to face these circumstances with similar gallantry?\u201d The answer must surely be a resounding, \u201cno!\u201d And then one comes across Gabriel Chevallier\u2019s Fear:We were shaken out of this torpor by a world in flames. We had just marched over the crest of a hill, and suddenly there before us lay the front line, roaring with all its mouths of fire, blazing like some infernal factory where monstrous crucibles melted human flesh into a bloody lava. We shuddered at the thought that we were nothing but more coal to be shovelled into this furnace, that there were soldiers down there fighting against the storm of steel, the red hurricane that burned the sky and shook the earth to its foundations.Chevallier makes a compelling argument for war, and trench warfare in particular, as representative of hell on earth. He depicts soldiers on both sides of the war as ordinary young men who are as terrified of death as any modern reader would be in the same situation. He places the blame squarely on the shoulders of political leaders more interested in power and reputation than the lives of the young men who don\u2019t even fully understand what they are fighting for, leading with a quote from Pascal\u2019s Pens\u00e9es, \u201cCan anything be more ridiculous than that a man should have the right to kill me because he lives on the other side of the sea, and because his ruler has a quarrel with mine, though I have none with him\u201d. He offers scathing criticisms of military leadership, men who in most cases demand heroism under impossible circumstances, all while sitting safely back from the front line. Should their troops somehow succeed, these leaders are the ones who profit. Should they fail, there is a seemingly limitless supply of men, anonymous in their uniformity, to take their place. War as \u201cedifying, purifying, redemptive\u201d adventure, filled with willing and eager participants sacrificing their lives out of unquestioning patriotism and a complete belief in the inherent moral righteousness of their cause is an ideal completely shattered here. So much so that Chevallier and the publisher stopped publishing the work in 1939, ahead of the Second World War, explaining in his introduction to the 1951 edition, \u201conce war has come, the time has passed for warning that it is a disastrous venture with unforeseeable consequences\u201d. At least to this reader, this raised the question of how much of an uphill battle the military propaganda machine has now in a world of social media. There can be far fewer illusions about the realities of war in the twenty first century.A wonderfully thought-provoking, soul-crushing work, Fear stands in contrast to the sterilized version of military heroism on display in St. John\u2019s, but by no means diminishes the sacrifice. In fact, it makes those men seem far more relatable and their true stories far more tragic. Through all the fear and resentment, all the pain and suffering, Chevallier gives us a glimmer of humanity to grasp onto,Now that I\u2019m a soldier of the trenches once more, I can understand the kind of fatalism to which my comrades succumb, in this war where nothing ever happens, nothing changes, everything looks the same; a war where all we do is keep watch and dig ditches, suffer silently in the muck and mud; a war without limit or respite, where we don\u2019t do anything, don\u2019t even defend ourselves, just wait for the chance shell that has our name on it. I can understand what these two long years, the hundreds of nights on sentry duty, the thousands of endless hours looking out into the dark, what they represent for those who\u2019ve endured them. I can understand that they have stopped asking themselves questions. And yet it still amazes me that this herd of cattle, of which I have become a part, still struggles so much against death.Even under the worst imaginable conditions, the human spirit must still strive to live."}, {"userName": "Irene Mendoza", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76805019-irene-mendoza", "userReview": "Con este libro he tenido una relaci\u00f3n de aceptaci\u00f3n-no aceptaci\u00f3n. El texto tiene varios temas que est\u00e1n presentes a lo largo del libro: el miedo es algo continuo al estar en el frente durante casi la totalidad de la I Guerra Mundial, pero tambi\u00e9n es especialmente relevante el conflicto generacional entre padres-hijos o incluso entre gente de la misma generaci\u00f3n la confrontaci\u00f3n de ideas que tienen. Por mi parte, el momento de no aceptaci\u00f3n del libro son las descripciones que hace muy cruentas de algunos hechos y, c\u00f3mo no, las descripciones que hace de las escasas mujeres que aparecen en el libro (principalmente, enfermeras). Directamente estas descripciones las pas\u00e9 tras haber le\u00eddo un par y observar que solo las trata como objetos. De todas formas, ponerse en la piel de un soldado de la IGM durante la totalidad del conflicto, es algo que llega a transmitir, esa emoci\u00f3n continua de miedo, que casi se convierte en sentimiento en ineludible."}], "description": "An NYRB Classics Original Winner of the Scott Moncrieff Prize for Translation1915: Jean Dartemont heads off to the Great War, an eager conscript. The only thing he fears is missing the action. Soon, however, the vaunted \u201cwar to end all wars\u201d seems like a war that will never end: whether mired in the trenches or going over the top, Jean finds himself caught in the midst of an unimaginable, unceasing slaughter. After he is wounded, he returns from the front to discover a world where no one knows or wants to know any of this. Both the public and the authorities go on talking about heroes\u2014and sending more men to their graves. But Jean refuses to keep silent. He will speak the forbidden word.
