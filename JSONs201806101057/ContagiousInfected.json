This guy had an ok idea and decided to write a novel about it. I'll give him kudos for the work but I really can't say he's a great author. The characters are flat, reach life-altering decisions in a heartbeat, change their behaviour and opinions on a whim. Maybe it's just me but I hated every chapter title in this book because it couldnt be drier - like a weather forecast: \"Margaret Has a Coffee\" kind of stuff which sounded more like college textbook chapters than actual sci-fi novel titles. The guy who cries his eyes out in one paragraph sucks it up and becomes a hero in the next. The woman who says no sir, never ever decides it's actually a yes on the next page...it felt so haphazard, so thrown together, so clumsy. Dont even get me started on the science part of it. Overall, it was like watching a Jason Statham action movie: a thrilling, exaggerated, cliche, totally unrealistic and basically shallow entertainment. Sorry for being harsh but as an avid sci-fi and thriller reader I must say that yes, the Story is important but the best story is nothing if you can't spin it well enough to make it memorable. The ending of course indicated that the series will continue. Not sure if I'll read the third installment."}, {"userName": "\u273f\u210eaz\u212f\u2113 - th\u212f \u211bock C\u210eick \u2131airy\u273f", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4162653-az---th-ock-c-ick-airy", "userReview": "THE ACTION.

There aren't any scenes quite as memorable as the one involving the chicken scissors from the first book, but the story is still a good one. Seeing how the military is working to stop the triangles and the impact that is having on Dawsey is good. Of course, this being a novel by Sigler, those who are a bit squeamish need not apply.

Es folgt eine Besprechung zu einem Buch, das den zweiten Teil einer Reihe darstellt. Spoiler zu Band 1 \u201cInfiziert\u201d sind daher durchaus m\u00f6glich und jedwedes Weiterlesen erfolgt auf eigene Gefahr.Nachdem wir im ersten Teil Perry Dawseys wahnswitzigen, brutalen und heftigen \u00dcberlebenskampf gegen die blauen Dreiecke miterlebt haben spinnt Sigler die Story um eine ungew\u00f6hnliche Au\u00dferirdischeninvasion weiter.Immer noch befindet sich die Schaltzentrale der Invasoren im Orbit unseres Planeten und hat aus der Niederlage gegen Dawsey gelernt. Modifizierte Sporen werden auf die Menschheit losgelassen und sollen diesmal verhindern, dass die Menschen das Tor finden und zerst\u00f6ren k\u00f6nnen, bevor es aktiviert wurde und ihre Armee ausspucken konnte. Wieder tauchen infizierte Menschen auf, die durchdrehen und ihre Liebsten und sich selbst bestialisch zerst\u00f6ren, doch im Gro\u00dfen und Ganzes l\u00e4uft alles koordinierter ab.Nachdem Margaret Montoya Dawsey wieder zusammengeflickt hat und er sich einigerma\u00dfen erholen konnte stellt man fest, dass seine Verbindung zu anderen Infizierten nicht vollkommen gekappt wurde. Perry hetzt durch das Land und erl\u00f6st einen Infizierten nach dem anderen von seinem Leiden, da ihm niemand stark genug erscheint, um es mit den Dreiecken aufzunehmen. Dew Phillips versucht zusammen mit seinem kleinen Team Dawseys Antennen zu nutzen, aber ihn gleichzeitig daran zu hindern die infizierten Menschen abzuschlachten. Zudem braucht Montoya unbedingt einen lebenden Infizierten, um den Vorg\u00e4ngen weiter auf die Spur zu kommen und zu verstehen, was genau bei einer Infektion passiert.Dann \u00e4ndert der Orbiter etwas in seinen Sporen und erschafft damit ein neues Grauen, dem alle Gegner machtlos gegen\u00fcberstehen. Im Mittelpunkt des Ganzen steht ein Engel mit goldenen Locken und dem Namen Chelsea.Diesmal erz\u00e4hlt Sigler keine One-Man- bzw. One-Perry-Show und eine Story von Montoya und Phillips daneben, wie sie machtlos der neuen Bedrohung gegen\u00fcberstehen. Der Gegner ist bekannt und es gilt nicht nur einzelne Menschen sondern Amerika zu retten. Die Bedrohung weitet sich aus, wird intelligenter und schlimmer und ein actiongeladenes, brutales Katz- und Mausspiel beginnt.Lag der Fokus in \u201cInfiziert\u201d noch deutlich auf Dawsey \u00dcberlebenskampf und dem Entdecken der Dreiecke, so besch\u00e4ftigt sich \u201cVirulent\u201d mit weiteren Themengebieten. Dawsey findet auch statt, findet seinen Raum und auch Erlebnisse aus dem Vorg\u00e4ngerband werden angeschnitten und thematisiert, jedoch liegt hier nicht mehr der Hauptaugenmerk. Die Geschichte wird relativ ausgeglichen aus der Sicht der k\u00e4mpfenden Menschen, aber auch aus der Sicht von Infizierten, vom Orbiter und von Chelsea erz\u00e4hlt.Wirklich meckern kann ich nicht, aber im Vergleich zum Vorg\u00e4nger muss ich sagen, dass das Buch in der Mitte einen leichten H\u00e4nger in Sachen Spannung hat und dort etwas braucht um wieder rasant zu werden.Sigler-Leser sollten Action m\u00f6gen, Wissenschaft, gute Recherche, SciFi, und Horror. Zudem sollte man bei manchen Szenen einen starken Magen besitzen. Ich w\u00e4re aber kein Fan dieses Autors, wenn er neben dem spannenden Actionged\u00f6ns nicht auch Platz f\u00fcr Charakterausbau lie\u00dfe und somit auch mit der Fortsetzung der Reihe einen genialen Roman geschaffen hat, den ich liebe und dessen Ende mich immer wieder verzweifeln l\u00e4sst."}, {"userName": "Tressa ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226335-tressa", "userReview": "Scott Sigler\u2019s Infected is such a demented joyride, I was doubtful that he could pull off an equally entertaining sequel. Why did I bother to doubt him? Sigler\u2019s got a cult following for a reason: He delivers. Contagious not only meets my expectations but exceeds them in a book filled with insidious aliens, bursting hosts, and a persistent crew scrambling to stop an airborne invasion.The same players are back for more punishment in Contagious: CIA veteran Dew Phillips; his boss, CIA director Murray Longworth; epidemiologist Margaret Montoya; and my new favorite literary character: the refrigerator-sized ex-linebacker \"Scary\" Perry Dawsey.It is six weeks later and the team finds itself in the unenviable position of having to stop an even more virulent strain of the virus\u2014a virus that is correcting the mistakes made during the first invasion of earth. Where the initial strain infected hosts with triangles that hatched from bodies, the new strain pairs the triangles with crawlers that go for the brain. Guiding the invasion is the Orbital, a satellite that releases the seeds, programs them, and communicates with the hosts.To make matters worse, a new president has just been elected. John Gutierrez has to hit the ground running after being briefed by Murray Longworth, making decisions he never thought he would have to make as POTUS. Will he logically subscribe to the adage that the needs of the many outweight the needs of the few?In Infected Perry Dawsey took center stage in the first invasion because he had the guts to rid himself of triangles by knife, fork, and fire; in Contagious it\u2019s a sweet-as-pie 7-year-old named Chelsea calling the shots as she communicates with \u201cgod\u201d\u2014the Orbital. As she gathers her army around her in Detroit, the infected and non-infected alike may face nuclear annihilation.Pandemic, the conclusion to the Infected series, will be published in the next few years.The deranged Scott Sigler has an awesome website filled with his trademark wit and wisdom on subjects ranging from Alf to Vikings, and populated with enthusiastic Sigler \"junkies.\" He offers free podcasts of his books, all parts read by Sigler. Between writing novels, podcasting, and managing his Web site, Sigler writes the weekly horror column Laughing in the Face of Death over at AMCTV.com.Currently I'm listening to Nocturnal on my iPod. It's a trip listening to Sigler segue seamlessly into Pookie the non-PC Chinese detective, a neglectful foster mother, a female police chief, a black homeless man, a fortune teller afflicted with Tourette's, Russian and Italian gangsters, a family of monsters, and a cast of many more."}, {"userName": "Sensitivemuse", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2434215-sensitivemuse", "userReview": "Wow. This novel was great! I liked how it provided more background information on the aliens and their hidden agenda towards Earth it gave the story more depth and the story is well rounded out. As in Infected, I also liked how there are scientific terms and theories, but it was easily explained and not complicated to understand. We all know some science fiction novels have a lot of technological jargon and you're left wondering if you're reading an encyclopedia on physics or rocket science. Here, everything is kept at Science 101 which is good, at least the reader is not stuck with having to go back to their college notes. I also liked the idea of the virus being able to evolve and to adapt so no matter how hard the government tries to fight it, it somehow gains the upper hand I thought it was an interesting way of keeping the story going.The use of Chelsea in the book is very well done. It makes the story more eerie and creepy by using a child - a very beautiful and innocent like girl to become one of the most horrible creatures I've ever read in my life. You also get to see Perry Dawsey evolve from a psychotic raging killer doing down the downward spiral to a more calculated one, but with good intentions thanks to Dew. There is a lot of action in this novel. It's so fast paced and well done it's almost as if you're watching a movie instead of reading. There are also a few military terms here and there but it shouldn't really bother the reader if they're not familiar with the terminology (same with the science terms). There is a lot of gore and swearing for those that aren't keen with that sort of thing. Other than that, this is a very pleasing sequel, is there room for more? well, I suppose it's up for the reader to decide. Personally, I wouldn't mind wondering what happens to the characters but then again perhaps it's better if it stays with two books instead. It could go either way I guess.Overall a wonderful, fast paced, sequel to Infected. A great read for sci fi action lovers anywhere. If the gore and swearing don't bother you pick up both books and read them straight through. You won't be dissapointed. Also, in this book is one of the most wonderful, awesome, feel-good \"tell-offs\" I have ever read in my life between Murray, President Gutierrez and Vanessa. I will never forget that part in the book.

Perry, Dew, Margaret... and a few new players.Although still quite gory and disturbing, this book didn't have that same WTF!? impact that Infected had on me. At least I could read it without having to look away at some parts. As usual, Scott's science in each of his books is mind boggling and detailed but not overwhelming. He has the perfect blend of science and action to give his stories a realistic and terrifying feel. This one was the same.I also really loved the relationship that develops between the two protagonists. I'm a little upset over the ending although I know it was the sensible way it should have gone.I look forward to reading the next book in this series, Pandemic. I hear that a character from Sigler's Ancestor joins in the fun which I'm looking forward to."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37569397-matt", "userReview": "I have come to a realization that Scott Sigler is one of the hardest working authors out there. I first heard about Mr. Sigler while listening to his interview on The Dragon Page podcast. They were discussing his book Infested and the \u2018radical\u2019 methods that he uses to get his work recognized, such as, releasing it as a free e-book and offering the free audio version. Soon after the podcast was finished a free copy of Infested appeared in my iTunes que. I am pretty sure the publisher did not know what to make of this but I glad they took a chance. I really admired the different approach Mr. Sigler was taking to promote his work so I went out that weekend and purchased a copy of the hardcover edition, at full price no less, even though I had a free copy on my hard drive.Now, all this promotion would not work if Mr. Sigler could not write. Luckily, he is a hell of writer and reminds me of a young Stephen King in that the further you get into the story the harder it is to put the book down. Infested ended up being one of my favorite novels of 2008. So I was eagerly awaiting the sequel, Contagious. It is not so much a sequel as it is a continuation.Contagious starts off right about where Infected left off. My two favorite characters are back, Perry Dawsey and CIA agent Dew Phillips along with all the people from the first novel. Perry is left affected by the events of Infected and his able to track the triangles and their constant attempts to build gates (portals). So Perry, the CIA and the military spend their time tracking down gates and taking them out before the alien invaders can come through. Unfortunately, the aliens are getting wise to the human tactics and shift their strategy. So instead of infecting humans, they work out a way for the triangles to become contagious so that it will be impossible for the puny humans to stop them. From here, all hell breaks loose.Contagious takes place on much grander scale than Infested did. The ending is shocking in it\u2019s brutality and will leave you stunned.What I liked: As I said, about half way through the book it is impossible to put down. It kinda reminded of the TV Show 24. Bad things keep happening to the good guys and you wonder how they are going to get out of it. The action continues to build a break neck speed and Mr. Sigler does not let up on throttle until the last page. By the time you turn the last page, you will your best Keanu Reeves\u2019 rendition of \u201cWoh\u201d.What I didn\u2019t like: The third book, Pandemic, is not ready to go and I have to wait.Last word: Scott Sigler is on the precipice of becoming a big time author and this is due in large part to the work he puts into his novels and into his \u2018radical\u2019 promotional methods. Even though it is early in 2009, I can confidently state that Contagious will be one of favorite books of the year.As a side note, Mr. Sigler also made into our family\u2019s lexicon. My wife and I use numerous saying that a few people understand. For example, when watching a movie and a character is suddenly introduced just so that they can be killed, we will laugh and point out that they are a \u201cRed Shirt\u201d (Google it if you don\u2019t get it). Anyway, after reading Contagious I now threatened my wife that she will get the \u201cSpanky-Spoon\u201d if she does not behave. So, congratulations Mr. Sigler, you have made into our family\u2019s weird sayings that nobody understands and gets us strange looks from friends and family."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/608797-christopher", "userReview": "Contagious picks up right where Infected left off, featuring most of the same characters and dealing with much the same basic issue: an alien species is attempting to create a portal from their world to ours, that they might invade. To do so, they need workers, and these workers grow from human bodies (turning the host paranoid and violent before finally killing them entirely during the 'birthing' process). The new twist introduced in the second book is that certain humans who've been infected with a new strain do not grow workers, but instead simply fall under the control of the entity that's been generating all of this chaos ... or, more accurately, first fall under its control and then under the control of a single human host who's grown too powerful for that entity to dominate.These new infected can spread the infection, either through a kiss (their tongues are the vector), or, as we later find out, through other means entirely. This makes things much more difficult for our protagonists, as it means the infection can travel far and fast, and to unexpected people, who are almost immediately overwhelmed by it.Contagious is, like Infected, a book filled with visceral violence and fast action. It improves on Infected in a number of ways, however, including improved characterization and dispensing with a certain idiomatic phrase that the first book drove into the ground. It also contains less vivid descriptions of bodily mutilation, which made it feel less like Night Shift-era Stephen King to me. Instead, Sigler ups the actual science to even greater levels, which I liked a lot.Overall, Contagious feels to me like a writer who's growing more comfortable in his own style. The ultra-short chapters and casual tone help make it a fast read (it took me a while to get through it only because I accidentally left it at home during a vacation), and I liked that none of the characters come through this one sparkling clean; everyone makes tough decisions and gets some dirt under their fingernails.Sigler is a little too into \"all guys be like this\" for me, at times, but I didn't find that it drew me away from the story much. I did have a hard time getting into things at first, as there weren't any characters I particularly liked, but what Sigler does with both Dew Phillips and Perry Dawsey worked for me, and in particular I found the ending satisfying and at least mildly touching. An unexpected but oddly pleasant (particularly given what happens in the book's final ten pages) way to wrap things up.I started out thinking this was a three-star book, then it grew on me, and the ending chapters really helped take it up to four."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4027088-stephanie", "userReview": "Part 2 of the Infected horror story is Contagious. It continues the story after the military has stopped the first wormhole from opening. They have now recruited Perry Dawsey because he can \"hear\" the communication between the hatchlings and something else to figure out where more of these gates are being built by these hatchlings. In this book, I enjoyed that it gave some back story into the how to of the blue triangles and hatchlings, etc. Basically, there is a very complex satellite, of sorts, that is creating these spores to infect people, but it's smart and can try other methods to be successful. So...since the infection of people with hatchlings isn't working out too well and Dawsey can \"hear\" them and figure out where the gates are being built, this satellite thing changes things up and decides to create soldiers to protect the hatchlings. In doing so, it creates a \"general\" out of a 6 year old girl to control all the hatchlings and soldiers. The satellite communicates with her convincing her the aliens are angels to be loved...until she becomes a bit too big for her britches and tells the satellite to take a flying leap. While I loved the flow of the novel, this was my one bone to pick. Maybe it's because I have a 6 year old myself, and he happens to not be a sociopath. I found Chelsea, the 6 year old sociopathic general of the \"army of apocalypse\" to be somewhat unbelievable. She had no concept of right or wrong. Now I could see how a 3 or 4 year old child could be like that, but a 6 year old? We're talking 1st graders. My 6 year old is probably too honest, but children his age know right and wrong and understand you don't torture people into submission. I just find it hard to believe this girl was turned into an alien soldier and suddenly lost all concepts of right and wrong. She still could crave ice cream and McDonalds, but beating her mother or killing a 9 year old were just fine and dandy.Other than this one issue, it's a great story. It switches back and forth between the satellite's plans, the FBI/CDC chasing the \"infection,\" and the Chelsea army of crazies. If you love sci fi and thrillers, this is a great series to read. It will scare the crap out of you.

I stumbled across a paperback that a co-worker promised was an example of Chuck tackling sci-fi. I opened it up and never looked back. The graphic nature of the novel was raw and organic. I felt Perry's pain every step of the way. You couldn't convince me not to read the second one. Don't get me wrong. Contagious is a great novel. I just wasn't sure at the time if it was the best followup to Infected. It was a sequel about an alien invasion, so it had to up the scale. That was never a question.

In fact, I stopped a few pages into the book to go make sure that I hadn't somehow skipped over the second book in a trilogy and gone right to number three. A lot happens in the short time between Infected and Contagious, and it's stuff that drives the plot of the sequel.

These Triangles then hatch into tentacle-borne pyramids that will build an interstellar gate to let the aliens cross the vast distance between Earth and wherever it is they live. They were stopped once before. Now their agents on Earth are trying again, and again, modifying tactics each time. And it's clear that the Triangles alone won't be enough\u2014they need protection in the form of contagious hosts, vectors for a new version of this infection. Contagious is a book in which your most outrageous nightmares have already come true and are about to get even worse.Much of what I said about Infected applies to Contagious. These books are so similar and work so well together that, once the final book in the trilogy is out, this series is ripe for an omnibus edition. I have no idea when the third book will be released. Fortunately, Contagious does not suffer the effects of \"middle book syndrome.\" Those who haven't read Infected will miss out on the enjoyable experience of reading the book, but Contagious quickly brings the reader up to speed on everything pertaining to the story. Also, it delivers a satisfying ending that ties off every major plot point save one, thus leaving an opening for the third book.Contagious has all of Infected's attitude but has improved on some of its flaws. That's not to say it's perfect. In fact, while I tolerated the narrator's tone in Infected, I found myself rolling my eyes quite a bit this time around. Sigler uses a limited omniscient narrator, which is great for giving each character a distinct voice. The only problem is that he gives every character the same voice. . . . Everyone sounds like a disrespectful, anti-authoritarian \"sonofabitch\" (to borrow the Triangles' name for Perry Dawsey) who's free with the expletives. The only exception to the rule is Chelsea, who starts off as a normal seven-year-old and eventually becomes the uber-leader of the aliens. Sigler's attempts at portraying Chelsea as precocious and simplifying her view of the world grated on me, and the new improved alien-overlord version of Chelsea isn't any better.Most of the characters continue to function as straw men than people. More supporting characters appear, including a newly-inaugurated president and his Chief of Staff, the idealistic Vanessa Colbourn. Her only role appears to be to provide resistance to the Cold War, hardline tactics of Murray Longworth. Together, the two of them function as the \"angel and devil\" on the shoulders of President Gutierrez, who wasn't really expecting to have to deal with a domestic crisis so early in his presidential career. Vanessa usually speaks up to disagree with Murray. Other characters, like Marcus, Gitsh, and \"Dr. Dan,\" serve similar roles in other areas of the plot. I get the sense that Sigler is trying to explore the ramifications of the moral choices that he has his characters make\u2014which is admirable, except that the ramifications never really surface. After the explosive climax, there's a terse epilogue. Maybe we'll see some more consequences in the next book, but I won't hold my breath.Thankfully, if the characters have not much improved in Contagious, their relationships have. I won't comment on Margaret and Clarence . . . because there are some better examples, most notably the bond between Dew and Perry. At Margaret and Murray's urgings, Dew tries to bond with Perry in order to convince the former Triangle host to stop killing other infected people. This relationship is also crucial to the most compelling aspect of both Infected and Contagious: Perry Dawsey's battle to reclaim his humanity.In Infected, Perry's primary struggle is for control over his body and mind with the parasites growing inside him. These are gone by the second book, but Perry can still communicate with them thanks to the mesh of fibres left in his brain. They still try to drive him to kill, but thanks to Dew, he demonstrates that he is more in control now. No, now Perry must deal with the guilt over what he did while under the influence of the Triangles, including the murder of his friend Bill. I say that this is the most compelling part of the series because it's the most real and the most significant theme. There's nothing simple about Perry's situation. There are no easy answers. Although few, if any of us, know what it's like to be infected by alien parasites, we can still empathize with Perry's struggle against what seems like insurmountable forces bent on preventing him from choosing his own path in life.I loved what more we learned about the alien aggressors. Firstly, we meet the Orbital, the interstellar craft sent by a species bent on colonizing Earth and converting humans into slave labour. The Orbital is just a machine following a complex program designed to maximize the probability of taking over a planet. It's wonderful. And Sigler builds the mythology of his universe well, explaining why the aliens are building wormhole gates instead of travelling to Earth in spaceships. There's little exposition, which fits nicely with the fast-paced atmosphere of the book.If this were a movie, its special effects budget would be on steroids. I mean, the protagonists drop a nuclear bomb on Detroit! It doesn't get much more audacious than that. Hopefully we'll see the fallout (pun intended) of that action in more detail in the third book, as I've already mentioned that Contagious provides a spare conclusion. Beyond this complaint, I can't find fault with much else when it comes to pacing and action scenes. There's less gore (which I appreciate) but still a good deal of squick (burnt bodies, skin sloughing off faces and hands, etc.). In a true moment of horror and tragedy, Amos dies, something I actually regret. But what is up with all the deaths at the end of the book? Were they just to make Clarence and Margaret the only survivors? It certainly wasn't a measure required to increase the body count. . . .Scott Sigler has both talent and room for improvement. I enjoyed his books, but they're definitely for a distinct audience. If you liked Infected, you'll like Contagious. If the former didn't interest you, I don't see why the latter will. Aliens, Triangles, and tactical nukes . . . oh my!"}, {"userName": "Ninetailedkat", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51843390-ninetailedkat", "userReview": "I am listening to this series on audio. Second in the series there was some predictability but had many good fast paced exciting moments and a few surprises. There continues to be portions of pretty good scientific explanation of different processes - some people won't like that but I did. I was wondering how the author was going to get to the 3rd sequel given how the second book was developing and although I didn't expect him to go that route, I kind of feel like it was a bit weak for that link. If you read it you will see what I mean. I will finish the series since I have gotten this far and would like to see how the author wraps it up. I kind of look at this series as a \"beach read for horror/science fiction\" and I am enjoying it even though it isn't the deepest thing you will ever read. I try to mix in my heavier reading with \"light reads and guilty pleasure\" books. I know some people have complained of the author narrating his own books - I don't think he is that bad personally. Very tolerable in fact (I have heard some really bad ones). Spoiler.... Sadly many of the characters I grew attached to won't be around for book three - there were actually two I was hoping would for sure be present in the last book even if they didn't make it in the end."}, {"userName": "David Veith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63058702-david-veith", "userReview": "5.0 Great fun!

And the actions of the parasite were interesting thanks to Sigler's skill at writing about technical stuff.Underneath that... Infected was a bunch of cardboard characters going through scripted motions in a Hollywood action flick.Contagious doubled down on the bad elements and disposed of the good.The characters return and are less likable, believable, and interesting than before. Hell, the aliens and their main host are the most developed and interesting characters in the novel! However, unlike in a Dean Koontz book where the bad guys are awesome enough to make up for how insufferable the good guys are, the bad guys are kind of ridiculous.But the book does not embrace its ridiculousness. It takes itself seriously and bathes heavily in manly-man bonding tropes, yay for militarism cliches, and rather dull gunplay and overdone technical descriptions.The emotional impact is supposed to come from the not-subtle theme of utilitarian sacrifices (of other people) for the (uncertain) common good. But because the characters are cartoonish and the terrible decisions are so obviously planned to happen, it is all very blunt. The aliens' plans and the human's plans seem less about trying to win and more about setting up all the terrible events the author wanted to push in in order to \"build character\" in the cartoonish drones that inhabit his fictional world.The part of me that wanted to read the next one anyway changed its mind at the really obnoxious \"oh yeah, there is another book after this one\" ending, one that makes even the ending of the first book seem subtle.I don't want to think too hard because I might come to think if I put more thought into Nocturnal, my first and favorite book by Sigler, I'd find I hate it too."}, {"userName": "Theresa Leone Davidson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson", "userReview": "Three and a half stars, actually. Reasons I enjoyed the novel are first. Yes, it was very exciting, a race against the clock kind of thing to save humanity, literally, from aliens. The novel Infected was the first, it introduced the characters that are in Contagious, and the action takes place mere weeks after Infected ended. It is about triangles that embed themselves under the skin of unsuspecting human hosts, grow, and pop out (killing the host, of course) as ugly little creatures that are intent upon building a gateway of sorts for others from their planet to come. If you like horror, both novels are great; if you like science fiction, both of these novels are perfect. The characters are well developed, people the reader comes to feel that they know. Entertaining stuff, if you can handle the gore. Two of my favorite lines: \"She wanted to spend way too much for a Starbucks and sit down and read PEOPLE or US WEEKLY, something truly brain dead, because she wanted to be brain dead\" and \"You think I'm some inbred trailer-trash hick that watches the Springer show?\" Both lines are funny, which brings to me what I didn't like about the novel. Sequels, in novels or films, rarely are as good as the original. It happens, just not often. One of the attributes I most liked about Infected was that there was humor in it, a lot of of it, some of it laugh-out-loud funny, and it was a relief from the horror. There is not nearly that much humor in Contagious, and what you are left with is just the horror. Still a fun read, but not as enjoyable. I also didn't care for the way one character, the only lead female character in the story, behaved at times, as though Sigler believes women will have difficulty seeing the 'big picture,' or doing what is necessary under extreme circumstances. A minor complaint but a complaint nonetheless. The other reasons I did not enjoy the novel quite as much have to do with the ending and I won't state them here. Suffice it to say, I would recommend both books but the first is the best."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5913149-sandy", "userReview": "They\u2019re back and they\u2019re more determined to set up a base in the U.S but time is running out. This series takes right off where Infected left off with Perry hearing the triangles conversing; only something is different this time. The chatter is different this time and there is one voice which is dominating the conversation. Perry doesn\u2019t want to confront this voice and the feeling is mutual as Chelsea is told to stay away from this powerful force who is trying to track her down. This is not the only struggle as there is a fight between saving the lives of the individuals who are infected and trying to preserve the modified triangles emerging out on infected individuals, around the country. They can\u2019t save both. Just how is this new strain of the virus being passed and how can they stop the bodies from piling up? With a young child leading the group, they seem to be winning this assault on the U.S., as Margaret and her team run from city to city, always one step behind.Just like Infected, Scott Sigler produced a novel that had me racing through the paging just wondering if Margaret and her team were ever going to get the upper hand on the virus which was plaguing the country. I felt that this novel was not as gory or shocking as the first novel in the series but it was more scientific and technical in explaining what was occurring. Margaret tried to take charge of the situation yet the virus had the upper hand. I enjoyed the tension, the excitement of the novel and having the return of some the same characters from Infected. You could read this as a standalone novel as the author provides a brief intro of book one at the beginning but to get the full effect, I suggest reading the first book in the series."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5846407-bill", "userReview": "The voices are back.

This time the stakes are even higher. Scott picks up where he left off in the first book and takes you on a wild action ride (again). This time his rag tag group of heroes must battle the contagion and keep it from destroying an entire city.

The story picks up sometime after Infected, with the main character somehow kept alive and in the (sort of) employ of the government. He's used to track down the alien bad guys, and as is usual with alien bad guys, the scientists/agents around him have different agendas. Contagious has a broader scope than Infected, and is a more satisfying read because of it.

Across America, a mysterious pathogen transforms ordinary people into raging killers, psychopaths driven by a terrifying, alien agenda. The human race fights back, yet after every battle the disease responds, adapts, using sophisticated strategies and brilliant ruses to fool its pursuers. The only possible explanation: the epidemic is driven not by evolution but by some malevolent intelligence.Standing against this unimaginable threat is a small group, assembled under the strictest secrecy. Their best weapon is hulking former football star Perry Dawsey, left psychologically shattered by his own struggles with this terrible enemy, who possesses an unexplainable ability to locate the disease's hosts. Violent and unpredictable, Perry is both the nation's best hope and a terrifying liability. Hardened CIA veteran Dew Phillips must somehow forge a connection with him if they're going to stand a chance against this maddeningly adaptable opponent. Alongside them is Margaret Montoya, a brilliant epidemiologist who fights for a cure even as she reels under the weight of endless horrors. These three and their team have kept humanity in the game, but that's not good enough anymore, not when the disease turns contagious, triggering a fast countdown to Armageddon. Meanwhile, other enemies join the battle, and a new threat -- one that comes from a most unexpected source -- may ultimately prove the most dangerous of all.Catapulting the reader into a world where humanity's life span is measured in hours and the president's finger hovers over the nuclear button, rising star Scott Sigler takes us on a breathtaking, hyper-adrenalized ride filled with terror and jaw-dropping action. Contagious is a truly grand work of suspense, science, and horror from a new master.", "title": "Contagious\n      \n          (Infected #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3605324-contagious", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388273040l/3605324.jpg", "reviews": 585, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/114504.Scott_Sigler", "name": "Scott Sigler"}], "type": ["Horror", "Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3605324-contagious", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7020612-virulent", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12236891-contagious", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6602970-contagious", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6965301-contagious", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13614050-contagious", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6691671-contagious", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7084606-contagious", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2331954.Infected", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23278532-alive", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/481601.Ancestor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12099550-nocturnal", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8087710-pandemic"]}
