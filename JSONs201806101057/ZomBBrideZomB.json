I have to say this was also maybe the creepiest and oddest book of the series. It was creepy because of the zombie babies. I was really creeped out by them. It was odd because of Mr. Drowning's love for B. I thought it was like a straight out obsession. I did find it interesting to learn more about Mr. Drowning and the zombie babies that he created. I thought B was good through most of the book, and then made me remember who she really was at the end. The ending was great. I can't wait to read Book 11. Only two more books to read in the series. I can't wait to see how it goes.

B now uses her mind to battle the zombie threat. When Mr. Dowling asks her to marry him, at first she is rightfully disgusted by the proposal. But then she sees, if she bargains with him, that she can get him to stop murdering people. That would be a significant start to ending the violence that is all she knows of the world any more.I really enjoyed learning of the backstory of both B and Mr. Dowling. I liked seeing how Mr. Shan is developing the secondary characters, and making them as interesting as the main ones.There is hardly any actual fighting involved which I enjoyed. The focus was on the history of the threat, how the babies came to be, B's reason for having nightmares about them, and learning more about that mysterious man, Mr. Dowling.There is also a person from B's past who shows up working for Mr. Dowling, teaching the babies a new kind of ABC's. A is for Atrocity, G is for Guts, etc. As a former teacher, and now a nanny, I will never look at the ABC's, in the same way ever again!"}, {"userName": "Chappy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19932497-chappy", "userReview": "Everything I wanted since first meeting Mr Dowling all the books ago, getting more of his back story and learning just how he fits into Shans mythology for his zombie infested world and the larger scale plan he has in place for the warring factions. It was great to get an insight into the forces that B has been working against since the beginning, up to this point they have only been something we see from afar but never get to see up close. We are now privy to the deepest and darkest secrets of the stories antagonist and the plans he has, these may have been changed with the ending of this novel but now is the time in which the story reaches its climax and we will begin to see the end. How will Mr Dowling react to the latest events to transpire?? How will Rage and Owl Man impact the end of the story and can it really all be put to right or will this series; much like the rest of Shans have a massively twisted end. I couldn't put this book down and simply destroyed it over a day, I hope to return to this world within a few weeks to see what happens and see the stage set for what may come in the final instalment.

Things are not looking good. Except things are not as bad as they seem. Mr. Dowling has grand plans for B & they are pretty obvious from the title of the book. But surely B would never agree to such a thing...This book is all about Mr. Dowling. He's a villain I've not been overly keen on thus far, too absurd & silent. But all that changes here. He's given a voice, although not in the obvious way, and we find out a lot more about him & who he was before he went mad. He is made more real & for the first time we have reason to sympathise with him.We also learn more about the babies and B's connection to them. The creepy babies become weirdly likeable in this book, which I wouldn't have expected. A great continuation of the series, less action-packed & more plot-driven but none the worse for it.

Being carried across London by a hoarde of zombie babies is seriously creepy and a brilliant image, but I was more disturbed by B\u2019s seeming ease with the babies! But once they arrived at Mr Dowling\u2019s it suddenly made sense. In revealing his plan, Dowling shed some light on some of the stranger things he\u2019s done to help B over the course of the series. It was a total surprise and I love the direction it took, even if it was slightly creepy.As B spent more and more time with Mr Dowling, and communicating with him in surprising ways, I actually began to feel a little sorry for him. He was a man once and Zom-B Bride explored that wonderfully; his dissent into crazytown and how it has affected his judgement and morality was really interesting. I love how Darren Shan uses Mr Dowling to look at good and evil and how it can blur when you put the actual human being into the equation.

For any faults he may have, the earnestness with which he writes makes any of his books a pleasant reading experience. Darren's imagination is broad and his ability to plot a long series, maintaining interest by slowly revealing information, is quite impressive. While most people like the novels with a lot of action, for me his best books are usually the slower paced volumes that provide us with insight into the author's imagination, the inner workings of a story. The Lake of Souls was my favourite in the Saga, Dark Calling my favourite of the Demonata, both because they gave answers to questions posed half a dozen books ago. With the exception of possibly the first book (my lengthy review of that one is here https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), Zom-B bride is perhaps my favourite in the series so far, as it provides us with uniquely imagined answers and explanations."}, {"userName": "Emma Streets", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30141345-emma-streets", "userReview": "Darren shan never fails i always go into one of his books knowing im going to love it and im always right.

I'm sorry, but I couldn't help myself. I inserted those lines mentally during - SPOILER - the wedding scene. I know, there's something wrong with me.Zom-B Bride manages to up the series' game of throwing our minds a curve ball. Some massive questions are answered; keen insights are made into our more mysterious characters; and the series rattles along as it comes ever closer to its completion. Bride comes down a gear in terms of pace, which is both a blessing and a curse, but I'm still infuriated over the fact I'm going to have to wait for the next instalment.My patience sucks!SPOILER ALERTB has been brought to the belly of the beast, and part of her doesn't care.She took a beating, and enough is enough.She's done her part, right?Well, the crazy she knew before is about to be obliterated.And a new crazy will take its place.Get set for the wedding of the century!Zom-B Bride is filled with exposition. So much so that action takes a backseat, and the pace suffers for it. But when the answers we're getting are this good, it's barely a problem. This entry's plot is full of insanity and events that you'd never have thought would take place. B, the mother of demon-like babies? What!? B, getting ready to marry the series' big bad Mr Dowling? Stop! B, messing with our minds to the point we almost believe she's turning evil? I don't believe you.Wait, all of that happens?That, and more.And the action does pick up again when we reach another cliffhanger ending.Oh how I hate and love in equal measure cliffhanger endings.Zom-B Bride's main source of suspense, is the way B tries to work from inside the belly of the beast. She reached new moral heights in Family, where she stepped up into the person she, herself, wanted to be. The prospect of it all being unravelled is terrifying. There are a few moments in the book where I thought we were going to lose her. It's highlighted by her warming up to the mutant babies - who still creep me the hell out - especially when she finds out that, technically, her genetics were instrumental in creating them.Although, is it bad that I want an army of crazy powerful babies on my side too?What I'm not so keen on, is the union of B and Mr Dowling. The decision doesn't fully resonate with me, mainly because I don't think B's reasoning suited her. A lot of emphasis is put on her need and want to help Mr Dowling, who over the course of the novel, becomes much more pitiable.The expansion of the clown though is great. He's been a creepy, visual character from the moment he was introduced, but in Bride we get a very literal look into his mind. We see how he ticks, what he used to be, what he wants. We don't get to see what made him what he is, but the fleshing out of his character really lends weight to the themes of good and evil, and how one is always tainted by the other.Bride gives us some much awaited answers, and focuses heavily on its characters. Everything is shaping up.I think I stayed up too late to write this, part of me feels I should have done better.That's what lack of sleep does to you. Makes you paranoid and overtly critical.On a brighter note, that's not really that bright, I want the next entry now...\nRead more book-orientated posts over on my website: Matthew R.

This is the 9 or 10 book made by him in the series. In the last book she was tortured by a man who called himself Dan Dan! He was a sociopath who would kidnap and torture kids to deaths. She was rescued by her enemy who was a zombie/humans clown who led an army of mutants . Becky rescued as many humans as she could in the time that the facility was being overrun by mutants. During the battle she was hurt from the wounds that were all over her body which were cause by Dan Dan. She was later carried by the evil tiny zombie babies whore took her underground into a sewage system were the evil clown HQ was located. This part of the story got really weird because the clown ask becky to marry him. At first Becky refused but later on she thought for some crazy reason that she might be able to change the clowns mind to stop killing people. She accepted the proposal from the evil clown and then they went into a secret room were the clown used an electric wire to zap both of them in the head to link their memory together and share their knowledge. Becky was searching his memory for a toxin tube that could kill all the living human left on the earth. She found the vile tube but at the same time the evil clown found out Becky's intentions and he separated there memory link. They were both trying to regain their body's movement but the shock from the electric was still in effect. The evil clown gain control of his body and tried to choke becky that gave becky time to regain her body\u2019s control since zombies can not suffocate. Becky got up and used the electric wire and used it to zap the evil clown on the heads almost to death. She was still healing from getting tortured and was exhausted and just when she thought that she was good to go the evil babies came because she hurt the evil clown. The babies were starting to rip Becky apart and she tried to get them of her but there were too many. When she thought that it was the end for her one of the babies who had a hole in it\u2019s forehead and who had some history with becky told the others that becky was their mother and that they shouldn\u2019t hurt her! The babies all thought about it and then apologize for hurting Becky. She thank the babe who had a hole on it\u2019s forehead and left the HQ.

(To Be Continued) My Favorite character was Becky because she found a way to trick Mr. Dowling to give up Sleshinger 10. My least favorite characters were a lot of the babies because in my opinion they didn't know better and attacked Becky by accident. one thing that Becky Could've done better was not betray Mr. Dowling so Much because there is a good possibility that he could attack Becky and her friends in the next book. One thing that Becky did great at was tricking Mr. Dowling into giving her the Vial of Sleshinger 10. One thing that Mr. Dowling could have done better was realize earlier that Becky Smith was tricking him the whole time he thought that she was on his side. My favorite moment in the book was went Becky escaped with the vial because I personally want her to end zombies and return the control back to the humans again. My least favorite part of the book is when Becky and Mr. Dowling got married because I think it was unnecessary for her to marry him to get the Vial of Sleshinger 10.

It was more of an information book. In this book we see more of Owl Man and Mr.Dowling. B is taken to Mr.Dowlings lair/home in secret subway tunnels. We find out what the creepy babies are, how they came to be and why they call B mummy all the time. We also fins out a lot about Mr.Dowling. Mr. Dowling communicates mentally with his followers and he establishes this connection using electricity. He shocks B and from then on he is able to communicate with her. In this book we find out about who Mr. Dowling was before he went bat s*** crazy, how he is connected to Owl Man and Dr. Oystein, what role he has in the zombie and mutant gene and why he is obsessed with B. B stays in Mr.Dowling's \"house\" the entire book. She is brought there and at first, Mr. Dowling takes care of her injured body. However it becomes clear that she is not free to leave there. She is repeatedly shocked with electricity and is allowed more access to Mr.Dowling's brain each time. He loves B and he wants her to have access to his whole memory but he won't allow it until she agrees to marry him. In this book, the reader can begin to take pity on Mr.Dowling and become soft when it comes to him. B's opinion of him changes and while she doesn't love him or anything, has to make the decision to marry him or not. She wants to get a good deal out it, ensuring the safety of people.

Oh my, it's so wonderful getting to know Mr Dowling better! I wish they would have said exactly what turned him into what he is... I still think there is so much more to him than what Mr Shan is letting us know. The story was as gory as I expected it to be AND I'm so glad that we finally get to see what the babies are all about and how they came to be. CREEPY! Only two more books on the seires..so very sad!"}, {"userName": "Paul McAvoy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17651386-paul-mcavoy", "userReview": "This is the tenth in the series of Zom B books. It's a slow burner, and quite probably the oddest in the series yet with the blood bathing, gruesome mother-love and edginess. We learn more about Mr Downing and the 'babies.' And Mr Downing's strange love for B Smith. An electrifying finish in which we probably see the the end in sight."}], "description": "B Smith has been rescued from the den of torture she\u2019d been trapped in\u2014but her savior is none other than the murderous maniac clown Mr. Dowling.
