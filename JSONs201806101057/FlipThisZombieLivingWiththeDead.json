Instead of marriage counseling, this one used business. You can tell the next one will be carbon copy with life-affirming statements (\nEat Slay Love\n? Uh huh).I'd thought the first book had left off with our heroes heading off to find Sarah's father? Maybe I misunderstood, because this book had them near Phoenix, offering their services as zombie exterminators. A group of survivors had banded together in a compound and a scavenging/barter system had developed. There's a mad scientist (not a spoiler, the back of the book blurb says this) who is altering zombies (maybe a spoiler, whatever). Instead of David being stupidly trusting, Sarah is stupidly trusting. It works out in the end.There's mention of a Midwest wall, keeping zombies away from people on the east coast. I don't know, this sketches out a situation and then zooms in close-up to one couple, but since World War Z was my first zombie-craze read everything else has been shoddy in comparison. I can't shut off massive portions of my head for long enough to really enjoy this.HUGEST PEEVE EVER. The last book's dialogue was all \"he whispered\" and \"she whispered,\" so much communication whispered. This one changed it up with \"he said softly\" and \"she said softly.\" YaAAHAHAGHghaghhghghgh! Is this a writing tic? My reading tic began making every occurence of \"whispered\" and \"softly\" pulse with it's own neon beat. \"I hate this,\" I whisper softly to myself.The best thing about this series is that I lent the first book out at work and it got passed around. Someone ended up buying this second book and lent it to me. I have a few people who now occasionally ask me what I'm reading and will take what I offer. Sadly, it seems to have been a flash in the pan trend, but I just started the most persistent one on Bujold and he's currently on the 2nd book. I'm not letting this fish off the hook.

Why? Because it's campy and silly and I think David and Sarah are one of the most realistic, cutest couples ever. There isn't any fake insta love stuff going on here, just more good times built on from the first book. I had a bit of an issue with the whole 'mad scientist and genius kid' theme that was going on, but Ms. Petersen manages to carry it with well placed jokes and a natural talent for writing. There are some authors out there with credentials galore that think they can write but fail miserably. This is almost the opposite. Ms. Petersen has a wonderful, casual tone that just seems so right, especially for this genre. I would love it she would continue with other urban fantasy novels in the future.

It was almost a record scratch reaction that had me re-examining the thing I liked the most about it - the marriage between the two main characters. Then when there was a reconciliation I kept waiting for Sarah to say, \"David, let's talk about what you said earlier to me.\" But no, nothing. I'm sure if Sarah had said the same thing to David he would have definitely mentioned it. And then the ending was unbelievable. An 11 year old - really!?!

It makes sense but in reality, after the first year, anyone alive can handle themselves. Know one would be contacting them and there wouldn't be phones or email to get in touch with them. There PR would be pretty much putting up posters in a small area. Oh, and the address on the sign to reach them would make them easy targets to kill and rob.

I love anything with zombies in and when I first picked up this series I was intrigued. A married couple going through counselling then watching their therapist eating the previous clients.

Oh yeah, and it has also rendered the majority of the world population as insatiable, flesh-hungry, shambling monsters. Despite the loss of creature comforts and the uptick in the undead population, however, life After Zombies has been pretty good for married couple Sarah and David. See, before the apocalypse, their marriage was on its last legs and destined for a bitter divorce. But zombies have a way of bringing even the most pissed off couples together \u2013 and Sarah and David discover that, hey, they\u2019re at their best when they\u2019re bludgeoning, shooting, and hacking the undead to pieces. Teamwork. They has it.With their new company, Zombiebusters Exterminators, Inc., Sarah and David have been cleaning up the arid southwest with trademark snark, taking on jobs in exchange for food, beer, medical supplies, and anything else they can wrangle from the humans living together in the survivor camps across the nation. Sarah and David think they have seen it all \u2013 but then reports start rolling in about so-called bionic zombies (TM Sarah, naturally) that have higher thought processes and faster reflexes. Then, the Zombiebuster duo get a job from an honest-to-goodness mad scientist (camped out in a secret subterranean lab and everything) to start catching zombies and bring them back alive (err\u2026or still animated, I should say), because the doc says he may have a cure that could save the planet. As enamored as Sarah is with the possibility of a future with civilization back intact, David\u2019s cynicism means he cannot help but suspect that something more foul is afoot. And he\u2019s right.Something\u2019s rotten in the state of Arizona, and it ain\u2019t just the corpses. It\u2019s up to Sarah and David to figure out the truth before it bites them in the ass.As I\u2019ve said before, I loved Married with Zombies \u2013 not so much because of any novelty in terms of zombie lore or the apocalypse, but because of the situational humor and characters involved. I finished Married with Zombies with an insatiable desire for more, and I am thrilled to report that Flip This Zombie delivers.1 Interestingly, Flip This Zombie runs opposite of its predecessor \u2013 the humor is toned down in this volume (although it is, of course, still present and still awesome), and the more interesting developments occur in terms of plotting and action. Although the mad scientist trope isn\u2019t anything new, the schlock value and pure fun of this book more than make up for the lack of originality. Plus, what can I say, I love me a mad science lab. Especially when it\u2019s a secret underground lab in the middle of the desert. Clearly, someone has been playing/watching Resident Evil and it totally shows in this lovely homage to Alice kicking souped-up zombie ass \u2013 and I love that the characters in the book address this, too. At one point, David makes the jibe that one character must have watched too much RE and found themselves rooting for the Umbrella Corporation instead of the hot chick. Yes. FUN. There are also a ton of other pop culture references, from Mad Max to even a Drago/Rocky IV \u201cI must break you\u201d drop which had me in giggles (who doesn\u2019t love Rocky IV?!).That\u2019s not to say Flip This Zombie is merely a collection of glib pop-geekery, however, as there are a number of interesting and complicating plot developments. Despite Sarah\u2019s sense of humor, it\u2019s clear that the world has become a bleak and unforgiving place, and David\u2019s jaded attitude \u2013 and fear for Sarah\u2019s safety \u2013 speaks to this. When the couple run across an eleven year old boy that has somehow inexplicably survived the outbreak and subsequent months by himself in the desert, this danger is hammered home all the more. On that note I should say that I loved the addition of The Kid; swearing like there\u2019s no tomorrow, feral and badass, he totally reminded me of Short Round from Temple of Doom, but minus the accent and wrapped in a Bart Simpson package. I digress.The coolest thing about this book is the fact that the story is progressing. There is a degree of discontinuity from the first entry, however, as there\u2019s no real exploration of the marital issues that had bothered the couple before, and their presence in Arizona of all places instead of heading east towards their families was initially jarring (although the rationale is explained). Yet these are minor flaws in a wholly entertaining novel. There\u2019s a twist at the end that should prove interesting for book 3 (or at least is fodder for some new ground), and I am very excited to see where Sarah and David take us next on their road trip eastwards across a zombie-overrun America. I\u2019ll be back for thirds."}, {"userName": "Sinn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4693342-sinn", "userReview": "After the first book, I was really looking forward to the next two in the series. However, I wondered whether the author would be able to keep up with Sarah's snarky humor. And, in that regard, the author does not disappoint.This book picks up a few months after the ending of the last book. The Government has bombed major cities in an attempted to control the zombie population. While getting rid of a few, it has left shells of buildings for zombies to hide in and killed survivors. However, the remaining survivors are finding a way to make the best of a bad situation. They have started making tent settlements, a trade system, and so on. After the adventures of the last book, Sarah and Dave decide to go into business as for-hire zombie killers. And it seems as though business is booming. That is until they get a rather strange client wanting them to capture \"live\" zombies for medical testing. And, if that fiasco isn't enough, they are hearing rumors of a newer, faster, and smart zombie\u2014bionic zombies. As you can imagine, Sarah and Dave have differing opinions concerning both issues and are stretched to the limit.I found it hilarious that Sarah and Dave started a zombie killing business. Even though she was a little timid about picking up a gun, after the first book Sarah took to killing quite easily. And that doesn't even take into account Dave's mad-Halo-skills! So, to me, it seemed natural. The concept of the bionic zombies was interesting. It stands to reason that there might be a different mutation. I really liked how it played into the book and the story line. I wonder how this new mutation will play into the next book.Dr. Barnes was an interesting character. From the onset, I was distrustful of him. He seemed too good to be true, and he gave me a weird vibe. However, I found Sarah's blind faith to be a little too naive, especially considering everything they had already been through.The ending was a little too campy for me. Without giving anything away, The Kid's ability seemed a little Deus ex machina. Granted, we are kind of led into it by the comment that he is a genius, but . . . It was just too neat and out of the blue for me to appreciate.While this book is very much in the spirit of the other, I felt that it didn't live up to the awesomeness of the first book. Even though they snarky humor was still present, I felt it was too pushed. Further, the book relied too heavily on Sarah's little quips and asides. It ended up just being too over the top and forced. The first one had something special, and it felt as though the author wasn't willing to give this book something uniquely it's own. Even though it was a fast and fun read, I am a little concerned about the next book."}, {"userName": "Corie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2129324-corie", "userReview": "I know the premise for the \"zombie apocalypse\" is not a new idea. But somehow, seeing the potential for the \"what ifs\" and how amazingly easy it would be for some sort of biological weapon, or sorts, released on accident, could spread was disturbing. Something passed with even a small break of the skin, can far too easily clear a wide and fast swath across cities, states or even the country. Eeek. And that is scary. What is worse is what's left behind. The first book in this series was more about the disaster happening and figuring it out, whereas now in book two they've moved on to \"dealing\" and trying to make your way in the life (or should I say, the new death).What I enjoy the most about these books, and as it should be, are Sarah and David. I am completely rooting for them all throughout. Separately and together. Even when they seem to each take turns being an idiot. Really I just want them to be able to find a better future somewhere over the rainbow that does not include flesh eating, brains or black sludge. I loved both of their snarky wit, married banter and pop-culture references. Although their new life is full of dangerous and life threatening situations, they don't take themselves too seriously. Most of the time anyway. And The Kid was awesome. I have a daughter the exact same age as this character, so his actions, tween-nature, and situation really hit home for me. I hope we see more of him.The tone of this book wasn't near as full of the humor as the last, but they still managed to keep a light-heartedness to it even as they were kicking (or capturing) zombie ass or staring down the barrel of a gun.Anyway I am anxious for Sarah and David's story to move on to new places. I am glad to say that the end did NOT drop us off a cliff (as I was afraid of when nearing the end) and did not trickily leave me desperate to immediately read the next one. The end is instead a nice little breather to catch my breath before diving in to more zombie infested badlands and killing. And let me just say for the record... FLESH... after hearing it over and over in all of the ways it could be torn, bludgeoned, eaten, rotted, cut, hacked, blackened and oozing.... is NOT MY FAVORITE WORD."}, {"userName": "Cathy (cathepsut)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/978552-cathy-cathepsut", "userReview": "There is a zombie outbreak, people die, the government bombs cites to stop the worst from happening, it happens anyway. Enter Sarah and David, zombie exterminators extraordinaire.This is the second book of the series Living with the Dead. Think Dawn Of The Dead, only the heroes made it out alive. The survivors of the outbreak live in camps and the situation is dire. Sarah and David drive around in their truck, bitch at each other and pick up odd jobs from people who want some specific zombies cleared out from somewhere. Then rumours start to surface about especially vicious zombies, that are faster and nastier than your run of the mill walking undead.The book tries very hard to be funny and the first 10 pages of the book are so littered with swear words that even I frowned. I think I laughed out loud for the first time around page 80. I wasn\u2019t terribly impressed at first, because the beginning of the book is very shallow and the plot is not exactly complex. But the entertainment factor picked up eventually and I ended up having fun reading this. Mind you, shallow and simple plot\u2014if you don\u2019t figure out immediately, who the bad guy is and what he is up to, you are watching the wrong movies and reading the wrong books. The story is told in first person by Sarah. She fits the typical stereotype of the Urban Fantasy heroine. Good looking, gun-tooting and not shy. I wouldn\u2019t have minded if she had been a bit smarter though. I felt the urge to smack her upside the head several times. And her husband David stays painfully one dimensional. He\u2019s the sarcastic side kick with brawns and superior fire power, who tends to save the day. Sarah supposedly is the brains of the operation. God help them!There was one little plot twist at the end that I didn\u2019t see coming after all.

She and David still pick lots of fights and sometimes they got a bit annoying, they seriously fight over everything. On the other hand the zombie killing got way more professional, they went from toiletseats to axes and shotguns.

Just as expected, the 2nd book in Jesse Petersen's story built on the already very enjoyable first part of the series and brought in some new characters, new challenges and a glimmer into where the - cue movie voice - exciting conclusion is taking us! Will Sarah and David save the world? Their marriage? Or even ever eat pop tarts again? Even though we haven't totally moved out of the 'our marriage is in shambles' territory, 'Flip This Zombie' - seriously, what a great title - moves our brave protagonists' relationship into a much more, well, mature level of tension. I can't even imagine doing half of what is described with my own wife without even giving an inclination as to how WE'RE doing (no one would ever know, his brain whispered...). Um, sorry, where was I? Oh yeah, I loved this book! Laugh out loud humor, real tension and the ever-present glimpse into human nature that those of us that believe in a Dystopian Tomorrow have come to expect! But as I was afraid, the fun was over far too quickly! Just another great short story that I wished were going on and on, even beyond Book 3.

Things are going well until they land a customer that wants them to capture zombies and bring them to him still alive. Or still undead? Anyway, he doesn\u2019t want them killed. What in the world does he want with live zombies? That\u2019s what Dave and Sarah want to find out.Flip This Zombie had a lot of surprise twists and was just as campy and fun as Married with Zombies.

I really enjoyed \"the kid\" I hope that we find out more about what happens with him in the next book. The middle half of book kind of let me down(I can\u2019t really explain why without giving away plot points). The ending of the book made me want to download the next book in series to know what happens next to everyone.
