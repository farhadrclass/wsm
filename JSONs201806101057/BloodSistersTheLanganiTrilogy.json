This is one of those books which just hook me in, and I finished reading this spellbinding novel in just under 2 days. The characters are all achingly real and sad, and Piet especially is one of my favourite characters in terms of development and moments written of. The prologue was actually a bit too revealing, in my opinion, as i realised halfway throughout the book who all the people in question were, but thats not to say that I enjoyed it any less. I'm only 15 so most of the issues in 1950's Kenya were things i'd only treaded on whilst reading this book. i have to admit, some parts of the conversations about a newly independendent Kenya at the start were quite dull, but i realise that it would be what a lot of Afrikaners would be talking about with neighbours and friends, so i'm happy the Keating sisters included those parts. CONFESSION: i cried at the end of this book; not full blown sobbing, but a couple of tears were definitely shed, and it was the same thing for the sequel, A Durable Fire, which was breathtaking in itself. i'm normally very tough in books like these, when i know a tragedy is loomingly ominously at the end, but as i read this book in such a quick pace, the disaster was very heartfelt, and i felt sad for all the characters and myself because i had nearly finished the book and would land back on boring Earth instead of the idyllic-sounding Kenya which is a glory even with all the clashes between the countries and tribes. These Keating sisters are awesome story-tellers, and the way they describe the elephants especially is stunning, and i envy the three girls and their families for being able to experience all these captivating situations in the wild land that is Kenya. i have to admit Blood Sisters is near the top of my Favourite Books list, along with the sequel, and i have already started whining at my parents to take me on a safari to Kenya; who knows, i might even meet a daring adventurer like Anthony there! ;)"}, {"userName": "Teresa Proen\u00e7a", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6923777-teresa-proen-a", "userReview": "\u201cIrm\u00e3s de Sangue\u201d \u00e9 um romance muito bonito que nos conta est\u00f3rias de amor, de dor, de amizade...Tem passagens muito belas e comoventes, que me tocaram profundamente.E porque j\u00e1 estou com saudades de Sarah, de Hannah e de Camilla, vou mat\u00e1-las com \u201cUm Fogo Eterno\u201d..."}, {"userName": "Salisha Chandra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8019669-salisha-chandra", "userReview": "Really enjoyed this book, it is well written and absorbing. The story of the three friends and how their lives change after school yet how important the bond that they share is to each of them at all times is something most of us can identify with. Even more interesting is the parallels one can draw to the situation with poaching and wildlife crimes in those days post independence to what is happening today. At times it is a lot like a fairy-tale romance but then there are some harsh realities woven into the plot that really ground the book.

Recordo-me de que a Sarah foi sempre apaixonada pelo irm\u00e3o da Hannah, o Piet, e que o Piet foi sempre um capacho da Camilla (at\u00e9 certo ponto). Depois recordo-me de que a Camilla era apaixonada por um homem da savana que combate ca\u00e7adores ilegais, o Anthony, e que este Anthony \u00e9 um mulherengo.

They are completely different, from each other, as their backgrounds are grounded in three separate cultures. A new country is created and they start on their long journey of friendship. They promise each other at their graduation they will meet on their 21st birthday at Hannah's family's ranch in the upcountry of the newly formed upcountry of Kenya. They separate with one girl, Sarah, going to Dublin to study zoology, while glamorous Camilla launches her career accidentally in modeling and Afrikaner Hannah retreats to Rhodesia with her family after Kenya gains its independence. But what dark secrets does Hannah's family keep that would send them into oblivion to civil war torn Rhodesia. This book has a war driven political plot line with much violence. Kenya's farm driven economy needs to diversify and surge forward with a more tourist driven economy. Although the author does not enlighten us with all of Kenya's problems the country faces, she does provide enough distress that the reader will see a spiraling country out of control with graft, horrific acts of violence and crooked government officials to name a few of the problems. The girls are equally off balance as they try to find balance in their lives. It seems if it can go wrong, it will go wrong. Will they be able to culminate their blood sister oath? Should they even go out on a limb to make their 21st birthday a \"happening\". They each discover their strengths and weaknesses as they circumvent the map of their new country. This a great read that does not try to celebrate the ole East African Protectorate, but examines the ups and downs of a young nation as it takes its place as a leader in Animal preservation. It squarely examines the cultures and different tribes.
