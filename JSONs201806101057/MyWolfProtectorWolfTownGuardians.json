My Wolf Protector by Rose Wynters is filled with everything this wolf-lover loves! Marrok is a hot, handsome, strong, protective, alpha wolf, normally rigidly self-controlled, but he has scented his mate on a dark, secluded road and she is in trouble. Taylor is a \u201cplus-sized\u201d accountant who finds herself in need of rescuing from a group of drunken bikers. In one of those sigh-worthy moments, Marrok rides in on his motorcycle and saves Taylor, knowing that this amazing creature is his mate for life. When she vanishes off the face of the Earth, he\u2019s destroyed and for thirty years has mourned her loss. When two badly beaten and tortured werewolves come to him and say they were sent by Taylor, what can he do but go after her and save her once again from the nightmare she has been living as a prisoner/guinea pig in a hidden government facility running experiments on werewolves? But Taylor is changed, she is like a zombie, unemotional and guarded. Can Marrok break through her years of imprisonment and drugging to gain her heart and trust? What has been done to her that has kept her looking as youthful as the last time he saw her? Why does this human woman have wolf DNA in her? He\u2019ll kill whoever has touched HIS woman, but first, she has to realize she is only meant for him! Meanwhile, Taylor doesn\u2019t think she is worthy or capable of being with someone like Marrok. Is this going to become a game of cat & mouse?Author Rose Wynters wrote for those of us who are less than perfect according to those impossible \u201cBarbie\u201d standards and did it with creative style and a fresh plot! Firmly establishing her world, and building in strong characters, this crisp and intense tale will keep those pages turning, although you may want oven mitts as the tension heats to boiling between Taylor and Marrok. The character dialogue is spot on and the emotions fly off the pages. With a few comedic breaks from another hot wolf, Connor, I could take a much needed breath as I raced through this captivating read! was riveted from start to finish and will definitely look for more from Rose Wynters\u2019 magic pen.A review copy was provided as part of Ms. Wynters\u2019 blog tour in exchange for my honest review.Publication Date: September 2, 2013Number of Pages: 263Genre: Erotic Romance, Paranormal Romance, Werewolf Romance, and BBW RomanceRecommended Age: ADULTS*This book contains explicit language and extremely sensual adult scenes.* Amazon\u00a0\nBarnes & Noble\u00a0\n\nAll Romance Ebooks\u00a0\n\nFor more reviews check out Tome Tender's Book Blog or find us on Facebook."}, {"userName": "Carrie (Book Fairy) Fort ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7117403-carrie-book-fairy-fort", "userReview": "Favorite Lines \u201cIf you only knew how long I've waited for someone like you to walk into my life.\u201d\u201cMarrok, your mate is alive.\u201d\u201cWell, shit,\u201d he finally muttered to himself. \u201cI hate being left out of the action.

He's amazing! When he meets his mate Taylor he was so happy and then he woke up and she was gone! No sign, no scent, no word. It breaks my heart! 31 years later 2 almost dead wolves tell them she's been alive this whole time and is being held. Marrok shows his true warrior spirit and reading about him in that moment was spectacular! Amazing!Taylor was terrorized for 31 yrs but, she is such an amazing woman! So strong! Most woman well anyone really would have crumbled but not her! She rose above it gloriously! Rose Wynters does it again! She does it with style, class, and so much yumminess!

Not all the time, just enough to drive me nuts. The storyline was good, and without the errors it would have been even better. I thought a book about a hot Native American werewolf biker would be pretty sweet. I mean, just one of those usually is enough, but a combination of all three? Nice! For the most part it was. The characters were likeable, even lustable. *wink* Marrok is the main character and he's very controlled, but still so yummy. Taylor is his mate who has been captured and put through hell. The way they work themselves back to each other is good, very believable. The way the book wrapped up was good, and I thought it picked up all the pieces nicely. I give it 3 1/2 stars.I received a copy of this book in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Yvonne Daniels", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27383555-yvonne-daniels", "userReview": "GreatGreatI really enjoyed the second book in this series it has a excellent mystery and romance I love that the women have curvy bodies let's you know big girls are loveable too.

I can't wait to read the other books in this series if book one and two are this good I know the other books in the series are also awesome."}, {"userName": " Rosebud", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5556260-rosebud", "userReview": "Marrok Walker, an Apache werewolf Guardian, had been searching for his one true fated mate when he finally finds her in one Taylor Moore, a BBW human female. Coming to her rescue when she's about to be raped, he brings her to his home intending to complete their mating bond and live in HEA bliss. Plans come to a screeching halt when Taylor mysteriously disappears from his home. To add to the mystery there is no scent or physical evidence to aid in any type of search. Thirty One years later Marrok is just a shell of a man until two badly injured shapeshifters stumble into Wolf Town sharing tales about a lab where those of their kind are being experimented on, including Taylor. A rescue mission is launched with Taylor and the imprisoned shapeshifters liberated. The mysteries continue when it's found that Taylor hasn't aged in the 31 years she's been imprisoned.Little does the werewolf community realize that those behind Hell's Pit aren't ready to give up and that it's sociopath commander has taken a special interest in Taylor. The supernatural community will have to come together to locate and destroy those who run the experimental labs before more of their brethren fall victim to experimentation horrors.Excellent story line and plot premise. Werewolves, with ties to the Native American community, is an excellent analogy to parallel that both are protectors of Earth. Throwing in the evil element about a secretive entity who are looking to hurt the werewolves had implications that it would also be harming Earth imho. Good HAD to triumph or the future would be negatively impacted .....Unfortunately it was a case of good intent bad implementation. Between the time line errors and fine detail/world building that changed from one scene to another I had a hard time following the action adventure story line. If that wasn't enough the characters themselves had no clear personality. Rather, it seemed as if what they believed and how they acted changed from chapter to chapter. The best way I can describe my feeling on this is that their actions at the moment was what the ideal person would do or say in the circumstance instead of adapting their core traits to deal with any angst or internal struggles unique to that character.About 3/4 of the way through this story I had the opinion that this would be a 3 rating for me as I basically enjoyed the story as a whole .. until .. several over the top situations occurred that totally crossed into the 2.5 (more to the 2) range. The potential for spoiler information have me not being specific about this but I will throw out a few totally vague (hypothetical) thoughts. First. when money isn't an issue I would think that security and technology available would be the best on the market. Second, advanced life support, when used, has implications you can't negate. Third, microchips. There are a number of additional issues for me so don't think I'm being nit pickey. I do feel this series as a whole has a lot of potential and merit. I realize it's not my place to be a armchair quarterback but do feel that an experienced editor or even a crit partner/beta reader would result in a far superior end product."}, {"userName": "Lady", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8882553-lady", "userReview": "I received this book in exchange for an honest review (Lovers of Paranormal or LoP on Goodreads).Marrok Walker is a guardian with nothing to lose. Ever since he lost his mate thirty one years ago, he just existed now. Then one day, two wolves barely hanging on to their lives arrived in town and brings some good and bad news to them. Marrok finds out that his mate has been alive all this time and in the very state they met in. The bad news is what is happening at the place the wolves escaped from. Now that he knows that she is still alive there is no stopping him from getting to her.Taylor Moore, found herself at the wrong place at the wrong time. Taylor's best friend talked he into going out one night and that when things take a turn for her. She found herself at a lake in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of bikers.

So when she sees her chance she helps two wolves escape and she tells them where to go.

He comes across Taylor, who is stuck with some biker guys because he friend took a shine to one. Things begin to turn nasty but Marrok comes and saves the night. He scented his mate and he wasn't going to let her go. Taylor was taken from Marrok. He believes she is dead so he moves pack. Thirty one years later, two nearly dead wolves turn up saying that Taylor sent them to find Marrok. Nothing gets in this wolf's way to get his mate back.

This is the 2nd book in the Wolf Town Guardian series, but it can easily be a stand-alone read. All the books in the series follow a similar formula. They all keep a good pace. The characters are well developed and very entertaining. There is romance, plenty of action, mystery, drama and intrigue. In all the books, a Wolf-shifter Guardian finds his mate. The mates are all women with troubled backgrounds, low self esteem and have issues with being fuller figured. But through it all the mated couple find happiness and live happily ever after. I just wish that the language used during the \u201clove scenes\u201d was a little more romantic and loving, instead it feels to me like the dialog is straight out of a porn movie. I loved the steamy imagery, but the dialog made me cringe every time in all 4 of the books. In this book the story is about Marrok and his mate Taylor. This book has it all and is a fantastic, enjoyable book to read.

The story was much deeper and revolved around more than just the mated pair. In this book, Taylor and Marrok are our fated mates. I felt Taylor was a sweetheart that got dealt a really crappy hand, but focused on trying to save everyone else before herself. She's a very giving soul that desperately needs to be protected. Marrok is our hero, he's cool,calm and collected strapped with major guilt and lack of passion for life in the start of the book. Oh ya, he's also a hot native american motorcycle rider-yummy!! Of course, Caroline an Alexander play a huge role in this book as does some of the characters from the last book;). The plot line was great, it left me guessing as to what was going to happen next. I literally finished this book in a sitting, I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed the fact that these two didn't have a perfect relationship, they had to work for it. It seemed like a far deeper love than you usually get with PNR novels. I'd definitely recommend this to shifter,romance,action and all paranormal lovers.
