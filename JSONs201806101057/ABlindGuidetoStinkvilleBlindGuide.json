Yes, I found albinos too fascinating to think that they might actually exist.BUT NOW, I\u2019m quite familiar with the condition. Alice is an albino: she has white skin, white hair and blue, blue eyes. Also, she is blind. Well not exactly. She isn\u2019t 100% blind, but 90%, rather. Therefore, she depends on her parents, her brother and her dog to move from one place from another.However, as Alice learns to cope with moving to Sinkville and leaving her best friend behind, she discovers new things about her new town and new people worth building a relationship with that make her not miss her old house too much. Moreover, Alice learns to be more independent, understanding, compassionate and, ultimately, aware of the different between \u2018\u2018need\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018want.\u2019\u2019 I really have nothing negative to say about this book. It is indeed short, but that\u2019s not a problem in itself. It explores so many important topics and themes that I wish this had gotten more attention than this, because it deserves it. My only complain, if you can call it that, is how little humour it contained, because I pictured Alice as being a witty girl full of humorous thoughts, although maybe a bit sarcastic also, but it\u2019s more intense than humorous, to be honest, which makes absolute sense.I look extremely forward to the sequel/companion novel.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9947640-beth", "userReview": "Dear Reader, \tThere are two things in life I know for certain. \tOne: everyone has a story. \tTwo: everybody faces challenges. \tAbout that first thing. I want you to take a journey with me back to 1989. Picture a young girl with a bad perm. But it hasn\u2019t been re-permed in a long time, so the tops just hang down flat and the bottoms are wild tiny curls that can\u2019t be brushed. Well, they can. But they haven\u2019t been in a long time. This girl, she\u2019s average size, average height, above average foot size. She has a strange affection for black and electric green bike shorts. She loves to pair them with her lucky T-shirt, which is bright blue and pink. So here she is standing in front of you. Bad hair. Bad, mismatched clothes. Huge feet. Feet that are currently in dark leather penny loafers, even though it\u2019s 90 degrees outside and no one other than grandpas wear penny loafers. But they were on sale at the beginning of the year and Mom bought them big so they\u2019d fit for a long time. Now it\u2019s the end of the year, and they\u2019re the only shoes she has that fit so she wears them every day. Every single day. Even gym days, like today. Even though she doesn\u2019t wear socks. Even though everyone laughs at the squeaky way her feet move in the boat-sized shoes and the way the slippery bottoms send her sliding across the gym floor. But who cares, right? Because today\u2014right now\u2014she\u2019s in that gym class, and she\u2019s playing basketball. And guess what? Booyah! She just made a basket! Nothing but net, baby! It was like the other team just got out of her way, knowing they couldn\u2019t possibly beat her! . . . Oh. Wait a sec. They got out of her way because she made a basket for them. The wrong team. Yup. They get the point. And her team hates her. Now this girl, standing in front of you in her black and electric green bike shorts, her blue, threadbare T-shirt, her bad stringy hair, and her leather shoes has a face flaming red with embarrassment. Tomato red. Volcano red. You know what really sets off a blushing, sweaty face? Enormous blue plastic glasses. Can you picture her? Do you see her in front of you? Yep. That\u2019s ten-year-old me, just a year or two younger than Alice, whom you\u2019re about to meet in A Blind Guide to Stinkville. I\u2019m almost thirty-six years old now. A lot of things have happened to me since I was that kid. Some things were sad. Some were scary. And many, many wonderful and joyous experiences happened, too. But, let me tell you, even at thirty-six, I still think of my middle grade years as the darkest period of my life. And yet . . . I write children\u2019s books. Specifically, I write books for\u2014drum roll\u2014middle grade kids. Which means I spend most of every day reliving my own middle school years. Why would I put myself through remembering every excruciating moment of that time of life? Because I remember so clearly feeling like I just needed someone to hear me. That I had a lot to say but not a lot of people who would listen. Because this was the age where I had to decide\u2014do I want to fit in or stand out? (Believe me, this question alone can fuel many books!) \tNow, fast forward to me as a young, new mom. Picture me, standing in the middle of a bookstore, my hair pulled back in a ponytail. I\u2019m swaying slightly from foot to foot, as if I were rocking the baby that\u2019s actually sleeping in her stroller beside me. I\u2019m tired\u2014baby still isn\u2019t sleeping through the night, after all\u2014but you can tell I\u2019m also energized. I\u2019m practically vibrating, eyes scanning the rows of books. When I reach the bottom row, you notice that swaying stop. You see me scan the books again, this time with an outstretched finger touching each spine. You see me reach the last row and stop, a statue for a moment. Now you don\u2019t know much about being a parent, maybe, but you know what I do next is odd. Even you know you should never pluck a sleeping baby out of her stroller just to hold her close. You hear the outraged baby cry at this unnecessary cuddling. \tThis is about when I realized number two above: that everyone faces challenges. Sometimes, babies are even born with them. That baby of mine had just been diagnosed with a visual impairment. As it turns out, the doctors had been wrong; I\u2019d find out soon that she has only a mild version of what doctors told me she was facing. But in that moment we just witnessed, I didn\u2019t know that yet. I didn\u2019t know much of anything, but I was certain I\u2019d be fine\u2014we\u2019d be fine\u2014if I could just find a book to help me. A guide of some sort on being the mom of a visually impaired child. Only the challenge my baby was thought to be facing was so rare that no book existed for it in this huge bookstore. \tEverybody has a story. Everyone faces challenges. \tThose two moments converge in a lot of ways in A Blind Guide to Stinkville. While it turns out that my child\u2019s condition isn\u2019t as severe as what Alice has\u2014albinism and blindness\u2014I did spend a lot of time considering what our lives would be like if that were the case. \tAdd to that my own experiences as a middle schooler, navigating that path of fitting in versus standing out, and you\u2019ve got a lot of the inspiration behind Stinkville. So, you see, whether to fit in or stand out isn\u2019t a question at all for Alice. She\u2019s always going to stand out. It\u2019s just the nature of being blind and having albinism: other people notice. The trick for Alice, then, is to figure out how she sees herself. And that\u2019s something I wish I could go back and tell my loafer-wearing, bad-permed middle-school self: how you view yourself changes how others view you. I wish I could let her know that there are plenty of people who would have listened to what she had to say, if she would just open up a little. Let her know that she wasn\u2019t alone\u2014that everyone around her (yes, even the ones laughing at that mistaken basketball shot) faces challenges. Those challenges might not be as obvious as Alice\u2019s, but what I learned in fifth grade remains true: everyone has a story. And it\u2019s up to each of us to decide how our story is written. Everybody faces challenges. Everyone has a story. But your story is so much more than just your challenges. Maybe I\u2019d let Alice tell that new-mom me something, too: sometimes you have to write your own guide book when you\u2019re lost. Welcome to Stinkville, dear reader.

This was one of the best books I have read this year. The main character, Alice had so much spunk and heart it was hard not to like her. Alice has albinism and this follows her and her family as they move to a new town. Before the move everyone knew about Alice's condition, but now the fact that Alice has albinism and doesn't see well becomes something that needs to be explained to new people and talked about in her family. Lots of great discussion about what it means to have a disability and what it means to be successful. This story was endearing and and wonderful.

Durante toda tu vida de lector que espero nunca vayas a dejar de lado, encontrar\u00e1s libros malos, libros buenos, libros que por alguna raz\u00f3n solo a ti te gustan, libros que jam\u00e1s vas a mencionar haber le\u00eddo porque son solo para ti. Pero luego vas a encontrar libros como A Blind Guide to Stinkville que cuando lo termines, sonreir\u00e1s como si hubieras encontrado esa pieza que le faltaba a tu vida.THAT GUACAMOLEYa hab\u00eda tenido oportunidad de leer a Beth Vrabel con anterioridad, su libro debut A Pack of Dorks fue uno de los culpables que me enamorar\u00e1 del Middle Grade. Pens\u00e9 que su siguiente libro ser\u00eda la continuaci\u00f3n de ese, pero hace unos d\u00edas la escritora tuite\u00f3 un link para preordenar su libro. Decir que casi me rompo la mano buscando si el libro estaba para rese\u00f1ar, ser\u00eda mentir. Y, al igual que Alice, no sab\u00eda que el libro me afectar\u00eda de esa manera.Como siempre, fui sin saber de qu\u00e9 iba la historia, y lo que me encontr\u00e9 fue una de las historias m\u00e1s importantes para m\u00ed en lo que va del a\u00f1o. Para empezar es la primera vez que leo sobre albinismo, ni en mis m\u00e1s ambiciosos sue\u00f1os hubiera esperado toparme con libro como este. Alice es un personaje que te va a enamorar desde el primer instante que la conoces y si no es as\u00ed \u00a1Qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 mal contigo! Me he conmovido tanto con su manera de narrar, me ha enamorado su personalidad. Cuando digo conmovido no me refiero que me hizo llorar cada cinco segundos, porque no, Alice es un personaje con discapacidad que no te hace sentirte mal por ella, s\u00ed, su ceguera es el tema central, pero A Blind Guide to Stinkville es sobre ella prob\u00e1ndose a s\u00ed misma y demostr\u00e1ndole a los dem\u00e1s que su discapacidad no la define (tal y como dice la sinopsis).THAT GUACAMOLEEn una historia tan interesante como la que nos cuenta Alice, podr\u00eda decirse que Beth Vrabel lo ten\u00eda todo, solo que la escritora dio mucho m\u00e1s.La escritora hizo un gran trabajo con un personaje y su depresi\u00f3n, no lo dulcific\u00f3, no lo hizo como si todos lo entendieran, fue realista. Sobre todo en como afecta a las personas a su alrededor, siendo qui\u00e9n es el personaje con depresi\u00f3n, para m\u00ed, una persona que tiene que vivir diariamente con esto, fue, en una manera demasiado personal, esperanzador.Y NO ME HAGAS EMPEZAR CON LOS DEM\u00c1S PERSONAJESBeth Vrabel entr\u00f3 autom\u00e1ticamente en mi lista de escritores favoritos, en este libro ella te habla sobre discapacidad, depresi\u00f3n, dislexia, racismo, segundas oportunidades, familia, mascotas, nuevos comienzos, todo eso a trav\u00e9s de Alice y todas las maravillosas personas que conoce en esta ciudad que huele un poco mal.

Her father is busy, her mother is depressed, and she needs a ton of sunscreen. It also doesn't help that \"back home\" everyone knew that Alice had vision difficulties because of her alibinism, and in the new town, she finds herself constantly having to explain. She meets Kerica at the town library and is glad to have a new friend, especially since her old best friend is moving on with her life. Alice is less thrilled with Sandi, who also spends a lot of time in the library. Alice has a lot of trouble navigating the new town by herself, and her brother James has found other places to be, so Alice takes her dog, Tooter, many places with her, pretending he is her guide dog. There is a town writing contest about success stories in the town, and Alice manages to find a lot of them while trying to find her place in the town. She's particularly fond of elderly whittler Mr. Hamlin and gets to know diner owner Gretel and learns about the town's involvement in the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s from Mayor Hank. Alice also tries to help her mother, a former photojournalist, snap out of her depression by showing her the town that Alice is coming to enjoy. There are further complications involving Tooter's health and Alice's school placement, but in the end, things turn out fairly well. Strengths: This was a hopeful book about a middle grade student managing her diverse abilities with a small but devoted support system. Alice feels sorry for herself sometimes, like all middle grade students do, but also wants to show her parents how she can take care of herself. The community is vibrantly drawn and the setting adds a lot to the story. Despite the sad parts, I enjoyed this. Weaknesses: A lawsuit, dog health problems AND a mental health breakdown for the mother? That's a lot to address in one book, although the length is still very manageable. What I really think: I think I will buy this one. It addresses sight impairment from an interesting angle, and will appeal to readers who like realistic fiction or problem novels. I wanted to slap the mother, but that's a personal objection. Thought this captured middle grade sentiment much better than this author's Pack of Dorks."}, {"userName": "John Clark", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3537117-john-clark", "userReview": "At twelve, getting uprooted and moving almost all the way across the country would be traumatic. For Alice, the experience is far worse. In Seattle, everyone knew her around the neighborhood and at school, she was liked and others knew how to accept her difference. Alice has albinism and is almost completely blind.\tWhen her dad takes a job managing the tottering paper mill that gives Sinkville, SC its nickname of Stinkville, she's left feeling lost. Her best friend, Eliza seems to have moved on quickly back in Seattle, her father is spending more and more time at work, her older brother is angry about the move and resents having to be around Alice, but worst of all is her mother's reaction to the change. She's fallen into a depression and barely gets out of bed.\tAt first, Alice has a sense of panic, but after discovering the local library, she begins to suck it up and realize that if she's going to learn how to survive in her new environment, she'll need to do it on her own. After making friends with Kerica, daughter of the childrens librarian and being snubbed by Sandi, another girl who frequents the library, but for reasons she'd prefer to keep secret, Alice sets on a new path with her dog Tooter, so named because of his habit of flatulence. That road brings her confidence, more new friends and insight into her own family, but most importantly, it helps her discover that sense of community she so sorely missed after leaving Seattle. How these come about make for a really feel-good experience.

You see Alice has albinism which is a condition where your body produces no pigment and as a result you are pale, have white hair and often times have eye problems. Alice can\u2019t see very well and legally is classified as blind. Alice and her family have just moved across the country for her father\u2019s job.

Humorous and light, Vrabel shows us the raw truth of how people who are perceived as different are treated and how it effects them without skimming over the details and being unnecessarily wallowing.\nCHARACTERS\nAll the characters are strong and brilliant on their own. Each character has something they're fighting with, and they're effected in many different ways. Vrabel shows us different sides of life by giving us real, raw consequences and effects. She also gives us hope that we can get through tough times, we can fight back against stereotypes, and we can be happy with who and what we are no matter what. Vrabel balances all these tough topics and meshes them into one honest and brilliant lighthearted tale that stays with you long after you've finished reading it.Alice\u00a0is partially blind due to her albinism. All her life she has been surrounded by family and friends, people who know and don't question her condition. But when her family moves to Stinkville, everything changes. Her family members and everyone else don't think she can do anything on her own: walk to the library, join the Stinkville writing contest, write her entry herself, ect.\u00a0In an attempt to prove everyone wrong, she gets out of her comfort zone and stops depending on everyone. She stands up for herself, learns things, discoveries new lessons and perspectives, and she finds friendships in unlikely places. She is a very likeable, confident character and I loved her bluntness!Kerica is definitely a character I enjoyed reading about, even if we didn't see her much. She helped Alice out and showed her new places and taught her a few lessons, though she probably didn't realize it.\nWRITING\nThis is a quick read because of how the flow and the pace work. It's easy to get lost in the story and adore every moment of it, while also taking the time to admire the deep quotes or discoveries that have a deeper meaning than they \u00a0appear. I will admit however, that I would've liked to see more of the depression and how that's dealt with since it involves Alice and certain decisions.\nOVERALL\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This is a heartening read full of\u00a0hope and acceptance, even when things seem so helpless and lonely. In a fight with depression, blindness, dyslexia, albinism, and much more, Vrabel shows you how words and actions can hurt, and how they can also heal.*Review originally posted here*A huge thanks to the publisher for providing me with a free copy in exchange for an honest review.:)"}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7426892-angela", "userReview": "I\u2019m not exactly a YA reader. I like realistic fiction with protagonists my own age \u2013 I can just relate better, you know? But A Blind Guide to Stinkville reeled me in. I was laughing in Chapter One. I was invested by Chapter Three. I was bawling my eyes out in Chapter Seventeen... but that\u2019s for later in this review. Alice moves across the country and, like the rest of her family, is having a hard time adjusting. Besides the friend factor and the school factor, Alice has some physical challenges that were much easier to handle when everyone in her old town had known her since she was born. In Stinkville, Alice has to learn how to do things without the predictable help of those around her. I am SO IMPRESSED with Vrabel\u2019s consistent pace and even-keeled writing. Alice could be barely holding it together, or the girl in the library could have just revealed something astonishing, or a new friend could be just as mean as the old friend just was\u2026 and Vrabel writes it all very matter-of-factly, like none of these things are the end of the world. No melodrama, here. No way. And that\u2019s totally refreshing in a world of melodramatic teenagers and melodramatic teenage books. I know that when my children read Stinkville, they will accept the characters and their idiosyncrasies without batting an eyelash. They will understand that differences are No Big Deal. And maybe they\u2019ll realize that all the things they\u2019ve been practically fainting about in their real lives are also No Big Deal, because, hey, Alice got through much more challenging circumstances with far less indignity. I am also excited for my children to read Stinkville so they might be eager to be more independent, be inspired to find their way around their town (literally and figuratively), and be able to navigate new situations with grace and purpose. So, Chapter Seventeen. Well, I had just taken a break after reading the first sixteen chapters, and I was ready to settle in for two wonderful last chapters \u2013 my favorite chapters in any book. Beth Vrabel threw me for a loop and wrote something so funny and so heartbreaking that I choked out a laugh and then proceeded to cry my head off. I cried and laughed until I finished the book. I\u2019m a mom, and I get emotional when I read about children struggling \u2013 or in this case, overcoming their struggles so well that my heart fills up. Everything in A Blind Guide to Stinkville seems so real that I want to say You Can\u2019t Make Up This Stuff. But Vrabel did. She put her imagination together with her experiences to create something so wonderful that I need to read it again. Oh, and that Blind Guide that Alice wrote?

Young Alice was born with albinism and is almost completely blind. Her family moves to Sinkville, South Carolina where she is new and has trouble with telling people she is blind. She ends up making friends at the library and even wins a writing contest! This book is written from Alice, the main character\u2019s, point of view and the setting is Sinkville, South Carolina. Alice changes throughout the story by a big leap in her maturity and in her skills in making friends and in herself as a person. Alice was a one friend girl with no area to expand in herself and really acted as though if she was younger than she is now. Through an indirect characterization of actions, Alice seems kind and sweet. When Mr.Hamlin told Alice about his sunken house, she had a reaction of kindness and showing she was thoughtful. After the story, \u201cThis time I was surprised to find myself crying. I scooted over and put my hand on Mr.Hamlin\u2019s shoulder.\u201d This shows kindness because even though Alice barely knew Mr.Hamlin, she still cared for him as if he was her brother or best friend. She is also strong and stands up for what she believes in. When Anthony Hamlin was the families lawyer Alice had turned him down because he knew the offer that Mr.Hamlin gave him if he were to do this for Alice\u2019s family. She had said, \u201cI know the favor Mr.Hamlin- the older Mr.Hamlin- had to make. He agreed to let you sell the farmland. He\u2019s going to let you put him in an old folks home. I can\u2019t let you do that. He needs that land for Sarah. He needs the wood and the whittling and the sunset and no creamed carrots! We don\u2019t accept.\u201d This shows that Alice is strong because even though she knows that this man could take the sue off of her parents, she will not let him do it because she is standing up for what she believes is right. The second main character is Tooter, Alice\u2019s dog. Tooter is an odd dog who is loving, caring and hilarious to the family. Tooter is always doing something gross like pulling his butt across the floor or farting as in his name. Although all of this is true, Tooter is the glue that holds his family together, and helped Alice as a seeing eye dog although he really is not a good one. The third main character is Kerica, Alice's friend from the library. Kerica is forgiving, nice and always helps Alice no matter what. She is also very supporting and was Alice's first friend when she came to Sinkville. The main problem in this story is that Alice has to cope with a new environment and she has to deal with everyone knowing that she is blind. This is a character vs self conflict and it is mostly internal and only some external when she deals with her problem on the outside. Alice has to deal with her problems mostly by herself but with occasional help from her mom and mostly from meeting Kerica. The theme of this story is to never let any of your problems get in your way as there is always a way to get through them. Alice is mostly blind and is albino so she has to deal with people looking at her funny and with not being able to see. But she does not let that get in her way. She still does not let that get in her way and lives the first part of her life to the fullest. The tone of the author changes very fast and frequently through the story. From emotions to fun and happiness, there is a wide variety of tone with this book. The mood was usually happy and sometimes emotional but you usually feel sympathetic and happy for Alice and it almost never changes. The author's word choice and writing style were exquisite and always seemed to make me want to keep reading the novel as there was almost never a dull moment. The author did very well on their writing elements and made sure to keep the reader excited and eager to find out what's next. Beth Vrabel is a wonderful writer ana always picks the right words to write and describe the story and what is happening. The only critique I would give is to maybe use less characters that are not as important in the story. I would recommend this book to someone who knows the feeling to move to a new town and not know anyone. Also to someone who can easily feel sympathy and gets caught up in exciting and heartwarming books."}, {"userName": "Perry Yung", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71887550-perry-yung", "userReview": "In the novel, \u201cA Blind Guide to Stinkville\u201d By Beth Vrabel, the author tries to express and explain here life as a teenage girl with the passages she has crossed. Though this is not an autobiography it is an improvised version of Beth Vrabel\u2019s life in a paper town. This novel is fictional due to some events in the story seeming unnatural and not how many would experience living in the paper town. The main character, Alice was described as a girl with albinism who tries to make her way through her new life crossing paths with enemies but making new friends. Life in Stinkville wasn\u2019t the same for Alice as it was back at Seattle, her old hometown, it had a strange vibe to it with the paper factories leaving a stench that was unbearable for newcomers. As Alice\u2019s family tries to adjust to moving to the new town they are having a hard time communicating with others and exploring their new home. Due to this Alice decides to head to the Stinkville library where she meets a friend. This girl seems to be a bookworms but is nice to Alice because she is the newcomer of the town. But as the girl looks around the library she spots Alice\u2019s dog, Tooter. The girl is later known as Kerica and knows that dogs are not allowed in public facilities, before realizing that Alice has albinism, Kerica questions Alice with some rude remarks. As the questions die out Kerica leads Alice to one of the other girls who stays at the library most of the time, Sandi. After meeting and exploring with her new friends, Alice FaceTimes her old friend from Seattle. After finally getting ahold of Eliza, her old friend, Alice had noticed change in her old friend who had been with her for many year. She noticed her wall had been painted a dark blue color that represented a gothic version of Eliza. This was not normal and Eliza offended Alice so the only thing that Alice could resolve to was hanging up the Facetime because it was awkward. As the novel goes on after this incident Alice is now insecure and has a secret that she has not told her parents. She had not wanted to put her family in her situation and get into stopping Eliza for making her own choices because her family was not well adjusted with a depressed mother and a brother who didn\u2019t enjoy living in the town. After many visits to the library they had announced the first annual Stinkville History Writing Competition where one student of Stinkville\u2019s school wrote a success story about Stinkville and the events that occured years ago. Alice was confident when entering the contest thinking she had a chance of winning the grand prize. But as the competition goes on Kerica is not in a good mood due to her experiences with helping others and not achieving the earned respect after all of her work. Her attitude had changed after learning that her mother knew her competitive thought. This character vs character conflict did not last long after Kerica felt bad for what she had done and apologized for the mean words and remarks she gave to Alice. Kerica was a big move in Alice\u2019s growth as a better person, making Alice more apologetic and polite. The theme of this story is friendship and kindness. This is because even though Alice was fighting with both of her new friends she made the most out of it and tried to make a nice adjustment waiting for the pending apology given to her by Kerica and Sandi. Though they didn\u2019t apologize as quick as Alice had hoped, nonetheless Alice decided to help Sandi with her book report due to the disease, dyslexia making Sandi unable to write her report. This was an excellent idea at the time after Sandi and her mom had been suing Alice\u2019s family after the family dog, Tooter had \u201cassaulted\u201d Sandi by being on her. When Elizabeth McAllister, Sandi\u2019s mom figured out of the kind act she decided to drop all charges on the family and make them live normally in Stinkville once again. As the novel trails on the reader soon learns a true cliffhanger to the novel. As the news broke that all charges had been dropped Kerica had notified Alice that Tooter may have a life threatening brain tumor, with no cure. Alice finds this information hard to believe but as she steps home, her mother seems sad, but not depressed sad, so Alice exclaims, \u201cIt\u2019s a brain tumor isn\u2019t it\u201d and her mom nods her head with her hugging gesture. I believe the author did an amazing job writing this novel with brief details on her life events and other amazing thrilling events that not many have heard of. There is also many controversies and drama that goes on through the story making the readers want to carry on with the novel like I did. The saddest part in this novel was when the funniest character in the story, Tooter, had a brain tumor and risked death. I didn\u2019t like how after all the joyful events the author chose to end the novel in a sad, dramatic way. Most of the chapters the author had jumped around settings not really having a trail of how the characters had achieved that destination.My recommendation is to have those who dislike sad stories back away from \u201cA Blind Guide to Stinkville\u201d due to the sad ending event and some of the other parts of this novel. Some of those who choose to read drama related novels would truly enjoy this one. Although there is lots of drama this novel is also a thrill to read after having many rising actions and conflicts."}, {"userName": "Theresa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4752902-theresa", "userReview": "Before Stinkville, Alice didn\u2019t think albinism\u2014or the blindness that goes with it\u2014was a big deal.

Once I got into this book, though, I couldn't put it down. It's no wonder they put it on the Louisiana Young Reader's Choice list for 2017.The main character has just moved into a new town, Sinkville, SC. Because of the Paper Mill in town that her dad now runs, the town stinks, hence the name \"Stinkville.\" Not only is she new to town, but she's also suffers from albinism. She's legally blind and has to stay out of direct sunlight. This was something that everyone just accepted in Seattle, but this new town is full of new challenges.With a contest for young journalists in town, Alice makes new friends and learns more about what makes her new city great. She also learns more about herself as she pushes her own boundaries and steps way out of her comfort zone.I love this book. It's not your typical \"new kid in town\" story. It gets down and dirty and tells the story of a girl that has a exceptional situation that she deals with.

Nobody in town knows her, and she doesn't know her way around. People think of her as blind Alice instead of seeing her for who she really is. This book deals with some very real issues. Some books that deal with blindness, depression or dyslexia make the issues the only focus and forget all about the characters. This is not one of those books; the characters in this book are nuanced and realistic. I also learned a lot about albinism from this book, but there is nothing preachy in this book.

The main character has spent her whole life in a small town where everyone knew she was blind, she went to a regular school and her mother took her everywhere she needed to go. Then, her dad gets a new job and they move to Stinkville (really called Sinkville, but it smells really bad due to the paper mill). Her mother becomes depressed and for the first time she realizes her limitations being blind causing her to start figuring things out for herself. The author really does a great job of explaining her mother's depression and how it affects the family.

With her father working constantly, her mother sunken in what looks like an impenetrable depression, and her 15 year old brother angry, Alice - who is legally blind - has to fall back on her own initiative to get to know her new home. Spending time in the library she makes steps towards what may be a new best friend, and makes an accidental enemy. Students will admire Alice's pluck, and root for Alice and her dog Tooter.

The town stinks, literally. Her father busy at work and never home, her mom is well...not really acting like her mom, and her brother has become sulky and angry. At home, Seattle that is, everyone knew Alice. They accepted her. Her albinism and near blindness wasn't a factor. Now, she couldn't get around with help and had to explain herself to people. It just wasn't the same. But she certainly isn't ready to go to a special blind school! Vrabel hooked me into her story by not focusing on Alice's disability, but on Alice's strength of character.
