What I want to know is, where is my prize? This is definitely a book that needs to come with a merit certificate at the finish line. A purportedly stream of consciousness serving as Virgil\u2019s swan song in Brundisium, it is a tax on consciousness and a stream of strum. Which apparently reads as a poem in German, and a labour of, well, labour in English.As is my wont, I approached with no background ammo: let the text speak, hear, hear. Right at the beginning I floundered: an adulatory personality cult muchadumbre in Brindisium, gathered to the accolade of emperor Augustus, Virgil\u2019s patron, is described as a sea of evil. In depth, and existentially. It jarred. Of all the descriptors, ever, I\u2019ve come across to paint a picture of a crowd, evil seems such an incongruous word. Evil is a conscious choice whereas crowds have no consciousness. And I\u2019m just not sure the concept as such applies to Rome. Quick look up: and yes. Broch wrote DOV whilst incarcerated by the Nazis and suffering terrible deprivations. So. Herein lies the greatest problem with this tome. Throughout, Broch applies Judeo-Christian etymology and imagery in an ancient Greco-Roman setting. Effectively, he rewrites Virgil through the kaleidoscope of 20c mantra. At first cautiously (introducing themes of rebirth and existential extrapolations on time and being lifted directly from Heidegger), and finally abandoning all subtlety and throwing in the Messianic birth to a Virgin and the ensuing holy trinity as a prophecy, 20 years before the birth of Christ and on page 266. Like I said: jarrrrrrrr. I don\u2019t know why he bothers with Virgil at all: he is certainly not interested in extrapolating Roman philosophy, his efforts of portraying Roman society are inaccurate and foolhardy, and given his modus operandi: inner monologue broken by a 100 page discussion between Virgil and Augustus, why not just do what Pessoa did and dispense with unnecessary plot and just pen those essays on Being away. Or heck, just develop that monologue dialog theme a la Ayn Rand (although Broch would claim he was emulating Plato\u2019s Republic. He is). And, yes, I\u2019m aware Virgil is credited with predicting the birth of the Messiah.But lets not quibble. OK, so Virgil is a randomly chosen vehicle for existential angst. So, what have we got? Well, holy shmoly. What haven\u2019t we got, all gurgled forth in a Thomas Bernhardian repetitious hypnosis. But so. At the top of the pyramid I put sfumato. Equally opposing forces drawn kicking and screaming into an unholy unity. Unity of opposites is the end goal Broch pursues, and unholy it is because the atoms just don\u2019t bond. Or rather, Broch fails to sew it all up together. First he bombards us with Socrates\u2019 doctrine of recollection, whose essence is etched in every permutation of Virgil\u2019s vigil, because, I suspect, that is the only way Broch can encounter infinity. Then, he introduces \u2018love\u2019 as the antidote of evil and the meaning of life, and also at the same time as the Jesus prophecy. The kind of Sunday school Christian love is what we\u2019re talking about. And subsequently, here comes Plotia. Now, an aside. Virgil seems, by all counts, to have been a homosexual individual. He allegedly had an affinity to a woman called Plotia, but refused carnal relations with her. And he also worshiped his mother. But Broch wades in, Wellington boots high, and \u2018redeems\u2019 Virgil through a \u2018Platonic\u2019 love fest with Plotia (but remember all is inner monologue), at his deathbed. I say Platonic because Broch says it. Can he possibly not know what platonic love is? Tsk. Now, I do find the fleshless union with Plotia, along with part 4, the Homecoming, to be the most lyrical and magical renditions in the book, but still. I\u2019m a big girl now, I don\u2019t need homosexuality glossed over. And neither does Virgil: he\u2019d prolly turn in his grave if he could read this version of his salvation. Phew. So finally, why doth one need a prize for ploughing through this black lava flow of a narrative? Well, here is an example of what is in store for the stalwart who embark:\u2018The image of his ship was his own image emerging from darkness, heading towards darkness sinking into darkness, he himself was the boundless ship that at the same time was boundlessness, and he himself was was the flight that was aiming toward the boundlessness; he was the fleeing ship, he himself the goal, he himself was boundlessness too vast to be seen, an endless boundlessness of darkness\u2018And that is how the whole book reads. No wonder it defeats many, many readers. Of course, what with me being older and wiser, I know exactly how to handle this type of situation. First, I mix 150 ml of Tia Maria with 50 ml of Kahlua and a thimbleful of Baileys. Next I add a splash of Stoli and a sprinkle of Drambui. Well, a thumb full. Ok. Half a cup. Then, I re-read the above, and I\u2019m like, \u2018what! Thats it? No way. What just happened. Surely he was also the boundlessness aiming towards the flight!\u2019I\u2019m just going to say one thing in parting. Not a good thing to have two cocktails at once. I did, at one point, and had to suspend all existential diarrhoea in favour of Wodehouse\u2019s Summer Moonshine till it wore off."}, {"userName": "Evripidis Gousiaris", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43040512-evripidis-gousiaris", "userReview": "\u038c\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03cc \u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf, \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03a0\u038f\u03a3 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc! \u0391\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c0\u03c9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf, \u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03be\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1. \u0391\u03bd \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 \u03c3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c8\u03b7. \u038c\u03bb\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03af \u03c4\u03bf \u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf \u03cd\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1. \u0391\u03bd \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ae \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5...(\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c8\u03b1.) \u03a6\u03bf\u03b2\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03c9 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9. \u0388\u03c7\u03c9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c9 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u0391\u03a1\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u038e\u03a1\u0393\u0397\u039c\u0391. \u0391\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2 Orbis Literae!"}, {"userName": "David Lentz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3604115-david-lentz", "userReview": "This novel reads more like an epic poem than a novel, which is only right as the novel deals with the demise of the Aeneid's brilliant author. A sensitive and patient reader will be generously rewarded by the sheer poetry of the rich and meaningful language written by a first-rate, unheralded genius in Hermann Broch. One sees many shades of Aeneas in this tale about Virgil's trip to visit Caesar to present him the Aeneid. There is much in this tale about the challenges of writers to capture the true essence of life and the torment by Virgil about his inability to truly capture it in the Aeneid. Virgil is so tormented by the inadequacies he finds in his masterpiece that he threatens to burn the Aeneid but is forbidden by Augustus to do so. If it were not for Nora Barnacle, wife of James Joyce, much of that work of genius would have been lost to a fire from which in a bit of quick witted work she managed to retrieve it. Broch presents the rich, dense, intellectual sensibilities of Virgil with a style that will challenge and immensely satisfy readers of gorgeous literary novels. The innovative, prose style of Broch reminded me of Proust with some of the longest and most beautiful sentences that I have ever read. As beautifully as this book is written, the translation by Jean Starr Untermeyer utterly blew me away -- this is a highly nuanced and complex novel about poetic sensibilities which dive deep into the abyss and float high into the \"second immensity\" of the \"cupola of the stars\". Untermeyer provides full poetic justice in her translation to richly bring to life in English a truly memorable work and one of life's greatest literary treasures. Broch's novel ranks near the very top of the world's most masterfully articulated, literary novels and is truly worthy of the high critical acclaim it has received on this site by extremely bright readers. Seize the day: this novel is truly one of a kind --like the Aeneid, which so deeply inspired Broch, this novel is one for the ages."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/531153-jonathan", "userReview": "\u201cThe philosophical content (of The Death of Virgil) itself resembles a Spinozistic Cosmos- and Logos-speculation in which all things we know to be separate and particular appear as the ever changing aspects of an eternal One, so that the manifold is understood as the merely temporary individualization of the all-comprehensive whole.\u201d  - Hannah Arendt \u201cThe Death of Virgil, one of the major works of our age, attempts to vitalize language with the contrapuntal logic and dynamic simultaneities of music. More radically than Joyce, it subverts the time-structure and linear progressions on which prose fiction is normally built. Broch\u2019s style has an uncanny spell, because tangential to it are intimations of entirely different codes of statement, such as the use of silence\u2026, or the projection into language of the grammar of mathematics. Contemporary writing has scarcely begun to avail itself of Broch\u2019s instigations.\u201d  George SteinerI have read this book three or four times now and, in preparation for writing this, I opened the first page and almost got sucked straight back in: \u201cSteel-blue and light, ruffled by a soft, scarcely perceptible cross-wind, the waves of the Adriatic streamed against the imperial squadron as it steered toward the harbor of Brundisium, the flat hills of the Calabrian coast coming gradually nearer on the left...Of the seven high-built vessels that followed one another, keels in line, only the first and last, both slender rams-prowed pentaremes, belonged to the war-fleet; the remaining five, heavier and more imposing, deccareme and duodeccareme, were of an ornate structure in keeping with the Augustan imperial rank, and the middle one, the most sumptuous, its bronze mounted bow gilded, gilded the ring-bearing lion's head under the railing, the rigging wound with colors, bore under purple sails, the festive and grand, the tent of Caesar. Yet on the ship that immediately followed was the poet of the Aeneid and death's signet was graved upon his brow.\u201d Though of course I know that this entrance to the text is a deceptive one, that we move swiftly to the internal, the eternal and the metaphysical, and never again will we be so firmly and clearly situated. It is strange that I should love this book so much, filled as it is with occasionally laughable (almost New-Agey) philosophy, often more in love with the sound of its own saying than with any sense, or any real concern with some sort of \u201ctruth\u201d. I have a very low tolerance for such writing and, when I come across things like this, divorced from their context, I wonder how I can have got through the novel once, let alone four times:\u201d Plotia\u2019s nakedness was likewise unremarkable, for without this detracting from her bodily charm, he was scarcely able to see her any more as a woman, he saw her as it were from within, and beheld from the core of her individual essence, she was scarcely any longer a body but rather a transparent intrinsic substance, no longer a woman, no longer a virgin, but rather a smile, the smile which gives meaning to everything human, the human countenance opening in a smile, freed of shame, and exalted through a forlorn preparation incapable of consummation, sublimated to a transported-transporting love; strangely touching, strangely wintry, was this smiling, loving gesture toward the star swimming there in cool, virginal light, and strangely cool, aye, almost childish in its virginal, sex-stripped lucidity was this yearning gesture sent up to the utter clarity of the remotest spheres\u201dStuff like that makes my hackles rise, and I am filled with an urge to slap someone repeatedly round the face.Any yet, as much as this novel fails (and it could never succeed) there is something within in, something that occurs during the process of reading, during the, yes, symphonic nature of the text and the concepts contained therein \u2013 it is almost as though, on their own, each idea is meaningless, yet somehow, when woven together, they can gesture towards something fundamental, and fundamentally inexpressible.One additional pleasure to be found in the text is its beauty on a purely musical level. Reading this novel is like being floated gently downstream, submerged in warm and fragrant water. I would therefore suggest reading it relatively quickly, and not lingering on each individual pronouncement of profundity. Just go with it, Man. Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream\u2026.(I jest, of course, but only in part)."}, {"userName": "David M", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43332343-david-m", "userReview": "'The old is dying, the new cannot be born' - GramsciBurn the Aeneid.As a friend and I were just discussing, Broch's masterpiece seems especially poignant and relevant today. World historically speaking, probably a good time to get right with one's creator.As another friend told me, Reading is mostly vanity. Choose the good.*A lot of people claim this book is boring or extremely difficult. While I don't mean to dispute other people's incorrigible mental states, I must submit my own testimony. For me reading Death of Virgil was a downright ecstatic experience. I finished it in just a few days, practically in a trance. I had an extremely beat-up copy from a used bookstore which nearly turned to dust as I turned the pages. This seemed appropriate, as the subject is at once immortality and evanescence; the power of love and the vanity of human creation.

This sprawling masterpiece of streaming transcendence is one of the more breathtaking interpretations of that divine explosion; one in which the wick ignited by a soul gifted with deep perception winds it\u2019s way through life before being incinerated at the door of death\u2019s bomb. Broch is a master of Zen paradox; throughout the novel he attempts to dissociate his readers from context by turning basic concepts into intangible contradictions. While reading this one gets the sense that there is no purpose in life, that we are just along for the ride, while natural laws and theoretical ideas are only toys we use for exercising the gifts of reason and story. Unfortunately he doesn\u2019t depart from this formula at all, so the book risks the distinction of being one of the most redundant, repetitious, and inherently boring one to readers who don\u2019t appreciate philosophical conundrums.The pulse of the novel is a metafictional one; the ancient Roman writer Virgil is faced with the decision of burning The Aeneid before his death. Most of this takes place in the second half: the first half is an overwhelming barrage of apprehension in modernist prose. The first two sections are incredibly consistent, religiously intense, and before beginning the third section I was predicting that this would be in my top 5 reads of all time. Metafiction is somewhat of a bore to me, so the third section had me skipping ahead a few times.

Among other people, I recommend this book for writers with angst. His work has been insincere, his eye for beauty has led him astray, he has been no help to the real human world. He wants to start again but it's too late for that...I've learnt that the German and this English translation were published simultaneously, and Broch worked closely with Untermeyer. I found the English words amazingly chosen for sound and sense. Or where sense escapes us, yet for sound: there is great artistry in the translation.For the rest, see my updates. They were spontaneous (that\u2019s the use of these status updates).Believe me or not, although I\u2019ve read this book in bits and pieces over a year, I can\u2019t wait to start on the second read. Maybe I got about a half of it the first time. Note to self: I don\u2019t expect I\u2019ll have the brains to peruse this book in the week of my death. But read the last part. It\u2019s only forty pages, it\u2019s less difficult than part two can be; and it talks of death in a way an atheist like me who yet is an optimist by temperament, finds meaningful. It\u2019s Virgil\u2019s inside experience \u2013 of a voyage, that cannot help but remind me of the Grey Havens and Frodo\u2019s departure by ship. In mood, moreover \u2013 except that we\u2019re not the ones left on the shore (because of course I cry at the Grey Havens. But not here). The farewell voyage goes on into an experience of the animism of the cosmos. Schooled by this I think I can face the extinguishment of self, which I\u2019ve never been known to say before, self-centred as I am. He understands: Where, however, was his own face in this universe?Is there a Christian presence? Yes, because such is a part of Virgil\u2019s legend. As a non-Christian, I can read those allusions as historical, and \u2018the word\u2019 as an answer to, or last thoughts on, his poet\u2019s obsessions and dissatisfactions. Virgil felt on the verge of \u2013 what? A new artistic expression, or a salvation through human service? The medievals took him for a herald of Christianity, I believe on the strength of a prophecy of Augustus. There\u2019s enough irony there for this politically-aware novel to use: the writing was begun in a concentration camp and the Nazis were a shadowy presence in part one. Still in this novel, perhaps, if you\u2019re Christian you can see Christianity and if you don\u2019t want to you don\u2019t have to. Negatives: the conversations on aesthetics, though to be fair Virgil, at his last gasp, finds these fatuous too; and the philosophical poems, which I skimmed or skipped since I cannot do poetry about abstractions. If you\u2019re curious about this book but daunted, I think you can try out the fourth part on its own, or ahead. It\u2019s of great beauty (look, that\u2019s an understatement, and the translation must be a miracle) and there are no spoilers.

Our emotionally wounded narrator has just realized that a convalescing woman he sees hobble down the village promenade each morning in a small Spanish town where he is holed up reminds him of his high school civics teacher in the former GDR:Fraulein Kubic rocked her rounded body back and forth just like that, although she didn\u2019t wear a plaster walking cast. Her curly hair stood out from her head in just that way. She chanted in just the same soporific tone of complaint as she walked--slowly, slowly--between our rows of desks, announcing the basic laws of the dialectical method--making the pauses between the words long enough for you to fall asleep as she asked the fundamental philosophical question for the hundredth time...Can. Pause. The world. Pause. Be. Pause. Perceived?And wasn\u2019t she right, I think, as the imitation Fraulein Kubick totters past me, isn\u2019t that really the fundamental question?Which is precisely the question that Virgil wrestles with at the center of Broch\u2019s book. Virgil claims, as he asks his friends and then Augustus, to let him destroy the Aeneid because it is all surface; he has not succeeded in perceiving reality. I personally think the problem with the Aeneid is that it was written as flattery, since for me is is a deadly flat poem compared to other epics. (It only struck me after writing that that \u2018flat' starts \u2018flattery\u2019.) And perhaps Broch agrees, because although Virgil\u2019s spoken and interior arguments are about reality, it is the odious flattery in his every word to Augustus that make the most potent impression.The Met opera also resonated with The Death..., as it explores idealized love versus the reality of knowing the humanity, good and bad, of the loved one. Virgil claims to have finally realized that love is the highest value, but it still seems he means idealized love in the amorous sense, while he accepts the faults of his friends. One can\u2019t possible address all the things Broch tries to tackle in a GR review, but I will note I have to agree with the artistic failure (for me) of the strange Christian presentiments scattered throughout.I did try to take the advice to just read Broch and let the words wash over me, rather than trying to figure out what the heck he\u2019s saying. In some cases the language is beautiful:These were the moments of resounding deathlessness, the moments of essential life emerged from its twilight, and it was in these moments that the true form of death revealed itself most clearly: rare moments of grace, rare moments of perfect freedom, unknown to most, striven for my many, achieved by few--, but among those who were permitted to retain such moments, to grasp the fugitive evanescence of death\u2019s shape, he who succeeded in giving shape to death by incessant listening and searching would find together with its genuine form his own real shape as well, he was shaping his own death and with it his own shape...he looked back on this life of abnegation, of an actually still continuing renunciation, on this life that had been with resistance to death though full of resistance to participation and love, he looked back on this life of farewell that lay back of him in the dusk of rivers, in the dusk of poetry...But in many many others it\u2019s just bottomless verbage.Broch was writing in the late 1930s, having fled Nazi Germany after being jailed, and Ruge is writing post GDR, with a narrator who has been abandoned by his long-time girlfriend, and has fled a gentrifying Prenzlauer Berg that dismays him. In addition to asking about perception, both are asking what has happened to my Germany, and how do I find my way forward? Ruge\u2019s book is certainly not as weighty (in any sense of the word) as Broch\u2019s, but based on the reviews of his In Times of Fading Light I conclude he has dealt with these questions more fully in that work. Ruge\u2019s Gato is related to Death though, in that both are about writers: Ruge\u2019s narrator is at the very rocky start of his writing career, while Virgil is obviously at the end of his. But both writers are obsessed with the search and how to know and capture reality. And both books end with a death.Yesterday, after the second half of that beautiful opera, it hit me that the beautiful evanescent light bars and the boat that the Pilgrim poles back and forth across the sea-stage, in the Met production, are absolutely the perfect setting for Virgil\u2019s voyages toward death. (Also, L\u2019Amour de Loin echos the East/West tension and voyage across the Mediterranean of The Death. Even Cabo is set on the southern edge of Spain, looking toward Africa.) So, if you can see either the opera or the HD rebroadcast, I highly recommend it. If not, here is is a link to several clips that show how the ever-changing lights filling the stage evoke the surge of the sea, and the boat and its \u2018captain\u2019 call to mind Virgil\u2019s real and imaginary voyages, particularly that of Part IV:http://www.metopera.org/Season/2016-1...Oh yes, where do I apply for my merit badge for finishing this? A month ago I realized I had made very little progress this year on my retirement project of working through Philip Ward\u2019s 500 books list, so I figured this would count double credit. Boy did it. But I also chose another one off the list, a swashbuckler, to offset it: The Outlaws of the Marsh.

In doing this he was adhering to certain principles that he had outlined in an essay, \"Joyce and the Present Age\", written in the previous year. In this essay he argued that \"the work of art, the \"universal work of art\" becomes the mirror of the Zeitgeist\"; that being the totality of the historic reality of the present age. This totality is reflected in great works of art like Faust and the late works of Beethoven. Reaching his fiftieth year was significant for Broch as a time that would allow him to achieve this sort of significance in his own writing. The work known as The Death of Virgil would be his \"great work of art\". With the use of third person narrative that often seems like a \"stream of consciousness\" Hermann Broch is able to put the reader inside the head of Virgil for much of the book. From the opening pages we meet a poet/artist Virgil who is on the edge of life in several different respects. The edge between water and land is explored as Virgil's ship, one among the parade of ships escorting Augustus back to the port of Brundisium in Roman Italy, sails toward land on the first page of the novel. \"as the sunny yet deathly loneliness of the sea changed with the peaceful stir of friendly human activity where the channel, softly enhanced by the proximity of human life and human living, was populated by all sorts of craft\". (p 11) The sunny sea is seen as also deathly in its loneliness. This signals another edge that will be important throughout the novel as Virgil in his illness hovers between life and death. Further there is the personal and historical background with the tension between Virgil and Augustus mirroring that of Athens and Rome. Even though Virgil dearly loved the life of study and thought in Athens he was torn by his memories of home as he arrived in Brundisium: \"lifted up in the breath of the immutable coolness, borne forward to seas so enigmatic and unknown that it was like a homecoming, for wave upon wave of the great planes through which his keel had already furrowed, wave-planes of memory, wave-planes of seas, they had not become transparent, nothing in them had divulged itself to him, only the enigma remained, and filled with the enigma of the past overflowed its shores and reached into the present, so that in the midst of the resinous torch-smoke, in the midst of the brooding city fumes, , , how they all lay behind him, about him, within him, how entirely they were his own,\" (p 31)Throughout the beginning of the novel, a section titled \"Water--The Arrival\", Virgil is filled with doubts. He is nearing the end of his life with a feeling that \"it was time itself that called down scorn upon him, the unalterable flood of time with its manifold voices,\" and he may not be able to escape his fate. But what was that fate and why was it important to him as creator? This is something that he is unsure of even to the point of asking himself why he was writing this book (The Aeneid which is always by his side). \"Nothing availed the poet, he could right no wrongs; he is heeded only if he extols the world, never if he portrays it as it is. Only falsehood wins renown, not understanding! And could one assume that the Aeneid would be vouchsafed another or better influence?\" (p 15)His own Aeneid as quoted epigraphically by Broch suggests that Virgil is \"exiled by fate\" just as his creation, Aeneas, was. Is that the fate of all poets? Must they be exiled by their fate to become an artist of this world? Perhaps the final three sections of The Death of Virgil will suggest answers to these and other questions."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93909-joe", "userReview": "This novel had a huge impact on me, as a vision of our conscious transformation from a cause-and-effect view of the world into a perception of the eternal, divine truths which must have no beginning or end. Whether you believe or not, you must undergo this trial whereby you know there are things you cannot know.Broch chronicles the last 24 hours of the Virgil's life, when the poet decides he must burn the Aeneid, until Augustus himself convinces him not to. Virgil's destructive decision stems from the revelation he is granted of the coming of Christ and the inherent freedom of all people under the eye of God. Augustus, though, frees him from the weight of the Aeneid, by taking it as his own for the Roman people, as Virgil accepts the futility of beauty in the face of truth. Virgil's last earthly act is the freeing of his own slaves. He then passes into a state of enlightenment, where he journeys out of existence into the creative font of the universe. At the final moment, he hears the word of God, the one word for which there is no language, and he is peacefully destroyed by it.The writing goes at a fever pitch for the entire book, stopping only to dive into Virgil and Augustus's philosophical debate. The long descriptions of existence and creation come seemingly from a trance, with Broch determined to write everything Virgil sees, no matter how exhaustive or immense the resulting catalog of existence is.\"for this seeing, befuddled, unrecognized evil was beyond the reach of every governmental enterprise, beyond reach of every earthly force however great, beyond reach, perhaps, of the gods themselves, and no human outcry sufficed to overwhelm it except, it may be, the small voice of the soul, called song, which while it makes known the evil, announces also the awakening of salvation, knowledge aware, knowledge-fraught, knowledge-persuading, the provenance of every true song\" [13, on the outcry for Augustus when he arrives]\"the mighty all-embracing domain of death in which he, ever aware of the goal and yet seeking it, he a path-seeker in the dome of death, had day-dreamed a whole life away... no vocation measured up to that, as none exists that is not exclusively subserviated to the knowledge of life, none with the exception of that one to which he had finally been driven and which is called poetry, the strangest of all human occupations, the only one dedicated to the knowledge of death.\" [64]\"the justification of a task or the lack of its justification was not to be reckoned by its earthly accomplishments\" [68]\"commanding him to search for his own shape in that of death and thus to win the freedom of his soul; for freedom is a compulsion of the soul whose redemption or damnation is always at stake, and he heeded the injunction, obedient to the task of his fate.\" [68]\"verily man is held into his task of knowing, and nothing is able to dissuade him, not even the inevitability of error, the bound nature of which vanishes before the task beyond all chance;\" [82]\"nothing had occurred without necessity, nothing occurs without necessity, because the necessity of the human soul, the necessity of the human task overruled every circumstance, even the wrong road, even the error; for only amidst error, only through error in which he was inescapably held, did man come to be the seeker that he was, the seeking human; for man needed the realization of futility, he must accept its dread, the dread of all error, and recognizing it, he must drain it to the dregs... that through such conscious assimilation the dread might be expunged, only thus might one pass through the portal of dread and achieve existence;\" [83]\"the perogative of gods and man was laughter, from the intuition of his own destructability\" [104]\"the pledge was broken, the pledge that was given at the obscure beginning, the pledge that must be kept by gods and men although no one knows what it is, no one except the unknown god, for all language stemmed from him\" [109]\"woe to this seeming timelessness which was the essence of all intoxication and which, to maintain such diversion, must needs continue to substitute the thing created for that which creates\" [128]147 - decides to burn the Aeneid\"grace fused with the pledge, disclosing itself not as word, not as speech, far rather as symbol of a word, as symbol of all speech, as symbol of every voice, as the arch-image of them all, overcoming fate in the form of the holy father-summons, it revealed itself as the tone-picture of the annunciating deed: 'Open your eyes to Love!'\" [187]\"'I was impatient for perception... that is why I wanted to write down everything'\" {Virgil, 274}\"I have only hemmed in death by metaphor, Augustus\" [280]\"all reality is but the growth of perception\" [308]\"The goal of the state is the realm of truth, extending over all lands yet growing like a tree from the depths of earth to those of heaven, for it is the growing piety out of which will unfold the kingdom, the peace of the kingdom, and reality is the revelation of truth.\" [318]\"so free of memory and therefore so completely remembered, that all these friendly forms passed into a new interstate of memory, into a new interstate of comprehensibility, full of light-casting shadows within muted sounds. They passed into second immensity.\" [383]\"the quiet glance of the spheres reflecting itself in itself, the grey eye of the water and the darker grey of the heavenly-eye above widening and merging to a day-impregnated night, to a dawn-dusk in which there was no duration or occurrence, no name, no chance, no memory, no fate.\" [388]\"nothing was to be found which would not have been at the same time both star and shadow; even the human spirit having become a star no longer cast the shadow that is language.\" [399]\"his heart that long since had ceased from being a heart, only a lyre, ah yes, now a lyre, as if at last the promise were to ring out among its starry strings, not the song itself but the annunciation of it, the hour of song, the hour of birth and rebirth, the hour of twofold leading awaited without expectation, the singing hour at the closing point of the circle, crying out the unity of the world on the last breath of the universe\" [409]And at the end, Virgil turns around and sees all of creation behind him, folding out again into the world [my summary]"}, {"userName": "Joshua", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18211332-joshua", "userReview": "There are passages in The Death of Virgil that are just breathtaking. At times the novel can be quite bewildering, at others it can be nearly dreadful, but the strong passages really make the confusion and the temporary frustration worth the while.Broch, in fact, is at his best when putting the hallucinatory confusion and chaos he has sown around the reader to direct use. In one scene, Virgil sits in his room discussing the fate of his unfinished masterpiece with two of his friends. While talking with his two acquaintances Virgil has a series of overlapping illusions. He has visions of a young boy who earlier in the book Virgil spied weaving his way through the clamoring mob. Virgil simultaneously speaks with the boy and speaks about the boy with his two friends who cannot see him. Its unclear who the boy is and why he keeps visiting Virgil and Virgil has a difficult time even discovering the young boys name. There's also a servant in the room. He speaks in vague platitudes and pseudo-christian prophecies which Virgil verbally muses upon while contemplating the true purpose of his art. Its also unclear whether the friends in the room can see the servant or if they are just ignoring him. The servant and the young boy take turns interrupting one another and Virgil as the layers of hallucination begin to pile up and a chorus of confusion rises to a fervent pitch. Virgil also hallucinates about a woman, perhaps a mother figure or a long lost lover. She beckons him to join her in a paradisaical alternative dimension that weaves its way through the conversation taking place in Virgil's room. Its all very bewildering and very beautiful.Here are a couple of the passages I marked up:\"Was it not your path, oh, Virgil, that which was trod by Aeneas? You too pressed on in the darkness, pressed on for homecoming journey, there where the moonbeams quivered in light on the ebbing sea...\"\"Yea, I was driven toward darkness, yet it was not of my willing, pressing on ever within it, I pierced at last to its womb, yet I did not dive under; stony the cave I found, no river ran through it, beyond all my search was the lake in the cavern of night's staring eye...Plotia I saw, but I found not my father, and she also vanished...no one was waiting to guide me, I foundered without resurrection; then came the voice, then I heard it, and now there is light...\"and also:\"- yet he was echoless, a dead reverberation in the desert mountains of Tartarus which had shot up to remain there forever, he was a mute echo of a breath-wringing gasp in the dry chasms and in the crystal shafts of petrification; he was a sightless skull, rolled out into the stone rubble on the shadowy shores of oblivion, rolled under the dry, dense shrubbery on the shores of the shadowy stream, rolled toward a void so totally without egress that it extinguished oblivion itself; he was nothing but a blind eye, without trunk, without voice, without breath, emptied of breath, and thus he was thrown out to the vacuous blindness of the underworld [...]\"In the last section of the book all of the dense imagery and the cosmic confusion take a stranglehold on the narrative and for about 60 pages Broch paints brilliant colorful surreal masterpieces one after the other. This was one of the more exhilarating and unique passages I have read in quite a while. In the end, the highs far outweigh the lows of this novel (though there are some pretty significant portions of the book that I could not get past fast enough). I'll definitely read more of Broch's work and would confidently recommend The Death of Virgil to any with an artistic or academic interest in modernism."}, {"userName": "Jale", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36331944-jale", "userReview": "470 sayfal\u0131k a\u015fka, \u00f6l\u00fcme, do\u011faya \u00f6vg\u00fc; sanat\u00e7\u0131 ve dahi sanata yergi.

L'unica via di salvezza \u00e8, perci\u00f2, la sua distruzione. Di fronte all'assolutezza della morte, Virgilio percepisce l'inconcludenza della propria vita e della propria opera. E questo fa abbastanza impressione se si pensa che Broch ha scritto la maggio parte di questo romanzo in un carcere nazista, sicuro di andare incontro alla morte non meno di quanto lo fosse Virgilio a Brindisi. \u00c8 il paradosso di uno scrittore che, convinto di essere in punto di morte, scrive un'opera letteraria proprio sull'insensatezza dell'opera letteraria stessa di fronte alla morte.Il romanzo \u00e8 articolato in quattro parti, diverse per stile e contenuto: nella prima Virgilio arriva a Brindisi, e si accorge di essere stato \"un ospite nella sua stessa vita\"; la seconda parte \u00e8 un lunghissimo flusso di coscienza che sviscera in modo ossessivo il fallimento della missione poetica di Virgilio; nella terza parte i contenuti della seconda vengono dibattuti con Augusto; la quarta parte, infine, descrive il vero e proprio passaggio verso la morte, in cui Virgilio tocca finalmente l'Assoluto e l'Unit\u00e0, trovando nel Logos ineffabile la chiusura del cerchio (anche se a questo punto Broch ci ha convinti dell'impossibilit\u00e0 di descrivere l'assoluto con mezzi terreni).\u00c8 da un po' di tempo che il tema dell'assoluto raggiungibile solo nella morte ritorna nelle mie letture. Forse sono io che ci presto pi\u00f9 attenzione da quando, l'anno scorso, ho letto il saggio di Todorov La bellezza salver\u00e0 il mondo (ma il titolo originale, Les aventuriers de l'absolu \u00e8 pi\u00f9 eloquente), in cui si spiega come Wilde, Rilke e la Cvetaeva siano stati consumati dal tentativo di toccare l'assoluto con la loro vita e le loro opere, e di come la loro ricerca li abbia portati a non saper pi\u00f9 \"stare al mondo\", a non trovare pi\u00f9 conforto nei rapporti umani. \u00c8 quello che succede anche al Virgilio del romanzo, che non riesce pi\u00f9 a instaurare un dialogo efficace n\u00e9 con Augsto n\u00e9 con i suoi amici, e che avverte l'impossibilit\u00e0 di comunicare la propria angoscia.Non posso nascondere, d'altra parte, che lo stile di scrittura rende quest'opera faticosissima da leggere: il periodare \u00e8 lungo e complesso, spesso prolisso e ridondante (il contrario, insomma, di leggerezza e rapidit\u00e0 elogiate da Calvino nelle Lezioni americane). Ci sono due o tre argomenti su cui si continua a battere che crescono come panna montata fino a diventare soffocanti e ci sono temi e motivi che forse vengono tirati un po' all'eccesso. L'angoscia di Virgilio (e di Broch), per\u00f2, \u00e8 potente, e il lettore non pu\u00f2 lasciarla inascoltata. Una vita ormai estranea al mondo, ma a cui non \u00e8 concesso toccare l'infinito. La morte, allora, \u00e8 per Virgilio il vero lieto fine."}, {"userName": "J.M.

With \"Virgil\" this was a nightly occurrence. I only continued reading it because it's considered by no lesser figures than the likes of George Steiner and Thomas Mann as one of the pinnacles of European literature. Well...there are passages of exquisite beauty and the overarching idea is interesting (art as linked to perception which is linked to love and thus utter enlightenment) but Broch brings the notions across much more in his (what I thought were) abstruse philosophical writings. However, what he 's done in \"Virgil\" is try way too hard to convey some aesthetic notions of the ethics of art in a bombastic, repetitive, and downright treacly way.

Rather than being a pretentious and dry example of Classic Lit 101, it is instead considered something of a legendary modern classic in every sense of the meaning. Personally, I regard its reputation as more than well deserved on the writing alone but it would appear that it also has another appeal to others through its origin story as well. The author, Herrmann Broch, was Austrian writer born to Jewish parents in 1886 who later converted to Roman Catholicism at the age of 23 in 1909. In 1938, with the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, neither his heritage nor his newfound religion put him in good standing with the fascist regime and he was interned in a concentration camp.It was in this dismal and foreboding setting that he began work writing this particular novel. However, not to downplay the experience in any way but his time here was fortunately fairly brief due to the efforts of his many friends that eventually succeeded in gaining his release. Regardless, the overall theme of impending death in this novel is seen by many to mirror this harrowing experience, which lends more of an authoritative voice to the writing as well as a certain \u201clife imitating art\u201d legend to it. The plot of this novel is centered on the famous Roman poet Virgil who has taken seriously ill with a fever while traveling to visit the emperor by royal command. The book is told in \u201creal time\u201d spanning over a period of twenty-four hours as Virgil makes this journey. Only this is merely more of a backdrop and setting for his thoughts, which take the main stage. Thus, the book becomes more of a psychological one over one of any action. As his illness takes hold of him, the writing of this book takes on a surreal turn and here the narrative becomes a stunning work of stream of consciousness, at times abandoning sentence structure entirely similar to Joyce\u2019s Ulysses. However, the overall effect of this is not one of imitation but one of creating a unique prose poem that has not seen the like anywhere else in the history of literature. It is a mammoth undertaking in execution, story and form and is nothing less than the work of an inspired genius at the top of his game. Naturally, the structure of this novel is claimed to be superior in the original German. However, as the English translator, Jean Starr Untermeyer, worked closely with the author for over a period of five years on this book and it is often said that she should nearly be credited as co-author. So, there is some consolation here that the English version is as close to the original intent as possible. This writing here is literally a song cycle of sorts, repeating key words and phrases as the narrative progresses that slowly builds to up to a crescendo in its frenzied pace and surreal imagery. All of the combined efforts of the beat poets such as Burroughs or Kerouac pale in comparison to this work. Here, the artistry of the written word is not just window dressing to hang dazzling forms of expression but are also equal in power to its very message. All the while, the narrative is seen to blend psychology, philosophy and poetry together in harmony with one another to heights seldom achieved previously, if not outright inventing new ones. Virgil\u2019s epic poem is considered to have completely rewritten the style and form of poetry in its day and revolutionized how it was approached from that point on. Broch\u2019s reputation is considered by many to have likewise achieved this very same aim in the writing of this book but seems to have somehow slipped from memory. It\u2019s high time that it had a revival. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Asa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1904061-asa", "userReview": "The death of Virgil is a book that really didn't work for me, and I've spent some time trying to figure out why. It wasn't because of the obvious things - bad writing, one-dimensional characters, uninteresting plot - or because of a pet peeve, but I had to force myself to finish it. For me, books are made out of four building blocks: Characters, Plot, Setting and Language. It varies from book to book how they are used and how important they are, and all readers have different opinions about which one(s) matter to them. Plot is most obvious in mysteries, thrillers or adventure stories, where you read to find out what happens. When it comes to character I think of authors like Jane Austen or Shakespeare, where there has been a lot of adaptations into different times or environments, like Clueless or Bridget Jones' diary for Austen and Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet or Ran, Kurosawa's version of King Lear, for Shakespeare. Setting is the opposite, where if you try to move the plot and characters somewhere else a lot of the book is lost, like Kipling's Kim or Wharton's The age of innocence. My favorite writers when it comes to language is Virginia Woolf and and Patrick O'Brian, where it almost doesn't matter what they write because I will read it and like it.What I've discovered is that while I talk and think about the characters the most, love an interesting and vivid setting, and can take or leave plot, the real deal breaker for me is the language. If I love how the author writes I can read and enjoy almost any book even if the content isn't something I would normally pick, if I'm neutral or don't notice the writing I can like the other parts, but if the language doesn't work for me I can't enjoy the book at all. I don't mean obvious bad writing - spelling mistakes, clumsy sentences or a lack in editing - but language that for some reason rubs me the wrong way and makes it impossible for me to focus on the rest of the book.In this book, Virgil is dying (see the title) and on his deathbed, while feverish and hallucinating, he looks back on his life and work and feels that he has failed in what he tried to do, which was to create a work of art that would both mirror the real world and show how to make it better. While talking to his friends and the emperor Virgil tries to explain why he feels this way, and how false art shouldn't be preserved or read and that therefore he wants to burn the Aeneid, and in between he has these really intense images or hallucinations. These images go on for pages and pages, without any breaks or pauses, with the sentences that never seemed to end and repeated the same things over and over with some variations, and as the book went on and Virgil slipped away he became more and more metaphysical in the way he described the universe. This is where the author lost me, because while I was reading I stopped focusing and often I came to the end of a page and had no memory of what I'd just read, because the way he described things just slid away. It isn't just the subject or the experimenal writing, since my favorite Woolf is The waves, so I've come to realize that it's Broch's language that throws me out."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54697-matt", "userReview": "i went into this book with high hopes.

Loved it, by the way, so that was time well spent.And I'm definitely a fan of the Modernist several-pages-to-a-sentence, subjective immediacy style (Joyce, Faulkner, Woolf, etc) But this was just...exhausting.

Thomas Mann and Albert Einstein were close friends. Exile is the subtext.I was inspired to read this novel after reading Yourcenar's \"Memoirs of Hadrian.\" It interested me how European intellectuals struggled with their cultural legacy during the rise of fascism, and poured much of their thoughts and feelings into works like these. \"Der Tod des Vergil\" book takes place 19 BC in a sort of \"real time\" stream of consciousness. So while Virgil is suffering from fever and hallucinations during the last night of his life in Brindisi, the text takes as many hour to read as it took Virgil to get through to dawn. Or longer, I read the book on and off for four months. Brace yourself. The language is Wagnerian: it worked best for me to think of the text as an opera score, and just enjoy the onward rush of language, endless invented descriptive compound nouns (one of the creative aspects of the German language (try \"Himmelsverborgenheiten.\"), along with endless pleonasm, seeming contradictions (\"Vor-Echo kuenftigen Klanges\") lots of leitmotif going on, and abrupt symphonic changes of tempo. The basic plot is pretty clear and close to history, so no worry about spoilers. We know Virgil is about to die, we know he has almost completed his masterpiece the Aeneid. And although we know he wants to destroy the manuscript, we all know it survived. The beauty is in the gorgeous, sometimes bombastic language, rather parallel to Wagner's gorgeous, bombastic music. The text incorporates quotations from various works by Virgil, some in custom German translations by a fellow refugee, these are enchanting, making it clear why his poetry was so loved over the centuries.Since I know absolutely nothing about the history of ancient Rome--a recent tour of the ruins only confused me more, I relied pretty heavily on Google searches to get the references. It seems that Virgil was one of the few pagan writers revered by the early Christians due to a few brief references to the coming of a savior, which they interpreted as prophesy of Christ. Broch includes lots of references to a mysterious, long awaited Heilbringer. I tried to find evidence of any ancient Virgil manuscripts, they all seem to have been copied and recopied in the Middle Ages, so I kept wondering if the manuscript was preserved because it contained prophetic references to Christ, or if the prophetic references were added at some point in order to justify preserving Virgil's divine poetry.Virgil has long discussions about beauty, and truth, and \"Erkenntnis\" with a couple literary friends. The heart of the book is an argument between the dying poet and the triumphantly victorious new emperor, Octavian Caesar Augustus. The poet doesn't think the Aeneid is good enough, the emperor demands that he relinquish it to be published (I assume professionally copied). Here there are some jarring anachronisms, like referring to the manuscript as paper, when paper had not yet reached Europe, but no mind, the argument is interesting. There are ironic bits, so Virgil says that Caesar's work will endure after his poem is forgotten, and we know the reverse is true...In the end the emperor needs the work as a foundation myth for his empire and he will get his way. The argument takes place during a swarm of small earthquakes that shake the ground, and a couple mysterious nonexistent figures drift in and out: a preternaturally insightful Greek peasant boy Lysanias, an odd \"Eastern\" slave who constantly contradicts the emperor (who doesn't hear), and Plotia, an old unconsummated flame of sorts. Virgil eventually relents and lets the emperor have the unfinished masterpiece. Virgil makes one dying request, that his slaves be freed, even though this will have a negative financial impact on his heirs. The emperor gets his book. He needs a magnificent foundation narrative that links him with greatness, so with Greece and with heroic ancestors. The book is saved because it is needed. As Virgil dies he seems to go through the biblical creation story in reverse, and seems to visit some sort of peaceable kingdom. After stretching language for 500 pages, Virgil lands somewhere beyond words."}, {"userName": "Jackson Cyril", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4044163-jackson-cyril", "userReview": "I thought Mann wrote long sentences...until I read Broch.

Either way, I felt a lot of things.Broch's The Death of Virgil, is about, well. The death of Virgil, Rome's greatest poet. It follows his fever-ridden thoughts as he sails, near-death, to Brundisium after falling ill in Greece. The book is written as a stream of consciousness, which makes it a difficult read. But it's well worth it for being able to take a glimpse into what the mind of the ever-sensitive, ever-observant Virgil might have been like.Probably don't read it late at night, though."}], "description": "It is the reign of the Emperor Augustus, and Publius Vergilius Maro, the poet of the Aeneid and Caesar's enchanter, has been summoned to the palace, where he will shortly die. Out of the last hours of Virgil's life and the final stirrings of his consciousness, the Austrian writer Hermann Broch fashioned one of the great works of twentieth-century modernism, a book that embraces an entire world and renders it with an immediacy that is at once sensual and profound.Begun while Broch was imprisoned in a German concentration camp, The Death of Virgil is part historical novel and part prose poem - and always an intensely musical and immensely evocative meditation on the relation between life and death, the ancient and the modern.", "title": "The Death of Virgil", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27426.The_Death_of_Virgil", "average": 4.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436853064l/27426.jpg", "reviews": 93, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15386.Hermann_Broch", "name": "Hermann Broch"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1235203.Jean_Starr_Untermeyer", "name": "Jean Starr Untermeyer"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "European Literature", "Poetry", "Classics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27426.The_Death_of_Virgil", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22711993", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22144711-a-morte-de-virg-lio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16096325-vergilius-un-l-m", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9654528-la-morte-di-virgilio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7370093-the-death-of-virgil", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25713722-vergilii-d-d", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1109952.La_muerte_de_Virgilio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2769067-der-tod-des-vergil", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1799255.The_Death_of_Virgil", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/238367.The_Sleepwalkers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/238369.The_Guiltless", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/571921.The_Spell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/568797.Pasenow_oder_die_Romantik", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2033251.The_Anarchist"]}
