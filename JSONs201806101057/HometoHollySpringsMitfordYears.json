I laugh, I cry, I can't wait to finish the book and yet I don't want it to end. Is it because Father Tim is a minister who is so humanly fallible? Or is it because he is surrounded by intriguing people and circumstances that make such a good story?  One thing that appeals to me is that even though Karon's characters struggle and face hard decisions and physical difficulties (in other words, all of life!) she writes in a uplifting tone. Being an optimist myself I really relate to this kind of writing. Can't say anymore without spoiling the book!"}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4098759-margaret", "userReview": "Reading this book was like sitting on the porch sipping lemonade and talking with old friends. Truth be told it reminded me of my childhood days listening to my parents and family talk about the old days. I was thinking back to the visits to Kentucky listening to conversation and meals at the dinner table. One of my favorite things to do is to read and when a book helps me to re-capture a memory of an age long gone, I am quite happy. There are few authors that can handle conversation between characters deftly as this author. Father Tim rang true to me in this story and became fleshed out thoroughly. I am going to miss him now and I plan on reading all the books in the series."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1042421-barbara", "userReview": "With the shift away from Mitford, I wondered how things would work for the Father Tim stories. Well...just fine! This was my second time reading it and it was worth multiple readings. Probably the most emotionally charged in a way, potent with Father Tim's memories of growing up, as he fills in the gaps between what he remembers and the realities he didn't understand (or wasn't even aware of). After the years of \"dropped hints\" in the other Mitford novels, it was cool to get a more full story regarding Father Tim. Just make sure you have the tissues handy! I know it's been criticized for a few too many \"coincidences\" but a good author can get away with those in the right context, and this time it worked. Especially in Father Tim's long-standing desire for a brother. Overall this is really a story about grace, forgiveness, restoration, and yes, what home is really all about.While many beloved characters never make an appearance, I think this is probably one of my favorites in the series."}, {"userName": "Julie Gentino", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1031536-julie-gentino", "userReview": "Jan Karon's Mitford series are my comfort books - the first books that come to mind when I am sick or depressed or just need a light, heart-warming read. It is hard for me to describe just how much I love these books and the characters in them, but let's just say my husband thinks it's very weird! Home to Holly Springs is the first of Karon's new Father Tim series (sequel to the Mitford series). The reviews I had read said it is not as good and I would agree with them. Karon is a terrific story-teller and I think anything she writes is a pleasure to read, but Home to Holly Springs just didn't have the same magic as her former novels. She seemed so intent on wrapping up all loose ends of Father Tim's childhood that her characters fell a bit flat and too many unrealistic coincidences occurred."}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2206131-steven", "userReview": "Sometimes you cannot divorce a book from the personal context in which you read it. In this case, it was a divine pairing. Just when I needed it most, I reached some of the most climactic events in this grace-filled work. It ministered to me and helped me to better handle the challenges I was facing. Briefly, my son, vice president of his freshman class, got in trouble at school for horseplay, was railroaded through a kangaroo court, was not allowed to offer a defense (or to speak at all) and no recourse was available when he suffered a punishment only one step short of expulsion from the private Christian school (a school whose motto last year was \u201ca culture of grace\u201d). As a lawyer, father, and former teacher, accepting the school\u2019s decisions was difficult at best. But Karon\u2019s book helped me. Each morning, lunch hour, and evening, her work imparted nuggets of grace to me that not only blessed me, but blessed my family. The grace in her book helped me give grace to my son when he felt beaten-down and rejected on all sides. The book helped me encourage my wife, who struggled with the loyalties she felt as both a Bible teacher at the school and as the mother of a son she believed had done the \u201ccrime,\u201d but not a crime worthy of the outrageous sentence. The book helped me remain quiet when other parents of similarly prosecuted sons were arguing with the administration in the mornings and meeting with lawyers in the afternoons. In short, God used the simple, charming book, Home to Holly Springs, to give grace to me and my entire family during a time when we needed it desperately. I have not read any other books by Jan Karon. But I will."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2868865-rachel", "userReview": "Even though this is considered a Father Tim novel rather than a Mitford novel, it is chronologically number 10 of the Mitford series except for the fact Father Tim is visiting his hometown in Mississippi for the entire novel. So, I consider this to be the tenth book of a laid back series about an Episcopalian priest in a small town in North Carolina. It is often funny and sweet with the occasional sad vignette mixed into the plot. According to my records, I've read this novel before, but it must have been a long time ago because I'd completely forgotten it. Anyhow, it explained a lot about Father Tim's background and served to develop his character even more, and I enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "The Library Lady", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady", "userReview": "The believability factor of the Mitford books has always been dicey, but this goes beyond that and into fairy tale land. Without giving much away,Father Tim goes home and finds ALL of his various long lost friends and relations--often by pure serendipity. And hasn't Karon used the \"relative you didn't know you had\" bit once too often? Or does everyone born south of the Mason Dixon line fornicate that freely? (If so, I am worrying for my daughters--I live in Virginia :) )This is a cozy read, like all the Mitford books. And I don't expect hard bitten reality from Karon.

She brings us with them as they grow and change over a number of years. Tim is an Episcopal priest and faith has a large place in these works. But the faith part is actually inspiring and deftly done. Karon is wonderful at bringing people and situations to life -- often with humor and always with great compassion for her characters. If you like a gentle but compelling story and haven't read any Jan Karon yet, give her a try. I think it's best to start at the beginning of the world she created: At Home in Mitford.

This is the first in the Father Tim series. I read the Mitford series first. I recommend reading the Father Tim series where it goes in the order of the Mitford series, which is between #9 Light From Heaven and #10 Somewhere Safe with Somebody Good, I believe. This book does stand alone, as all of her books do, but if you like reading books in the order in which they happened, that's where it goes. I really enjoyed this book. It told the story of Father Tim's childhood, things he didn't know about himself. If you like to put puzzles together, you'll like this book. Everything fit nicely together except for the last piece still being a mystery. I love the way she wove so many pieces of his past together in this story. Anyone who dreams of reconciling their past with their present (and future) will enjoy this author's work in Home to Holly Springs.That being said, it is not an easy or light read. And it sheds light on the wisdom in not knowing everything when you are going through it, or when you are young. The wisdom of experience is a great teacher.The only thing I didn't like about this book, which is necessary to the story, is that I missed all of the Mitford characters. I hope the author writes more Holly Springs books! It would be nice to get to know the Holly Springs characters better. I highly recommend this book, but caution young readers because it is not light reading, and while clean, it may be better for mature readers."}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/965663-ginger", "userReview": "I loved this book in the end. It was a little hard getting there, because as one reviewer said, this is Karon's \"most emotionally complex novel.\"Truth be told, I've avoided reading the Father Tim novels for years, because I've just loved Mitford too much, and I didn't want it to really end. But I've been rereading the whole series this year (they are great comfort when going through major life changes of your own), so I thought I'd finally delve on in.I love going to Mitford to escape. And I've come to love Father Tim dearly, so to see him go back home and face some of the hard things of his childhood (not to mention to see him be a little naughty as a boy in some cases), wasn't always pleasant.But it made the character so much more deep, well-rounded, and in the end, it was beautiful and enjoyable.Oh that we could all have the close, trusting relationship with the Father that Tom Kavanagh enjoys!

I'm not completely sure why I enjoy them so much when other close friends \"can't get into them.\" I guess we just enjoy different types of books. Someday I'll find my \"bosom (reading) friend.\" :) I think it has something to do with me enjoying fiction/verse and the whimsical things in life.

While it was enjoyable and wholesome, I missed Mitford and all the \"regulars\" and I just didn't really care about the new characters that much, except for the mysterious Peggy. I also got confused a lot, because there were a lot of unannounced flashbacks that were disorienting.

You don't need to read the Mitford Series to enjoy this book, but it would give you a little context into Timothy Kavanaugh's story. Having said that, the characters are colorful and complex, the story is heartwarming and the message of forgiveness is one we can all learn from. I would have given it 5 stars, except I had to admit (as much as I love a happy ending) that the chances of every loose end wrapping up so nicely was far-fetched. Will be reading the next one, though!

Father Tim is back home, and is mostly just \"Timmy Cavanagh\". Going home is always wonderful and always hard. Jan Karon got the emotion right, and it plays out beautifully. Knowing a bit more about the beginning of Father Tim's life put so many things in place for me in the other books. And a few in my own story as well. Father Tim has always reminded me a bit of my brother, David--also a minister until his death and a bachelor for all but a few of those years. He didn't have a dog like Barnabas, but all comparisons have their stopping points. I always feel closer to my brother when I read a book about Father Tim. When I read this book, I once again saw the characters in all their dimensions and heard their personalities in the conversations. This ability to let me SEE the people is my favorite thing about Jan's books. I KNOW so many of these people in my own life!!! Everyone has an Uncle Billy and Rose. A few lucky ones also have an extended family as comforting and challenging as Mitford and now Holly Springs.

They learned quickly that after you've spent time in Mitford, you'll want to come back (Chicago Tribune). Millions eagerly awaited the publication of each novel, relishing the story of the bookish and bighearted Episcopal priest and the extraordinary fullness of his seemingly ordinary life.  Now, Jan Karon enchants us with the story of the newly retired priest's spur-of-the-moment adventure.
