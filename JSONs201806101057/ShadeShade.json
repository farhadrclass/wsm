I assumed this would be a dark tale of ghosts and what not, with your obligatory love triangle and a heroine without much of a personality. What I got was a dark tale of ghosts and what they could become, Shades. I also got a tragic, vulnerable relationship between a heroine with depth and personality, and an aspiring musician whose parting came too soon. And GOOD LORD, it was heartfelt and it made me cry. Jeri Smith-Ready could teach an AP course on making you feel the pain. I developed such an attachment to Aura and Logan's relationship. Even though I knew what was going to happen by the synopsis, the way Logan died was so horrifyingly unexpected. Talk about psychologically damaging for Aura (and me). Her pain was terribly palpable. I really appreciated the fact that Aura's (and the rest of her and Logan's friends) grief process was not skimmed over. When you lose someone close to you, especially someone you love, you don't cry for a few minutes and then move on with your life. That's not realistic. The feelings and the deep sense of loss shown by all parties involved were believable and that's why it had such an effect on me. I felt like I knew these characters. Aura and Logan's struggle with attempting to maintain their relationship, despite Logan's less-than-living state, was entirely angst-ridden. Her desperation to keep him in her life, regardless of the fact that she should be hoping for his soul to be at peace. Ohhh, did I cry. I'd want the same dang thing, Aura. This book still affects me quite frequently. Oh, Logan. Why? WHY were you so horribly stupid?!Enter Scottish transfer, Zachary. UNF. One of my favorite thing about this character? The author writes his accent. YES! I can't exactly conjure up a proper Scottish accent in my head, so when it's written phonetically, it helps me do this delicious character more justice in my wicked mind. I was truly torn between my love for dark, devastating Logan and witty Zachary. I can't go into too much detail about Zach and his connection to Aura without being spoilery. I will say, however, that I'm looking forward to learning more about him <3 There are hoards of unanswered questions and topics that became secondary towards the end of the book. I am looking forward to an explanation about \"The Shift,\" and how it works. And how Aura's particular involvement will affect her. And the progression/regression of her relationship(s). I have a feeling, regardless of what happens with either of the guys, I'm going to be sad. DANG IT, Jeri Smith-Ready, making me love both Logan AND Zach so freaking much!! Stupid feelings.Speaking of Jeri, yeah... she wrote this: 'I haven't seen a single ghost all night.' Except Logan, I added mentally. 'That's not true. Look at the Milky way... Some of those stars are already dead. In the thousands of years it takes their light to reach us, they could have exploded or burnt out.' 'So we're seeing them the way they were, not the way they are now...' We packed up the car and drove home, under a sky full of ghosts.Pure brilliance. I need SHIFT in order for my heart to continue beating. May 3 seems like a million years away."}, {"userName": "Jen \u2665Star-Crossed Book Blog\u2665", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28353412-jen-star-crossed-book-blog", "userReview": "Shade was filled with intricate characters, a fun paranormal element and a story-line that kept me glued to the pages. \u00a0Yet this book solidified my distaste for a particular trope, since it's done in a way I can't handle. \u00a0I know many people enjoy love triangles and I can too sometimes, yet I loathe when a heroine flips back and forth between liking the guys. \u00a0I become devastated when I see the boy I fell for get his heart crushed again and again. \u00a0But if you adore multiple love interests, where you don't mind who the heroine ends up with, then you may just fall in love with this story.\nA hole opened up inside me, so raw I had to curl up on my side away from his light, pulling my good knee to my chest to ease the ache. \u00a0The hole gaped so big it seemed like I could crawl inside, let the darkness swallow all thoughts of the future that once stretched before us. \u00a0We had lost forever.\nEveryone born after the Shift can see and talk to ghosts who have a violet hue, and Aura is one of them. \u00a0She's always been a little irritated by it, especially since she helps be their translator in court cases with her Aunt. \u00a0Aura and other kids her age and younger have to be translators because those born before the Shift can't see or talk to ghosts. \u00a0Yet this ability won't be a hindrance to Aura much longer because her boyfriend, Logan, is about to become one of them. \u00a0He dies within the first few chapters of Shade and even though I knew it was coming, I was still devastated when it happened.\nI couldn\u2019t help it. \u00a0I wanted Logan back, even in violet.\nSee....doesn't this sound like a lot of fun? \u00a0A paranormal element that has become the norm in society, a boyfriend and girlfriend whose love doesn't diminish just because he has died? \u00a0Oh I loved all of this! \u00a0And I especially loved Logan. \u00a0He is the singer of a band and even though he can be a little obsessed about being in the public eye, his heart is always set on Aura. \u00a0Logan loves Aura with his whole heart, and even death can't change that. \u00a0He will do anything he can to make her happy, to show her how much he loves her and all of those moments........oh they were beautiful. Yet I didn't always get those same feelings from her.\nAll I know is that I was ecstatically, painfully in love with him, waiting for him to slip away, leaving me with my palms singed from clutching a blue-hot star. \u00a0No matter how many times his eyes found mine, or how brilliantly he smiled at me, I could still taste the bitterness on the sides of my tongue. \u00a0Because he loved the crowd more than he loved any one person, even me. \u00a0He always would.\nAura has huge doubt monsters in her head (in case that excerpt above isn\u2019t obvious enough!). \u00a0Will her boyfriend love her less when he signs the deal with the record label, will he leave her for groupies? \u00a0This girl constantly doubted so much in her life. \u00a0And even though Logan proves himself over and over again even in death, it just never truly sinks in for her. \u00a0So when Zachary, a foreign exchange student, enters the picture after Logan has died and is still around....well let's just say I didn't get the warm and fuzziness for him. Even though Zachary is sexy, nice and tries to help Aura with her grief, I just could never warm up to him. If you're like me, then that's going to be a \nhuge\n problem. \u00a0Because Zachary has a lot of mystery surrounding who he is and he becomes an integral part of this book and to Aura.\n\u201cAura,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI wish I could wipe away just one of your tears. \u00a0Then I\u2019d feel like a person again. \u00a0Like I\u2019m something more than a bunch of light.\u201d\n \n\u201cYou can.\u201d I reached into the space between our bodies. \u201cJust follow me.\u201d\nWhen Aura was leading on and then pausing with both boys time after time, that's when I stopped liking her. \u00a0I couldn't handle seeing my sweet Logan become devastated and have his heart ripped out so many times. \u00a0So to be honest, I was curious what path this series would take. \u00a0I was undecided whether I should stop or continue. \u00a0Luckily a friend lent me this trilogy so I skimmed a few parts in the second book and after what I saw in the second then I went right to the end of the third book. \u00a0I have NEVER done this before! \u00a0But I'm so glad I did because I would have struggled with how this series progressed.So ultimately, I think it's all up to how you handle love triangles. \u00a0If you're like me and get attached to the first and become depressed when another is brought in and refuse to like them, then definitely avoid! \u00a0But if you have an open heart and have no problem caring for both of the boys then definitely give this trilogy a try. \u00a0It was a lot of fun. \u00a0And I didn't even get to talk about how Aura is trying to find a way to stop the Shift from continually happening to those that are born. \u00a0So yeah, lots of fun but so not the right trilogy for me!This review was originally posted on Star-Crossed Book BlogFor more of my reviews, please visit:"}, {"userName": "Morgan F", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2941288-morgan-f", "userReview": "This book could have very nearly been a disaster. It could have taken the sour young-adult fantasy route that I'm experiencing more and more these days. It even had the dreaded love triangle. But, I was pleasantly surprised in the end.This books is about a girl, named Aura (the name made me cringe), who can see ghosts. Which is not unusual because everyone born after the Shift can see the violet figures of people who once were. The night of his 17th birthday, Aura's boyfriend, Logan, dies. He isn't completely gone though, and haunts her whether she wants him to or not. Then enter Zach: the sexy foreign exchange student who has a secret nearly as big as Aura's own.This book moved quickly and fluently, without just being comprised of action. I was sucked in nearly immediately. I was reading this on my laptop, so I began taking my laptop everywhere. The writing, while not particularly stunning, was fluidly done.The characters were strong. Aura, the main character, was no Mary Sue. Assertive and passionate, she was quick-witted enough to hold her own in the tensest conversations. Logan was perfect in that he wasn't perfect. He had a temper, but was overall very sweet. Even though he was dead for 90% of the novel, he managed to develop through out the story. And then there was Zach. Oh. My. God. I think I'm in love. All foreign exchange students are sexy, but a Scottish one? *melts* Smith-Ready must have dived into the deepest parts of my psyche, because he is a man of my dreams. And the love-triangle was well-done. All the emotions Aura felt were believable, and I think readers will be conflicted as to whom to favor.This was a smart paranormal read. The plot was original without being completely out-there. It was exciting and entertaining, with plenty of unanswered questions left at the end. Once the sequel comes out, I guarantee ya I'll be one of the first in line. Oh, and I thought the cover was ugly, but that besides the point."}, {"userName": "Annie Brewer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5315988-annie-brewer", "userReview": "Fuck, this tore my heart out! I love these lyrics, so beautifully haunting and heartwrenching! I HATE ZACH!!!! Logan will always have my heart. Zach can shove his accent up his ass. I can't read the rest of this series, and I won't. Nope, I'm not supporting Zach. I hated him the minute he stepped onto the page. What a shame because I enjoyed Shade. :(Merged review:Every now and then there comes a book that will touch your heart all the way to your soul and leave you breathless. Or in this case sobbing til your eyes fall out. Well this one did that for me. Or in this case, had me crying through the entire book. This book hit a little too close to home for me. I feel so numb. I knew this was gonna be a sad story before I even opened it, but I was never prepared for the heartwrenching effect this really had on me, or the fact that I cried through the entire book that my head felt like it was gonna explode and my eyes felt like they were swollen shut. It was as bad as Forbidden by Tabitha Suzuma, in which I cried pretty hard too. But this one, just broke me. I had snot coming out of my nose and I couldn't see straight half the time. I wanted to curl up in a corner and sob for hours. So let's get on with this review before my mind obliterates into dust.SYNOPSIS:Love ties them together. Death can't tear them apart. Best. Birthday. Ever. At least, it was supposed to be. With Logan's band playing a critical gig and Aura's plans for an intimate after-party, Aura knows it will be the most memorable night of her boyfriend's life. She never thought it would be his last. Logan's sudden death leaves Aura devastated. He's gone. Well, sort of. Like everyone born after the Shift, Aura can see and hear ghosts. This mysterious ability has always been annoying, and Aura had wanted nothing more than to figure out why the Shift happened so she can undo it. But not with Logan's violet-hued spirit still hanging around. Because dead Logan is almost as real as ever. Almost. It doesn't help that Aura's new friend Zachary is so understanding\u2014and so very alive. His support means more to Aura than she cares to admit. As Aura's relationships with the dead and the living grow ever complicated, so do her feelings for Logan and Zachary. Each holds a piece of Aura's heart...and clues to the secret of the Shift.I was stoked to finally get my hands on this. My nook broke and I couldn't purchase it or read it yet and everytime I went to B&N, they were out of the paperback copies. I started to get frustrated. Then the morning my nook arrived, I wasted no time buying it. Though I didn't start til the next day. Oh Jesus, this was a very hard book to read. So many emotions swirled around inside my body, frustration, devastation, joy(brief, but it was there),love, hope, despair...but most of all heartache. Lots of it. I think the reason I took so hard to this book was because it made me think of my ex boyfriend from when I was 13. He was the love of my life, my first love, first kiss. I loved him and we were best friends and we talked about the future alot. His life was taken so suddenly when he was 16. He died in a car accident after letting his drunk friend drive them home after a party and they crashed into a telephone pole. I was devastated when I found out. He left his little brothers behind, my heart ached for them. They were so close. We were all so close. This book brought back all of the emotions I felt that night. I can relate to Aura and it sucks! Even to this day I think about him. You never forget your first love. Not ever. I feel her pain, though I can't see him. Bummer. Both lives were taken too soon because of one stupid mistake. In the book, it was so fast. I barely had time to blink my eye. But then again, that happens in real life as well. The Plot:The plot was so interesting to me. I found the whole shade and shift thing to be very unique and fascinating. I for one, believe in ghosts. Call me crazy, but I think when we die....our spirits live on. Some people claim to see ghosts, so it makes me wonder why some can and some can't. Maybe the people open to this sort of thing can see? I don't know. I just wish I coulod see my dad sometimes. Or maybe even Justin and ask him why he was so stupid to be drinking and driving home with a bunch of drunk guys, we may have ended up together. But then again, it would probably freak me out too. I've just always found ghost stories fascinating, and this one was brilliant. The fact that these kids born at a certain time can see them and the rest can't. I loved it.The Characters:Aura:I was happy with the dynamic of most of the characters. Like I said earlier, I could relate to Aura. I really enjoyed her character and I ached with her through the entire book. It was not easy losing someone you love and then have people blame you for it. Some people are so heartless and it pisses me off. But she handled it all with grace and dignity. She was strong and I wanted to reach out and hug her and cry with her. I really felt connected to her and I hated that she was hurting so much.Megan:I loved her character. She was Aura's best friend and she was always by her side through her everything. She even stuck up for her to all their classmates when rumors were spread about how Logan died. I was so happy Aura had someone like her. She was a very strong secondary character and I look forward to seeing her in the other 2 books.The Keeley brothers:Oh how I love thee. They had such a tight bond with Logan. Mickey the oldest brother playing in Logan's band was also Megan's boyfriend. He reminded me of my ex's middle brother. My heart ached for him too. He couldn't see Logan as a ghost but their younger brother Dylan could. Poor kids. It was so sad, so heartbreaking. Ahhhhh, I just can't stop the tears from flowing as I am writing this review.Zachary:Yea, I have nothing to say about him. He is an exchange student from Scottland and he has an accent. Yea whatever. I don't like him. He swoops in there like he's all Superman to the rescue!! Blablabla. I don't care. He doesn't belong with Aura. Period.Logan:Oh Logan, how you broke my heart to pieces. God, why did you have to be so stupid??? I love you anyway, please come back in the next couple of books. I can't say anything else, my heart is aching at the loss of you and your beautiful singing voice. I wanted to jump in the book and save you!! *SOB SOB SOB*I am not sure what else to say honestly. My head is in a fog, I can't think straight. I did love this book eventhough it took all the energy I had. But it was worth every single tear, and believe me....there were alot! I can't read Shift right away, I will wait a week to read it. I definitely recommend this series though! Just be sure to keep a dozen boxes of tissues handy for all the snotty tears that will come pouring out. FIVE out of FIVE stars!!! FAVORITE QUOTES:\u201cI know you're worried,\" Logan said. \"You think the second I sign a deal, I'll turn into some kind of man-slut.\" He put his hands over mine, pressing my palms against his chest. \"You've always been the only one, and you always will be.\u201d \u201cAura,\" he whispered, \"I wish I could wipe away just one of your tears. Then I'd feel like a person again. Like I'm something more than a bunch of light.\u201d \u201cHonestly?\u201d Logan shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it could kill me. If I\u2019d ever heard that, I forgot it a long time ago. But I knew it was dangerous.\u201d \u201cThen why take the risk?\u201d Stone asked. Logan turned his head to look at me. \u201cBecause she was worth it.\u201d \u201cThe phone in my hand buzzed. Logan had just texted I Love You - so cute how he never abbreviated it.\u201d \u201cHe leaned in. \u201cKiss me, one last time.\u201d I called up a distant memory of his lips against mine. But this time, I kept my eyes open. When he pulled back, Logan passed his hand over my hair. \u201cDon\u2019t forget me, okay?\u201d \u201cHe whispered against my mouth. \u201cWait for me, Aura.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3721849-lindsay", "userReview": "This book is what I would call an 'Awkward Reunion'. Its like meeting someone you haven't seen in a really long time and acting really formal and too sweet with them. I mean, I really tried to like this book. Honestly. But there was just something so...fake about the writing. I felt like Jeri Smith-Ready was trying too hard to sound like a mourning teenager in love who wants to do things her way. She tried to emulate how teenagers act and speak and think but the fact is, people don't act like this, at least not so many people. What I'm trying to say is, all the personalities were purely fantasized. Nothing felt realistic about it. And it certainly didn't come out right on paper.Aura is my primary example of a character gone wrong. No matter what she did, I just couldn't understand what she was about. She was a mystery and not in a good way. Too many mood swings and strange statements made her seem all over the place. Yes, of course she would be all over the place from losing her boyfriend but its the things she would say that put me off. She made teenagers look vain, then strong, then angsty, then obsessive, it was too much. I can't like a character if I can't understand her.Then there's Logan. Okay, the part where he died was incredibly sad, I'll give him that but his personality is disgusting. Seriously. How can Aura like a guy whose as whiny, bratty and selfish as him? It makes no sense to me. He claims he loves her and wants to make love to her, then gets drunk and goes to do cocaine in the bathroom. WHAT THE HELL??? I swear, there was nothing redeeming about his personality. Every moment when it seemed as if he would end up caring for Aura or his family or something, boom! He'd throw a hissy fit, get jealous, try throw things around...he seemed more like a two year old to me then a caring boyfriend.There was nothing romantic between them. Once again, I feel as if Smith-Ready forced the romance into the writing. There was either something between Aura and Logan or something between Aura and Zach who by the way is the most random character to ever show up in a book. Seriously, this kid just popped out of nowhere and he's not very realistic either. Honestly, this love triangle thing that writers are obsessed with has got to die. Its getting old, especially when writers can't even it write it correctly.Overall, as you can see by my rant, I did not like this book. I tried really hard. I honestly did. The style was enough to keep me going almost halfway through the book but not to the end. If all the books in the world were to suddenly spontaneously combust and this would be the only book left, I would be hesitant to pick it up again. There were too many issues with this book so it'll be a long time before I so much as look at the cover.Rating: 2 out of 5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Limonessa", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4147373-limonessa", "userReview": "So I have this huge Post-it note I made on my computer with all the things that are wrong with this book. In fact, I pretty much hated it up to 3/4 of it. Now I find myself at a total loss for words, because, incredibly, I realized I actually liked it.Shade is set in a world where ghosts can be seen walking around. Not by everyone, though. Only by people born after the Shift, a date when unexplainably something changed in the cosmic order of things and newborns start to acquire this terrible ability. Aura is 16, she is born on the day of the Shift and has a side-job as a translator for ghosts in court cases. One horrible day, her boyfriend Logan, a pre-shifter musician on the verge of stardom, suddenly dies and the life she knew starts to crumble to pieces, revealing a series of mysteries that are destined to change her life for good.I chose to read Shade because the ratings were pretty high and the reviews extremely good but, as I started it, I was immediately annoyed:- new mysterious guy in school? Check.- heroine with paranormal abilities? Check.- love triangle (though with a ghost)? Check.- science project? Bloody check.Yes, another of THOSE books.Furthermore, I thought the ghost thing going SHADE was a bit lame. FYI, a ghost goes shade when he becomes bitter and can't solve things he left unresolved in life and, apparently, makes post-shifters pass out and go out of their mind. Shades are captured by the shady (HA!) ghost police by means of a magic medallion and trapped, ghostbuster-like, in a little black box. If you don't want a ghost to haunt you in your bathroom while you're sitting in the toilet, you have to line it with obsidian. Mh....My main problem with this book is that I had a hard time liking Aura. When Logan dies, she seems to get over it very quickly, thinking too soon about Zachary. It made me want to strangle her. Your boyfriend dies, for god's sake, where is the grief, the mourning?? I just kept thinking what a selfish b!tch she was, feeling attracted to Zachary and drawing star charts with him mere days after Logan's death. Unreal. Now, not liking your main character is not exactly a good sign in a book.But then, as I read on, I started to realize that I actually like the rather darker nuance that this book has: there's drugs, there's drinking, not everything is perfect in these guys lives and I felt more and more connected to the characters. It felt a bit more like my teenage years, rather than the usual loveatfirstsight, illloveyouforeverandever routine.Thankfully there's quite a bit of character development also on Aura's side and I gradually started to rethink my opinion on her, even though I am still not completely convinced. I'm leaving her with the benefit of doubt for further developments. There are quite a few threads left unsolved in this book, the mysteries surrounding Aura and Zachary's births are still pretty much undisclosed and so is Logan's role in the matter but I really think I'll pick up the next book in this series. For me it wasn't bad at all, oscillating between a 1 and 2 stars for the first part but a solid 4 stars as the story developed. So I'm giving it a 3 and I hope that, from here on, the story will only get better. Second installment Shift came out this month.

She wonders why the Shift actually happened in the first place, and she wishes that she could reverse it so she could live without having to listen to ghosts tell her their stories or demand justice all the time.When her boyfriend Logan suddenly dies, Aura is devastated. But because of the Shift, she finds herself able to talk with him, spend time with him, and pretend that he's still truly here with her. With the new boy, Zachary, being so supportive of everything that's going on, her feelings become conflicted and she's not sure if she really wants to be with Logan anymore. The idea of many people being able to see ghosts seemed very original to me. Upon reading this book, I can say that I was very interested in the theories that Aura had concerning the Shift, and I want to know what caused it! I think that was my favourite part about this book. However, I feel like the way that the world had evolved after the Shift didn't seem to really add up to me. I understand taking measures to keep ghosts out of public areas, I understand making new police or government forces to keep ghosts in line. But the way that people acted when their loved ones died seemed not to match up with what they had discovered.You'd think that after learning that ghosts and an afterlife of sorts exists, people would be calmer concerning death. Yet, the culture surrounding death didn't really change, people still found themselves absolutely devastated and stuck on their personal beliefs surrounding death. This didn't make sense to me, and unfortunately it made the world that Aura lived in seem a little less real to me. Aside from that, I found it unrealistic how quickly Aura developed a crush on another guy after her boyfriend passes away. I mean, not only is she upset about his death, but she actually can still hang out with him and have some sort of relationship with him. So why would she start having all these feelings for Zachary? She barely knows him, yet she's getting butterflies in his presence. Meanwhile, she supposedly loves Logan with all her heart, and he's still there! This didn't add up to me either.I'm not sure if I'll read the sequel, but I might decide to because I want to know more about the Shift! As I mentioned, this was the best aspect of the book, in my opinion. I can only hope that the world and character's relationships will start to make more sense to me in the next book. If you want a book about ghosts with original ideas, you'll like this one. If you're interested in romantic YA books, this novel is for you."}, {"userName": "~Tina~", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2594672-tina", "userReview": "(3.5 stars)Wow! Now this is supernatural on a whole new level!!Since the Shift, everyone under the age of sixteen can see and talk to ghost who haven't passed over. Aura is one of them, and while it may be slightly annoying, it's something she's learn to deal with.So what happens when her beloved boyfriend Logan, who got the break of his life on his birthday, suddenly dies and becomes a ghost in all his violet glory?Aura has to convince him to move on before he becomes a Shade, only she may not have the heart to let him go...After reading SHADE, I felt really...torn. I didn't hate it, but I also didn't love it and I think that's where the rub comes in. I liked it, a lot, but my expectations were a little to high for this one and while I thought it was amazing, I had a hard time understand some of the terminology, significance of the scene and the actions that the characters portrayed. I didn't quite grasp this at once, so while this was an enjoyable experience, it was also mind baffling to say the least.The plot was one crazy-brilliant concept to a very unique look at this particular supernatural paranormal and Jeri Smith-Ready completely owned it!Shades, Shifts, post-shifts, pre-shifts, PSAT's, DMP, MI-X and Obsidian, are only a few terms that will blow your mind in this world. Don't get me wrong here, I thought it was outrageously original and I applaud that, but at the same time I felt like I was walking on fuzzy the entire time I was reading and wished it was delivered a bit more clearly. I understood the initial nature of this book by the very end, but it didn't flow well while reading.Aura, Logan and Zack were a heartbreaking mix between haunting and longing. They were fleshed out characters who have a tremendous amount of heart and soul.I love, love, Logan! So tortured and unsure and there was a lot of sweet tender moments that tugged at my heart between him and Aura that made this even more bittersweet! But, while there is a love triangle here, it felt more like a circle going round and round.The writing is remarkable and I read this in one sitting. I clung to the pages in this wondrous world and even though there are still a lot of unanswered questions I look forward to reading the sequel as soon as it comes out!!!All in all, I thought that Shade was mind-boggling brilliant, freshly original and masterfully creative. Highly entertaining!

I'll explain. The problem is that it's centered around a really interesting and comprehensively drawn ghost mythology. It made sense in context of the story, it was internally consistent, and it was a really cool idea. I loved the way Smith-Ready had the world remake itself around ghosts that everyone under the age of sixteen can see. How a ghost can testify in a wrongful death case when he's the victim? That's pretty cool.And most of the characters are complex and realistic. Most of them are experiencing some form of grief, and the way it's written is really good. When Logan dies, half of his family can see his ghost, and half of them can't. Which would be harder? To be the one who can keep talking to an insubstantial version of a loved one, or the one left out of that conversation? I loved how Smith-Ready showed that both would be incredibly hard, in different ways. So why does this book make me angry? Simply put, it's Zachary. I hate love triangles in general anyways, but this one in particular is terribly, horribly out of place. In a book that's meant to be about Aura's struggle to grieve the death of a loved one who isn't actually gone, the introduction of another boy is just a distraction. This would be true even if I found Zachary dreamy, and honestly I don't like him at all. Not even his Scottish accent can interest me in him. It doesn't ruin this particular book, but the writing is on the wall for future books. I don't want to see any more of him or this love triangle, so I don't think I'll continue on with the series. And that's why I'm angry, because a really promising concept is going on the wayside because of a love triangle that includes a character I dislike."}, {"userName": "Jena", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4021022-jena", "userReview": "Wow. Just wow! Shade is a whirlwind of emotions in one book. Love. Is all I can say.Shade starts off with Aura, who since the shift can see ghosts. Aura is special though, she was first. That doesn't stop her life though, or her love for her amazing, sexy, singer boyfriend Logan. So when Logan tragically dies she's thinks it's all over, until she realizes that Logan is still with her in ghost form. As more mysteries unravel, she becomes close to Zachary, a green eyed, Scottish cutie. Together they begin to figure out what the Shift is all about. What do you do when you're in love with your ghost boyfriend, but someone else is willing to be there for you?I loved this book. The story was fantastic. And I really, really want to know more about the Shift and Aura's mother. Another aspect I loved about this book was the music. I adore music. It's one of my favorite things in the world. There always seems to be a lyric for every situation and every emotion. The fact that Logan sang, and played guitar killed me. I wanted to jump right on him haha! And Zachary's song was I Will Posses Your Heart? Hellloooo amazing.I loved every character in this book. Well with the exception of Brian, Becca, and Nadine. I loved the Keeley brothers and Megan! Aura was something else. I really ached with her. I know what it's like to love someone and also have someone in the background saying 'hey! I'm here for you. I'll catch you when you fall.' It's the worst decision in the world. One to this day, I haven't made. And honestly my heart aches for Aura for having to chose between two amazing guys. As of right now... I adore both boys. Zachary is such a sweety and he has green eyes, which is a killer for me. Green eyes are my favorite! He's so willing to do anything for Aura and be there for her when she needs him. But, I am a tiny bit more a Logan girl <3. I love that Logan sings, plays guitar, is so into music, is cute, sweet, and how he loves Aura more than anything in the world. This book is so much more than romance. It dives into drugs, parties, music, school, how cruel people can really be, and how much people will do for love.I'm really rooting that somehow Logan and Aura end up together. I just don't see how it will happen though. Here's hoping! :) If not, Zachary is still a keeper and I adore him too!This book was amazing! Definetely worth a buy!! I cannot wait for the sequel i neeeeeeed more!!! Most importantly... Always fight for what you want and don't give up. Believe in music. Believe in yourself. Believe in love.

I think the ghost probably scared Aurora more than she wanted to admit, there were some harsh truths in the words.Merged review:I really loved this book, for me it didn't really read as a YA/Teen book as the subject matter is pretty weighty. What I found most intriguing about this book was the world and the way it was set up. In this world, something happened during the winter solstice 16 years ago. This shift makes everyone note the time in pre-shift or post-shift. Those that have been born post-shift can see ghosts and interact with them. The ghosts for the most part are good and need help to move on, but sometimes they shade and become evil. This new reality in a post-shift world makes new government agencies dealing with the ghosts a necessity. This group, the DMP, goes to all the high school to recruit the first \"class\" of post-shifters pretty regularly. With the shift there must be a \"first\" and \"last\" shift children. Aura, a post-shifter, lives her life as normal as she can, she works for her aunt in a law firm and often is a translator for ghosts in court, has a boyfriend, Logan a pre-shifter, who is a musician. Things seem to be going great for her until Logan dies and then things change very much for Aura. The things that she experienced in a clinical matter in court becomes very real with all sorts of hidden agendas becoming apparent. This book was filled with intrigue, all of the characters hiding secrets, and a surprising twist at the end.

Where you don't see the last page coming because you just want it to keep on going... where you read the last sentence and immediately need the next novel... 'wow'I really think Shade, as a paranormal novel, is going to stand out among the throngs of vampire, werewolf, and angel books. Although this isn't the first novel I've read about ghosts, the story is incredibly unique and well done. Plus it has that whole incredibly hot love triangle going on, which is something that I can't get enough of for some reason. And for once I don't have a definite side that I'm on.Aura is a really well developed character and as a reader you can't help but get caught up in the emotional battle that she struggles with throughout this novel. Aura's character has a very compelling and relatable voice, and I think readers will automatically like her. I know I did. And the boys in this novel, wow. Hot guitar playing rock-star...er ghost, or a seriously sexy Scotsman....?The whole mystery surrounding 'the shift' isn't really divulged upon in this novel. No one really knows what caused it, and the people that are trying to find an answer really only have assumptions.

All she has ever wanted is for them to leave her alone - that is until her boyfriend Logan dies. She'd rather have Logan's ghost in her life than lose Logan completely but it isn't easy having a boyfriend who you can't touch - can't kiss. Then Aura meets Zachary, a new student at her school who has been assigned to help her with her history project. Aura is investigating the mystery of what caused the Shift and Zachary has information that could help her if she can get him to open up and tell her everything. Logan's family want to help Logan move on but is Aura ready to let him go? Can she move on with her life when Logan's ghost is still with her?I've heard great things about Shade from US bloggers so I was really excited when I received a review copy from Simon & Schuster. Jeri Smith-Ready has created an interesting world that had me hooked from the very beginning. I read a lot of paranormal stories so I really enjoyed this refreshing twist on the genre - I loved the idea of the Shift and the fact that only people born afterwards have the ability to see ghosts. I can't imagine how hard it would be to have that ability but Jeri did a great job of describing it to us. There is a lot of mystery surrounding the cause of the Shift, it doesn't seem like anyone really knows what caused it - if the government has any ideas they are keeping them secret! - but this adds to the story and I like the fact that we are finding out information alongside Aura.Logan was a great character - a fledgling rock star who is on the verge of signing a record deal with his band The Keely Brothers (who both his brother & sister also play for) when a stupid drunken mistake ends his life. The scenes of his death were heartbreaking and you really feel not only his pain and anger over what happened but also Aura & his family's suffering. The differences in the way the pre-shifters and the post-shifters (who can still see Logan) deal with their grief was well defined and interesting to read. How hard must it be to move on with life if you can still talk to the person you lost? Would it be worse to be one of the people who can't see them when others around you can and refuse to act as if they have gone? I really can't decide if I'd want to be one of the people who could still see Logan or one of the ones that couldn't!Aura and the other teenagers in the story were well written and realistic they aren't perfect, they drink underage and have sexual relationships but none of this is glorified and I think you'll find a lot teens of their age act in a similar way. I found Aura very easy to relate to especially with her mixed feelings about Logan and Zachary - she was in a difficult situation and I really felt for her. While we're on the subject of Zachary I have to say I loved him. He is so supportive of Aura and understanding about how she feels but he also knows what he wants and is prepared to work hard to get it. He is keeping secrets from Aura and although she finds out some of them throughout the book I have a feeling there will be more to come in the sequel.Overall I found Shade a thoroughly enjoyable read and would highly recommend it to fans of young adult paranormal stories. Be warned that there is quite a cliff hanger at the end - I definitely want to get my hands on book 2 (Shift) as soon as possible. We still have a lot to learn about the cause of the Shift and I'm really looking forward to finding out more. Don't let the cliff hanger put you off though - it is well worth reading Shade & I'd recommend adding it to your buy list and getting hold of a copy as soon as you can."}, {"userName": "Lisa (A Life Bound By Books)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2001477-lisa-a-life-bound-by-books", "userReview": "5 Stars - I\u2019ve been trying to write this review for a couple days now and the words just don\u2019t want to come to me. Not because this book was bad, it was far from it. It was amazing. It\u2019s not often that I find a book that I love a much as this one \u2013 examples of books that fall in this same category for me would be Shiver, The Twilight Saga and handful of other books out there. From the dark, beautiful and mysterious cover to the fact that anyone born post Shift can see and talk to ghosts\u2026. To our main characters, Aura, Logan and Zachary everything just flowed and fit together like every great story should.When Aura\u2019s boyfriend Logan dies it\u2019s hard not to feel for both of them as the emotions of what their each going through almost jump off the page. Seeing him come back as a ghost was a different kind of pain that only any post Shift born would understand. She\u2019s a strong character with a strong voice, and watching her struggle and deal with the aftermath of Logan\u2019s death was tough with all those emotions that come through on each page. My heart ached for her and Logan often throughout the story and I\u2019m sure anyone who loved or will fall in love with this book as I have will understand.Then we have Zachary, the new student at school who just moved from Scotland who is patient and kind and helps to take Aura\u2019s mind off of things for a while. During their time together working on a school project about Megaliths, she\u2019s able to find some peace from how painful life has become since Logan's death. With this project, Aura is secretly trying to solve a mystery of just how or what or even who might have created the Shift in the first place. All she knows is that there has to be a reason and won\u2019t stop until she finds the answers she\u2019s looking for.See, that\u2019s where the mystery part of the story comes in. No one knows how it happened or why it happened, just that one day the world was normal and then the next POOF anyone born after said date and time can see and talk to Ghosts. With a Ghost of the person you love the most trying to deal with his death at the same time you are, Aura was bound to have mixed emotions over Logan and Zachary. Which then finds them in the never prefect, often heartbreaking Love triangle. It was hard to pick or choose who Aura should end up with since I loved both boys\u2026 well as equally as you can love them both when ones a ghost. The end left us with a HUGE cliffhanger on many different levels, and left me asking more questions. I had a feeling there was one around the corner since there was still so much to learn about when it comes to our characters and then I mean the Shift itself, but those last couple lines in the book\u2026 WOW, huge! For me even a little bit epic. I mean yeah, I loved this book THAT much. Smith-Ready has made a fan out of me, I can\u2019t wait to read her other books and then see what happens in this series from her when the sequel \u2013 Shift comes out\u2026. But that\u2019s not until May 2011. I have a long time to wait and wonder where she\u2019ll lead us next in her characters lives. Now, I have to say that if this was one of those books for you that has caught your eye, don\u2019t pass it up when it hits the bookshelves in May. I think after many read there will be much more love of this series found, looking forward to hearing what you guys all think, Happy Reading.For more info and reviews please visit my Book Review Blog here - A Life Bound By Books"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5028591-andrea", "userReview": "In One Word ~ OverwhelmingHonestly, one word could never do SHADE justice. It was also: Astonishing, Shattering, Breathtaking, Beautiful, Funny, and Sad. Does that just about cover it? Not a chance.I debated writing this review. In some weird way, I wanted to take SHADE and the emotions it drug through me and just hold them tightly to myself, keep it private. Mine. But then I thought about the massive, and I mean MASSIVE amount of conversation that was started on Twitter with me simply saying that I was starting SHADE. People I \"talk\" with on a daily basis, occasionally, and never before responded. We all had this happy, hilarious and passionate conversation. It was about the books, the characters, whose Team we were on (I'm still officially on what Jeri calls \"Team ShadeBoys\", I love them both), kilts, music, kisses, and tears. When a book can inspire that kind of commitment and intensity, you know that you've come across something that sort of transcends... well, it just transcends being simply a book. I realized that SHADE is the type of book that binds people. People who would have never laughed, or squee'd with happiness or even talked to one another have become linked by their love for this series and the author, Jeri Smith-Ready.Oh yeah, this was supposed to be a review. I guess I should be writing reviewer-ish stuff, huh? SHADE is full of everything that makes a fabulous book. Engaging, smart, smartass, beautifully infuriating characters. SHADE has a extremely unique, well-developed plot that involves our world, with a slight tweak that seems entirely possible. Like, I was really looking around for violet-hued figures, lurking in the background.I read SHADE while traveling twelve, count em, twelve hours with my cranky husband and lovable but really whiny kids. I zoomed through this book in about two and a half hours. The tears started leaking as soon as I opened it. I cried the entire time. But don't get me wrong, SHADE is also a super funny book. The dialogue is amazing, so funny and sarcastic, just how I like it.SHADE gave me a really, really good day. Every time I look at this book, I will remember Logan, Aura, and Zach; crying in a car with a box of tissues on my lap; and my brilliant friends who made me feel as if they were reading it for the first time, with me.Favorite Quote ~\u201cAura,\" he whispered, \"I wish I could wipe away just one of your tears.

I kept meaning to but then it kept getting pushed back. I am so glad I finally buckled down and got it. I seriously balled my eyes out! What an emotional roller coaster!Everyone born after the Shift can see ghosts. Aura was born one minute after the Shift, about sixteen years ago. Aura works for her aunt helping out with ghost rights but she is rather annoyed by ghosts. She wishes she could end the Shift. But when Logan, her boyfriend and the love of all her life dies on his birthday, she begins to see the importance of ghost rights.Oh how I loved Logan! He was the sweetest and cutest thing ever and just broke my heart into a million pieces. Everything he said to Aura drove me to the tissue box. Poor thing made one bad decision on his birthday that ended his life. He is now stuck as a violet colored ghost, only able to haunt the places he has already visited. He can't touch Aura or play his guitar or even talk to his parents since they were born before the Shift. This angers him and when ghosts get angry they risk turning Shade. Every quote said to Aura was so sweet and beautiful. I felt the love between these characters so deeply. I found their relationship realistic and heartwarming. Aura is upset but feels like he is almost still with her. He hangs out in her room every night and they talk. But Aura can't touch him and her hot new research partner, Zach, is not helping matters. Zach is also super suspicious because it turns out Zach was born one minute before Aura and the Shift. Zach seems to know more about Aura than he first let on. Zach is sweet and patient. He is there supporting Aura hoping to move in on her. I do enjoy his character but Logan is clearly the guy for Aura.Logan is not handling life after death and Aura's new shiny research partner well. He is at risk of turning Shade which has alerted the government. The government traps and holds dangerous ghosts. Logan wants to allow Aura and his family to move on so he decides it is time for him to move on. But when a ghost moves on before it is ready there can be consequences.

There, many things that are impossible for us are made believable in Shade's setting.

Kind of.Going into this book, I didn't expect to be that impressed. The reviews were pretty mixed and it just didn't seem all that interesting. But, I always give into hype and I consider this series to be one of the most hyped YA series' out there, so I gave it a shot. It turned out to be a very entertaining read.In the world of this book, something happened several years ago called the Shift, and it causes everyone who was born after that event to be able to see violet-hued ghosts, and also Shades, the evil and darker kind of these ghosts. Aura was the very first girl born after the Shift. She's annoyed by the ghosts constantly wanting help from her, and she just wants to spend time with her boyfriend Logan. But on the night of his birthday, just when Aura thought the night was going to be perfect, Logan unexpectedly dies. Aura's still able to talk to him and see him\u2014albeit as a violet-hued spirit\u2014but it just doesn't feel the same anymore because they can't touch. Meanwhile Aura is paired with Zachary, a new foreign exchange-student from Scotland to research the Shift for a class project, and Aura can't deny her growing attraction to him and his sexy Scottish accent. Yet she still can't let go of her love for Logan.I thought the whole Shift concept was pretty unique. Basically people that are sixteen or under are able to see ghosts. The ghosts in this book are violet-hued, but there are also the Shades, the evil and powerful ones that are built on rage. Regular ghosts can turn into Shades if they stay in the living world for too long and don't pass on. I did like the supernatural aspect a lot in this book, and how ghosts were a very common and unusual thing.The characters were also very likable. Especially Logan. God, he was so awesome. That's why I was so pissed when Aura showed signs of moving on from him so quickly. She was already extremely hot for Zachary, the new guy who's painfully hot and has a Scottish accent. Out of all the characters in the book, I would say Aura was the least likable, just due to the fact that I can't believe Aura would be hot for another guy so quickly, because Logan was amazing.Okay yes, maybe you shouldn't spend forever just being sad if your boyfriend dies and obsess and cry over him til you die yourself. But I was bothered by how she was so quick to be wanting to be all over Zach. If she really loved Logan she wouldn't be constantly daydreaming about some other extremely hot guy just a few days after his death. Scottish accent or not.But I will say that Aura and Zach's romance could've been a lot worse. At least they never actually officially dated in the book. They kissed, yeah, and it kinda bothered me how heated it was. If they weren't interrupted they probably would've been jumping each others' bones already. But I do admit that Aura still cared about Logan and still thought of him a lot. Even towards the end, surprisingly.But during the second half of the book, Aura was just way too hot for Zachary, and I wasn't having it. Zachary himself was an okay character, I guess. I was too in love with Logan to even care about him, to be honest. I still think their romance moved a little too fast for my taste, mainly during the middle parts of the book. I was glad that it slowed down again nearing the end, though, and that saved me from giving the book a three star rating.Anyways, now let's talk about the ending, which I don't even want to call an \"ending\" because I had to double check if the last few pages weren't ripped out or something. I mean, what the fuck kind of ending was THAT? It's not even a cliffhanger, it's like the writing was cut off or something. That was just cruel of the author to do that. Luckily I own the second book already and just started it. If I'd read this book when the sequel still wasn't out, I would've been pissed the hell off.In short, I thought this book was very enjoyable with a pretty cool concept and likable characters, but the protagonist and the romance bothered me and made me unable to give the book a five star rating, I'll definitely continue the series though. After an ending like that, I'd be surprised if anyone didn't want to get the sequel straight away."}, {"userName": "Jess (Gone with the Words)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3082567-jess-gone-with-the-words", "userReview": "Read this review on my blog! --> Shade by Jeri Smith-ReadyShade was a book I saw on the shelves last year that I was not compelled to buy. I was just never curious enough about it. It wasn\u2019t until this year, right before Shift (the second book in this series) was released that I noticed my fellow reader\u2019s excitement. Then I bought it on sale, and there it sat, on my shelves...still not read. When I mentioned to Ginger of GReads! that I had Shade but hadn\u2019t read it yet, she insisted I needed to read it and even lent me her copy of Shift (Thanks, Ginger!). This book. THIS BOOK! Why did I wait so long to read it?! Shade is unlike anything I\u2019ve read as of yet. I mean...the boyfriend is a ghost! Yes, I know he hasn\u2019t always been a ghost, but you can\u2019t argue the unique predicament they\u2019re in. And with all the true love, undeniable musical talent, and charming personality Logan has, will it be enough to compete with the flesh-and-blood Scottish hotness that is Zachary?? Well if Aura can\u2019t choose, I sure as heck can\u2019t! I\u2019ll keep them both. :) I loved (LOVED) all the musical mentions in this book. How did Jeri Smith-Ready know I have a soft spot for Celtic punk music?? The Pogues and Flogging Molly? Yes, please! I always say I\u2019m Irish in my heart and I celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day more than Cinco de Mayo (I\u2019m Mexican, btw). Then, Snow Patrol and Death Cab for Cutie?! OMG, I wanted to crawl in this book and hug everyone! Those two bands twist my little heart like no other. The mystery revolving the Shift and Aura and Zachary is very intriguing. I am beyond curious to see how it all ties together and the significance of it all. Now, the Keeleys; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a family out there who has made me cry more than them. I was just so heartbroken for them! And can I tell you how much I thought I was just like Megan, HAHA. I was like, \u201cDuuuude! I would so say/do that!\u201d I loved her!! Although this book did have some incredibly sweet and sexy moments, it was not a very happy book. It left me feeling melancholy, but not enough to discourage me from reading more. So, friends, it is time for me to leave you, for I have Shift waiting and I don\u2019t think I can take it a moment longer without cracking it open."}, {"userName": "Krys", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2798856-krys", "userReview": "Wow. I\u2019m just\u2026wow. I loved this. It\u2019s one of my favourite reads this year. Wow\u2026 can that be my review? Well, where to start then?Aura has been fighting with her boyfriend, Logan, since almost losing her virginity to him. She hopes to rectify things with him soon. His band, The Keeley Brothers, is scheduled to perform a show soon where two record execs from rival companies are rumoured to show. Aura plans to smooth things over with him that night and give herself to him. Everything seems perfect, until Logan accidentally overdoses and dies\u2026.and reappears before Aura\u2019s eyes as a ghost.In Shade there are what is known as the pre-shifters and the post-shifters; one can see the dead, and one cannot. Aura is young enough to see the dead. She has helped in her Aunt\u2019s law firm for those that wish to testify in trials that will help them move on from our world to the next. She is not afraid of them like the adults are. However, none of that prepares her for the sight of her one true love begging and pleading for forgiveness over the fact that he accidentally killed himself.I can go on, but I will end up giving away the rest of the book. Rest assured, it\u2019s pretty bloody wonderful. How can you go wrong with ghosts, and interrupted love, and old diaries, and star watching, and Irish punk bands, and dreamy Scottish boys, and not letting go, and impossible love triangles, and and and. I loved it. I lapped it all up and held the spoon in my mouth to savour the taste afterwards.It\u2019s pretty much the best thing that has happened to me all day, and I saw a show I\u2019ve been wanting to see live (for over a decade) for the first time today. The book is better than that. Wow. And that says what?I think the strength lies with Jeri Smith-Ready. She\u2019s so cheeky and very good at structuring intense plots with some pretty fabulous ideas. I\u2019ve been a fan of her since reading the WVMP books a while back. This is a sublime effort on her part. A wonderful young adult treat. I fell so in love with all the characters but mostly the three main principles. Aura is the kind of girl I want to drop everything for to go have coffee. Logan, ego and all, had me at hello. But most of all Zachary, the beautiful Scottish boy\u2026 patient, but not a saint. I\u2019m mad for Zachary. He\u2019s a perfect counterpoint to this whole idea. No matter what Aura gives he gives back with a flourish. I loved the dialogue between them. I loved this book. I have very little to complain about. It was pretty damn wonderful.5 of 5 stars.

You rush through a page just so you can turn it quickly to see what happens next? Then you have to turn back just to read it again and make sure you didn't miss anything? Well that is this book! I will say that it has been a while since I have read a book that made me feel so many different emotions at once. While reading this on my kindle I took notes along the way. Here is what I wrote \"Full of romance, mystery, and suspense. Heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time! Makes you want to flip the pages faster; then you need to catch your breath. Some parts I would laugh out loud, then get teary eyed at the next page\". I had to makes notes just so I could remember every detail; every emotion along the way. So how can a book do all of this at once? An amazing author! Jeri Smith-Ready knows what it takes to grab a reader. From the beginning, Aura comes off as such an interesting character. She's beautiful, funny, smart, caring, and has been through a great deal of bad situations. She was the first (literally) born after the Shift, or the time when people can now see ghosts. Everyone born after the shift can see, hear, and talk to ghosts. Everyone born before, cannot. They have learned to live with this but it all has a new meaning once Aura's boyfriend Logan dies. Aura is faced with the reality of a haunted spirit and has to deal with all of the problems and emotions that go along with it. After she meets a new guy in town, Zachary, she learns that maybe she can move on and love again. But is she ready? And what is that connection they seem to share automatically? This book will keep you guessing! Through Zachary's friendship and support Aura tries to figure out how to help Logan, without losing herself along the way. Even with all of the complications from Logan and Zachary, Aura is on another quest to find out the secrets her mother kept hidden, and how those secrets are related to her birth and the Shift.I can't say enough good things about Shade. If you pick up one new book this month, pick this one! This was my birthday gift to myself (since it came out on my birthday, May 4th) and I must say that I could not have picked a better gift!"}, {"userName": "FreakChiq", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3530772-freakchiq", "userReview": "It was the big finale of the YA Crush Tournament (hosted by The YA Sisterhood) and Jace was up against someone I\u2019ve never heard of before\u2014a Scotsman named Zachary Moore. I was sure the win was already ours. I mean, it\u2019s Jace we\u2019re talking about, and we, Jace fans, love him as much as he loves Clary, if not even more. But what I believed would be an easy-peasy match, turned into an exciting and intense duel that made me really curious. Who is this guy that has so many devoted fans? I needed to find out more about him. So I finally picked up Shade. To be honest, I knew Zach won\u2019t be no Jace even before I began reading. However, Zach has some pretty crush-worthy qualities of his own. I don\u2019t mean just his Scottish accent and his good looks. He\u2019s a guy that knows exactly what he wants and is not afraid to go for it. I really, truly liked that about him. And I swear a piece of me fell in love with him when he explained to Aura why \u201cI Will Possess Your Heart\u201d is his favorite song. So yeah, getting to know Zachary Moore was totally worth it! But Shade has a lot more to offer than just the handsome Scotsman. True, there are a lot of Guy/Girl-sees-ghosts stories out there, but most of them (at least the ones I\u2019ve read) have something, a unique-ish approach or a clever twist, that makes them stand out. Shade has the Shift. The Shift is an event that occurred during winter solstice 16 years ago, one minute before Aura was born. Nobody knows what caused it or why ever since then the post-Shift born can hear and see ghosts. But Aura is determined to find out the truth. She has a feeling megaliths (like Stonehenge) have something to do with it. I really enjoyed reading about the stones and their possible connection to the Shift. But this is by far not the only mystery that will grab your attention and keep you hooked to the end.If you like good paranormal stories that have a great premise, wonderful characters and big mysteries that will keep you guessing, you should totally give Shade a try. But be prepared for a HUGE cliffhanger."}, {"userName": "Yani", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3079736-yani", "userReview": "I started this blog last December, but before that I was so busy with school that I wasn't really reading many blogs either. So I guess around that time the world was buzzing about this book, and oblivious me didn't know anything about it until I got an ARC copy of Shift (book 2). With so many great books in my reading pile I put the ARC aside and thought to myself, \"if I don't get to it that's okay.\" NO definitely not okay!! I am so glad my twitter pals where talking about this book, because it made me purchase a copy from Amazon and start reading it right away. And once I started I couldn't stop!If you are a fan of the mediator series, like I am, you will enjoy this book. It has a lot of the same elements such as the mystery behind the powers that allow to see ghosts. But while Meg's books are all about the character building, Jeri series also has a lot of world building as well. It has a different premise than most ghost books I have read, the fact that there was an even \"The Shift\" that causes not just one but a the entire population after said event to see ghosts it intriguing.And I loved Aura and the two boys she was torn between. Sometimes in these love triangle situations you just want to hit the person over the head and scream PICK ONE!! But Aura, she never gets annoying, you understand where she is coming from. It is hard to move on with the past staring you in the face. Also, in the mediator series I was a big Jesse (the ghost) fan, so obviously I connected with Logan. But Zachary was just such a sweet guy. I was torn, so I could see how Aura could be torn too.I really LOVED this book and Shift even more, but I will get to that later. I highly recommend if you like mystery, paranormal, and amazing reads!!"}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "Shade possesses all the qualities a good young adult paranormal book should have: a strong protagonist, an interesting premise, some suspense, and a touch (or in this case, a lot of touches) of romance.The book is about Aura, one of the many sixteen-year-old teens born after the Shift. The Shift marks when babies began to see ghosts, in the form of purple clouds. Once the ghosts become angered, they turn into violent shades with the capability of damaging anyone born post-Shift.On the night of her boyfriend's birthday, Aura planned to go all the way. In an unfortunate twist of events her boyfriend, Lucas, ends up passing away and returning as a ghost. Now she has to decide whether she wants Lucas to stay and haunt her, with the possibility of becoming a shade himself, or pass on - hopefully to heaven. Then comes Zachary, a foreign exchange student Aura's teacher designated to help her with her history project. Zachary is everything Logan is not: visible to everyone, touchable, and completely alive. Who will Aura choose?Shade impressed me by creating a compelling love triangle without being pretentious. I am looking forward to the sequel and I hope the government's involvement in detaining the shades is further explained."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "Everyone born after the shift can see ghosts.

There is something different about Zachary. What is Zachary hiding?I have wanted to try out author, Jeri Smith Ready for a while. I decided to start with Mrs. Smith Ready\u2019s young adult paranormal series. Shade is book one. This book is a ghost story but not a scary ghost story. More like a love story. I liked Aura. She was cool. She is like a typical teenager only she has the ability to see and speak to ghosts. I liked Aura and Logan together, even though I didn\u2019t really get to know Logan. Zachary was nice. Though at times it seemed like Zachary was desperate to tag along with Aura, so he would than seem like not much of a love interest for Aura.
