The recently revived series on FOX averaged 4.6 million viewers on its first episode. Indeed, the title itself conjures up thoughts of fantastic stories that bridge several forms of fiction to create a unique genre of morality tales with a touch of irony, unlimited by the boundaries of conventional fiction. Broadcast from 1959 to 1964, the show has run ever since in syndication, making it one of the longest running television shows of all time, creating a new genre of shows similar to the X-Files and Twin Peaks. Five writers created the core of the show, and together these men fashioned the bulk of the 156 original episodes: Rod Serling, Richard Matheson, Charles Beaumont, George Clayton Johnson, and Earl Hamner. All went on to other projects in film, television, theater, and print, but their involvement in the Twilight Zone is well known to fans of the series. The Twilight Zone Scripts of Earl Hamner contains reprints of the eight episodes written by Hamner, along with Albarella's commentary on each story: The Hunt, \" \"A Piano in the House, \" \"Jess-Belle, \" \"Ring-a-Ding Girl, \" \"You Drive, \" \"Black Leather Jackets, \" \"Stopover in a Quiet Town, \" and \"The Bewitchin' Pool.\" Also included is a \"lost\" Twilight Zone short story by Mr. Hamner and an interview with Albarella that covers the background details of how Hamner became involved in the series.\"", "title": "The Twilight Zone Scripts of Earl Hamner", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232297.The_Twilight_Zone_Scripts_of_Earl_Hamner", "average": 4.57, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1172945460l/232297.jpg", "reviews": 5, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6859638.Earl_Hamner_Jr_", "name": "Earl Hamner Jr."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/135942.Tony_Albarella", "name": "Tony Albarella"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232297.The_Twilight_Zone_Scripts_of_Earl_Hamner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2402548.Spencer_s_Mountain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12128.The_Homecoming", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827207.Goodnight_John_Boy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685047-earl-hamner-jr-bestsellers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1148739.Avocado_Drive_Zoo"]}
