Vampires (not the sparkling kind): they are the predators feeding on humans. They have to be very careful who they kill not to attract attention to themselves, which becomes very difficult at modern times as everybody stays connected to somebody practically 100% of times. So when a zombie apocalypse begins vampires initially rejoice: there is no need to hide now that the humanity has more pressing matters than to hunt an occasional vampire. Everything was fun and dandy (from vampires point of view) until the blood suckers began to realize that their only source of food - the humanity - is about to be exterminated by zombies. Zombies became very popular in the media lately. I do not even need to mention the popularity of vampires. How comes this is the first time I see zombies vs. vampires theme? I mean, the creative possibilities are endless and the plot practically begs to be made into a blockbuster movie. If you think this graphic novel has to be extremely gory because of the subject presented, you are completely correct. There is blood on practically every single page. I did not think there were any very deep subjects raised in here, but as a mindless entertainment the comic delivers. I practically cheered when vampires finally started to kick butts: it took them a while.As a conclusion: if you can stomach lots of gore, and want mindless and still very satisfying entertainment, go for it: you will not be disappointed.

I saw Max Brooks at a signing last year, and he had these little promo cards with The Extinction Parade cover art on them, which he signed. He told us the concept behind the story, a rather unique take on the zombie apocalypse. Wow, I was psyched and ready to dive in!I was a little let down. I mean, the art is fantastic, and I still love the concept. Plus, the vampires don't suck. Well, I mean they do, but no more than they're supposed to.Lots of buildup. Lots of ambiance and mood setting. So, I'm ready to see some kick ass stuff, and then it ends. I guess we'll have to wait until Volume 2 to see where this is going, eh?That's cool. I'll check it out. I'm intrigued.EDIT 5/9/14: After posting this review, I found out that what I had read was in fact half of the upcoming graphic novel. Where I thought it was issues 1-5, it seems it was only 1-3. Yes, this is clearly indicated on the NetGalley site, but I tend to avoid reading blurbs too carefully, for fear of spoilers.That said, my review stands as rated. Sadly, I probably would have rated it higher had I been able to get the whole story (at least through the first story arc) rather than a sample. I was left hanging without closure, so my rating reflects that. Hopefully I'll get a chance to read the whole thing at some point.Note to the publisher: Samples won't get you the best reviews for your product.

I was pretty late on the bandwagon with World War Z, although the movie did nothing to help this. When I finally read World War Z however I was entranced. I have read a lot of zombie fiction and this was first class.When I met him at the convention he was promoting a new comic book of his called \" The Extinction Parade\", about a vampire in the midst of the zombie apocalypse. While I had faith that this unconventional premise would be fun, I had quickly depleted my funds that day and unfortunately could not pick this up. I went home and forgot all about this quirky comic.Fast forward to today when I found this gem on Netgalley. I can confidently say that all is now well in the world. This comic is awesome, and admittedly more gory than I expected. Not necessarily a bad thing, but be forewarned.The main character had me torn, on one hand I found her infinity interesting but on the other I was disgusted with her way of life. However perhaps it's time we had more traditional, evil vampires rather than the currently popular Twilight variety.Admittedly I don't read a lot of comics but this one was worth reading, I can't wait to pick up the next installment.

This has some nice stuff about the mortals who take care of the vampires, since apparently they're all too busy going around all careless & lazy & gore-streaked to handle their income portfolios or short duration funds so they need \"solbreeders\" to do this for them. I'm not sure I quite get the point of killing zombies to save the humans but then killing the humans who saw you kill the zombies - you know? Since you're trying to keep the humans alive?

What fills the pages are grotesque scenes of them and zombies feeding on humans. This and the almost nude scenes of many well-formed women make this no book for kids.

I've read The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z cover to cover numerous times, and I'm always impressed with the way he writes. This man knows his zombies, and he shows it. So when I saw his name on the cover of this graphic novel? I had to read it. It wasn't even a choice, it was a necessity.True to form, Brooks has once again changed up the zombie apocalypse story line. This time the \"subdead\" are front and center, but there are no human survivors. No small packs of people fighting for their lives. Instead, our main characters are two female vampires who are used to a life of luxury. They've seen the world change, they've gotten comfortable with the way things work, and then suddenly there's a wrench in their lives. What does a vampire do when there are no more victims? When zombies are the new rulers of the Earth?I loved the story line concept, but sadly I wasn't a fan of the execution. I say this a lot, but illustrations have a ton to do with my interest in a graphic novel. In order to draw me in, a graphic novel has to marry the writing and the illustrations together in perfect harmony. That being said, my biggest complaint about The Extinction Parade: Vol 1 was actually the illustrations. They were so stylized, so glitzy. As much as I think that absolutely relates to the vampires who were front and center, it didn't translate so much to their zombie counterparts. There's a line where zombies stop looking cool, and start looking odd.My other issue was that this first story arc for Volume 1 is so short. It introduces the concept, and then ends before anything actually happens. I felt so disappointed when I reached the end and realized... well, that it was the ending. The whole novel builds anticipation, teasing you with the chance to see what the world would be like when it's vampires vs. zombies, and then it just ends. Leaving me, the reader, rather upset. I'll admit that, yes, I did pout. I was so looking forward to something that just never came.That does mean, however, that I'll probably give Volume 2 a shot. My interest has been piqued enough that I'll likely come back for more. For now, Volume 1 of The Extinction Parade gets three stars."}, {"userName": "Oni", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/197149-oni", "userReview": "This is the review of the short story, \"The Extinction Parade,\" not the graphic novel with the same title that is released later.You can read it for free here:http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles...At last, a new faction joins the zombie war. Believe it or not, the vampires is joining the war. And believe me, this is not another vampire story, not to mention that it is not a regular zombie story either. Max Brooks still use the same story line that he used in World War Z, even though this one is not written interview style. And the war is still ongoing, not an aftermath like WWZ.If you have read World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, you know what you expect from this short story. There is nothing new in the game, Mr. Brook just adds a new perspective, a vampire perspective of the zombie war.The idea is genuine, much better than most vampire hype nowadays. Vampires get involved in the human vs zombie war. It is quite refreshing to see a \"hypothetical\" perspective of a vampire, concerning the recent rise of the undead, given their specific culture and vocabulary.But I am still expecting more, from the perspective of a World War Z veteran. This story seems to lack the irony, the emotion, and the desperation that is felt by WWZ readers. Maybe this is because I am not a vampire myself. I cannot connect easily to the story, like I did for WWZ.Maybe for the graphic novel it would be much better, because of the graphic. It is going to be quite violent, seeing vampires tearing apart zombies, while still hunt for human.PS: Max Brooks definitely needs to get out of his zombie world, if he wants to be a good writer.

For those who have read Max Brooks, you will recognize his particular brand of social commentary underlying the story. Where the rapid infection rate of marginalized groups caused governments to see the outbreak as a third world problem in World War Z, here it is the vampires who are myopically unaware of the impact it will have on their existence. Believing the zombies are no threat because they don't attack vampires shows a clear lack of understanding in how food chains work.

Apex predators who have lived through decades, watching humanity grow and change and feeding on us all the while.

He does an amazing job of getting into the heads of predatory creatures that have lived for centuries, and writing from that lofty point of view.

Rated 1.75 of 5Max Brooks, perhaps best known for his novel World War Z, is playing with zombies again, this time pairing them with another form of fiend -- the vampire.A pair of female, Asian vampires, who've been around for a long time, delight in the uprising of the zombies. \u00a0Watching them slaughter humans who have no chance of escape. \u00a0And because the vampires aren't living, breathing, blood-flowing people, the zombies completely ignore them. \u00a0It's a great time to be a vampire, right? \u00a0Except, just as this book (this collection of the first few issues of the comic book), comes to a conclusion, the vampires begin to realize that the zombies are eating THEIR FOOD! \u00a0Maybe the zombie apocalypse isn't such a great thing for vampires after all!It's a clever enough idea, though certainly not wholly original. \u00a0But because the story is being told from the viewpoint of the vampires, it would help if we could connect with them in some way. \u00a0But we can't, and that, ultimately, is the downfall of this book. \u00a0Humans are being eradicated by the zombie plague. \u00a0Vampires have taken this as an opportunity to not hide in the shadows but to hunt and feed openly. \u00a0And the reader is connected to this story how?The vampires have a servant...someone who cleans up after them...takes care of their feeding left-overs and removes evidence of their existence. \u00a0Though the current servant has been with them for a long time, and they've had a number of servants before him, they don't even know his name. \u00a0These vampires who are telling the story are full of hubris and act like spoiled children, getting everything they want and treating everyone and everything around them like dirt. \u00a0The servant's sudden decision to leave at least adds some mystery to the story and I hope we'll learn more as the series continues.The art reminds me of the hand-colored wood-block prints I've seen in galleries. \u00a0Thick, black inks and solid, bold colors. \u00a0At times this worked very well and at other times it appeared rushed. \u00a0This led to very uneven art look.I am a little curious to see where this goes and to see if a story actually develops. \u00a0The servant's story strikes me as the most interesting now as we've otherwise spent 160 pages of doing the same thing over and over...zombies kill humans, vampires watch and enjoy, vampires kill humans ... repeat. \u00a0I'll be interested enough to pick up the next issue if I can, though if I missed it, I don't feel as though I would have missed out on too much.Looking for a good book?

My first impressions upon flipping through its pages were low, but that's because I didn't (and still don't) care for Raulo Caceres' artwork. It is far too titillating and gory for my (perhaps prudish?) sensibilities, and this graphic novel contains some, well, graphic artwork. Perhaps it is foolish for me to complain about a zombie novel's gory content. After all, zombies need to consume human brains, and they harvest those brains by brute force, so... yeah. It's gory, bloody, nasty stuff. Nevertheless, I didn't care for the style in which this goriness was portrayed. And frankly, the sophomoric and clearly sexist representation of female bodies in the artwork offended me far more than the carnage, but comic book art has a long history of objectifying women. Not that that makes it ok. It doesn't.However, there's more to this novel than semi-erotic zombie gore. There's also sexy vampire gore. Yes, Brooks' imagination takes the hedonistic world of vampires and throws it right into the middle of a world-wide zombie apocalypse. Despite their immortality, the Vampires in Brooks' comics live only for the moment and watch in delight as the zombie plague virtually annihilates the human race. The vampires don't take any action to stop the flood of zombies until one Kierkegaard-quoting vampire proclaims the impending extinction of, not only humanity, but the vampires that feed on the poor humans. This is where the story gets good, but, unfortunately, this is also where the story ends. At least for now.

When zombie outbreaks start happening, the subdead (zombies) start eating the undead's (vampires) food supply. At first this is a hoot for the vampires because the zombies completely ignore them as a food source and they can roam freely. Eventually, the humans start becoming scarcer and this becomes a problem. Or I assume it will because the promo copy I got only included the first half of the graphic novel (which collects issues 1-5 of the series), but I ran out of interest before I ran out of pages. Who am I supposed to feel empathy for? The zombies are mindless hordes of eating machines. The vampires are hyperviolent and act like spoiled rich kids. The humans are mostly background characters to be eaten or drained or whatever. Maybe the second half would make me care a bit more or future issues will.I loved World War Z by Max Brooks because of the sympathetic and all too human characters in it. That is lacking here.

I would just enjoy it that much more if there was a better artist on the series.the concept is cool enough, although I fear that *anything* having to do with zombies is being stomped into the ground nowadays. Even the whole \"vampires and zombies in the same storyline\" concept is being used over an over... most recently the \"Empire Of The Dead\" comics by none other than George A. Romero. I like this concept though: the zombie outbreak is leading to the possible extinction of humanity, which inevitably will lead to the extinction of vampires as well. so vampires, normally treating humans as the expendable source of food and fun that they usually are, now have to make the choice to actually fight FOR humanity to save their own livelihoods as well.pretty cool, although the first Volume ends on a \"...and NOW it begins!\" note, which feels like the entire first trade paperback was a prequel to the actual story."}], "description": "Max Brooks, the best selling Zombie writer in history, unleashes an all-new horror epic! As humans wage their losing fight versus the hordes of the subdead, a frightening realization sets in with the secretive vampire race: our food is dying off.
