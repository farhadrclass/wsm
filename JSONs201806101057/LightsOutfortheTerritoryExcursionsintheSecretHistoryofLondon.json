I felt this text was inferior to London Orbital; I also collapsed to a minimal degree per some of Sinclair's personal bifurcations (to cite Roubaud) which I felt flat. His poetic waxing on pitbull culture was an ever-so-prescient for a rasher of recent events. Sinclair's stories overflow with woe yet they amaze and elicit."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1929624-tom", "userReview": "I liked parts of this book. Sinclair knows his way round a sentence and I enjoyed his self-conscious prose. However, this is more a collection of fairly fragmented essays on obscure artists, poets and film-makers, tied together with the vague conceit of the author as a tongue-in-cheek Fl\u00e2neur in London. Although I enjoyed the sections on Patrick Keiller and Chris Petit and the brief cameo from Howard Marks I didn\u2019t engage as much on some of the longer sections on conceptual and performance artists like Rachel Whiteread and Brian Catling. I wanted more of Sinclair\u2019s writing on London and urban space, rather than his critiques of the artists he obviously admires. At times I felt I might have been better served taking out a subscription with the London Review of Books and going through their back issues on line, given that many of the chapters were adapted from essays from the journal. Throughout reading Lights Out for the Territory, I was constantly making notes of other books to read and films to watch. I would have preferred to be more engaged with what I was reading, instead of feel distracted by the visions and imaginations of artists other than the author."}, {"userName": "Ben", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10412918-ben", "userReview": "At times brilliantly inventive and eye-opening, at times frustratingly oblique and obscure, I found this book a frustration and a delight in almost equal measure.Sinclair's 'psychogeographic' meanderings through the underground history, culture and communities of various parts of London is an acquired taste, and a piece of writing that requires significant application by the reader.Despite my interest in London geography(having studied the course at a London university) I found some of Sinclair's expositions impenetrable as they often require prior knowledge of the various poets, philosophers, writers and local personalities that he references. This said, the chapters that touched on topics as disparate as the history of St Pancras Old Church, the imagined community of the East End, the lives of the elites on the north bank of the Thames, and the alternative history of St Paul's Cathedral were profound, surprising and enthralling.The idea of the flaneur, the urban explorer who wanders the city landscape in search of deeper meaning and making imaginative connections between place and people through time and space, is certainly a powerful method for interpreting the city and succeeds in explaining London as an organic and ever-developing morass of people, ideas, histories and experiences. In this way, Sinclair opens up new avenues of inquiry and brings to the surface aspects of London that could easily have been forgotten.I would suggest that this book is better read as a series of short pieces of imaginative journalism, rather than one work with a running narrative. After all, the book is underpinned by a number of separate essays written by across a long period of time. Also, given the importance of the writer's photographer companion on his London wanderings, I was disappointed that so few of the photographs were included in the book."}, {"userName": "Tosh", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133661-tosh", "userReview": "What a great odd (eccentric?) book about one's city which is called London. But it's a London that many will not know. The loose term would be psycho-geography. Touring one's city with fresh eyes or just to drift among the architecture and its people. One picks up history like it was trash left over the night before.The Surrealists, specifically Andre Breton, started to walk through a cityscape without a map at times, but always keeping the eyes and ears open for new discoveries or new ways to frame 'history' in a new light. Guy Debord and company did the same with excellent results.Iain Sinclair does the same, and if one would find fault with this book, he does drop a lot of names that only hardcore British London people would know. The Krays, and certain writers/photographers known in the Soho London world. But I love it for that reason alone. It's a mind wondering all over a location that one 'thinks' they know. But alas there are still mysteries in neighborhoods and sections - it's endless really. This is my type of 'travel' writing!"}, {"userName": "Dan Scott", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/401360-dan-scott", "userReview": "If you want a completely different view of London and all her secrets read this book!

The excursion format allows for an enjoyably loose organization: this isn't a guidebook, and it joins together versions of several pieces that were written at different times for periodicals. Sinclair's London is in books and films as well as on the ground and in the imagination. For example, the section called \"X Marks the Spot\" refers to King's Cross, Boadicea, the meeting between Percy Shelley and his future wife at Mary Wollstonecraft's grave at Old St. Pancras, an epic poem by Aidan Dun, a graphic novel by Alan Moore, and more besides. I especially enjoyed the last section, in which Sinclair takes P. D. James to task for the shortcomings of her detective novel Original Sin, not least of which is her locating a Venetian palazzo in Wapping."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew", "userReview": "Like the television work of Jonathan Meades, Iain Sinclair is devoted to taking the built environment apart piece by piece, history and biography and graffiti all at once, and does so with a particular talent for turning a phrase (\"the Cypriot tailor who sent the Krays to the Old Bailey looking like Romanian secret servicemen at a wedding,\" par exemple). As a 'merican, I'm not getting half as much out of this as my British co-worker who periodically interrupts my work to chortle at a line from this as he follows Sinclair through his own old haunts in Brixton and Hackney, but I damn well enjoyed it, even if I needed to Wikipedia-check a few things from time to time."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3047454-leslie", "userReview": "Parts of this were brilliant, but after a while I started to feel like I was listening in on a conversation about people I don't know, that I was alone at a party where everybody else went back years and was full of news about old friends and acquaintances, about this person's new film project and that one's art installation and someone else's self-published poetic masterpiece, and the only way I could get in on the fun was to have read all the same books and participated in all the same happenings and attended all the same exhibits and known all the same people.

The book is supposedly about London, but really the places and people he visits or describes are launch pads for a disquisition on whatever interests him, from graffiti to houses to the river to all sorts of individuals, recognizable and obscure. At the level of detail and abstraction he gets to it demands close reading and can be difficult to follow. So, while often fascinating, it is abstruse at times. For example, the section on the artist Brian Catling who seems to operate in a world abstracted from everyday life, while living very much in the material world. Or, when comparing Catling to Henry Moore he says of Moore's sculptures \"These grave forms do not so much affect memory as displace it, decant their own weight, position themselves in our mappings of the city like railway temini.\" Whilst I kind of get the gist of it, this is either profound or gobbledegook and I'm unsure which. And so it is in many parts of the book. When he disapproves of or dislikes something he shows it: \"The toilet-club sit down ravers\" in reference to \"deregulated shamans, equal opportunity visionaries\" in London.Incredible, impressive, prodigious collections of details are thrown in casually all over the place. For example, referring to a London School of Film course on technique in a discourse on cinema, he notes that the critic David Thomson is one of the exceptions who actually noted attendance there as a credit on his resume. Where does he get it all from?Cinema Purgatorio is perhaps the most straightforwardly readable chapter and fluently humorous, as he describes his attempts, minor successes and failures to build a career in the world of cinema.Then there is substantial space given over to Lord Jeffrey Archer and his apartment overlooking the Thames. Sinclair obtains agreement to visiting Archer's apartment and which sends him off on a riff about the elitism of art and the lives of people who can afford it and who seek to enhance their status through their baubles, while living in a universe disconnected from the realities of most people. I was a young adult at the time Jeffrey Archer was at the top of his game in Thatcher's government and as a trashy novelist. I also experienced some degree of schaden freude at his fall from grace, when he was caught in a lie over the use of prostitutes. So, Lord Archer's Prospects is a chapter that was easier to follow and engage with. And maybe that's the weakness of the book - without prior knowledge or contextual insight on his various themes, it can be hard to track.He has a fixation on PD James and does not hold back on writing he is unimpressed by; and on films like Antonioni's Blowup, which allows him to venture off into digressions on various characters of differing artistic modes and to occasionally draw us back to some part of London that started him off. One of these is Maryon Park, from which he springs into stories about the photographers McCullin and Bailey, and the Beatles and Lynn Redgrave and Terence Stamp and various other characters like the Kray brothers who make appearances too. In his penultimate paragraph, he admits to being \"fond .... of these arbitrary leaps\". No kidding. A fitting, admission at end of a clever, quite brilliant book built on them."}, {"userName": "Michael K", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7633584-michael-k", "userReview": "The essential Sinclair book, with some of his later excursions across, around and within London coming off as an attempt to recapture this book's intense richness and breathless excitement as he brings to life the London that can be lived in. Although I am averse, in general, to eulogists of London who, altogether, grossly overstate its global cultural/historical ascendancy, what Sinclair has done here is provide a practical method to remake a city, any city. He achieves this with a combination of a journey that can be adapted/replicated by the reader and his own characteristic prose-styling, being himself an underrated and visionary poet (search out 'Lud Heat').Though books like 'London Orbital' may have reached a wider audience for Sinclair, their essential origin is here and what they miss is the additional function of this book as a definitive directory of occult currents, ancient and modern, that run through the city still, even after the brief period of 90's visibility that Sinclair's book provided."}, {"userName": "Nicholas Flower", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23349822-nicholas-flower", "userReview": "Dense, complex and enthralling, Sinclair riffs on London in wild cluttered prose that echoes the intense life and history of the city itself.
