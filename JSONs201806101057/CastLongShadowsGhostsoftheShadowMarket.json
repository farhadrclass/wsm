This time around not so much. Everyone who knows me, knows I'm absolute trash for anything Shadowhunter related, and usually if my fave Will is involved it's more than likely going to be 5 stars. For me this time around, it didn't really interest me or grip me as much as what I would of liked, I think the main reason is, there's a lot of new characters with a boat load of information; children belonging to who, other characters that were thrown in that for the life of me I couldn't remember.I adore seeing all of my favourite characters come together, I really do but it always breaks my heart because of the bloody epilogue in Clockwork Princess and it RUINS me! Then we get more heartache! Why can't my characters just be happy?! Some nice little bits that I enjoyed:- Henry's love for Charlotte is just ahhhh, I just love it so much, he's so wrapped up in his inventions but when it comes to Charlotte, it melts my little heart- Will and Tessa.

To give your heart a break after seeing people you love so well and that you miss so much. To put your mind at ease after being teased for something that won't be here for quite some time. To slow your breathing. And to just return to reality. Cause you know, sometimes living in Cassie's worlds is just simply better and nothing really ever compares.  Cast Long Shadows is as much of a returning as is an introduction and it makes the anticipation for The Last Hours both sweeter and so much more intensely excruciating! Seeing Jem arrested in this now familiar in between, Tessa and Will loving and living, Charlotte and Henry and all those new burning fires which are their children fills me with such joy and such longing and so much much much love for them all.

So thanks for Aunt Matilda and her blonde hair. And thanks for Henry for being such an amazing dad who loves his kids with all his heart.After reading \"Cast Long Shadows\" I got the feeling that with all his cheerful, charming way, Matthew really is just trying to hide some parts of his real self.

This whole book should be read after The Infernal Devices because there will be major spoilers for one of the characters in that series at least. Also, this book is about Matthew Fairchild, Charlotte Branwell\u2019s son (from The Infernal Devices). He has her last (maiden) name of Fairchild because she was the Consul. He\u2019s not directly mentioned in The Infernal Devices, but his older brother is mentioned at the end of Clockwork Princess. I think he\u2019ll be one of the main characters in the upcoming series, The Last Hours. So I guess these books could also be considered a prequel for that?This story starts in the same way as The Son of the Dawn, with Brother Zachariah at The Shadow Market, but in London 1901. He runs into Matthew Fairchild here, and then there\u2019s a flashback to Idris 1899. We learn that he\u2019s best friends with James Herondale, who has the ability to transform into a shadow. James is at odds with Alastair Carstairs, who ends up getting James expelled from the Shadowhunter Academy.And then Will Herondale makes an appearance! (And he now runs the London Institute.)We learn Matthew tried to befriend James, but James typically keeps to himself and is found reading. James does eventually agree to be his parabatai! And here begins a Herondale/Fairchild friendship.One of the main conflicts seems to be that Alastair has put it into Matthew\u2019s head that he is Gideon\u2019s child, not Henry\u2019s as Henry is an \u201cinvalid\u201d. Meanwhile, Jem is on a commission to find a book at the Shadow Market.Matthew runs into a faerie at the Market and has this exchange:\u201cAh, well. \u2018He has nothing, but he looks everything. What more can one desire?\u201d Matthew quoted. \u201cOscar Wilde. Do you know his work? I heard faeries like to steal poets. You should definitely have tried to steal him.\u201dThe woman laughed. \u201cPerchance we did. Do you wish to be stolen, honey sweet boy?\u201dI liked the random bits of humor that are present in all of Clare\u2019s work as well: \nPerhaps Matthew should spend his time brooding over a forbidden passion like James was currently doing.Matthew decided to give unrequited love a try. He stared out the window with all the pensive force he could muster. He was preparing to pass a hand across his fevered brow and murmur \u201cAlas, my lost love\u201d or some other such rot when he was abruptly rapped upon the head with a book.Honestly, Jamie was lethal with that thing.\u201cAre you quite well, Matthew?\u201d Jamie inquired. \u201cYour face suggests you are suffering from an ague.\u201d\nBack to the story: Later on, Matthew slips some truth serum into the scones everyone will eat for breakfast to see if there is any truth to Alastair\u2019s accusation and when there are consequences, Brother Zachariah is called in. Jem tells him he will keep his secret, but that he should share it with someone. Matthew replies coldly denying everything about the Shadow Market. I didn\u2019t understand this scene at all because we know he\u2019s ridden with guilt, and immediately after this scene he does try to go and confess to James, so why the sudden coldness with Jem?The story ends with a short scene from Jem\u2019s perspective where he is re-united with Tessa and we even get a brief scene with him and Will!Other characters: Christopher and Thomas Lightwood Christopher and Thomas are cousins (Christopher is Gabriel and Cecily\u2019s child, Thomas is Gideon and Sophie\u2019s). That makes James Herondale Christopher\u2019s cousin. And Thomas is one of the few people Alastair will listen to.Charles Buford - Matthew\u2019s older brother and Charlotte\u2019s son. Charlotte has no close family and Henry\u2019s family didn\u2019t approve of Charlotte being Consul.Alastair Carstairs - Jem\u2019s cousin. (It\u2019s his uncle Elias\u2019s son.) Has a sister named Cordelia who is much nicer and actually likes Jem/Brother Zachariah. Lucie Herondale plans to be Cordelia\u2019s parabatai.Anna - a cousin of Matthew\u2019s and who the next short story will be aboutRagnor Fell - a professor at the Shadowhunter Academy currently. ExtrasWhy does Thomas look up to Alastair? Because he's seen another side of him. (x) He is the fourth person Alastair likes, the first three being Cordelia, Charles Fairchild, and his mom. Alastair has issues at home (his dad didn't come to get him) and at the Academy (because he's half Persian). And there's a whole lot more about Alastair in the post I linked.[april 10] A sample of this novella can be found at the end of \"Son of the Dawn.\" This one will be released May 8.

In quel racconto c\u2019era anche Matthew e c\u2019erano i cugini Lightwood, Christopher e Thomas, e c\u2019era quello spocchioso arrogante e insopportabile di Alastair Carstairs. Alastair, oltre a essere causa dell\u2019espulsione di Jamie, aveva fatto delle rivelazioni al giovane Matthew, cose che lui aveva covato dentro fin da allora, e la visitina al Mercato delle Ombre con annessa conoscenza di una fata che vendeva pozioni, era stata il pretesto per sciogliere tutti i dubbi di Matthew su quella rivelazione. Il tutto davanti (o alle spalle) del nostro Jemmino.Questa novella presenta uno spaccato della vita degli Shadowhunters ai primi del 900. Quindi troviamo le famiglie Lightwood e Fairchild, gli Herondale e i Carstairs (seppure citati relativamente a Cordelia in qualit\u00e0 di parabatai di Lucie e Alistairs in quanto esemplare di idiota) e ci rendiamo conto di come vivessero in quell\u2019epoca e tra di loro, e di quanto importanti fossero i legami di amicizia, tanto da essere quasi al pari di quelli familiari.La figura centrale \u00e8 quella di Matthew . Se non fosse figlio di Charlotte e Henry, direi che potrebbe essere scambiato per un discendente degli Herondale, tanto somiglia a William e a Jace, per carattere e per aspetto.E anche gli errori di Matthew sono quelli di William, cosa che Jem riconosce benissimo.|Forse in serbo per Matthew Fairchild c\u2019era pi\u00f9 speranza e meno dolore di quanto temesse. Nessuno sapeva meglio di lui che si poteva non essere del tutto compresi eppure amati pienamente. Tutti i peccati potevano essere perdonati, e divenire i pi\u00f9 cari nelle tenebre. James non avrebbe permesso che il suo parabatai percorresse da solo sentieri oscuri. Non importava quali catastrofi sarebbero accadute, Jem riteneva che il figlio possedesse un cuore altrettanto grande quanto il padre. |Avrei letto delle vite di questi Shadowhunters per altre mille pagine."}], "description": "Matthew Fairchild is the Consul\u2019s son and the golden-haired boy of the Nephilim.
