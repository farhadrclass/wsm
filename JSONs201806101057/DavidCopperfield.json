All of the characters were utterly divine, even the detestable Uriah Heep and the unbelievably pathetic Dora, and most especially the wonderful early Feminist icon that is Betsy Trotwood. I often have my doubts on first-person narrative, but Dickens is one of the few who can do it so well without losing many of the great advantages of reading with an omnipotent narrator. David Copperfield is unreliable in many fields-mostly his blind-spot for falling in love-but he is in-tune with his surroundings and can express what he feels other characters around him are feeling so suitably that it matters not that we are seeing the world through his young eyes only.The world was fantastic: I am always immediately transported to these places when I read 19th Century fiction and this was no exception. The strife of the poor and the decadence of the indifferent rich is interwoven here like smoke billowing in to pure oxygen. There were so many nooks and crannies to be explored that it took me a while to get through this nigh-on 900 page book, but it was worth it.Aside from one or two tangents which meant the story-line stalled ever so slightly, it flowed magnificently and I don't remember laughing so much at a book that wasn't a straight humour novel. Dickens has a way of writing with such endearment about his characters and society, but also tearing them apart at the same time. It was a beautiful ride through the English countryside and a nice run through the heavy streets of London and I don't think Thackeray was wrong when he said, \"Bravo Dickens.\"Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "898. David Copperfield, Charles Dickens David Copperfield is the eighth novel by Charles Dickens. The novel's full title is The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (Which He Never Meant to Publish on Any Account). It was first published as a serial in 1849\u201350, and as a book in 1850. Many elements of the novel follow events in Dickens's own life, and it is often considered as his veiled autobiography. It was Dickens' favourite among his own novels. In the preface to the 1867 edition, Dickens wrote, \"like many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.\"\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0627\u067e\u0631\u0641\u06cc\u0644\u062f\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647:

last section of this elephantine novel, a sentence that strongly implies an autobiographical imprint of the author in the making of his famous middle-class hero. But is that aspect what I most value of this work? Far from it.This thick volume is quite an ambitious journey: partly a comic story, which often verges on a tale for children, and partly a picaresque book tinged with distinctive dramatic intention that fluctuates in the cyclical calamities and climaxes that sway a long list of memorable characters back and forth in the tide of Dickens\u2019 fluent storytelling. Marriage, friendship, betrayal, the multifarious forms of parenthood, and the eternal battle between good and evil are the axes around which the personal growth of naive, almost seraphic-like David will revolve. As I followed David from boyhood to adulthood and all the tragedies and unexpected gifts life throws on his way, I started to wonder about his real role in the story. Is David the \u201creal protagonist\u201d? Or is he a mere bystander, a passive witness that chronicles events unfolding around him without taking action in them? Maybe the real protagonists are the motley array of characters, so rich in description and recognizable for the repetitive idiomatic expressions that identify their eccentricities and foibles that make them unique\u2026.irreplaceable. Peggotty\u2019s mother\u2019s love, in spite of her being childless, Uriah Heep\u2019s humble meanness, Mr. Micawer\u2019s bountiful utterances, the always willin\u2019 Barkis, Mr. Dick\u2019s innocent intelligence, Mrs Gummidge\u2019s repetitive lament \u201cI\u2019m a lone lorn creetur and everything goes contrairy with me\u201d, Dora\u2019s childish capriciousness, Agnes\u2019 patient wisdom, Mr. Peggotty\u2019s huge heart\u2026This extended cast of characters paints the canvas of intricate humanity on David\u2019s quiet countenance, transfiguring him into a mirror that reflects the reader\u2019s own nature staring back in his eye, with all his vices and virtues glowing with renewed light. David doesn\u2019t move forward the pace of the narrative, he is the moving point on which everything else; plot, characters, essence; converges.But for this particular reader, David Copperfield goes beyond the realm of literary fiction; he has won a permanent place in my personal journey towards wholeness. He is a role model to look up to. His observant glance bespeaks of obstinate compassion and blind (blindness is not always bad!) faith in mankind, of the virtuous circle of goodwill and good intention, of the power of positive attitude in front of adversity.There is not an ounce of cheap sentimentalism in the numerous pages of this epic tale, but one will find an overdose of tenderness and smart humor that shine with intelligence and soul, that dares to approach life and its archetypical structures from other perspectives, that embraces those who are different as dear life. The concept of family has drastically expanded and reached a superior level for me. Family is now an unknown \u201cvalley, with the evening sun shining on the remote heights of snow, that close it in, like eternal clouds\u201d, an open door that welcomes the future, wherever it might lead me."}, {"userName": "Violet wells", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells", "userReview": "Call it an act of heresy but I\u2019m abandoning this. I\u2019ve got to page 600 which means I\u2019ve only another 150 pages to go but I\u2019ve completely lost interest. The characters are too one dimensional and you can see the plot coming as if it\u2019s daubed in road marking paint. I\u2019ve read all of Dickens\u2019 novels except the early ones and mostly loved them except for Tale of two Cities and the reason I\u2019d never read this was I believed, mistakenly, it was another early one. However it reads like an early one, so I wasn\u2019t completely mistaken. By which, I mean it\u2019s lathered with sentimentality. It was Dickens\u2019 favourite of his novels which I find odd and doesn\u2019t say much for his critical faculties but explains to me why he never quite excised the sentimental strain in his writing: he simply couldn\u2019t see it. Because the sentimentality is like a sickly sweet smell on virtually every page of this novel. Perhaps because of its autobiographical nature he enjoyed writing this a bit too much. When an author gets carried away with the delights of his own story perhaps the inner editor goes into abeyance. It doesn\u2019t begin well. David as a character reminded me of the AI in Stephen Spielberg\u2019s film of the same name, except, unlike the AI, his programming as irreproachable child never falters. We\u2019re presented with a moral universe of absolutes. There\u2019s no nuance. Mr and Miss Murdstone are pantomime baddies, as lacking in subtlety as their name suggests; Peggoty, his nurse, is a paragon of virtue. David, as child, isn\u2019t any kind of child I recognise. He\u2019s never mischievous or unruly. Cruelty has no meaningful effect on his character. He\u2019s never capable of irrational response \u2013 good people after all can still be highly irritating and bad people fascinating and especially authoritative. But only good people have authority for David which basically means he will never develop much as a character, which he doesn\u2019t. David is a neutered foolproof moral touchstone. The novel throughout has a pantomime binary moral system. A character, with one or two exceptions, is either wholly good or wholly bad. So, the first 100 pages were a bit of a struggle for me. I found Peggoty and the evil Murdstones tiresomely predictable. It was therefore a massive relief when the morally ambiguous Steerforth arrives on the scene. Finally we sense David might evolve from a potted plastic flower into one rooted in soil and subject to weather. Finally we see his moral judgements are subject to error. Finally we see the possibility of him being influenced by something other than unadulterated virtue. Unfortunately though Dickens soon repeats the early template of moral absolutes with a new set of characters. And Steerforth, the only character capable of messing with David\u2019s programmed predictability, vanishes from the novel. There\u2019s no character development in this novel. Even as an adult David still seems like a ten year old. No surprise then that he falls in love with a female counterpart \u2013 an adult ten year old female. Before reading this I would have nominated Dorothea and Casaubon in Middlemarch if someone had asked me which couple in the history of literature I found it most difficult to imagine having sex together. However David and Dora now get that award. In fact, sex, like everything else that happens to him, has no notable effect on his character. The moral light in this novel is glaring; it hurts the eyes. No surprise then that the unpredictable dark charge of sex is hostile to its regulated lighting system and so ignored. Of course it\u2019s not all bad. The sentence writing is consistently brilliant. And as ever Dickens creates his characters with the startled wide-eyed wonder of a child \u2013 always they have an almost hallucinated detailed vividness, that larger than life quality, a single oddball defining trait, with which we tend to see grownups as children. We magnify one detail which comes to represent the person in question. It was probably his most inspired feature, his ability to see the world through the eyes of a child but narrate his findings with the eloquence of an adult. Dickens has never been a great psychologist; he doesn\u2019t have much to say about the inner life; his terrain is generally surfaces. The surface of this novel reminded me of a gaudy birthday card with embossed pink hearts and ribbons splashed all over it. For me Dickens is the master purveyor of the novel as light entertainment. But this was more soap opera than novel."}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "Status Report: Chapters 1 - 8i had forgotten how much i love Dickens. the man is a master at the immersive experience. it is really easy for me to get sucked into the world he is so carefully constructing, to revel in all the extensive details, the lavish description, the almost overripe imagination at work. his strength at creating a wide range of entirely lived-in settings (both brief snapshots of places in passing and crucial places like David's home and school) is equalled by his even more famous skill at sketching the characters - often, but not always, caricatures - that live and breathe in his world. this is the kind of deep-dish experience that i love to have when traveling, on a plane or a bus or in some plaza, a second world to live in while taking a break in exploring the immediate world around me.i can't help but also remember how many people dislike Dickens. i'm remembering an ex who told me he was her least favorite author, and how her resentment at being forced to read him in high school almost put her off reading for pleasure in general. it is hard to reconcile such a strong distaste for Dickens with my own easy enjoyment of his novels. my automatic reaction is that the reader who isn't enchanted by him either dislikes the style of writing or is simply the sort of idiot who should stick to reading facebook. well i don't date idiots, so i assume her reaction is based around the writing style. maybe that is the basic rationale for most folks who don't care for him.or maybe it is based on something else. there is something that i've found to be off-putting about David Copperfield, at least so far. namely, the incredibly passive and naive behavior of David himself (and his mother, of course). it's more than just my automatic distaste for reading about victims, although that is certainly a part of it. what it feels like at times is that Dickens is stacking the deck a bit, making miserable situations even more potentially miserable, by having his protagonist (and that wretched mother, of course) be almost developmentally disabled in his inability to understand even basic things about the world around him. it sorta drives me up the wall.well, that complaint aside, this has still been an awesome time. first and foremost, even more than the world-building and juicy characters, i love the dry and sardonic humor that is constantly working double-time. not only does it create some distance between reader and book in regards to the various horrors visited upon young David... it is fookin' hilarious!favorite parts so far:- that brilliant opening chapter \"I Am Born\"- the Peggotty boat-house and the warmth of that wonderful family. i would like to live there!- Steerforth. ugh! what a charming monster.- the sadly minor note tragedy of Mr. Mell\u2602Status Report: Chapters 9 - 26i think i was expecting a bit more evil from the Murdstones. the way they treat David is certainly unkind verging on cruel - but i suppose i thought it would be a lot more brutal. this is not a complaint! if anything, i appreciate that Dickens makes David's predicament a much more realistic one. the Murdstones are cold, cold people. and they certainly drive David's tedious mother to an early grave (i shed no tears on that one). but i was surprised that their primary action is to simply send David away to a boring job, one that no child his age should have (and here i am viewing the narrative through my 21st century lense). a callous decision yet not a vicious one. David is merely an irritation that they want to dispense with, rather than harm. interesting.that brief segment was certainly enlivened by the depiction of the marvelously goofy Mr. Micawber & Family. and by a fascinating look into life in a debtor's prison. i assume this is the classic Poor House?but then... good grief, poor David Copperfield goes through hell to escape this life of tedium. many emotions on my part, all centered on the idea of such casual cruelty towards a runaway. brought back some unsettling memories of my brief time as a homeless youth counselor.and then - at last! - some decency. even better, eccentric rather than mawkish decency. Aunt Betsey & Mr. Dick are two more wonderful Dickens creations. especially that tough old broad Aunt Betsey - each and every one of her appearances are a delight. when David finally gets to the safety of his Aunt's house, i felt a lot of tension drain out of me. it is like his story is now truly about to begin, now that the Gothic horrors slash neglected childhood bits are out of the way.- an introduction of the best character yet: Uriah Heep! this is the role that Crispin Glover was born to play. what a wondrously creepy and perfectly realized little villain. all that supplicating, all that writhing! brilliant stuff.- interesting: David is rarely called by his actual name. two more nicknames are added to the list: Trotwood and Daisy. David is rather a tabula rasa of a character.- the relationship between Mr. Wickfield and Agnes is not heartwarming. it is downright creepy.and now the tension is ratcheted up again, but in a way that doesn't make me sorta squirm with discomfort (tales of child neglect \u2260 a good time for me). three sets of increasingly dire circumstances... (1) Lil' Em'ly and the despicable villain Steerforth(2) Agnes and the despicable villain Uriah Heep(3) Aunt Betsey and a mysterious, blackmailing unknown despicable villainwill David be able to intercede in any of these troubling situations? i am doubtful, but also hopeful. go, David, go!\u2601Status Report: Chapters 27 - endexhilarating, wonderful, awesome, etc, etc. all the good words. i laughed (a lot), i cried (just a little, and in a manly sort of way), i wouldn't change or subtract a single word. perfect!\u263cFinal Reportokay this will be less of a Final Report and more of a collection of final thoughts as i think back on the novel and consult with the various threads in Serials Serially - the group that started me reading this novel.first, the division in the novel. the first third or so, all about young David and his fairly awful travails: vivid and powerful. the remainder of the novel, all about David in his young adult years and following the growth of all those narrative seeds planted in that fertile first third; an excess of details veering on repetitious, and so that the book becomes less of a frightful gothic tale and more of a slow-burning assortment of mysteries (and many, many instances of pure comedy): less vivid and perhaps less powerful. looking back, i have to say that i am in the minority and preferred the last two-thirds. not only was the tension of potential situations involving child abuse and neglect now gone (a personal bugaboo of mine that will quickly render almost any literary or cinematic experience into something hugely uncomfortable and unappealing)... but it somehow all felt more real to me. the first third was visceral but almost cartoonish while the rest of the novel felt as if i was actually living in the novel. such was the extent of the detail and the effect of following these characters as they move throughout many different situations and changes in their lives.\"cartoonish\". or better yet, \"Dickensian\". what does that really mean? a peculiarly stylized version of caricature? i understand the rep that Dickens has with his characters. they are stylized, obviously. but very few of them remained caricatures to me. ultimately, most ended up feeling very real and i was impressed at Dickens' ability to provide multiple dimensions to his characters - although he does it in a rather subtle way. his heroes do not get strong criticism and his villains do not get endearing moments of humanity. and yet it is there. David Copperfield is kind and good, but he is also a passive, foolishly naive fellow whose kindness and naivete often does nothing but make situations worse - especially in nearly every instance involving his relationship with Steerforth. Agnes is also kind and good, but her passivity makes her function as a sort of enabler to her father. Steerforth is a callous and feckless villain, but has moments of genuine warmth and kindness. Rosa Dartle is a heartless shrew - but look at that poor bitch's entire life with Steerforth & mom - i'd become a heartless shrew in that situation as well. Uriah Heep is an unctuous, slimy kiss-ass and back-stabber... but look where he comes from, his context, the kind of person his father was and the ideals he was raised up to worship. and of course Micawber, who would be pure pathos but whom Dickens treats with an extraordinary amount of affection. Dickens is not necessarily an 'even-handed' author, but he is one who is clearly aware of context.there are some comments in this review's thread about women in Dickens - comments that i initially agreed with. but in retrospect, i actually don't agree. looking back on this novel, the women are often just as full of life as the men. perhaps folks are mainly thinking of the rather anemic Agnes. but now - when i think of dim Dora and vicious Rosa and ferocious Aunt Betsey and tragic Emily and loveable Peggotty and maudlin Mrs Gummidge and pathetic Martha and the eccentric 'two little birds' (Dora's aunts) and pretentious Julia Miles and dignified-under-pressure Mrs Strong and hilariously faithful-to-a-fault Mrs Micawber - i think of characters who leap right off of the page and stay to live in my mind. so, no, i am not critical of how women are portrayed in Dickens.except, maybe, Dora. she is surely one of the most bizarrely stupid characters ever created in classic literature. when she first baby-talks David's nickname \"Doady\", i practically wanted to barf. she's so stupid that many times i found myself thinking She's Not Stupid - She's Mentally Disabled! good grief! and so i felt bad about my contempt and i started having mixed feelings about David even being with her. it seemed somehow wrong. there is also something so sexless about her character - it was impossible for me to imagine her capable of any sort of genuine intimacy. but i have to give it to Dickens - he doesn't present her as an ideal (unlike David), he satirizes her mercilessly in scene after scene, and in the end, invests both her marriage and her death with such genuine, palpable emotion that i became genuinely, palpably moved. her marriage scene (practically every paragraph beginning with \"Of\") was one of the most dreamily written passages i've ever read. and her death - not explicitly described, but paralleled with Jip's death - wow. amazing scene.the combined death scenes of brave Ham and horrible Steerforth was almost equally moving. that last line describing Steerforth at his final rest: superb.okay i think i'm spent. this is one of those novels that i can probably talk on and on about, so i should just make myself stop. i'll close by saying that the novel is, in a word, brilliant. i loved the language, the humor, the whimsy, the drama; the characters were wondrously alive; the narrative both surprisingly subtle and excitingly larger-than-life. so many scenes were indelible - too many to recount.

I despise Mr. Murdstone, I adore David, I want to slap his mother, I would spit on Dora, I laugh with Peggotty, I cheer Emily on, I pity Uriah Heep, and I sympathize with his aunt Betsy Trotwood.

I have to say that, copying Thackaray for the millionth time, probably. What a difference to read the original, compared to the watered-down versions I was familiar with from my childhood. It took me quite a lot of time to get into the rich flow of words, the beautiful allusions, and the dry humour, but then I was hooked. My family will always remember the Christmas vacation when I was in a rage against Uriah Heep, not able to contain my anger, sharing my frustration loudly! But it wasn't only annoyance with the blatant hypocrisy, vulgarity and opportunism, of course. I fell in love with the minor characters, as I usually do when reading Dickens. And just following their paths, walking through 19th century London, is a delight!Update: My eldest son finished it as well now, and interestingly he was more annoyed with David's naivety than with Uriah's hypocrisy and criminal activities. By now fully acquainted with the Copperfield universe, he read a comment in The Economist, and burst out laughing at the notoriously self-promoting, self-indulgent, deceptive politician of our days, who claimed to be \"very humble indeed - people wouldn't believe really how humble I am!\"\"Is 'e as 'umble as Uriah?\" my son asked, laughing tears.

Instead I will put in few lines what I like about this:I loved that little scared child, who loved his mother from the bottom of his heart who despite all her efforts couldn\u2019t save him from the Murdstones. My heart went out for this afraid, stammering kid. And perhaps this hard behavior honed him into something strong that held him up in the tough times, inspired him to go on and never stop. If Murdstones\u2019 cruelty made him strong then his aunt Betse Trotwood and his nurse, Peggotty, showed him how to love, trust, and hope. It was just so beautiful to see them carve him into a good man.As he became a man, friends i.e. Micawber and Traddles, taught him to smile and made him an honest man.But Agnes put soul into this hard, strong, and loving man. She inspired him to keep doing good deeds. She calmed him in spite of going through hell herself. Just like David, I was in awe of this girl/woman throughout the book. This book left me bittersweet. Bitter because I was not ready to say good bye to these characters yet and sweet because it ended on a high note. I heaved a huge sigh of relief after seeing my favorite people getting what they deserved.Such a simple yet an absolutely beautiful book."}, {"userName": "Barry Pierce", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4593541-barry-pierce", "userReview": "David Copperfield is an early queer novel by Charles Dickens. It follows David Copperfield, a gay man in early 19th century England, as he tries to seduce and betroth another gay man, James Steerforth. Copperfield first sets his eyes on Steerforth at Salem House where they both must subdue their love for each other, giving their age difference and the society of the time. However, as the novel progresses, Copperfield and Steerforth live openly as a homosexual couple. Their relationship comes into peril when Dora Spenlow, a jealous fag hag, refuses to continue living as Copperfield's beard and forces him to marry her. Thus, Copperfield and Steerforth break apart. All seems lost until Copperfield befriends Tommy Traddles, another boy whose acquaintance he had made at Salem House. They partake in a salubrious love affair to which Dickens pens several hundred pages of steamy man-on-man action. However, once again this relationship is cast into peril by that bitter old queen Uriah Heep.Uriah Heep is a mean gay and the epitome of masc4masc culture. Heep sees Copperfield as fit young otter and attempts to kill off Traddles by throwing pearls beneath his feet \u00e0 la Showgirls. However his plan is spoiled after his findom daddy, Mr. Micawber (the man who famously threw the first brick at Stonewall), repossess his pearls because Heep refuses to send him any more daguerreotypes of his feet.Or, in other words:David Copperfield is more of the same from Dickens. More straight-forward than some of his previous novels, Dickens instead relies on verisimilitude rather than ridiculousness in order to tell this story. It is a pity as the more outrageous Dickens is, the more I enjoy him. However, despite this novel only receiving three-stars from me, it is still better than most novels ever written. It is only 'three-stars' within Dickens' own bibliography and not the greater Western canon. It probably would have been four-stars if he had included more chapters with Miss Mowcher."}, {"userName": "Lu\u00eds C.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34132356-lu-s-c", "userReview": "As always after reading such a density, it is a bit of a friend left on the road. Dickens himself will admit to having had difficulty in quitting David Copperfield after such a long intimacy!This novel is, he says in the preface, his favorite, and when he has to read an extract in front of an audience, a few years later, the choice of this extract is anguishing because this novel is a whole, a set of entangled narratives one in the other that can not be separated without breaking the fabric of the work.It is also that this novel is very personal and that Dickens has put a lot of it in this character! On this point, the notes are captivating.But when I say that I just left a friend here or should I specify \"a bunch of friends,\" which is especially Copperfield custodian of ups and downs.David Copperfield, aged about 40, turns to his past, a long, quiet river at a time when he will meet the Peggoty, brother and sister Murdstone, Emily, Steerforth, his aunt, Agnes , the Micawber and finally Dora of which he will become mad lover.To enumerate the characters who will follow David in his journey - good, bad, sometimes both - I retrace in my head the thread of the story and I say to myself: what way made!Dickens is a fine storyteller who is not afraid to throw away from time to time some information about the future of the narrator keeping us in suspense for the nevertheless seven hundred pages that follow, not hesitating to add a good dose of humor to some dramatic scenes, and a tender love when death is involved.It was the little David, the orphan, who most moved me, but I give my affection to Mr. Peggoty, to Agnes, and of course to David's aunt who will change completely when she opens the door to a poor vagrant child.It is also a sometimes pathetic portrait of industrial England and finally an almost cinematographic work that inspired the greatest of the years that followed its publication.Goodbye David!"}, {"userName": "Geoff", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126266-geoff", "userReview": "Read the majority of this over the course of 4 days snowed in under 2 or so feet of blizzard and its dimming snowlight day's circular repetition, in a new house, often in near silence only punctuated by winter robins chirping outside, in between making pots of coffee and organizing my books and music and furniture.

This is his most personal one, according to himself.Why 4 out of 5 stars? Because it was kind of difficult to digest it a bit, I had to go through some pages more than once and try to get the origin of some characters, but most of them are in my head now. Easy to fall in love with them, and the story itself is kind of unforgettable mixing an orphan boy, lovely adventures, interesting trials, among others. If I were a villain someday (hope not), I would like to be like Uriah Heep.A very nostalgic book, a total must of Classic Literature, I will totally re-read it as soon as I can.I am very proud of my name being \"Charles\" in Spanish version, even if it was just by coincidence.Recommended?

I read the first page.I then proceeded to the counter, and bought it.This is the beginning of my love story with \"David Copperfield\", an absolute favorite. It takes a particular mindset to read it I think, so it took me a while to finish it, matching my reading moments with that mindset as much as possible. You need a romantic side and you need to be able to get in touch with it in order to enjoy this book, but if you give this tale a chance, it will nurture that sensitive side and make you get tears of joy.This book is a biography of a wonderful, semi-fictional person, David Copperfield, whose ordeals and adventures are based on those experienced by Charles Dickens. David's thoughts are generous and because this book is written from his perspective, everything he describes around him is depicted in their best possible light. The world is such a nice place through his eyes, even in the most dreary situations of poverty, abandonment and death of loved ones. Plenty of songs of happiness and love are sung in this book, but like in every life, there is not just that. Sadness, death, loss, heartache become beautiful because of their purity and their core of warmth, a warmth so well expressed in this book. Betrayal and jealousy become even uglier when put next to the purer feelings. It hasn't always been an easy read. Some passages are rather slow and a rare couple of segments that were meant to be funny have somehow lost their edge (most humourous instances still retain their power over your mouth corners and unshaken belly, though. They will yield, I assure you!). The local dialects in which some of the protagonists speak sometimes make it very difficult to understand for a non-native English speaker like myself. I have read this book with a little notebook next to me to take down the most memorable quotes. It was difficult not to just simply copy entire pages at times. Here are some of my favorite quotes -who are really stories in themselves- which show the timeless humour and the great pen of an author who has shown that the most naive thing to be is to be anything but continuously amazed with the wonders all around you:\u201cBe thankful for me, if you have a kind heart, as I think you have, that while I know well what I am, I can be cheerful and endure it all. I am thankful for myself, at any rate, that I can find my tiny way through the world, without being beholden to anyone; and that in return for all that is thrown at me, in folly or vanity, as I go along, I can throw bubbles back.\u201d\"Very much admired, indeed, the young woman was. What with her dress; what with the air and sun; what with being made so much of; what with this, that, and the other; her merits really attracted general notice.\"\"This country I am come to conquer! Have you honours? Have you riches? Have you posts of profitable pecuniary emolument? Let them be brought forward. They are mine!\"\"Oh the river! I know it's like me! I know that I belong to it. I know that it's the natural company of such as I am! It comes from country places, where there was no harm in it - and it creeps through the dismal streets, defiled and miserable - and it goes away, like my life, to a great sea that is always troubled and I feel that I must go with it.\"\"If, any sunny forenoon, she had spread a little pair of wings and flown away before my eyes, I don't expect I should have regarded it as much more than I had had reason to expect.\"\"And if ever, in my life, I have had a void made in my heart, I had one made that day.\"\"I shall never forget the waking next morning; the being cheerful and fresh for the first moment, and then the being weighed down by the stale and dismal oppression of remembrance.\"\"It would be no pleasure to a London tradesman to sell anything which was what he pretended it was.\"\"...and that she desired her compliments, which was a polite fiction on my part.\"\"When I woke next morning, I was resolute to declare my passion to Dora, and know my fate. Happiness or misery was now the question. There was no other question that I knew of in the world, and only Dora could give the answer to it.\"\"Love must suffer in this stern world; it ever had been so, it ever would be so. No matter. Hearts confined by cobwebs would burst at last, and then Love was avenged.\"If you love Love, with the big L, you'll love this Book."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "David Copperfield is a convolutedly grotesque and darkly satirical Bildungsroman.First of all, David Copperfield is a colourful collection of inimitable characters. And we pass through this flowery assembly as through the gallery of images taken from Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s canvases\u2026The gloomy taint that was in the Murdstone blood, darkened the Murdstone religion, which was austere and wrathful. I have thought, since, that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of Mr. Murdstone\u2019s firmness, which wouldn\u2019t allow him to let anybody off from the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse for. Be this as it may, I well remember the tremendous visages with which we used to go to church, and the changed air of the place. Again the dreaded Sunday comes round, and I file into the old pew first, like a guarded captive brought to a condemned service.Edward Murdstone is like a slab of blind bigotry and he is an epitome of cruelty and human meanness. As I came back, I saw Uriah Heep shutting up the office; and, feeling friendly towards everybody, went in and spoke to him, and at parting, gave him my hand. But oh, what a clammy hand his was! as ghostly to the touch as to the sight! I rubbed mine afterwards, to warm it, and to rub his off.It was such an uncomfortable hand, that, when I went to my room, it was still cold and wet upon my memory. Leaning out of window, and seeing one of the faces on the beam-ends looking at me sideways, I fancied it was Uriah Heep got up there somehow, and shut him out in a hurry.Uriah Heep is the slimiest creature I\u2019ve ever met in literature or anywhere else.And David Copperfield passes through this assembly of characters like a martyr through a series of the unavoidable and harrowing ordeals.As a piece of ore should pass through the furnace to become a metal, so a boy should pass through the process of coming of age to become a man."}, {"userName": "Piyangie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48056505-piyangie", "userReview": "In your reading life you encounter all sorts of books; books you like; books you love; and books perhaps you wish not to have come your way. At rare occasions you come across a book, which you feel privileged to have read. David Copperfield undoubtedly falls in to this rare category. The book needs no praise by me. It is only yet another addition to the millions of readers who have loved and appreciated this great work from the time of its first publication. Charles Dickens himself had said that David Copperfield was his \"favourite (literary) child\". All these are proof of the book's worth and greatness. Charles Dickens has written so many great books. There is no argument of it. But if he ever wrote a book with his whole heart and soul, it is David Copperfield. Even though I haven't read all his books, I can vouch that this is so. I admit that I'm swooned but my conviction is coherent; for how it could be otherwise, when it is almost autobiographic of the author? Dickens is well known for his clever and witty writing, his satirical observations on English society. But if Dickens is ever known for beautiful, passionate and sincere writing, the credit falls upon David Copperfield. David\u2019s life resembles Dickens\u2019s in many respects. Like David, Dicken had a troubled childhood; and like David, Dickens had to leave school for employment at a tender age to support him (and in Dickens\u2019s case his family too as his father was imprisoned for his pecuniary liabilities). The experience which David obtains at a very young age helps him learn about life and the need to work hard with consistency and devotion in order to become successful in life. This was Charles Dicken\u2019s motto too. He was a self-made man, whose craving for knowledge and learning made him successful in spite of the difficulties that surrounded his childhood. Like David, Dickens was a Parliamentary reporter before completely turning in to authorship. In short, David is his literary presentation of himself, more or less. The main story in David Copperfield is the life journey of David Copperfield from birth to old age, filled with loss, hardship, struggle, adventure, success and happiness; and is narrated by him. The story is also about the moral and personal development of David from his childhood to youth to adulthood; how he grows up from his childhood fantasies and mistaken impressions, his vanity and self-importance of youth and the mistakes of his undisciplined heart to learning the true meaning and value of life.In addition, the stories of the major characters, which are closely connected with his, are included. These stories allow the reader to gain a broad perception on the then English society, the differences of people according to their classes, the vain superiority of the rich, the difficulties and struggles of average men and women, and tragic lives of young innocent girls who become victims of wicked and lustful men. A wider area of life, of relationship between parent and child, husband and wife, of morals and principles, of tragic lives of \"fallen women\" (due to no fault of theirs), of society, is addressed in these stories making it a complete work. David Copperfield is truly a great book. In my reading life, I have come across many that emotionally affected me; but only a handful had been able to tug at my heartstrings. David Copperfield is certainly one, and perhaps on top of all of them. There were many instances that I was in tears, my lips trembling and my heart weeping; and that I couldn\u2019t go on. The stories, the characters, all were so true and so real. If anyone thinks of reading only one book of Dickens, it should, without doubt, be David Copperfield.To the opening statement of the book that \u201cwhether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must know\u201d, I have this to say as a reader. David is the hero of his life because of the unconditional love and support of two heroines: his aunt Betsy and Agnes."}, {"userName": "MJ Nicholls", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2386804-mj-nicholls", "userReview": "Finished. Having a hard time spinning superlatives for this review. It is more or less established I strongly like, or passionately love, every Dickens novel I read so why not slap a five-star badge on this masterpiece and hop down to Bev\u2019s caf\u00e9 for a veggie burger, free sexual innuendo with every purchase, a fly in every milkshake, and a 50p discount on all half-cooked omelettes? Fine. Some highlights. Improvements in characterisation. Notably, the villains. David\u2019s friendship with Steerforth partially blinds the reader to his scoundrelly tendencies until his flitting with sweet Emily. Uriah Heep\u2019s squirminess and umbleness wrongfoots the reader until his scoundrelly tendencies are unmasked (although David outs him as a beast from the start). The first-person narrator opens doors of eloquence in Dickens\u2019s prose hitherto closed in the topographical omniscience of previous works. As usual, a memorable cast of eccentrics, stoics, loveable fuck-ups and social climbers. No sagging secondary plots like in Dombey and Son. Deeply moving passages on the passing of time, memory, penitence, friendship and na\u00efve love (Dora is a female Peter Pan). High-class comedy a-go-go. An enriching experience.

I've been burnt by Dickens before (Tale of two Cities). I swore up and down I would never suffer through a another Dickens book ever again. When I spotted this beautiful mint condition vintage copy of David Copperfield, I just couldn't resist. It was free and it seemed like such a shame to just leave it there. It was snowy and damp and I knew if someone didn't rescue it it would become sinfully ruined. I knew if I took it home I was going to force myself to read it sooner or later, one way or another. So picking it up and actually taking it home was an inevitable commitment. The book is 881 pages long.. Once I start reading I go all the way. I have a no abandonment rule, but this one almost pushed me to change that rule. It started off great, at first I couldn't believe that this was the same writer who wrote A Tale of Two Cities. To me reading a Tale of Two Cities was like trying to read Sanskrit. I was initially glad to have given Dickens a second try because I would have otherwise missed his literary diversity...that's what I first thought...Then like 250 pages in I realized I was suckered into it AGAIN!! Gorgeously written but incredibly and painfully dull. David Copperfield annoyed me so much. There was nothing romantic or noteworthy about his entire story. It was like being forced to watch someone else's boring home-videos. It lacked maturity. It seemed like he never grew up to be a man, and remained a rosy-cheeked, self-back-patting little ass-kisser. Then you gotta love how Dickens conveniently kills off his wife Dora so he can have the opportunity to marry his REAL true love, Agnes, whom he never even knew he loved. How romantic. Just what every woman dreams of being.. sloppy seconds. It's not even worth getting into the rest of the reasons why I didn't enjoy the story, so I'll wrap it up by saying:If I'm ever rummaging through another junk pile of books, and I run across another Dickens, I don't care if the light of God is shining it's golden rays on it, and inside is a map that leads me to a treasure of flawless fist-full chunks of diamonds, I will never ever take another Dickens home ever again.To all the people who gave this 5 stars..you lie."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143689-john", "userReview": "I finished reading David Copperfield on the Kindle a few days ago.I\u2019m not an English major, and so I\u2019m not going to pretend to be one. I\u2019m not going to discuss what themes the book touches on, what category it fits in, or generally dissect it to the point where it\u2019s more monotonous than fun.I read the book because I wanted to, not because I had to write a paper about it.I must say, first of all, that this has got to be one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. The vivid descriptions of the characters were just fun to read. One particularly meek man was described like this: \u201cHe was so extremely conciliatory in his manner that he seemed to apologize to the very newspaper for taking the liberty of reading it.\u201dSome of the scenes in the novel are amazingly vivid and memorable. The hilarious and tense scene towards the end where one of the main villains is taken down was one, and of course just about every scene involving David\u2019s aunt is too.Dickens is a master of suspense. He does it through subtle premonitions in the book. You might not even really notice them as you\u2019re reading. But it sure had an effect on me: I had trouble putting the book down, and stayed up later than I should have on more than one night to keep reading another chapter or three.Like any good book, this one left me to think even after I was done reading it, and left me wanting to read it again. Right now.There are some practical downsides to it, though. It was written in the 1850s, and some of the vocabulary and British legal, business, and monetary discussions are strange to a modern casual American audience. Nevertheless, with the exception of the particularly verbose Mr. Micawber, you can probably make it through without a dictionary, though one will be handy. I read it on the Kindle, which integrates a dictionary and makes it very easy to look up words. I learned that a nosegay is a bouquet of showy flowers. And that Mr. Micawber was fond of using words obsolete since the 17th century, according to the Kindle. If you remember that \u201cpecuniary emoluments\u201d refers to a salary, you\u2019ll be doing OK.The other thing that occasionally bugged me was that the narrator (David) would comment on some sort of gesture, or comment that wasn\u2019t very direct, and then say something like, \u201cBut she didn\u2019t need to be more explicit, because I understood the meaning perfectly.\u201d Well, sometimes I didn\u2019t. Though I usually figured it out after a bit. I was never quite sure if Dickens was being intentionally needling to the reader, or if an 1850s British reader would have figured out the meaning perfectly well. But that was part of the fun of it, I think.This review also posted on my blog at http://changelog.complete.org/archive..."}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "David Copperfield is one of my favourite Dickens' books, and I tend to enjoy Dickens quite a lot.

It was as true,\u201d Mr. Barkis said, nodding his nightcap, which was his only means of emphasis, \u201cas taxes is. And nothing\u2019s truer than them.\u201d\nI enjoyed the hell out of this book. From the first page to the last, I was having a damned good time. I even made quite a bother of myself several times among friends and family, imitating my favorite characters, only to get blank stares and polite smiles, as I realized that not one among them had read this wonderful book.Part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was that I listened to an audiobook version. If you haven\u2019t tried Dickens that way, I recommend it; what is dull, dry, and dreary on the page becomes lyrical and lively when listened to. Dickens had a great ear for dialogue, and you deserve to hear it.So what of the book? I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t have anything terribly original to say. What struck me, and what strikes almost everyone, was Dickens\u2019s amazing ability to caricature\u2014to conjure up, in only a few lines of descriptions, cartoonish and hyperbolic figures that stick effortlessly in the imagination. Some people complain that his characters are too over-the-top; but, to me, that\u2019s like complaining that James Brown shouted too much\u2014that\u2019s the point. And just as James Brown could turn a yelp into high art, so could Dickens turn the lowly art of caricature into world-class literature. It is almost as if, by blowing certain personality traits out of all proportion, Dickens could transcend the silence of the written page, inflating his creations into flesh and blood, like a clown blowing up a balloon. Instead of feeling like you\u2019re reading a book, you feel as if you\u2019re listening to a conversation in the other room.And what lovely conversation to overhear! Dickens has a tremendous, almost supernatural, ability to create characters. Every character\u2014even if they are extremely minor\u2014has a great deal of care lavished upon them; they have their own ways of speaking, thinking, gesturing, walking, laughing. Whether Dickens is writing of the rich or poor, he doesn\u2019t disappoint; and several I found absolutely endearing. (Mr. Barkis and Betsy Trotwood were my favorites.) The only place Dickens does falter is in his characterizations of young women. Dora was a doll, and Agnes an angel; they were, both of them, uninteresting. Still, I thought that Dickens\u2019s portrayal of Copperfield\u2019s marriage to Dora\u2014marked by both tenderness and frustration\u2014was extremely touching; it had much more verisimilitude and interest than David\u2019s later marriage.As another reviewer has pointed out, this book does have a quieter side. Beneath the brash and brazen giants, who lumber and lurch through these pages, runs a calm current of wistful nostalgia. In fact, Dickens often comes close to a sort of Proustian mood, as he has Copperfield disentangle his memories. Particularly when David is describing his childhood, with his silly mother and caring servant, or when he is describing the ravages of the Murdstones, or his awkward and difficult time at school, the tone is often tender and delicate, just as when Proust has his narrator describe the anxiety of wanting his mother to give him a goodnight kiss. The juxtaposition of these two moods, of caricature and remembrance, is I think what makes this book one of Dickens\u2019s strongest.I would like to add, as a kind of perverse afterthought, that a Freudian could have a festival analyzing this book. I am, myself, no disciple of that Austrian oddball; but I do think it interesting that David is born without a father, and has a stepfather who gives him such trouble; that David\u2019s two love interests are, as if reflected by a mirror, girls without mothers. And it doesn\u2019t take a psychoanalyst to note the similarity between Dora and David\u2019s mother; nor does it take a psychoanalyst to find it odd that David marries a girl he called, throughout the whole book, \u201csister.\u201d What to make of all this, I cannot say; but I thought it worth including.In any case, I have come away from this book with a pleasant stock of memories, and a new respect for, and interest in, the good Dickens. What is so wonderful about Dickens, I think, is that he is so brilliant and yet so readable. I cannot help grouping Dickens along with Shakespeare and the Beatles, as an artist capable of both keeping the scholars busy and the audience laughing. That, to me, is the mark of the highest genius."}, {"userName": "LENA TRAK", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51989964-lena-trak", "userReview": "What a lovely story!

How good is he? Is he as good as Tolstoy? No, he's not as good as Tolstoy. As good as Dumas? No. Hugo? Let's call it a tie. What about other Brits? Well, he's not even close to George Eliot. He's about as good as Thomas Hardy.He has a better feel for what it's like to be poor than most of those authors, and that's a big plus for him; even if you don't like poor people, Dickens' willingness to dive into the alleys makes a nice change from all those Victorian parlors. His characters are often caricatures, but they're effective, memorable ones. His understanding of human nature comes with sharp sarcasm and a bottomless supply of sympathy. He loves underdogs. He doesn't love Jews. He appears to have some weird ideas about women - see Betsey Trotwood and of course Miss Havisham.His main characters often disappear - never more than in David Copperfield, where many characters can't be bothered to remember the protagonist's name if they remember him at all. DC is variously called Trot, Daisy, and - by his own awful wife - Doadie. His supporting characters are better, and his villains are best. Uriah Heep basically walks away with David Copperfield.His plots rely heavily on the kind of coincidence peculiar to 19th century writers, and they're usually telegraphed a mile away, which doesn't keep them from being enormously entertaining and satisfying. He has a tendency to go on about legal bullshit to a fairly eye-glazing degree.His prose is generally unpretentious and effective, with brief spurts of incredible skill and beauty. He likes describing weather, as in the virtuoso opening of Bleak House. That and the dizzying opening of Tale of Two Cities (\"It was the best of times...\" and then it goes on for, like, ever) are audacious stuff.He's badly sentimental. You've probably heard the quote from Oscar Wilde, \"One would have to have a heart of stone to read the death of [character from different book] without dissolving into tears of laughter.\" It's best to just skim passages involving death or love; they're unsalvageably corny.He's a very good author. David Copperfield is a very good book, but it reads as practice for Great Expectations, which deals with a similar plot and themes better and much more concisely. Great Expectations is the best Dickens I've read. This is good, and Dickens is quite good. I find myself not needing to think about him all that often.Appendix: Dickens' influencesIf you're interested: at one point David Copperfield reels off a list of his favorite literary characters. Here are the books he's referring to:- Adventures of Roderick Random (1748), Tobias Smollett- Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751), Tobias Smollett - Expedition of Humphry Clinker (1771), Tobias Smollett (Chuck liked Smollett, huh? This one is supposed to be his best.)- Tom Jones, Henry Fielding (1749)- Vicar of Wakefield (1762), Oliver Goldsmith- Gil Blas, Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage (1715 - 1735), \"the last masterpiece of the picaresque genre\" - Robinson Crusoe, Daniel Defoe (1719)"}, {"userName": "Whitaker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1415047-whitaker", "userReview": "Top Ten Tips to Young Ladies of Marriageable Age by Charles Dickens10.\tGiggle alot.

It was bought by my father in 1964 (oh how I love old books!). This book by Charles Dickens is definitely a masterpiece! Although the author has died long ago, but I believe that his books and novels still live within us because of their marvelous concept and breathtaking events. And David Copperfield is certainly not an exception. It is said that this book is a reflection of the author\u2019s life and that makes it more meaningful I feel. The story traces the life history of David from his childhood to his adulthood. Dickens tells the quintessential tale of growing up. He brought the most colourful cast of characters that have their own personalities, motives, interests and sense of humour. Through the story, David grows up. He learns about the world, love, and human nature. He witnesses the miracles of life, and the tragedies of death. In turn, I feel the readers learn about such things as well. We see the world clearly through David's eyes.Even though the story is being narrated by an older and wiser David, the readers still experience events how David had experienced them the first time. The chapters where we observe David's childhood precisely allow us to see the environment through a child's trusting eyes. David is susceptible to making mistakes in life and being naive. He is a good and honorable person with a moral conscience, but he is just as susceptible to the vices of this world as everybody else. But this is part of growing up too, isn't it?Overall, I liked it very much. I felt the atmosphere it was giving and there were deep characters, which really helped in the story. Definitely a must-read classic!"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "A thoroughly charming and uplifting tale of an orphan who grew up through much hardship and travail in Victorian England. By pluck and good luck he finds the right people to support and inspire him, and to love and to protect in turn, and thereby approach his ambition to become \u201cthe hero of his own life.\u201d It\u2019s long, but it fulfills the quota for books you don\u2019t mind lingering with, where each chapter in my Libravox audiobook version whetted my interest for the next. In the serialized version Dickens wrote this in, its 64 chapters must have spun people along for many months. Each chapter leaves the seeds of wanting to find another step in David\u2019s success in bypassing or surmounting the slings and arrows that fate and the author assails him with. It\u2019s not exactly the \u201cPerils of Pauline.\u201d I just came to look forward to him outsmarting the malevolent characters that get their hooks in him, foiling the schemes of exploiters of his generous spirit, and progressing toward a stable love relationship. It\u2019s been a long time since I read Dickens, and I was surprised that this wasn\u2019t more \u201cDickensian\u201d. By which most mean a tale full of poor people tormented and downtrodden from inequities of Victorian society. We do get a brief period after David\u2019s sweet simpleton of a mother marries the evil Murdstone, who subjects them both to a tyrannical household with his vicious live-in sister calling a lot of the shots. A violent response on his part while getting an unjust beating gets him sent to a cruel boarding school for unruly children. That part clearly foots the bill for Dickensian. As does his fate of being consigned at about age 10 to work in the family sweatshop, a wine factory on the seedy Thames waterfront. When his one new friend, his landlord Micawber gets sent to debtor\u2019s prison and a mother no longer on the scene (mum\u2019s the word), he hits the bottom of despair. In a most triumphant and brave action, he decides to seek greater expectations by running away and successfully begging his great aunt Betsy of Dover to take him in. Betsy is the first rung of people who make a ladder for young David to get on in life. He gets to go to a school where teachers inspire him, especially the headmaster Dr. Strong. Staying in the household of Betsy\u2019s lawyer brings him the beginnings of a lifelong friendship with his daughter Agnes, whom he finds always guide him \u201cupwards\u201d to the right moral choices. By his late teens an apprenticeship as \u201cproctor\u201d doing administrative work in a law office is his ticket to autonomy, while success in selling stories for magazines in the beginning of a passage toward making a living from writing. There was no one big cloying romance on David\u2019s journey, but a succession of partial hits and misses. First he yearned for his tender childhood playmate Emily from his lucky childhood sojourns with his nanny\u2019s family of fisher folk in Yarmouth. As an adult he falls for simple, sweet Dora, whom he marries out of mutual devotion. It\u2019s up to us to regret that she is not his intellectual equal. In later life, that level of match is achieved with Agnes, who has secretly pined for him for many years but came to accept his notion of her as like a sister. Dickens dodges excess sentimentality in his wholesome plot through the surprises and comic touches of a bevy of eccentric characters, among them David\u2019s most sustained friends. Long before Freud and personality theory was developed, Dickens was masterful in capturing all the ways that people adopt odd and even paradoxical behavior on the stage of life. For example, with the character Mr. Dick we get a certifiable nut obsessed with King Charles I, writing his own memorial, and kite-flying, but who is also admirable, loyal, and wise with advice to David and Betsy, who provides him haven as a boarder. His former landlord Micawber continues to be a steadfast friend to David, despite often being a basket case of anxiety over his financial straits. The bad guys in the tale are beset by odd quirks that humanize them beyond serving as nemeses for our hero. Finally, I got to experience the infamous Uriah Heep in action, a fawning sycophant whose pretension to humbleness barely obscures his passive-aggressive egotism, greed and manipulative scheming against Agnes\u2019 father. While David is subject to murderous internal thoughts over Heep, Micawber can\u2019t keep his anger from taking stuttering flight aloud:\u201cI'll put my hand in no man's hand,' said Mr. Micawber, gasping, puffing, and sobbing, to that degree that he was like a man fighting with cold water, 'until I have\u2014blown to fragments\u2014the\u2014a\u2014detestable\u2014serpent\u2014HEEP!

And as a jaded reader of violent thrillers, war stories, and tales of sexual obsession, I was surprised to be touched so deeply by Dickens periodic recourse to simple and tender scenes that reflected the basic goodness of David and the people special to him. Such rewards are worth considering by all those who have long put off reading this classic."}, {"userName": "Paula W", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13286533-paula-w", "userReview": "I read this at the same time I read Ready Player One and A Game of Thrones. Those are super exciting, grab your hair and run around, can't put the book down adventure stories. *whispers* This was better. It was a slow read for me. Nothing super exciting happens. There are no cliffhangers at the end of each chapter. But it was GOOD. Dickens outdid himself here. Probably my second favorite of his, behind Bleak House but ahead of Great Expectations. And the last one I still rated 5 stars."}], "description": "David Copperfield, by Charles Dickens, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics.
