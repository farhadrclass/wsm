How can I put this lightly?Generation Dead is Twilight, but with zombies instead of vampires. And it's just as terrible. To wit:Meet Phoebe. She's a goth girl! (How 1999!) Phoebe listens to so many cool bands, like This Mortal Coil and Bronx Casket Company. We know this because author Daniel Waters assures us every fifteen pages that he is an expert on his goth rock. Phoebe also writes poetry! It's really, really terrible poetry, too!Meet Adam. Phoebe lives next door to him. He's a football player! But they're BFF anyway! He's so forward thinking! And he has a crush on her! Does she like him?! Sometimes when Adam and Phoebe need a heart-to-heart, they toss around the Frisbee. Now that's character development!Meet Margi. She's Phoebe's BFF, too! And also a goth girl! But she's, like, not as open-minded as Phoebe. She also talks a lot. Sometimes this annoys Phoebe!! OMG!Meet Tommy. He's dead. That's right. Dead. You see, some teenagers are returning from the dead. Only teenagers and only in America. Do we know why? No! It's just, like, happening! This freaks most people out, but not Phoebe! She's perfectly fine with it (because she's goth!!!) and she ropes Margi and Adam into joining an outreach program to help understand the 'differently biotic'. Also, Phoebe is totes crushing on Tommy! But trouble's a-brewing... ... and I wish I could divulge in every sordid detail, but I've already wasted hours of my life reading and/or thinking about this book. What I will say is this: Waters writes with about as much flair as a zombie. Despite having a clever and potentially amusing idea, he mangles the narrative by shifting character point-of-view, often in a single paragraph. On top of that, he strings together multiple red herrings without ever explaining a single one and (much like Stephenie Meyer), his narrative trundles along for 350 pages before it occurs to him to have a denouement. His worst offense, though, is bludgeoning the reader with didactic, ham-fisted observations about prejudice, which, given the context, could have been searing. Instead it is delivered in absurd statements like, \"Senator Mallory from Idaho introduced [The Undead Citizens Act:] by comparing differently biotic people to illegal immigrants.\" (Waters follows this observation up with... nothing. It's dropped as quickly as it's introduced.)Some idiot from Kirkus Reviews had the audacity to liken Daniel Waters to John Green. I would like to bathe that reviewer in the rivers of projectile vomiting I spewed after reading the treacly, sappy ending to this godawful book (and thinking about all the 390 pages of garbage that came before it)."}, {"userName": "Emma (Miss Print)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75857-emma-miss-print", "userReview": "In its Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that separate schools for black and white students were unconstitutional. The schools for whites were often superior to their counterparts for black students and consequently the separate schools offered very different educational opportunities. This ruling was key to the civil rights movement and efforts to end segregation.On September 3, 1957, nine black students were barred from entry into Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. By September 23, after another court decision ruled that Arkansas\u2019 governor could not keep them out, the Little Rock Nine were able to begin their school year in the white high school. President Eisenhower also sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to help protect the black students from harassment that ranged from insults to acid being thrown into one student\u2019s face.Eight of the Little Rock Nine finished the school year at the Central High. In May of 1958 Ernest Green graduated from the school, the only minority in his graduating class of 602 students.Fifty years later, Daniel Waters\u2019 debut novel Generation Dead offers a new take on integration and the fight for civil rights. In Oakvale, Connecticut parents and students alike are worried about the new students transferring to Oakvale High to benefit from the school\u2019s program of integration. Some of the new students are minorities, some of them are not. The reason all of the new students prove worrisome to some locals is more fundamental: The new students are dead.All over the country, dead teenagers are waking up and rejoining the living\u2014more or less. Called \u201cliving impaired\u201d or \u201cdifferently biotic\u201d by a politically correct society, many of the undead kids prefer the term \u201czombie.\u201d No one knows why some teenagers come back and some don\u2019t. The only certainty is that everything changed the moment these zombies began trying to reconnect with the world of the living.Unfortunately, some (living) people would prefer to have the zombies stay dead. Permanently. Everyone child knows that names can never hurt them, but for undead teens that don\u2019t heal sticks and stones suddenly seem much more dangerous, especially when the government has no laws to protect differently biotic citizens. After all, citizenship is supposed to expire when the citizen does, isn\u2019t it?In Generation Dead integration doesn\u2019t start with a court decision detailing undead rights. Instead it starts with Tommy Williams trying out for the football team. Dead for about a year, no one expects Tommy to survive tryouts, let alone make the team. Except that he does.Suddenly, the zombies don\u2019t seem quite so different. Phoebe Kendall, a traditionally biotic (albeit pale) student, realizes that better than anyone as she begins to observe Tommy and the other living impaired students at her school including Tommy and Karen (the girl featured on the novel\u2019s cover and possibly this reviewer\u2019s favorite character). The more Phoebe sees of zombies like Tommy and Karen, the more they seem like any normal teenager, well mostly.No one questions Phoebe\u2019s motivations for befriending Tommy until it begins to look like the two of them are more than friends. Margi, Phoebe\u2019s best friend and fellow Goth, can\u2019t understand what Phoebe could see in a dead boy. Every time her neighbor Adam sees Phoebe with Tommy, he can\u2019t help but wonder why she doesn\u2019t feel the same way about him when he\u2019s actually alive.Eventually Margi and Adam come around, forming their own tentative bonds with the zombies in their midst. Meanwhile, other students at Oakvale remain hostile. Determined to make sure that the dead students invading their school stay dead for good this time, they set a vicious plan into motion that will irrevocably change everything for Phoebe and her friends\u2014dead and alive.Written in the third person, Waters alternates viewpoints throughout the novel. Each of the main characters mentioned here, specifically Phoebe and Adam, have sections of the novel related from their perspective. The novel even features narration from one of the students strongly opposed to the zombie presence in Oakvale. This technique, aside from demonstrating Waters\u2019 masterful writing skills, offers a fully informed perspective on the events of the novel with its variety of viewpoints.Upon first glance, this book looks like a quirky but not necessarily serious book. A cover with a dead cheerleader wearing biker books can have that effect on readers. And yet, even though the story is about zombies, it isn\u2019t just another fun book. Filled with smart writing and an utterly original story, Generation Dead also adds to the ongoing conversation about tolerance and equality suggesting that people often have more in common than not. Even with zombies.You can find this review and more on my blog Miss Print"}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "Phoebe Kendall is your typical goth girl - she wears dark clothes, applies pale makeup, and paints her nails black. What sets her apart from the crowd is that she is in love with a dead boy, named Tommy Williams. All around the nation dead teenagers have been rising from their graves and practically rebooting their souls. They are also called zombies, living impaired, differently biotic, etc. Although most of them have to wait a few minutes before forming a sentence, a special few can function almost as well as normal humans. Tommy Williams likes to play football and is also a great writer - and somehow Phoebe is attracted to him.Generation Dead's cover is horrible. It really doesn't pertain to the book at all, and I was almost embarrassed to walk around with it. Anyway, I thought the book itself was good. I liked the concept and execution of the plot. I find most of the characters easy to relate to. I also liked how Waters made a seemingly terrifying story (dead teenagers coming back to life and being hunted) almost humorous in a way.However, there were things I didn't like too. The ending was abrupt and clearly leads to a sequel. I found a grammatical error or two. And sometimes the characters were a bit too predictable. But other than those few qualms, Generation Dead was a refreshing and enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "A Filthy Youth groupie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1323807-a-filthy-youth-groupie", "userReview": "This book was so good! It is both a fantasy and a romance book. You can't just put it in one genre, which is what I like.This book was great!I loved Tommy, but Adam was so sweet!Throughout this book, I wanted to kill Pete! He was so mean to all the DB kids! And when he killed Evan I started cying.Then he killed Adam.After I read the part where he died, I set the book down. Then I started crying hysterically. I just kept saying \"No! He can't die! He can't. He was so nice. He can't die!\"I wanted to scream, but my mom would have freaked out!I think the author will write a sequel because the ending is left open. There is so much more that could be added to the end of the story that writing a second book would be easy.We still need to find out what wil happen between Phoebe and Tommy. And what will happen between her and Adam. Plus, I need to find out if Pete got away with killing Adam. I mean, you can't just let him get away with killing him."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1310688-kristi", "userReview": "You\u2019ve heard of Generation \"X\" and Generation \"Y.\" Get ready for Generation Dead. Generation Dead being known for its, well, undead. Science can\u2019t explain it, and no one really knows why it happens, but American teenagers are coming back to life. Known to the living as differently biotic or the living impaired. These zombie teenagers try to \"live\" their undead lives, but as with any group of people that vary from the norm, there are always prejudices.Phoebe, a Goth. girl, finds herself unexpectedly drawn to one of these so-called living impaired students, Tommy Williams. Her best friend Margi, thinks she is crazy, but Margi\u2019s feeling for the undead are more complicated than a general dislike. Then there is Phoebe\u2019s neighbor and childhood friend, Adam. Adam has finally realized his feeling for Phoebe, but he still can\u2019t find the courage to tell her. Of course it doesn\u2019t make the situation any easier when he discovers Phoebe is crushing on the dead kid.Phoebe talks Margi and Adam into joining a work study at the Hunter Foundation, which is centered around the undead phenomenon. Unfortunately not everyone tries to be as open minded. There aren\u2019t any laws protecting the living impaired and they are being singled out and sometimes killed again. When a student makes a personal vendetta to take out the living impaired and anyone associated with them, the situation can only end in tragedy.Generation Dead went above and beyond what I was expecting. Sure it is about the dead, but there are so many underlying messages in this book. Prejudice is something that is very apparent, and is something that we deal within reality on a daily basis. There is a part in the book in chapter 16, where they have a guest speaker so to sort in their undead studies program, basically they are discussing how they can acclimate the undead into society. I have to say that the dialogue of the speaker, totally blew me away. I think I read it maybe three of four times and I just kept thinking, if only, if only acceptance and change were and could be that easy, the world would be a better place. But anyway, as for the rest of the story, characters were beyond three dimensional, I felt like I knew these kids, and they continued to develop throughout the entire story, I mean literally up until the last page, I loved it! The plot was totally original and kept me turning the pages until the late hours of the night. I love Waters writing style, it\u2019s engrossing yet simple, can that even be possible! The story was full of wit and humor, and I was totally captured! Obviously I really liked/love this book. It comes out on May 6th and I strongly suggest you pick up a copy. There is just something about it, it\u2019s different and fresh!"}, {"userName": "amber", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/207962-amber", "userReview": "2.5 - I really wanted to like this book. YA, zombies, cool cover - how could I not love it? I expected a funny story judging by all of the reviews and I think that is where the let down happened. This book is quite serious. It's really about intolerance and how people hate. There is startling zombie violence throughout the book. There are funny parts but overall this is not a lighthearted read. This is not a bad book but it wasn't what I was expecting. After the abrupt ending, I'm left feeling sad and kind of letdown."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "(Source: I own a copy of this book.)Some teenagers in America are dying, and then becoming reanimated. The description the government is using is \u2018living impaired\u2019 but the other kids just call them Zombies.Phoebe is a Goth, and seems to be developing an attraction to one of the zombies called Tommy.Can a norm and a zombie be together though? And what will everyone else say if they do start a relationship?This was an okay story, but it was a bit dull at times.Phoebe was a bit of an odd character. I understand that love isn\u2019t easy, and that people don\u2019t necessarily have a choice over who they love, but extending that to a zombie is just a little too much like necrophilia for me.The storyline in this was okay, but it was a bit too slow. Not a lot happened for a 400 pages book, and it seemed to take a long while to get through. I got the idea of trying to help the \u2018living impaired\u2019 to become accepted members of society, but I could also see how difficult that was going to be, and I wasn\u2019t surprised that some members of society were hailing the living dead as the first sign of an impending apocalypse.There were a few events in this book that I\u2019m guessing where supposed to be exciting, but I can\u2019t say I was really excited, and at times I really couldn\u2019t believe how long it took these kids to work out what was going on, as I seemed to know way ahead of them!There was some romance in this, but I just couldn\u2019t get past the fact that Tommy was a zombie. I had this problem with \u2018Warm Bodies\u2019, although I have to say that this book wasn\u2019t as bad as that one. Tommy was less zombie-like than expected I suppose, and I could see how Phoebe might be attracted to him, but still; necrophilia. What liking Tommy boils down to is fancying a corpse, which is just wrong I\u2019m afraid. Vampires are one thing, but zombies are something else entirely.The end to this was basically a big cliff-hanger. I suppose I should be grateful that I already have the next book ready to read, but those next 400 pages are looking quite long right about now.Overall; an okay, if overly long story,6.5 out of 10."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2390536-amy", "userReview": "Possible one of the worst books I have ever forced myself to finish. It starts out as a typical teen sci-fi book about american teens who have started to rise from the grave. It merges into the authors barely disguised soap box rant about society and racism (for which the story falters and becomes a very distant second priority). When the focus finally returns to the story ( in the last dozen pages) the author hurredly whaps a bow on the ending saying that the reason some zombies are more capable than others is ..... love. He then shoots, kills, and ressurects a main character on the last page before the book abruptly ends. I am a well known lover of the paranormal and the cheesy, but this book surpasses even my high tolerance for cheese. I rank this a boo and a hiss."}, {"userName": "Trisha", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1238273-trisha", "userReview": "I expected a light zombie book.Instead I got a pretty deep look into prejudice and \"social acceptable terms\" and all kinds of political soapbox discussions about accepting kids who've died and how to change society to accept them. Near the end, it finally became more about the character and I enjoyed that more. I especially don't like the POV changes. They are mid-chpater and mid-paragraph sometimes. It's jarring and complete distracts from the story. A simple break squiggly, change in chapter, etc, would make the transition so much easier."}, {"userName": "Greta is Erikasbuddy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3267545-greta-is-erikasbuddy", "userReview": "Welps! I finally did it! I read \nGeneration Dead\n! And while most of you have reviewed this book I relly won't go into too much detail.Basically:If you are a teenager and you die you can come back to life. Small Town school is now over-populated with zombies and it's a regular Civil Rights Movement for equal equlity. Parents and kids aren't too thrilled about the new students but there is a group of kids that is willing to chain arms and go all \"Occupy Wall Street\" with them.It's pretty much a new form of racism that puts the living against the dead.Ok ok... So, yeah... if you haven't read the book then that won't make much sense but I'm not really wanting to get into it because trust me... EVERYONE has reviewed this book.I've been told by some of my friends that I need to read this. That they uber love and they think that I will too. Sadly, this book wasn't really for me. I found it a bit too middle school for me. Like, for instance, there is a gang called the PAIN CREW that is just a bunch of football bullies that want to inflict PAIN on their rivals. Uhh... and they call themselves THE PAIN CREW. THat just seemed a bit Middle Schoolish to me.Another thing was two girls that called themselves WEIRD SISTERS. Again... Middle School. I can't really remember having GANGS and CREWS like that back in high school. But I can totally remember that kind of stuff in Middle School.So, in my opinion this book should have been toned down to a middle grade level. I just wonder what sixteen year old would love this book. Maybe a fourteen year old, but I talked to my son about it and he wanted to know if the zombies ate brains or flesh or turned other people into zombies by biting them and when I told him \"NO\" he then deemed the book Lame.But I have to admit. The one theory they have about the kids coming back as zombies due to immunizations is very clever. Kudos to the author for thinking that one up.Now, the characters.I really didn't know what to expect when reading this book. I felt that it was either going to be like DARK MOON DIARY or maybe some form of MONSTER HIGH. I think I probably would have liked it better if it had been.Now... what about them characters?Pete reminded me of ROGER KLOTZ from DOUG.\nThe Pain Crew can be played by Roger's gang.\nAdam reminded me of ARCHIE ANDREWS.\nAnd all the girls were basically like MONSTER HIGH DOLLS but with huge vocabularies.\nNow, back to the DARK MOON DIARY.... I really think that I would have enjoyed this book more if it had been a comic book. Even a chibi kind of cute ToykoPop comic book. I know I would have loved it then. In booky wook form it just kinda bored me.\nCUTE!!The ENDINGI feel that the ending should have stopped around page 380 when Pete pulled the trigger. I don't think we should have known who was shot. That would have probably pushed my rating up a bit. Just for that one little bit.What about another?I don't know if I'll be able to read the next one. Darkfallen has told me that it is better but it's just another teenage book based at a school and I have such a problem with them unless they are comic books. I'm not sure I'll be able to handle it.Would I recommend this book?Well, I think a 12 or 13 year old would love this book. And I totally would let them read it. Sure, there is a tad bit of cussing but it's nothing that they aren't going to hear off tv. Plus, the book sets a good message about equal rights.What about me?Well, like I said, it was based around a school and I thought it was going to be more fun. I just didn't have fun with it. I tried it, gave it a spin, and now am going to pass it to my little neighbor girl down the street.It kind of had the feel of ABC FAMILY CHANNEL series. I'm not really into those but I'm sure if it was to become one it would be huge :)So not for me but maybe for you ;)"}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4878068-angela", "userReview": "This isn't a bad read. It's certainly not spectacular either though. I've read reviews where they have compared this novel with 'Twilight' but with zombies instead of vampires; it's not, it's better written than that, and nowhere near as annoying or cringe-worthy.The concept of the novel was good - I'm a big zombie fan and this is the first time I've read anything where the undead do not go shuffling around eating brains, but instead, try to incorporate themselves into living society as much as they can. If I'm honest, I much prefer the brain eating kind of zombie - they're much more fun.Generally speaking, this book is about the concept of hatred and acceptance, and Waters does give some nice philosophy and metaphors regarding both. It explores the prejudices between the living and the living dead, and draws interesting comparisons/parallels between racial discrimination. At first, this was handled quite well but then got so repetitive that I just became bored with it.What annoyed me most whilst reading this novel however, were the characters. They were all so stereotypical (e.g. the goth girl who has a 'thing' for the zombie boy, because of course all goths secretly harbour necrophiliac intentions and write emotional poetry). The writing wasn't overly impressive either but not so bad that it made me cringe. Also, near the end of the novel the editing, or lack thereof, becomes rather lax. The ending of the book was so predictable but sets it up quite nicely for the sequel. I did feel whilst reading this book that Waters was too busy trying to set the series up rather than focus on the individual novel, leaving the plot quite thin on the ground and a lot of things unexplained, such as WHY it is only American teenagers are returning from the dead (I'm assuming will be explained in the sequels but was still a disappointment that Waters did not go into much depth here).All in all, an ok read, but I'm certainly in no rush to read the sequels just yet."}, {"userName": "Brigid \u2729 Cool Ninja Sharpshooter \u2729", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/886144-brigid-cool-ninja-sharpshooter", "userReview": "Okay, I admit: I hated it for the first fifty-or-so pages. But it got better as it went along, and somewhere in the middle I found myself getting hooked. It wasn't as shallow as I expected it to be; in fact, parts of it were pretty sad and even powerful. I felt like it wasn't quite as good as it had the potential to be, though. It would've been REALLY good if the plot and characters had just been developed a LITTLE bit more. For most of the book, I kept asking, \"Wait, WHY are these kids coming back from the dead?!\" and it took me quite a while to realize that nobody actually knew why. For some reason, I was convinced that the kids were part of some weird science experiment or something. But anyway, the book never explains why this is happening.

One thing is clear, I am not reading the next one. Can't believe I spent my birthday reading this."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2465264-donna", "userReview": "I like my fiction as stories, first and foremost. I read fiction so that I can escape from the world churning around me. 99.9% of the time, authors write with some kind of meaning in their writing, a lot of that is subconscious. A lot of fiction writers write the story first but, without helping it, some kind of theme will usually emerge from the fun. That's fine. What I don't like is when my fiction is really just a ruse to beat people about the head with a message they \"should\" be learning. That, to me, is not the purpose of fiction. Fiction is escapism. What fun is it to escape pressing matters and run into the arms of . . . pressing matters? Boo.Yeah, I get it. Intolerance sucks. Idiocy sucks. Irrational thinking sucks. But why couldn't the story just be told instead of force-feeding the readers with the lesson of tolerance? People are people, no matter what their skin color is. And in this case, no matter what their pulse status is either. Ok. I get it. Stop stuffing it down my throat and just tell me the damn story. This aspect alone, of heavily infusing such an issue, really writing about an issue thinly veiled by a zombie story, really kept turning me off to the book. I just don't like being preached to. I really don't.However . . .I liked Pete's story. Not because he's a bastard but because there's more going on there than a love-in. He's probably the most dynamic human in the entire piece because he has this huge issue with Julie, this jealously that fuels him. It makes you wonder, \"what if she were to come back? would he be alright then?\" He's much more polarizing and much harder to figure out. You know what Adam's going to do. You know what Phoebe and Margi are going to do. You know what Tommy's going to do. But Pete . . . he could go berserk or he could punk out but what are his motivations? Is it because he hates zombies? Or because he's jealous because his love didn't come back like the rest of them? I absolutely love that dynamic about him, that polarizing effect of his personality. There is another side to him, the side that died with Julie but still rears up every once in a while. Him I'd like to follow around.The end of the book was in and of itself redeeming. Not because of the actions of the characters but because we finally get catapulted inside the head of a dead kid and we finally get to see, even though it's just for a second, what they really think, how they feel and how they want to act. It's truly terrifying; being trapped inside your own body and not being able to act or say what your brain so desperately wants to do. There's a disconnect with a fully functioning brain. How horrible is that? That is what interests me.This is where my science geek comes out. I get wrapped up in the nuances of situations like this. How are they not rotting? How did they come back? The brain controls muscle movement. If being dead means brain death, how are they able to move? Talk? Think? Play football? Love? Screw the story. Give me a book on just that and I'll be in heaven.But at the end of the day, even though I fully understand the glaring message this book is sending, it's not the same, is it? The racial divide in this country is about skin color. Nothing more than varying degrees of pigmentation in the epidermis. This book is about regenerated corpses. They are dead. No heart beat. No brain activity (for you are not legally dead until you are declared brain dead). They died, have risen from the dead and are now walking around. Yes, I understand the parallels of the lack of understanding. The sub-humanizing of Africans during the slave trade were equal parts ignorance and intolerance. Had those slave masters been tolerant enough to understand, they would have been made less ignorant. But in an age where we fully understand that a homo sapien is a homo sapien regardless of what the outside looks like, and we have scientific proof to substantiate that, how can the irrationality of being freaked the fuck out about reanimated corpses walking around be somehow illogical and ignorant? They're the walking dead.I love my best friend to death. But if she died and however long later appeared at my door, I wouldn't put it past myself to grab a shovel and start swinging. Why? BECAUSE SHE'S A REANIMATED CORPSE. There's a difference between an irrational fear and a rational fear. An irrational fear is being afraid of someone based solely on their skin color, especially in a day and age when we know better. A rational fear is being afraid of someone that just climbed out of their own grave. Yes, over time, when society learns the facts as to the whys and hows of the situation, the fear would subside but don't kid yourself to think too many people are going to have the first reactions of *hug* to someone that carries a legal death certificate, especially when the phenomena is just beginning. The bigger hurdle is moving beyond that initial knee jerk fear into the level of tolerance and eventual understanding. Some will be quicker to do it, yes, but I think nearly all will have the same intial reaction. I do get it. Same message as the color of skin but there's a big different between dark skin and no pulse.Aside from all of that, I felt the storytelling was a big robotic at times and a lot of the dialogue was stilted, especially amongst the teenagers. The reoccurrence of \"it is\" in speech really bugged me. Such a small thing, I know, but how often do you say \"it is\" instead of \"it's\"? It's simple things like contractions that can make dialogue more realistic. They don't have to be all slanged up but the propriety of a lot of the conversations just didn't jive with my realism flow.At the end of the day, this was one of those books that had enough in it to keep me reading to the end and has me intrigued to read the sequel. Kudos to Waters for using a unique turn to send a familiar message. It's not something I'm going to rush out and buy. I'll read it in my own time. But just the prospect of being able to read and see the story from behind the eyes of a zombie is far too good to resist. If you can get past the skull-smashing of the message 2x4 the novel has, it's a pretty decent read."}, {"userName": "Sarah Marie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6515737-sarah-marie", "userReview": "Generation Dead by Daniel WatersFirst in the Generation Dead series4 starsPhoebe Kendall is your typical high school Goth girl. She wears the clothes, the makeup, listens to \u201cGoth\u201d music, and loves black. She and her BFF, Margi, have a common bond when it comes to all things black and combat boots. Her best guy friend is Adam (who is finally realizing that he is in love with her and of course Phoebe is completely oblivious to this). Now she has mixed feelings toward a guy\u2026 but he\u2019s not just any guy. He\u2019s a zombie! Teenagers all around the U.S. have been sprouting out of graves and morgues, coming back to life. The catch is these zombies aren\u2019t after your brains they just want to be treated like they are still alive. It\u2019s refreshing to find a zombie book. Every now and then I need a break from vampires and werewolves for zombies or faeries or even witches. A friend of mine from school recommended this book to me and she was raving for a whole four minutes about how good it was and we have similar tastes so I decided that it was worth the shot. I then find out that my neighbor owned this book and she let me borrow it. Me being the book lover I am when I borrow books from people I try to read them as quickly as possible because I hate being separated from my books and I\u2019m sure people feel the same. Giving Generation Dead a chance was a great idea. This book is supposed to be paranormal, but I felt that it touched on an important issue we face at least once in our life, discrimination. A big part of this book was the discrimination against zombies. They were constantly called names, pushed around, harassed, rejected from groups and clubs. This book properly executed a touchy subject in a light way. The book focused mainly on Phoebe and Adam. Phoebe and Adam are childhood friends and Adam is starting to realize he has feelings for Phoebe that go beyond friendship. They both had alternating POVs, which I\u2019ll touch on my thoughts later. There was another POV, from Pete, one of the meanest guys in school. I\u2019ll talk about thoughts on POVS in character sections. The writing isn\u2019t the best writing, but it\u2019s easy to read and light.Whimsical Writing Scale: 3.5The main female character is Phoebe. Phoebe is supposed to be the star of this novel, but she seems to get just as much spotlight as even minor characters do. Phoebe was hard to connect to at times, but I still liked her character and thought she had an interesting voice. Phoebe wants peace between the zombies and people, but she realizes that it\u2019s easier said than done. I don\u2019t think Phoebe knows what she wants when it comes to boys. I felt that she loved Adam and Tommy only has friends. I know they are supposed to be her love interests, but it\u2019s hard for me to believe she could end up with either of these boys.Kick-Butt Heroine Scale: 4The main male characters are Adam and Tommy. Adam gets his own POV and I didn\u2019t like him at first, but as the story progressed and he became more accepting of zombies and broke away from what everyone else thought and became his own person I started to like him a lot more. He\u2019s a great guy but it takes a while to realize that. Tommy is the zombie boy. I liked Tommy just as much as I like Adam. I think he\u2019s a great character and I want to find out more about him because I feel like there\u2019s still more to him. The discrimination he faced in this novel was heartbreaking. I like both of these boys and if I had to choose who Phoebe ended up with in the end I\u2019d say neither because I like them and don\u2019t think they need to face more heartbreak or unfairness.Swoon Worthy Scale: Adam- 4.25 Tommy-4.25The Villain- Pete is the villain of this story and he gets his own POV. I love when villains get their own POV and I love even more when you don\u2019t know what their plans are for evil. A villain POV in YA is rare, at least to me it is become I haven\u2019t come across it often. Pete is a truly complex character. I hate him so much, but at the same time I want him to be happy. The one girl Pete loved more than anything died around the time that the zombies started to rise and he hoped she would rise too. Of course you can guess that didn\u2019t happen and then that\u2019s pretty much where his hate for zombies stemmed. Pete was already a bully and I think he\u2019ll always be one, but he is very discriminative towards zombies. Pete is a character that makes you think about what can cause such hate towards a race, religion, or disorder. He is the perfect villain for this story.Villain Scale: 4Margi is Phoebe\u2019s best friend and she annoyed me a lot, but I eventually started to like her more than I originally had. Karen and Colette were two zombies that were mentioned a lot in this novel. Karen was cool and I look forward to getting to know her in upcoming books and Colette is Phoebe and Margi\u2019s best friend. I think she should\u2019ve played a bigger role than she did. I felt she didn\u2019t get to shine like she should\u2019ve.Character Scale: 4.5This was a great novel and I feel like the only thing that really made it lack the five start rating was the lack of character depth. I think there could\u2019ve been more. I did enjoy the characters, but I also feel they were lacking. The problems talked about in this novel are well done and should be taken into consideration. Overall I enjoyed Generation Dead and that ending left me wanting to know what happens next.Plotastic Scale: 4.5Cover Thoughts: I like the cover. It\u2019s not a girl in a dress, yes she\u2019s in a cheer uniform, but I feel like it fits the story in a way. The cover is well done."}, {"userName": "The Lost Lola", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1139549-the-lost-lola", "userReview": "Story *** 3/5Zombies are now a fact of life. What was once considered the final journey taken by humans is no longer the case. Not all people who die are staying dead, but for some unknown reason, this phenomenom only occurs in teenagers. Now, the undead youth is forced into a world of hatred, discrimination, and fear, because the government has not yet given the undead basic human rights.Oakvale High prides itself in being a tolerant and accepting high school for the undead youth, and houses the largest number of undead in the world. Among the students here is gothic rebel Phoebe, who finds herself falling for the undead Tommy Williams. Her friends don't understand her reasoning, until Tommy begins to act more like a living person than an undead person after he tries out for the football team. But Phoebe's friends aren't the only ones who don't accept her new relationship, and she and Tommy find themselves the target of the most violent student at school.Over the course of the semester, the school impliments a new program to allow students to help promote tolerance among the \"differently biotic\" kids. While this new program of tolerance brings some of the traditionally biotic and biotically different youth together, the group begins to question the founder's motives.I thought the general idea of the plot was a great premise, and the differently biotic school program was such an interesting addition to the story, but then everything else fell flat. It became blindingly obvious early on that the term \"zombie\" could be used to describe anyone who has ever experienced prejudice before, and the novel took an annoyingly preachy turn far too soon which made me loose immediate interest. The relationship between Phoebe and Tommy was so bizarre, and they had no chemistry whatsoever. The scenes of violence towards the zombies were also very disturbing, and the book in its entirety just left me feeling grossed out and annoyed. I'm not sure which direction the author was planning on taking, but I find myself not at all interested in reading any more in this series.Characters *** 2/5Adam- Phoebe's neighbor and best friend. He has strong feelings for Phoebe, but of course she doesn't notice. He's on the football team with Pete, and was partly responsible for crippling a fellow student when the coach ordered them to. He dies while saving Phoebe from a gunshot at the end of the novel, but immediately returns as a zombie.Colette- Phoebe and Margi's former friend, she died by drowning in the lake while out with them one day. When she \"returned,\" she was rejected by both her friends and family, and has left her feeling isolated.Margi- Phoebe's other best friend and fellow goth. She doesn't really want to be a part of the whole dead/undead tolerance program, but joins out of guilt for being responsible for the death of now undead Colette.Pete- The football coach's go-to man and former friend of Adam's. He hates the undead with a passion, and is responsible for killing Evan, and undead kid. He develops an obsession for Phoebe because she reminds him of his old girlfriend, Julie, who died but never came back. He is ordered to take out as many undead kids as possible, and nearly succeeds at the end of the novel, but ends up accidentally shooting Adam instead.Phoebe- The goth chick with the heart of gold. She falls for Tommy early on, but then begins to realize that he may be using her just to show that the dead and undead can get along. She was partly responsible for Colette's death, but very little is revealed about the situation and leaves me wondering why it was brought up in the first place.Tommy Williams- An undead kid and Phoebe's love interest. He has been trying to promote tolerance for a long time, and even keeps a running blog about his life as an undead teen. He helped found the Haunted House, a place where undead kids can live and hang out safely. He died in a car accident with his father, and now lives with his mother, Faith.Writing *** 2/5The writing was sloppy and jumped around far too much. I think the novel would have worked better if it were told from one perspective rather than both Adam's and Phoebe's. A lot of characters are introduced, but few of them get any story, so it got a little confusing keeping track of everyone. That and everyone had such horribly generic names, it was hard to keep a who's who list. Daniel Waters also had a bad habit of writing in red herrings and not running anywhere with them, which was really frustrating, especially since I have no interest in reading the next novel. Definitely potential in this work, but the execution was AWFUL.Content *** 16+ (alcohol, sexuality, violence)"}, {"userName": "Team.Dixon.364", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59630159-team-dixon-364", "userReview": "\"No esperes a morir para amar\""}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2496802-natasha", "userReview": "Generation Dead is an amazing new YA series. I was instantly hooked. I love that it has action and it's paced, but it's really interesting. Yo learn a whole new life and the story behind the 'living impared'(or zombies) which the zombies rather be called(by those who mean no harm in the word).  The characters are easy to get attached too, Daniel Waters really grasped teenagers(male and female). I like Phoebe and Adams humor towards eachother and how they can trust eachother with stuff that they don't trust anyone else with. And Phoebe and Tommy are also good together, because they truly want a friendship even though it's looked upon strangly. It's an interesting relationship and I cannot wait to see how all the relationships grow in the second in the installment. Synopsis:All over the country, a strange phenomenon is occuring. Some teenagers who die aren't staying dead. Termed \"living impaired\" or \"differently biotic,\" they are doing their best to fit into a society that doesn't want them. Fitting in is hard enough when you don't have the look or attitude, but when almost everyone else is alive and you're not, it's close to impossible. The kids at Oakdale High don't want to take classes or eat in the cafeteria next to someone who isn't breathing. And there are no laws to protect the differently biotic from the people who want them to disappear - for good. With her pale skin and goth wardrobe, Phoebe has never run with the popular crowd. But on one can believe it when she falls for Tommy Williams, the leader of the dead kids. Not her best friend, Margi, whose fear of the differently biotic is deeply rooted in guilt over the past. And especially not her neighbor, Adam, the star of the football team. Recently, Adam has realized that his feelings for Phoebe run much deeper than just friendship. He would do anything for her; but what if protecting Tommy is the one thing that would make her happy?"}, {"userName": "Rachael", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1028829-rachael", "userReview": "Get ready for the next sensation: waking up after you\u2019ve died.

As you may have guessed by the title, Generation Dead is a zombie story. In the movies the zombie is usually the antagonist, who spends most of its time trying to eat living humans; however, in Generation Dead, the zombies are trying to integrate into society. At this point the only zombies are teenagers, who come back after dying. Science cannot explain why they come back to life or why some of them are more animated than others.As you might expect, there are some who are happy to have their loved one back and others who quickly abandon them out of fear. Preachers are actively saying that the dead are a sign of the coming apocalypse based in the idea that zombies are unholy. Because zombies have been declared dead they have no rights and this means that killing them is not a crime, nor is discriminating against them in many forms. This is a book primarily about discrimination and prejudice. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s especially a love story (though there are elements of that) or even a YA school story - this is about discrimination, how people deal with bigotry, how bigotry affects people and the different forms of bigotry.I\u2019ve said before that the whole \u201cfantastic\u201d prejudice theme is overdone - and it is. But I\u2019m not going to slam a book for that because I also think it can be a decent way to explore prejudice if it is done right.Sadly, I don\u2019t think this book did that.It touched on many issues but didn\u2019t really explore them. It\u2019s also a book about prejudice told entirely through the eyes of people who don\u2019t experience the prejudice - and oh boy have we seen them before.

For example there\u2019s a scene where a \u201ccelebrity\u201d gives the group a pep talk. It was funny break from all the drama and nonsense.It was whole stereotypical characters were what mostly turned me off though. The hot, goth girl who is technically the social outcast and the super kind football player who happens to the childhood best friend. The majority of the characters I felt were two-dimensional. No true flaw, almost perfection. There was however a character that was compelling to read. It was the so called villain, Pete. He had the most spunk, the most depth, the most charisma I must say.There was also this one awkward scene that I felt had no place in the novel, the scene with Margi and Adam. I won\u2019t go in further depth with this one since some people despise spoilers. Speaking of scenes that had no place, about a third of the novel I felt could have been removed. It basically threw off the natural flow and just added weight to an almost good book.Overall: A huge upset on my part. Not to say this was an awful, horrible, disgusting book. It wasn\u2019t.

Waters never stopped developing each of his characters - they constantly evolved throughout the story and entertained me to the end and beyond. The plot was original and perfectly paced, keeping the reader turning the page to see what was coming next. The dialog was enjoyable and witty and incredibly realistic. Generation Dead is a quirky and surprisingly deep novel. Don't judge this book by it's cover (fabulous as it may be!)

I agree with most of them that it was a fun read, but there were too many things about this book that bothered me for me to say I liked it. I give this book a middle-of-the-road rating, and I'll explain what my fundamental problems with the book are, though I should say for the record that such things will not ruin the book for everyone--just did for me. My biggest problem with this book is that the concept is a neat idea but wasn't all that well carried out. It seemed almost like the author wanted to write about the social aspects of how dead people returning to life would affect society, but skipped the gritty details of what WOULD actually happen in between, moving right on to the fun part where dead kids are in your school. Consider this:Less than three years had passed since the phenomenon began and yet there was already this push to fight for zombies' equality as citizens. Before scientists knew what made this happen. Before they could tell if zombies were in fact unstable, dangerous, diseased, whatever. The way this book is structured, it seemed like the author thought it really was feasible that the scientific community would collectively shrug and let these kids go about their afterlives.I'm not saying I can't suspend disbelief about zombies in the first place, because that's the fun of it--it's just that since the book was written in a non-humorous, otherwise *realistic* fashion, it seems to be trying to frame how society really would react to dead people joining \"our\" ranks, and yet it misses some of the basic fibers of human nature.For an example, let's look at America's embarrassing history when it came to equal rights for blacks. When black and white schools were getting integrated, so many white people were furious that their kids had to go to school with blacks that they withdrew their children, and the black kids had to be escorted to school and protected by policemen, frequently holding back crowds of whites who yelled and threw things. And this is how they acted when the kids were actually protected by the law! Zombies, in this book, have no rights. They would fare far worse. Even in this supposedly enlightened era. Dead coming back to life is a LOT more of a fundamental change than learning next to someone with a different skin color. There would be upheavals on scales that are nearly inconceivable. But here are these kids facing some prejudice and physical danger but going largely unmolested to school shortly after waking up dead.And . . . how are they in school, exactly? They're not citizens. It's said they can't get driver's licenses or vote. But I suppose somehow they're able to be enrolled in school? No law can be requiring them to go (so one wonders why some of them are even there if they don't \"have\" to go), but even if they wanted to . . . would they really be allowed? I know visitors who aren't students sure had to jump through hoops to even be allowed inside the schools I worked at in college. Laws don't acknowledge these poor dead kids, so I find it hard to figure out why for no reason whatsoever some laws do seem to apply to them and some don't, depending on if it's convenient for the story's situation.It's stuff like this that made the world \"feel\" wrong to me. I did like the slice of life the author chose to portray. Phoebe and Adam's relationship was VERY well-done--their adolescent confusion was believable, and most of the character interaction was convincing; I think character-building is this author's strong point. Another good example was that prejudice existed on both sides; there were some zombies who didn't trust the \"traditionally biotic\" and treated them badly, so it was refreshing to see zombies were not just a bunch of sad, maligned, defenseless creatures who never did any hating of their own. But I was pretty disappointed in the worldbuilding.It would be obnoxious of me to demand that every question be answered, but it wasn't so much that the questions weren't answered that bothered me; what bothered me most is that there were several aspects of the story that made it seem impossible or improbable (even while suspending disbelief for kids coming back to life, of course), and no attempts were made to address these. Sorta like the author wanted to skip over some of the realistic ramifications of undead teens and skip right to the part where dead kids are an oppressed minority whose rights are only recognized by PC progressive types (three years after they started existing in the first place), complete with cheesy slogans on tee shirts.Stuff I'm not sure the author thought of:Zombies are repeatedly said not to breathe. How are they talking? I'm cool with it if there is a good explanation--like that they *can* breathe but don't need to to \"live,\" or they're talking some different way. But nobody ever tells you.Why would their eyes and skin lose pigment within a few minutes or hours of being dead? That doesn't happen to people who actually die. They don't suddenly become pale and lose their eye color. So why does it happen to zombies? I'm not saying it can't happen in the story, just that I would like some understanding of why besides \"it just does, because that's what zombies look like.\"Why do their hair and nails grow? They don't actually grow after death. That's a myth.I guess my bottom line here is to say that I would see the events in Generation Dead happening more realistically in *micro* if some of the *macro* issues had been thought through a little better. They wouldn't have had to be focused on--just either addressed peripherally or insinuated to have been. The author pointed out several times that the scientists don't have any clue what allows zombies to \"live\" and why zombiism only occurs in American (or Canadian!) teens--but saying no one knows how it works doesn't do it for me. The ramifications of the laws of physics and biology being violated in an otherwise rational world is not examined at all. Scientists would freak. Society would freak. And not calm down for a very long time. If they don't find the answer, you've got to show what happens when they don't find the answer.And if, somehow, the zombie phenomenon did NOT cause a widespread panic, and eventually things settled down to the point that they could begin to pursue their rights and enroll at your school, I think it would only be after there were a lot more answers. Look at how schools and society handled the concept of living with students who had AIDS when it was first showing up. The reaction was something like \"OMG what are the rules, can I get it from touching him, what if he bleeds on me, isn't AIDS a GAY DISEASE, hey wait you want MY KID to go to school with THAT?\" Now try multiplying the height of THAT by fifteen or so and you'll have the attitudes and reactions that'd be caused by walking, talking dead people. I don't demand that the zombie thing make scientific sense or anything; I just ask that the world depicted in a book is internally consistent, and I ultimately could not reconcile the concept with the reaction in this book.Just one more note: The book had a higher than average language glitch score (which isn't good). Editors and fact-checkers, please put on your glasses for the next edition. I caught \"peoples'\" instead of \"people's,\" a possessive used incorrectly with respect to someone's house, \"Badger's\" instead of \"Badgers,\" \"fifteen minute\" instead of \"fifteen minutes,\" and \"sight\" instead of \"site,\" and the first time I saw the word \"retina\" used when the author meant \"iris\" it startled me. Then he did it again later, which means I guess he thinks the colored part of the eye is called the retina. Retinas are on the inside of eyeballs. Really weirded me out when I thought we were seeing a zombie's retina, until I realized it was just a mistake.Most people who don't overthink everything and aren't as picky as I am will probably still enjoy this story, so read the other reviews and decide for yourself. Like I said, it's entertaining in micro and the characters are well-written while the concept is entertaining. I just think it could have been thought through a little better, and I have a sneaking suspicion that part of the reason an unrealistically short amount of time was allowed to go by was so we could still get these zombies into the schools when they weren't too much older than when they died. Since reality is skewed to make the premise work, I lost respect for it early on and that upset my ability to enjoy the book."}, {"userName": "Wren [t(he)y]", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11442507-wren-t-he-y", "userReview": "4.5 stars.Review to come"}, {"userName": "Sarah Marie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4429179-sarah-marie", "userReview": "Like many other readers, I found that the summary on the back of the book did not quite match its contense. It was advertised as a zombie love story, but instead its really all about segregation and hate. To be honest I thought this was a nice surprise because the resulting book I found to be much more original and interesting than had it been like a typical high school romance. I thought the concept of the teenage zombies ( or differently biotic) was alright, but its never going to catch on in popular fiction. One thing I hated about the zombies, was that only America was affected. If teenagers are going to start coming back to life, it will happen all over the world, isolating it in America was just plain stupid. I hope in further books when the cause of the zombies becomes evident, that the author gives a very good reason for why only American teenagers were effected, because otherwise the whole concept is flawed. Also, the thing about love giving zombies more life-like movements, was a bit iffy too. But thats maybe just because I'm a science girl, and a book has to do a lot to convince me that its supernatural creatures could realistically exist in the books own alternative reality. So overall, the zombies were not that great as supernatual creatures go.I quite liked Phoebe, she was a pretty good main character, and by half way in the book I was thinking about turning fully goth myself ( I'm only a goth on certain days of the week, when I feel like it). She was a very likable character, but I do have to say, her infatuation with Tommy Williams was a bit strange.At first I totally understand what she saw in him, he was mysterious and hot and dead ( we've all been there). And I thought that your typical young adult love triangle would result: Phoebe likes supernatural Tommy, normal Adam likes Phoebe, supernatural Tommy likes Phoebe, and Phoebe likes normal Adam as a freind. However by the end of the book, this was all turned on its head. *spoiler alert* It turned out Tommy didn't particularly like Phoebe, he was just looking for \"a girl\", so as a result, Phoebe didn't like him as much as she thought she did either. And then you have Adam, completely in love with Phoebe, who then dies before he gets to tell her. Next thing you know, normal, boring Adam becomes a Zombie, no longer fulfilling his love triangle role of the normal freind. This book took your common supernatural love triangle and turned the whole thing on its head!!At first I didn't find any appeal in Adam, but he kind of grew on me as the book progressed. At the beginning I thought I was going to love Tommy, but he never grew into the romantic hero I thought he would and by the end i thought he lacked a certain substance of character. Of course in the end it was Adam who became the romantic hero I had been looking for.Pete was quite a good baddie, in that, he was a baddie because of the trauma in his past and had a substantial reason for hating zombies. He was twisted and phsycologically disturbed, but then again, most baddies are. Pete was surprisingly just as three dimentional as Tommy and Adam and he was certainly more complex. So even though he was a baddie, the author still had some very good characterisation going on.Generation dead was...different. I don't think it will be very popular or win any awards, but it was quite a thought-provoking little read which deffinately fits the bill if you're looking for something a bit outside the normal supernatural young adult fiction."}, {"userName": "Nikki (Wicked Awesome Books)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2833134-nikki-wicked-awesome-books", "userReview": "I picked up Generation Dead by Daniel Waters about a year ago, but I just got around to reading it. The cover was the first thing that drew me in and I\u2019m glad I finally cracked it open.Generation Dead is Daniel Waters\u2019 first YA novel, but you wouldn\u2019t know that by reading it. He did a very good job crafting a witty, funny, and sometimes saddening story about kids who die, but don\u2019t stay dead. The kids come back as zombies (or differently biotic).The YA genre is bountiful with stories about zombies, but Generation Dead is handled in different way. Phoebe is the main character in this zombie-ridden story. I found it kind of funny and ironic that in a school that has more zombie kids than most others, Phoebe insists on keeping her Goth look. At least she stays true to herself. Her best friend Margi, is quite similar to Phoebe, but she is extremely wary of the zombie kids. Adam Layman, Phoebe\u2019s good friend and popular jock, plays the role of the oft ignored, but completely lovesick guy friend, but that didn\u2019t bother me. I actually enjoyed his character more than Tommy Williams, the zombie that Phoebe has undetermined \u2018feelings\u2019 for.I enjoyed the book, but I noticed that the clich\u00e9d high school cliques are present throughout the novel. Adam is a jock and Phoebe is a goth chick. They are very close friends, but at the start of the novel, Adam won\u2019t even acknowledge her at school. Aside from that, Phoebe is sympathetic towards the outsider zombies and she even begins to develop feelings for one. At the same time, she is completely oblivious to the fact that Adam has more than friendly feelings for her. Margi is the bright light within the book. She is unique in her feelings towards the zombies because she has a legitimate reason to feel the way she does. Oakvale High School attempts to integrate the zombie students with the regular students through a special program that the aforementioned characters all join. It is through the program that the plot advances.Generation Dead is peppered with interesting characters and the stories about some of the zombie students deaths can be upsetting. I found Collette to be the most heartbreaking of the bunch. I liked this new spin on zombies and I\u2019m interested to see where the story goes from here. Hopefully we get to know why these kids are coming back and why it\u2019s only happening to kids in America. I also hope the sequel delves more into the school program and the research they are doing because it seems like there could be something nefarious going on behind the scenes.One thing that did start to bother me after a while was the pauses in speech that the zombies had. It\u2019s only a tiny aspect of the novel, but the constant use of ellipsis just aggravated me after a while. The premise was also somewhat predictable, but the writing, storytelling, and the more interesting characters are strong enough to make up for that. The last 100 pages or so really had me hooked. It amazes me how some of the teens act in Generation Dead and the ending is certainly not an exception.Generation Dead was a good read. Not the best thing I\u2019ve ever read, but worthy of buying. There\u2019s already a follow-up out titled Kiss of Life. I haven\u2019t read that one yet, but I\u2019ll be picking it up soon. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what happens after such an explosive ending in Generation Dead."}], "description": "Phoebe Kendall is just your typical Goth girl with a crush. He's strong and silent and dead. All over the country, a strange phenomenon is occurring. Some teenagers who die aren't staying dead. But when they come back to life, they are no longer the same. Feared and misunderstood, they are doing their best to blend into a society that doesn't want them.  The administration at Oakvale High attempts to be more welcoming of the \"differently biotic.\" But the students don't want to take classes or eat in the cafeteria next to someone who isn't breathing. And there are no laws that exist to protect the \"living impaired\" from the people who want them to disappear-for good.  When Phoebe falls for Tommy Williams, the leader of the dead kids, no one can believe it; not her best friend, Margi, and especially not her neighbor, Adam, the star of the football team. Adam has feelings for Phoebe that run much deeper than just friendship; he would do anything for her. But what if protecting Tommy is the one thing that would make her happy?", "title": "Generation Dead\n      \n          (Generation Dead #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4872348-generation-dead", "average": 3.6, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1360573012l/4872348.jpg", "reviews": 1169, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/93220.Daniel_Waters", "name": "Daniel Waters"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Horror", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4872348-generation-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3157877-generation-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4872347-generation-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8476360-generaci-n-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6750738-kiss-of-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7031827-passing-strange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13455504-break-my-heart-1-000-times", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13063786-generation-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11346003-dead-kiss"]}
