It has a smell to it, that word---musky and oppressive, like dead flowers in a vase. Sometimes at night I whisper it over to myself: Murderess, Murderess. It rustles, like a taffeta skirt across the floor.\u201d\nSketches made of Grace Marks and James McDermott during their sensationalized trial.Grace Marks, at the age of 16 in 1843, was arrested along with James McDermott for the murders of their employer, Thomas Kinnear, and his mistress/housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery. The murders were rather sensationalized in Canadian society, what with the cold blooded brutality and the fact that a young, rather beautiful, young woman was involved. McDermott was sentenced to hang, while Marks was saved from the gallows by the spirited defence of her lawyer. She spent the next thirty years of her life incarcerated, first in an asylum and then in a prison. This story really picked up several years later when Doctor Simon Jordan decided to make a study of her and hoped to unlock some of her missing memories. See, there were key elements that she didn\u2019t remember about that day that would help him to determine if she was truly a murderess or merely an unwilling accomplice. Jordan was struck by her from the very first moment he met her. \u201dHer eyes were unusually large, it was true, but they were far from insane. Instead they were frankly assessing him. It was as if she were contemplating the subject of some unexplained experiment; as if it were he, and not she, who was under scrutiny.\u201dAnd then there was this observation of Grace by Jordan, as well:\u201dShe\u2019s thinner now, less full in the face; and whereas the picture shows a pretty woman, she is now more than pretty. Or other than pretty. The line of her cheek has a marble, a classic, simplicity; to look at her is to believe that suffering does indeed purify.\u201d\n\u201cOther than pretty\u201d implied further depths to her beyond just the surface beauty that captured the imagination of a ghoulish public. He might not know it, but he was already smitten with Grace and in danger of tumbling head over heels in love with her. It is hard to keep control of a series of interviews if you have become interested in more than just the deeds of the individual. As an added distraction every mother in Toronto with a daughter was trying to manufacture ways to throw their pretty daughters in front of this very eligible bachelor. He was a doctor after all.\u201dAs one season\u2019s crop of girls proceeds into engagement and marriage, younger ones keep sprouting up, like tulips in May. They are now so young in relation to Simon that he has trouble conversing with them; it\u2019s like talking to a basketful of kittens.\u201dThey were fresh, so new they were barely out of the packaging of their youth, and of course virginal. What every man should desire,...right? Well, if one doesn\u2019t mind vacuousness.As fascinating as Grace\u2019s story is, I found myself becoming even more engrossed with the story of Dr. Simon Jordan and his desire driven demons. His landlady, whose husband had absconded on a bout of debauchery, was also proving to be a damsel in distress as her only source of income became her one lodger. \u201dHer face is heart-shaped, her skin milky, her eyes large and compelling; but although her waist is slender, there is something metallic about it, as if she is using a short length of stove-pipe instead of stays. Today she wears her habitual expression of strained anxiety; she smells of violets, and also of camphor.\u201dShe was a beauty past her prime, but still she was compellingly sexy. He felt this attraction against his will. There was no hope for a relationship. She was married and too old to ever be acceptable to his family or his class. He was supposed to marry one of those inane, young ladies. \u201dIt would be one way of deciding his fate, or settling his own hash; or getting himself out of harm\u2019s way. But he won\u2019t do it; he\u2019s not that lazy, or weary; not yet.\u201d I can\u2019t help, but think of Newland Archer from The Age of Innocence, who allowed himself to be trapped into what was expected of him, as well. What if Archer had escaped with Countess Olenska?I still pine for him to escape.So even though the landlady was forbidden, bruised fruit, he couldn\u2019t help, but notice that...\u201cHer lips are full, but fragile, like a rose on the verge of collapse.\u201dThis was one of the many times when I had to read a Margaret Atwood line many times, rolled it around the surface of my tongue, so that I could taste the sweet, the bitter, and the savory of that beautifully written line. Dr. Jordan was starting to have odd thoughts and unsettling dreams of murders committed by himself. He started digging in the garden under the pretense of planting a garden, but it seemed, even to his subconscious self, that he was loosening the soil for...the corpse of his landlord if he should return or maybe a stack of bodies of those from which he wished to escape. It would put him on an equal footing with one particular woman. \u201dMurderess, murderess,  he whispers to himself. It has an allure, a scent almost. Hothouse gardenias. Lurid, but also furtive. He imagines himself breathing it as he draws Grace toward him, pressing his mouth against her. Murderess. He applies it to her throat like a brand.\u201dThis novel is based on the true story of Grace Marks. History lost track of her once she was released from prison after nearly thirty years of incarceration. No tombstone is known to mark her grave. She simply vanished into the woodwork of a new America. Atwood has not only brought her to life, but has seamlessly and creatively put words of putty and glue into the missing pieces. I wonder every time I finish an Atwood why I don\u2019t read her more frequently. \nSarah Gadon plays Grace Marks in the seriesNetflix has recently launched the first season of a new show based on Alias Grace. It spurred me to get this book read that I had planned to read three years ago. I was wooed by other more pressing books, and what a fool I was. I don\u2019t know how I feel about watching the series. I\u2019m as sure that it is good as I am sure that it will disappoint. I will eventually work up the courage to watch it, but I think I will luxuriate in reverence for the book for a while.

It rustles, like a taffeta skirt along the floor... Highlight of 2017 for me!A pure gem. That is Alias Grace, for me. Another grand work of Margaret Atwood. Atwood, described as \u2018one of the most brilliant and unpredictable novelists alive\u2019 (Literary Review)\u2026\u2026and also: \u2018A witty, elegant, generous and patient writer.\u2019 I would say a strong-minded, self-willed, wayward writer, sometimes also dark and ruthless. This story keeps you hooked from beginning to end, following Grace Marks in her troubled life. A colourful, multifaceted and intriguing story, that keeps you reading for more than 500 pages\u2026. This is how Atwood describes the story outline in her Author\u2019s Afterword, which I recommend everyone to read in full: About Grace is a work of fiction, although it is based on reality. Its central figure, Grace Marks, was one of the most notorious Canadian women of the 1840s, having been convicted of murder at the age of sixteen. The Kinnear-Montgomery murders took place on July 23, 1843, and were extensively reported not only in Canadian newspapers but in those of the United States and Britain. The details were sensational: Grace Marks was uncommonly pretty and also extremely young. Nancy Montgomery had previously given birth to an illegitimate child and was Thomas Kinnear\u2019s mistress; at her autopsy she was found to be pregnant. Grace and her fellow servant James McDermott had run away to the US together and were assumed by the press to be lovers\u2026..The trial was held in early November. Only the Kinnear murder was tried. \u2026. McDermott was hanged in front of a huge crowd on November 21, but opinion about Grace was divided from the start and due to the efforts of her lawyer and a group of respectable gentlemen petitioners \u2013who pleaded her youth, the weakness of her sex and her supposed witlessness her sentence was commuted to life\u2026. She continued to be written about over the course of the century, and she continued to polarize opinion. Attitudes towards her reflected contemporary ambiguity about the nature of women: was Grace a female fiend and temptress, the instigator of the crime and the real murderer of Nancy Montgomory, or was she an unwilling victim, forced to keep silent by McDermott\u2019s threats and by fear of her own life? \u2026.So this story takes you in more than 500 pages in a quiet pace through the life of Grace\u2026 and a variety of characters surround her in the progress of the story. Including the fascinating Dr. Jordan, who comes into play to assess Grace and in that process we witness his struggle and moral decline\u2026.As Atwood says in her afterword: she stayed with the historical facts, but there were gaps there or unclarities/various versions and in that case she took the liberty to fill those gaps in. What can I say. I think Atwood is a true artist \u2013 solid writing \u2013 sharp observations \u2013 great writing. What more can I want? 5 stars and highly recommended. I'm a fan (was already, now it's official :-))"}, {"userName": "Kalliope", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope", "userReview": "Working with patches. Patchwork. Putting together various pieces of material that already existed and joining them into a new design.This is the theme that Margaret Atwood has developed through her novel, and I am not making this up for the sake of my review. Her concluding paragraphs, spoken by her heroine, are about the patched Tree of Paradise.\nThe Tree itself is of triangles, in two colours, dark for the leaves and a lighter colour for the fruits; I am using purple for the leaves and red for the fruits.\nAnd so Atwood constructed her fiction. She has taken fragments from a past reality, from a crime committed in the Canada of the 1840s. The unifying thread is the fictionalized account of Grace Marks, one of the two people convicted for a double murder. The other person accused was hanged, but her sentence was commuted to life in prison. Through her novel Atwood has called her to live again--in fiction. Thanks to her stitches.Using this textual thread, one spun out of the materials of memory and invention, Atwood has joined many other pieces. Some add colour and veracity, for she includes fragments from newspapers \u2013 for as this became a famous case, a plethora of texts narrated this event before Atwood did \u2013 as well as extracts from the written confessions by Marks herself, or from letters written by real life figures such as the Medical Superintendent of the Asylum where Marks was interned, or from the Diary of the Warden of the Penitentiary where Marks spent the early part of her sentence. Other fragments included add a different tonality and ingenuity. Stanzas from poems, sonnets, stanzas and tragedies interspersed here and there add insight and sensitivity. This crafty use of lyrical and dramatic elements appeal to our fancies and sharpen our awareness, and the overall effect is new and compelling.And as we notice Atwood\u2019s abilities in working with patches, we recognized her literary artistry and her understanding of the powers of fiction. When stories are woven they are nothing at all, but when they are finished, with all their parts sewn together, they become what they are. Not surprisingly is Scheherezade invoked in the novel. For stories, mixing truths and falsities acquire the nature of something else. They are not too different from the Tree of Paradise, the tree of Life and of Good&Evil."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1118970-jamie", "userReview": "Margaret Atwood occupies a strange nook in my heart. She's become a bit of a chore lately, as I'm including her in my senior honors thesis; on the other hand, I've now read almost all of her novels, and while none are bad or even...not really good. Just that because a few of the novels shine so brightly, that the others seem duller in comparison.Well, Alias Grace is a supernova. It's an absolutely phenomenal novel, and a truly thrilling read. It's a departure for Atwood, as it's historical fiction (of course, she did do the Journals of Susanna Moodie before), but moreover, it employs similar narrative techniques as detective fiction, while turning them on their head--in any case, it's definitely a page-turner, which is not something you usually mention in conjunction with Atwood. This doesn't discount the literary merit--there's enough meat in the book to write a dissertation or five on it. There's something quite fresh in her style here, with many many passages I absolutely had to read aloud to whomever was (un)fortunate enough to be near me as I read.The general structure of the novel is from the outset quite fascinating--each section is tied under the flag of a quilt pattern, and each begins with a series of epigraphs, combining historical documents, poetry, \"witness accounts\" and so forth--ultimately questioning the validity of each, and how we reconfigure the past with necessarily limited frameworks at hand. Writing a fictionalized account of a historical person is itself an indictment of history, but Atwood takes it so much farther, and in much more wonderfully 'political' ways. Grace is still a frustrating enigma by the end of the text, but you'll adore her and her sly moves, her secret longings, and her storytelling ability--Dr. Jordan, as we discover, has no idea what he's getting into with her. It's certainly a dark read, and often I would have to lay the book down for at least a minute or two to catch my breath. But Atwood has a wonderful way of infusing humor into even the bleakest of moments, so there were just as many times when I found myself laughing aloud. This book will not leave you for a long time."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "I keep kicking myself for having ditched the Atwood Speaking Gala at A.W.P. in Chicago this year. The fierce literati kept the attendance so high that it was virtually as if Lady Gaga herself were to give a lecture on her impressive work. I was more interested in walking all around Chitown, anyway, but I really (semi)regret not having nabbed a coveted seat. She was probably amazing: uberclever & brilliant.Without two minor (teeny) infractions, \u201cAlias Grace\u201d is pretty much a well-rounded, totalizing, COMPLETE novel\u2014one which paints a full world with such realistic colors that the reader quickly forgets that the plot actually comes from the 1850\u2019s Annals of Canadian Crime. Before I start extolling it madly, let me quickly state what those two \u201cminor infractions\u201d are: Grace\u2019s first-person accounts are not completely authentic-sounding; they are far too articulate and intelligent\u2014symbols become too clearly presented to the reader (who should feel slightly MORE confused, as psyches are often deep chasms) as the author\u2019s own signature is made overly-clear in Grace\u2019s own declarations (Atwood adds on her character\u2019s openly-questionable credibility pretty early on, to her credit). Also, there is this feeling that without that added spice of changing POV\u2019s and tenses, the plot would have been banal & tedious\u2014the middle indeed sags, but the conclusion, the last 80 pages of it, is ultimately positively stellar. Luckily for us, the writer was hyperaware of how much of her own added element would befit this seemingly-simple story of homicide. Those symbols of femininity (the red peonies, the patchwork quilt, the washing and scrap-booking) have never been placed in such intense context before\u2014I was genuinely enthralled, impressed like a rabid Atwood fanboy. I truly like this one, perhaps not as much as her fantastic \u201cOryx and Crake,\u201d but far more than her most famous \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d & her more recent \u201cYear of the Flood.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "I felt about Alias Grace the same way I did about probably half of Atwood's novels I've read so far - I just didn't fully get it. Nobody conveys Life ain't easy for a woman message as well as Atwood. Past, present, future - the living is rough for women. It is particularly unpleasant for Grace Marks, a young servant girl in mid-19th century Canada, accused of murdering her employer and his housekeeper with the help of her co-worker and alleged paramour, and who is locked up first in an insane asylum and then prison. Atwood finds a way to explore plenty of issues from a feminist standpoint here - poverty, servitude, sexual repression, violence, insanity - and does is marvelously.What didn't work for me was Grace's story itself. Evidently, this real-life criminal case got a lot of attention back in a day. Was Grace a cunning murderess? Or did her supposed lover force her to participate in this gruesome crime? Did she make up her convenient memory loss? People speculated about this 150 years ago without coming to any definitive conclusion. Atwood doesn't give any answers in her fictionalized version either. After establishing Grace's character so well, the author failed in my eyes to come up with a convincing solution to the mystery, or a believable motivation for either scenario. If Grace was in fact the evil murderess, why did she desire to kill her master? And if her co-conspirator was in charge, what was his reason? I never understood this.I appreciate ambiguity on fiction, but what is the point of reconstructing a crime, examining it if you do not give any opinion as to what actually took place?

It may indicate something essentially unknowable, ineffable - the lacuna in the Old Testament is when God tells Moses I AM THAT I AM, which lets us know in no uncertain terms that this thing is not of logic or language, whatever it may be; the lacuna of the New Testament is Christ's three days in the tomb - we are not told anything about that, it is unknowable. Or this gap in the story may indicate simply something someone does not wish to tell us - the very heart of the matter, the thing of shame, the motive. Here the gap is a void or avoidance. Psychologically powerful avoidance fuelled by intense guilt makes a hair-raising narrative, as the reader, writer and protagonist gradually converge together and find themselves in the belly of the beast - two memorable examples from non-fiction are Fritz Stangl's horrible wrestling with his past as commandant of Treblinka in Gitta Sereney's series of interviews with him (\"Into that Darkness\") and Michaud & Aynesbury's interviews with Ted Bundy (\"Conversations with a Killer\"). In both cases we are caught up in the subtle and confrontational stratagems the interviewers use to get the monster to acknowledge an identification with the previous self who committed the atrocities. Stangl ferociously hangs on to the \"it was just a job, a really really difficult job\" line until he cracks - and how dramatic to read that a day or so after he finally - finally - admits that he was personally responsible for what he had done, he dies of a heart attack. Bundy constructs a way of describing his crimes by \"speculating\" about them in the third person, contemplating how the person who perpetrated them \"might have been\" feeling, of how he \"was reacting inappropriately to stress in his life\". He edges to the very rim of acceptance of guilt but can't manage the swan-dive into what we non-serial killers assume to be the cleansing waters of catharsis which await those who accept their crimes and seek atonement.  Alias Grace's story likewise is a stately sarabande of 550 pages around the central question - did she do it? Suspended from that mystery, the ponderous but pillowy narrative describes the life of Grace Marks in her own languid hyper-observational manner (a great fictional voice) and counterposes this with the fervid cavortings of the brain doctor sent to ferret out her great secret. He's quite a scream.  So anyway, this book is squarely in that genre I call Modern Victorian, in which the contemporary novelist writes us another great big Victorian story but being modern can put in all the filth and flesh, all the naming of parts which the real Victorian novelists couldn't do. It turns out, from what I've read so far, to be a great idea. Consider these -1) The Crimson Petal and the White (Michel Faber) - completely brilliant and nearly 1000 pages too2) The Quincunx (Charles Palliser) - completely brilliant and just over 1000 pages3) Fingersmith (Sarah Waters) - yes, just about completely brilliant too4) The French Lieutenant's Woman (John Fowles) - acknowledged by all to be fairly brilliantVery glad to add Alias Grace to this select list and will be happy to grab up other Modern Victorians as they swim my way. Alias Grace likes, in its modern way, to leave a lot of stuff unanswered and without chucking in a huge horrid spoiler here, I can't reveal why I think that part of the Central Revelatory Scene was pure codswallop, but that didn't make no never mind.

A work of fiction, but based on actual historical events, Alias Grace is the story of the convicted murderess, Grace Marks. Sixteen year old Grace and fellow servant James McDermott are said to have brutally murdered their employer, Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper and supposed mistress, Nancy Montgomery, in Canada during the 1840\u2019s. However, Grace claimed to have no memory of her own culpability in these murders. Both were found guilty; James McDermott was condemned to death and Grace Marks was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Provincial Penitentiary in Kingston, Canada.In the novel, Grace\u2019s story is revealed to Dr. Simon Jordan, a fictional, progressive, young doctor who is trained in the study of mental illnesses. Dr. Jordan\u2019s expertise has been requested by a group of individuals who are petitioning for a pardon for Grace. Grace\u2019s story, as she relates it in the first person to Dr. Jordan, is so very compelling, I could not put this book down. I was immediately drawn to Grace as she so expressively recounted her memories of her childhood, her migration to Canada from Ireland, her new life as a servant, her trial and her life in prison. Just like Dr. Jordan, I at first wondered about her guilt, her sanity, and whether or not she was speaking with candor or artifice. The prose here is so wonderfully moving. At the end of one of her sessions with Dr. Jordan, Grace says, either to the reader or to herself:\u201cWhile he writes, I feel as if he is drawing me; or not drawing me, drawing on me \u2013 drawing on my skin \u2013 not with the pencil he is using, but with an old-fashioned goose pen, and not with the quill end but with the feather end. As if hundreds of butterflies have settled all over my face, and are softly opening and closing their wings.\u201d\u201cBut underneath that is another feeling, a feeling of being wide-eyed awake and watchful. It\u2019s like being wakened suddenly in the middle of the night, by a hand over your face, and you sit up with your heart going fast, and no one is there. And underneath that is another feeling still, a feeling like being torn open; not like a body of flesh, it is not painful as such, but like a peach; and not even torn open, but too ripe and splitting open of its own accord. And inside the peach there\u2019s a stone.\u201dGrace also has a way of discerning others that is at times both shrewd and witty. I felt as if she could easily have switched roles with Dr. Jordan \u2013 she being the analyst and he being the subject of her scrutiny rather than vice versa. And, Dr. Jordan, I felt was verily in need of some rehabilitation of his own psyche! In addition, I found even her general observations of her surroundings to be rather droll. I found myself laughing out loud on occasion. In her description of a bustle, she says \u201cit was like having another bum tied on top of your real one and the two of them following you around like a tin bucket tied to a pig.\u201d Grace\u2019s narrations of her dreams, too, were so vivid; I could feel the stirring emotions these evoked. \u201cI was seeing it all for the first time, although I also knew I had been there before, as is the way in dreams\u2026 And I longed to be there, although in the dream I was there already; but I had a great yearning towards this house, for it was my real home.\u201dI grew to admire Grace throughout this book. But, was she innocent or guilty of the heinous crime for which she was convicted? Are we, the readers, able to come to a conclusion based on Ms. Atwood\u2019s spin on this factual event? Or, is that not the real purpose here \u2013 to come to a veritable conclusion?

This includes Grace\u2019s childhood in Ireland, her subsequent traumatic emigration to Canada and a life in service prior to events concerning the murders and her eventual incarceration. Atwood paints as usual a fascinating picture, which is not only compelling but has an all pervading air of authenticity throughout. Interesting too is the developing (imagined) relationship between Jordan and Marks and the effect that their interviews together have on each other. Dr Jordan is an aspiring and ambitious scientist \u2013 and due to the time in which the story takes place, this is a world of proto psychology, embryonic psychiatry \u2013 both very much in their infancy. It is also the parallel world of s\u00e9ances, possession, mesmerism, exorcism, and neuro-hypnotism \u2013 the difference between the two worlds often indistinct.A major theme running throughout the novel is the treatment, subjugation, demonisation and conversely the romanticisation of women associated with or accused of violent crime; particularly by comparison to their male counterparts. This is all about class, gender, age, sex and power and Margaret Atwood shines a light on the many issues central to a story such as this one and in doing so, deconstructs the assumptions/presumptions seemingly held about Grace Marks at that time \u2013 and by extension about so many cases since that time, has anything actually changed?This is a dark, gloomy and murky world where fact blurs with fiction, guilt with innocence, sanity with madness, love with desire, memory with imagination, truth with auto-suggestion, victim with perpetrator, science with superstition, good with evil, life with death\u2026Atwood also provides us with a useful afterword, in which she outlines the \u2018known facts\u2019 (such as they are) concerning Grace Marks and the Kinnear/Montgomery murders. Atwood reiterates that \u2018Alias Grace\u2019 is although having its roots in fact, is overwhelmingly a work of fiction. \u2018Alias Grace\u2019 is a great novel, brilliantly written \u2013 highly recommended and not to be missed."}, {"userName": "Shovelmonkey1", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3926982-shovelmonkey1", "userReview": "The Handmaid's Tale and the Blind Assassin were my previous Atwood reads and while I understand her alpha-author status in Canada and international reputation, her works just do not quite blow my mind enough to turn me into an obsessive Atwood completist. Before I decided to read Alias Grace it had been on my shelf for three years gathered enough dust to sculpt a dust bunny the size of an actual rabbit. I feel the same about A.S Byatt... no reason, no discernible malaise directed at these two lauded lady writers although while I'm on the subject of lady writers, did you know that A.S Byatt is Margaret Drabbles sister?! Ah the powers of google, feeding extra computer facts into my non-computer brain.The Alias Grace in question is Grace Marks. Reputed murderess of the 1840s, this Canadian killer was a cause celebre for a number of years. Murderous Georgian ladies were uncommon so got a lot of press. Grace got a lot of press because she was young and pretty too, thus leaving a lot of the puritanical religious minded community to pause for thought when it came to considering what the perceived face of evil might really look like. Grace Marks and her alleged paramour, stable hand James McDermott were charged with the murder of their employer Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper/lover Nancy Montgomery after which they fled to the United States while dressed in the garb of the murder victims. Nothing says crazy like playing dress-up in corpse clothes.In the true tradition of all the best murder mysteries, there were a lot of question marks over whodunnit or to be more precise, who exactly did what to who and when. The trial was well documented and although McDermott was hanged for his crime, Grace escaped the noose and went on to live alternately in a penitentiary and a lunatic asylum depending on her state of mind at any given time.Atwood subtly adapts this tale of murder most horrid by giving a voice to Grace Marks and allowing her to tell her story. Atwood freely admits that where there were uncertainties or blanks in the historic record, she gave her imagination free reign, but she could not stretch the truth too far or the story would not seem remotely credible. The historic jury is still out on whether or not Grace committed the crimes, either knowingly, unknowingly in a state delerium tremens (or some other mysterious lady-condition identified as nerves or a delicate constitution back in the bad old days) or not at all. The addition of quack-esque doctor Simon Jordan is also an excellent touch as his moral and mental decline throughout the tale stands in stark contrast to Grace's seemingly robust and sanguine nature."}, {"userName": "Gorkem Y", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5811468-gorkem-y", "userReview": "Virtu\u00f6z AtwoodBir kez daha \u015funu anlad\u0131m ki Atwood, yaz\u0131m dili, zekas\u0131, karakterlerinin i\u00e7 d\u00fcnyas\u0131n\u0131 aktar\u0131m\u0131, olaylar\u0131 \u00e7ok katmanl\u0131l\u0131\u011f\u0131 \u015fekilde b\u00f6lebilme yetene\u011fi, sizi karakterin beynine y\u00f6nlendirebilmesi ve kendi zekas\u0131n\u0131 yazd\u0131\u011f\u0131 her diyalog i\u00e7inde kararl\u0131 \u015fekilde devam ettirebilmesi..vs a\u00e7\u0131s\u0131ndan g\u00fcn\u00fcm\u00fczdeki en etkili kad\u0131n yazarlar\u0131ndan birisi.

Most of the story comes in from two perspectives, Grace Marks herself telling her story to a young MD/psychologist working to see if he can get her released from prison, and then from the young physician himself listening to her story, never sure he can truly trust her, yet physically drawn to her, in the meantime having his own weird personal life that mirrors some of the things Grace herself has gone through.The author's writing is so beautiful, so perfect for the era (mid 1800's) full of metaphors of the colors red, blue and white, the icy burial of Grace's mother at sea. There is attention to every little detail of the times, the smells, clothing, difficult working conditions of the servants and maids, the religious attitudes of the time, the early science of psychology, the conditions in the prisons, insane asylums, the gossip, the power of men, the sad position of some of the women, the life of the entitled and affluent versus the life of the unentitled, our little Grace, who has done an amazing job of surviving the dozens of trials of her life. In the end, it doesn't really matter how involved she was or wasn't in the murders. What matters is that her spirit was never broken and she made it through extreme conditions with the help of some great people and she did it with Grace. I love Grace. Throughout the book I was most happy that we now have air conditioning. I always laughed when Grace talked about certain people doing or saying \"coarse\" things. The relationship our little do good physician had with his landlady was hilarious and sad at the same time. Oh how we have mixed emotions and impulses as humans.

Grace was just 16 in the year 1843 when she was accused of murdering her employer, Thomas Kinnear, along with his mistress and housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery. Grace's regal beauty and tender age redeemed her to the masses and a score of individuals pleaded for her freedom. Grace had little to say for herself, claiming short-term amnesia for the time surrounding the murder. James McDermott was also convicted but, unlike Grace, had no individuals fighting for him, apart from their shared lawyer, and swung for his misdemeanours. Just before he took his final breaths he announced to the crowd that Grace was responsible for Nancy's murder. Instead of following his fate, Grace was incarcerated in an asylum. Whether she was guilty or innocent has never been proven and Grace herself remained reluctant to redeem or condemn herself, continuing to claim a lapse in memory until her eventual death.This fictional account follows Grace's story some years after the chilling ordeal. She is now only temporarily incarcerated at night and spends her days working as a maid in a grand household. Doctor Simon Jordan visits her new abode and, eager to uncover the secrets of this infamous case, sets up a series of meetings in which to explore the past by increasingly peculiar means.Uncovering the mysteries of the past had me as enthralled and captivated as Dr Jordan. Learning the details of this case, through Grace's own words (albeit fictionally), was exhilarating. I appreciated how Atwood provided autonomy to the silenced, historical female and allowed her a space in which to voice her own story.The intrigue continued far beyond the reaches of the page, as Grace's fictional story terminates as mysteriously as her real-world duplicate's. The reader is invited to provide their own closure as no sufficient one is granted, by both Atwood and by history. And so, Grace Marks continues to haunt and to capture the imagination."}, {"userName": "BrokenTune", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune", "userReview": "\"Sometimes at night I whisper it over to myself: Murderess, Murderess. It rustles, like a taffeta skirt across the floor.Murderer is merely brutal. It\u2019s like a hammer, or a lump of metal. I would rather be a murderess than a murderer, if those are the only choices.\"Alias Grace is Margaret Atwood's record of Grace Marks, who convicted of murder, spent thirty years in prison and a mental institution before being pardoned.The book is based on true events of one of Ontario's most ambiguous cases - there was a confession but there was also an episode of amnesia - or was there? \"You won\u2019t believe me, Sir, I say. Anyway it\u2019s all been decided, the trial is long over and done with and what I say will not change anything. You should ask the lawyers and the judges, and the newspaper men, they seem to know my story better than I do myself.\"Atwood pieces together the records about Grace Marks in this book, paying much attention to the details of characters, conditions, and to the analysis of contradictions in those various records. As a result Alias Grace is not just a biography of Grace Marks but more poignantly a record of women's lives in mid-nineteenth century Ontario.It's a harsh read, full of tragedy and hardship, of misogyny, of ignorance, violence, hypocrisy.Grace, whilst incarcerated, spends periods of time in the mental hospital associated with the prison - and we never find out whether there was a need for her to be there or whether she sought a reprieve from prison conditions. \"They wouldn\u2019t know mad when they saw it in any case, because a good portion of the women in the Asylum were no madder than the Queen of England. Many were sane enough when sober, as their madness came out of a bottle, which is a kind I knew very well. One of them was in there to get away from her husband, who beat her black and blue, he was the mad one but nobody would lock him up; and another said she went mad in the autumns, as she had no house and it was warm in the Asylum, and if she didn\u2019t do a fair job of running mad she would freeze to death; but then in the spring she would become sane again because it was good weather and she could go off and tramp in the woods and fish, and as she was part Red Indian she was handy at such things. I would like to do that myself if I knew how, and if not afraid of the bears.\"Considering that the treatment of mental illness at the time was nothing short of barbaric, the indication that people would voluntarily submit to the asylum was one of the most evocative illustrations of the conditions endured by the women described in the book. When reading the book, I was reminded of The Handmaids Tale. It occurred to me that this was simply a re-working of the biography of Grace Marks from the same perspective that focused on the unfair and unequal treatment of women in The Handmaids Tale. I am hesitant to use the term \"feminist\" here as I don't want to taint the term with, I guess, my own criticism of the perspective used by Atwood in Alias Grace. What was lacking for me in this novel was the presence of any decent men in Grace's story prior to her incarceration. This notable absence, even more so the portrayal of men in a bad light throughout almost the entire book, made it difficult to trust the credibility of the descriptions - as otherwise this would have been a 5* read.\"...the real curse of Eve was having to put up with the nonsense of Adam, who as soon as there was any trouble, blamed it all on her.\"What I did enjoy about the book, tho, was that it did not seek to provide answers or morals. After all, Grace's story is set in an almost amoral environment where wisdom is not gained by learning or status but only by living.  \"The pattern of this quilt is called the Tree of Paradise, and whoever named that pattern said better than she knew, as the Bible does not say Trees. It says there were two different trees, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge; but I believe there was only the one, and that the Fruit of Life and the Fruit of Good and Evil were the same. And if you ate of it you would die, but if you didn\u2019t eat of it you would die also; although if you did eat of it, you would be less bone-ignorant by the time you got around to your death.\""}, {"userName": "Maxine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5208303-maxine", "userReview": "Alias Grace, although a work of fiction, is based on one of Canada's most infamous murder cases. In Toronto, in 1843 16-year-old Grace Marks and fellow servant, James McDermott were accused of murdering their employer, Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper and mistress, Nancy Montgomery. Both were sentenced to death and McDermott was hanged. However, Grace's lawyer was able to get her sentence commuted to life imprisonment by arguing her youth, her gender, and, according to him, her feeble-mindedness.The story opens when Grace has been in Kingston Penitentiary for 15 years. This is a period of reform in Canada and a group of clergy and others hire Dr Simon Jordan, a young American psychiatrist, to establish her innocence as Grace claims to have no memory of the actual murders. The story is told from different perspectives. Each chapter begins with an actual quote from the period, including excerpts from the trial, her and James' confessions, newspaper articles, and from Susanna Moodie, an early Canadian writer who went to see Grace, both at the penitentiary and, in the insane asylum, where she spent five years. The story is also told by Grace in the first person while Jordan's part of the story is told in the third.Each chapter is also named after a quilt pattern with a corresponding picture of the pattern and each pattern gives us a hint of what to expect in the chapter. Throughout the story, Grace talks about quilt patterns and she is often pictured piecing a quilt together while telling her story. Grace, frequently, points out that quilts appear differently when seen from different angles and, like the quilts, Grace's story is pieced together from fragments, not all of which seem to fit together. Atwood never establishes the guilt or innocence of Grace. Instead, she leaves it up to the reader to decide whether Grace is the innocent she seems to portray herself or the murdering temptress others have named her. As Grace tells her story, she often admits to the reader, but not to Jordan, that she is telling him what she thinks he wants to hear, so that we are never sure whether to believe any or all of what she says. But this story isn't really about whether Grace is innocent or guilty although guilt plays an important role in the story. It is about class, and status, and about the role of women in Victorian Canada at a time when women, regardless of class, were seen as the weaker sex, feeble of mind and body, always at the mercy of men who invariably seem to betray them. According to Grace, poor women have only three avenues open to them, service in a wealthy household, marriage, or prostitution.Alias grace is a fascinating look at Canada West (Ontario) in Victorian times; it is also an intriguing psychological thriller as well as a brilliant feminist novel. Margaret Atwood is often considered Canada's greatest living writer. It is easy to see why when you read Alias Grace."}, {"userName": "Wilja", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40211206-wilja", "userReview": "Jane Eyre meets Runa.

I have to say, I never really know what I am getting into with an Atwood novel: she always goes somewhere unexpected, thought-provoking and cleverly multi-layered.Grace Marks was accused - along with stable-hand James McDermott - of murdering her employer and his house-keeper, but her death sentence was commuted to a lifetime imprisonment. Every official version of her story seem to contradict each other and while some people are convinced of her guilt, a rather large group of people insist that she is innocent and wrongly incarcerated. Enter young and rather pompous Dr. Simon Jordan, who is trying to establish an early form of psychology as an accepted science and not charlatanism: since Grace's sanity has been in question since she was arrested while trying to run away with her accomplice, Dr. Jordan wants to try his methods on her to find out whether or not she is sane, and consequently find out whether or not she is guilty of murder.The story is build around these interviews between Grace and the doctor, but also around the historical documentation about Grace Marks: her guilt was never firmly established and her true story remains very mysterious, giving Atwood a great opportunity to speculate on what might have happened.Atwood's characters are always complicated creations. Grace is a strange blend of innocent and proper, while also being too well-aware of the grittier realities of life. But like a true lady, she works hard to keep on the right side of the line of propriety, even after being incarcerated and committed to a lunatics' asylum. Is she a very talented actress, simple-minded or an intelligent woman living in a day and age where being clever is a dangerous quality?Simon Jordan is unbearably snobby and immature: he is one of those learned-men who thinks he is the only one who understands how the world works and who knows better than everybody else. Ironically, while he claims to understand a great deal about the human mind, he doesn't know himself or understand why he does what he does half the time. I greatly enjoyed laughing at him, even if he was often more perceptive of the hypocrisies and double-standards Grace and other women had to deal with.Which leads me to what I found the most fascinating about this novel. It won't surprise anyone to know that women got the short end of the stick in the 1840's, but Atwood takes a subtle path to discuss the inequality issues: Grace is aware that the deck has been stacked against her all her life because she is poor (and a girl), and she is determined to make the best of it, but through her eyes, we see what happens to other women who dare to \"misbehave\". Mary Whitney's death as a direct result of her so-called transgression (even if without a man's intervention and manipulation, she would have lived), the ridiculous landlady's desires, which can only be expressed if she plays the role of the victim, the shunning endured by Nancy for her lifestyle. Simon's views are progressive for the time. For example, he is aware that it is material need that drives poor women to prostitution, and not a taste for vice. In fact, repressed sexuality is all over this book, which doesn't come as a surprise given the setting, but it is used quite skillfully to demonstrate the various hypocrisies and loopholes of the moral code that people are supposed to adhere to in a puritan society where the realities of having a human body are \"distasteful\".What bothered me about \"Alias Grace\" is that Atwood's attempt to inject a little touch of the supernatural in the story felt strained. Grace is remarkable as a narrator, because she is utterly unreliable and mercurial, and there can be many reasons as to why she would lie or pretend to have forgotten some events. There's no one left alive who can corroborate or disclaim anything she says, and women knew that it was better to pretend to be insane and at the very least have a safe enough place to sleep than to be completely sane and destitute. Is she playing a game with the doctor, the matrons and the guards, is she genuinely nuts? Up until the last page, it's impossible to tell. But the hint that something paranormal is going on felt excessive: there's enough weirdness going on with Grace without adding this cherry on the sundae. Did Jeremiah coach her into her little \"performance\" or was it genuine? Honestly, who cares?! It just feels unnecessary.A solid 4 stars.

Usually, I hate giving away the endings of books in my reviews, but I honestly cannot talk about Alias Grace without giving away major plot points. You've been warned. So: for the most part, this was a cool story, mostly because it's based on the true story of Grace Marks, who supposedly helped murder her employer and his housekeeper. She served thirty years in prison, plus several years in a mental institution. Atwood's story has two perspectives: Grace Marks and Simon Jordan, a doctor who's interviewing her and basically trying to get her to remember the day of the murders. This was all pretty cool, and I liked Grace a lot as a protagonist. So let's move on to the negative. Stuff I Didn't Like:-Simon creeped me out. One minute he's half-heartedly flirting with the daughter of the prison Govenor while mentally undressing her, and then he's screwing his landlady for reasons that even he doesn't understand. And then towards the end of the book he's suddenly like, \"Oh wait! I'm in love with Grace! Yes! Totally in love\" and it made NO SENSE. This was the first time I'd read a book where Atwood writes from a man's perspective, and it did not go well. -I guessed the ending. This is an extremely bad sign, because I can NEVER guess book endings, ever. But with this book, I'd gotten to the part where Grace describes how McDermott told her she'd promised to sleep with him, and she was like, \"I did not\" and I thought, \"She's being possessed by the spirit of Mary Whitney.\" And then I thought that it had to be more complicated than that, and that there would be a scientific explanation for it. But there wasn't. Which brings me to my next point...-Atwood's half-hearted commitment to the paranormal aspect of the story. The hypnosis scene revealed that Mary was possessing Grace, but then everyone was like, \"But that's not possible, there's a psychological explanation\" but they never gave one. All the elements of a good ghost story are here: the peddlar who reads palms, divination with an apple peel, people making strange, random prophesies (like Grace's mother saying she wouldn't survive the voyage, and Mary telling Grace she'd cross water three times before getting married), and the bizarre possession. But Atwood, probably because she didn't want to lose her credibility or something, refrains from going all-out with the paranormal events. If she'd have relaxed a bit and written the book as a ghost story instead of historic fiction, it would have been really good. -The whole hypnosis. I was sure it was all an act, because Jeremiah had been telling Grace earlier about setting up a fake spiritualist act, but then Grace didn't seem to remember anything about the hypnosis or what she said during it. So could Jeremiah actually hypnotize people? After the hypnosis scene, and as soon as I realized I was expected to believe that it had been authentic, was when my faith in the story really started to drop. It was all downhill from there.-No twist ending. I was waiting, up until the last page, for Grace to be like, \"I'm so glad I killed those two bastards. Mwahahahaha! The end.\" But no such luck. In retrospect, I should have known better - Atwood hates giving readers a straight answer to anything, and conclusive endings where everything gets wrapped up in a neat little package is for lesser authors, I guess."}, {"userName": "Libros Prestados", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36773851-libros-prestados", "userReview": "Una historia que trata sobre la culpabilidad, la memoria (\u00bfpuede alguien sentirse culpable por lo que no recuerda?), las diferencias sociales, el sistema penitenciario (por llamarlo de alguna manera), los conocimientos sobre enfermedades mentales y la posici\u00f3n de la mujer en el siglo XIX.Es como si Margaret Atwood hubiera partido de \"El cuento de la criada\" (la narraci\u00f3n subjetiva de una mujer prisionera sin posibilidad de salir) y hubiera profundizado para contarnos los pormenores de una sociedad, la Canad\u00e1 de mitades/finales del siglo XIX. Es un buen libro hist\u00f3rico, donde se nota el uso y la diversidad de fuentes. Pero sobre todo es una gran novela introspectiva.No quiere tanto aclarar si Grace es culpable o no (no es un libro reivindicativo, como s\u00ed lo es un poco \"Ritos funerales\"), sino que pretende jugar con las posibilidades. Todo el mundo es culpable de algo. Eso no quiere decir que se deba castigar por ley. Todo el mundo, en un momento determinado, puede cometer un delito, eso no quiere decir que sea una mala persona incapaz de redimirse. Lo que a Atwood le interesa analizar es la fina, fin\u00edsima l\u00ednea, que existe entre el pensamiento y la acci\u00f3n, entre tener un comportamiento inadecuado y cometer un delito, entre c\u00f3mo se juzga a una persona u otra seg\u00fan su posici\u00f3n social y/o sexo. Me ha gustado m\u00e1s que \"El cuento de la criada\" porque creo que en \"Alias Grace\" se profundiza m\u00e1s en los personajes (al menos en la protagonista) y la historia est\u00e1 m\u00e1s compenetrada con el tema que pretende abordar.Para m\u00ed ha sido una lectura interesante y absorbente."}, {"userName": "Maciek", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek", "userReview": "Alias Grace, Margaret Atwood's ninth novel is a work of historical fiction, although based on a true historical event - the story of Grace Marks, a Canadian housemaid who was convicted of murdering her employer Thomas Kinnear, and suspected of murdering his housekeeper, Nancy Montgomery on July 23, 1840. The murder has been extensively reported in Canadian, American and British newspapers. It has sparked quite a controversy: Nancy was Kinnear's mistress who has before given birth to an illegitimate child, and at the autopsy she was found to be pregnant again. Grace has immigrated to Canada from Ireland in 1840 when she was 12; her mother has died on the ship carrying the Marks family and was buried at sea, leaving Grace and her younger siblings in care of her father, an abusive alcoholic. She was sentenced for the murders together with James McDermott, one of her fellow servants, as they were caught together during an attempted escape from Canada into the United States; McDermott has been put to death by hanging while Grace has been first sentenced into a confinement in an insane asylum, but later moved to Kingston penitentiary in Ontario, a maximum security prison. She spent almost three decades there before being pardoned; the last information available is that Grace has moved to live in New York. No one knows what became of Grace Marks after that.In the afterwood Atwood points out that while both McDermott and Marks have been condemnded to death for the Kinnear murder, opinions on Grace have been divided from the start; thanks to the efforts of her lawyer and a couple of petitioners her fate has been changed to life imprisonment, from which she has eventually been pardoned. Much ambiguity concerned her case, and opinions on her have been polarized:Attitudes towards her reflected contemporary ambiguity about the nature of women: was Grace a female fiend and temptress, the instigator of the crime and the real murderer of Nancy Montgomery, or was she an unwilling victim, forced to keep silent by McDermott\u2019s threats and by fear for her own life? It was no help that she herself gave three different versions of the Montgomery murder, while James McDermott gave two.The novel is an attempt to explore the ambiguity concerning that murder and the character of Grace Marks, and a very complex and captivating one at that. The novel is told from two perspectives: as a first hand account by Grace, chronicling her life in the penitentiary and remembrances of her past, from her family's arrival in Canada, the struggles and hardships, employment at the Kinnear house and metting with James McDermott.The second narration is in the thirs person, from the perspective of Simon Jordan, a young and ambitious American practictioner of the growing field of psychiatry. As Grace claims to have no memory of the actual murders, he is to reconstruct her case. Slowly he tries to bring Grace closer and closer to the actual event, trying to unlock the mental chest holding the recording of that fateful day.The novel is quite interesting in its structure. Each section begins with an image of a quilt pattern, with additional poetry, citations from newspapers and historical documents, quotations from witnesses, confessions, etc. Grace's monologues are interchanged with Dr. Jordan's correspondence with his friends and family. Even it's generally classified as historical fiction, it has all captivating power of a fine detective thriller, a classic whodunnit, or as in this case shedunnit. Even though the verdict is in and the suspect is in prison, the jury is still much out, and as the pages turn the reader becomes more and more captured by the interplay of Grace's account, which shows her naivete and lack of education, yet reveals an intelligence and cleverness, and Simon's correspondence, research and tries to find the answer to the question which begins to haunt him: who is Grace Marks?Margaret Atwood is without a doubt one of the finest prose stylist, and her unique skill of weaving multiple layers of the story, combined with a vast research of the period she's writing about and relaying them in a rich and lyrical language true to time, place and character is incredible. She is also a poet, and while I have never read her poetry I think that I am not that far away by saying that she is a poet who choses to work with prose from time to time. Simple, everyday things are relayed in a way that immediately captures attention and demands a second look. Consider the opening paragraph:Out of the gravel there are peonies growing. They come up through the loose grey pebbles, their buds testing the air like snails\u2019 eyes, then swelling and opening, huge dark-red flowers all shining and glossy like satin. Then they burst and fall to the ground.Or the opening of chapter 27:Today when I woke up there was a beautiful pink sunrise, with the mist lying over the fields like a white soft cloud of muslin, and the sun shining through the layers of it all blurred and rosy like a peach gently on fire.There is a special quality which few writers posess; the ability to construct a scene, using language which is concise yet elegant, beautiful even, and create an image which stays in the mind, like a burning peach. The novel is worth reading because of the sheer excellence of the language, but together with a skilfully unfolded and unpredictable plot and a rich tapestry of themes it becomes a work which is versatile and more than well worth the invested time.Alias Grace is a beautiful and haunting novel of murder, madness and methodology; it is a fine contribution to the canon of Canadian literature from one of the nation's best known and revered authors. A period piece rich in details of life in the Victorian Canada West, about the importance of class and status, the role of women in the society, the period of history where they were still treated as the feebler sex combined a psychological mystery with all the elements of a great thriller, with excellent characterization and brilliant yet unpretentious language. Even with all its darkness and seriousness of the mystery and situations, Atwood manages to employ humor in the narrative, in a way that is fitting and funny in a good way. It's a spellbinding book that anyone can pick up and become lost in the rich world that it paints, trying to figure out the mystery together with the people that populate it. A great example of combining all the mentioned elements with the the art of exquisite storytelling, Alias Grace is guaranteed to make you think long after the last page has been turned."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony", "userReview": "It really happened. In 1843, in a remote Canadian farmhouse, James McDermott killed his employer, Thomas Kinnear, and Kinnear's housekeeper and mistress, Nancy Montgomery. The two open questions were: 1) was the 15 year-old servant Gracie Marks the paramour of McDermott; and 2) was Grace involved in the murder?Oh, people wanted to believe the worst. McDermott and Marks were found in flight across the border in the States. There wasn't much of a trial. McDermott was easily convicted and would hang. Marks was convicted as an accessory, both before and after the crimes. Her death sentence was commuted. She spent most of her life in prison, a lunatic asylum, but eventually a kind of 19th Century work release program as a servant to the governor.It is in this last venue that Margaret Atwood re-imagines it all by having a doctor of some nascent psychiatry conduct a series of interviews with Grace. We see Atwood here at her most brilliant, channeling the voice of Grace Marks, and thereby telling the story, but also placing it in time and place. But we also see the Atwood who can be clunky with plot construct and attendant characters. A cynic might think some of it was done just to pad the book. And of course all of the men - all of them - are worthless biological scum.So what of the 'the two open questions'? Well, Atwood fuzzies them, perhaps for artistic reasons, perhaps because she herself is not sure. I noted that Grace, in the re-telling, begins to call McDermott 'James' around the time of the killings. Maybe that was a subliminal message coming through. And, of course, Grace was involved in the murders. The question is to what extent. You, like me, will have to read the book for that.As Grace tells her story, she quilts. In the reminiscence, she tells this:The pattern of this quilt is called the Tree of Paradise, and whoever named that pattern said better than she knew, as the Bible does not say Trees. It says there were two different trees, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge; but I believe there was only one, and that the Fruit of Life and the Fruit of Good and Evil were the same. And if you ate of it you would die, but if you didn't eat of it you would die also; although if you did eat of it, you would be less bone-ignorant by the time you got around to your death."}, {"userName": "Mayra", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1967563-mayra", "userReview": "After so much YA, I had forgotten that trance you get after finishing a really good, complex book, when your mind just whirls all you have read over and over for an hour after finishing, connecting the many, expertly guised threads."}, {"userName": "Amanda - Mrs B's Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16323644-amanda---mrs-b-s-book-reviews", "userReview": "*https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.comMargaret Atwood\u2019s Alias Grace is a novel that provides a recreation of a true event in history, the murder of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper/lover Nancy Montgomery. The shocking part about the double murder of these two souls, is that their sixteen year old housekeeper Grace Marks, along with another employee of Thomas Kinnear\u2019s, James McDermott, were charged with the crime. Atwood\u2019s book begs the reader to consider whether or not Grace could commit this crime. There are plenty of grey areas which the reader is able to play an active role in colouring in.In the year 1843, a young housekeeper by the name of Grace Marks is jailed for killing her employer, Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper/mistress Nancy Montgomery. It almost seems unfathomable that a 16 year old housekeeper could commit such an atrocious crime. With Grace\u2019s conviction comes much doubt. Some people are of the opinion Grace was insane, others hold her completely responsible for the crime, while others believed she may have been manipulated to commit the crime with fellow employee James McDermott. After a stint in mental asylum, Grace is now serving a life sentence for the crimes she has been charged with. Grace appears to have blocked the whole crime from her mind and it is the job of an expert, Doctor Simon Jordan to draw out the truth, in the form of a series of one on one interviews with Grace. Doctor Jordan\u2019s methods are progressive for the time and he experiments with hypnotherapy in an effort to expose the truth once and for all on this crime. It is hoped the Doctor can help Grace gain a pardon, releasing her from the life sentence. When the Doctor comes closer and closer to the truth, what he uncovers is a complex and enthralling case. Can he help draw out the truth and put this crime to rest?I am going to be truthful and admit that I was drawn to this book by the Netflix television series alone. I was intrigued by the series and wanted to discover a little more about this fascinating historical crime, which was what I was hoping to gain from reading the book. The book and the television series do align, I believe Atwood was involved in the screenplay of the series, which is perhaps why it remains true to the book.What the book does offer is a great mix of mediums in presenting this story. Readers of Alias Grace receive a combination of prose styles. These include letters, legal documents, articles, patient notes, poems and Grace\u2019s first hand recount of the events that occurred in her young life, which she relays to Doctor Jordan. In using this style of narration, Atwood keeps the reader on their toes, so that shifting through all the evidence presented becomes an interesting and active experience. I have to admire Atwood\u2019s skill as a storyteller to bring all these aspects of a long lost case together, in the one cohesive tale.Atwood\u2019s historical grounding is remarkable. I enjoyed the experience of being transported to Canada in the 1800\u2019s. I also enjoyed Grace\u2019s thorough recount of her life, which gives the reader a picture of what life was like for those who lived in this era. Atwood charts Grace\u2019s life from the very beginning, starting from her departure from her homeland of Ireland with her family, in search of a better life in Canada. Atwood provides a detailed account on Grace\u2019s traumatic migration by boat to Canada, along with the ill treatment Grace received from her father, through to the places of Grace\u2019s employment and her fateful placement as a servant to Thomas Kinnear. The book also covers Grace\u2019s trial, incarceration and time in the mental asylum. As well as being very moving, there is a great deal of historical accuracy that emanates from the pages of this novel.Atwood matches her well represented historical setting with richly detailed characters. There is Grace Marks, the driving force of the novel, who is deeply intriguing but often appears to be an unreliable narrator. Backing Grace up are a collection of secondary characters that all have firm place in this novel. The most compelling aspect of the characters in this novel is the relationship between Grace and Doctor Simon Jordan.For those who like their novels wrapped up in a neat bow by the end, I would suggest this novel is not for you. This case is overwhelmingly strange and ambiguous. Atwood strives to stick to the facts but in doing so, she does not offers a concrete resolution to Grace\u2019s case. History tells us Grace was pardoned and released, many years after she was first convicted, so perhaps that is your answer. I\u2019m still sitting in the fence with this one and I haven\u2019t made my mind up as to whether Grace truly did commit this crime or what her level of guilt was, if any. I\u2019ll leave it up to you make that judgement if you select this novel to read. I greatly welcome your thoughts on this complex historical case!*Book \u2018a\u2019 of the a-z author challenge 2018."}], "description": "'Sometimes I whisper to myself: Murderess. Murderess.
