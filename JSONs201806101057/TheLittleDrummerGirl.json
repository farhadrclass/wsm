(...) To know, really and absolutely know, that there's a Divine Being not set in time or space who reads your thoughts better than you ever did, and probably before you even have them? To believe that God sends you to war, God bends the path of bullets, decides which of his children will die, or have their legs blown off, or make a few hundred million on Wall Street, depending on today's Grand Design?\u201d\nJoseph proved to be more than just a fan with flowers.Charlie is an English actress who has been reasonably successful on the stage and is one good role away from becoming an established actress when she meets a man on a beach in Greece. He isn\u2019t like any other man she has ever met before. He has scars, unusual scars, scars that denote the violence that has been done to him, and because he was still alive she could assume that he had perpetrated violence, effectively, against his enemies . \u2019That Joseph was Jewish she had not doubted since her abortive interrogation of him on the beach. But Israel was a confused abstraction to her, engaging both her protectiveness and her hostility. She had never supposed for one second that it would ever get up and come to face her in the flesh.\u201dCharlie\u2019s head is full of half formed radical left wing ideas about politics and social issues. She is promiscuous, always needing a man in her bed, and pretty enough to never have to look far for candidates. She thinks she understands what men want, but Joseph is an enigma who runs hot and cold. He keeps her emotions rising and falling like a stock market beset by outside forces beyond her understanding. He wants more than sex from her. He wants her life. Joseph is an Israeli spy and his job is to reel Charlie in for his boss Martin Kurtz. Martin is known by many names. He keeps several identities carefully separated in different files in his mind. He is a sword for the cause of Israel. He will use anyone or anything to protect his country. He has hand selected Charlie for a very specific task.\u201dYou are definitely bastards. Wouldn\u2019t you say so?\u201d She was still looking at her skirt, really interested in the way it filled and turned. \u201cAnd you are the biggest bastard of them all actually aren\u2019t you? Because you are the biggest bastard of them all actually, aren\u2019t you? Because you get it both ways. One minute our bleeding heart, the next our red-toothed warrior. Whereas all you really are--when it comes down to it--is a bloodthirsty, landgrabbing little Jew.\u201d\nNotorious with Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant.The relationship between Joseph and Charlie reminded me strongly of the Alfred Hitchcock movie from 1946\u2026Notorious...which is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. T. R. Devlin (Cary Grant) plays a government agent who is tasked with recruiting Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) to infiltrate a Nazi organization. Alicia falls in love with Devlin and he with her, but the job takes precedence over any personal feelings he might have for her. He has difficulties fully trusting her very evident feelings for him because of her promiscuous past and he certainly doesn\u2019t trust his own feelings for her either. There are some poignant scenes with rich, weighted dialogue where if either one would be completely honest with the other the personal would override the professional charade of their relationship. Alicia wants to be saved, but she also wants to please Devlin by doing what he wants. Joseph and Charlie find themselves in a very similar circumstances. Joseph would betray his country by saving her and Charlie would disappoint Joseph by refusing to go forward. They interrogate Charlie, breaking down her past, her beliefs, and her personality to better weave her own life with the fabricated life they want her to assume. John Le Carre\u2019s writing is simply brilliant in these scenes. It is painful to see Charlie having to face the reality of her own life and then having it wrenched and transfigured into a new reality that will best allow her to use her acting skills to convince an elusive Palestinian Bomber that she was once in love with his brother. \u201dShe was holding back her tears with a courage they must surely admire. How could she take it? they must be wondering--either then or now? The silence was like a pause between screams.\u201dThrough it all she was praying that Joseph would stop them. She hoped he would be her savior, her protector, and shelter her from the violent world they were asking her to be a part of. Like T. R. Devlin in Notorious Joseph remains silent. \u201dJoseph emerged\u2026. He came to the foot of the steps and looked up at her, and at first it was like staring into her own face, because she could see exactly the same things in him that she hated in herself. So a sort of exchange of character occurred, where she assumed his role of killer and pimp, and he, presumably, hers of decoy, whore, and traitor.\u201d\nThe Master Spy Novelist, John Le Carre.John Le Carre transcends the genre with this book. This is not just a spy book. Readers who struggle with this book are expecting a page turning thriller along the lines of a Robert Ludlum book, but this is so much more. This is literary espionage that challenges the reader with intricate details including the thoughts of the interrogator and the thoughts of the one being interrogated moment by soul wrenching moment. The book also explores the deeper human elements of what it really means to die for an idea, for a cause. As the plot advances Charlie also experiences the changing alliances that can happen as one becomes intimate with people you once perceived as enemies. Walking in the shoes of those you don\u2019t understand blurs the lines of who is right and who is wrong and the black and white world in your head becomes a paler shade of both. \nThere is a 1984 movie starring Diane Keaton where Charlie is changed from an American actress instead of an English one. I have not seen the movie, but intend to very soon. This is not an entertainment, but a marvelous piece of literary writing along the lines of Fyodor Dostoevsky or the very best of Graham Greene. I\u2019ve read a lot of spy novels, and intend to read many more, but I must say without any reservation this is the best espionage/spy novel I\u2019ve ever read and among one of the best books I\u2019ve read from any genre.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt", "userReview": "\u201c[W]e want to offer you a job. An acting job\u2026The biggest part you ever had in your life, the most demanding, the most difficult, surely the most dangerous, and surely the most important. And I don\u2019t mean money. You can have money galore, no problem, name your figure\u2026The part we have in view for you combines your talents, Charlie, human and professional. Your wit. Your excellent memory. Your intelligence. Your courage. But also that extra human quality to which I already referred. Your warmth. We chose you, Charlie. We cast you. We looked at a big field, many candidates from many countries. We came up with you and that\u2019s why you\u2019re here\u2026\u201d-\tMartin Kurtz, in John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s The Little Drummer Girl The spy novel is a very particular genre with a very particular audience. Generally, I don\u2019t count myself a fan. When my book club read Alan Furst\u2019s Spies of the Balkans, everyone loved it. As in, really loved it. They talked about it for hours. And I just sat in the corner with a fake smile on my face, wondering: What the hell did I miss? There is nothing wrong with spy novels. For the most part, there is nothing wrong with me. It\u2019s just not my thing. Thankfully, John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s The Little Drummer Girl is far more than a spy novel. Oh, to be sure, there is espionage galore. But it is also a morality play, an exploration of belief, and a serious glimpse at both sides of the seemingly-endless conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. This is a novel that hooks you from the first lines and never lets go:It was the Bad Godesberg incident that gave the proof, though the German authorities had no earthly means of knowing this. Before Bad Godesberg, there had been growing suspicion; a lot of it. But the high quality of the planning, as against the poor quality of the bomb, turned the suspicion to certainty. Sooner or later, they say in the trade, a man will sign his name\u2026That man is Khalil, blamed for a series of bombings, including the one in Bonn that opens the proceedings. Hot on Khalil\u2019s trail is Kurtz, an Israeli operative who cooks up a plan to find him. Kurtz is a very familiar character, the ultra-smart and utterly dedicated spinner of webs, entirely confidence in every action he takes. Yet Le Carr\u00e9 draws him indelibly, so that though he feels an archetype, he is also inimitable: Everywhere [Kurtz] went, he had been squaring things and checking out results, gathering help, persuading people, feeding them cover stories and half-truths, overriding the reluctant with his extraordinary restless energy and the sheer volume and reach of his advance planning, even when sometimes he repeated himself, or forgot a small instruction he had issued. We live for such a short time, he liked to tell you with a twinkle, and we are far too long dead. That was the nearest he ever came to an apology, and his personal solution was to relinquish sleep. In Jerusalem, they liked to say, Kurtz slept as fast as he labored. Which was fast. Kurtz, they would explain to you, was the master of the aggressive European ploy. Kurtz cut the impossible path, Kurtz made the desert bloom. Kurtz wheeled and dealed and lied even in his prayers, but he forced more good luck than the Jews had had for two thousand years.The plan Kurtz devises, with the help of a younger prot\u00e9g\u00e9 named Joseph, is to recruit an actress into the \u201ctheatre of the real.\u201d That actress, a young Englishwoman named Charlie, will be convinced to portray the girlfriend of Khalil\u2019s brother, Salim. The Israelis will then use her to get close to their prey. To tell you more would be \u2013 well, it would be a couple things. First, a spoiler. Second, impossible. The plot here is dense, multilayered, a maze overlaid on another maze.Twists and turns are all well and good. What makes the unraveling worthwhile, though, is the characters. No matter how farfetched things get, no matter the number of crosses and double crosses, Le Carr\u00e9 grounds everything in his creations. Kurtz, of course, is unforgettable, but it is Charlie that must bear The Little Drummer Girl\u2019s moral weight. She begins as a stereotype, a flighty actress with superficial left-wing politics. When the Israelis quiz her on her worldview, she has only glib responses with which to answer. As she sinks deeper into her role, however, she comes to see the Middle Eastern struggle firsthand. This is what separates the good from the great; this is what makes The Little Drummer Girl an enduring book, a relevant book, 35 years after it was first published. On its face, Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s story is boilerplate: heroic Israelis track down mad Arab bomber. And to be frank, Le Carr\u00e9 stacks the deck in favor of his Israeli characters, especially the charismatic Kurtz, who gets the most reasonable speeches. Despite this, Le Carr\u00e9 works hard to present the Palestinian viewpoint as well. To give some insight into their plight, their worldview, their reality. In one sequence, Charlie goes to a refugee camp to train: There is a terrible, yet pastoral peace that comes from living for a long time among the world\u2019s real victims. In the camp, Charlie experienced at last the sympathy that life till now had denied her. Waiting, she joined the ranks of those who had waited all their lives. Sharing their captivity, she dreamed that she had extricated herself from her own. Loving them, she imagined that she was receiving their forgiveness for the many duplicities that had brought her here.The farther she goes in impersonating Salim\u2019s girlfriend, the harder it becomes for her to distinguish the simple binaries she had been taught. Who is right? Who is wrong? She becomes mired in a Dimmesdale-like quandary, losing track of her two faces, \u201cbewildered as to which may be true.\u201d It is worth noting that Le Carr\u00e9 was friends with the American freelance journalist Janet Lee Stevens. She was sympathetic to the plight of Palestinian refugees, and visited the camps with Le Carr\u00e9 at her side. She was known, in the camps, as \u201cthe little drummer girl,\u201d because of her passion for their cause. Stevens wrote powerfully about the massacre of the Sabra and Shatilla camps, perpetrated by Christian militias while the IDF looked on. Le Carr\u00e9 certainly makes an effort with The Little Drummer Girl to show both sides of a bloody coin. If he doesn\u2019t find a perfect balance, it might be that that balance is not attainable. There is a place in this world for the trashy novel, the guilty pleasure, the beach read. This is something I truly believe. As Kurtz would say, life is short and death is long, so you should enjoy it where you can. But it\u2019s worth mentioning \u2013 and celebrating \u2013 the rare novel that can do both. A novel that can entertain and teach; that allows you to escape into false worlds, but also understand this one a little better."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1480539-rob", "userReview": "An amazing novel. I was a le Carre fan coming in, but this book's explorations of identity and morality blew my mind while simultaneously blowing up lots of other stuff. It's a story about Zionists, Palestinians, and bombs. And love and identity and morality. It's complex as hell; the identity stuff is on a PK Dick level, but goes there without drugs. The morality issue may be closer to common, as we are given Palestinians and Zionists and why they are who they are, but le Carre never overtly politicizes. Part of the point here is the complexity of the politics, but a greater point is how it affects people. And that's what this story comes down to: people. Fucked up beyond belief, often to a large extent by choice (because once you've chosen a political side and taken it to a certain point, you have no other choice).The characters are fully drawn, developing as the story goes to the point that they develop the story, but they do it in the context of an intricately written plot.This is a masterpiece. No Smiley, but the disappointment of his absence didn't last long. It's a beautifully written book, wry and harrowing."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "I found this novel extremely disturbing, and the movie version starring Diane Keaton even more so. Perhaps it's because I'm half-Jewish, and family discussions regularly circle back to Israeli/Palestinian politics. The basic scenario in the book is that Mossad are concerned about a successful series of bombings carried out against Israeli targets by a Palestinian terrorist group. They want to infiltrate the organization, and recruit a young actress to help them. There are two scenes near the beginning that I quite often think of.In the first, the Mossad agent who later becomes Charlie's controller is making the initial approach. She's in the middle of filming a drink commercial; she's sitting under a beach umbrella with a handsome young guy, smiling and laughing as they sip from their glasses. When she's done, he comes up and congratulates her on her performance. She replies breezily:\"Oh, it's easy. You just have to think that the wine's making you want to fuck.\"I've never been able to watch a drink commercial the same way since.The second scene isn't as amusing. She's been recruited, and the controller is coaching her for her role. She has to be able to look plausibly passionate about the horrors inflicted on Palestinians. He tells her a story from 1948, where Israeli tanks were used to destroy a Palestinian village. He goes into detail about the blood, the deaths, the suffering, the appalling injustice. She's quite shaken. Then she asks him how he knows all these details. He must have been somehow involved personally? And he replies,\"I was in one of the tanks.\""}, {"userName": "mentor&muse", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18986285-mentor-muse", "userReview": "John le Carr\u00e8\u2019s The Little Drummer Girl is much more than a spy novel. At its heart is a compelling relationship \u2013 which just happens to be between an agent and her agent runner (or case officer) amid a fascinating plot to stop a terrorist bomber. But it\u2019s the genius and complexity of the relationship that raises The Little Drummer Girl to heights far above the limits of the spy genre. An intricate fiction is planned in order to infiltrate the bomber\u2019s network and bring him down. Michel, the bomber\u2019s deceased brother, will be used as the access point. Charlie, struggling English actress and ideological seeker, is recruited somewhat against her will to play the part of Michel\u2019s grieving lover. But fabricating a history between the two won\u2019t be easy. Not only must the bomber be convinced of the fictitious love affair, but also Charlie needs to be able to draw upon her memories of Michel and her feelings for him as if they are real.Words have power, and in this tale we see the power of the spoken word, sound and breath, to summon, to establish memory where there is none. Meet Joseph: battle-scarred Israeli hero and \u201call that a girl adrift could wish for in her savior.\u201d He\u2019s an enigma, a conjuror, both warrior and poet. Standing in for Michel, he manipulates Charlie, even as he\u2019s drawn to her. He walks her through scripted scenes of her imaginary life with Michel, making her go through the motions and say the lines he\u2019s written for her. At first Michel appears only as a cutout, a hallucination. But through the power of words, fiction becomes truth. And Charlie\u2019s lover becomes a chimera: Joseph and Michel superimposed one over the other, shifting in and out of sync, their outlines indistinct. At the conclusion of the novel we\u2019re so invested in this relationship that we want more. We want to continue beyond the final page, to see Charlie and Joseph heal and come into focus. The Little Drummer Girl deserves a wider audience. I think many readers who don\u2019t enjoy the spy genre probably just overlook it. And a note: don\u2019t expect it to be about politics. le Carr\u00e8 deftly avoids politics and manages beautifully to embrace characters on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."}, {"userName": "Quirkyreader", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5355311-quirkyreader", "userReview": "In this story LeCarre takes us on a trip into the schizophrenic world of creating legends and running spies. It was set during the early 1980's when terrorist bombings had become common place in Europe. And there were characters in this story that reminded me of the BaderMinehoff(sp?) Group. Even though some of the elements in this story are dated, it is still a powerful novel.And after a spate of reading not so great Le Carre novels, this one was very refreshing."}, {"userName": "Tom Marcinko", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15334605-tom-marcinko", "userReview": "I have a vague memory of a column by George Will, back when I used to read him, about this 1983 novel. If memory serves, Will was upset that le Carr\u00e9 depicts the Palestinians as having a point of view, or maybe of just acknowledging that they exist. He likened the book to a Harlequin romance. He hated the dust jacket, and the typeface. I don\u2019t like any of the choices we\u2019re given in the Middle East: choose one side or another, or say \u201ca plague on both your houses,\u201d or ignore it altogether. Le Carr\u00e9 doesn\u2019t like them either, and offers no answers, easy or otherwise. He sees the big picture so well I wonder how well he sleeps.Having only just read this novel, I\u2019m surprised that it was so controversial. It could probably be published today without creating a ripple. Unfortunately, though, it would not feel dated.I also remember not liking the movie with Diane Keaton. It seemed bowled over by its own premise: Wow, an actress, prone to fabulation, playing a part\u2014in real life! A-and forgetting that she\u2019s acting! Imagine that. But it\u2019s been a long time, and maybe I should give it another shot. As usual, though, as a novelist le Carr\u00e9 rocks. His gift for creating complex characters, for showing the small but telling gesture, his sense of humor, and his sympathy for his people\u2026it\u2019s all here. Sometimes I liked his characters, sometimes not, which I think is what was intended. Also, one of JLC\u2019s less labyrinthine plots. He can make real drama out of a situation that a lesser writer (most of us, I\u2019m afraid) would milk for just action or melodrama.His 1993 introduction relates some of the footwork he did to research this novel. I hope he\u2019s got a memoir in the works.He is conceivably our George Orwell. Can I be the first to say that? Probably not. He also reminds me of Joseph Conrad.As I\u2019ve said before, I found him too subtle and patience-trying in my younger days but now I\u2019m happily working my way through the catalog. Glad to have 7 or 8 unread JLC novels still ahead of me.

It frees us from our inferiority complexes, it makes us fearless and restores our self-respect.\u201dBriefly, they both smiled, though not at each other.To resort to violence was to throw all their hard-earned goodwill out of the window.

With time, just by holding it in focus, you find yourself remembering what a fatuous thing a car really is without man to give it meaning. And what a fatuous thing man is to have invented cars in the first place. After a couple of hours it is the worst piece of junk you have ever seen in your life. You start to dream of horses or a world of pedestrians. Of getting away from the scrap metal of life, and returning to the flesh. Of your kibbutz and its orange groves.

Helga and Mario were advancing the revolution without her assistance.The answer was in everything she had seen since the night she had signed on with the theatre of the real. For Palestine, it ran. For Israel. For God. For my sacred destiny. To do back to the bastards what the bastards did to me. To redress injustice. With injustice.

We all have both angels and devils in our nature and the irony is that when we try to invent one, we end up becoming the other. I love William F.

Unputdownable. One of his best novels and his female main protagonist is brilliantly realised. In awe of the writing craft displayed in this novel. Le Carre's skill at weaving backstory with a love story with a gripping political thriller is unique. Every time I read him I'm reminded again that he is a real novelist. Those saying it is slow are idiots and clearly have short attention spans and are of low intellectual ability - try one of those gaming game thingys where everyone gets killed in a minute then you reset. Basically, the great joy of le Carre, in all his novels, is the meticulous build up with superb characterisation and brilliantly written scenes. For me this is literary fiction at its very best with a thriller element. His writing is superb and reading him is to engage with ideas on so many levels. The backdrop of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict is as relevant as ever.

Your courage will be like money. You will spend and spend, and one night you will look in your pockets and you'll be bankrupt and that is when the real courage begins.This book is possibly the most complex le Carr\u00e9 novel I've read to date. This is the story of Charmian (\"Charlie\" to her friends, though she doesn't keep them for long). She's a talented British actress who, like many other talented artists, is penniless and jobless. She follows her abusive boyfriend from place to place, into anarchist sermons and even into pseudo-militant camps to show their support for Palestine. All of this makes her the perfect recruit for the Israeli intelligence outfit that is trying desperately to find the leader of a Palestinian terrorist cell. Gadi Becker (affectionately dubbed \"Joseph\" by Charlie) is sent to bring her in, despite the fact that three Israeli wars have burned him out and made him doubt his country. Charlie grows attached to him, to love him even--and that's when he sends her to deceive and help kill the people she once tried to help.I could try and try to describe how heart-wrenching and intricate this novel was. My book has so many little post-it notes sticking out of it at points that really grabbed me, but taking any segment out of context to quote it robs it of its impact. If you have any interest in what real spycraft is like, and if you only have the patience for one spy book, this should be it.

Given the broad spectrum of characters here (from Israeli intelligence agents to young members of the '70s counterculture to Arab guerrillas to European Marxist revolutionaries -- all of whom are worlds apart from Smiley's British \"espiocrats\"), I predict that this will go down as LeCarre's most ambitious project. Also, LeCarre somehow manages to create truly chilling scenes that take place in the sunny and warm settings of Greece and Lebanon. And then there's Charlie, as clever as George Smiley and as courageous as Alec Leamas...this is her story, and I think you should read it."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2100742-denise", "userReview": "This is one of the hardest books for me to get through. I'm still working it out, and it's worth it. I don't like slow reads normally, and this one started out all over the place. Boring, but if you get through the first several chapters, it gets much better. I AM interested in the girl's downslope into terrorism, if that is really what it is. I will let you know. My usual style is to finish a book in two to three nights. This one is taking forever! I cant give up on it though. There is a good story behind the slower writing. I respect the story being told, but it's not a quick easy read. I am however, enjoying it. If I'm going to put this much effort in, I'd re-read \"I'd like you to know that tomorrow we will be killed with our families\", which was incredibly important, yet a much better read; and that was NOT a fiction. If I'm going to actually put an effort into reading a Genocide, War, or Terrorism published novel, please wake me up in the morning so freaking mad I want to join the peace corps. Again, I'll have to let you know, after a few weeks, I'm only about 3/4 through. The next few reviews I do will be only a day to a week between. I have piles of books next to the bed since I read so much. As we move, I'm going to try to move to strictly electronic books. I probably read as much electronically as I do paper, but cant break the impulse book buying habit."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1620394-mike", "userReview": "Astonishing. It literally starts with a bang (Palestinian terrorists set off a bomb in Germany), but then Le Carre takes his wonderful sweet time setting up the plot. The recruitment and training of a young British actress by Israeli counterintelligence takes up two-thirds of the book. Her actual mission kept me on the edge of my seat for the final wrenching 150 pages. This 1983 book was Le Carre's first to leave Smiley behind and not center around British intelligence, and it's far and away one of his best."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34392099-stephen", "userReview": "His best, and for me that's saying a lot.

Le Carre does a good job in developing the character of Charlie, a cut-rate actress with radical left leanings suffering from low self-esteem, who is recruited as a mole to ferret out a terrorist bomber. The Mossad operatives are also well portrayed as cold and vengeful.Events in the story are disturbingly realistic showing the ruthlessness required for the counter-terrorist game. The author spent a lot of time researching this book in Lebanon and other places in the Mid-East, and clearly shows sympathies to the Palestinian plight. I liked it so much I read it twice. Not recommended for those readers only interested in thrills and action, which is general advice for all of Le Carre's works."}, {"userName": "Franti", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52090483-franti", "userReview": "Seconda esperienza con LeCarr\u00e9 dopo La Casa Russia e mi rendo conto di conoscerlo da sempre. Avido divoratore di adattamenti cinematografici quale sono i due libri che ho letto di questo autore mi confermano che la sua prosa \u00e8 lo stampino perfetto per sceneggiature di film di spionaggio fuori dal comune. O \u00e8 cos\u00ec o ha un avvocato agguerritissimo che gestisce le sue royalties poich\u00e9 gli adattamenti sono sempre molto rispettosi dello stile dell'autore. L'ossessione per i dettagli nel costruire i personaggi sembra dare rigide indicazioni anche ai direttori del casting poich\u00e9 LeCarr\u00e9 si sofferma sulle pi\u00f9 incredibili minuzie per conferire ai personaggi dei suoi libri una verosimiglianza che mi capita di rado di trovare nei libri. Ma il realismo della sua prosa non \u00e8 l'aspetto pi\u00f9 sorprendente di questo autore, bens\u00ec la sua capacit\u00e0 di insegnarti cos'\u00e8 lo spionaggio con tutta la dose di fantozziano squallore e noia che i film con Tom Cruise non mostrano. L'aspetto romantico dei suoi libri sta nel parlare di violenza e sopraffazione tra stati e individui facendola avvenire quasi sempre fuori dalla scena, quando il lavoro del bravo ufficiale dell'intelligence \u00e8 finito, quasi a significare che a menar le mani sono buoni tutti mentre pensare a come farlo per garantire il successo \u00e8 un lavoro per pochi eletti la cui esistenza \u00e8 avventurosa in senso non convenzionale. Le spie di Lecarr\u00e9 sono lettori, professori, teatranti, persone che assorbono informazioni come chiunque ma con l'intento di serbarle per uno scopo. E' questa caratterizzazione dei protagonisti di LeCarr\u00e9 che crea la magia dei suoi libri: le spie sono persone comuni, ma il lettore dei suoi libri diventa la vera spia nel cercare di carpire l'informazione utile nel mare di dettagli che LeCarr\u00e9 riversa sulla pagina. Cos\u00ec il lettore e il protagonista si specchiano l'uno nell'altro, due persone normali avvicinate dalla situazione di trovarsi a fissarsi attraverso una pagina e accomunate dallo scopo di trovare l'informazione tra i dettagli. Per quello che riguarda la Tamburina, John LeCarr\u00e9 racconta la violenza del conflitto sotterraneo tra Israeliani e Palestinesi prendendo le parti dei primi ma una volta giunti all'ultima pagina ci si ritrova a pensare di essere stati abilmente ingannati (o misinformed) su quale tra i due belligeranti meriti l'empatia dell'autore. Inutile provare a tenere testa a LeCarr\u00e9 che rimane una spia, un falsario e un forgiatore anche sulla pagina."}, {"userName": "Robert Spencer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7192627-robert-spencer", "userReview": "I don't know, I guess you either love him or he leaves you cold. This to me is one of his stronger novels. Yes, it's a slow burner, but all his best ones are. The question is whether or not it builds the slow burn to an intense heat (ref The Honourable Schoolboy) or just smoulders away to a damp fizzle (ref Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy). I think the first piece of advice I would offer is not to think of any of Le Carre's books as \"thrillers\". They are character studies that happen to be about spies mostly, with a hefty dose of critique for the state. But even if you make that step, there is an argument that Le Carre's characters, far from offering insightful portrayals, remain murky and unclear. For me, the sparse clues to inner turmoil are a fascinating pathway to insight. Some say his female characters are often two-dimensional - to readers of that camp, how did you find Charlie?"}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/304115-mike", "userReview": "You expect a certain amount of sexism in a John le Carre novel. Rightly or wrongly, it's usually the kind that you can dismiss by saying, that was just what it was like back then. This is not that kind of novel. The eponymous character is a woman who defines herself by the men who capture her: \"She hardly cared. They wanted her. They knew her through and through; they knew her fragility and her plurality. And they still wanted her. They had stolen her in order to rescue her.\" Or using sex as a metaphor for turning a female agent. Or the fun little jab at feminism: \"The only news items she followed with any loyalty concerned a female giant panda at London Zoo who was declining to mate, though feminists insisted it was the male\u2019s fault.\"le Carre is so good at describing the psyche of male cold war spies, but his descriptions of his female lead are unconvincing and patronizing"}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5198410-matthew", "userReview": "This was my first time to read John le Carre.

Le Carre later apparently admitted as much. The Alexis character, so prominent at the outset, has no real bearing on the plot.

The Zionist/Palestinian conflict is, alas, just as miserable today as it was more than 30 yeas ago when the book was originally published. Charlie's gradual but profound emotional involvement, taking her from actress to hypnotized collaborator, is just as vivid too. This is a remarkable book, deeply affecting.

Layers of plots. Layers of politics and cultures. But mostly, layers of human character. Yes, it\u2019s a spy thriller and there is certainly suspense in this story, but it is so much more. I\u2019d seen \u201cTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,\u201d with Alec Guiness years ago and sensed that Le Carre\u2019s style was more introspective than Ian Fleming\u2019s action oriented 007 thrillers. I was not prepared, though, for the surprising depth of character psychology that Le Carre so superbly presented in this complex story. Basically \u201cThe Little Drummer Girl\u201d is the story of conflict between two cultures, Israeli and Palestinian using a third party, a young British actress, as the foil played by the two opposing worlds. Yes, it took me a bit of time to get into this book; I think I was expecting more action, but as I realized the most of the action was mental I began to appreciate the quality of Le Carre\u2019s writing craft. I am always searching for story flaws, holes that make no sense, elements dropped in that don\u2019t relate to anything else. I found no such flaws in this complicated story. Even the smallest details were considered, as evidenced by the simple yet brilliant discovery that brought down the Palestinian terrorist at the end of the book.Yes, this is a superb spy thriller, but more importantly, it\u2019s an even more powerful story of the histories and emotions that have resulted in more than sixty years of conflict between Israeli\u2019s and Palestinians. Although this book was written in 1983, it could have been written yesterday for the tragic truths is tells.I recently listened to Le Carre\u2019 doing a BBC interview on YouTube. He must be in his eighties but his mind is brilliantly sharp, truly impressive. At this point, I count him as one of the ten most excellent fiction writers I\u2019ve crossed paths with.
