The writing is beautiful. I found myself rereading many passages because I wanted to see or feel what is described again. The writing is lyrical with amazingly visual descriptions of this rural area in the woods in the north of England. There's such a sense of place and I always hesitate to call a book atmospheric not wanting to overuse the term, but it is the best description I can come up. Yet, if I didn't know I was reading a novel taking place in northern England, I would have thought it was a novel of the south, of the American south. It's a slow burning narrative building up to the inevitable dark and violence of revengeful confrontation. Fourteen year old Daniel and his fifteen year old sister Cathy have been taken by their father John to live in this remote wooded area after Cathy is bullied and after their grandmother who cared for them passes away. Their elusive, almost mysterious mother seems to come in and out of their lives until their grandmother tells them one day that she won't be back. I never felt quite satisfied with not really knowing the mother's story, although later in the novel we get hints. Their father is a brute of a man, using his body to make a living fighting or working for evil men helping them to \"settle\" things. But now he builds a house for his children and tries to protect them from the outside world. What is clear is that John loves Daniel who is a gentle soul who keeps house and cooks and Cathy, the tomboy who hunts and is more like her father. They lead this isolated life, except for studying with their neighbor Vivian until the reprehensible Mr. Price, the legitimate landowner ( not the children's mother) shows up. So the story moves on another level, not just this individual family but the unfairness, the greed and awful treatment of workers and tenants by Price and others and things get complicated. I would have given this five stars if it weren't for the end scenes which felt a little over the top. However, I was so impressed with this debut novel which was nominated for the 2017 Booker Prize. Fiona Mozley covers a lot of ground - family love and loyalty, moral questions over fairness and greed and how justice is realized . I will be very interested in what she writes next.

The narrative is from the point of view of a 14 year old Daniel. Daniel, his sister, Cathy and their larger than life father, John, referred to as Daddy, relocate to a rustic area that their mother had come from. They had resided with their grandmother, but were bullied at school. After Cathy took on the bullies, the school blamed her, and Daddy relocates them to land that had once belonged to the mother, but poverty led to its sale. Their home in a copse is built from scratch, and a living is eked out through hunting and foraging. This is a story of poverty, class, land ownership, family dynamics and relationships, justice, gender roles, revenge and history.Daddy is a huge man with a fearsome reputation as an unbeaten bareknuckle fighter, with a simmering rage boiling just under the surface and fiercely tenacious in his belief in being independent. He places his trust on self reliance and family. Cathy and Daniel are close, but radically different from each other. Daniel takes after his mysterious mother, preferring to avoid conflict, taking over the domain of the home, cooking and cleaning, and growing fruit and vegetables. Cathy reflects her father more, she prefers the outdoors and prepared to fight for what she believes is right. Daddy wants them to receive some form of education and ropes in Vivien for this purpose. Daniel is drawn to Vivien, and the two develop a growing relationship. Daddy lends his menace and fists to locals for favours. He orchestrates and organises the community in rent strikes and withdrawal of labour in a challenge to the economic exploitation of the powerless workers. Price is portrayed as an exploitative rich landowner who bought their mother's land with no history, links or connection with the land. Both Daddy and their mother have a personal history with Price. The battlelines are drawn for an all out brutal outcome.Mozley paints a bleak and atmospheric picture of desperate poverty, family and conflict. Daniel and Cathy challenge the gender roles that society expects, with Cathy continuing the fight right up to the end. The story strikes primal chords in its focus on home, identity and the issue of belonging. I loved this novel but found the storyline uneven in a number of areas, such as the questionable authenticity in the character of Daniel. This is no way diminishes Mozley's achievement in this, her debut novel. I cannot wait to see what she writes next. A great read!

I would be very happy to see this book make the shortlist - there may be at least six better books on the longlist but none of them would benefit as much from the exposure, and this is a promising debut by a talented writer. This was the most unexpectedly welcome inclusion on the shortlist. Very disappointed to lose Reservoir 13, Home Fire and Solar Bones Mozley is studying medieval history, and her starting point is the story of Elmet, the last Celtic kingdom in England and later, to quote the epigraph by Ted Hughes \"a 'badlands', a sanctuary for refugees of the law\". Robin Hood is clearly another inspiration, as is the Yorkshire landscape and its recent political history.The story is narrated by Daniel, a rather effeminate teenage boy. The two other main characters are his \"Daddy\" John, a giant prize fighter who has a legendary reputation in the criminal netherworld of bareknuckle fighting, and his sister Cathy, a feisty tomboy who has inherited much more of her father's qualities. When their grandmother and guardian dies, and Cathy gets blamed for starting a fight with bullies at her school, John takes them to squat in a copse, builds a wooden house for them and survives by hunting and by lending his muscle to the locals in return for favours. John is fiercely independent, with integrity based more on natural justice than the law.John takes the children to be \"educated\" by Vivien, who lives in a neighbouring house and has a large and eclectic collection of books. I think this was necessary to explain the language the book is written in, which is a mixture of lyrical well written prose and reported speech in Yorkshire dialect.It soon becomes clear that they will not be left alone. The Robin Hood element of the story starts with the appearance of Price, who owns the land and many of the houses in the area. Price is something of a pantomime villain, but the issues he embodies are real enough - economic exploitation of poor tenants in an area that never fully recovered from losing its mining industry. John gets involved in fighting for the villagers, helping them to form a united front and leading a rent strike, and lending his muscle whenever bailiffs appear. This inevitably leads to a violent confrontation, which does become a little too melodramatic for my taste.Not by any means a perfect book, but it is a memorable one and I would be interested in reading whatever Mozley writes next."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "Fiona Mozley's \nElmet\n is one of the most lyrical, atmospheric books I've read in some time. The descriptions of this area of rural Yorkshire, and the environment that surrounds the main characters, are tremendously poetic and vivid, yet Mozley doesn't use more words than necessary to get the mood or her story across. It's almost as if she strove for a simple, no-nonsense tone befitting her salt-of-the-earth characters.In the book's epigraph from Ted Hughes, we learn that Elmet was \"the last independent Celtic kingdom in England...stretched out over the vale of York,\" as well as \"a sanctuary for refugees from the law.\" This is where 14-year-old Daniel lives with his 15-year-old sister Cathy and their father, in a house their father built himself. They are self-sufficient, living off the land around them.Their father, John, is known for his ferociousness as a bareknuckle fighter. He is a gentle giant yet a man not above using his fists to get what he needs or wants, or to punish those who have done wrong in his eyes. This behavior is inherited not by Daniel, who is happier tending to the family's dogs and serving as cook rather than protector, but by Cathy, who strikes back at her classmates who bully her. Their life is a simple, happy one, until Price, the greedy tyrant who owns most of the land in the area, begins to cause trouble. The more he wants to bleed his tenants dry, the more it angers them, especially John, who finds himself assuming a leadership position among his fellow tenants, uniting them against Price. They decide on a rent strike, and John defends the group when the bailiffs come to enforce laws on Price's behalf.As with any struggle between the haves and have-nots, the tension simmers until it hits a breaking point. And that's where \nElmet\n loses its way somewhat, veering a bit into melodrama and slightly less plausible events. While the book's conclusion isn't surprising, it still seemed a bit far-fetched to me, and that was disappointing. I also found a few of the characters, including Price, seemed a little two-dimensional, where there was potential to make them complex, flawed people.Amazingly, \nElmet\n is Mozley's debut novel, and it was a finalist for this year's Man Booker Prize. A few glitches notwithstanding, Mozley's storytelling is so assured, so compelling, that I have little doubt she's going to have an amazing career ahead of her. Is the book perfect? No, but it is tremendously memorable and beautifully written. It's one that has haunted me since I read it a week or two ago.NetGalley and Algonquin Books provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

They built on land their mother had once owned, but did no longer, near a copse and woods. They hunted,fished and used whatever the land provided. They didn't have much but they were happy, basically content. The descriptions of this natural setting are glorious, beautifully done,the changing seasons,\"Spring that came with a rush of color, a blanket of light, u filling insects and absent, missed prodigal birds on this prevailing sou'westerly.\"Their father was a large man, an unbeatable fighter, and when money was needed this is what he did, he used to use this skill to collect rents for Me. Price, but no longer. The land now belonged to Mr.Price and he only wanted to take and squeeze the most out of those who worked for him. The haves and the havenots, once again in battle, an unending cycle. He wanted, Danny's father to collect for him, and if he refused he would be thrown off his land. \"Coxswain was one of Prices friends. It was Price's landline all the land around here and Coxswain held it, ran the farm, worked the labourers hard for a tener a day and dobbed them in to the Dole office if they complained.\"So a lovely place, an temporary idyll is turned into a place of violence, and the before and after is jarring. Beauty next to horror. Narrated by young Danny the story becomes even more poignant, a story of a particular time and place, a story that is told in beautiful language of a time that will not come again for this young family. From the calm beginning the tension is increased by increments ,by events, until it becomes clear that their will be a day off reckoning and a young boy will be left to wonder. Yet, how this comes about is surprising, and unexpected. What an amazing talent this author is,her first book and it makes the Booker's short list. I can definitely see why."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Elmet by Fiona Mozley is a 2017 Algonquin Books publication. This debut novel, shortlisted for the coveted Booker Prize, is an absorbing, intense novel of suspense, which draws from the mini-trend of highlighting the lives of those living \u2018off grid\u2019, hand to mouth, shunning the traditional life embraced by most people.Cathy and Daniel live with their father, a prize fighter, in the rural woods of Yorkshire. Cathy is practical, smart, and insightful, while Daniel is a sensitive child who enjoys domestic chores, and art over physical activities and has a more optimistic outlook on life, ignoring harsher realities, if he can. He loves his father, accepts his occasional moodiness, and depends on his sister emotionally.But, as the story opens, the reader knows that something has happened to upset the family dynamic. As the story progresses, we know that whatever happened, it was catastrophic because this family is close, loyal, and definitely a firm unit, despite their unconventional lifestyle. This story surprised me. I was mainly curious about it because of its award nominations, and because it was a debut novel on top of that, and because the description of it reminded me of several books I read last year that featured alpha male fathers keeping their children out of school, teaching them to survive in the wilderness, and how to hunt and live off the land, but in those books, the sinister quality comes from within the family unit. However, in this case, the alpha father is making the decision to live away from society to protect his children. So, knowing the threat is coming from outside forces, it won\u2019t take long to figure out where the danger lies, which will give anyone a queasy feeling of unease. I was constantly preparing myself for that crescendo, but I never anticipated the hairpin curve the story would take. The prose is stunning with strong gothic tones which had me constantly reminding myself I was not reading a historical novel and wondering how the author captured that atmosphere within a setting I wouldn\u2019t have associated with it. There are many themes explored with such a stinging reality, stated harshly and emphatically and unapologetically. Gender roles, class distinctions, and the struggle against poverty is brutally forced onto the pages while the vividly drawn characters spiral towards their unstoppable destinies. Award nominees and winners often leave me feeling bewildered. I don\u2019t understand, sometimes, what caused a book to stand out within the staid world of literary critics. I end up scratching my head, wondering why the book left me feeling so underwhelmed after it received such high honors. But, in this case, the author and her style of writing made quite an impression on me, and for once, I understood why the book garnered such lavish praise. Again, this is a book that may not appeal to a broad audience. It is not necessarily the most upbeat novel, but while there is a form of retribution, you don\u2019t want to show up expecting everything all tied up in a nice neat little bow or expecting a warm and fuzzy happily ever after. Despite that, this journey is one I am glad I took. I\u2019d go so far as to say it as powerful as it is unsettling and stayed with me long after I turned the final page. I will certainly keep an eye on this amazing writer!! 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "4.5 Stars \n\u201dWe arrived in summer when the landscape was in full bloom and the days were long and hot and the light was soft. I roamed shirtless and sweated cleanly and enjoyed the hug of the thick air. In those months I picked up freckles on my bony shoulders and the sun set slowly and the evenings were pewter before they were black, before the mornings seeped through again. Rabbits gamboled in the fields and when we were lucky, when the wind was still and a veil settled on the hills, we saw a hare.  \u201cFarmers shot vermin and we trapped rabbits for food. But not the hare. Not my hare. A dam, she lived with her drove in a nest in the shadow of the tracks. She was hardened to the passing of the trains and when I saw her I saw her alone as if she had crept out of the nest unseen and unheard. It was a rare thing for creatures of her kind to leave their young in summer and run through the fields. She was searching. Searching for food or for a mate. She searched as if she were a hunting animal, as if she were a hare who had through again and decided not to be prey but rather to run and to hunt, as if she were a hare who found herself chased one day by a fox and stopped suddenly and turned and chased back.\u201d\nNarrated by young fourteen year-old Daniel, a boy who is drawn to nice things, a boy whose hair is worn long and who prefers to cook rather than hunt; whereas his fifteen year-old sister Cathy might be seen to take after their father, preferring to hunt, and more than willing to defend herself physically. \n\u201dI came to prefer the inside to the outside, the armchair, the blankets and cushions, the tea and the teacakes, the curtains and the polished brass, and Vivien\u2019s books, and the comfort of it all. And while I sat and read and drank tea, Cathy walked or ran through the fields and woods and, in her own way, she read the world too.\u201d\n Through Daniel\u2019s eyes, there are occasional brief glimpses of his view of this time as memories, but the majority of this is seen in the present.When Cathy is forced to defend herself physically at school against some bullies, the school takes the side of the boys who instigated it because, in their eyes, these are \u201cnice\u201d boys, from \u201cnice\u201d families. And so they move away, to the property once owned by their mother, and their father begins to build a new house with help from his children. Their father is known throughout Ireland, Scotland and England for his physical strength, his massive physical presence. Vivien is their neighbor, and John takes the children to her for their continued education in her home, a home filled with books, a wide and varied collection of books. Mr. Price is the landlord to most in this area, and not very happy about others trespassing on their land or taking anything he considers to be his. Their land, their wildlife. And so Mr. Price and his two sons Tom and Charlie pay a visit to their new home.\n\u201dThese boys were just so handsome. They were so much more handsome than me and Daddy, we could not even be compared. We were almost distinct breeds, adapted to different environments, clinging to opposite sides of the cliff. It was as if Dad and I had sprouted from a clot of mud and splintered roots and they had oozed from pure minerals in crystalline sequence. \u201cThey spoke and laughed with deep voices that were not like Daddy\u2019s. They were smoother, though muted with vocal fry. The sound resonated against the cool air like a ball bouncing on wet grass.\u201d\nThis is a story of the haves vs. the have-nots, the wealthy vs. the poor. Those who hold the power against those who have no power other than their own physical strength. There is an element of this that is reminiscent of Robin Hood, and as others in their village are brought in to this story, there is also a story of how quickly things can take a turn the tension rises. Home. Identity. A place to belong, to live a simple, peaceful life is all they are seeking.There\u2019s an essence of Gothic Noir to this story, and her writing in this has been compared to Cormac McCarthy, but I have only read The Road, and don\u2019t really see that comparison with only that book. I would say that this would appeal to those who enjoy Ron Rash / Wiley Cash / David Joy / Taylor Brown\u2019s stories with a dash of Travis Mulhauser. The softly drawn dark natures found in Ron Rash\u2019s work, the simply lovely way Wiley Cash immerses the reader in the souls of his characters, the beautiful way David Joy manipulates the darkness in his stories into light with his lovely prose, Taylor Brown\u2019s ability to have you take each step with his characters, to inhabit these beautiful places, and Travis Mulhauser for his gentle wit, his ability to make you smile through all the darkness."}, {"userName": "Mercedes", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5124500-mercedes", "userReview": "4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne", "userReview": "ALL THE STARS!

I knew this probably wasn't going to end well for the family at the heart of this story - father John (\"Daddy\"), son Daniel and daughter Cathy - and I just didn't want to let go of them or their story. (P.S. No spoilers here; you will learn as much reading the synopsis of the novel on its dust cover.)This is the most Ron Rash-y book ever NOT written by Ron Rash.\"Elmet\" is a debut novel by British author Fiona Mozley and takes place in Yorkshire, England.....but it reads like pure US southern gothic noir. It very much reminded me of Rash\u2019s \"The Cove\" or \"The Risen.\" I had to keep reminding myself of the setting, even though the dialect of the characters is clearly more Northern English than Appalachian.In the story, this tight-knit little family loves each other fiercely. They seek nothing more than to be left alone to live their lives on a small patch of land but the landlord and his band of henchmen will not let them be. Inevitably, tensions escalate into a jaw-dropping, wrath-of-God finale \u2013 good vs. evil, innocence vs. corruption, might vs. right.

The storytelling is her main concern here \u2013 the characters are not very deeply developed but I didn\u2019t feel that was a flaw. They were brought to life by their dialogue with each other and the nascent observations of the teen narrator, Daniel. His narration, simple but profound, gave the book its sincere and earnest vitalityThis debut novel was a Man Booker shortlist finalist for 2017.

I\u2019d love to see it win, though George Saunders seems like a shoo-in. You\u2019d hardly believe it\u2019s a debut novel, or that it\u2019s by a 29-year-old PhD candidate in medieval history. The epigraph from Ted Hughes defines \u201cElmet\u201d as an ancient Celtic kingdom encompassing what is now West Yorkshire. The word still appears in a few Yorkshire place names today. Metaphorically, Hughes notes, the region was a \u201c\u2018badlands\u2019, a sanctuary for refugees from the law.\u201d That\u2019s an apt setting for Mozley\u2019s central characters: a family living on the edge of poverty and respectability \u2013 off-grid and not quite legal.Daniel and Cathy Oliver \u2013 14 and 15, respectively \u2013 live with their father, John Smythe, in a simple house he built with his own hands in a copse. They mostly eat whatever they can hunt. Daddy is a renowned pugilist not above beating people up when they owe his friends money. Feisty Cathy is bullied by boys at school; when teachers don\u2019t believe her, she has no choice but to hit back. There\u2019s a strong us-against-the-world ethos to the novel, but underneath that defensiveness there\u2019s a sense of unease: Daniel, the narrator, isn\u2019t a fighter like his father and sister. He\u2019s a sensitive soul who\u2019s happiest cooking and playing with his dogs.Like the reader, Daniel watches in grim fascination as Mr. Price, a powerful local landlord, starts issuing threats. Price warns Daddy that his family is trespassing. If they don\u2019t leave he\u2019ll make life difficult for them. A group of tenants, many of them just out of prison and barely getting by, bands together to take revenge on Price, planning to withhold rent and farm labor until conditions improve. No longer will they accept \u00a320 payments for 10-hour work days. At first it seems their fight for rights might be successful, but Price and his goons retrench. Things come to a head when Price promises to sign their plot of land over to Daniel \u2013 if Daddy agrees to call off the strike and fight one last climactic match in the woods.The final 70 pages of Elmet blew me away: a crescendo of fateful violence that reaches Shakespearean proportions. This knocks all those Hogarth remakes (which generally, with the exception of Hag-Seed, adhere too slavishly to the plots and so fail to channel the spirit) into a cocked hat. Though oddly similar to two other novels on the Booker longlist that unearth disturbing doings in a superficially pastoral England \u2013 Reservoir 13 by Jon McGregor and Autumn by Ali Smith \u2013 Elmet achieves the better balance between lush nature writing and Hardyesque pessimism. Mozley\u2019s countryside is no idyll but a fallen edgeland:And if the hare was made of myths then so too was the land at which she scratched. Now pocked with clutches of trees, once the whole county had been woodland and the ghosts of the ancient forest could be marked when the wind blew. The soil was alive with ruptured stories that cascaded and rotted then found form once more and pushed up through the undergrowth and back into our lives.The characters usually speak in Yorkshire dialect, but where many authors would render the definite article as \u201ct\u2019,\u201d Mozley simply elides it. For instance, here\u2019s John shaking his head over the injustice of land ownership:It\u2019s idea a person can write summat on a bit of paper about a piece of land that lives and breathes, and changes and quakes and floods and dries, and that that person can use it as he will, or not at all, and that he can keep others off it, all because of a piece of paper. That\u2019s part which means nowt to me.The author is not entirely consistent with the transcription of dialect, though, and sometimes her use of spoken language is off: too ornate to be believable in certain characters\u2019 mouths, like Cathy or a man who comes to the door to deliver bad news late on. These are such minor lapses of authorial control that I barely think them worth mentioning, but take it as proof that Mozley will only get better in the years to come. This is a gorgeous, timeless tale of the determination to overcome helplessness by facing down those who might harm the body but cannot destroy the spirit.Originally published in August 2017 on my blog, Bookish Beck."}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "4+\u2699\ufe0f\u2699\ufe0f\u2699\ufe0f\u2699\ufe0fWhat did I just read?A Man-Booker short-listed nominee that did not live up to the teeth gritting that often ensues when I take one on.At times I was sure this was set in the American South even though from the outset it is made clear the setting is Yorkshire with its history of legend and medieval history.

Elmet was a surprise entry on this year's longlist, and it caused further upset by making the final six at the expense of much acclaimed novels such as The Underground Railroad and Solar Bones. So is this brooding debut deserving of its shortlist status, and can it go on and win the whole thing?The story is set in rural Yorkshire. Daniel Oliver is our narrator, a teenager who lives in a field beside a forest with his father and elder sister Cathy. \"Daddy\" has a fearsome reputation as a savage prize fighter, but he is also a gentle giant who loves his children dearly. The trio live off the land, hunting game and growing their own vegetables. Daddy built the house himself on a copse that was once the property of the children's mother, but now belongs to a Mr Price. Price is an unpopular multimillionaire who owns much of the local area, and the native resentment towards him is beginning to grow.As we learn from the book's Ted Hughes epigraph, Elmet was \"the last independent Celtic kingdom in England... stretched out over the vale of York.\" Dating back to the 5th century, it was \"a sanctuary for refugees from the law.\" It puts in mind a medieval setting, a community of lowly serfs ruled by an untouchable elite. Fighting, gambling and drinking are the pastimes of this turbulent world. With Daddy as the retired outlaw and Price the unforgiving landlord, it feels certain that their simmering dispute will end in bloodshed.Mozley writes exquisitely about the landscape of this rural kingdom. Daniel is very much at one with nature and appreciates the feral beauty that surrounds him: \"The dawn erupted from a bud of mauve half-light and bloomed bloody as I awoke.\" But there is a sense of danger in this wild environment which adds to the story's ominous tone: \"the ghosts of the ancient forest could be marked when the wind blew. The soil was alive with ruptured stories that cascaded and rotted then found form once more and pushed up through the undergrowth and back into our lives.\" Even the Yorkshire breeze is a violent character that must be tamed: \n\"The swifts were too light to charge at the gusts like gulls or crows, and through them I saw wind as sea. Thick, pillowy waves that rolled at earthen, wooded shores and threw tiny creatures at jutting rocks. The swifts surfed and dived and cut through the invisible mass, which to them must have roared and wailed as loudly as any ocean on earth, only to catch the air again on the updraft and rise to the crest.\"\nWhile I did enjoy this richly imagined tale, I'm not sure it has anything particularly new to say. Though the final scenes are exciting, there is an inevitability to the outcome. Too many of the supporting characters are two-dimensional, including the villainous Price. And though Danny's observations are often gorgeously expressed, they feel a shade too profound for a boy with such little education. The story's strengths lie in its atmospheric evocation of a lawless rural domain, and for this Fiona Mozley deserves to be commended. So I'm happy that I read Elmet, but at the same time, I'm a bit bemused as to why the Booker jury have singled it out for such praise."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul", "userReview": "A first novel from not too far from where I live and closer still to where I was born and I recognise the landscape. Elmet was shortlisted for last year\u2019s Man Booker prize. The title itself is redolent of the area which used to be the old Celtic kingdom of Elmet, which covered much of what is now Yorkshire. The last remnants are now place names such as Sherburn-in-Elmet. There is also a nod to Ted Hughes\u2019s work The Remains of Elmet. For a first novel this is very good and Mozley was also brought up in the area. She wrote the book on her daily commute and admits that it pulls in many ideas that interest her and are important to her, especially in relation to gender and oppression and she dedicates the novel to her partner Megan. The novel itself has been described by the reviewer in the Guardian as elemental and contemporary rural noir, both excellent summations of the whole. The novel is about a father and his two children. The father is referred to as Daddy throughout and the children are Cathy and Daniel, both early to mid-teens. They live on a patch of land where Daddy has built a house. There is a copse which they work and Daddy catches (possibly poaches) local game, Daddy is a prizefighter, one of the very best and he periodically disappears for a day or two, leaving the children to fend for themselves, which they are well able to do. There are some neighbours at a distance, one of whom, Vivien, occasionally looks after the children. Daddy also helps vulnerable members of the local community when the have problems with debt collectors and the like. The principal antagonist is a local landowner, Price and his two sons. At one time Daddy used to work for Price, but no longer. The whole of the novel takes place under the radar of the police and the established authorities and builds towards a violent climax. Some of the speech is vernacular, but still easy to understand. Mozley builds the personalities of the two children well. Cathy is very much like her father in approach to life and toughness whilst Daniel simply doesn\u2019t aspire to traditional male roles. Cathy feels as though she is almost out of a Bronte novel and is a force of nature, \u201cI\u2019m angry all time, Danny. Aren\u2019t you?\u201d Her name, perhaps deliberately evoking Wuthering Heights and she becomes the major figure in the book and her role at the end is fascinating and disturbing at the same time. Mozley plays with gender identification throughout the book. Daniel says at one point, \u201cYou have to appreciate that I never thought of myself as a man,\u201d and Cathy\u2019s appropriation of some traditional male attributes makes the ending stark and shocking. The writing about the landscape and nature captures a sense of place and can be quite vivid:\u201cThe dawn erupted from a bud of mauve half-light and bloomed bloody as I woke.\u201dThe narrative is compelling and the prose alive and immediate and Mozley does capture the plight of the downtrodden and disenfranchised in the bleaker areas of northern England. As the Spectator review rather archly points out, it isn\u2019t often a novel combines a spot of Leveller radicalism with a portrayal of gender privilege. As Daniel points out when his sister disrupts a boys football game:\u2018Even if she played, and even if she played well, it would always be their game.\u2019There are plenty of nods to other writers and films here, but the violence at the end is gruesome and truly shocking. I think, despite some flaws this is one of my favourite novels of the year and I will certainly be looking out for more of Mozley\u2019s work."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/It\u2019s only mid-April and I\u2019m already terrifyingly behind on reviews so I\u2019m gonna keep this one short and sweet:1.

Although the narrated time is not specified, the story does obviously take place in our modern days, in the realm of what used to be the medieval Brittonic kingdom of Elmet. John supports his family as a bare-knuckle prize fighter and day laborer, his wits and his physical strength being his most precious possessions. John is described as an almost mythical figure, with a body of nearly superhuman strength and endurance, and with an acute moral awareness. His ideas and ideals are informed by ancient concepts of justice, morality and self-reliance, and his character is reminscient of British folk hero Robin Hood and other mythological figures such as Grettir, infamous outlaw and hero of The Saga of Grettir the Strong. While John is an archaic male, his kids are presented as queer characters: Daniel grows his hair and nails, his sexuality remains somewhat ambiguous, and Cathy is a tomboy who takes after her father. The prospect of becoming an adult woman and everything connected to that is very painful to her and seems to contribute to the anger she constantly feels. The land on which John and his children built their house does not belong to them, Daniel's and Cathy's mother (whose absence remains mysterious) sold it to the capitalist Mr. Price when she fell on hard times. When Price wants to evict the family from their illegal building, John organizes a resistance to fight the tactics of greedy landlords and exploitative taskmasters in the area.I really enjoyed how Mozley transports classic elements of Southern Gothic into the British countryside: Eccentric characters, grotesque details, ambivalent gender roles, derelict settings, and the particular presentation of poverty and violence render this sinister tale special. Nevertheless, Mozley's prose has its limitations: \"The Guardian\" claimed that the language is modeled on Cormac McCarthy, but frankly, this is quite a stretch. McCarthy displays immensive narrative discipline and textual consistency with his direct, forceful prose. Mozley, however, lacks control and, as a consequence, does the copposite: Daniel's direct speech differs substantially from his narrative voice, and the text as a whole fails to present its narrator as a consistent character as his voice tumbles from overly lyrical descriptions and acute observations to the thoughts of a particularly simple-minded teenager. The moral theme, which, in itself, is highly interesting and current, could also have been developed a lot better. Of course housing should be affordable and wages have to be fair, but no one would like it if a family just came along and built a house on his property. This problematic tension, the forces that prompt John and Mr. Price to act as they do, could have been explored in a more thorough and, by that, interesting manner. Many reviewers criticised the book's climax that follows after the novel turns into a revenge tale as unrealistic and over-the-top - and I agree, it takes the element of the grotesque to another level, and there are good reasons to criticize it. Without giving away too much, my main issue with it was not the level of brutality, but that it tries to cover up ambiguities that clearly do exist. From another perspective, one could also say that Mozley elevates her text from a realistic story to one that seeks truth by employing biblical amd mythological narrative features and metaphors. A little flawed, but overall an exciting and worthwhile read. I am looking forward to reading Mozley's next effort."}, {"userName": "Vivian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3947172-vivian", "userReview": "Wow.

It sounded like just my thing and had a beautiful cover! My expectations weren't met, exactly, but I still think I would read whatever the author did next. Some of the observations she had other characters make, like when Vivien compares their father to a whale, were rather thought-provoking and unique. The only other page I marked is a few chapters later, when the narrator is reflecting on the whale analogy after his father hugged him upon his return home (and this is a good example of the writing): \n\"As soon as he had shaken off his boots, his Goliath arms pulled me into an embrace and I wondered what it would be like to touch a real whale, and knew that despite what Vivien had said, Daddy was both more vicious and more kind than any leviathan of the ocean. He was a human, and the gamut upon which his inner life trilled ranged from the translucent surface to beyond the deepest crevice of any sea. His music pitched above the hearing of hounds and below the trembling of trees.\"\nSo that's beautiful writing, to be sure, but it also serves to slow down the pace substantially, and as such I found myself frequently setting the book aside to read something else.I like how she describes places. I was less interested in the people, unfortunately. I kept getting confused as to the gender of the narrator, although later on in the novel that seemed more intentional maybe. I read the character as female until he started being addressed with a male name and then felt confused! Ha.This kept reminding me of Our Endless Numbered Days by Claire Fuller, although the tone of it isn't as ominous, but in a similar way where a father shapes a world for his children to live in, isolated from the rest of the world, their only reality. He builds a home for them on property he doesn't own, although that too is revealed later in the book to be quite a bit more complicated than this guy just being a hermit. And it isn't as if they are entirely isolated, so there is a tension between the life he would like them to have and the reality surrounding them.. he has to work, and is a fighter for money.

At it's heart 'Elmet' is the gritty story of a complex family dynamic and a good vs. evil battle that has us rooting for the questionably deplorable underdog. A solid 4 stars to start with, with a few days to mull over this story, this has crept up to a well deserved 5 stars from me.At the head of our tight knit familial trio, we have 'Daddy'. A violent and damaged man who is driven by a primal love and need to care for his family and those less fortunate. As Hugh referenced in his review (someone teach me how to link!?), Daddy has an almost Robin Hood type quality that endears us to him despite his obvious flaws. Whilst he clearly loves his children, he also lets them drink and smoke, exposes them to violence and often deserts them for long periods at a time. A bare knuckle fighter, for want of an honest trade, he manages to be a formidable fighter, masculine and intimidating, whilst carrying a fierce need to protect what is his and having a strong sense of honour.Fourteen year old Daniel, son of Daddy, narrates this story. A quiet, somewhat effeminate boy with a kind nature, who cares more about 'making house' than following in the barbarous footsteps of his father. His sister, the far less inhibited Cathy, is a year older and a clear tomboy. She is far closer to her fathers nature, and appears to take after him in looks too, both dark and brooding. There is a strength to her character that I think was really interesting to play with. Looking at the offspring of this man in this way, one boy and one girl, manages to say a lot about the intricacies of gender without doing so explicitly, and I felt this aspect of the novel was really unique.On the surface, this is a fairly uneventful story, yet the poetic language draws greatly on the landscape and creates a wonderfully rustic environment which acts as the backdrop to this curious life. For most of their lives Daniel and Cathy live with Granny Morley, who acts as a constant presence in their lives, whilst Daddy and the briefly mentioned (yet equally tortured) mother, flutter in and out of their lives. Their childhoods appear strained, but in many ways they live a normal life. Events lead Daddy to take his children away from this normality, to the place their mother was from. He builds a house purely from scratch sourcing materials from the surrounding forests, and they live primitively but happily. Unfortunately, but not entirely unintentionally, he happens to be building on a piece of woodland that isn't his to build on. From this point on, the melodrama begins to creep in, and we are drawn towards a surprising and intense climax.I really, really enjoyed this book. Whilst admittedly not for everyone, this is a fantastic debut, and Mozley has a voice that I definitely want to hear more from. I'd love some short stories from this author, another novel, to hear her speak - it's safe to say I'm excited for what might be to come. I'm so glad a novel like this is being recognised by the Man Booker Prize this year.

I kept seeing young Brad Pitt, scruffy faced and wiry, in Guy Ritchie\u2019s film about bare knuckle boxing. Bare knuckle fights apparently were (are?) a thing in the UK, if the story is to be bought into. We meet a man who is considered the best brawler in all of England and the children he loves.Narrated by a wispy teen with this giant hulk for a daddy and a fierce, beautiful big sis, he tells us how they came to live in Elmet for a time. He shows us the tenderness of his bear-like father who brings puppies home in repayment of debt. We see the boy\u2019s love of domestic chores, cooking for gatherings, his aversion to physical labor, and know he is marked as pretty-faced. I never really got a line on the big sister other than her height and beauty and that she preferred the out-of-doors to tutorship in books.When the boy talks of gender identity about at the halfway mark, it was no great shock considering the traditional female roles we repeatedly learned that he leans toward. This slightly bugged me as Ive got guy buddies who wouldnt be caught dead poring over recipes or examining the contents of a woman\u2019s lingerie drawer (possibly wanting to wear them or switch genders) and yet couldnt be more gay. But, I let it go that people are people - maybe this wasnt stereotypification (I invented that word!). My beloved uncle was out of the closet in the 1960s and was a fashion designer living in San Fran with his partner (in an adjacent apartment). Because I loved him so much my entire life, I confess to being a little bit sensitive about how gay characters are portrayed. If you paint a gay guy like he's Liberace, then he\u2019d better not just be a caricature. This teen was portrayed well, but my radar was up.Beyond that, the arc of the story was good but the villain was incredibly cartoonish. We didnt see any positives in him other than that he loved (we are told, not shown) his brutish boys. On the plus side, the boy\u2019s observations relating to houses that he deems fancy are really perceptive. When the home has a tall window flanking both sides of the front door, he sees wealth. He notices Range Rovers. Also he keeps in character while nosing about in someone\u2019s home commenting that their upstairs is not as tidy as the more public rooms. A toothpaste tube with a slight hardened ooze and sprinkles of make-up on the sink are things that a teen who loves to dust would notice, but not others. He compares his father\u2019s body to the muscular bulk of a whale. All this is well done.There is, however, a cataclysmic act that goes on off scene in the story, and once it is explained, it was so far-fetched that I kept waiting for something to redeem the tale - I mean, Man-Booker nominee? Other smaller inconsistencies bothered me a bit. Two of my girlfriends are dentists, but you do not have to be one to know that if someone slaps you on the jaw, your back molar is not going to dislodge and come flying from your mouth. Lastly, the big disagreement between the family of three and the bad guy is that they are squatting on his property. He is made out by the author to be an unreasonable man for not wanting random people building houses on his property. Um, I come from modest means and got myself through college and a very nice graduate school totally on my own. Until retirement, I did nicely for myself. Ditto for the hub. If people were to invite themselves to clear and build a house on my land, I would not be happy with that. At any rate, my complaint is that I had no complaint with the bad guy until he turned out to actually be bad. That his ugliness was instigated by the family of three wasnt pointed out, and I think the author missed out a lot by not bringing that forward. It would have been a nice touch, and I look forward to seeing what else she will write in future. 3 stars"}, {"userName": "Jonathan Pool", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27950748-jonathan-pool", "userReview": "I wonder if Fiona Mozley's English literature degree worked over the greats of English literature? DH Lawrence? Thomas Hardy? The Brontes?The influence of these writers, and the rural, unmodernised, settings of Elmet clearly indicates such influence.

An amalgam of Elena Ferrante's Lila, and Naomi Alderman's Roxy, 'strong' feisty no messing (young) woman. But no depth, not very original Price. The local grandee bigwig exploiting the put upon working man. This characterisation is an all too simplistic vehicle for the author to express Mozley's declared views about the wrongness of wealth disparity in post Thatcher Britain. Price does reflect, a couple of times, on the true nature of Daniel's born character. But this stutters and goes nowhere.Daniel. The ongoing ambiguity about his sexuality flickered but never ignited.Vivien. Much implied in this character, but unresolvedDaddy. A bare knuckle fighter. A descriptive passage which set out to parallel John Smythe and a whale, their bulk, their search for wider perspective, their grace... completely missed the mark.The three elements of Elmet that I least liked were:The chapterisation  Elmet had precious little narrative flow. There were some set piece descriptions of the landscape, and Jon McGregors  Reservoir 13 shows how this can be done as a (descriptive) character in its own right. Successive chapters in Elmet told individual, anecdotal, stories growing up: visit to Vivien; decorate a Christmas tree; meet Mr. Price. It was disjointed, there was no continuity.The ending. Mozley created a potentially interesting moral dilemma concerning theft. The opportunity was there for a new look at, a revision, of the character the reader had come to believe in. But this went nowhere and the grandstand finale was unnecessary and beyond credibility.The (faux)dialect.The Smythe family mostly spoke in straight English language. But to remind us that these were uneducated people Mozley mostly remembers to throw in 'handt' 'indt' 'dindt' 'wandt 'woundt' and 'nowt'  I had to check I wasn't reading a Monty Python script.Daniel was the character most likely to have his musings delivered in a northern dialect, so his extra education with Vivien wasn't seemingly very successful.A number of Goodreaders whose reviews I like and respect have praised Elmet. The Man Booker committee have longlisted this debut novel for 2017. So, I have to avow that sometimes a style of writing, characterisations, just grates at a personal level. I guess that's this book for me."}, {"userName": "Paul Fulcher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher", "userReview": "\u2018Means nothing to me.\u2019 \u2018I can help,\u2019 I said tentatively.

That\u2019s part which means nowt to me.\u2019Update: Now actually shortlisted for the Booker - which frankly feels a tad generous given some of the longlisted books that didn't make it - but still a promising debut.---------Amongst a list of hotly tipped books, big-hitters, former shortlistees and award winners, Elmet, the debut novel of Fiona Mozley, was the surprise inclusion on the 2017 Man Booker longlist. Indeed the only Goodreads review of the book at the announcement date was from an advanced reader credited in the author\u2019s afterword (the honour for the first post-listing review goes to Gumble\u2019s Yard - https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).Elmet isn\u2019t a striped elephant from a children\u2019s book but rather, per a quote from Ted Hughes Remains of Elmet, which serves as this novel\u2019s epigraph: \u2018Elmet was the last independent Celtic kingdom in England and originally stretched out over the vale of York \u2026 But even into the seventeenth century this narrow cleft and its side-gunnels, under the glaciated moors, were still a \u2018badlands\u2019, a sanctuary for refugees from the law\u2019 Nowadays the Elmet name is primarily known (at least to those of us interested in UK politics) for the Elmet and Rothwell constituency, one swinging increasingly to the Conservative party as working class communities are displaced by commuters into Leeds.The ancient area of Elmet also includes the Calder Valley, the setting for Gallows Pole, a novel I had tipped for and hoped to see on the Booker list, based on the very 17th Century Badlands that Hughes identifies \u2013 my review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...So was Elmet worthy of its place amongst such illustrious company on the Booker list, and indeed worth its place ahead of Gallows Pole?It is certainly an original and intriguing read.Mozley\u2019s novel is set in or near the present time \u2013 the text is oddly timeless but the references to the Bosnian and Iraq conflicts and Pendelino trains provide some clues.Daniel (almost 14) and Cathy (15), having lived for years with their maternal grandmother, move with their father to a house he is constructing deep in a copse:Now pocked with clutches of trees, once the whole county had been woodland and the ghosts of the ancient forest could be marked when the wind blew. The soil was alive with ruptured stories that cascaded and rotted then found form once more and pushed up through the undergrowth and back into our lives. Tales of green men peering from thickets with foliate faces and legs of gnarled timber. The calls of half-starved hounds rushing and panting as they snatched at charging quarry. Robyn Hode and his pack of scrawny vagrants, whistling and wrestling and feasting as freely as the birds whose plumes they stole. An ancient forest ran in a grand strip from north to south. Boars and bears and wolves. Does, harts, stags. Miles of underground fungi. Snowdrops, bluebells, primroses. The trees had long since given way to crops and pasture and roads and houses and railway tracks and little copses, like ours, were all that was left. Daddy and Cathy and I lived in a small house that Daddy built with materials from the land here about. He chose for us a small ash copse two fields from the east coast main line, far enough not to be seen, close enough to know the trains well. Their father is a giant of a man, the most feared bareknuckle fighter in all of England, taking on all comers in illegal prize fights the length and breadth of the land.The slap of shoes against the mud. Men stamping and rubbing their hands. Daddy and the Bear, their fists in guard. Barking dogs. Spitting men. A sticky wind. Ancient oaks arching their backs to cover the scene. The scent of diesel. Diesel, dirt, sweat, blood, burning meat, the sugars dripping from fried onions. A ring of men standing above rings of mushrooms, connected and hidden beneath the earth, and then rings of limestone. The first half of the novel sets the scene for their unconventional life. They aren\u2019t travellers, but neither are they conventional members of society, largely wanting to be just left alone. Even when living with their grandmother they didn\u2019t really fit in at school, bullied by the other children, and Daniel\u2019s mind often turns back to a time when his sister fought back against some boys tormenting them.I wondered if she thought about it too. Or if the boys did. Or if any of the other small people at the far reaches of my recollection spent the time that I had thinking about the bits in which they played a part. It seems to me that so much of everything came from this, and that if anyone thought about moments like this enough, the future would be done before it had even started, and I mean that in a good way. Although Daniel and Cathy were the victims. and the bullies got what they deserved, when the boys complain to their parents, the headmistress takes the boys side. Summoned with Daniel and Cathy to her office, Daniel is disappointed that his father accepts the headmistress\u2019s guilty verdict against Cathy, despite knowing her to be wholly justified in their actions:Mrs Randell\u2019s assessment was simply the way people saw things, he told us. It was the way the world was and we just had to find methods of our own to work against it and to strengthen ourselves however we could. Cathy responds:They were so nasty to me, Daddy. Not the pain, Daddy, I dindt mind that, but the way they made me feel inside. No matter what I do, I can never win. \u2018You did though. You fought them and beat them. You protected your little brother. What more could you do?\u2019 Daddy ran his hands through his hair and then his beard as if searching for an answer there. \u2018I mean it doendt matter, does it? I mean that things will always be as they are now. I mean that there will always be more fights and it will just get harder and harder. I feel like I\u2019ll never just be left alone.\u2019And as they live in their woodland home, their father brings them up to regard themselves as alone and needing to strengthen themselves rather than rely on others, an approach that Cathy wholly embraces:Cathy took Daddy deadly seriously in his attempts to train us against the world. She found a kind of solace in his tasks. She wanted to be every inch of him but believed what he said about how different she was, about how she had to be good at different things, how she had to find a different way of surviving.[...]Everything he did now was to toughen us up against something unseen. He wanted to strengthen us against the dark things in the world. The more we knew of it, the better we would be prepared. And yet there was nothing of the world in our lives, only stories of it. We had been taken out of our school and our hometown to live with Daddy in a small copse. We had no friends and hardly any neighbours. We obtained a form of education from a woman who dropped books lazily into our laps from a library she had developed to suit only her tastes and her own way of thinking.This woman is Vivien, an old acquaintance of their father\u2019s but very different, living a much more conventional lifestyle. When they are first taken into account, Daniel\u2019s sees her living room: the detailed recollection that he sets out (of which this is only part) is typical of his narration in the novel, perhaps relating to the aforementioned desire to remember things in detail, although the words don\u2019t always ring true in the character\u2019s mouth (and at times feel a little like padding):There was a deep sofa covered by worn blue velvet, with two large sitting cushions. They dipped to meet each other in the middle but were still quite plump at their outer edges. There was a blanket on one of the arms with a scene stitched together with red and white wool but obscured by the folds. There was a carpet atop a carpet, one grey and fitted to the size and shape of the room, and one a set rectangle with tassels on the two shorter edges and a pattern of lines and angles that I would have sat down on and traced my fingers over were I younger or alone. Daniel seems to be tempted towards the different lifestyle that he glimpses in his visits to their house, whereas Cathy can\u2019t settle down to study:I came to prefer the inside to the outside, the armchair, the blankets and cushions, the tea and the teacakes, the curtains and the polished brass, and Vivien\u2019s books, and the comfort of it all. And while I sat and read and drank tea, Cathy walked or ran through the fields and woods and, in her own way, she read the world too. The differences between Cathy and Daniel, and Cathy\u2019s greater affinity to their father, extend to a theme of gender confusion. Daniel is the homemaker, which causes his father some amusement:  \u2018Why am I funny?\u2019 I asked. \u2018Don\u2019t know. You like making house nice and that.\u2019 And Daniel himself remarks that he never really thought about gender:You have to appreciate that I never thought of myself as a man. I did not even think of myself as a boy. Of course, if you had asked me I would certainly have replied that that was what I was. It is not as if I had ever actively rejected that designation. I just never thought about it. I had no reason to think about it. I lived with my sister and my father and they were my whole world. I did not think of Cathy as a girl nor as a woman, I thought of her as Cathy. I did not think of Daddy as a man, though I knew that he was. Various people remark that Daniel more resembles his absent mother, both in looks but even fashion sense, which they sometimes mean as a compliment and others an insult, depending on their view of his father. Daniel admits:I have to admit, I wore my clothes in this manner because I had seen my mother wearing her clothes in this manner. I wore those little T-shirts and those too-tight jeans and I left my midriff bare because I had seen my mother do this. And nobody corrected me. Or nobody noticed. Or it did not matter. Or I do not know what.The second half of the book takes a more political turn and one that mirrors the author\u2019s own interests and concerns about property ownership (see http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/l...)They are visited by Mr Price, a rich local landowner. He turns out to own the land on which Daniel\u2019s father had built his house, although the land had been formally owned by Daniel\u2019s mother who first inherited it but then sold it to Price when she had financial problems. Price also turns out to have had a fancy for Daniel\u2019s mother before she eloped with Daniel\u2019s father, who at the time worked for Price as both a prize-fighter and also a hired enforcer.Price is not treated sympathetically in Daniel\u2019s account:Mr Price was the sort of man who accelerated his car when pedestrians crossed the road.[... He] had a few cars but drove his blue Peugeot saloon when visiting tenants. The ones who paid in cash. The rest did informal work for him on his land or elsewhere. They paid their rents through this work. He preferred it that way. That way he did not have to organise wages and they were his to run like dogs. For the most part he had inherited the land he owned.[...]Daddy said that Mr Price just hated to feel the weight of helplessness. To interfere with the lives of others was to carve for himself a presence in the world. Mr Price detested that which he could not control. We lived here on his doorstep yet he had no access to our lives. We did not pay him rent, we did not work for him, we did not owe him any favours. And so he feared us. The family start to become involved in the local community, seeking information on the exploitation of both local tenants and also the casual workers by the local landowners, led by Price:There was little to be had around here. The jobs had gone twenty years ago or more. There was just a couple of warehouses where you could get work shifting boxes into vans. At Christmas-time there were more boxes and more vans but still not enough. There were jobs here and there for women: hairdressing jobs, nannying jobs, shop-assistant jobs, cleaning jobs, teaching-assistant jobs if you had an education. But if you were a man and you wanted odd jobs or seasonal farm work this was where you met.The workers tell them how they labour for illegally low wages, while claiming benefits. Indeed the only good thing said about Price is that he will at least give you time off to report to the job centre, except:\u2018He\u2019ll go and dob you in if you cause a fuss. He\u2019ll go and tell job centre you\u2019ve been working for him and he\u2019ll rustle up some bits of paper he says he\u2019s been giving you all along. Payslips and legal stuff. Stuff you\u2019ve never seen before in your life but then it\u2019s suddenly there and it\u2019s your own fault for claiming benefits and for not paying tax or summat, all in one go. Happened to Johnno.\u2019 \u2018Happened to Tony.\u2019 \u2018Happened to Chris, and all.\u2019 \u2018Bastard.\u2019 Similarly the locals complain that their landlords collect the rent but, unlike the council for their tenants, provide no services such as repairs to the property: It\u2019s land. Only land. I\u2019m paying to live on a piece of land that we, all of us, used to own together. And I\u2019m working as hard as I ruddy can to get enough money to pay for that land that we, all of us, used to own together. And I can\u2019t see reason for any of it, any more.\u2019They, together with a local called Ewart, start to lead an orchestrated fightback, by collectively withdrawing their labour and withholding their rent, appealing to the times when the workers had strength and power through withdrawing their rent. Although Vivien slightly punctures their pomposity:I saw that Vivien had been standing with us. She looked at Ewart uncertainly. I was not sure if they knew each other but before I made to introduce them, she spoke. \u2018It wasn\u2019t all that wonderful, all the time. Those men who would come together so naturally to support one another would go home drunk and beat their wives.\u2019 Ewart was caught for a moment. Vivien continued, \u2018There are dreams, Ewart, and there are memories. And there are memories of dreams.\u2019But following initial success, Price and his men fightback, literally, and the struggle ends in a violent and bloody (and to be frank, rather over the top) conclusion, causing Daniel to flee his house and then desperately try to find his sister, walking along the train line to Edinburgh. This story of his search is told not at the end, but rather in brief interspersed chapters.Elmet is certainly a very strong debut novel and the Booker jury are to be credited with having bought in to our attention \u2013 it\u2019s certainly much stronger and more distinctive that many of the surprise inclusion in previous year\u2019s lists.However it is not without a number of flaws. Daniel is not a completely convincing creation: the lyrical prose of his narration doesn\u2019t sit well with his blunt verbal speech and his character is rather exaggeratedly na\u00efve (one remark We had driven all the way to Leeds for them.  rather called up Harry Enfield\u2019s blunt-Yorkshire-bloke in my mind (\u2018Don\u2019t talk to me about sophistication \u2013 I\u2019ve been to Leeds\u2019 \u2013 see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56NjX...). And the Vivien Daniel relationship felt underexplored.The political aspects of the novel also felt rather unbalanced. Mozley addresses some legitimate concerns, but does so by creating a rather cartoonish protagonist in Price \u2013 buy-to-let landlords aren\u2019t all that evil (honest!).3.5 stars \u2013 rounded down to 3 for now but I will see how I feel on reflection. But certainly recommended and longlistworthy, albeit not at the expense of The Gallows Pole."}, {"userName": "Trudie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4617856-trudie", "userReview": "Finally getting to the last of the books I had an interest in reading from the 2017 Booker shortlist.  Elmet  generally referred to as the out of left field contender, the book written by the second youngest author to be nominated, typed out on her phone on her commute to work (look what you can achieve when not idly playing Words with Friends).It's perhaps too easy to be dismissive of this novel, particularly when much of the discussion focuses on what book should have replaced it on the shortlist. Taken on it's own merits I think this is a strong debut, their are some beautiful passages. Mozley is a convincing writer of landscape, I have never read a book with so many references to copses and coppicing. I also liked the depiction of life off the grid, there is a great bare-knuckle fight scene, bonfires, much making of things from wood. Aside from a few nods to the modern this is a book that could easily be referring to events in a village of say, the early 19th century. At times reading this was akin to watching a potentially good film with very bad actors struggling mightily with accents. The seemingly random switches into \"owt\" and \"nowt\" were discombobulating, but more problematically, I struggled to read Daniel as a believable boy. Mozley is playing a lot with gender expectations in this novel and it is one of the things I really liked about the book. While Cathy gets some great scenes, rolling her own tobacco and fighting boys, Daniel is our guide and narrator and unfortunately I don't think the author really nailed his voice in a way that worked for me.Probably the single deciding factor that tipped this book towards a three rather than a four star read, was the excessively detailed descriptions especially when seemingly apropos of nothing.  After ten minutes of driving Martha reached over and gripped my left hand. Her palm was hot. I felt the steady pulse in her thumb and a warm band of gold on her ring finger. Her firm fingernails were set in acrylic.  This is ok, when first encountered but pages of this level of detail about very simple actions frankly frustrated me.Lastly, the ending, to keep with the film analogy the last few pages could have been guest edited by Quentin Tarantino. It was almost humorous if it also wasn't so blatantly violent and rather hastily played out. The villains in this book on the whole were pretty two-dimensional and of the arch nemesis variety, a little more nuance here, some depth to these characters would have elevated this book enormously.It might seem like I have spent plenty of time pointing out what didn't work about  Elmet  but actually taken as a whole I think there is probably more to admire in this than I have given credit for certainly Mozley is an author to watch in the future."}, {"userName": "Pavle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13916633-pavle", "userReview": "Vrlo, vrlo, vrlo dobar debi.

Daniel is heading north. He is looking for someone. The simplicity of his early life with Daddy and Cathy has turned sour and fearful. They lived apart in the house that Daddy built for them with his bare hands. They foraged and hunted. When they were younger, Daniel and Cathy had gone to school. But they were not like the other children then, and they were even less like them now. Sometimes Daddy disappeared, and would return with a rage in his eyes. But when he was at home he was at peace. He told them that the little copse in Elmet was theirs alone. But that wasn't true. Local men, greedy and watchful, began to circle like vultures. All the while, the terrible violence in Daddy grew.Atmospheric and unsettling, Elmet is a lyrical commentary on contemporary society and one family's precarious place in it, as well as an exploration of how deep the bond between father and child can go.", "title": "Elmet", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35711376-elmet", "average": 3.84, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1500560183l/35711376.jpg", "reviews": 918, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17037495.Fiona_Mozley", "name": "Fiona Mozley"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35711376-elmet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36254681-elmet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36276653-elmet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35834470-elmet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39723579-elmet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36312822-elmet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36436938-elmet"]}
