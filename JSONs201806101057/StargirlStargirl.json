Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli is a young adult classic (maybe even a children's classic but that's really a cataloguing issue that I am ill-equipped to discuss). This designation raises the question: What makes a book (any book) a classic? For me it means a book that is timeless; something you can read years and years after it was written without the book losing its vibrancy. A classic also needs to have memorable writing and characters. It needs to speak to the reader. It needs to be a book that you enjoy more every time you read it or talk about it. Classics are the books you want to immerse yourself in: the books you wish you could live in with the characters that you wish were your friends.I'll say it again: Stargirl is a classic.The story starts with Leo Borlock, who moved to Mica, Arizona at the age of twelve. Around the time of his move, Leo decided to start collecting porcupine neckties--no easy task, especially in Mica. For two years, Leo's collection stood at one tie. Until his fourteenth birthday when an unknown someone presented Leo with his second tie, someone who was watching from the sidelines.Mica's unusual events don't stop there. The story continues when Leo is a junior in high school. On the first day the name on everyone's lips is Stargirl. Formerly home-schooled, Stargirl is a sophomore like no one Leo (or any of the other Mica students) has ever met before:\"She was elusive. She was today. She was tomorrow. She was the faintest scent of a cactus flower, the flitting shadow of an elf owl. We did not know what to make of her. In our minds we tried to pin her to corkboard like a butterfly, but the pin merely went through and away she flew.\"After finishing this book and recently reading Love, Stargirl (Spinelli's newly released sequel), I have my own explanation: Stargirl is magical. She represents the kind of magic more people need in their lives: to appreciate the little things, to dare to be different, to be kind to strangers. The kind of magic where you still believe things can be wondrous.In the story, Leo soon realizes that Stargirl might be someone he could love.Unfortunately, high school students don't always believe in (or appreciate) magic like Stargirl's. As the school moves from fascination to adoration and, finally, to disdain Leo finds himself in an impossible position: forced to choose between the girl he loves and his entire lifestyle. Technically speaking I love everything about this book: the characters, the story, the cover art. This one has the full package. Spinelli's writing throughout the story is perfect. He captures Leo's fascination with Stargirl as well as his equivocation as he is forced to choose between Stargirl and \"the crowd.\"Stargirl is not a long book. The writing is cogent, sentences brief. Nonetheless, the text is rich. This book never gets old or boring. Spinelli creates a compelling, utterly new narrative here (with a charmingly memorable heroine).You can find this review and more on my blog Miss Print"}, {"userName": "Zo\u00eb", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9303625-zo", "userReview": "I read this in middle school as required reading and absolutely LOVED it, but coming back to it years later, I couldn't help but notice some of its flaws. I got very attached to the story despite it being less than 200 pages and I do love the moral that Spinelli is trying to get across, but I was not a big fan of the characters. Although, with a book this short, exaggerated characters are pretty much a necessity. I recommend this book to everyone, though, especially middle schoolers who feel the need to conform."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/355071-karen", "userReview": "Very sweet. I had this book lying around and picked it up to give myself a break from the Holocaust Monster I've been chipping away at for the past month, and it definitely did the trick. The kids seem a little innocent - more like elementary school than high school - but dammit why CAN'T there be beautiful and magical teenagers who hold hands at the movies and give their friends cupcakes and valentines?

She is everything every school girl wishes she could be but will never dare to be. She does the last thing someone who wants to fit in will ever do.\u2022\tShe smiles at everyone.\u2022\tShe dances in the rain.\u2022\tShe wears the strangest outfit and wears no makeup. (Not anything like that. I\u2019m exaggerating. Lol.)\u2022\tShe sings every celebrant a happy birthday with her ukulele. With a personality like hers, how do you think will she survive high school or better yet, life? Or an even better question is, how will anyone who has known her will survive with or without her? Read the book to find out.^^What I like most about this book is the simplicity and sincerity of the story including the narrative method as the story is told by Leo (the adult version) who had a firsthand experience of Stargirl\u2019s free-spirited nature when they were teenagers. The tone of the narrative voice is a blend of both happiness and sadness because the narrator, despite his feelings for Stargirl, was too affected by what other people thought of him and opted to go for majority. But even though he lost that one girl he will never forget, she has carved a permanent mark in the man\u2019s heart.   \u201c\"Who are you if you lose your favorite person? Can you lose your favorite person without losing yourself?\"   I like how the story eased its way through the end without having to go through dramatic complications and yet still managing to achieve completeness in its theme and plot. It is a non-imposing moralistic story and a very uplifting short read that I'm sure will find a way to spark that starlight in every reader's heartRecommended to middle-schoolers, teenagers, children, readers who feel young at heart, adults and oh well, everyone!^^"}, {"userName": "Jared", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541654-jared", "userReview": "Stargirl is an amazing book about individuality and nonconformism. A home-schooled girl named Stargirl begins attending the public high school for her sophomore year. Stargirl is different.She learns everybody's birthdays and on the day of, she sings them a happy birthday song -- accompanying herself on the ukulele -- in the middle of the lunch room, whether they want her to or not. She watches a young boy who lives across the street so that she can create a scrapbook for him without his knowledge. She is, in almost every way, unconventional.The voice of the book is a young man who becomes fascinated by Stargirl and befriends her, even though many of her antics make her an outcast, otherwise. Through a series of events, she becomes wildly popular, then widely despised. For this boy, she experiments with being conventional for awhile.The book is fascinating. It explores a lot of issues centered around social conventions and how they play in our lives for good or ill. And they take place at a stage of life when kids are most susceptible to peer pressure. Jerry Spinelli's insights are thought-provoking and engaging. In the end, the book makes you want to be a better person, perhaps in ways that aren't quite \"normal.\" It reminds me of a talk  given by Dallin H. Oaks, in which he said, \"... This requires us to make some changes from our family culture, our ethnic culture, or our national culture. We must change all elements of our behavior that are in conflict with gospel commandments, covenants, and culture.\" The genius of it is that the book does this without being particularly preachy.In its philosophy, and to a lesser extent in its style, the book has strong similarities to Bridge to Terabithia."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/990663-michael", "userReview": "For some weird reason I couldn't put this book down!

It ended with a necktie. But not just any kind of necktie and not just any kind of girl would give someone a gift with pictures of porcupines. I really loved this book. REALLY! I did. I HEART Stargirl. Seriously. I\u2019d been meaning to read it for years and like the last book I devoured, after reading the first 2 pages, I couldn\u2019t put it down; so the other books I\u2019d started before this one got pushed aside so I could get lost in her world. This book had me completely mesmerized.My favorite line: \u201cWe discovered the color of each other\u2019s eyes.\u201d (Chapter 9)Actually, there were lots of lines I loved in that book but that line in that moment when people are starting to take notice and embrace their individuality stands out the most for me.Of course, my heart broke for Leo. Thirty years later, he still thinks of Stargirl (the girl with many names, by the way); he still wakes up to her laughter (\u201c\u2026a second sunrise to his day.\u201d) I know a lot of people would say this book was too preachy, this book was too unbelievable, this book was too sappy, etc. but I LOVED it so much that I\u2019m thinking of skipping the sequel. I nearly ordered it online last night but part of me wonders if I want to abandon this feeling I have of knowing and loving Stargirl exactly the way she is. Does there really need to be a sequel? Do I need to know more than I already do about these characters? I don\u2019t. And so, I am moving on with a full heart.

I expected a heavily handed tale about acceptance. But here's the thing: I did not like Star Girl. The story is about a free-spirited girl whose named herself Star Girl who shows up for her first year of public education as a sophomore and the typical apathetic student body doesn't quite know how to respond to her. Normally when I read stories about the quirky outcast, I want to shield them from cruelty of the popular crowd, but I found myself sympathizing with students at a loss of how to interpret this strange girl. When Hillari told Star Girl that she ruined everything, I concurred. And when Star Girl equated being normal with the most popular girl in school I sighed heavily at how little she understood the workings of high school friendship. It never was about blending in and finding common ground with her. She wasn't happy unless she was blazing her own trail without consciousness of who she plowed through in the process.Having too much personal experience with people who don't understand social cues or possess the mental valve to filter, I know what it's like to be embarrassed by people on social thin ice. I didn't find Star Girl a rare charming bird that should be bottled unaltered. I found her disrespectful and obnoxious. OK, her goodwill was charming, but interrupting a football game to climb the goal post or showing up at a funeral and interfering with the grieving is not. Being different is one thing, but interfering with other's choice to follow social guidelines is just as unaccepting as those who shun anyone who doesn't follow the crowd. There has to be a balance between keeping your individuality and allowing other's to chose theirs, as well as respecting the social proprieties that make people feel comfortable. I found myself siding with the crowd and I know had I met a girl like that in high school I would have rolled my eyes at her theatrics and ignored her too refusing to allow her to always be the center of attention. I was not sad for her but angry at her for what she did to Leo. To just assume he would make a decision and not give him the means to make amends. This girl created her own drama. I have a feeling the author intended readers to be charmed by Star Girl and experience her social roller coaster on her emotional level, but I didn't. I experienced it from the conforming crowd.

I liked the message it had about nonconformity and kindness and being yourself and selflessness, but I didn't like Stargirl. I don't know if it's allowed to say I didn't like her, but I didn't. I respect her and admire her, but there's such a thing as being too thoughtful and kind--as in, disregarding someone's feelings--which really makes it thoughtless and not nice at all. Like, the idea of singing to people on their birthdays during lunch. It's a nice idea, but what about people who are painfully shy, or even just regularly shy? I don't think the author's right that we all like some validation and attention--I think if I'd been faced with someone serenading me in the lunchroom in high school I would have either skipped school or skipped lunch, because I would have been beyond mortified. It would have made me sick. I hate attention. But she would have done it anyway. That's what I mean, and I guess that's what bothered me the most about her. I think the goal to be outward-oriented, as in looking beyond ourselves, is very good and something we should all strive for, but I didn't like that she didn't take into consideration people's feelings. There are lots of ways to make people feel validated and special--or to feel that their sorrow is shared, their successes are celebrated, etc.--less flashy ways, but they didn't seem to be a default for her. Also, she was too good, too careless of people's opinions, too saint like, too selfless; I guess to me she felt too perfect, not real. She never felt like she could be a real person, someone I could actually meet one day. Too larger than life. Anyway. I guess I've got to give the book props for making me react so strongly; I certainly didn't come away from it feeling \"eh.\""}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10697179-mel", "userReview": "Edit: dropped to 2 stars So I originally DNF'd this book at 75% and gave it a 2 star rating.

You're supposed to see how shitty these people treat Stargirl and realize that you can't bully others for being different. But the thing is, I don't think that comes across well in this book. Because the POV is one of the idiots, you just get the sense that it's okay to judge and hate this girl because she's different.

Maniac Magee was my favorite book when I was a kid, and it remains my favorite preteen chapter book to this day. But Stargirl didn't move me the way that first taste of Jerry Spinelli's work did. In fact, I was so underwhelmed that I had little interest in finishing the book, but it was a fast enough read, so I stuck with it.The execution itself isn't bad. The character of Stargirl could easily have become a paper doll, one of those (usually female) characters who is so untouchable, so up-in-the-clouds perfect that she lacks any sort of dimension and can't be taken seriously. So, I'll give Spinelli that much--he conveys Stargirl's sincerity well. Additionally, she's deep. She has actual reasons for behaving the way she does, and they're actual, complex reasons that involve intelligence and creativity. I appreciated that she got enough floor time to actually explain her reasons for doing things, rather than just being a mysterious saint. Ultimately, though, Stargirl's earnestness can't disguise that she's just another Manic Pixie Dream Girl.I have to remind myself that most readers of this book will be young enough that they haven't been beaten to death with this tired trope in hundreds of romantic comedy/tragicomedy/dramedy-themed books and movies. Boy--who is nice enough, but a little inhibited, a little in need of some inspiration--meets outrageous, free-spirited, earthy girl who changes his life forever by teaching him to stop caring what other people think and be silly and really live, man. I swear, I thought to myself at the very beginning of the book, \"Any minute now, she'll be outside dancing in the rain,\" and then five pages later, she was outside dancing in the rain. Some of Stargirl's actions made me uncomfortable, too. I know she's supposed to be the shining, free-spirited light among all the dull, uninspired conformists in the high school drone factory, but just because she has good intentions behind her actions doesn't mean they are all necessarily good ideas. Stargirl goes to a lot of trouble to reach out to people, and she does it without asking for any kind of thanks, but having someone sing \"Happy Birthday\" to you in the middle of a crowded room or broadcasting your love for someone without talking to them first has always struck me as somewhat inconsiderate. Some people just don't want that kind of attention, and nothing is more traumatic for them than having all eyes in the room on them, completely without their consent. It's true that Stargirl is portrayed as completely innocent, and it's highly possible that she lacks the necessary social filters to understand why being serenaded with \"Happy Birthday\" isn't always a desired gift, but it made me less sympathetic toward her. It kind of reminded me of those guys who propose to their girlfriends on the Jumbotron at a sporting event--it's arrogant to assume that everyone else wants exactly what you want, and ultimately, regardless of your intentions, it makes the gesture about you, not the other person (while all eyes are on that person, obligating them to behave gracefully even if they're going to pieces inside). A more succinct way to summarize the last two paragraphs is this: the Stargirl character is inspiring but not original, and the heavy-handed message of Everyone Needs to Lighten Up and Be More Appreciative of Each Other is well-intentioned but shortsighted.Otherwise, the story was all right. Stargirl might lack social filters, but Leo behaves like a complete ass to her, resulting in the story's somewhat bitter ending. I think this was a fairly realistic portrayal--he cares too much about the approval of the many to show support for the one. And I did appreciate the story's lack of a sugary, upbeat ending in the name of resolution. I like a protagonist with regrets. Leo doesn't seem to have changed much--for all his obsessing over Stargirl after she leaves, one gets the impression that if he got a second chance, he would still care more about fitting in with the crowd than about treating her well--but at least he gets to spend the rest of his life wondering about the one he pushed away. (Even that falls into the MPDG, too-good-for-this-dull-world cliche. Of COURSE he has regret. She's gone, so she'll always be exactly as she was at sixteen and he can idolize her and righteously lament how perfect she was and how stupid he was.) But Stargirl doesn't deserve the shitty way everyone has treated her, and she is probably at her most realistically human when she changes herself out of desire for Leo's acceptance. Likewise, Leo is at his most realistically human when he embraces the \"new\" Stargirl, then rejects her when she stops conforming. The journey to maturity sucks.I'm probably taking this all way too seriously. The book was ok; I wasn't as wowed by it as most reviewers seem to have been; I should probably lighten up. But I've given my opinion."}, {"userName": "Talia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66700-talia", "userReview": "Stargirl Caraway is the new girl at Mica Area High School, and in her mysterious first days of school, she reveals herself to be a true unique individual. She plays a ukalele! She carries around a pet rat! She gives little gifts and cards to people she doesn't know! Soon, all of the high school cannot resist her charm, and she has the entire community under her spell. But after a while, Stargirl's actions become tiresome, irritating, and the question rises among her peers: why can't she just be normal? Soon, Stargirl is ostracized for all of the wonderful things that make her special. Will Stargirl recover and ever be loved for just being herself?I loved this book. I cried at the end of the book, partly because the ending was so touching and partly because the story itself was over. I loved Stargirl's character and child-like innocence, I loved the romance between her and narrator Leo, I loved the book on CD read by John Ritter. I haven't been this happy about a book in a long time!One small note: in high school oratorical contests, the speaker sends in their speech to a committee ahead of time, and cannot deviate from that written speech at the time of delivery."}, {"userName": "Heba", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68150924-heba", "userReview": "\u2764...\u062d\u0642\u0627\u064b\u064b \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0623\u062d\u0628\u0628\u062a\u0643 \u064a\u0627 \"\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u064a\u0631\u0644\" \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0638\u0646 \u0625\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0643 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062e\u0648\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u0648\u062a\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0644\u0643\u0649 \u064a\u0631\u0636\u0649 \u0639\u0646\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643 \u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 ..\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u0641\u062d\u0633\u0628 \u0648\u062e\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0645\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0639 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0643 \u0648 \u062a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0637\u064a\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0645\u064f\u062d\u0628\u0627\u064b \u064a\u0633\u0639\u0649 \u062f\u0648\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0625\u062f\u062e\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0642\u0644\u0648\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0646.."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/314550-anna", "userReview": "This was my first Jerry Spinelli read and for the most part I enjoyed it. I'd give it 3.5 stars if that was possible. :) I can see why kids like his writing style, which is simple and straightforward, yet interesting. The issues he tackles in this book -- identity, conformity/nonconformity, and peer pressure -- are all relevant for middle school-aged readers, which is who this book is best suited for. Also, I think he does a good job of sending the \"right\" message without being preachy.At the same time, though, I wasn't totally invested in the characters. I kind of felt like Stargirl was a bit too \"out there\" and sometimes though it was difficult to garner sympathy for a character that was so totally clueless. Well intentioned, yes, but at times too much of a fantasy. I also felt somewhat torn in my feelings towards the narrator. On the one hand, I thought he was very \"normal\" and his reactions were what I think mine would have been. At certain times, though, he seemed too spineless and and emotionally detached. I suppose, though, he probably was representative of most 16-year-old boys. All in all, I liked the book a lot but felt as though I would've liked something that was a bit more grounded and less abstract. I found myself comparing this to the much darker The Chocolate War and the themes are quite similar but I found that book to be much more realistic. For more mature readers, I would recommend that instead."}, {"userName": "Chelsea (chelseadolling reads)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16219087-chelsea-chelseadolling-reads", "userReview": "Wow.

She's the type of girl that you either love or hate--with no room for any emotions in between. When she first comes to the high-school as a sophomore in small town Mica, Arizona, her name reverberates throughout the hallways. What kind of a name is Stargirl? Was she really home-schooled for all these years, or did she just magically appear in Mica? How can she seem so calm, so serene, why eating quietly alone in the lunchroom, then strumming her ukulele as if all alone? The boys in school are immediately struck by her quiet, unassuming beauty. The girls are both jealous of her innate naturalness and excited to have her enthusiasm in the school. For Leo Borlock, it's a mixture of fear and excitement that has him falling in love with the mysterious Stargirl--and a desire to see her on the Hot Seat, the in-school television show he runs with his best friend, Kevin. The kids at school embrace Stargirl--her quirkiness, her individuality, her enthusiasm and exuberance for everything she does. She discovers friends and cheerleading, and she's popular. Popular, that is, until she starts rooting for the opposition, determined to bring joy and happiness to everyone, not just her home team. Suddenly, she's not the popular girl that everyone wants to be around. The same individuality that was once embraced is now snubbed, literally, by almost everyone in school. Except for Leo, who's in love with the enigmatic Stargirl, a girl who whole-heartedly loves him back. Until Leo is forced to choose between the affections of an entire school full of classmates and the maybe-too-individual Stargirl. When faced with the choice of one person versus many, Leo might not be strong enough to make the right decision. Jerry Spinelli has penned a book that goes straight to the heart of wanting to fit in, of sometimes being too good to believe, of life and love and heartbreak and the desire to be different, yet the same as everyone else. STARGIRL is a pure delight, and you won't be able to help being drawn into this very believable story, and it's truly unbelievable characters."}, {"userName": "Maddie (Heart Full Of Books)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18523225-maddie-heart-full-of-books", "userReview": "This was like reading a John Green book, before John Green books existed.

This should be the standard for all young adult books. It\u2019s realistic, inspiring and I bet that it\u2019s a story everyone could relate to. Plus, there\u2019s no sex scenes, and just one decent kiss. The book, is narrated by Leo Borlock\u2019s perspective. He gives us an idea on how different Stargirl could be in a normal person\u2019s point of view. Stargirl, being homeschooled, decides to come out of her shell. She enrolls at Mica High, and fortunately fails to blend in. For odd reasons, such as singing someone she barely knows a happy birthday, she stands out. Her schoolmates couldn\u2019t help but find her odd. One time, Stargirl goes to a football match, which no one almost ever watches. She makes an exhibition of herself, by roaming around the football field (I imagine her like a fairy), until police had to come forward just for her to leave the field. That\u2019s when Mica High attended every game onwards. Stargirl was a sight to watch. She was also recruited to the cheering squad. And again, she gives the readers another dose of her weirdness, by cheering enthusiastically, for everyone (that includes the other team). For others, we might find this hateful (just imagine your cheerleader cheering for the other team), but this proves the depths and lengths of Stargirl's na\u00efvety and pure-heartedness. It\u2019s actually amazing. Leo, is and always has been amazed by Stargirl. The feeling was mutual, and they become a couple. Leo enjoyed being with Stargirl. He was at peace, but then he noticed that the entire Mica High was shunning him as well. Leo Tolstoy was definitely no island, so he turned sad. He needed Stargirl, but he needed his peers as well. How Stargirl ever manages it, was a wonder to him. And Leo makes a choice. A terrible choice.And Stargirl, makes a terrible choice as well. She decides to be \u201dnormal\u201d.All of us are either Stargirls or were Stargirls. Everyone is a star. We are stars, some in little ways, and some in ways that no one can possibly miss them. But the thing is, we have what it takes to be a star. The problem is, how do we deal with the stars lodging in us. Some polishes their star to make it brighter, while some hide in the brightness of other stars to suppress their shine.After I finished this book, I was left with the same thought as Leo\u2019s:\nIs she there? I wonder what she calls herself now. I wonder if she\u2019s lost her freckles. I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get another chance. I wonder, but I don\u2019t despair. Though I have no family of my own, I do not feel alone. I know that I am being watched. The echo of her laughter is the second sunrise I awaken to each day, and at night I feel it is more than the stars looking down on me.\nAnd I have to say, we have to make Stargirls the new normal."},

book. It is one of those YA books that are relevant and replete with life lessons for all to learn, whether you can relate to the characters or not. \n\nStargirl\n\n is told in the first-person point of view of Leo Borlock, a junior at Mica High School in Arizona, who crosses paths with a beautiful, kind, and weird girl who has re-christened herself as, well, Stargirl. Stargirl Caraway draws attention to herself from day one by acting and doing things that are out of the ordinary: she plays the ukulele and sings \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to her classmates-celebrators in the cafeteria, right in front of everyone; she covers her desk on three sides with a floral curtain in all of her classes, and puts a flower on a shallow vase on top, too; she dances in the rain; she cheers for the opposing team when they score, and; she dresses in odd clothes. Simply put, she was different from everybody else, and she doesn't care. Notwithstanding such non-conformity, Leo finds himself drawn to Stargirl, as did everyone else \u2013 in the beginning. But a series of events makes these very same people turn against Stargirl, and Leo, as well, by association, whom everyone began calling \u201cMr. Stargirl\u201d. Thus, Leo inadvertently comes at a crossroads, and must decide whose opinion matters more to him: Stargirl's, or everyone else's. More than the fact that it was an easy read, \nStargirl\n is a lovely book about belonging and acceptance, one that delves into the pitfalls of highschool popularity. Reading about how much Stargirl strived so hard to be normal \u2013 to belong, to be just like everybody else \u2013 wrenched my heart, especially since she did it not of her own volition, and because in her attempts to be normal, she shed her own identity and became a completely different person. After reading the book, I realized that it begged the question: How important is it, really, to be normal and popular in school? Is popularity a requirement among teenagers/highschool kids before you could belong?Although from my own experience, I did not find myself in either Leo's or Stargirl's situation when I was their age, I felt like I could completely relate to them. I could feel how much Leo was torn between his feelings for Stargirl and his sense of belonging with the rest of the school. I could understand the lengths to which Stargirl went to please Leo; I could perceive her happy moments, disappointments and heartaches. Their realness leaped out at me from the pages, it was that good a book. To end this short review (if it can be called that), I will leave you with this particular line that tugged at my heartstrings, from a dialogue by Archie Brubaker, Leo's aged paleontologist friend who collected bones, fossils and similar stuff: \u201c... [E]very once in a while someone comes along who is a little more primitive than the rest of us, as little closer to our beginnings, a little more in touch with the stuff we're made of.\u201dAlso posted here."}, {"userName": "Beth A.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/889182-beth-a", "userReview": "I guess my problem with this story was that I really didn\u2019t buy Stargirl. She\u2019s so self-confident/oblivious that she doesn\u2019t seem to notice or care that the whole school is giving her the silent treatment. She\u2019s extremely kind and compassionate. She meditates, wears floor length dresses and carries a rat around in a sunflower bag. She\u2019s the perfect model of a nonconforming individual. I wanted her to have some flaws. To be secretly worried about being accepted before Leo explained that it\u2019s important. To be nervous before going on the \u201cHot Seat\u201d. To cry, or scream, or yell unspecified swear words when she was hit in the face with a tomato. I would have had more respect and admiration for Stargirl if she was an individual in spite of understanding social norms- rather than because she wasn\u2019t aware of them. I didn\u2019t like Leo much either, although his behavior was more realistic, because when you love someone, you stick up for them, you stick with them, even when it\u2019s tough."}, {"userName": "Chanelle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1286875-chanelle", "userReview": "This was a fun read and I found many parts of myself in it. I was once different (but never to the extreme that Stargirl was ;) ), but have conformed from years of ridicule and being the blunt of jokes. It has only been very recently that I've been trying to gain some of that older self back and I am grateful for this book at this time. I can and will be true to myself and not let others influence what I find important and interesting! Some fun side notes~ I'm from Tucson and could understand running through the desert, dancing with the saguaros and barrel cactus. I've actually done it :) I've hiked to the top of peaks and sang Native American songs out over the desert. I even had many enchanted places that I would take boyfriends to. My nickname in high school was Mockingbird because I knew all the birds and their songs and would call to them (sometimes they would call back!) I think it is time to find those moments again. I was so much more in tune with who I was."}], "description": "A celebration of nonconformity; a tense, emotional tale about the fleeting, cruel nature of popularity--and the thrill and inspiration of first love.
