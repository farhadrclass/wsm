This meant he had to return to his Amish roots and raise them within the Amish community in Middle Grove, Pennsylvania. Years earlier, Caleb had left the Amish way of life to attend community college and chase his dreams. He works hard on his farm and enjoys life with his niece and nephew and seldom thinks about his life outside of the Amish community. When tragedy strikes, and he makes the decision to have his nephew airlifted to a hospital for medical care, he is thrust back into urban life. At the same time, he faces disapproval from his father, Asa, for placing the injured boy on a helicopter.Dr. Reese Powell is working at the hospital when Caleb's nephew Jonah is brought in. Her parents are successful doctors and hope that one day she will join their medical dynasty. She is intrigued to see someone from the Amish community in the hospital. She answers his questions tries her best to make him comfortable. When the danger appears to be over for his nephew, Caleb finds that he is also intrigued by Reese and enjoys answering her many questions. Coming from two different backgrounds, they form a friendship. Reese does not know much about the Amish way of life and as Caleb educates her, the reader is educated as well. Reese also gets to meet Caleb's niece, Hannah, who is hiding a secret.Two different worlds collide in this book and I enjoyed reading about the Amish community. This book dealt with issues such as abuse, shunning, physical rehabilitation, acceptance, following your dreams and your heart. Her characters are faced with cultural/religious issues such as respecting someone's wishes against receiving medical treatment when it goes against his/her beliefs. The reader also witnesses what can occur when someone does something that goes against their community's rules. As in her other books, Wiggs stresses the importance of family and friendship. She also addresses what it means to have a duty to your community, keeping your word, and observing traditions.I enjoy Susan Wiggs books. Her characters feel as if they are real life people and are faced with real situations. Her books are well written and prove to be fast reads for me. I enjoy books that not only entertain me but educated me. This book did both. Wiggs books are also light on the romance. There are no graphic sex scenes or language. You know if her characters have sex, but she doesn't go into much detail. I know some enjoy her lighter touch to romance.Overall, an enjoyable read!I received a copy of this book from Edelweiss and William Morrow in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Charlotte", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50429708-charlotte", "userReview": "This is a GoodReads giveaway win.This book is just beautiful and inspirational and sad. Caleb lives in a small, strict Amish community in Middle Grove. He lives with his father, Hannah, his niece and Jonah, his nephew. The author often has Caleb tell about some great tragedy in the first several chapters and that keep me reading. Asa, Caleb's father was abusive. Caleb's mom left when him and his brother, John where very young. His brother and sister-in-law died, which is why Hannah and Jonah live with him and what brought him back to the Amish. Caleb left the Amish and never intended to return. That is this basics, but so much more unravels as you read this story.The author weaves a story of an abuse father using his devote faith to cover his actions. Somehow that terrible man ended up with someone like Caleb who seems to give up everything he's ever wanted to make sure his brother's dying wish is fulfilled. Then bring in a young girl who feels guilt and shame over something that could and has happened to many. A refusal to ride a helicopter even to save a young boy's life because it goes against the religion. A doctor who just steps in whenever need. This book is a wonderful story and is beautifully written. It tells some of the clashes between Amish and English societies. It has a good plotline a great ending."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44411316-bonnie", "userReview": "Reese Powell is a gifted fourth year medical student on duty in her rotation through ER.

It was just what I needed. I so loved the niece and nephew and my heart just ached for them. I only had to knock it down a point because I just felt that ending was rushed. I guess I just wished it was a couple hundred pages longer. I sometimes think authors just start a wonderful book and they follow where the story takes them, then they look at the page count and go, \"Oh shite! I gotta cut this short!!!\" That is exactly what I felt with this novel. I don't mind long books, so I wouldn't have put me off to see a book was 500 pages long, but I understand others might pass it over. However, I've always enjoyed Susan Wiggs books, so I should hope that her other fans would support her.Of course that's just my ramblings and it might not have anything to do with how Wiggs felt. Maybe she didn't cut it short in her mind, but damn, I just feel that so much was left out at the end.I would be thrilled if this became a little series...would love to read more about the children and some of the other characters in this novel. I already hate that I have to leave them behind and find a new book to read. Do you hear me, Susan Wiggs? If there had been another book I would jump straight into it. I would be reading it now right now instead of writing this review!

I have many.Good story about Amish and English and how their worlds combine. Caleb is caring for his niece and nephew after their parents were murdered. His brother requests they be brought up 'plain'. Caleb was wanting to stay in the English world, but did as his brother requested.Caleb's nephew has a horrific accident and is taken to a hospital to save his life. Enter lovely woman doctor (Reese) who helps care for the nephew and finds Caleb a place to stay while the nephew is recovering. Yes, they start a relationship. Reese is choosing where she wants to go in her medical career, and her choice is not what her parents want for her. She wins.Fast forward and Caleb and Reese meet back up. And you'll have to read it yourself to find out what happens.I could do without all the \"bad\" words that start with F. I think the author used them to show the difference between Amish and English, but it was a little overkill for me personally. I never want to read or hear that word. Otherwise it's a very good book.

There is Caleb, an Amish uncle caring for his brothers children and Reece, a dedicated doctor struggles with where she whats to go with her career. They meet when Caleb's nephew has a devastating accident and is brought into the hospital where Reece is working. The story explores the struggles these two must over come to be together, with the biggest challenge being Caleb's duty to his brother's children and their faith.
