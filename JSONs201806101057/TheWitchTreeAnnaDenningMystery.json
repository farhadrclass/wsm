I'm one of those people that usually stay clear of anything having to do with witches. But because it was advertised as an Edgy Christian Mystery, I decided to give it a chance, and I'm so glad I did. \"Days before Christmas in Elk Park, Colorado, genealogist Anna Denning discovers a client's body. When she starts asking questions no one wants answered, she becomes the killer's next target. Still grieving the death of her husband, Anna must draw on her wounded faith to enter a world of wicca and paganism \u2014 reminders of a past she buried long ago \u2014 and discover the secret of The Witch Tree.\"I loved Kaufman's clear writing voice. It really bothers me when the writing gets in the way of the story. That's my biggest pet peeve - as both a writer and an avid reader. Only a talented writer can make scenery descriptions add flavor to a book, and make you want to grab your coat and a cup of hot chocolate as you read about how cold a December in Elk Park, Colorado can be! Her characters were very believable and life-like, and I loved Anna's character most. Ever wish for the perfect words to say in a confrontational situation? Anna truly has a gift for her witty comebacks, and I love that she refuses to be intimidated or back down from a fight. Jazmin has made friends with the wrong people, desperate to belong and feel acceptance. You can't help but feel for her, and think of all the teens that are drawn to \"Harry Potter\" and and the like.The references to witchcraft are informative but not unnecessarily detailed. I liked the way Kaufman made fun of it all, showing that without intimidation and scare tactics, witchcraft doesn't have a leg to stand on. There were a few \"d***\" and \"h***\" words thrown in there, and I'm guessing that's the reason it was labeled \"edgy\". It didn't bother me. If you're a geneology buff, a dog-lover, or prefer the romance element subtle, you're going to like this book. I give it five stars. Karin Kaufman has done a superb job wit her debut novel, and I look forward to reading more of her books in the future."}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3618657-darlene", "userReview": "Having no knowledge or interest in Wicca or paganism, \"The Witch Tree\" would not be a typical book I would pick up.

A genealogist determined to find the truth. Just days before Christmas in the mountain town of Elk Park, Colorado, genealogist Anna Denning discovers a client\u2019s body. When she starts asking questions no one wants answered, she becomes the killer\u2019s next target. Still grieving the death of her husband, Anna must draw on her wounded faith to enter a world of wicca and witchcraft\u2014reminders of a past she buried long ago\u2014and discover the secret of The Witch Tree.This is my first read from author, Karin Kaufman. It is the first book in the Anna Denning Mystery series. The title alone may be somewhat off putting for Christian readers, but this book is written from a Christian worldview and is a faith-based cozy mystery. This book is a great series debut book that focuses on the theme that light will always overcome darkness. There were several things I particularly like about this book. First the sleuth, Anna Denning, is a professional genealogist; and I am an avid genealogist. Second, I loved the small town feel of Elk Park Colorado as it was just up the mountain from where I live in Loveland Co which is mentioned in the book along with neighboring Fort Collins. It was easy to picture this small town nestled in the mountains. Third, I found it interesting to learn a few things about Wicca as this New Age movement has attracted many young people who have become disillusioned with their parents' faith. Anna was a strong heroine and was willing to fight for what she felt was right against the evil that was pervading her town. As she grew stronger in her faith, she fought even harder against the darkness that Darlene was spreading throughout the town. I loved the slowly developing relationship between her and Gene as he supported her in this battle. Jazmin and Rowan well represented the many lost young people in today's world. Darlene, of course, was the epitome of evil. A great book to curl up with for a quick, easy, and interesting read. I look forward to reading the other books in this series.FAVORITE QUOTES: \"And Wicca was a great pretender, a pretty, enchanting \"path.\" But as she had learned over the years, the fairest blooms bore the darkest poisons.\"\"She'd invited evil into her life, and evil always answered.\"\"The whole street was bathed in white light, as though God were wiping away the darkness, saying, Start again. My mercies are new. 'God is good.' \"Most of the time we can only see it in retrospect. Our Lord can be maddeningly subtle......Sometimes he's not subtle at all, He's a bull in a china shop.\""}, {"userName": "Krisi Keley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3994950-krisi-keley", "userReview": "Karin Kaufman\u2019s suspenseful mystery, The Witch Tree, is, hands down, one of my favorite novels this year for a host of reasons, not the least of these being the outstanding writing.The story opens with genealogist Anna Denning finding the body of one of her clients, to whose home she has gone in order to deliver a copy of her family tree. It\u2019s apparent the woman has been murdered, and when the victim\u2019s husband finds Anna in his house, he is convinced she\u2019s the perpetrator of the crime. From there, the tension mounts, as Anna discovers that it was not the victim who requested her own family tree, but the owner of a new age occult store called \u2018What Ye Will.\u2019 The danger grows more deadly still when Anna\u2019s research into why this self-proclaimed witch secretly employed her services makes her the woman\u2019s number one enemy.Author Karin Kaufman has crafted a fascinating mystery-suspense around the modern phenomenon of neo-paganism in The Witch Tree, her well-researched story dispelling some common myths about the \u201chistorical\u201d roots of Wicca and its relationship to true witchcraft. However, though this theme is an essential aspect of the story, it is not the only one, and the author leaves it to the reader to make his or her own decision on the validity of neo-pagan claims. Just as vital to the story are the universal themes of love and loss and the human tendency to seek escape from a painful past \u2013 which can lead to the search for new gods or to an injured faith in the personal love of the more traditional one. All of the well-drawn characters in this novel are real people \u2013 from protagonist Anna Denning, still struggling with the grief of losing her husband only a few years into their marriage to the embittered antagonist who searches for self-identity in all the wrong places. This isn\u2019t a book filled with good and evil stereotypes, but with human beings making choices as they struggle with very real challenges in life. The novel\u2019s spirituality is a subtle one \u2013 there for those who believe a story lacks without it, as a person\u2019s worldview is fundamental to his or her character, but not thrust on those who are only looking for an exciting mystery. For this reason, I found The Witch Tree to be simply a marvelously-written story that offered all the things I like best in a novel \u2013 tightly-woven plot, believable and sympathetic characters, terrific suspense and beautiful writing. I eagerly look forward to reading more works by this talented author."}, {"userName": "Amanda Stephan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3570959-amanda-stephan", "userReview": "If you picked this book up for a heartwarming Christmas tale filled with sugar cookies and little elves, you're not going to get it. What you are going to get, is a great book filled with action, suspense, and a tinge of romance. Follow along and sit on the edge of your seat as spunky Anna Denning is unceremoniously swept away into the mystery of The Witch Tree. It was supposed to be a simple job. Research Susan Muncy's family tree. But only the female lineage. Deliver it personally and get paid. What she didn't bargain for was being the first to happen upon a dead body. That of Susan Muncy herself. The action fast and enjoyable, the writing easy to follow, and the plot just right, Karin Kaufman is a force to be reckoned with. If this is her debut novel, watch out all you cozy mystery lovers, you're going to have a new favorite. My advice to you readers? Make sure you have a whole day to read set aside as you will not want to put it down. My advice for Ms. Kaufman?

The characters were stereotypes. The murderer was pretty obvious by his/her second scene. No real investigation takes place. The entire story was about attempts by the antagonist to intimidate and harass the protagonist, Anna.And then there was a conversation between Darlene, a witch and pagan, and Anna, a Christian. Darlene refers to a celebration of the \"spring solstice\". Anna corrects her and insists on the word \"Easter\". This is pretty obnoxious.

Denning is a character I rooted for throughout, as she deals with her own personal struggles while trying to get to the bottom of a murder.

I felt the magic story line was forced and was not as interesting as it could have been.Something else that would get under my skin was how slow the story was to build, and the way we got so many filler scenes.

Anna Denning, the main character, is a professional genealogist who comes upon a murder victim while delivering genealogical research results. Against her will, she gets swept up into a mystery involving apparent attacks on her by the husband of the murder victim and members of a local coven. At first she seems to just want the attacks on her to stop, but then she decides that everything is connected to the murder and goes about trying to solve it.Anna is an endearing character. Shs has faults, including a tendency to speak and act before thinking through all of the possible consequences.My major quibble with the novel was that many of the pagan characters were presented in a very stereotypical way rather than realistically. Anna seems to regard most pagans as inherently evil. At one point, Anna states that she is actually proud of being judgemental regarding pagan practices. Given the actions directed against her, Anna's feelings are understandable, and I admired her courage in standing up against evil when she recognized it. However, some of the pagan practices depicted in the book represent a caricature rather than actual typical practice. Anna did take the time to get to know one of the pagan characters better. I believe the genuine caring interactions Anna had with this character would generally be more effective than loud rantings against religious beliefs that are sincerely held by others.The novel is very well written. The denouement was perhaps a tad predictable given what was presented earlier in the book, but some surprises remained to be revealed at the end. I listened to the audio version so I can't really say it was a page-turner, but it was very hard to put down the media player when it was time to stop listening! Narrator Becky Doughty provided exactly the right amount of dramatization to add suspense to the story without distracting from the narrative. Her style was very simple and her speech clear, with no unusual character voices or strange sound effects.I will definitely be moving on to the next book in this series to see what Anna Denham encounters next!"}, {"userName": "Tracy Krauss", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3911366-tracy-krauss", "userReview": "The Witch Tree by Karin Kaufman is a Christian novel about a woman who unwittingly gets involved with a group of modern day witches and must protect her reputation and ultimately, her life. Anna Denning makes her living as a genealogist, researching other people\u2019s family trees. When she shows up at a client\u2019s house with her findings, she discovers the woman dead. Thus begins a tale that takes us into the minds and hearts of modern day witches, wiccans, druids and covens.

She soon finds herself in the witch\u2019s \u2018bad books\u2019 as she tries to keep her good name intact and find out who really killed Sarah Muncy. I enjoyed the book for its mystery and the complexity of the tale. There was a lot of information about modern day occultish practices, which was interesting but not really up my alley. It was obvious that the author did her homework, though, so those that are interested in that topic will be pleased. As a Christian novel, it did not come across as preachy. Anna is a woman of faith, but she doesn\u2019t try to convert everyone. Sometimes she seemed a bit headstrong \u2013 even foolish \u2013 in the way she jumped into the fray, but since this is a series, it is probably a character trait we will see in future instalments.

The book starts with the main character stumbling upon a dead body as she personally delivers a family tree that has been commissioned on behalf of the victim.So far so good on the mystery part, but if you are looking for an investigation into the murder, you can skip right to the end (or set the book aside) as there is not much of one and there is no real mystery as to who killed the victim.On the other hand, if you are looking for a somewhat spooky thriller involving \"witches\" (in quotation marks as there is no flashy magic involved), then you may very well be satisfied with this novel as the story line is much more about Anna Denning's unwanted fight against the local top witch and her coven than about the investigation into the murder.As for the Christian element to the book, I can't say that I found it to be that prevalent or much of an issue. Yes, it is a Christian community and the witch/wicca characters are alienated/ridiculed a little by the other residents, but as with anything that pertains to religion, the reader just has to take this in stride and let it be part of the story setting."}, {"userName": "Susan Snodgrass", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7103516-susan-snodgrass", "userReview": "This book was recommended to me by an author of Christian fiction mysteries and since her books are so good, I decided to read it.

Determined to get her own way no matter who she has to hurt, and delighted to use politics (office or otherwise) to maintain her position.
