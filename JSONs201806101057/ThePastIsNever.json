They were not allowed to swim there since it was known to be cursed. Their father always told them that it was evil, the devil's place. Bert and Willet wander off and when they come back, Pansy has disappeared. Not drowned, not lost... simply gone. Pansy is only 6 years old. They keep looking and hunting for her. They looked years for her. They were Pansy's brother and sister. Their mother died of a broken heart. They never gave up. Clues come to them, leading them to the remote tip of the Florida Everglades.They think this might be the answer to Pansy's mysterious disappearance. But truth like the past is better left alone where it lies. The Past is Never is a compelling addition to Southern Gothic fiction. I just love this genre. It deftly weaves together local legends, magical realism, and the search for Pansy. It is an atmospheric haunting story of myths, legends and the good and evil we carry in our hearts. I just loved the atmosphere of this read. It is also dark. This book was so different than I usually read, and it was really needed at the time. Some parts were really intense and heart breaking. All the characters were very well done. I loved Bert and Willet. There mother made me so mad, because she didn't take responsibility for anything. You could really tell that she loved Pansy, the best. She always favored her more. I also loved Clementine. I really felt sorry for Bert and Willet, since they had so much guilt. Their mother just made them feel worse. I loved the writing style, and I loved the ending. It was so touching. It was beautifully written. I didn't know what to think of it in the beginning, but it got a lot better and turned out to be an excellent read.This was a Traveling Sister read and it was a really fun discussion.I want to thank Edelweiss, the publisher and Tiffany Quay Tyson for the copy of this book, in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Southern Gothic takes us to the Mississippi Delta and a quarry said to be evil, cursed. Three siblings told to give a berth to this quarry, instead it becomes a place they regularly go to swim. Something horrible happened here in the past, bug the past is never, it is carried inside the person or inside a place that has seen the evil of man. Something terrible happens on this the three siblings last day, and changes their lives forevermore.Fantastic characters, all terribly flawed as the most interesting characters often are the easiest in which to connect for the reader. Dark, atmospheric, descriptive, the story of what happened at the quarry years ago, and what happened at the quarry now. Some evil events can mark a person, leave its mark on a specific place. Two siblings will head out to the Everglades trying to solve the mysteries at the heart of their family. We make the connections within their family as we follow along. Totally drawn into this one. Loved the way it was written and the dark tone used to such great effect. The closest comparison I can make between this book and others is with the author John Hart. Though this one is a bit more centered, tightly plotted. A wonderful sisters read where we all found it great.

I read Tiffany Quay Tyson\u2019s debut, Three Rivers, and adored it. It was a simple book with beautiful writing and a story of family. I was thrilled when I saw she had a new book coming out. Once again, Tyson focused on family. Three siblings, Bert, Willett, and Pansy go swimming at the forbidden local rock quarry, and one of them disappears. It\u2019s a story of good and evil, the past and the present, and haunting myths and curses. The Mississippi Delta made for the perfect southern atmospheric setting, just as it did in Three Rivers. I had a rough start with this book, but I\u2019m so glad I stuck it out. After the first third, I was entranced with the characters. Overall, this book was a magical reading experience!

After I read the first few of pages, I thought maybe this was going to be a little too eerie, a little too dark, a little too suspenseful, a little out of my comfort zone. I continued reading and a few pages later I knew that I would not be able to abandon this writing. This writing that was full of emotion and beautifully descriptive. I couldn\u2019t leave it without finding out what happened that day when Bert and Willet take their younger sister Pansy to the quarry, where the water was cool on this hot day, where they weren\u2019t supposed to go. Something happens that changes their lives and several years later Bert wonders what she would have been like, what life would have been like if things had been different. She is on a journey to discover the truth. The book description gives a lot more details so I\u2019m not going to do that here for fear of spoilers. There\u2019s evil in that quarry, and there\u2019s prejudice in the Mississippi delta, and there\u2019s sadness and heartbreaking losses . The prejudice is more powerful than the legends or beliefs in the curses. It\u2019s a story of family and maybe fate. The first person narrative by Bert alternates with stories of the past . The stories that depict the legendary belief of the evil of the quarry, going back in time to the slaves who dug it. The stories go back in time to the children\u2019s grandmother, Clementine\u2019s past and the children she took in. One of them was the children\u2019s father. I loved this going back in time because it eased the suspense of the present time for me a bit. The writing is phenomenal, the characters especially Bert and Clem are so well drawn.

Pansy is the youngest, the favorite and is spoiled rotten. Their mom treats her like royalty and when he\u2019s around (which isn\u2019t often), their dad dotes on her. They live in a place that is full of legends and is said to be cursed. Unexplainable things have happened in this place. Bad things. Is it legend, the curse, or do bad things happen to bad people? The days are hot and humid and the only place to cool off is the quarry - and it\u2019s forbidden. Yet Bert and Willet can\u2019t resist and they always take Pansy along. While swimming in the quarry, they only leave her alone for a second and neither worry as Pansy is the strongest swimmer of the three. A second is all it takes. When Bert returns, Pansy is gone - she just disappeared into thin air and as the years go by, there is no sign of her. The tragedy tears the family apart, yet Bert and Willet don\u2019t give up and will do whatever it takes to find their sister. This novel is atmospheric, dark and eerie. It also has a beautiful, exciting and mysterious feeling to it, once that honestly I can\u2019t describe. \u201cThe Past is Never\u201d surprised me.

Told from the point of view of Bert (Roberta Lynn), she\u2019s fourteen years old when she and her sixteen-year-old brother Willet go in search of berries, leaving their six-year-old sister Pansy swimming in the quarry. Pansy is the strongest swimmer of them all, and, even though their father has told them the quarry is cursed, it\u2019s a brutally hot summer day, who wouldn\u2019t want the relief of cool water to swim in?Willet and Bert get separated in the woods, but when they return to the quarry, their sister is gone. Divers, police, and the entire town search for her, but as time passes, it seems she\u2019s simply disappeared.This is surprisingly a surprising gripping page-turner for a literary novel. The characters are likeable, especially Grandma Clem, who helps women with their pregnancies, even if that means helping place a child they can\u2019t care for into the hands of a couple who can\u2019t have children of their own. Also, helping woman who have been raped. Somehow, the powerless women in the face of men who deceive and hurt them isn\u2019t depressing. I\u2019m not quite sure how the author pulled that off.Bert\u2019s father disappeared frequently before Pansy vanished, but it used to be for weeks at a time, not years. When Pansy goes missing, so does he. Willet is convinced their father knows something about where their sister is. Bert can\u2019t let the past go. She believes her father and her sister are still alive. She goes in search of answers, and her journey is a compelling one.Highly recommend.

Throw in the musicians\u2026 Muddy Waters, Elvis Presley, Conway Twitty, Tammy Wynette, BB King, John Lee Hooker. It\u2019s a long list. Then there\u2019s the architecture, the bottle trees, and yes, the food. Food so good it takes your mind off the sweltering heat and humidity. And then there\u2019s the voodoo, the signs, the superstitions that abound here, all add an aura that is its own charm.August of 1976 was hotter than most, the kind of sweltering heat that leaves your skin sticky with sweat, and sleep elusive. Willet was the oldest at sixteen, Roberta Lynn, who was called \u2018Bert\u2019 by everyone but her mother, was fourteen and Pansy, the youngest, was only six, but it was clear to everyone that she was the favourite. The quarry wasn\u2019t far from their home, a place that almost everyone referred to as \u201ccursed.\u201d Legends abounded about the quarry, how it was made, what lay at its bottom. Secrets best kept hidden. A place their father had always warned them about, calling it evil and saying that \u201dThe Devil will find you there.\u201d They\u2019d heard all the stories about this place, but it offered the only respite from the heat that was available to them. And so, they head there not for the first time on this August day, with Pansy\u2019s first day of school, first grade, starting soon, and their father away on business. Pansy floats serenely on her back in the deep water, while Willet swings off ropes with wild splashes until hunger hits, and he grabs Bert and takes her with him to pick some brambleberries, telling Pansy they\u2019d be right back. By the time Bert returns, Pansy is gone. They now have to confront a life of not knowing, absolutely, what became of Pansy. Their life lived outside the margins already flawed, begins to show signs of, cracking, crumbling underneath the pressure. Southern gothic literature is typically a bit gloomy, strange, and always atmospheric. This has all of those elements, plus a very compelling story, a dash of tension and a sense of mystery that slowly unravels. A new author for me, but I understand she has a debut novel which I missed, which gives me something new, to me, to look forward to reading.

This tale brought together many characters chief among them were: Bert, Willet, and Pansy. The children, as well as their parents, were attracted to an old rock quarry where legends, folktales, and Gothic fiction seem to abide. The children in an attempt to cool off on a hot Mississippi summer's day head off to the woods and then to the quarry which contains a pool of collected water. They have been warned to stay away, this quarry is the devil's ground, but they decide much like children always seem to do, that what is forbidden makes for an attractive, irresistible lure. And so they go and by day's end, Pansy is missing, when Willet and Bert wander away while Pansy is swimming in the collected water.What ensues is the search for Pansy and as the story is portrayed the children's family both now and in the past is told. Their father has disappeared a while back and the two remaining siblings, police, and volunteers search for Pansy. Where could she have gone? How can someone disappear without a trace?Years go by but the guilt never leaves as both Willet and Bert continue to believe in their hearts that Pansy is alive. They grow, lose their mother to a broken heart and eventually wind up in Florida in the Everglades searching yet for the lost sister. The Past Is Never is a true Gothic tale. It has all the elements which make it a scary yet realistic read, one that provides the reader with much in the way of secrets, myths, ad legends. It is also a story of family and the love that is often given by those not related by blood but by the human bond of acceptance and love. \"We must take care of our families wherever we find them.\" (Elizabeth Gilbert) The finding of family and being family is the ultimate goal of who we are.

The book is a dark journey of the soul that illuminates into a blessed ending.The missing child, Pansy, is the youngest of three children in a rural Mississippi family. The father is a gadfly, never at home, leaving the children in the care of their overworked momma. One day, Pansy, her brother Willet, and our narrator, Bert, venture out to play in a nearby cursed quarry\u2014a place their father has warned them to stay away from. A place haunted by stories of meanness and southern hate. Willet and Bert leave Pansy at the swimming hole while they go off to pick wild berries. When they return, their sister is nowhere to be found. With father and child both missing, the children\u2019s mother drops into a deep depression. Weeks turn into years of despair. The family\u2019s hope that Pansy may be found and the father may return never comes true. The family deteriorates, frozen in the stasis of waiting. It is a Christian story. It is a story of surviving the weight of expectation. Eventually momma dies, her family swallowed inside its own poverty and suffering. Tyson writes it with aching beauty, so that the reader feels how circumstance can actually eat people alive. Particularly Bert\u2014a girl who should be blossoming, but who seems to be wilting into oblivion. Until Willet convinces her they must leave on a search for their wayward father. Somehow his abandoning the family must hold the secret to Pansy\u2019s disappearance. And so with few clues and mixture of hope and desperation, the two set off for Florida. The Past is Never is a beautiful elegy that never sits at any one plot point too long. It holds elements of Southern folklore and Faulkner in a single sentence. It tells important lessons about how the suppression of women is the suppression of civilization itself, and how suppression never prevents progress, but only delays it. The circumstance may not change. The poverty may last. But from these swamps beauty emerges. The southern landscape is a place that teems with life. All manner of it. That\u2019s how The Past is Never reads. Like a bounty of detailed fullness, told with disturbing beauty."}, {"userName": "Talk Supe", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5773665-talk-supe", "userReview": "I have a thing for motives and endings when it comes to plot drivers.

It doesn\u2019t have to be a storybook one, just something that would not only give closure to Willet & Bert, but something that would give them comfort that all their pain and misery were for some higher purpose and not just another story about worthless parents who didn\u2019t deserve to have kids like Willet & Bert."}, {"userName": "Ken Lutes", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18649902-ken-lutes", "userReview": "Dark secrets of the past lurk in the deep recesses of the mind, like the no longer wanted things some people of White Forest, Mississippi, discard into the waters of an old rock quarry.

Willet takes whatever jobs he can find and Bert works with their Granny Clem. By the early eighties, they are old enough to follow a few leads to Florida where they hope to find answers about their missing family members.Interspersed with the events unfolding in the present are chapters detailing the tragic history of the quarry. How these stories fit into the mystery of Pansy's disappearance does not become clear until late in the novel. These chapters are interesting but without context, they are a little confusing.The Past Is Never by Tiffany Quay Tyson is a somewhat gloomy and slow paced novel. The characters are well defined and the legends about the quarry are somewhat mystical and quite eerie. The novel comes to satisfying but somewhat bittersweet conclusion."}], "description": "A compelling addition to contemporary Southern Gothic fiction, deftly weaving together local legends, magical realism, and the search for a missing child.Siblings Bert, Willet, and Pansy know better than to go swimming at the old rock quarry. According to their father, it's the devil's place, a place that's been cursed and forgotten. But Mississippi Delta summer days are scorching hot and they can't resist cooling off in the dark, bottomless water. Until the day six-year-old Pansy disappears. Not drowned, not lost . . . simply gone.After years with no sign, no hope of ever finding Pansy alive, Bert and Willet have tried to move on. But as surely as their mother died of a broken heart, they can't let go. So when clues surface drawing them to the remote tip of Florida, they drop everything and drive south. Deep in the murky depths of the Florida Everglades they may find the answer to Pansy's mysterious disappearance . . . but truth, like the past, is sometimes better left where it lies.Perfect for fans of Flannery O'Connor and Dorothy Allison, The Past Is Never is an atmospheric, haunting story of myths, legends, and the good and evil we carry in our hearts.", "title": "The Past Is Never", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35883106-the-past-is-never", "average": 4.3, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1505930440l/35883106.jpg", "reviews": 22, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8475688.Tiffany_Quay_Tyson", "name": "Tiffany Quay Tyson"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Gothic", "Fiction", "Gothic", "Horror"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35883106-the-past-is-never", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36644392-the-past-is-never", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23014718-three-rivers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193858-the-cuckoo-s-calling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
