There is no mention of them in the creation stories of Genesis, he says, because their existence could become a distraction. The intense brightness of their pure knowledge can blind mortal beings to the divine. Knausgaard is aware of this danger and hints at the risk he's taking at the beginning of A Time for Everything when he says, \"...darkness isn't the danger, light is. That is where all the pitfalls are to be found.\"Nevertheless, Aquinas says, angels are messengers from the divine and deserve due attention. In particular, their assumption of material form is instructive in itself because it is a demonstration of the possibility of the infusion of the material by the spiritual. For Aquinas this demonstration becomes definitive in the Incarnation of the God-man Christ.This may all sound biblical. But it's not. It's largely Greek philosophy which begins by positing the immutability, the un-changeability of the divine as one of its primary characteristics. Knausgaard, in the guise of his fictional theologian Bellori, dumps this Greek presumption of divine stability by taking the bible somewhat more literally than even many evangelicals might like. \"It is not the divine,\" Bellori claims in his On The Nature of Angels, \"which is immutable and the human which is changeable, he wrote, the opposite is true and is the real theme of the Bible: the alteration of the divine from the creation to the death of Christ.\"What Knausgaard is exploring is therefore not the influence of God on man through the heavenly envoys but the opposite. Man's experience is so alien to God that it has to be communicated gradually to him, beginning with the conversion of the angels. These are the pitfalls he means. Angels \"regard us with total apathy,\" he says. They don't have a clue about who and what we really are. They have to learn. And so does God:\"The fact that the Lord's feelings towards mankind alternated between sorrow and despair and a fury so great that it could cause him to destroy whole cities means that the expectations he had of them, which they could never live up to, were inhuman - that is, divine. He never saw man in his own right, never for what he was, only what he ought to be. ...he never understood them. And how could He? God was far too large for man, their lives too small...\"This becomes even clearer in the exegetical discussion about the prophet Ezekiel: \"Before Ezekiel, the Lord's applications to mankind had always taken place outside them; the boundary between the Lord and the chosen one was absolute. With Ezekiel this boundary was crossed for the first time.\" God was learning, and consequently changing, turning more man-like: \"Does not Ezekiel describe God as a 'form in human likeness'?\"But man too was developing. He was becoming 'divinised' (an explicit doctrine of the Eastern Church), that is, he too was becoming capable of change. He was fighting his way back past the mighty Cherubim guarding the gates of paradise, and back into the divine presence.Ultimately this provides a very different view of salvation than Greek philosophy. Becoming divine is indeed a liberation but not into a nirvana of eternal stasis. Rather it is salvation into a world of continuous development: \"Nothing is ever finished, everything just goes on and on, there are no boundaries, not even between the living and the dead, even that zone is quivering and unclear.\"I admit that the first time I read A Time for Everything I just didn't get it. I therefore apologise, probably to myself, for not allowing myself to be drawn into his alternative theology of change, to be, that is, just a little bit divinised."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"This is an extraordinary tale, and the angels' role in it is not easy to grasp. Traditionally, angels are the link between the divine and the human, at once messengers and the message itself... The angels are action and meaning in one.\"-- A Time for Everything, Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd\u201cConcourse of Angels\u201d, by J. Kirk RichardsIt really is impossible for me to say how many different ways I loved this novel. It wasn't perfect, certainly. It was messy, and uneven in parts, but it was also strange, strong, addictive and compelling. It was powerful and gentle. It felt like a strange combination of The Red Tent and Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire with hints of Knausg\u00e5rd's later fictionalized memoirs (My Struggle) thrown into the Coda.Primarily, this novel is a frame story that allows Knausg\u00e5rd to discuss his fictional 16th-century theologian and philosopher Antinous Bellori, who started writing about angels after an experience in his youth with a couple fallen messengers. The story unfolds as Knausg\u00e5rd discusses Bellori's Opus 'The Nature of Angels'. This giant work contains an exegesis on all the angels of the Bible. For this book, Knausg\u00e5rd focuses on four major episodes in the Bible that each, at some level, involve angels:1. Cain and Abel2. Noah3. Lot and his family4. Ezekiel5. ChristIt is relevant to note here that this book is a bit of a head fake. The real thrust of this book isn't just angels. Certainly, it is hard to escape angels in this book, but it is just a reason for Knausg\u00e5rd to get into the weeds and retell these famous Biblical stories/myths using his gift for natural writing and human drama (there is a reason he is often described as the Norwegian Proust, besides his long, long, long books). For Knausg\u00e5rd, Angels represent a standard to measure our distance from God, or said better, to measure our changing distance from God. For me, the strongest parts of this novel were the stories of Cain and Abel and Noah and his family. Just those two parts were completely worth my entire time spent on this. They were beautifully rendered anti-myths. He took the simple stories as related in the Bible, and backed them out of the packaging of the last couple thousand years, and turns and twists each story (kinda how Mantel does with Oliver Cromwell in Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies. He presents them in a way that was earthy, humanistic, emotionally relevant, and where the miraculous was just as normal as the mundane, earthy, and everyday. Imagine a post Garden of Eden world that feels more like an agrarian, pre-industrial version of Norway/Sweden than the dusty, locust-filled deserts of Judea. With Knausg\u00e5rd, there is magic in the physical and modest. There is myth woven into in the material world of the everyday.I'm pretty sure this novel is one of those that will either floor you or bore you. It really depends on your background and patience. Having come from a religious tradition (Latter-day Saint) where material angels (Moroni, etc) play a real active part, this book was fascinating. But again, the novel isn't perfect, and I know I've probably still got some proximity buzz and bias going on, but my love for this novel is -- right now -- almost perfect."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee", "userReview": "Knausgaard's second book offers everything I fall for in a novel: authority, execution, audacity, oomph, heft. Other than a 75-page stretch midway where I worried this might have trouble maintaining the standard of excellence it had established, for ~425 nonconsecutive pages I was rapt, riveted, engaged, associating parts (the flood story, in general, is rising drama par excellence -- read 35 pages past bedtime one night to finish the section as the water rose) -- and I even ultimately gave the benefit of the doubt to that long stretch about Noah's sister that at first had comparatively seemed rushed and distracted/off the rails thanks to stuff really about the author's wife. But it recovered in retrospect -- by the end of the section it became clear that her love, her family, particularly the mundane daily tasks (cleaning), all gained significance knowing she and everyone with her would drown unless Noah took her aboard ye olde ark. Retroactive/spective change, with new sections changing perception of what preceded them, is a great strength and major theme of the novel. Loved following the author's lead through biblical stories repositioned in a mythic Norway straight outta Growth of the Soil. I don't have my copy of it on me (leant it to my mama) but would love to find the Hamsun line the following Knausgaard line reminds me of: \"the seed corn flows over his fingers when he dips his hand into the bag that hangs over his shoulder, with small, even flicks of his wrist it is sprinkled over the land as he walks across it, as if calling something to him all the time, as if this is some mysterious ritual, an exorcism, a prayer for a miracle, and see! a few weeks later it germinates and each cast of the hand can be read and judged.\" I'd suggest reading that one by Hamsun and the My Struggle series before taking this one on. Loved how he complexified the Cain and Abel story. \"The only things that have always been remembered are the story of the first people who were driven out of paradise and into the valley, the story of the two brothers Cain and Abel, and the story of the great flood. But all the details about these people and the world they lived in were gradually erased. And as each new age is convinced that it constitutes what is normal, that it represents the true condition of things, the people of the new age soon began to imagine the people of the previous one as an exact replica of themselves, in exactly the same setting. Thus Cain and Abel became nomadlike figures who lived and operated in a flat, burning hot, sand-filled world, of olive and fig trees, oases, camels, asses, robes, tents, and little whitewashed stone houses. Gone were all the pine trees, all the fjords and mountains, all the snow and rain, all the lynxes and bears, wolves and elk. In addition, all the infinitely delicate nuances in the relationship between the brothers were lost over time, such that only the bare details remained: Abel was good, Cain bad, Abel was a shepherd, Cain a tiller of the soil.\"Dramatizing the complexity of black/white archetypes is something really great lit does best -- I don't like to think about lit/art as something that \"serves society,\" that's functional or necessary or useful per se, but Complexity Emphasis is one of the arguments in lit's defense. A really slant autobiography of sorts that, stylistically at least, ends where My Struggle begins. Daddy issues herein represented via God/angels interactions with us human folk. The autobiographical parallels crop up in Cain or Noah or the narrator at the end. A story from My Struggle: Book Two: A Man in Love appears in fictional form: in My Struggle it's pregnant Linda pissed at Karl Ove for not telling his friend to slow his speedboat down, whereas in this it's Noah's pregnant sister pissed at her husband for not telling a driver of a carriage going over a rocky road to slow down. The narrator (not named Karl Ove in this) cuts himself up again with a glass shard as he does in My Struggle Vol 2. In a totally bold first-person coda that changes what you think about the preceding 450-something pages, there's a suggestion at the end that the narrator (author of the book you've been reading, not Knausgaard himself) is a prophet who might one day saw off his legs but there's no longer anything to prophesize these days, other than the pleasing benefits of noticing natural daily variation in the landscape (reminded me of the bit in My Struggle Vol 2 about how he only really cares about trees and water and sun). Really an enjoyable, \"rigorous\" read, in part because the publisher Archipelago created a beautiful paperback with French flaps and a cover image that synchs with a bit toward the end of the novel. Loved essayistic bits about how the art historical representation of angels changed over time along with their actual changing state. (Why do immortal angels change? Ahhh. Ya gotta read the book.) Not touched on in the novel, but it struck me that some of these angels, say the one Ezekiel encountered with wheels, could've been outerspace aliens. Not psyched that the angels' ultimate evolutionary destination was \"spoiled\" for me by a review on here -- I wish I could've experienced this clever little perception-shifting turn toward the end with fresh eyes. Now that I've read 1500 pages of Knausgaard I am officially calling for a translation of his first novel -- seriously, English-language publishers, how is it not available? Also interested to see how this compares with Thomas Mann's mega novel Joseph and His Brothers, up next for me, which also animates and humanizes a familiar bible story. Highly recommended for all semi-adventuresome readers fortified with a bit of interest in the early bible stories. Worth it for anyone who appreciates clear, flowing, steady, smart language, and who likes novels that make novels seem like infinitely open art forms."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "[It has become a clich\u00e9 to say that God is dead, and most people don't even stop to think about what that might mean. If you're an atheist, you'll say that He had it coming and good riddance; if you're a believer, you'll most likely echo Monty Python's Black Knight and explain that it's only a flesh wound. This novel has the courage to present the story in a realistic way. The light of the world has been taken from us. We are bereft.There are, of course, some serious technical problems to solve. If your point of view is the modern one, that is to say atheism, you can't really excite much pathos from the demise of a character who never existed in the first place; if you take the standpoint of conventional religion, you run the risk of sounding delusional. Knausg\u00e5rd has found a brilliant solution. The novel is set in a universe which unapologetically assumes Creationism, but it is such a weird, idiosyncratic version of Creationism that it's impossible to read it as anything but an artist's imaginings. The structure is complicated and odd, but it all fits together much better than one first thinks. The core of the book is two long episodes - essentially, novels within the novel - which are told straight; the first is the story of Cain and Abel, the second the story of the Flood. The Flood episode, recounted mostly from the point of view of Noah's sister Anna, is extremely powerful, and conveys better than anything I can remember reading the character of the jealous, wrathful God of the Old Testament, Who is loved but above all feared by His people. Wrapped around these narratives, which somehow manage to be both hyperrealistic and dreamlike at the same time, there is a long essay about the (fictitious) early Renaissance scholar Antinous Bellori, an expert on the vanished subject of angelology; and at the end, an unremittingly bleak segment set in modern Norway, which basically reads like a piece that has been lifted from Knausg\u00e5rd's later novel Min kamp.The theme which holds the book together is the angels. We cannot see God directly, but the angels intercede between Him and us. Since the assumption is that Creationism is literally true, Knausg\u00e5rd is unable to show Western culture's gradual acceptance of the fact that God does not exist. Instead, the story is told inside-out; Bellori's researches lead him to the conclusion that the nature of the angels, and hence of God Himself, is not eternal and unchanging. They, and He, are gradually weakening, becoming increasingly impotent and degenerate as they are bound to the Earth. The book tracks this progress, from the uncompromising Lord who drowns His people for their disobedience and rains fire and brimstone on Sodom, through the brutal and despairing but still noble angels that Bellori witnesses, up to the modern day, where the angels have altogether lost their nature and become nothing more than a particularly vulgar and rapacious species of bird.It's very well done. I tried to come up with other authors who have made similar attempts, and it's a short list. Doris Lessing's SF take in Shikasta is disappointing; Philip Pulman's YA version in His Dark Materials starts off well but loses its way somewhere in the second volume; James Blish's Black Easter would have been much better if he hadn't insisted on adding a sequel. But it seems to me that there is another author who's investigated this territory and succeeded. Tolkien's Middle Earth is an even more wonderful Creationist universe, and the Elves, the first Children of Il\u00favatar, cannot be anything but angels. Like Knausg\u00e5rd's angels, they are able to interbreed with humans; but their contact with the mortal world weakens them, and in the end they depart. Knausg\u00e5rd is known to be a great admirer of Tolkien, and in the final section I thought I heard echoes, not just of Arnold's Dover Beach, but also of Legolas's song:To the Sea, to the Sea! The white gulls are crying,The wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying.West, west away, the round sun is falling.Grey ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling,The voices of my people that have gone before me?I will leave, I will leave the woods that bore me;For our days are ending and our years failing.I will pass the wide waters lonely sailing.Long are the waves on the Last Shore falling,Sweet are the voices in the Lost Isle calling,In Eress\u00eba, in Elvenhome that no man can discover,Where the leaves fall not: land of my people for ever!

Knausgaard has called this his personal favorite of all he's written, and I can see why. This was his second novel, the first to be translated from Norwegian into English. Antinous Bellori, an eleven-year-old boy from a mountain village of 16th century Italy, becomes fascinated by an anthill he finds in the woods. He studies it, poking at it with a stick and watching the ants repair the damage, until, driven by an urge that he does not understand, he deliberately destroys it. Seeing what he has done, he is so filled with guilt and shame that he runs away in tears, until darkness falls and he is lost, far from home. Glimpsing a light glowing nearby, he hopes that it is a lantern carried by his father come to rescue him. Instead, the light leads him to two angels who are spear-fishing in the river. So begins Antinous Bellori\u2019s life work: an aggressive, individualistic pursuit of scholarly knowledge about angels and a relentless pursuit of the angels themselves \u2014 divine beings towards whom he harbors a strange mixture of longing and reverence for their imagined purity, and a cold desire to capture and perhaps kill one so that he can dissect it, document it, and cement his scholarly reputation. Bellori\u2019s thesis \u2014 that the nature of the divine has changed over time \u2014 becomes the frame-within-a frame for a series of imaginative retellings of stories involving angels from the Bible and other ancient scriptures, audacious speculation on theological and existential philosophical themes, and at the same time, an intimate meditation on being human. The close-to-life narrative plays out the theme of the book's title: there is a time, one moment, for every thing. But I'm not sure that means what it first seems to mean. Instead, it seems to mean something more radical: there is literally only one time, the present moment, which itself is ever-changing -- and changing much more radically than we imagine. While ostensibly angels are the connective tissue holding the book together, for me all the stories, human and angel, also speak in different ways of The Fall \u2014 of becoming mortal, human, inhabiting the brief time given to each of us \u2014 with all our failings and humiliations, but also our uniqueness and beauty. This slow and limited life, each in his or her own tiny footprint on earth, has such value that even the eternal angels want to partake in it. Well, for a while, anyway. After all, it\u2019s still life after the Fall. Some of these stories were so devastating that I had to put the book down for a while before continuing \u2014 especially the story of Cain and Abel, and the story of the Flood told from the point of view of Noah\u2019s sister \u2014 who does not make it into the Bible \u2014 or onto the Ark. In a creative but chilling riff on the biblical underdog-hero pattern, Noah is a sickly boy confined to his room, obsessed with science and philosophy, seemingly least fit to survive on earth. Does his lack of community with other human beings render him more capable of doing what he does? Maybe \u2014 yet he spends the rest of his life drunk to avoid thinking about the sister (and all the others) he left behind to drown. What a commentary on \u201csuccess\u201d in our world. Perhaps the crew of the good ship Stephen Hawking will have a similar experience if and when they leave Mother Earth for dead. Notably missing from this novel are the biblical stories of the angels that appear at the empty tomb of Jesus in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke to announce to the women that Jesus has risen from the dead. Instead, the novel\u2019s imaginative spin on contemporary European theology/philosophy incorporates Christ\u2019s death without any explicit reference to resurrection. (And I'm not really sure whether the intention is to completely omit the resurrection or to imply a very different understanding of the concept.) But the story of the resurrection is so different in nature and significance from the other biblical stories in its centrality to the Christian faith, I\u2019d love to ask Knausgaard whether he struggled over how to handle it, given that this book seems to be about (in part) where he perceives the currents of European history and thought over the past few centuries have led.The novel ends with a Coda that pulls the camera back to view the outer frame, the fictional contemporary narrator Henrik Vankel who has \u201crediscovered\u201d and become fascinated by Antinous Bellori. Yet this last chapter visits not Vankel\u2019s adult life as a writer, but the days of his youth. At the age of 18, after having done some terrible unnamed thing, Vankel has exiled himself to a tiny, nearly uninhabited island off the coast of Norway where he supports himself in a minimal way by cleaning the lighthouse, relives memories of his complex relationship with his father, and tries to come to terms with going on with life. Unexpectedly, he finds immersion in the concrete details of the everyday to be an agent of healing. I loved this section. Just as the older Vankel has noted that in each era we completely remake history, changing it to suit our current viewpoint, this final chapter seems to change everything that came before it."}, {"userName": "Ken", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken", "userReview": "As a fan of KOK's My Struggle series, I was a natural for this resuscitated effort from his early career. True to form, it stretches out to 500 pages, or about the length of Norway, north to south. Labeled a novel, it's really almost a collection of novellas under a poorly-framed conceit. Meaning? It's a sweet mess, but the sweet flavors the mess enough for 4 stars. See, it starts off in the 1600s with this youngster who stumbles upon two angels while traipsing through the woods. That, plus the Boticelli close-up of angels on the cover, tells you this is going to be a book about Angel Chasers.Not quite. After that brief episode, KOK moves into Biblical mode. Novella #1 is about Cain and Abel, as reimagined by a Norwegian with a rather Scandinavian setting. I liked it because the two bros were interesting and your sympathies went out to the bad boy loser, Cain (similar to Tim Rice's Jesus Christ Superstar, where your emotions are directed to another bad boy loser, Judas).From here we move to a Scandinavian (complete with fjords!)-based rendition of Noah and his ark. In truth, the focus is more on his sister, Anna, and the tough life in her family and her rural community to the point where you feel like you're reading an undiscovered Knut Hamsun (a treat!). Using the Anna POV allows KOK to score some points against OTG (read: Old Testament God) and even Noah who should have Noah-ed better in a critical scene during the flood.Those were the lion's share of the book, but there's extended narrative about Ezekiel (yawn) and even Jesus (passingly) before KOK realizes he was supposed to be writing about angels and comes back to our 1600s hero and his angelic quest. Trust me, these are not your father's Oldsmobiles angels, either. Very disappointing, to the point where, ridiculously enough, we wind up in Alfred Hitchcock's Birds mode (angels evolve, don't ya know).Interestingly, the book has a long \"Coda\" that looks like a warm-up for the My Struggle books. Our young hero (all new and out of the blue) is a young Karl Ove look-alike with a brother (like Karl) and a mean father (like Karl) and a certain talent for details (like Karl). That this coda has nothing--and I mean nothing--to do with angels is cool because, well, you've given up on that by now and, quite frankly, the \"My Struggle\" warm-up is more interesting than the fully-devolved Raphael and Michael and Gabriel and cherubim and what-not, anyway.See what I mean? Sweet. Messy. And don't worry about your guardian angel. By now he's seen everything."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/868037-josh", "userReview": "Wonderful narrative self-assuredness in this book, which, like some sort of gigantic airplane, takes a while to actually get off the ground but is practically unshakable once you're aloft. Knausgard's subtlety surprised me again and again: he keeps his thematic and structural innovations so hidden behind (or integrated into) his story that we barely even notice them. Paraphrased, this sounds annoyingly retrograde, but it's incredibly absorbing. The centerpiece, which centers around Noah and his family in the days leading up to the Flood, is particularly moving."}, {"userName": "Karmologyclinic", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3808180-karmologyclinic", "userReview": "\u03a7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c5\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd.It's been 20 days since I finished this book. And I've been thinking of it every single day. In a few occasions, it kept me awake at night, thinking. I can't pinpoint exactly why (my psychoanalyst would stare at me with a raised eyebrow here), but this book has affected me emotionally and intellectually. It has even got me to read the Bible piece from which the title is generated and that's something, as I've never touched the Bible before. And I've read this Bible piece 5 times now and, in case you don't know, I have not a spiritual cell in my body, but that Ecclesiastes 3 piece has a lot of meaning packed inside, meaning for the mortal, not the divine. And roughly, you can see that the whole Ecclesiastes 3 is an outline for Knausg\u00e5rd's novel.It refers to being human and being human has to do with time and time inevitable has to do with death. And in this journey there is a time for everything. From Cain (a time to kill) to Noah (a time to gather), to Noah's sister (a time to weep) etc. Knausg\u00e5rd has a unique story-telling ability. He can drag you inside his stories, he takes the Bible stories and re-imagines them, with a sincerity and literalism that theologians and believers won't. And it is this same sincerity (that I felt manifested in My Struggle) that makes it all worth it. You don't often see sincerity, be it in everyday life or literature. I mean gut-related sincerity, confessing your inner self, something unadorned and kept intact by a powerful superego. Most people would not destroy this facade (and that's a healthy thing to do), some will, Klaus Ove does it again and again in his books, he does it wilfully.The story is set on layers. There is the layer of the Bible stories, as reimagined by the fictitious Bellori, then there is the story of Bellori, as told by the so-called researcher of Bellori, Vankel, and then there is the author's alter ego, Vankel himself, at the Coda of this book. The stories also go from the external to the internal. You go from sympathizing with ostracized albino Noah's feelings to a painful Vankel first person breakdown. The Coda part of the story, the contemporary story of the alter ego Vankel, was heart wrenching to me. A man self exiled in an island after a breakdown. Maybe my mindset is more close to Knausg\u00e5rd than I'd like to admit (not a good thing). It also steeps in its blood, retroactively, what was narrated before it. Remember? Layers. The outer layer will stain the inner layers.The external part of the story is the history (and part treatise) of the divine in western philosophy. Leave it to Knausg\u00e5rd to make that emotional af. The internal part of the story is the existential anguish that the death of the divine has brought on Bellori/Vankel/humanity. And the personalized part of the story is devastating, a man really breaking down in front of you. I find this shocking and kind of pornographic, I think it's intended to be this way. Knausg\u00e5rd finds ways to tell a story that were never used before. Brilliant and honest. Confusing and straight forward. A book that inhibits a readers's mind for this long, deserves a raise from 4 (my initial rating) to 5 stars (what was I thinking...). You don't get many books in a year that can do that. For 2017 I can count 2 so far (besides A Time for Everything): Human Acts and The Association of Small BombsFun fact: I really went blank and without knowing anything beforehand into this book and for a big part of it, I thought that Bellori was not fictional but a fictionalized character that historically existed. That was fun."}, {"userName": "M.

His writing is quite sophisticated in its simplicity. He almost tricks you into reading on even when the body does not want to. He can tell a good story, and often digresses to a degree that is confounding to say the least. In his most recent books (in my case their being the first two volumes of My Struggle, particularly A Man in Love) he flat out wears me out with his hundred page accounting of changing a diaper. Or talking to the parents at a daycare meet-and-greet. Or how, in great detail, as an adolescent, he hid his beer. But this book made more sense to me for eventually reaching its end. In contrast to even his first book in the series, A Death in the Family, I never once asked myself what I might be doing instead with my valued time.To be forthcoming I confess to being an ex-communicated Lutheran. It is actually a badge of honor I wear defiantly, and at time perhaps, too loudly as well. But Grace Evangelical Lutheran Church in East tawas, Michigan deserves my wrath and my less-than-adequate vengeance that might rain down on its congregation. It is where I learned their version of every bible story I know. And it is where I did my public catechism and served as an altar boy for too many years to want to remember in detail. But what I learned upon graduating from high school in 1972, and taking off for parts unknown in search of my own forty acres and a mule, is failure to drink the wine or give the church money is grounds for one\u2019s dismissal from the church you had previously earned your way into through hard study and public demonstration of your belief and understanding of God\u2019s word. The relative public demonstration as well warrants an equal measure in the spirit of exacting revenge. But I have no hatred in the expression of my feelings regarding this transgression to me, instead I exact an untold level of joy in my every recurring advantage to further engage my attack. My coming to read this novel is in ways a bit absurd. The last thing I thought I would ever do would be to subject myself to more bible stories. But Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd more than subtly demanded I do just that. And I resisted for as long as I could. Then it took me a very long time to actually begin reading the book I had kept shelved in my library for at least two or three years. I was surprised when I guardedly began my reading. I actually liked what he was saying and the stories he told. I have no idea why he wrote the book, and I do not care. I like his voice. It draws me into whatever he is writing about.

Knausgaard is getting great acclaim and attention for My Struggle, and while I fully enjoyed the first two volumes of that, this one blows those out of the water, for me. I mean, as one who grew up religious and now couldn't be further from that, I never thought a book so centered on Biblical stories, on the nature of the divine and humanity, novelizing stories that are told in mere paragraphs in the Bible... This just didn't seem like something that would be up my alley, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The rigorous insight of the essayistic portions had me highlighting line after line, looking up paintings, reading various translations of the Bible... The expansion of the Biblical stories of Sodom & Gomorrah, Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, Ezekiel's prophecies, etc, they were so fascinating and came to some stunningly interesting and convincing conclusions. These iconic stories and characters are imagined as if they were a) true and real, and b) as if the people involved in them were real people, with real personalities, emotions, complicated lives, conflicts, etc etc etc. These brought a depth to the events that are merely described briefly in the Bible that I'd never really considered, and his deconstruction of the stories and what they mean seemed to me to be wholly unique, original, and fascinating. My jaw dropped over and over as Knausgaard brilliantly made me think and re-think stories that I'd heard over and over in childhood and adolescence. Stories which are usually used to convey very traditional morals and conclusions. This flips everything on its head. I want to get deeply religious people to read this in order to be able to discuss his take on these things... but, I fear they'll be offended or turned off by the less than traditional interpretations and conclusions drawn withinAnd when he finally tells us more about Bellori... and the Coda of the book. Who'd have thought I'd spend so much time thinking about Angels... ever?Definitely will be a book to revisit again in the future. Right now, I\"m planning to revisit all of my highlighting I did and really internalizing all of the interesting insight and arguments he makes through this.

Most of the book is taken up with re-tellings of the Biblical stories of Cain and Abel and Noah.Many people have noted Karl Ove Knausgaard's way of writing in what seems to be a flat, circumstantial style, filling pages with the most mundane details, while all the time creating a book that the reader is unable to put down. I don't know how he does it.As in Knausgaard's other books, large and intriguing themes appear and disappear like fish leaping from the ocean: reflections on the nature of time and history, and most strongly, on the progressive loss of the presence of the divine in the world. (The book's fictional scholar concludes that the divine realm has actually been deteriorating through the ages, and that the angels have become trapped in materiality \u2014 a conclusion that not surprisingly causes him to be examined for heresy by the Inquisition.)For almost the entire time I was reading A Time for Everything I wondered, How does this all hang together and where is it going? I still don't think I have good answers to those questions, but after finishing the book and reflecting on it I was left with strong but hard-to-pin-down sense of artistic wholeness.One question that haunted me while reading was: Who is the narrator? Knausgaard provides a kind of answer by ending the book with a startling Coda, a diary-like chapter by a man who is, to put it mildly, Not Doing Well: living as a recluse on an isolated Norwegian island after having committed some unspecified terrible deed. We have to conclude that he is the author of the book that we've almost finished, and this understanding forces us to look back in new ways on everything we've read.Karl Ove Knausgaard is, I think, one of our great writers, and this is a fine book, full of many of his strengths. But I'd encourage readers who don't know his work to start with A Death in the Family, the first book of his six-volume My Struggle.

Our ways and nature had been much investigated by thinkers and storytellers since the old days. Yet no one fully understood God, the divine. There were just too much assumptions and uncertainties involved in the contemplation. One of the ways the nature of the divine can be explored was through a study of an intermediate being, someone between man and God. The angels \u2013 less than God, more than men \u2013 could hold the key to an understanding of the nature of the divine. What angels are like was intermittently depicted in the Bible and in church murals. The fertile ground of literature was also used in dramatizing the acts of the angels.A systematics of the angelic orders, based on the above premise, was what the Norwegian novelist Karl O. Knausgaard attempted in A Time for Everything (in UK: A Time to Every Purpose Under Heaven). The literary imagination, along with its unlimited sympathy and generosity, was a robust stage in which to construct from available materials the conditions and assumptions on the angels as the direct link between the human and the divine. The manifold riches of a modern novel, unshackled by dogma, could approximate the variety of life experiences and their daily miracles. Its prose and form could hold up large vistas of physical and spiritual landscapes. The religious order of readers was constantly inducted into the novel's power to mesmerize, to quicken the senses and open up selves to radical ideas and identities.Knausgaard did for the selected stories of the Bible \u2013 mainly from the Genesis \u2013 what Jos\u00e9 Saramago did to the gospels in The Gospel According to Jesus Christ. The stories were familiar to us such that they had acquired the status of the \"definitive, official version\". Yet for Knausgaard, the Biblical stories must be calling for a creative adaptation.The only things that have always been remembered are the story of the first people who were driven out of paradise and into the valley, the story of the two brothers Cain and Abel, and the story of the great flood. But all the details about these people and the world they lived in were gradually erased. And as each new age is convinced that it constitutes what is normal, that it represents the true condition of things, the people of a new age soon began to imagine the people of the previous one as an exact replica of themselves, in exactly the same setting. Thus Cain and Abel became nomadlike figures who lived and operated in a flat, burning hot, sand-filled world, of olive and fig trees, oases, camels, asses, robes, tents, and little whitewashed stone houses. Gone were all the pine trees, all the fjords and mountains, all the snow and rain, all the lynxes and bears, wolves and elk. In addition, all the infinitely delicate nuances in the relationship between the brothers were lost over time, such that only the bare details remained: Abel was good, Cain bad, Abel was a shepherd, Cain a tiller of the soil.And so Knausgaard recreated some \"lost\" details in the Old Testament, retouching the obscured details like an art restorer working on a fresco that has faded from the accumulation of dirt and grime. He wanted to capture the \"infinitely delicate nuances\" (emphasized above) of the stories of the creation, of rival brothers Cain and Abel, of Noah and the great flood, of Christ on the cross, etc. This time the stories were not just centered on the fury of God but on human and angelic struggles.The selected characters acquired subtlety and realism beyond (or against) their traditional portrayals. The fount of these stories was God, the Author, but he probably will not appreciate the telling.It is clear the whole time that the human condition is not something [God] has experienced. If he knows anything about it, it isn't from within. Only someone who lacks insight into the human condition could despair over its evilness, as the Lord does time and time again throughout the Old Testament. Perhaps he knew mankind, but he couldn't have understood them \u2013 or he wouldn't have been so surprised that they ate from the tree of knowledge, despite his emphatic prohibition, or that they could kill their own brothers, or that they built a tower almost up to heaven.God, the narrator of the novel was implying, was not a good novelist. Being an inquiry into the angelic orders, the framework chosen to approach the divine must necessarily imbue the composition with an anthropocentric (novelistic) concreteness, tangibility, portents and omens, and subversion.The story was framed by the figure of Antinous Bellori, an eccentric sixteenth century theologian who wrote On the Nature of Angels (1584). Bellori was a melancholic figure in the mold of Sir Thomas Browne \u2013 presumably there are two lines in Sir Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia epidemica of 1646 that referenced Bellori's book \u2013 and Robert Walser, with Bellori's specialized system of microscopic handwriting similar to Walser's \"microscripts\". The structure of Bellori's book was loosely that of the present novel.On the Nature of Angels consists of three parts. The first contains a catalog of all 189 angelic manifestations in the Bible, and the second discusses what conclusions can be drawn about the angels from these. The third, which initially looks at angels' non-Biblical appearances, ends in a discussion about the question that is the work's main theme: Can the nature of the divine undergo change?It was a plausible structure to ascertain the (changing) nature of the divine. The third part ultimately led to the exposition of Bellori's thesis on the mutability, and hence fallibility, of the divine, and it was closely tied to how the novelist fulfilled the requirements of the structure. How exactly the evidences to support Bellori's thesis was teased out by the narrator/commentator (a writer figure that conveniently distanced the novelist from the story) was a pleasure to behold. The conclusion was already provocative but the \"proof\" was a daring combination of logic, scientific deduction, art criticism, and literary speculation. It necessitated the evaluation of the concept of the divine through variegated narrative registers. Absolute categories were interrogated; official versions were glossed over; and the religious abstractions, viewed from a new prism of understanding. Knausgaard's brand of prose, similar to that of his protagonist Antinous Bellori, was closely related to \"his religious speculations\": \"While writing On the Nature of Angels, [Bellori] studied every conceivable and inconceivable text in which angels figured, and thus formalized his intuitive insight into angelic mutability\". The product of this rigorous research was reflected in the book's hyperrealist prose: the descriptions were individually particularized in space and time, making every detail not only \"a detail\" but this detail: Bellori contemplated everything he saw. Whether it was fish, waterfalls, trees, mountains, birds, insects, or flowers, he saw only the unique. If one reads his notes consecutively, from beginning to end, a feeling is gradually fostered of the infinity of the world. Not \"trees\" nor even \"a tree\" but this particular tree right here, now, as it is. Not \"fish\" nor even \"a fish\" but this unique fish right here, now, as it darts suddenly across the sandy bottom through the clear, sun-spangled water. Its tail's rapid movement from side to side, the stream of water through its gills, the flat shadow gliding over the bottom beneath it ...The particularities of details were evident in the sumptuous landscapes and character sketches. Against the fleeting moment of time and the constrictions of space, those details seemed to float in the reimagined pastoral landscape of the Bible. The novel was a sobering call for curiosity and open-mindedness in an age of uprightness and morality. Skepticism could be a form of enlightenment if it did not compromise unconditional beliefs for something hardly understood. Lamech, Noah's father, contemplated a single piece of advice to give to another son of his. What he came up with was simple enough: Always ask yourself: what if it's the complete opposite? A Time for Everything is an intelligent novel that dared to think the opposite of things and to rethink the dogmatic abstractions of the divine. With the passage of time, God had become an abstract God and the idea had become unassailable. The reverse, in fact, was always an option [emphasis added]: It is hard to imagine, as Bellori said, that God and his divine creatures would exist without any sort of link with the human, raised completely over matter, as Thomas Aquinas and like minds maintained. As far as they were concerned, God in all his forms was absolute \u2013 absolute purity, absolute enlightenment, absolute perfection \u2013 but just what that absolute really was, or how it really developed, apart from being like light, is unknown. But because God in this way is defined as everything man is not, and never can be, it's easy to accept it and believe that things really are that way, and that this abstract God is the true God, when really it's the opposite: the abstract God is the more human, precisely because it equates with mankind's concept of what the most beautiful, the most elevated, and the most perfect is. Despite such grand pronouncements, the book's intellectual rigor was not solemnized but rather metafictionally weighed. The fascinating story and religious speculations of Bellori, the adapted Bible stories, and the narrator's psychology at the end were all welded together by traditional suspense and vaulting improvisation. Each narrative block was a stunning set piece and, collectively, they carried Bellori's theory on the fall of the angels. What was brilliant about the whole thing was how within the novel's broad structure (borrowed from Bellori's fictional book) which the narrator was loosely mapping, the biblical stories were intricately tracing out the basic thesis through their own internal structures. The story of Noah, for instance, demonstrated a suspension of the linear narrative through successive digressions. As each digression closed its loop, the characters were revealed as chastised by the momentous events in their lives or shaken to the core by their encounters with angels \u2013 divine proxy \u2013 in any of their mystical forms. Readers might yet surface into the world with a more nuanced perception of God. And Bellori's mantra of negation might as well see us through: We know nothing. Nor is there anything to know."}, {"userName": "Paul Fulcher", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher", "userReview": "A very ambitious novel - not all the parts are completely successful nor is it entirely coherent as a whole, but a stimulating attempt to do something very different to the usual novel. The key framing device is a treatise on angels written by a (fictional) 16th Century Italian, Antonius Bellori. Aged 11 he encounters two of them, and what he experiences is so different from what he would have expected, that he dedicates the rest of the life to studying angels. His treatise involves a fundamental re-think of angels, based on a detailed re-examination of the references in conventional and apocryphal scriptures, as well as their post-scriptural manifestations as documented in literature, history and art. Bellori's key assertion is that the divine is not immutable and angels have changed both their physical nature and their interaction with humans significantly over time, as indeed has God. Once that is accepted, as well as treating Old Testament stories as representing physical reality and valid in it's own right, rather than merely foreshadowing Christ, then a complete re-imagining follows. However, what are reading is not Bellori's work, but rather a commentary on it, and on his life, from the narrator. And during this commentary, we also get a detailed expansion of some key biblical stories where angels play a role - in particular, the story of Cain and Abel, the Flood and the tale of Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The first two in particular are actually more like novellas embedded within the main book - running to 100 and 200 pages respectively - and the role of the angels is relatively limited. The book's Cain and Abel, other than sharing a name - and an ultimate fate - seem to have little overlap with the biblical characters and the story seems set in a world more like the American wild-west than pre-historical times, with a world of bridges, furnished houses, even guns in Noah's time. As I was reading this section, these anachronisms rather grated - they seemed either clumsy or worse a rather simple attempt at post-modernism. However Knausgaard/the narrator does later neatly justify them, by reference to the Flood which destroyed and reshaped the world completely, and was designed to wipe out the traces of angels' influence on human life (based on the Genesis 6 verses that tell of angels inter-breeding with humans): \"Apart from their carnal lust, these angels also brought their knowledge to mankind, knowledge about everything from medicine, mining and weaponry to astronomy, astrology and alchemy, according to the Book of Enoch. Furthermore, it is quite obvious that the angels' activities were the direct cause of the great flood\". But why does no trace of this more advanced pre-diluvian society remain in the written record? According to the book: \"As each new age is convinced that it constitutes what is normal....the people of the new age soon began to imagine the people of the previous one as an exact replica of themselves, in exactly the same setting. Thus Cain and Abel became nomad-like figures who lived and operated in a flat, burning-hot, sand-filled world of olive and fig trees, oases, camels...\" On to New Testament times, and Bellori imputes massive significance into the absence of angels between their appearance at Jesus's birth announcement and his resurrection - his conclusion is that it \"could be that they were shaken to their core....now [God] had flaunted the greatest prohibition of them all\" - the incarnation was God doing what angels had been condemned for thousand of years earlier and which had caused the Flood. Bellori makes an even more radical conclusion at the end of his life - and one which is evidenced only by a 14th Century frescoes rather than a contemporary source - that God himself died permanently on the cross, and angels are now trapped on earth. And this highlights one oddity of the book. Many of the theories expounded by Bellori / the narrator are carefully researched and plausibly evidenced, ultimately by Knausgaard as the author of the book we're reading, but others (such as in the paragraph above) rely on some rather heroic leaps of logic or highly selective readings of the evidence. Knausgaard seems to rely on the device of his fictional narrator reporting that \"according to Bellini\" to doubly distance himself from the weaknesses of his own arguments. A rather rapid section then explains the story of angels after Bellori's death and has them becoming first the baby-like cherubs of 17th Century art and then, ultimately, a new species of seagulls in Sweden! That's not quite as far-fetched as it sounds given the logic of Bellori's theories, but seems designed mainly to provide a bridge to the final section. The book makes a very sudden shift in the last 50 pages, when the book's narrator who, for the first 470 pages has been anonymous and in the background, suddenly takes centre stage and narrates his own story in coastal Sweden, the only explicit link to the rest of the book being the frequent appearance of seagulls (and the narrator's father brief explanation to him of their origin as angels). This last part provides an intriguing link, both thematically and stylistically, to Knausgaard's more recent fictional-autobiographical \"My Struggle\" series of books, in particular the first \"Death in the Family\" based around his father's death. My Struggle is known for the hyper-detailed descriptions of real-life, the un-adorned text written very quickly and without revision, and the unflinchingly, perhaps overly, honest character portraits of Knausgaard and his family and friends. There is a massive contrast to the first 470 pages of \"A Time...\" with his heavily researched, highly imaginative and poetic story. In the last section, the narrator, now named, is clearly not Knausgaard but the themes are similar. Reference is made to his father's violent and possibly self-inflicted death and to a shameful action of the narrator, but no details are given of either, together with a painful self-harming episode. And the prose becomes as detailed (when the narrator answers a phone call from his mother, we get two paragraphs of things like how many times it rang and where he gets the best reception), if not as deliberately flat, as My Struggle. Overall - a very worthwhile read, and particularly recommended to Knausgaard fans as the sheer contrast adds to the appreciation of his later works."}, {"userName": "Daniel Chaikin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin", "userReview": "26.

I will say that I'm not a fan of prolonged satirical but entirely true to the text biblical retellings. I fully understand the bible demands some satire, but I don't typically enjoy it. I don't really know why, other than to say that I'm not really a fan of satire in general. But 100 pages on Cain and Able with unsettling modern touches, and, far worse, 200 pages on Noah's extended family with guns and other non-biblical technology (re-located to Norway, by the way), clever as it was, was really really pro-longed. He also covers Lot and Ezekiel (and his wheel) too, but the length on these was reasonable.The sort of faux subject of the book is a sixteenth century Italian theologian, Antinous Bellori, who came across real angels as a child, and wrote about them anonymously and heretically, carefully studying the existing biblical and related texts.

Unlike most other reviewers, I had not read other Knausgaard books. I picked it up because I like challenges and I\u2019m always interested in \u201cmidrash,\u201d i.e., people expanding, imagining their way deeply into ancient myths and stories, particularly Biblical ones. Given all that, this turned out to be a very tough book for me to finish, but I did.Knausgaard clearly has an incredible love of detail and a rich imagination. In fact, the amount of detail in the book is mesmerizing in a strange way; it kind of hypnotizes the reader. I think it was that deep immersion that kept me going \u2013 and at the same time, left me almost numb with boredom for long periods. An odd accomplishment. I liked the Cain and Abel story (which I learned later was probably a kind of fixation Knausgaard has about his own brother). Both brothers were likable and irritating and Knausgaard explored the psychological possibilities of their relationship with great skill . It took me a while to adjust to the contemporary Scandinavian feel of the primordial world, but I decided I was inside a Scandinavian imagination and kept going.I was really intrigued by the story of Lot, a mysterious character, who Knausgaard imagines as someone trying to impress the neighbors with his important angelic guests. And the idea of the angels making a mistake in focusing on him and getting too connected to humans for the first time, leading to their ultimate loss of power, was a creative way of dealing with the fact that no one but Lot and his family ultimately are warned about what\u2019s coming. I was reminded of Jack Miles\u2019 book Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God and its premise, if I recall it correctly, about God\u2019s death beginning with Jesus\u2019. But Noah\u2019s story just about did me in. Having to go back through all those generations of his family almost made me close the book. It was as if Knausgaard had decided he needed to develop all the \u201cbegats\u201d in parts of the Hebrew Bible. After a while, I was just plowing along trying to get to the flood, waiting for that long central part of the book to be over. The slow decline of the angels was painfully interesting, though the final form they take just seemed kind of small and a bit silly, frankly, after the sweeping scope of the book. I deeply appreciated the landscape descriptions \u2013 a browse of some of that is what made me buy the book. I will always be able to visualize the farm on which Noah grew up, the ark floating past his relatives, the flaming swords by the river as if they were my own memories.But I won\u2019t read another book by Knausgaard.

Most of the book is gorgeous. The opening scenes with Bellori, the garden, Cain and Abel, and especially Noah and his family were some of the most thought provoking explorations of the biblical narrative I've read. Knausg\u00e5rd is a writer's writer and is sentences are rich and his descriptions without peer. There is wisdom here. And serious theology. Questions and puzzles I will be pondering for awhile. Spoilers: Had he ended the book when Bellori ended I would have given this seven out of five stars. But at the coda the book lost its moorings. In the last 50 pages there is only one passing reference to the proceeding material (and a silly one at that). It seems like a bit of irrelevant early creative writing that he found tucked in a drawer from his undergraduate years that he'd never found a use for and just threw it on the end because he'd promised his editor x pages and he had burned out on the project. Or something. It had the flavor of his 'My Struggle' but less interesting and completely uncontextualized. I'm sure you can (as I'm sure people have), made up reasons for the presence of this bit of irrelevance, but for me it was like finishing a gourmet meal with spoon full of peanut butter. The first part of the book is genius.

Het bijzondere verhaal over de fictieve geleerde Antinous Bellori die in de tweede helft van de zestiende eeuw als kind getuige was van een verschijning van twee engelen... Gefascineerd door die verschijning wijdt Bellori zijn leven aan het bestuderen van de engelen en schrijft hij een - alweer fictief - tractaat \"Over de aard van de Engelen\". Best grappig allemaal en met veel fantasie en verve geschreven, vaak leest het als een spannende roman. Zoals in alle Knausgard-romans, opnieuw een niet courante structuur: het verhaal over Bellori wordt afgewisseld met bijbelverhalen - Ka\u00efn en Abel en het verhaal van de zondvloed. Zeker het gekende verhaal van Noach en de zondvloed leest als een spannende thriller - je moet zo denken aan de recente tsunami in Azi\u00eb... Leuk is het dat Knausgard deze verhalen zo \"levendig\" vertelt: hij voegt aan de personages - die wij gewoon als \"figuren uit de Bijbel\" kennen - heel wat diepgang en psychologie. Het worden op deze manier eigentijdse verhalen en je raakt ervan in de ban. Het einde van Bellori's zoektocht - een echte \"jacht\" naar engelen, is t\u00e9 gek. Het laatste hoofdstuk, wanneer een zekere Henrik Vankel - een figuur die nogal wat autobiografische kenmerken heeft - op een haast onbewoond eiland gaat wonen en overhoop ligt met zichzelf is een nogal bizar einde. Is dit metafysisch bedoeld? Is de auteur nu in de \"hemel\"...? Het roept veel vragen op.Ik heb deze roman wel graag gelezen. Het is ook een luchtig om fictie te lezen van Knausgard, na de vrij zware \"Mijn Strijd\" - reeks.

The fictional Italian boy Antinous Bellori begins and ends the novel proper as subject of an anonymous narrative describing his happening upon two angels in the woods -- they were fishing with a spear in a river -- and his subsequent, though delayed, long quest to see one again. In between several Bible stories are retold in a seemingly Nordic setting; the one about Noah and the implications of he and his wife and sons and their wives alone escaping destruction in the great flood has many long passages requiring patience, followed by a stunning conclusion.Appended to the stories of Bellori and those from the Bible is an account of a self-exiled, very unhappy young man. The relationship of this coda to the rest of the work is something to ponder; Ingrid Rowland's review is not to be read before the book itself, but is fascinating afterwards. The title in UK editions is more Biblical: A Time to Every Purpose Under Heaven: A Novel of the Nature of Angels and the Ways of Man, so nothing above should give anything away; those who brave the long parts in this long novel will be rewarded."}, {"userName": "Nathaniel Popkin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24243638-nathaniel-popkin", "userReview": "This review originally appeared on nathanielpopkin.netFor my birthday in August, my wife Rona bought me two books by the Norwegian novelist Karl Ove Knausgaard. She was particularly interested in the recent book My Struggle, translted by Don Bartlett, put out in English by Archipelago Books, and reviewed in both the New York Times and The New Yorker, but she also bought the 2004 A Time For Everything, translated to the English by James Anderson. (Despite the publicity and the author's fame in Europe, she couldn't find the book for sale in our usual places, or even the excellent Browser Books in San Francisco, where we were traveling.)When we came home from San Francisco, I started reading My Struggle, whose narrator--certainly the author himself--was a young novelist, desperate for more time to work on his oeuvre. The book opens with a long remembrance of the narrator's childhood relationship with his father, and then about 30 pages in it switches to the present. It's 2008, the once sensitive young man is a writer with a couple of books under his belt and a wife and young kids. It was at this point I turned to the title page. Yes, Knausgaard was born only a few months before me. Then I read on:I have always had a great need for solitude. I require huge swathes of loneliness and when I do not have it, which has been the case for the last five years, my frustration can sometimes become almost panicked, or aggressive. And when what had kept me going for the whole of my adult life, the ambition to write something exceptional one day, is threatened in this way my one thought, which gnaws at me like a rat, is that I have to escape. Time is slipping away from me, running through my fingers like sand while I\u2026do what? Clean floors, wash clothes, make dinner, wash up, go shopping, play with the children in play areas, bring them home, undress them, bathe them, look after them until it is bedtime, tuck them in, hang some clothes to dry, fold others, and put them away, tidy up, wipe tables, chairs and cupboards. It is a struggle\u2026Reading this, I was conflicted. For one, the narrative was awful close--in previous passages he had perfectly evoked the close distance of parenting, the impossibility of distinguishing one moment from the next\u2014and I was starting to sweat. Like my own father, I feel myself in a constant battle with time, and I spend most of mine not writing something exceptional. On the other hand, while I strongly desire to be alone, I can usually remedy this by taking a few days in the mountains myself\u2014even an afternoon in the city on my own has its clarifying effects. And I don\u2019t resent the stuff of life. Who, really, wants to the automaton in desperate, blinding pursuit of one single thing?So I went no further with My Struggle (though it sits here next to me now).Instead, I immediately picked up A Time for Everything, only to realize that Mr. Knausgaard had already written something powerfully exceptional, a kind of exegesis on wonder. Here is how the book opens:Antinous had been born in 1551 at Ardo, a small mountain town in the far north of Italy, where in all likelihood he remained until he began to study in 1565. Aprart from one particular event, to which he was to return time after time for the rest of his life, little is known about his early years. The names of his parents and native town do not figure anywhere in Antinous\u2019s writings, and, as they are otherwise characterized by a large amount of biographical detail, this early obscurity has aroused the curiosity of many readers. But if one is to attempt to understand Antinous, it isn\u2019t to the inner man one must turn. For even if one succeeded in charting his inner landscape as it actually was, right down to the smallest fissure and groove in the massif of his character, imperceptibly shaped by the slow erosion of events, and traced the course of the flood of feelings back to their source, one would end up no wiser and the meanings of what was being charted would remain obscure. Even if the events and relationships of his life were to correspond exactly with a life in our own time, one that we could understand and recognize, we would still come no closer to him. Antinous was, first and foremost, of his time, and to understand who he was, that is what must be mapped. The minimal emphasis we place on this difference is due perhaps in particular to the lasting influence of Freud, that speculative genius of the twentieth century, whose fatal confusing of culture with nature, combined with his equally fatal insistence on the external event\u2019s inner consequences, has influenced our self-understanding more than anything else, and lured us so far away from our ancestors that we believe they were like us. But our world is only one of many possible worlds, something of which the writings of Antinous and his contemporaries serve to remind us in no small measure.I sat with that passage for what seemed like a long time and then handed it over to Rona, and while she read it, I thought some more about my own, and our society\u2019s, desire to relate ourselves to figures of the past. Political discourse in the election season is predicated on this, with every interpretation of the intentions of the Founding Fathers\u2014who lived in a very different time than we do\u2014having enormous implications. Is it possible we don\u2019t even understand the meaning of the words said by those from so long ago?This isn\u2019t a distant issue for me. I\u2019ve been reading Daniel Mendelsohn, the literary critic and translator, who is insistent that we not ascribe our own pathologies and points-of-view onto the characters of the past. Understanding them, in their own contexts, is how we can learn of our joint, long-evolving humanity.And not only that, I\u2019ve been struggling with this in my own writing for \u201cPhiladelphia: the Great Experiment,\u201d in which the same patterns of human behavior seem to reveal themselves over and over again. And in my novel, Lion and Leopard, I have tried to create a narrative that truly takes place in 1820, but which feels viscerally alive to readers today. As I thought about this, I realized the path forward began with Knausgaard\u2019s statement, \u201cBut our world is only one of many possible worlds.\u201d Indeed, that\u2019s one of the very themes of Lion and Leopard, and of a novel to follow it, which is to be called Interrogation of an Idealist: the world we inhabit didn\u2019t have to turn out this way."}, {"userName": "Erik Koster", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1553959-erik-koster", "userReview": "Half fictionalized re-imagining of certain events that occur in the Old Testament, half theological treatise on the nature of the divine and specifically angels, and half story of the \"protagonist\" (if there is one) Antonius Bellori's quest to find angels on Earth and a discussion of the occurrences surrounding his life's work, this book is nothing short of amazing.It took me awhile to finish this book because it's been a long time since I've read anything somewhat challenging. But calling the writing \"challenging\" isn't really doing it justice, as it's not difficult to read. It's not split into three seperate sections, but it's just that each part of the story is so effortlessly weaved in and out of each half throughout the book that it just turns into a beautiful tapestry of people, places, events, and ideas that you're going to really take your time and absorb every word.So everything is great...until you get to the last few pages of the Coda and the entire Coda...all of the sudden the book takes a completely different path, and it's really ridiculous and unnecessary. I'm leaving this book at five stars because the rest of it is so great, but seriously at the last mention of Bellori just stop reading. The entire Coda should've been left out and maybe made into a completely unrelated short story.

I came across my Dad\u2019s notes as I was reading and think they give a good picture of the maddening, enthralling nature of this book:\u201cKnausgaard\u2019s strange way of writing forces attention. Only now and again are the actual things he writes about interesting, like the descriptions of the nephilim \u2013 his strength is rather in what might follow. In other words his writing is dull but one feels that it is leading to something important...one is led on. Unfortunately sometimes one gets the feeling that there will not be any resolution And therefore that one is wasting his time reading it. But the feeling of promise persists!..All this stuff seems to me to be more autobiographical than biblical, in spite of the names. Reminiscent, for instance, of many a meal round the kitchen table of the Knausgaard\u2019s in Sweden (sic) during the author\u2019s childhood, perhaps. Gone is the fictitious Italian writer Bellori, gone the cherubim guarding the way to the tree of life. We wish a return to the biography of the angels!..If the novel or Bellori\u2019s description of angels is supposed to tell you something why, oh why does it waste dull seemingly inconsequential pages of apparent autobiographical stuff on family life? Why after building up interest on Noah\u2019s meeting with God and the building of the Ark then lapsing into a flashback for many pages into Noah\u2019s family life and the oh (!) so boring description of Anna\u2019s love life, to an equally dull parting whilst forgetting entirely anything to do with angels? \u2013 or for that matter the impending flood?The force of the attraction of the reading is impossible to deny...\u201d\t\t\t\t\tGR Clarke 2009Indeed. So we are bourn along through many longueurs, presumably intended to contrast the earthy mundanity of human existence with the nature of the divine.

But when Knausgard starts his theological/philosophical treatise about the nature of angels, he lost my attention very quickly. I noticed it in his two first autobiographical books (\"A death in the family\" and \"A man in love\" too: it seems to me he wants to add depth to his story by mixing it with -in my opinion) rather uncoherent philosophical musings. At one point I thought of giving up this book (after the main two stories, Kain & Abel and Noah were finished), but luckily I stuck with it, because at the end of the book he grabs your attention again (I won't tell you how).I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a first novel by this author.

This event is decisive in Bellori\u2019s life, and he thereafter devotes himself to the pursuit and study of angels, the intermediaries of the divine. Beginning in the Garden of Eden and soaring through to the present, A Time for Everything reimagines pivotal encounters between humans and angels: the glow of the cherubim watching over Eden; the profound love between Cain and Abel despite their differences; Lot\u2019s shame in Sodom; Noah\u2019s isolation before the flood; Ezekiel tied to his bed, prophesying ferociously; the death of Christ; and the emergence of sensual, mischievous cherubs in the seventeenth century.
