Oh wait, isn't that kind of what you get most the time with religion anyway? (Sorry, random opinion entered there...)Okay, so here's the premise, it's somtime in the not so far future and the apocolypse has come. Except the apocalypse is not as expected with two Jesuses and a whole lotta zombies. So, the pick your Jesus and take a ringside seat for what's either going to be one hell of an eternity or the rapture we've all been promised.I LOVE this book. Seriously, it's brutal and bloody with it's moments of poignancy that make it moving and human at the same time. Only side note, publisher needs better copy editors. But well worth getting through the typos for all that."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Detective Philip \"Kane\" McKane is a hard nosed cop in Philadelphia who is dealing with a few new things these days besides the common garden variety thugs he has chased down through his career. The dead have come back to life and everyone is trying to cope with that. Add to this little tidbit some bloody rain and two different men who claim they are Jesus Christ and you have a pretty complicated storyline. That is just part of the premise of this complex story, which has a serial killer that hops from one body to the next, once the one it is in gets wasted, which is somewhat like the Denzel Washington movie \"Fallen\". The two Jesus's, which take the form of the anglo version (Jesus) and the middle eastern, darker skinned version (Yeshua) seem to be a crash course to face off against each other. Most folks have lined up in favor of the blond haired Jesus, including a corrupt evangelist and many of the Christian religions while other groups believe that Yeshua is the true son of God. Then there are a few folks like Kane, who don't believe in either of them. His instincts are telling him that he will play some part in determining if one or both of them are phonies...along with his efforts to rid the world of the supernatural serial killer that has haunted him nearly his entire life. This is not your traditional story with a straight line plot that leads you from start to finish. This is my first dip into the Bizarro movement of writing and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this work. I honestly was prepared for some very off the wall stuff based on some of the other works plugged in the back of this book (other author's works have some very interesting subject matter, which I will not delve into here). So when the story actually made sense, despite not being of a more traditional variety, I was happy I read it. I am a fan of zombie fiction and enjoy the different ideas that authors come up with, using the undead in a variety of ways. Andre Duza has come up with an entertaining piece that stands alone amongst the works that I have read. It is unique, brash, outrageous, fun, and definitely entertaining."}, {"userName": "Steven Rage", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1708332-steven-rage", "userReview": "The premise of the End Times and the Dead rising from the grave to walk the earth is an amazing concept, especially considering there are scores of the dead as zombies and Jesus comes back...twice. It seems as though the novel was a good 100 pages too long. It had flashes of true brilliance interspersed with writing that was not quite as polished as I would have liked. However, just for a genuinely unique look at a Tribulation of truly horrifying biblical proportions, Jesus Freaks is worth checking out."}, {"userName": "Neal Fultz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/646672-neal-fultz", "userReview": "Of the glut of zombie books that are coming out (World War Z, Monster Island, etc), this is probably the best. Rather than taking the straightfoward survival horror route, he blends in quite a bit of religious commentary. Also, Duza gets some indie cred for hanging out with the Bizzarro clique."}, {"userName": "Mick", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15573666-mick", "userReview": "Excellent opening, followed by a lot of random events, some seemingly unrelated and schizophrenic storylines.
