I found the dialogue monotone at the beginning. This ceased being an issue around the genre-typical 60-page mark; presumably, it\u2019s Pratt\u2019s version of an opening info-dump. Once tackled, the characters\u2019 personalities distinguish themselves. Marla is a sharp, logical woman and a big believer in self-sufficiency without spells. She seemingly has a great deal of metaphysical talent, but her intimidating persona relies heavily on her ability (and willingness) to physically take down her enemies. She\u2019s not a cut and dry Good Guy: \u201cMarla in person wasn\u2019t easy to idolize - she was too earthy, too cranky, and too prone to practicalities.\u201d As ruling sorcerer of her own city of Felport, she\u2019s more of a Big Picture person, quickly weighing all options and using every tool at her disposal to bring about her conception of the greater good. Fortunately, she feels a deep-seated responsibility and sentimentality towards her hometown - her methods might be seen as too callous otherwise. Pratt doesn\u2019t introduce Marla on her own ground, however. Instead, we meet her on the streets of San Francisco as she searches for a magical artifact. The choice is an interesting one, allowing us to learn about Marla the Person as opposed to Marla the Leader. We get a taste of her ruthlessness, but we also discover she doesn\u2019t shy away from problems that aren\u2019t immediately her own. As she becomes fully entrenched in the threat facing San Francisco, Marla calls on a variety of resident sorcerers. This was my favorite aspect of Pratt\u2019s world-building. Pornomancers, technomancers, biomancers and fabricators each bring their own twist to how magic can be harnessed. Their methods are as individual as their personalities, opening up a wealth of possibility for magic\u2019s use in future installments. There are other characters in play - sidekicks of a sort. The first is Rondeau, Marla\u2019s right-hand man for this mission. Though here he seems little more than a sounding board and a means of drawing out Marla\u2019s personality, his complicated yet vague background hints at potential storylines. I look forward to digging deeper into his identity. The other cohort is B, a seer whose point of view is used to great effect. He straddles the line between the magical and mundane, often acting as the voice of the reader in his confusion and concern. Though the solutions he provides sometimes border on the convenient, he\u2019s a likable, steady character and I wouldn\u2019t mind following him on a separate adventure. It\u2019s a good sign when a secondary is so intriguing as to spark the desire for a spin-off.Blood Engines can rightfully be labeled gritty. Marla is a brute force type, unapologetic in her methods, and the story includes its fair share of casualties and questionable morality (a cannibalistic character comes to mind). But that\u2019s what made me enjoy it. Pratt\u2019s assertion that the world encompasses countless predilections grants his universe a realism that many authors shy away from. He\u2019s dedicated to the idea that anything is possible in this harsh existence. I think the series will be all the better for it."}, {"userName": "Mav", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147811-mav", "userReview": "Not even finished with chapter one: I have issues...with the execution, the dialogue, the characters, the world building (or lack of), the pacing, etc. No description of what the main characters look like.

The blurb declared it was set in my hometown of San Francisco so I gave it a try. However, I must admit before continuing this review that I only read the first 60 pages or so. Other than some novel imagery (the old man with the gold frog in his mouth, for instance) it left me pretty flat. The main character, Marla, is supposed to be the sorcerous guardian of a city (not SF) who is traveling to investigate threats. But as far I gathered from as far as I read, the threats are just to her personal power, not to the city or other people. Marla gives no indication of caring about bad things (magical or otherwise) happening to other people. She arrives in a new city, which she hasn't bothered to learn anything about, and starts threatening and bullying inoffensive strangers in order to get information. Basically, I think she was a completely unsympathetic bitch, and have no idea why I am supposed to care what happens to her. She has a sidekick whose loyalty is explained thus: \"When Rondeau was just a boy, Marla had ripped off his jawbone and kept it in a jar to use as an oracle. A few years ago, when Rondeau had more or less saved Marla's life, she'd returned the jaw to him. It was too small to be put back on... but having it back comforted him. It had also secured him as an ally, and no matter how honest the gesture had been, Marla was always aware of the advantage to be had from her kindness.\" (pp 26-7) 'Cuz um, yeah, if someone ripped off my jaw and years later gave it back, I would totally be so grateful I'd be her slave for life. Huh?It was really hard for me to believe that this was written by the same person as The Strange Adventures of Rangergirl, not just because they are so different stylistically, but because Rangergirl was so much *better* -- so much more coherent, with stronger characterization and good prose quality. So maybe I'm missing something with this one, I just don't know."}, {"userName": "Felicia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia", "userReview": "This isn't vaginal fantasy so I can't put it on that shelf, dammit. :) It does have a main character that's a woman, which I liked a lot.

She may be the most powerful sorcerer in her city, but she has only days until a rival deletes her from existance. She and her faithful sidekick Rondeau (actually a parasitic spirit riding a chance-met human) travel to San Francisco to use the Cornerstone, a block of incredibly powerful magic. Getting the Cornerstone will be difficult--suriving San Francisco may be impossible. Sorcerers, gods, and technomages stand in Marla's way, and a fanatical priest of Tlaltecuhtli seeks to destroy the world. This was an odd book, because the story begins very much in media res. Marla is far from a blank slate or a new to sorcery, and she's had years to build up allies and mortal enemies. The backstories were written a little clunkily, but I was glad to see them--I love complications and contradictions. Although the story takes place exclusively in San Francisco, Marla and Rondeau's reactions to another city tell the reader a great deal about their own city, Felport. The magics are ingenious and often inventive: one sorcerer lives on a train perpetually going widdershins, another operates under the principle that reality is a computer simulation of the past. Although the writing is a little rough, the action is exciting and Marla a great protagonist. Anyone who enjoyed early Laurell K Hamilton or Kelly Armstrong should give this book a try.

She even said that she can relate to the heroine very well. Well... I can't. The plot is refreshing and more often unpredictable than not, but Marla Mason, cool but selfish, arrogant and brutal chief sorcerer of Felport, is someone I would not like to get to know. She saves her sidekick's life only because a seer prophesies that he will be crucial for reaching her goal, which is primary saving her own ass under the premise of being the best and irreplaceable ruler of her city. In addition, Marla simply trusts nobody but herself without exception, is not very attractive (she sends dandruff flying each time she fingers her scalp) and her humour is so dry that it is almost nonexistent - but entertaining though. As I mentioned: the story kept me reading. I could easily imagine the blade-runner-like atmosphere of narrow, dumpster-packed, smelling streets in the rain, the hotels and Chinese stalls of San Francisco.

The book delivers on many levels; its wild, colorful, crazy things are happening non stop, it has magic but best of all it has sorcerers that spew out sarcastic and hilarious dialogue that had me hopping through the book, their words were even better than their spells.The story is about a sorcerer who's in trouble; Marla Mason escapes her own city of Felport and travels to very interesting and funky San Francisco to find an object that can save her. Needles to say, she gets into more trouble than she's trying to prevent and many dangerous encounters await her, mainly some poisonous frogs, killer hummingbirds, all sorts of Gods and wizards, cannibals and even an adult party stands in her way of finding the cornerstone, an artifact that can help save her from another powerful spell. Too bad that her only contact in San Francisco is dead and her only way to find the object is to launch a journey through the new city and find out why sorcerers there are being targeted and killed as a strange plot involving raising something old and hungry untangles, it seems that the object she seeks is also needed by someone or something that stands behind all the killing.Armed with an alien cloak that turns her into a deadly opponent, but robs her of her humanity every time she wear is, she travels with her companion Rondeau picking up friends and a nemesis or two, or three on a journey that was as fun as it was colorful and I can't wait to read the rest of the series, if it's as good as this book then it will be one heck of a ride."}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/803515-gail", "userReview": "This is the first book in the Marla Mason-Sorcerer series, and it feels like coming into the middle of a series. It's nice that these characters have backstory and history, makes them feel more real, gives them depth. But it does make you feel like you're coming in on the middle of something and you missed the opening pages. Marla is a sorcerer who is the guardian of a grubby east coast city. She's come to San Francisco to find a magical artifact because one of her rivals for running the city is about to work a spell that will destroy the city, and runs into a big mess. But the sorcerer she wants has been killed by a frog. Frog poison, to be exact, which links back to an Aztec frog god somebody is apparently trying to resurrect. The title Blood Engines comes because the bad guy believes the world runs on blood and if enough isn't shed in sacrifice to this frog god, the world's engine will run down. (One of the first Mayan-calendar-ends-in-2012 books, I believe.) The book has absolutely no romance, a lot of weird stuff happening, plenty of plot twists and turns, and the good guys win in the end.

Next thing I knew, I was sucked in completely. This novel is still gritty and dirty and rough but it is also highly entertaining well-written and creative.

That's how I would describe it, at least. It follows a sorcerer named Marla Mason, the guardian of a city called Felport, and her companion Rondeau, a spirit-in-a-bottle, if you will, who has, in the past, stolen the body of someone else. Marla has a big problem: one of her rivals is prepping a wicked spell that will end Marla's life and destroy Felport in the process. And Marla can't have any of that. Marla and Rondeau must go to San Francisco to find a magical artifact that will give Marla the power she needs to counter her rival's spell. Unfortunately, nothing is ever as simple as searching for buried treasure. There's a new boy in the City By the Bay and he's knocking off local sorcerers one by one; and Marla is caught in the middle of it. With the local talent suspecting her to be the local murderer, her wicked rival planning to cast Marla out death-style, and a disturbing murderer running around killing people with poisonous frogs, will Marla be able to get the artifact? Or will she go the way of the dinosaur?What I like about T. A. Pratt--who is also known as Tim Pratt, by the way--is that he's not afraid to push the boundaries. I'll be honest in saying that I am not terribly familiar with urban fantasy, at least not in this very modernized vein, but there's something to be said about Pratt's ability to take what would seem outlandish and absolutely insane to us and make it seem normal or, at the very least, less shocking. In some ways I think this is both a compliment and a complaint. Certain things that happen within Blood Engines are alarming; it is a highly sexualized book, for example, and takes sex to a different level, although without the overly described vulgarity of certain urban fantasy authors (who shall remain nameless). In some ways the inclusion of such sexual content into normalcy is a good thing, because it can reduce the shock value; in other ways it can hurt the overall story by making things that would otherwise have a purpose as shock value be somewhat needless. Pratt, thankfully, doesn't overload on the sexual content and I only found one particular scene to be somewhat gratuitous, though not so gratuitous as to make me uninterested in finishing the book. (Generally I'm against content for shock value, by the way, although sometimes it does have a purpose).Blood Engines is an intriguing book. It successfully creates an entire underground world in San Francisco filled with sorcerers and magical beings, although not in the fanciful and rather flashy fashion of Harry Potter, but more along the lines of what you'd expect from a Philip K. Dick urban fantasy novel, if PKD would ever have written such a thing. Pratt, interestingly enough, has created different kinds of sorcerers, each with specific focuses and leanings. For example, there are sorcerers who have an affinity with the dead (ghosts, particularly, and souls), which allows them to raise the dead and use them for their own purposes, and sorcerers who are connected with technology, allowing them to manipulate seemingly advanced objects into a lot of really mean stuff--imagine a magically enhanced electronic alarm system. Each is woven into the underground, highly urbanized feel of Pratt's magical portrayal of San Francisco. It's as if this underground culture could very well exist (and wouldn't it be interesting if it did?).I share one complaint with SQT that seems rather prevalent within urban fantasy, although more so on the paranormal side (vampires, werewolves, etc.): sarcasm is getting somewhat unruly. Marla fits into this mold, although, to her credit (and Pratt's), she doesn't become annoying (I noticed it while reading, but it wasn't something that made me want to drop the book); my complaint is mostly focused on a lack of diversity and perhaps my desire to see a more rounded Marla than I think was presented. The story and the weirdness of Blood Engines, however, kept me going and this is probably the most important aspect of any novel. No matter how funny you might think your characters are, if the story surrounding them isn't enough to keep the reader interest, then it's a failure. Blood Engines is, thankfully, interesting, though not without flaws.I enjoyed Blood Engines and I was always curious to see what Pratt would do next to make his vision of San Francisco more gritty, weird, or downright insane. I will be honest, though, in saying that urban fantasy is not my forte. While Pratt's novel was entertaining and a relatively quick read, I think my general low interest in the subgenre prevented me from enjoying it further. If you're an urban fantasy nut, I suspect you'll love this book as much as I love a good space opera. Pratt is a decent prose stylist, fitting into a popular fiction mode quite easily, and I will likely look at some of his other work before continuing with the Marla Mason books (Poison Sleep, Dark Reign, and Spell Games). This isn't to say I didn't like Blood Engines or Pratt's work within Marla Mason's world, I simply want to test the waters and see what Pratt is all about. And I think I may do that by looking at Little Gods, which has one of the most beautiful pieces of cover art I've seen in the last few years."}, {"userName": "Sonia189", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16300378-sonia189", "userReview": "This UF story has interesting elements about magic use, magical powers, views on society and so on.However, the characters truly didn't win me over and I was eager to finish this so I wouldn't have to read about them anymore.

I loved it actually. Marla is the sort of person I would hope to be if in her position, perhaps not her backstory so much (good lord does she know how to clear a room), but then you are the sum of your life experiences, so if she didn't have all of that luggage she wouldn't be who she is right? Or maybe that's an argument for the nurture vs. environment folks. All I know is that Marla was one kick-ass lady that I would be scared to meet under any circumstances.This is really more of an urban fantasy mystery than a straight urban fantasy. Almost, but not quite, noir actually. Something at least one character suggests and two others, just by being who they are, back up. I had been interested in Blood Engines for a while now, the covers catching my interest (oh Daniel Dos Santos, you just...draw me in so well with your art) and a friend mentioning how morally grey Marla could be much of the time. Unfortunately, being the slacker that I am, I put it off until I owned all four books currently in print and the author had begun the fifth novel online as a serial (Broken Mirrors). I wish I had read this series as it came out, though I can't say I'm sorry to be able to read the books back to back and not wait.Marla is everything an anti-hero should be; violence prone, selfishly motivated, sneaky, cut-throat and above all manipulative. This isn't to say she doesn't look out for her people (namely Hamil and Rondeau), and will save them if she can, but her primary focus is keeping herself alive and in power. A fact that her (for lack of a better word) retainers understand, even if Rondeau does complain about it. I have yet to read the 'prequel' story Bone Shop, but there was quite a few times throughout Blood Engines where I felt like I wasn't reading the first book at all, but the second or third book. The casual references to past exploits and misdeeds are very misleading, especially in the beginning of the novel when Rondeau and Marla are just wandering around San Fransisco looking for clues to find her friend Lao Tsung.Mostly what I enjoyed was the banter and the easy exchanges between the characters. Marla's overall tactics when talking to people varies very little (even if its in her best interests for it to do so), and she is very much a 'strike now, questions later' sort of girl, but she's also very cunning. She juggles no less then 3 threats on her life throughout the novel--the one that originally brought her to San Fransisco seeking Lao Tsung, and enemy she more or less stumbles upon while investigating and lastly the 'Big Bad' of the novel itself. This doesn't include years old promises of death, minor annoyances or casual encounters however. I believe at one point Marla asks Rondeau how many mortal enemies she has currently and he responds with \"35\".What I found most interesting was that Marla would have let the Big Bad go his way if he hadn't interfered with her own quest. Until he got too close to her own city of Felport on the East Coast, but I don't think she was joking. Not even a little bit.The novel dragged a little about 2/3rds of the way in, when plot threads came together and bounced off each other to make things very difficult for Marla. I got a bit of whiplash juggling the two or three concurrent storylines honestly, but the end was a great pay off that was true to her character. I can't wait to begin the second book, Poison Sleep immediately!"}, {"userName": "Naree", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6097900-naree", "userReview": "This was a weird one. All the way through I was irritated by the lack of depth the characters seemed to show but every now and again there was a taste of something more to Marla, though it didn't stop me thinking of her as horrendously hypocritical. She will go on and on about how she kills without remorse but then mention in passing one of her enemies being despicable for having no morals. The cloak was a good example; she tells of how she kills, uses and controls people for her own ends and then says something about how the cloak makes you inhuman. But those glimpses of her I think were just enough to persuade me. Especially the parts when she regrets and action or is proved that there is a way that she didn't consider. For me it would have worked better if there were more about her reasons for acting like a homicidal dictator. She controls Felport because she believes it would be worse off without her, is it? Or is she just another power-mad fruitcake with a god complex? I have to say, in the first half of the book I was hoping that Susan would win but by the end I am curious about her as a character and I'm reasonably glad I kept reading.I don't know whether I'll read the next one. The reviews and the snippet in the back of Blood Engines suggest that Mr Pratt's writing has grown a lot between books but whether or not it's my sort of thing I don't know. One of the most irritating things about this book was the way they'd go on. A lot of the dialogue seemed unnaturally long as if they were in a school play where they'd half turn toward the audience and explain outside the narrative. The other thing that bugged me was how the narrator would keep secrets. Marla kept going on about this terrible spell that would take her city away but never mention anything about it. Without knowing how it could possibly happen I just didn't care, it didn't seem to be real even to the characters. It also happened in conversations the characters were having, they'd sort of both have a lightbulb moment and then start whispering behind their hands, \"I've just had a brilliant idea!\" \"I know, I just thought of the exact same thing!\" Riiiiiiight. Or maybe I'm bitter because it never works for me, I can be all \"Oooo I have a brilliant idea!\" *we could get pizza* and my sister can be all \"Oooo I have a brilliant idea\" *let's go bungee jumping* and three hours later I'll be standing on a bridge with nothing between me and a splat but a bit of bouncy rope and all I wanted was a pizza.Oh and every time someone did something nasty like raping dead people or eating dead people (better than live people?) they asked \"Do you disapprove?\" and then she went off on one about how it was weird but how she understood. She could just have said \"No.\" and justified in her head. I have no idea why her talking so much bugs me but it does. It also bugged me how (I think) they both said 'disapprove' it's just such a weak word for things like rape and cannibalism. Though that's probably personal; I can't be doing with taking rape casually, which Marla seemed to do, but bearing in mind what the lass gets up to while 'protecting' the city it is at least in character.Maybe I'll see how much the next book is...."}, {"userName": "Sunhi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4795716-sunhi", "userReview": "Let's just get this out of the way, Marla is one bitchy but boss heroine. The whole book is filled with a ton of witches and wizards who are scary, strange, and unique. I've certainly never come across a witch who gathers her magic by using a train going in an endless loop. (Loved that.) More than most books called urban fantasy, this felt both urban and strange and weird, but in a good way. Even magical archetypes that appear in other series come across a little better in this book (the witch who can see multiple timelines, the prophet/oracle, and the evil Chinese mage). Now, to damn with faint praise, saying all this about how I loved aspects of this book, I simply liked this book.Let's get the bad out of the way so I can clear my review's palette with the good stuff. It was certainly memorable, but while certain scenes and characters are simply stand-out, other scenes or characters left me uninterested and unmotivated to continue reading the series. I felt like the characters I was most interested in wouldn't even be in the second book, which left me with a \"why bother\" feeling. Also, Marla is almost needlessly bitchy. She is the kind of bitchy that left me unable to sympathize and I say this as a person who is needlessly bitchy all the damned time. She seems to be bitchy almost to the point of stupidity. While this can be interesting, it also makes her seem dumb at times which is hard to find engaging.Felport, the city which matters the most to Marla, is not in this book at all. We're left with San Francisco, which makes me reluctant to move back to Felport in the second book. It seems an odd choice to start the series away from this city.Now that this is out of the way, let's talk about what I like. The snake god, the possible witch (extra hugs and kisses to this minor character), the bevy of San Fran leading wizards, the completely strange but interesting magic of the villain, Bradley. If the second book had followed Bradley instead of Marla, I'd have been there in a heartbeat. There is a lot of world-building and characterization to love. The reason I'm tempted to pick up more books from Tim Pratt is that I'm sure he must be a very imaginative man with a great ability to paint both beautiful and hideous worlds and people with words. If his other books have stronger stories, I think they have the potential to be some of my favorites.Review at: http://sunhibooks.blogspot.com/2011/0..."}, {"userName": "Niki Hawkes - The Obsessive Bookseller", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13396599-niki-hawkes---the-obsessive-bookseller", "userReview": "Via www.nikihawkes.comI have read so many urban fantasy books that, after a while, they all start to sound the same. This was not the case for \u201cBlood Engines.\u201d It was an incredibly unique novel, with a great mix of of fantasy, mystery, and just a touch of romance. Although a good deal of Pratt\u2019s works are on the bizarre side, I have to give him major kudos for originality. His perspective is refreshing, and he combines that with interesting plot-lines: As the guardian for the city of Felport (in which most of the other novels take place) Marla finds herself in San Francisco, hunting after a relic that will protect her from a threat back home. While there, things start to snowball and she gets caught up in a lot more trouble than she bargained for. I found the entire book vivid and engaging.My favorite element of this series was the excellent character development throughout. I\u2019m a stickler for good characters, and that is probably why I liked these so much. While Marla definitely steals the show, everyone from Rondeau (the main sidekick) to the most minor characters have personalities that are rich and interesting.I also have a particular affection for this author\u2019s works from a writer\u2019s standpoint. From the way he crafts a story, develops characters, and devises his plots, he always leaves me in awe. His prequel, \u201cBone Shop\u201d was particularly insightful, including author\u2019s notes at the end of each chapter. It gave a wonderfully helpful look into how he tackled each scene, and also alluded to his once a week writing schedule. It was encouraging: if you take writing seriously, you can accomplish great things despite having a hectic schedule. Anyway, I can\u2019t say enough good things about this author. The more you read, the more he blows your mind with intricate plot-lines. I really love these books \u2013 if you\u2019re sick of the same old stuff, give this series a try!Recommendations: These aren\u2019t for everyone, as I said, they are a bit bizarre by typical urban fantasy standards, and also contain some language and sexual references. However, if you liked them as much as I did, I highly recommend you also read Pratt\u2019s short stories as they provide a great back-history on some awesome characters, along with excellent examples on writing well and developing your craft.Other books you might like:\u201cMagic to the Bone\u201d by Devin Monk\u201cGrimspace\u201d by Ann Aguirre\u201cTinker\u201d by Wen Spencer\u201cBlood Rights\u201d by Kristin Painter\u201cStorm Front\u201d by Jim Butcher"}, {"userName": "Xenophon Hendrix", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026345-xenophon-hendrix", "userReview": "I went and judged a book by its cover. You see, Blood Engines by T. A. Pratt (also published as Tim Pratt) has a cover by Daniel Dos Santos. Dan Dos Santos is the top, or almost the top, cover illustrator still actually working in the science fiction and fantasy field. (The great Michael Whelan is still alive, but he has moved on to fine art.) I reasoned that if Bantam was willing to spring for a Dos Santos cover, then they must expect great things from Blood Engines.Well, the novel isn't bad. It's readable and moves right along. It has a big problem though: The main character isn't likable. Now, it terms of art, this is a daring choice for the author to make. But in terms of pleasure reading, it makes it difficult for the reader to enjoy the work and lose himself in it. We don't particularly want to experience a universe through the viewpoint of a bad person.Now, in fantastic literature that people read voluntarily and not for a required class, Stephen R. Donaldson with his character Thomas Covenant used an unlikable protagonist to great commercial and artistic success. Covenant, though, while difficult to like, was at least sympathetic. He had been through much grief and had a reason for being unpleasant. Pratt's character, Marla Mason, is arrogant, foolish, violent, exploitative, and ruthless because that is her basic personality. As the novel goes on, it is hinted that she is also, perhaps, megalomaniacal. The reader is left wondering if it would not be better if her opponents kill her off. Her only redeeming quality appears to be that she cares about her home city, which she runs much like a mob boss.Aside from the big problem of a protagonist I didn't like and didn't want to identify with, a secondary flaw shattered my willing suspension of disbelief at one point. There is a scene in which Marla Mason defeats a god in a straight-up kung-fu fight. True, the god is bound and limited, but please, we're talking a deity. Mason doesn't trick him or surprise him; she just outfights him with superior technique. Right.In short, Blood Engines isn't a bad or poorly written book, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped."}, {"userName": "Antonio Diaz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25967099-antonio-diaz", "userReview": "No soy nada aficionado a la fantas\u00eda urbana en general, porque tiende a mezclarse con el Young-Adult americano o la mal llamada dark fantasy (tambi\u00e9n conocida como fantas\u00eda [urbana] er\u00f3tica). Aunque he le\u00eddo esos dos subg\u00e9neros, he de reconocer que no son plato de mi gusto (con contadas excepciones). Sin embargo, Blood Engines, aunque tiene un componente sexual marginal, no es ni mucho menos el centro de la historia. Y desde luego no es una novela para adolescentes (es profusa en lenguaje soez y ambig\u00fcedades morales).Claramente Tim Pratt tiene un excelente sentido del ritmo, y maneja los di\u00e1logos con maestr\u00eda. El worldbuilding tiene una base un tanto manida (hechiceros y otros seres sobrenaturales sueltos en la Am\u00e9rica del presente) pero introduce elementos muy interesantes y dibuja un trasfondo rico y sugerente. Marla Mason es de lo mejorcito en tema de protagonistas que veo en una buena temporada. Es una mujer dura y directa. No conf\u00eda pr\u00e1cticamente en nadie y es terriblemente pragm\u00e1tica. Mata si tiene que hacerlo y no se desvive por hacer el bien precisamente.Me gusta mucho como Pratt te indica que Marla ya ha vivido mucho antes de la novela. Habla de su pasado antes de ser hechicera, su mentor y sus amigos, peligros a los que se ha enfrentado y gente a la que ha tenido que matar. Todo eso la ha llevado a ser lo que es, una brute-force-omancer y la regente de la ciudad americana de Felport.El desarrollo de la novela se anticipaba t\u00edpico, pero Pratt conoce los tropos del g\u00e9nero y los usa contra el lector.

It is fast-paced, funny, hard-to-put-down . . . it's GOOD fluff. I haven't read much urban fantasy, partially because so much of it looks like shite. But, I'd seen the books in the Marla Mason series around and found the cover art compelling. And, Pratt's agent is an agent I've sent a query to, so I thought I should give one of her authors a shot. The idea is this: Marla Mason is a bad-ass sorceress who runs a city called. . . well, it starts with an F. She is currently in a modern-day San Francisco, seeking out an artifact. She's brought along her bisexual, wise-cracking homeboy, whose name I also can't remember. (I read this one a couple weeks ago. Cut me some slack.) But, local sorcerers are dropping like flies, and it looks like Marla is going to have to save the day. Along the way, she meets a pornomancer, a technomancer, a couple gods, and other cool characters, many of who die in mysterious ways because of a badguy named Mutinex, or something similar. Mutex? Mulex? Anyway. I am confident I'll be tracking down book two in this series, and I have an inclination I'll be reading the whole series. So, I recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun, urban fantasy light read.

I was bothered by the tell-y-ness of it, and the fact that nothing really happened other than people walking around and talking, and the great clumsiness with which the copious exposition was provided -- I kept thinking it was a sequel to something, and that was why there were these paragraphs that went, \"When Marla first met Rondeau, she had done a terrible thing to him ...\" But my decision to stop reading wasn't really solid until the second scene from the POV of the washed-up psychic actor -- not because I didn't like that scene, but because I did, and because the actor, being a fairly three-dimensional character, really demonstrated how very flat Marla is. She's tough, and that's all she is, and everything she does, says, and likes is designed to show how tough she is. She doesn't like parties, because she's tough.

Marla is everything I don't want in my so called heroine.

I despised her from page one. Her servant sidekick could have been mildly interesting but next to Marla, so is dry rot and fungal infections.
