(LOVE)Rumors are floating around about a certain kind of creature, since the attacks happen near that weird family and when the moon is full.\nLogan has his doubts though.There is lots and lots of sciency stuff in this short little book. I skimmed over that part when I got bored but this actually wasn't a bad book. It did make me interested in other adventures that Logan gets himself into.

The main character is Jeremy Logan, a scholar and professor of history at Yale. Jeremy is working on a written study of heresy in the Middle Ages and decides to go to a mountain lodge called Cloudwater in the heart of Adirondack State Park to complete it. An old college friend of Jeremy\u2019s, Randall Jessup, shows up one day at his cabin and asks for his help. Randall is a park ranger investigating the recent and strange deaths of hikers in the park. Randall knows Jeremy is also an enigmalogist (studies phenomena beyond the bounds of regular science, investigate the strange and inexplicable) and he wants his take concerning the mysterious deaths. Jeremy agrees to help his long-time friend. The characters that Jeremy encounter are locals to the mountain area and they have their own ideas and suspicions regarding the deaths. I loved the mystery and suspense throughout the story and the ending did not disappoint. I would definitely recommend this book\u2026I am giving this one 5 STARS *****Thank you Lincoln Child, Doubleday Random House and Edelweiss for providing me with a digital copy of this book to read in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17371689-kimberly", "userReview": "FULL WOLF MOON, by Lincoln Child, is the fifth book in the Jeremy Logan series.

Boring and predictable.This book was sadly disappointing.While I used to enjoy the Preston and Child stories on the adventures of Agent Pendergast, their creativity of late seems to be on the wan.Unfortunately this is true for Lincoln Child's solo stories. Yes, the story is well written, but it's like receiving a well knitted ugly Christmas sweater.You can appreciate the quality of the construction but the product itself is not something you enjoy."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26241824-kevin", "userReview": "Let me first begin by saying that I am a huge fan of Lincoln Child's solo novels. Maybe even more so than the Pendergast series that he co-authors with, Douglas Preston. I have read every Jeremy Logan book in the series up to this point, and I love how each novel is a different adventure, set in an even more exotic setting than the last.  Jeremy Logan has been to just about the craziest places on earth that you could imagine. Whether it's at the bottom of the ocean, Alaska's remote Federal Wildlife Zone, or northern Sudan near Egypt, you can bet that there is something shocking and mysterious going on. Otherwise, you don't call upon the best in the business, Jeremy Logan. Which brings us to Full Wolf Moon, in my honest opinion the spookiest of all his book settings so far. There's something sinister and unnerving about the deep woods or forest, and who better to write about it than Lincoln Child! (minor spoilers ahead) Logan is on his way towards Adirondack State Park, to finish a paper that he has been putting off for too long. His final destination is a place called Cloudwater, a very private secluded resort, where authors, musicians, or anybody with a brain to create, can work in peace. Well anybody who knows the \"Enigmalogist\", knows that trouble and mystery always has a way of finding him. Shortly in the beginning of his stay at Cloudwater, some hikers have turned up dead in which the State Troopers and Rangers of the park, are guessing they were savagely mauled by a bear! Upon the results of the autopsy, there is now evidence and suspicion that the lone travelers were attacked by a gray wolf. Among getting involved in the case, to help a friend from his past, Jeremy goes around asking questions and gets \"blaming-fingers\" pointed toward a mysterious group of people called the Blakeneys, who have been rumored to be able to change into werewolves during the full moon! Now, let me stop here for a second. Tell me this isn't a classic, Lincoln Child novel? A spooky mystery that keeps you awake at night, wondering, just what the heck is going on?  While I would love to keep going on and on about this novel, and I easily could, I don't want to give away too much, in case you want to read it. After reading this fantastic story, I got the sense of a modern-day, Jekyll and Hyde mixed with the Wolf Man, and that is awesome! Lincoln Child always blends perfectly; science, mystery, and horror. He writes books that I love to read! This is why I have him in the top-spot of my favorite authors on my Goodreads list.  A huge thank you goes out to Netgalley and publisher, Doubleday Books, for the advanced copy of this novel."}, {"userName": "Space Out With Sci Fi in June The Haunted Reading Room", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7302570-space-out-with-sci-fi-in-june-the-haunted-reading-room", "userReview": "Review of FULL WOLF MOON by Lincoln ChildSuspension of disbelief provides strong tension throughout as our protagonist himself struggles with his intent to maintain an open mind. Dr. Jeremy Logan, Yale Professor of History, is by avocation (and a growing reputation), an \"enigmalogist,' an individual who studies and investigates odd phenomena without an apparent cause. For example, Dr. Logan has investigated \"Nessie,\" Scotland's Loch Ness Monster. When the novel commences, he is ensconcing himself for a six-week retreat at Cloudland in the scenic, densely-forested Adirondacks if upstate New York. He has scarcely arrived when a visitor appears, a former friend from his undergraduate days, a philosopher who is also a Forest Ranger. He requests Dr. Logan, who is also a sensitive--an empath who perceives emotions and energy, both from humans and locations--to look into a series of deaths-by-mauling, each occurring in the Desolation Mountain wilderness, each during a full moon. Possible causes are bear or wolf, but the evidence is erratic. Investigators are certain the killer could not be human, due to the strength required for the degree of violence. Locals blame a reclusive clan living deep in the forest since the early 18th century, or earlier, who are believed to be both werewolves, and ritual child murders. Author Lincoln Child keeps the suspense boiling and delivers an unexpected denouement which leaves protagonist and reader reeling."}, {"userName": "Minx -The Genre Minx Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40042696-minx--the-genre-minx-book-reviews", "userReview": "Full Wolf Moon starts off with a gruesome and mysterious attack, death by mauling, that has the investigators stymied. These attacks are nothing like they have ever seen and seem to be occurring in relation with the full moon. At the start these attacks are thought to be caused by a rouge bear or wolf. Mysteriously though, the true culprit can\u2019t seem to be identified. There is just something off about the bodies that they find. Nothing seems to add up. The locals start whispering about superstitions and werewolves. This is a story where the local lore comes to life as the residents start whispering about \u201ctainted blood.\u201d Their suspicions seem valid enough to cause Randall Jessup, a forest ranger, to seek out his former college buddy, Jeremy Logan. This story is a creative blending of realism, fantasy and everything in-between.Even though Jeremy has come to the Adirondacks to \u201cget away\u201d and work on his monograph on heresy in the Middle Ages, his natural curiosity had been piqued and he can\u2019t help but look into the mystery. He decides at first that he will just run down some rumors and then he can with honesty say that he tried. There was even some points that Logan was going to throw in the towel so to speak but just when it looked like he was on a wild-goose chase something happens. Now Logan is on the hunt for the truth as he knows it. Something is hunting, something other than human.I found Jeremy Logan\u2019s character to be quite interesting. He is what is called a \u201csensitive\u201d also referred to as an empath. His character is the perfect guy for solving this mystery because in addition to being a Yale professor he also had a title of enigmalogist. In this story that title is used to describe someone who studies phenomenon that are outside the regular boundaries of science and scientific study. Really meaning occult or supernatural. These areas of study gave him the clear head that he needed to contemplate both what was considered real and fantastical. I found how he utilized his skills as an empath to be quite intriguing. It was nothing over the top but still fascinating to read.The plot itself was well developed and danced between science and the supernatural. Through twists and turns you are kept in suspense with wonder. I personally enjoyed the science fiction portion of this story. It was quite well done and conceivable enough to make you consider the theory. Then you will shake your head, laugh precariously, and maybe put off that camping trip you had planned. If you are looking for a twist on a supernatural read, then this is a story that I would recommend.This review is based on a complimentary book I received from NetGalley.

Books by the pair, or books each has written alone are (almost) always added to my fav. list here on Goodreads. I have re-read many a book by them, but having said that...This book was a huge disappointment. Formulaic, trope-laden, and seemingly, written in a rush. If I had to read about the 'bloated moon' one more time...and then I did, near the end. Not that 'bloated' isn't a good description for a huge full moon, but please, think of another word...Alas...The story of how enigmalogist, Jeremy Logan, goes to an exclusive resort in the Adirondacks to write a 'monograph,' but instead, gets involved with a mystery surrounding a hideous creature that's killing off some of the locals. It's a good idea, kind-of-tropey, but I was anxiously waiting to read this book. Because, wow! Did Mr. Child write a werewolf book? Omg, you gotta be kidding! Can't wait!I shoulda waited. The writing, dry and ordinary, lacking any sort of depth. The characters, they seemed pulled out of various books: the white-haired, eccentric scientist; his tall and gorgeous, devoted daughter; the old forest ranger friend who almost says 'gee, shucks,' a few times, but never does. (Disappointed!) Then the poet-who-lives-in-the-forest, and the creepy, inbred family which lives behind a gigantic wall made of interwoven twigs. Now come on, this is all GOOD STUFF. Makes me want to turn all the lights off and read it with a single, blinking light over my shoulder. I eat these books up!But it all fell flat, and was just so ordinary-ordinary. Not to mention short! When I got the book it felt like half a book. Jeremy goes here; Jeremy goes there. Jeremy talks to this guy, that girl, this guy again. He goes back to the resort, writes a bit, sits and thinks and then gets up and then he goes here and then he goes there ... So though I was going to give the book two stars, I sat back and looked at it as a whole. Not a bad story. I loved the set-in-the-woods scenes - pristine forest, fire towers, gloomy atmospherics. This is where Mr. Child excels. Description and place. Yes, he's got that down in spades. But the entire book just felt so hollow, so empty...So three stars, maybe a 3.1.

They specialize in the not-so-supernatural thriller. In most cases , and especially with the Pendergrast series, this involves a mystery of seemingly supernatural origins but ends up being something from the natural, albeit the very imaginative and slightly farfetched natural. These Scooby-doo books, as I irrelevantly like to call them, are fun to read but I tend to go more for the supernatural scare rather than the manufactured natural one. However they are great summer reads or, on the other side of the seasons, fireside reads.When Lincoln Child is writing solo, he likes to keep a good thing going. His protagonist is Jeremy Logan who calls himself a enigmalogist which is \"an investigator who specializes in analyzing unnatural phenomena with no obvious scientific or rational explanation.\" As one may surmise from the title of this fifth installment of the Logan series, Full Wolf Moon is centered on the theme of lycanthropy. In the Adirondack Mountains, two hikers has been found dead with their corpses ripped apart, both having happened on different full moons. Logan is attending an artist and scholar retreat when his college friend who is now a ranger in the area asks him to investigate the deaths. The official explanation is a rogue bear or wolf, but the timing of the killings suggest another explanation and the strange seclusive family that lives in the woods seem to be the town residents' favorite suspect.While Full Wolf Moon has a good sense of suspense and scares , it is more mystery and science fiction then horror and certainly not supernatural. As with Child's other books, there will be an explanation. Getting there is where the fun is . Child brings together some interesting science into the story that I suspect carries a good mix of fact and fiction. I think I prefer Child solo as compared to the Pendergrast series Preston & Child are known for. Mostly because Jeremy Logan is more accessible . He seem to be the professor next door type while Pendergrast is fairly foreboding. The pace and formula though is pretty much the same. These are light reads. This particular book is fairly predictable and feeds you a good amount of red herrings before the final reveal. I would recommend this more for the mystery fan than the horror aficionado. It may not take you into any new territory but if you read it you probably know what to expect and won't be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/305395-maggie", "userReview": "Scrappymags 3-word review: A little freakyGenre: Mystery/horror, suspenseShortest summary ever: Something is attacking wayward hikers in the Adirondack Mountains.

In the past, strange things happened around the full moon (part of the basis for the word lunatic) and people I've known who work in hospitals say the time around the full moon is always busier in the ER than the rest of the month. It's because of these things that I can totally see the events in this book happening.I've read many Lincoln Child books, those he wrote alone and with Douglas Preston, and this is one of the better ones. It could fit right in with the Pendergast Series if Jeremy Logan were richer and more cultured. It has just the right blend of science, a smidgen of history, and plenty of mystery to get me to finish the book in 24 hours.Jeremy Logan travels to a remote area of the Adirondacks to work on a history project, when an old friend contacts him to ask for help in a string of deaths in the area. The work appears to be that of a rabid bear, but not all of the evidence points to that, and why are the attacks happening around the full moon? Logan demurs at first, but then gets wrapped up in the mystery as more people die.The mystery is a good one. I thought I knew what was happening fairly early on, but I'm pleased to say I was wrong and it's probably not what you think.

It felt somewhat rushed at the end, but it still satisfied.I'm now going to go out and get the few Lincoln Child books I haven't already read.I was given a copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900200-cheryl", "userReview": "Tainted blood and the lunar effectI like this Jeremy Logan series written by Lincoln Child - I've read a couple other of the now five books in the series. I also like the Pendergast series that he co-writes with author Douglas Preston.Dr. Jeremy Logan is a scholar/historian and a Professor of History at Yale that has come to Cloudwater in the Adirondacks as an artist-in-residence. He comes to this retreat to hopefully finish a monograph on heresy in the Middle Ages that he's worked on for years.But it doesn't take long for him to get called on to use his skills as an empath and enigmalogist, someone that looks into unusual or supernatural happenings. People are being killed in terribly brutal circumstances in the Desolation Mountain area near where Logan is staying and a friend asks him to look into the deaths that are happening during full moons.This was a fun story to read. I like Logan's character and I like the way the author introduced the different characters in the story. The author was also especially good at describing the area in the Adirondacks that this story unfolded in. I felt like I was in the claustrophobic dark and dank forests. Or in the beyond rugged area around Desolation Mountain.I've just purchased the other books in this series. I'm going read/re-read them all.I received this book from Doubleday Books through Edelweiss in exchange for my unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Cherei", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5171527-cherei", "userReview": "Full Wolf Moon will have you looking over your shoulder and jumping at every little sound if you're reading it in the woods.. perhaps in a cabin! I always enjoy when an author I've read and followed for nearly two decades makes a foray into writing about something that is a bit out of their norm. Lincoln Child must have written this in a fevered writing spell. It's so dang fast paced.. that the reader cannot catch a breath before a whole new direction is taken! I absolutely loved this story! It reminded me of the days of my youth.. while sitting around a campfire telling stories and yarns of what could be just hovering just outside your view of the forest, in the dark.. The story flows so durn smoothly! The main character, Logan just wants to finish a paper and not be bothered while he's holed up in a small hotel in the middle of no where. One of his old buddies, just happens to live in the area.. and has been dealing with a ferocious killer. One that has been shredding the victims to barely recognizable, leftover carcasses. He hints that it seems to be the work of a werewolf. But.. everyone knows.. that's just a myth. Right?You'll just have to read it yourself! A very fun read!!"}, {"userName": "~\u2606~Autumn\u2665\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36269827-autumn", "userReview": "I sure enjoyed this different werewolf book. It has a person who is somewhat like a wolf due to genetics and a \"mad scientist\". It was a little scary for me and I did not want to put it down. I will have to get more of his books. One of the GREAT things is no bad language. Its so hard to find a scary book these days that is clean!"}, {"userName": "Chris Carroll", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390579-chris-carroll", "userReview": "Another expertly crafted thriller from Child, featuring enigmalogist Jeremy Logan.

I like the way the author takes the supernatural and debunks with science. Good action and mystery."}], "description": "Legends, no matter how outlandish, are often grounded in reality. This has been the guiding principle behind the exhilarating career of Jeremy Logan, the \"enigmologist\" \u2014 an investigator who specializes in analyzing phenomena that have no obvious explanation. Logan has often found himself in situations where keeping an open mind could mean the difference between life and death, and that has never been more true than now.Logan travels to an isolated writers' retreat deep in the Adirondacks to finally work on his book when the remote community is rocked by the grisly discovery of a dead hiker on Desolation Mountain. The body has been severely mauled, but the unusual savagery of the bite and claw marks call into question the initial suspicions of a wild bear attack. When Logan is asked to help investigate, he discovers no shortage of suspects capable of such an attack \u2014 and no shortage of locals willing to point the finger and spread incredible rumors. One rumor, too impossible to believe, has even the forest ranger believing in werewolves. As Logan gets to know the remote deep-woods landscape, including a respected woman scientist still struggling with the violent loss of her father in these very woods, Logan realizes he's up against something he has never seen before.", "title": "Full Wolf Moon\n      \n          (Jeremy Logan #5)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32336166-full-wolf-moon?from_choice=true", "average": 3.67, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1478661376l/32336166.jpg", "reviews": 566, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11091.Lincoln_Child", "name": "Lincoln Child"}], "type": ["Thriller", "Mystery", "Fiction", "Horror", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32336166-full-wolf-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32840649-full-wolf-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34018866-full-wolf-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36194328-full-wolf-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39026.Deep_Storm", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3986318-terminal-freeze", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18416.Utopia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11007668-the-third-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39027.Death_Match"]}
