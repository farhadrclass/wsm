But why do some these healthier celebrity cookbooks tend to call for items listed like this when the average joe just wants a good cookbook with accessible/ reasonable ingredients without having to run to a specialty shop?

I did WW years ago and got to my goal weight but life - in the form of several major setbacks from the death of a beloved grandmother to the cancer diagnosis of my daughter - had other ideas. I gained lots of weight during my daughter's battle versus cancer. After her death, the depression that followed did not help. About a year later, at the heaviest I've ever weighed I turned back to WW and had tried off and on for several years to lose weight. It wasn't until the latest program that I started in January 2016 that I was able to lose almost 65 pounds over about 18 months. So I enjoyed her insights and the recipes were interesting, too. Most of them were immensely impractical - well, unless you have enormous amounts of free time or a personal chef - but there were several that looked doable enough that I will be trying them out:Red Pepper, Sausage & Fennel SoupMulligatawny SoupTurkey ChiliChicken Tikka Masala Quotes to remember:When you know better, you do better.You have to be willing to give yourself the best care you can, every day."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34050713-melissa", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this cookbook. I really tried to like this cookbook but after being disappointed multiple times I finally came to the sad realization that these recipes were not for me. One star is for the sections containing inspirational stories about Oprah's struggle with food and dieting. These were wonderful to read and I found many of the things she said relatable. One star is for the recipes that I did like. The recipes I enjoyed the most were Spicy Bean and Collard Greens Soup, Turkey Chili, and Turkey Meatloaf. I felt both of these were fairly easy to make and the ingredients were affordable and easily sourced, with the exception of the dried chiles as these may be more difficult to locally source for some people.The Chicken Tikka Masala was very good but felt fussier than it should have, and for that reason I put that recipe into the \"good, but...\" column. Also in that column is the Penne Pasta with Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, and Basil. Sadly there were recipes that elicited a response of pure disappointment. These were the Kale and Farro Soup (just blah), My Smothered Chicken (very one dimensionally spicy), Art Smith's Unfried Chicken (again, one dimensional with the heat), and the Barbecue Chicken (which was somewhere between ok and meh). There is a salad section that I did not cook from, and to be honest felt no desire to cook from. The pictures looked lovely but after so many meh and blah experiences I just couldn't justify the time and energy to be disappointed again."}, {"userName": "Bonnie  Zink", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2908615-bonnie-zink", "userReview": "I've loved all things Oprah for what seams like my entire life. Oprah introduced me to new gadgets, new ways of living, and helped me see a better way of being. This book is a continuation of that learning. This book is a memoir and a cook book. I mostly bought it for the memoir, but was pleasantly surprised with the recipes. Whether you are counting points with Weight Watchers or looking to eat better, the recipes in this book will not disappoint. Oprah's taste for spice is a bit higher than my own, but I can work with the variety of recipes in this book. I love that she has included some of her favourite kitchen gadgets and tells us why she loves them. I am looking forward to trying out some of the recipes in this book. Whether you are interested in knowing more about Oprah's life and struggle with food or looking for a Weight Watcher's friendly dietary make over, this book is well worth having."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/368999-jessica", "userReview": "I wasn't really sure what to expect with this cookbook, but I always liked Oprah so I figured I'd check it out. I really liked it. She focuses on fresh, seasonal ingredients and while she does mention Weight Watchers and \"points\" it isn't the focus of the whole book, which I liked. Each section had an introduction from Oprah about her struggles with food and weight followed by recipes. The book is divided into non-traditional sections - one all about soup, one all about greens, one more international recipes, etc. There were quite a few recipes I'd like to try and overall the book was beautiful. I saw that some of the other reviews complained that the recipes were too complicated or called for too many ingredients. Looking back she does call for a lot of herbs and spices, but other than fresh herbs I would think most people would have most of them. Maybe it's just the way I'm already cooking, but this is what cooking from scratch entails - planning ahead. Of course it also helps if you have a garden in the summer to pull from as well (lots of pictures of Oprah in her gardens). Overall, if you like whole food, scratch cooking this would be a great cookbook for you."}, {"userName": "Sylvia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12581039-sylvia", "userReview": "I'm not sure this book is worth buying. If your library has it, check it out from there first to see if you find anything to your liking. I don't think there is one recipe that I would make. Don't get me wrong, they sound as if they would taste ok -- but I don't have truffle oil or truffles in my pantry. The stories of her struggles with her weight are interesting, but her accomplishments are easier done when you have professional\u200b chefs, trainers etc. at your beck and call. The photos are beautiful. If you are interested in the Weight Watchers program, I would suggest you get a dedicated WW cookbook instead of this one."}, {"userName": "Marcia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147315-marcia", "userReview": "Interesting to read about how Oprah has come to terms with her weight.

The nutritional values are also printed with the recipes. That said, this is an Oprah Winfrey book and not so much a Weight Watchers book. It still works with the program. Oprah offers some full-fat and calorie versions of her favorite comfort dishes, along with a skinnied down version, a few times.This is a quality book with beautiful photographs. Nothing heavy here from Oprah - her insights about flavor, food and her relationships with both are lighthearted. But be aware she is not light with chili peppers! Most mortals will need to adjust the spice level and add more at the table just to be safe. My only criticism of the book is that some of the recipes are too complex and some of them call for ingredients that are not readily available. I have never seen a morel mushroom in my life and do not expect to any time soon! There are enough kicked up mainstream recipes, though. The soups, stews and salads have eye and taste appeal.

I enjoyed the chapter dividers that introduced each section. I would be very interested in reading her autobiography if she ever felt like writing one. Sure, it's a bit \"commercial\" but there's something very pleasant about the tone she adopts when she writes. Some of the recipes are better explained than others but for the most part they seem easy to follow. Personally, there was a little too much spice and too many vegetables that aren't practical for me (asparagus, artichoke, etc.) but I'm still going away with a ton of new recipes to try and overall it's just a very positive outlook on food, eating, and life.

I'm glad this worked for her and continues to work, but I'm not as well off as Oprah.

This makes me remember that a career choice that I did not pick was a food photographer.. Most of the recipes have 15-20 ingredients and are pretty consuming.
