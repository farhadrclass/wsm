She really covered all bases. And then the icing on the cake was in the author's note at the end, where she reveals that she borrowed liberally from her own family history for the major characters and some of the key plot points. Wow! My only criticism is that it all got a bit too melodramatic towards the end, but it wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment."}, {"userName": "Renita D'Silva", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17336261-renita-d-silva", "userReview": "Beautiful and evocative, an epic, sprawling tale.

As such, the book is very different from what I've otherwise come to expect from her work. She here tells the story of Ned and Jack - two very different English-men (sorry, one is Scottish) who end up working together in India after having been forced to move there due to personal circumstances.I was very fascinated by the description of life in India, and believe it to be fairly accurate - or at least in accordance to what I've been told by other people/books. The descriptions of the characters were well done and interesting, although occasionally rather stereotypical. While not exactly a page-turner, I was kept well entertained during the first 500 pages, and was prepared to give it a high recommendation.Unfortunately, the last 94 pages made me change my mind. Suddenly the book turned very dark, and the ending was a lot bleaker than the rest of the book had led me to believe it would be. That in itself didn't bother me too much (I prefer happy endings, but can accept that sometimes it just wouldn't make sense), but the fact that it seemed unnecessary - or even pointless - to have it end this way did. It may be that she's paving the way for a sequel, in which case the ending may prove to be justified, but as of now, there's no indication that this is the case, and therefore a lot of my enjoyment of the book was removed.Still worth reading though, but be prepared for a less-than-happy ending."}, {"userName": "Sue Gerhardt Griffiths", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18876665-sue-gerhardt-griffiths", "userReview": "Fiona McIntosh is a magnificent storyteller and this novel had me turning the pages like a crazed woman to find out what transpired between Jack, Ned and Iris. And boy, wasn't I in for a shock at what took place in the exotic location of Kolar Gold Fields, India. Practically from the start this tale was fraught with sadness. It's a tragic story of love, loss and betrayal. The last 100 or so pages became gloomy and so totally unexpected but in my eyes the ending was perfectly satisfying. I don't enjoy books where the closing isn't fulfilling and yes, a sequel would be most welcomed but I honestly think the ending was unique and I find it boring to read every book with a predictable conclusion.My first read by this author and if any of her novels are as intriguing and compelling as this one I'm in for a seriously exquisite treat.The author's note at end is fascinating. Highly, highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Olwen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75643902-olwen", "userReview": "Jack Bryant from Cornwall and Ned Sinclair from Scotland end up in India after taking very different routes to get there and having very different reasons for being there.

Jack and Ned make friends and end up working at the Kolar Gold Fields.

It is a story of two men, the first, Jack Bryant, is a charming womanizer who is seeking to escape from a tragedy that has taken place at his family\u2019s mine in Cornwall. The second man, Edward \u2018Ned\u2019 Sinclair is on the run after escaping family problems and seeks solace in the city of Bangalore, where he meets Jack. The pair become firm friends working in the mining community but eventually find themselves in a tangle of secrets and betrayals when they both end up falling in love with the same women. It follows a storyline that is packed full of complexities and character dilemmas, which at times I found a little hard going. The novel does a good job of capturing the culture and essence of India in post war times. I found it interesting that at the close of the book, Fiona McIntosh revealed that the inspiration for this book came from her two Grandfathers, which breathes more life into this novel for the reader. Fields of Gold is a different style of book to McIntosh\u2019s other historical novels I have enjoyed more, such as The Lavender Keeper, The French Promise and The Tailor\u2019s Girl, but it still makes for a solid read."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6645941-sue", "userReview": "Loved the setting for this tale. I've been to India three times and felt Fiona captures the mood of India perfectly. The noise, the crowds, the vibrant colours were all conveyed exactly as they should have been. The story follows the lives of 2 young adventures, Ned and Jack, both of whom are running from aspects of their past. The story took me a while to get into and I dont know why I kept getting Ned and Jack mixed up.The inevitable love triangle rears its ugly head and things get complicated. For the whole novel I felt an unease that made me think we were heading for doom and gloom. This feeling made it impossible for me to really enjoy the novel.The ending had a few sharp turns and the main players did some things that were out of character and quite shallow and selfish.So I liked it but it didnt lose me in the story and I wasnt kept up late at night turning its pages like a woman possessed."}, {"userName": "Annette", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7326695-annette", "userReview": "Fields of Gold by Fiona McIntosh was a reflection of her other novels. Fiona writes a great story, this one bringing together Ned and Jack in India as young men. Each of the characters have their own issues and challenges and they become good friends. The plots in Fiona's novels are always intriguing and indeed keep the reader reading. This was a love story of sorts with all the excitement and drama of a chocolate box story. At times I felt the coincidences were a little too contrived, but it did not stop me wanting to see where the novel's course would finish. The settings were beautifully described and the tensions of the relationships were real. A great story to be recommended."}, {"userName": "Kate Loveday", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8070685-kate-loveday", "userReview": "Set in the 1920\u2019s Fields of Gold is a story of two British men, Ned and Jack, who meet in India as young men. Drawn together because of a dark secret, they become close friends. The description of life in India at that time is fascinating. The characters are well drawn and the story of the loves, betrayals and dangers the two friends and the women in their lives experience make for compelling reading.I found the ending less than ideal, with several of the characters changing their personality traits in a manner that I found not totally plausible. However, up until this rather unsatisfying ending I thoroughly enjoyed the story."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11144638-jess", "userReview": "Fiona McIntosh is one of my favourite authors. I saw her speak a number of years ago on a panel of historic fiction writers and have been reading her books ever since. She writes with rich detail, regardless of whether it's a fantasy setting or a period in the past. This story is no exception. It follows two young men in the years following the Great War, the majority of the story is set in India, a country I visited last year and have always loved. It's an interesting period of Indian history, the British had dominated for so long but their time was coming to an end, there are hints of this in Fields of Gold."}, {"userName": "Nadia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11645154-nadia", "userReview": "My 2nd book by this awesome author!Set at the end of WW2,2 young men find themselves far from home, hoping to start new lives in India's fields of gold!
