The truth is, the book goes from very fast and very gripping to very slow and very girly far too quickly. It's like reading two different books intertwined, and I couldn't care less about the second one. I seriously doubt John Grisham wrote the whole thing. Some of the portions where the girl's POV is adopted are just too intimately \"girly\" in style to have been written by him. I'm not saying \"girly\" in a negative sense at all, just a matter of tastes, but I have this very strong feeling that he had some help from a female ghostwriter, one who writes VERY differently from John Grisham.When I buy a Grisham book, I DO NOT want to end up reading a ghostwritten novel where the innocent girl with no personality ends up in bed with the rough, handsome and mysterious boss of the local literary world. WTF? Loved the beginning and the end, that actually sound like Grisham, but the middle section was a huge letdown, and it has a COMPLETELY \"off\" sound. My guess - and warning - is, this is ghost-writing gone too far. Also, the main character (Mercer) is an absolutely unbearable, pretentious woman with no likable feature at all. Maybe the woman who wrote that part of the book put her own personality into Mercer? I don't know what to think."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda", "userReview": "\"Your secrets are safe. I can't think of a soul I would want to tell.\"And these secrets are within a crime. A jumbo, over-the-top, kick in the door of modern literature, and pull down the shades type of heist. Dollar signs that even have dollar signs.When a group of well-rehearsed thieves make their way into the tombs of Princeton's lower vaulted depths, they come away with a golden grail in the form of original hand-written manuscripts of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Miraculously, they stage enough diversions that they escape the university grounds and burrow into their hideouts. But the coast is not always clear just because time passes. A flubadub occurs and two of the members are caught. Each of them utter not a word. Clear sailing for the others? Maybe yes and maybe no.Advice to oneself ala Grisham: Write what you know.So Grisham parachutes this story into the waiting arms of a bookstore owner in a small town on Camino Island in Florida. Bruce Cable (interesting name in regard to ol' Bruce's widely growing circuit in the book world) doesn't always ring his daily sales on his cash register. Bruce dabbles, on occasion, in the darker side of intellectual exchange. A first print version in impeccable condition sends his heart racing.....almost as much as a shapely woman swinging her hips and opening the bookstore door at the same time.Enter Mercer Mann who grew up on Camino Island and is a fledgling writer with a brief kiss of fame. She's now broke, unemployed, and somewhat bewildered when she's approached by a mysterious woman. A deal is struck in which Mercer will go undercover and try to get the goods on the elusive Bruce Cable. Mercer doesn't realize that someone else may be trying to get a foothold into Cable's backdoor operations as well.John Grisham presents quite a different read this time. We are immersed in the world of books and the intricate mechanisms of publishing. Dinner conversations abound with the chatter of authors bantering on about their books. It almost has the flavor of Hemingway and his feasts in Paris in the 1920's with his jaunty friends. And the drinks flow just as hard and fast.I enjoyed this one despite the fact that there is not a courtroom in sight as in Grisham's golden days. The heist itself seems to provide background noise. There wasn't the usual high tension as in times past. In addition, you may feel somewhat of a nudge that his character choices and dialogue have a bit of a different flavor for him this go-round. And different can be good.Now the ending......a swift kick in the pants and a wry smile."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "Back with another new novel, John Grisham seeks to expand his horizons with a story free of much legalese, but with the slightest hint of some criminal activity. A heist at one of Princeton's libraries puts a number of original F. Scott Fitzgerald's manuscripts in the hands of some career criminals. Quick-acting FBI agents are able to scoop up two of the five, but the others are still in hiding, along with the manuscripts. When one is rumoured to have surfaced at a small book shop on Camino Island, the FBI's Rare Asset Recovery Unit pegs Bruce Kabel as being involved and plan keep an eye on his bookselling operation. Meanwhile, Mercer Mann is approached by a private security firm to help with the reacquisition of the manuscripts under the guise of writing her next novel. Mercer has struggled with her craft and is not sure she wants to play sleuth, particularly if it means returning to Camino Island, where she spent many summers with her grandmother. Taking a risk, Mercer agrees to open some old wounds and pretends to be writing, while surrounding herself with the local writing community. Slowly, Mercer begins building bridges with Bruce Kabel, in hopes of learning more about the manuscripts. However, as she grows closer to an answer, Mercer may have second thoughts of toppling all she has built in a short period of time. With millions of dollars on the line, Mercer must decide what is most important to her. Grisham shows that he has talent to pen novels that keep lawyers and the law outside of the narrative. Sure to appeal to a different group of readers, the story offers some interesting insight into the craft of writing the next 'great novel'. I have long been a fan of John Grisham and his novels, having cut my teeth on his legal thrillers throughout the years. This story differs greatly from those and serves a completely different purpose. While the legal thrillers are usually quite sharp-edged, this book shows a much smoother edge to Grisham's writing. The characters offer an interesting mix, giving the reader a great sampling of both mannerisms and characteristics that complement one another at times and clash at moments to offer some dramatic flavour to the story. One might say that the characters are a lot softer than Grisham usually presents, but the genre might play into that, alongside the intended audience. The plot and setting are also a much softer, transitioning from the rough and tumble heist at the beginning to the oceanfront setting of Florida, where the breeze and sand denote a more peaceful place for the book to develop. One also has a feel of more romance and emotional discovery in this book, where the reader is subjected to Mercer's inner turmoil and portions of her self-discovery as she grows closer to the man she is supposed to betray. Its structure also left me a little baffled, choosing 'chapters' in what are surely part divisions and then chopping up the chapters into enumerated pieces, clearly of the usual chapter variety. I will admit that the book was well-crafted and kept the story moving forward, but I feel it tapped too much into sentimentality and the development of the author's process than gritty legal battles and a dark exploration of the criminal element, which better suits Grisham as an author and my enjoyment of his stories. This book will surely create a stir, both good and bad, for the vast number of Grisham fans. I am happy to have offered my five Canadian cents and will watch as things transpire. Kudos, Mr. Grisham for another interesting novel. While it was not my favourite, your versatility shines through by penning this piece. I am eager to see how it is received. Like/hate the review?

I was intrigued because the story is a departure from Grisham's usual legal thrillers. The plot is that priceless manuscripts by F. Scott Fitzgerald were stolen from a Princeton library, and the hunt is on to catch the thieves and save the papers.The novel starts off with a thrill as we watch the gang of thieves go about the heist. (As a librarian and also as someone who wants literary archives to be protected, I liked that Grisham completely made up the details of the theft and didn't base it on the real library layout, because he didn't want anyone trying to imitate the crime in real life.) After the Fitzgerald manuscripts are stolen, we watch the police and FBI work the case, but when the trail goes cold, investigators decide to send in someone undercover.Enter Mercer, an aspiring novelist who is tasked with infiltrating the social world of Bruce Cable, a bookseller in Camino Island, Florida, who is suspected of purchasing the stolen manuscripts. Mercer meets Bruce and some other writers in the area, and I really enjoyed the literary discussions they had. I won't spoil the ending of the mystery, but I was satisfied with how the plot was resolved.I enjoy reading books about books, so it was fitting that I liked this literary mystery so much. The dialogue is a bit on the nose at times, but I enjoyed this novel so much that it seems silly to quibble. Recommend for those who like bookish thrillers.Favorite Quotes\"Some writers are seasoned raconteurs with an endless supply of stories and quips and one-liners. Others are reclusive and introverted souls who labor in their solitary worlds and struggle to mix and mingle. Mercer was somewhere in between.\"\"Writers are generally split into two camps: those who carefully outline their stories and know the ending before they begin, and those who refuse to do so upon the theory that once a character is created he or she will do something interesting.\"\"Why do writers suffer so much? / ... It's because the writing life is so undisciplined. There's no boss, no supervisor, no time clock to punch or hours to keep. Write in the morning, write at night. Drink when you want to.\"\"Cable's Rules For Writing Fiction, a brilliant how-to guide put together by an expert who's read over four thousand books ... I hate prologues. I just finished a novel by a guy who's touring and will stop by next week. He always starts every book with the typical prologue, something dramatic like a killer stalking a woman or a dead body, then will leave the reader hanging, go to chapter 1, which, of course, has nothing to do with the prologue, then go to chapter 2, which, of course, has nothing to do with either chapter 1 or the prologue, then after about thirty pages slam the reader back to the action in the prologue, which by then has been forgotten ... Another rookie mistake is to introduce twenty characters in the first chapter. Five's enough and won't confuse your reader. Next, if you feel the need to go to the thesaurus, look for a word with three syllables or fewer. I have a nice vocabulary and nothing ticks me off more than a writer showing off with big words I've never seen before. Next, please use quotation marks with dialogue; otherwise it's bewildering. Rule Number Five: Most writers say too much, so always look for things to cut, like throwaway sentences and unnecessary scenes.\"\"There should be a rule in publishing that debut novels are limited to three hundred pages, don't you think?\""}, {"userName": "j e w e l s [Books Bejeweled]", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68216634-j-e-w-e-l-s-books-bejeweled", "userReview": "I know it's been a few (several?) years since I read Grisham, but, my gosh, he has changed! Often accused of cranking out legal thrillers and following a specific formula, maybe he wanted to depart to a simpler, softer, more feminine style. If that was his intention, he succeeded!I found the subject matter very entertaining, otherwise I probably would not have finished it. The \"mystery\" not much of a mystery at all revolves around some stolen manuscripts that are worth millions in the literary world. The reader gets to learn a bit about the black market as we follow the actual theft of F. Scott Fitzgerald's original Gatsby manuscript from Princeton University. We follow the stolen papers and see how they eventually end up on Camino Island, Florida, in the hands of Bruce Cable, a local bookstore owner.The story is light and entertaining IF you are interested in writing or literary history. Grisham provides tons of anecdotes about Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and others. He also has definite opinions on what makes a good book! He has a list of bulletpoints for anyone attempting to write fiction and it is really funny and spot on.The setting is beautiful and tropical and the writing is just as easy, breezy as you please. No hard hitting legalese to be found. A few interesting tidbits about FBI technological advances, but that's about it in the way of any procedural information. So, no cops or lawyers to speak of, just one English teacher/writer who goes undercover to try and bring down Bruce Cable. I wasn't a big fan of our girl, Mercer Mann. She thought she was so good at this spying job she fell into and she comes across as incredibly naive with a big ego at the same time. Weird. Hard to relate to or root for.I found Bruce very interesting and wish there was more of his story.I also could have done without all the romance stuff-ick. Romance in a Grisham novel? What's the world coming to??The story is going along and all of a sudden, it's epilogue time and all over. It truly feels cut short and too abrupt. This could be a nice short book for the plane or the beach. But, only if you go in knowing there isn't a mystery or any \"thriller\" scenes typically found in a Grisham novel."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "I enjoyed this more than some other recent John Grisham novels I have read. Many parts of it were 3 stars and many parts were 4 stars. I will compromise at 3.5 stars (but round up to 4 on the official scale \u2013 since I have been so harsh on Grisham lately!)The main appeal of this book is that books are central to the theme. Hardcore readers \u2013 which most of you probably are \u2013 will appreciate the discussion of bookstore business/politics, book values, first edition collecting, and book heists. All of that was what kept me in this right up to the very end.The story was just okay \u2013 some of the plot points convenient and convoluted. It is fiction, so of course the author is making it up, but I want there to be at least some sense that the events are plausible. In this case, it seemed like any time Grisham wanted something to fit he would be like, \u201cWell, it just so happens that over here is the exact thing we were discussing!\u201d It\u2019s a bit silly, but only mildly distracting.One thing I liked a lot compared to Grisham\u2019s recent efforts is that it felt fresh and unique. Normally, it feels like he is using the same formula and it is getting stale. But, in this case the mystery was different than anything I have seen in one of his books before.Finally, I go back to one of the things that amuses me about Grisham the most. I feel like he plans his plot and scenes around food. I dare you to try and find a Grisham where he doesn\u2019t mention what people are eating every few pages, characters are not planning a get together based around food, or the main character doesn\u2019t stop of somewhere for beer and burgers to contemplate what just happened.

His style is compact, direct and to the point, and pulls you in immediately. I wasn\u2019t 10 pages into his new book \u201cCamino Island\u201d and I knew that I would be spending most of the day focused on reading it. The good news is that it was worth it.Rather than focusing on lawyers, it takes aim at the world of bookstores, publishing, and writers. It begins with a skillful heist of five John F. Fitzgerald manuscripts from a secure vault below Princeton\u2019s Firestone Library. The manuscripts end up in a secondary black market and a young female writer, Mercer Mann, is hired to go undercover an investigate a popular independent bookstore owner and prominent dealer in rare books that is thought to have or know who is in possession of the manuscripts. Using a background that is second nature to Grisham works well and provides interesting tidbits and name dropping throughout the book. As usual, Mercer is in over her head and the reader is right there with her. The plot develops fast and flows well. His prose is easy to read and take in as the pages meld together in a character driven adventure that captures your attention. Even though this book is one of his shorter ones (just under 300 pages), it is well worth the time. Overall, Grisham knows how to tell a story that readers enjoy. I especially appreciated his respectful name dropping of Stephen King, support for independent bookstores, a nice small shot at Amazon. The question to ask myself is whether I ever really read a bad Grisham book? Although some are better than others, the answer is no. All of them have been good, better, or best. If you\u2019re honest, you are probably nodding your head right now. \u201cCamino Island\u201d is one of the better ones.

Almost zero suspense. Absolutely zero \"thrills\". The ending was phoned in. If you want an extremely gentle ride through the soporific world of book authors then it will be good I suppose. Otherwise grab a different Grisham book (I'm a huge fan by the way).To be fair I think Grisham was indeed trying for \"something different\". He succeeded.

The writing is very matter-of-fact - nothing very thrilling or exciting - that begins with the theft of five one-of-a-kind F. Scott Fitzgerald manuscripts from the bowels of the Princeton University Firestone Library. From there, it follows the day-to-day (often minute-by-minute) lives of the thieves and those who want to find them and bring the manuscripts back to their rightful home. It's divided into sections, each of which details the relevant characters and events pretty much on a minute-by-minute basis.\"The Heist,\" the opening section, brings readers an up-close-and-personal look at the robbers and how they planned the job and carried off the loot. \"The Dealer\" focuses on Bruce Cable, owner of a popular bookstore on Florida's Camino Island who collects rare books and, despite having a gorgeous French wife who deals in antiques, is quite the ladies' man. That's followed by \"The Recruit,\" which introduces Mercer Mann, a semi-successful novelist and current teacher at the University of North Carolina. She's desperately trying to get out of a writing slump, hoping to get published and sell enough books to pay off her massive student loans and live the life of a successful writer.In earlier days, Mercer was a frequent visitor to Camino Island and thus is familiar with its small tourist town of Santa Rosa, where Bruce's bookstore is located. When powers-that-be suspect that Bruce somehow may be involved in the theft of the manuscripts, which are insured for a whopping $25 million, she's considered the perfect \"spy\" and is offered the job of getting close enough to Bruce to learn his secrets. What they're willing to pay for her services is mind-boggling; but she wonders if its worth selling her soul as a snitch. Even if she can get over that hump, does she have what it takes to convince Bruce that she's just a curious, temporary island resident who has an interest in old books? And what if it turns out that Bruce has no secrets at all?From there, the story unfolds bit by bit, section by section - always in a mostly narrative, little dialogue fashion. For readers, that means no nail-biting or edge-of-seat balancing, which may not sit all that well with those who demand knock-'em-dead action (nor will, perhaps, the lack of courtroom drama). But as with any writer worth his or her salt, the devil is in the details - and in that respect, Grisham is as good as it gets. It was fascinating to see how deftly he weaves together all the bits and pieces into the whole story that builds to the ending - which, as might be expected, is understated as well.

The FBI is called in and despite a promising start the ring leader and manuscripts disappear.Bruce Cable owns a bookstore in the small resort town of Santa Rosa on Camino Island in Florida. He loves the business and especially loves rare books and first editions. Few people know he also deals in the black market of stolen books and manuscripts. He has done very well and authors often stop by his store on book tours.Mercer Mann has recently been laid off from her teaching position at a North Carolina college. She has written one novel, which did well, and a collection of short stories but is suffering from a severe case of writer\u2019s block. She also has student loan debts which are difficult to pay off when employed. Just in time she is approached by a mysterious woman working for an even more mysterious company. A generous offer of money and having her student debt paid off convinces Mercer to go undercover and get close to Bruce Cable. Close enough to him to learn his secrets. It seems Mercer spent summers during her childhood with her grandmother at a cottage on Camino Island. The cottage is still in the family and Mercer will go there to write a new, long overdue, novel.The ringleader in the theft from Princeton was never caught. It would appear that he made a quick deal to sell the stolen manuscripts but suddenly he is back. And wants the manuscripts.

Scott Fitzgerald's novels. They are housed in the basement under a veil of security, but not enough to stop a band of clever thieves from breaking in and stealing them. This sets loose a chain of events and angers both the FBI, who is trying to track down the criminals, and the insurance company, as they are on the hook for $25 million unless the manuscripts are returned. Meanwhile, on touristy Camino Island, Bruce Cable runs a popular bookstore/coffee shop. Thanks to a lot of persistence and hard work, he's managed to keep it profitable even in the digital age. He's also a major backer of the many authors who come through his town on book tours. But few of those authors, or Bruce's patrons, know that Bruce keeps a vault in his shop housing a variety of rare books and manuscripts--some stolen. Finally, we turn to Mercer Mann--Mercer's just lost her teaching position, and she's three years overdue on delivering her next book to her publisher. She's also drowning in student loans. Mercer's approached by a beautiful and elegant woman who offers her a lot of money to get close to Bruce Cable and learn all about his web of secrets. Trouble, as you may guess, ensues. I have a soft spot for Grisham, that's for sure. I fell in love with his first novels as a young teen, and I still love Darby Shaw, Gray Grantham, Mark Sway, Reverend Roy, and Reggie Love as if they were real people. Grisham and his family have a home in my town, and we claim him as one of our own. His books are often an easy escape, and CAMINO ISLAND falls into that category. Is it as memorable as The Pelican Brief or The Client? No. Is it a fun diversion for a few days? Sure. CAMINO ISLAND is a change from most of Grisham's legal thrillers--there are no lawyers or court room scenes here, just some tricky criminals, a heist, and the aftermath. You'll need to keep track of the various bad guys in the beginning, but once you get past that, it's an easy breezy read--much like the Florida setting where most of the novel is set. Mercer's a pleasant, albeit not very complicated protagonist, and Bruce Cable is a trip. It's also a detailed exploration into the world of rare books--something I knew little to nothing about. Overall, this is fun, easy thriller. There are a few twists and turns along the way to keep you interested, and Grisham's characters are always enjoyable. The ending wraps up fairly quickly after all the build-up, so be prepared for that. Is it Grisham's best? No. But it will keep you entertained for a couple of days. 3.5 stars.

He is one of my favorite authors. I especially like his attorney/crime novels, however this particular book is not status quo. This book does contain a crime - but no court room and the criminals, prisoners and attorneys are mentioned briefly. I am not a fan of most of Grisham's non-legal novels, however I did enjoy this one. It seems that crime does sometimes pay. The theft of some originals manuscripts written by F. Scott Fitzgerald are stolen out the locked vault at the Princeton University Firestone Library. A young novelist goes under cover in an attempt to recover the lost manuscripts, which have fallen into the hands of a charming charismatic book shop owner."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this Grisham novel. I listened to the audio and the narrator did a fabulous job which only increased my enjoyment. So if the page version is not working for you, try the audio.I particularly liked the ending. Any other ending I think would have punctured the whole story. There were so many things to like about this one: the dialogue, the characters and their development, the setting, and the story line. This was all woven together nicely.

I loved the plot centering on the heist of first edition manuscripts by Fitzgerald. I believe a lot of readers will like the literary history but if you\u2019re looking for the Grisham legal thriller then you might want to look further. This is more adult fiction than legal thriller. My quick and simple overall: entertaining and a change from the legal thrillers. Grisham is the type of author who has the ability to write different things so obviously it is still pretty good."}, {"userName": "Sandra Humphreys", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20008631-sandra-humphreys", "userReview": "Very disappointed in this book. Doesn't come close to being as good as any of his other books. It seemed as I was reading a book by someone posing as Grisham. Character development was poor at best.

This time Mr Grisham tackles the theft of the F. Scott Fitzgerald manuscripts from the Firestone Library at Princeton University. It pits the FBI, the insurance company, and others against the thieves and the book dealer who winds up with the stolen manuscripts. Good fun is achieved as we read of the interplay between a very clever book dealer, his wife, authors, and other residents of Camino Island where the bulk of the action takes place."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24360539-thomas", "userReview": "4*This is a stand alone by the author and not a legal mystery. The first 80 pages or so set up the plot. Chapter 1 is about a theft of 5 original F. Scott Fitzgerald manuscripts from Princeton University.Chapter 2 is about a bookstore owner, Bruce Cable, on Camino Island, Florida, near Jacksonville. Chapter 3, titled \"The Recruit\" is about an unemployed writer, Mercer Mann, recruited by a representative of the insurance company that is on the hook for $25 million. They want Mercer to go to Camino Island and get close to Bruce and find out if he has the stolen manuscripts. They offer her a $100,000. She says no, but when they offer to pay off her student debt, now$60,000, she agrees.Some other players:Denny, one of the thieves, a cold blooded killerNoelle, Bruce's wife. She and Bruce have an open marriage.I liked the way the plot unfolded and thought the characters were believable and well written. I didn't expect the ending, but I liked it. My wife didn't like the ending and thought the first part of the book was too slow.One quote, describing a local eccentric author's house: \"In the air there was a less than pleasant odor of what seemed to be a mix of stale cigarette smoke and dirty dogs. The furniture was old flea market stuff, but quirky and engaging.\"Thanks to Doubleday for sending me this book through the Goodreads giveaway program."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean", "userReview": "John Grisham totally changed his writing content and style in his new book. The story opened with the robbery of five manuscripts of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s novels from a high-security vault at Princeton University. The manuscripts are valued at twenty-five million dollars. The FBI\u2019s Rare Asset Recovery Unit made a couple of arrests and then the investigation stalled. A rare asset retrieval company recruited Mercer Mann, a struggling writer, to go in as a mole to their prime suspects, Bruce Kable\u2019s, new and rare bookstore on Camino Island.The book is well written and the suspense builds throughout the story. The story is more of a cat-and-mouse type of tale. I am impressed with how Grisham ties his various plot threads together. This book is about writing, independent publishing, independent bookstores and the theft of rare books. How could I, an avid reader, not like the book.I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. The book is almost nine hours long. January LaVoy does a good job narrating the book. LaVoy is a well-known actress and audiobook narrator. I had problem deciding on rating. Would be a 3.5 but there is no half available."}], "description": "A gang of thieves stage a daring heist from a secure vault deep below Princeton University\u2019s Firestone Library.
