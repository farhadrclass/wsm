However, I now find myself doing the same thing quite a bit, when I see the world turning into something I don't recognize anymore. The public's overblown fascination with the rich and famous. The huge amount of people famous for nothing. The media stirring up hatred and anger against \"the accused of the week\". People camping out on people's lawns with signs- spewing hurtful words, accusations and death threats- before, during, and after a trial. Cameras in the courtroom. Couch potato sleuths. Talking head \"experts\" getting into the mind of the \"guilty\". The news anchors reporting the \"news\" without knowing the facts first, and issuing an \"apology\" when they get it wrong....Alllllll these things make me utter the phrase- \"When I was yooooooung....\". I miss REAL news coverage. I miss Walter Cronkite. I miss Peter Jennings. I miss Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News. Sometimes...I miss the olden days.Former \"It Girl\" Janie Jenkins is released from prison- after serving ten years of a life sentence for the brutal murder of her mother- Swiss American socialite, Marion Jenkins-Elsinger.Although her sentence was overturned due to mismanagement of evidence in the LAPD crime lab- not everyone agrees with the judges decision. Most people think Ms. Jenkins has gotten away with murder. And the media is not going to let this story fade into the background....but Janie does have one person in her corner. Her Lawyer- Noah Washington thinks she is innocent, and is determined to help her in every way he knows how- and right now, that means providing her with a new identity and a safe haven in Wisconsin until things die down.So with a dye job, a snip of the scissors, her brand new dowdy wardrobe, and an attitude adjustment- \"It Girl\" Jane \"Janie\" Jenkins- becomes the ordinary- Rebecca Parker. And Janie/Rebecca has no intention of sitting back and waiting...She has no plans to travel to Wisconsin- or of letting Noah know where she is going and why...Janie wants to prove her innocence- and she has one piece of information that she has kept a secret from everyone- even Noah.I was over the moon when I was approved for Elizabeth Little's debut novel- DEAR DAUGHTER...and so when it began with a quote from Paris Hilton...I was a taaaaaaaad worried that this wasn't going to be my cup-o-tea- but after reading the opening paragraph- I was hooked, and knew I was going to fall in luuuuuuuv with Janie- my new BFF.Thanks NetGalley! :)"}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "Multi-tools are like insults, girls\u2014you should always have one on handyou're not going to like this narrator. and you're not meant to. the author knows what she's doing - walking that popular gillian flynn female-antihero line, and the narrator herself would definitely not like you, so all's fair. this book is definitely a good readalike for flynn-fans, although it has a slightly less nihilistic edge, and less colorful violence. it's about a firecracker of a girl named jane, raised in flamboyant, isolated wealth and kept at an emotional arms-length by her elegant and dignified mother. she grows into beautiful, bitter, controlling young adulthood, all \"fuck-you\" fa\u00e7ade and calculating manipulation, as self-destructive as she is tightly self-controlled, careening through life on a mission to get what she wants and embarrass her mother while getting it. There are those for whom recklessness is a state of abandon. Of thoughtlessness. Of a conscious decision to ignore repercussions and eventualities. And I bet it's liberating for them, like spinning in circles and falling to the ground. But that's not me. My recklessness was a demonstration of restraint. I spun in circles to prove I could walk a straight line after.when jane is seventeen, her mother is violently murdered in their home, and all signs seem to point to jane being her killer. she has no memory of the night of the crime, but the evidence puts her in jail for ten years, until some evidentiary mismanagement in her case comes to light and she is released into the world once more, part trembly-legged fawn, part long-suppressed wolverine.I'm sure there are those for whom getting out of prison is a whole, like, Beethoven's Ninth sort of thing. Rousing, joyous, accompanied by a choir. But for me - for most of us, I'd guess - it was more like Beethoven's Fifth. We're too busy being taken aback the the sheer size and scope of things to do anything but lose our minds a little, like the first time you go to a grocery store and realize there's more than one kind of Wheat Thin.with the help of her devoted lawyer noah, jane assumes a new identity, rebeccca parker, in order to shield her from the virulent media attention. she has become a target, a pariah, and serious tabloid-bait, so she takes flight, leaving noah in the dark as she travels to the smallest of small towns in south dakota on a hunch and a half memory from the night of the murder, determined to find out the secrets of her mother's past, what really happened that night, and if she actually was responsible. you will occasionally roll your eyes at jane's voice. i certainly did. she has this uncanny knack of taking the snark one or two steps too far. she will unleash something deadly funny and then just. keep. going. until the funny gets overridden by easy sarcasm and you're like \"dayyum, girl - quit while you're ahead!\"If I'd been free to pick any name in the world, I would have gone for something diaphanous and fanciful, like Coralie or Delphine, the kind of name a grande dame gives a petit chien. Because no one - no one - daydreams about pretty names more than girls called Jane. And with good reason, you know? I mean, even our most illustrious Janes are world-class sticks-in-the-mud. Austen, Eyre, Doe? Spinster, sucker, corpse. It's a wonder I managed as well as I did.(Although at least Jane is reasonably dignified. When I was arrested the tabloids decided to call me Janie, and ever since everyone else has followed suit. Like I needed another reason to hate Aerosmith.)andRebecca Parker, I decided, received her B.A. in Old Stuff About America from the University of A State That Grows Corn. Her undergraduate thesis, \"Something Something Gold Rush: Something Something Nineteenth-Century,\" won a departmental thesis prize. Her work has been published in impressive journals no layperson would have heard of, like Tedious Details About the Dakotas, and Undersexed Antisocial Nerds Discuss Cowboys. She has frequently presented at major conventions hosted by associations with \"history\" in their names. Her current research interests include pioneer somethings and American Indian something elses. Ask her about any of this and you will be so crazy bored that you would rather self-lobotomize than ask a follow-up. (But I made a few flashcards and wrote a short paper on nineteenth-century settlement patterns just in case you're not.)but sometimes she makes colorfully astute assessments of others, particularly when it comes to repellently predatory menHis arms were lean and muscled and covered in a thicket of tattoos he'd probably copied from a mixed-martial-arts magazine.He smirked as he approached, and I noticed that his eyes weren't just undressing Renee. They were recording her with night-vision video and posting it on the Internet.andMitch's good looks were thoroughly nouveau-riche, from his oversized dive watch to his Just for Men hair. He wore the khaki pants and polo shirt of the kind of man who'd carry your groceries out to your car before sexually assaulting you. Every time he shook someone's hand, a part of him probably mourned the fist bump that might have been.and i did actually laugh out loud twice while reading this book. once for something that will make no sense out of context, but also this:I found the first police blotterFebruary 26, 198210:37 pm Caller on Tesmond Road reported that someone had rung doorbell but had not been there when the door was answered.Well, this was pretty fucking promising.gotta love small towns, right?it's a riveting story with all the best elements of psychological suspense, smalltown crime stories, and family secrets tied together by the unforgettable, occasionally irritating voice of jane. it's not the most flawless of all mysteries - at the end there's some \"but, waits,\" some unrealistic tidiness, and some character-softening that ms. flynn would never have bothered with, but it's a genuinely propulsive page-turner and a fantastic debut.and sometimes, it's uncanny:You can probably guess that I didn't spend much time around other kids when I was growing up, but before you start to feel sorry for me, let me assure you that even if my mother hadn't insisted, I wouldn't have had it any other way. I never understand it when parents talk about sending their kids to school to \"socialize\" them. Children aren't people. They're barely even animals. They're just suppurating woulds of emotion inflamed by too much positive reinforcement. You can't be socialized by the unsocializable.

There will be spoilers ahead, but read my review anyway. This book isn't worth your time anyway, so you might as well hear about the plot. The Summary: Jane Jenkins has just been released from prison; Not because she is innocent, but because of some mishandling of crucial evidence. After being imprisoned for 10 years, Jenkins has no family to turn to... especially because the person whose murder she was accused of was her mother's (GASP). Jenkins sets out to find the truth. My Problems with this Novel: The Narrator: Jenkins is described in a blurb by Tana French as being 'smart', 'damaged', and 'unstoppable' with a 'slicing sense of humor'. MY ASS. The narrator is bitchy, annoying, and shallow, and besides knowing that I hated her, I really knew nothing else. It's hard to get to know the narrator, because instead of normal thoughts or introspective scenes or dialogue, we're simply treated to Jane's un-amusing and bitchy inner dialogue that is rarely funny and only serves to move the plot along. The majority of the novel is Jane's limp, shallow inner dialogue, and maybe this wouldn't be so terrible if the plot didn't crawl along at the pace of lifeless snail. Page after page of boring incidents, forgettable characters, and Jenkins terrible innermost thoughts put me to sleep. I would often \"read\" 2 pages, realize I had simply skimmed them while daydreaming, and then have to re-read them so I could actually comprehend what was going on. And let me tell you about the peak of my hatred for Jane Jenkins. Near the end, Jenkins is shot in the shoulder by her mother's murderer. Instead of screaming, crying, or doing anything rational or realistic, Jenkins makes a comment out-loud about how red isn't her color. Seriously woman? You got shot in the shoulder, you're trapped in a fatal corner by your enemy, and you're gonna make a shallow comment about how the color of blood doesn't look good on you? I laughed. This was the ending and I almost freaking put this book down because I was so mortified. The Plot: The plot is  UNBEARABLY  slow, and horrendously boring. The audience is treated to a lackluster and pointless murder mystery that brings no satisfaction. The author uses audio files, interviews, emails, and news reports between chapters to add drama, but this concept is old and rarely brings anything exciting to the table. There are 2 big reveals, and neither of them shock or even feel satisfying. The bigger reveal is Jane's mother's murderer, and this reveal comes out of the blue with a minor character that you don't know or care about. Because he's a minor character, the audience is forced to deal with a long, ridiculous confrontation between the two that feels like a James Bond skit. Jane repeatedly questions him, and he answers while pointing a gun at her and NOT KILLING HER IMMEDIATELY. Of course, this ends up being his downfall. Also, lets chat really quick about the romantic sub-plot between Jane and some random guy in town. They have nothing in common, and the author forcibly tries to create sexual tension between two completely different people. It's weird, and boring, and I think I wanted to skip these sections the most.Horrid. Find a better mystery. I only gave this half a star because of a few heartfelt moments scattered throughout, and because of a really cool little reveal about halfway through that really pinched my heartstrings."}, {"userName": "Laurel Tyndall", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7110823-laurel-tyndall", "userReview": "* I received this book as an ARC from the publisher in exchange for my honest review *Wow. I just finished this book and I've got to say... Sorry, but I was a little disappointed. The story itself is really good. I love how Jane's trying to figure out who really murdered her mother (and if she did, in fact, do it herself). But the details were less than great.***Spoilers***First: I really had the hardest time trying to even LIKE Jane. Sure, it's easy to start off feeling sorry for her because she was convicted of murdering her mother in a terribly mishandled case. And you totally root for her trying to find out where her mom came from, who her father, who really did commit the murder. But Jane herself is just - not personable (that's the best way I can describe it.)Second: You never really get to know any of the other characters. It's mostly \"Here: This is Leo, he's a cop, he's sort-of handsome and sort-of interesting, and he pops up at random times, and now it's time to sleep with him, and now we don't trust him, and six pages later we do trust him.\"Third: Just so many characters that seemed to be just thrown in there for kicks. I mean, they're kind of legitimate, but really unnecessary. Like Walt, who is a drug dealer/snitch/cyber hacker tech guy thing who ends up being the main guys who's leading the man hunt for Jane and then you never really hear from him again. And then the guy who robbed the bank with Jane's mom who had a super-huge super-important message for Jane from Tessa that turned out not really to matter at all.Fourth: Simply (And sorry) I hate Jane's mom. Hate her. I hate Jane's uncle. I hate Jane's half-brother. I hate Jane's cousin Rue. So many characters that you just cannot like. Some you're not meant to, and then others (Like Rue) that's you're not meant to and then all of the sudden you are because in two pages she has this complete drunken turnaround and all-of-the-sudden stops being a bratty teenager while she's at a keg party that makes no sense.Lastly: The ending. I had two words when I closed this book. Wow and Ouch. (And not a good wow, unfortunately.) I mean, the climax happens when she figures out who the real murderer is, everything seems to be very-nearly resolved, and two pages later - Jane's back in jail for killing the murderer. It was just - such a let down. Over six hundred pages of her trying so hard to clear her name and she's right back where she started. I hate to sound cruel since I know authors put such hard work into their books - but after those last two pages, the six hundred pages of story before them just seemed like a waste of time.Again - I really liked the premise of this book. It sounded so exciting. But it was just such a let down, and pretty depressing. It just felt like there were about a hundred other books waiting next to my bed for me to read that would be far, FAR better."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5537205-robert", "userReview": "When you slack off for a few days and seek praise in your own writing, bad things tend to happen. With me, my memory went to shit on a stick. So (like Will Ferrell in Old School during the great debate) let me regurgitate DEAR DAUGHTER in a stream of consciousness before I\u2019m even more fucked than I already am.Janie Jenkins decided to take everything she had discovered over the course of her life\u2014before she ended up in the pokey\u2014and leave it on the side of the road. Her clothes, hair, name, and confidence\u2026broken like a baseball bat. Her ability to mess around until the sun goes down with a semi-famous rock star. Gone. She may have been tabloid fodder with her feet firmly planted in an alternate reality, even as her mom tried to pull the minivan out of the driveway. But she had more than enough intelligence to jam a crucifix in that plan, and stay in the course in that multi-horse town.With her eyes downcast, and nothing to go on but a place and a date, she seeks justice for a crime she didn\u2019t commit, even if she can\u2019t get those ten years of her life back. But she\u2019s bound and determined to even the score. Her character reminded me of a stray cat that had been kicked a little too much, and missed more meals than she received. Her mom couldn\u2019t have offered a better plug for contraceptives, although she didn\u2019t end up being a total loss.All the small town and South Dakota atmosphere needed was a six shooter, black hat, cloud of dust, and some western theme music. Yeah, the town nearly became a character in the story, and I reminisced about my brief stint in Rapid City, where the land was flat and the trees were sparse.The plot nudged along, until Elizabeth Little revved the engine and it took off near the end like a turbocharged Harley, and I nearly fell off and struck the pavement. Other than whiplash and a near brush with asphalt, I managed to keep my butt in my seat. I didn\u2019t even need to dust myself off.With that being said, I didn\u2019t like the end. It felt like I put my head through a glass door. Otherwise, though, I was good to go. If I pick up another Elizabeth Little novel, I\u2019ll just make sure I walk with my hand in front of my face.I received this book for free through NetGalley.Cross-posted at Robert's Reads"}, {"userName": "Leanne", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5873788-leanne", "userReview": "I read about Dear Daughter in some obscure article that I just tried to look for and can no longer locate \u2013 but I do remember that it referenced it as a sharp crossover mystery that would appeal to fans of Tana French and Gillian Flynn. Well, come on \u2013 is there any other combination of authors you could compare a book to that would intrigue me more? Upon further investigation, I noted that while I was by no means thrilled with the (hopefully just draft) cover (yes, I do frequently judge a book by its cover), on that cover was a fairly glowing recommendation from Tana French herself. So that scooted it up a little further on my most anticipated list. And then, mere days later, I spot it on Netgalley - it was fate! Netgalley hasn't always loved me in the past, but I have chosen to temporarily forgive them after they let me have this one.Jane Jenkins (known to the world as Janie) is not quite your typical LA socialite \u2013 yes, she is fabulously wealthy, and stunning, and dripping in fashion. But she's also been convicted of murdering her mother. And she's not actually sure if she's guilty or not. After being released from her 10 year stint in prison on a technicality, she heads to the twin towns of Ardelle/Adeline (based on pieces of a conversation she eavesdropped on shortly before her mother's death) to find out the truth and maybe get to know her mother a little better than she thought she did. Interspersed are various media snippets \u2013 Wikipedia entries, police transcripts, blog posts, etc. \u2013 that provide some much appreciated backstory on Jane, her mother, and the central crime.At first, I couldn't decide if the narration was more on the fun, sarcastic side, or the silly, immature side, but I've settled on fun. Jane is partially soulless, but she's also clever and blunt and witty, and by no means a damsel in distress. And it was almost refreshing to read a mystery that wasn't painfully dark \u2013 I love gothic, sinister tales, but it was nice to read something a bit lighter that didn't, on the other hand, feel like a cheap drugstore mystery novel. I've also said before that I love books about backwater towns, and Ardelle doesn't disappoint \u2013 it's got plenty of secrets to hide (do you think real-life small towns have this many skeletons in their closets?), and the twists, while not revolutionary, are still surprising and interesting. Really, what this novel has going for it is just pure readability. Recommended for anyone who likes a little bit of sly commentary on celebrity culture, a \"mean girl\" narrator that you still root for, or a smart murder mystery tinged with humour."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3908840-sue", "userReview": "\"Dear Daughter\" by Elizabeth Little, was chosen as our BOTM for October in one of the groups that I am a member.

The mystery! The suspense! The inevitable twists and turns in every nook and cranny! Could this be the next\u00a0Gone Girl? So, yes, I truly was excited, and jumped into this book with twitching hands, ready for my mind to be blown away....only to be sorely disappointed....and having to DNF it even before I reached the 30% mark.Now, before we all go grab our pitchforks, let it be known that it was possibly a case of a \"It's not you, it's me\". I mean, I didn't even last halfway! Who knows what was beyond that horizon, right? But for the purpose of this review, I will talk about the very things that made me want to give up this book and my dreams of finding another mystery thriller to praise highly.First off, the writing style. It's not exactly horrendous per se, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Ever met someone who keeps trying to be funny in every situation by using a dry, sarcastic, bitchy humor, only to fail miserably? Or someone who tries so hard to let everyone know they're the shit, only to find themselves yapping to kingdom come, and quite unnecessarily, as all those big words do not have any substance at the end of the day? That's pretty much the internal narration here in a nutshell, and it was so tiring to plow through page and pages of it. And, guys. Skimming so many paragraps when you've just started? BAD SIGNAL, FOLKS. VERY BAD.It's like she's trying to tell us so much of herself of her life, but because of the tone and way they were delivered, we don't really get to know her at all. They become empty words like dust in the wind.\u00a0Which brings me to my second point: the main character herself.I\u00a0do not like her. In the pages I've read, I could\u00a0not bring myself to like her. Basically, before this gal was imprisoned for allegedly killing her socialite mother, she was a social butterfly herself, often seen in A-List parties and hanging out with sizzling actors in Hollywood, stealing boyfriends and whatnot. When she got out, the aura I got from her was ungrateful, bitchy, and shallow, and she just grated on my nerves a lot.\u00a0It was hard enough to deal with the awful monologue, but to get this kind of character, too?That's like adding insult to injury.Granted, she may have been written to\u00a0be like this. Not all main characters have to be likeable in order to tell a story, and I for one understand that. In fact, I've read a lot of books lately where we see things in the perspective of the bully, but those stories still get you to connect because those stories were meant to encourage you to think outside the book and see these social issues in another light. But this one? I'm not sure that was the goal, and anything otherwise with such an unlikeable heroine is just not for me.\u00a0All of these have led me to close the book before it even finished and never look back.Don't let me discourage you, though. I'm just one voice out of many. If you're curious about this book, do check it out yourselves and see if it's something that would strike\u00a0your fancy.

I looked at my left shoulder. \u201cShit,\u201d I breathed. \u201cRed is so not my color.\u201d  Loc4640 Jane seriously does not know when to quit it.The plot, which is extremely slow moving and at times leaves you wondering what the hell the point is, involves criminal/mystery cliches such as: cutting/dying hair for a new \u201cidentity\u201d, police station break-in to somehow quickly find the very files you are looking for, decades old diary that breaks the case wide open found and complete strangers in a small town yapping openly about the very person the protagonist is attempting to locate. There are far more clich\u00e9s, but this is a good handful of them. There was also a very aggressive and irritating blogger that in this day and age also felt clich\u00e9, though for different reasons. Said blogger also was predictable and added nothing to the story, in my opinion. The author was also very, very fond of using obscure references which only seemed to be in order to show-off her highly thought of interests as a reader, movie and unknown (to me) furniture consumer. Unfortunately such references were to be found on, at the very least, every other page. Such as:An accent out of a Tennessee Williams play and a genetic inclination for a farmer\u2019s tan.

What she discovers there leads her deeper and deeper into what happened that night, and also who her mother really was.

A media celebrity due to her outrageous stunts, drugs and boyfriends, Jane is pretty much the epitome of everything I hate about our love affairs with celebrities who have not actually done anything to earn that title.It does get interesting though, when she sets out to find out the secrets in her mothers past. A past she knew nothing about because her mother invented her own backstory. Despite a very tenuous link, one I feel was a bit random, Jane finds herself in the black hills. Now this interested me, not many stories are set there, and I found the secrets she exposes deftly handled. The story was quick moving, after the beginning and did hold my interest. Although I did not like Jane at the beginning as the book went on she proved that she could change and I found myself rooting for her.A good book, somewhat mixed with surprises plenty and an interesting look at the culture of celebrities and the paparazzi.

To me, however, it's ended up being a good effort riddled with missed opportunities, though not without its merits.Jane Jenkins was sixteen years old when she was convicted of her mother's brutal murder. 83% of America believes her to be guilty yet after spending a decade in solitary she gets out on a technicality. Jane's narrative is dominated by quick judgements on her part of other people, insights into a person's mind that can come of spending either decades manipulating others while under the effects of the public eye, or a psychology degree from a top-notch(or really crappy) institution.She was just thin enough to let you know she gave a shit, like she probably shaved her bush every once in a while, but she wasn't so thin that she could be exacting about things like coming during sex. She was a lazy man's woman. A rainy day in the dark kind of woman.While it instantly(and surely) clears up any lingering ennui on the part of the reader, and although Jane Jenkins made her notorious debut when she was fifteen, I find it a little hard to accept such statements of a woman who spent only two years in the limelight, sharpening her talons when she was but in her mid-teens, and afterwards, spent her years with minimal interactions. Jaded as life with her mother might have caused her to become, this level of certainty and perceptiveness I find hard to accept.Beyond that, however, Jane's self-aware yet narcissistic personality, along with her cultivated affectations and idiolect were easily traced back, and attributed to, her unusual upbringing. Often a time, she reverts back to speaking in far-fetched metaphors, or thinking in terms too histrionic* but always redeems herself by calling on it. That said, what settled the 3-star rating for me was the decided lack of tension or atmosphere in the setting. Factoring out the main character, or maybe just her history, and Dear Daughter could make a cozy mystery with minimal to no humor. In fact, it's the itty-bitty bits from Jane's past that give it the little dark edge it has, until the last of revelations. On the other hand, it certainly was an all-nighter. I stayed awake till 5 am.As a corollary to above, I must add that the buildup doesn't pan out. We're led to believe there's this deep secret that might be surrounding Ardelle, looks exchanged and selfish deeds, which when revealed turns out to be agonizingly innocuous. Moreover, with the exception of the obvious because reasons and villains, the people of Ardelle turn out to be supremely helpful for no reason other than well, they're NICE. That was a huge blow, considering all that we'd seen and derived of Jane's mother from her actions as well as Jane's memories, and Jane herself along with all the people she'd associated with before striking out on this quest of hers- they were twisted. And these were disappointingly nice. Lastly, one of the things that is bugging me the most is Jane's own lack of certainty as to whether she killed her mother. I do understand that ten years of incarceration put her in a fragile state but she wasn't sure whether she was guilty from the beginning, or at least that's how it was purported, IMO. It was never ascertained why.I did like the conclusion of the story, open-ended in some areas. Neither was the book itself all that bad- Jane's voice(despite my objections) was engrossing and there was never a hint of boredom throughout. The writing was captivating courtesy to/despite insights such as these:You step into the elevator, of course. Because you don't want to judge him unfairly just because he's big or because he looks different or because he's wearing a chain wallet. You overrule the animal inside you that's screaming danger danger danger because you don't want to feel bad. You talk yourself out of your animal instincts because you want to feel empowered, because you want to feel noble.But truth: Never once when I've done this have I felt empowered. Never once have I felt noble. I've only ever felt lucky to still be there when the door opens again. Because you know who's the only kind of who doesn't feel bad? A dead one.And yet, each and every time I step into that elevator. Otherwise I never would've come to Ardelle to begin with. *I call it the John Green Syndrome.

I read this novel for a group read for one of my Goodreads mystery groups. If I was just reading it on my own, I would have given up on it, something I have only done once in the last year. The first 50% of the book was tough to get through. The book is written in first person narrative with the protagonist, assumed murderess Jane Jenkins, being the voice of the story. Jane was not likable at all, so the fact that she was the narrator made things even more difficult. None of the supporting characters were likable either. There was NOBODY to like. And I like to like the characters. I gave the first half of the book 2 stars. Why not 1 star? The saving graces were the sarcastic comments, often self-deprecating, of the protagonist which I rather enjoyed, and the cool texts/newspaper excerpts which appeared at the end of most of the chapters. I thought this feature was quite clever.Finally, at about the 50% mark, things picked up. The mystery got much more interesting, and the characters started to flesh out. I was actually looking forward to reading time so I could rejoin these people and see how the story played out. By the end, I was cheering Jane on and feeling fuzzes for several of the other characters. The end was not Hollywood, and certainly believable. This part of the book earned 4 stars from me. 2 +4 divided by 2 = 3 star read.I am glad I persevered with Dear Daughter. Will I read anything else Ms. Little writes in the future (this was her debut novel)? I probably will as I did end up liking this book and am curious to see what else she comes up with, but I hope it will not take as long to become involved with the characters.

The Books section of the paper, on-line reviewers, my local library website, my fellow readers here at Goodreads: they all recommended it as a terrific thriller. Did they read the same book I did? I was so disappointed.The basic premise was good, if not overly original. Janie Jenkins is released from prison on a technicality, after serving 10 years for killing her mother. She decides to find out what really happened. So far, so humdrum. The author tried to introduce some original style devices, such as inserting news flashes and old bits of the original investigation transcripts, but it doesn't add to the suspense.Janie's voice itself is part of the problem. Her smart-ass inner dialogue doesn't make her look clever, it just makes her look like a sociopath. It seems completely improbable that she would wiggle her way into the affections of Kelley, Renee, Rue and Leo so quickly, when they have every logical reason to be very guarded and careful around strangers coming to their little town. Even the idea of a festival in North Dakota in November is ridiculous. November???

Superb and sublime writing.What's the book about then?You might fight with your mother, Janie Jenkins might have killed hers.'As soon as they processed my release Noah and I hit the ground running. A change of clothes. A wig. An inconspicuous sedan. We doubled back once, twice, then drove south when we were really headed east. In San Francisco we had a girl who looked like me board a plane to Hawaii.Oh, I thought I was so clever.But you probably already know that I\u2019m not.'My Review:Janie Jenkins has been in prison for a long time, charged with the murder of her rich and glamorous mother. Janie is somewhat of a socialite and celebrity in her own right. We get plummeted straight into wondering about whether or not Janie did indeed kill her Mother, or not? Janie herself is not too sure either, and this is where the fun begins.It's very hard to review this book without spoilers as really the ENTIRE book is a large reveal, bit by bit, word by word, person by person. After eventually being released from prison Janie decides to avoid the paparazzi and her haters by placing decoys to have the trail run cold on where she is really going and she instead arrives and indeed plants herself in a small town in the USA of which she had found the name of amongst her Mother's items. Her Mother was a fantastic hoarder of secrets. Janie is curious. She really has no idea what she has got herself into (yet).With strong focus on the characters that Janie meets in this small town and an emphasis on the relationship dynamics she observes and has, her own thoughts and feelings, the book immerses us in a psychological world where frustratingly you know you SHOULD be seeing more but you can't. It's so subtle and clever, interwoven mystery with everyday life. I loved the humour, slightly offbeat at times that runs through this book, whilst not a light read in it's subject matter, Elizabeth Little brings another aspect forward in this clever, multi-layered novel.His convict wear was olde-timey, a loose jumpsuit striped in white and gray. \"County Jail\" was printed on his chest in Dior Rouge No. 9. I felt a moment's pique. This jumpsuit would've been way nicer with my complexion's yellow undertones than the traffic-cone orange I'd been stuck wearing.Janie is moving around incognito, hoping to not be recognised as the killer the public loves to hate. It's great seeing different \"real\" and \"pretend\" parts of her personality come forth, even better that we know what's going on in her head really. It's just others don't.I was reading and often wondering where it was all heading, but not bored for one second, holding on page after page just wanting to know whatever it was that Janie had to know. Wanting to know the truth too. It's not a book that shows it's hand quickly, it's slowly revealed, card by card until it's game over for the player. By the dynamic grand finale I was excited, I was breathing in the atmosphere and right there in the moment. Then I was like \"What? Can't be? Who does that? Why?\" but you know what? I didn't care, I just did not care. I just enjoyed the ride. There are some exceptional characters in this novel, each portrayed as multi-faceted at times, some very much left me in a love/hate situation, including Janie herself at times. She was an enigma, could not quite pin her down. But that's the whole idea. Clever, very clever.A great read, highly recommended. A touch of crime, a touch of mystery, some clever story telling, an atmospheric setting, and an outcome that you won't see coming.

Words that landed Janie in jail for ten long years and have the entire world convinced of her guilt. Janie is out now, released due to mishandling of evidence in her case. And she is determined to get to the bottom of it all. She has a long journey ahead of her, with lots of digging to do, and she will not like what she's about to learn about her mother, her past, and herself.  Dear Daughter is all around lean and mean, stylish and deftly written. It's a solid and dramatic thriller for anyone who enjoys a good mystery, strong female characters and sharp dialogues combined with gritty, slower-paced plots. It's a book in which the setting is just as important as the characters, the atmosphere is thick and seductive, and all the dark secrets are buried six feet under and better left undisturbed.\"Twenty-six, fabulously wealthy, and I never even finished high school\" Janie is quite a fascinating character to follow. Being a celebrity known for wild partying and shocking behavior (just like Lindsay Lohan or Paris Hilton), she's constantly flocked by paparazzi. Alcohol and drugs make her late-night escapades just a blurry memory in the morning, and she doesn't even remember everything that happened on the night of her mother's death. Truth is, she and her mother did not get along at all, but could she have actually killed her own mother? She doesn't think so, but proving her innocence is a whole different story, especially considering the fact that her name was found written in blood next to the body. She's been wronged (OK, let's face it, her own mother completely screwed her over, there's no other way of putting this) but she refuses to play the victim, she's bold, often tactless, rude and selfish. Tough and resourceful. Completely unapologetic. She swears a lot, talks back too much for her own good, has spontaneous sexual encounters with randomly picked guys (usually of the not-good-for-you, dangerous kind), and doesn't know when to back down from a fight. Is she brave or just reckless and stupid? I am still trying to decide this. One thing for sure, she is highly entertaining and I had a great time poking around in her head and learning things about her. Understand that this is how it works with people like me. Self-pity is the sun around which we orbit, the great gravitational force that rules those of us for whom Things Didn't Quite Turn Out. If we're lucky, purpose (vengeance, absolution, cookies, not in that order) can keep us from falling in, from burning up, but we're fooling ourselves if we ever think we're going to break free. The plot line is not a very fast-paced one, though I didn't mind that one bit. The narration style is extremely addictive - witty, clever, sharp, biting, sometimes genuinely funny, always honest and straight to the point - and it makes up for the lack of exciting twists in the first 3/4 of the story. The twists are there, and they are exciting, but they don't come until the last couple chapters. They're all crammed into the ending of the book. That is, perhaps, why I felt the ending was a bit too rushed and abrupt. And too explosive to be realistic. I also thought it was a bit too neat and too convenient, but I do realize that there are plenty of readers who prefer it that way. This was, overall, a really good read. Captivating and intense, it kept me reading long past my bed time. The conclusion to the story was well thought out and, though slightly vague on some details, mostly satisfying.

It felt as if the author was so worried about writing in the voice of an emotionally shuttered rich bitch that she had to throw in every cutting insight this girl could possibly have. It got to the point where my eye rolling became laughing out loud at the poor writing. Some of the relationships felt unlikely - everyone welcomed this frumpy looking stranger immediately, which felt odd. I did not enjoy the rushed ending either, it seemed as though the author was wary of a happy ending, and also as if she was planning a sequel.

In Gone Girl, for example, after faking her murder Amy tries hiding out in an isolated cabin in the Ozarks - a lone woman with a lot of cash & no weapons. She\u2019s lucky only to get robbed, & not raped & murdered as well. She should\u2019ve headed for Kansas City. In Dear Daughter it was equally stupid for Jane to exit the Amtrak @ McCook, Nebraska, & then to compound the folly by stealing a truck, which ends up utterly blowing her cover. Of course the Santa Bonita women\u2019s prison library\u2019s collection probably didn\u2019t include Tana French (who provided a referral for this one) & Harry Bingham, but Jane should nevertheless have realized it\u2019s vital when undercover to take on totally the new ID, to live it so completely that she\u2019ll always instinctively think & act as her new self would. Posing as an American history scholar (American Studies graduate student writing a thesis would have been even better - no paper trail) was the perfect cover for a stranger asking nosy questions in an old western mining town but Jane simply does not try very hard to maintain her cover & stealing the truck (& then keeping it & driving round town in it instead of setting it on fire in the boondocks) isn\u2019t the sort of thing American Studies types do.Tho\u2019 it was the theme of counterfeit identity that first drew me to read Dear Daughter, it was Jane the narrator who kept me entranced, a badass chick blending a strange & attractive mix of sophistication with vulgarity, as well as cynicism with an ingenuousness that may be the aftereffect of having spent her most formative young adult years in the slammer. We care about who killed Jane\u2019s mother, but a lot more about what happens to Jane. You\u2019re afraid of her & you're afraid for her @ the same time.The ending was perplexing @ first & some readers probably won\u2019t like it, but after some reflection it felt just right for Jane. Tho\u2019 she seems straight out of US magazine & the E! channel, a Greek tragedian would have loved to create a trilogy featuring her family, the Kantys of Adeline/Ardelle, South Dakota. She also has her own personal Fury pursuing her on the internet. Jane reminds me a lot of Electra, with her burning hatred for her mother.

A news reporter/blogger has been hounding her during her time in prison and is continuing to try and track her every move and it\u2019s down to Janie to keep one step ahead.With snatches of memory returning of that night, and armed with a new identity, Janie sets out to try and find out whether she did actually kill her own mother. She discovers that her mother had withheld a lifetime of secrets and in fact had accumulated her share of enemies over the years. I didn\u2019t really know what to make of this book - the first half of the book was a little too slow to make this a wholly enjoyable read. Recalling some vague memory from the past, Janie starts her search by heading for an old mining town called Ardelle. Some of the inhabitants of this small backwater town that Janie encounters seemed rather stereotypical \u2013 a few seemed just weird and creepy and I wasn\u2019t sure who could be trusted. Janie\u2019s interactions with them became interesting in that she had to reinvent herself in order to find out the information she needed. Being nice to people was something totally out of character for Janie.The story did pick up pace in the latter stages and kept my interest all the way through with twists that I didn\u2019t see coming. Overall this was an interesting and commendable debut thriller with a clever structure and sharp and pithy dialogue and whilst it won\u2019t be a contender for my book of the year, it turned out to be a very good read."}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5879517-beverly", "userReview": "I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review, and WOW. I think Elizabeth Little is going to be a strong voice in contemporary fiction!Former \"it\" girl Janie Jenkins has been in prison for the last ten years, convicted of killing her mother, with whom she had a tumultuous relationship. Released on a technicality, Janie goes on a mission to discover who killed her mother...even it it was herself.I had several \"NO WAY!\" moments during this novel. Little did an amazing job of keeping the reader on their toes, and the very ending was quite unexpected. I was a little unsure about the emails, court transcripts, TMZ reports, Without a Trace website updates,etc that prefaced each chapter. They seemed to break up the flow a little bit. However, I don't think the very end would have been as powerful had they not been used."}], "description": "As soon as they processed my release Noah and I hit the ground running.
