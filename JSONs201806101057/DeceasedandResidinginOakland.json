The result is a world-building exercise that depicts a thorough and convincing city of high-density, multi-purpose buildings, Frankenstein cars and an economy based on dark entertainments and goods retrieved from the suburbs by daredevil privateers.Author Philip James makes no effort to hide his admiration for preceding pulp greats and the narrative regularly veers very close to homage, with an endless supply of Chandlerisms like \u201cMean in a feral, fundamental way. Mean the way cats are stealthy and bees are industrious and vultures are indiscriminate diners.\u201d, \u201cShe finished her drink and brought the glass down like the gavel of a hanging judge\u201d and \u201cThere was a night behind her that was more than mere darkness.\u201dBut the attention to noir narrative doesn\u2019t make this any less a zombie thriller, and the style extends to the undead as \u201clike an army of macabre marionettes made of broom handles and sack cloth\u201d and \u201cstaggering and broken and with parts missing and debris acquired, like a taxi that\u2019s just driven madly through a dense jungle.\u201dThe plot and poetry are matched by the population of eccentrics including a one-armed barkeep, a philosophy professor preaching Nietzsche beneath the ruins of the Golden Gate Bridge, a alluring blonde pinup girl who can out-drink the toughest detective, a ruthless villain with a sadistic henchman, the world\u2019s luckiest pirate and a shell-shocked former zombie-squad officer with an overdeveloped sense of symmetry and paralyzing fear of the undead."}, {"userName": "Katie Thompson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68430610-katie-thompson", "userReview": "Extremely interesting.This was my first zombie tale. It was pretty fun. A combo of mystery and walking dead. With humor and gritty gore too."}, {"userName": "Philip James", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68401559-philip-james", "userReview": "I'm hiding this review of this book because I wrote them both.

A brilliant tale crossing both genres of zombies and detective thriller. Well written and a page turner."}], "description": "An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here.A street-weary former cop tracks a mysterious girl through the crowds and crises of a San Francisco Bay area twenty-five years into the zombie era. Deceased and Residing in Oakland is a mystery thriller in the tradition of American Crime Fiction, set twenty-five years after the beginning of the zombie apocalypse. San Francisco is a city under siege \u2014 it\u2019s heaving with refugees and it\u2019s seething with crime \u2014 but it\u2019s still a city. It\u2019s got cops and courts and commerce, and it\u2019s got one burned out cop in particular living a careful life a bay away from the rot that still stalks the suburbs, looking for a heartbeat. All he wants is a quiet life, but when he\u2019s hired to track down the mysterious daughter of one of the city\u2019s elite and the case starts killing his friends, he\u2019s forced on a high-velocity ride among the eccentric citizens and dangerous diversions of fortress San Francisco and all the way back to the last place he ever wants to be. The hard-boiled narrative is fast and funny and it reads like something you'd expect from Raymond Chandler, if he wrote zombie books: \u201cHis nose spread itself across his face like an inadequate police cordon trying to hold back an ugly mob.\u201d \u201c...a dress that flowed over her body like mist from a dry ice machine. It made me hope for a stiff wind.\u201d \u201cThe accompanying silence only meant that somewhere a saxophone was missing its cue.\u201d \u201cHe looked like a man trying to reach the handle of the knife in his back.\u201d \u201cAnd once again the gods of getting punched in the face had picked my name out of the hat.\u201d And so on like that, discovering and dispensing with a cast of eccentrics including drug-abusing pirates, one-armed barkeeps, mad professors with a Nietzschean perspective on the zombie apocalypse and suburbanites who are just trying to keep a decent wine cellar.", "title": "Deceased and Residing in Oakland", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34479554-deceased-and-residing-in-oakland", "average": 4.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1488790022l/34479554.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16933626.Philip_James", "name": "Philip  James"}], "type": ["Horror", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Suspense"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34479554-deceased-and-residing-in-oakland"]}
