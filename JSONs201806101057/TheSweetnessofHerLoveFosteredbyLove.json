As in her other works, the characters are well developed and the story well written. Not unlike many eBooks, more editorial errors slip through than the author would like, but these are not significant distractions. I note that Winnipeg, Manitoba is the setting for every one of the eight books by Kimberly Rae Jordan I have read. The supporting players in each tale are, for the most part, drawn from the same group of people with additions added as needed. The protagonists in each book are supporting players in other series and books. Although this story works as a stand-alone work, I recommend reading each series and the books therein in sequence for maximum enjoyment."}, {"userName": "Judith M.

Likeable characters and satisfying plot. After reading both books in this series, I find myself wanting more from this author. These stories are pleasant enough to read but just have the spark I'd like. I'll try another book in a different series before I give up."}, {"userName": "Cici", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/803000-cici", "userReview": "This is a sweet novella.

Loved the way Erin handled James's arrogance at the beginning of the story. Delightful romance."}], "description": "THE SWEETNESS OF HIS LOVE is book two of the Christian romance novella series, FOSTERED BY LOVE by Kimberly Rae Jordan. Noella, Erin, Tennyson and Forrest might have aged out of the foster system, but they didn't age out of each other's lives. Follow these four foster siblings as they move past their troubled beginnings to find love. \nPlease note: THE SWEETNESS OF HER LOVE is also part of the boxed set: FROSTING AND FLURRIES \nJames Dawson may have looked like the hero of one of the romances Erin Kirkland loves to read, but she quickly discovers that he is not the hero for her. After all, how can she have a happily-ever-after with a man who doesn\u2019t believe in love or marriage?  Who would have thought that a visit to his grandmother\u2019s favorite bakery to order a cake for her ninetieth birthday would end up causing James to re-evaluate his whole life? Certainly not James Dawson. But following their rather disastrous first meeting, James is determined to show Erin that he is a better man than she\u2019s first judged him to be.  Erin doesn\u2019t want to friend-zone James, but she\u2019s not sure she can trust that the changes he\u2019s making will be permanent. Can someone really go from totally dismissing love and marriage to embracing it so quickly? Stayed tuned for THE TENDERNESS OF HIS LOVE the third Christian romance novella in the FOSTERED BY LOVE series coming in Spring 2017.
