The story describes the artist that lives beneath, Behrman, as an old drunk who had never found success and hated weakness though he goes out in the middle of a storm to paint a leaf for Johnsy. This self-sacrifice is an interesting point why would he do such a thing earlier in the story he laughed at the idea of counting the leaves. The story does foreshadow him painting the leaf in that he is always talking about the masterpiece he is going to paint and how he is a protector of the two young women that live above him. Now the inference that can be taken from his actions is that he had touched no one with his art, he had no true masterpieces. By painting the last leaf he insured that Johnsy would be affected by his art, even only to get her through her illness. He paints a leaf in the pouring rain just for her and so she would pull through. She realized her foolishness when the leaf had staid and made a complete turnaround. The work done by Behrman saved her life."}, {"userName": "Mahsa  fanaei", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34073227-mahsa-fanaei", "userReview": "\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0647 \u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0634\u06a9\u0644 \u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u0634\u0646\u06cc\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u0686\u06cc \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0645 \u0628\u06af\u0645 \u062c\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u06a9\u0639 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f\u061f!\u0634\u0627\u0647\u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0641\u062f\u0627\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0634\u0628\u0644\u0647\u060c \u0622\u062f\u0645\u06cc\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u0648 \u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u062d\u062a\u06cc\u0627\u062c \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0647\u061b \u062d\u062a\u06cc \u06cc\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u0644\u06a9\u06cc \u0648 \u0645\u0635\u0646\u0648\u0639\u06cc"}, {"userName": "Khush", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76759105-khush", "userReview": "'The Last Leaf' is an excellent story. First, I read it in school. Now after years I read it again and found out what I missed in my first reading, and how my teachers were implicated in telling us only the 'safer' aspects of the story. They told us about friendship, concern, help and so forth, but they did not even slightly mention any other dimension, for instance, of same-sex love. I would have done the same if I were in their shoes.With adult hindsight, I see how this short story is about same-sex love. To state it more clearly, this story can fit into an anthology of modern-day LGBTQ writings. It is a story of two young women artists, Johnsy and Sue, who live together. One of them gets sick, and the other brings her back to health by her devotion and care. In the story, these two women are almost depicted like a homosexual couple. They live together and they deeply care for each other. In the story, we are told that they meet in a restaurant and learn that they have many things in common. They move in a shared flat. But I assume that there is more to this 'move' that O' Henry did not 'dare to speak its name' hundred years ago, he did not spell it out for us, however, he suggested its depth and its existence in very clear terms.At one point in the story, the doctor tells Sue that he cannot save those patients who lose will to live. He goes on to ask her Johnsy's condition has anything to do with a 'man.' This how they speak in the story;\u201cShe has a very small chance,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a chance, if she wants to live. If people don\u2019t want to live, I can\u2019t do much for them. Your little lady has decided that she is not going to get well. Is there something that is troubling her?\u201d\u201cShe always wanted to go to Italy and paint a picture of the Bay of Naples,\u201d said Sue.\u201cPaint! Not paint. Is there anything worth being troubled about? A man?\u201d\u201cA man?\u201d said Sue. \u201cIs a man worth\u2014No, doctor. There is not a man.\u201dThis is interesting how sharply Sue brushes aside this conjecture as if she is offended in some deep way. 'Is a man worth' also shows a very firm feminist streak in her, which only means that 'men' do not figure in their lives in the way doctor seems to have imagined. Later in the story, she helps and takes care of Johnsy in every possible manner. She acts like a seasoned lover. She chides Johnsy for imagining weird things about her sickness. For instance, Sue speaks to her with the poignancy of a sad lover. These words indicate their deep same-sex love. \u201cDear, dear Johnsy!\u201d said Sue. \u201cThink of me, if you won\u2019t think of yourself. What would I do?\u201dThere are also two other things in the story that make us see the connections between very visible contemporary gay life to the lives that were lived a century ago. It is interesting to see how Mr. Pneumonia enters the Greenwich village to infect its residents. Most of these residents are unusual in many ways, they are struggling artists, failed artists, people who want to do extraordinary things, and come from different parts of the country to inhabit this particular place, and be in the company of those who share their passion, their ways of being in the world. The story in these ways shows both the dangers and rewards that life poses to queer people without naming names."}, {"userName": "Niradhip", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17969689-niradhip", "userReview": "Wonderful story, demonstrates the power of hope and belief.
