Don't get me wrong - the writing in this book is astonishing. Moore has an ability to capture instants like no other author I've read. She's perceptive, incisive, unsentimental, and her ability to capture how we actually experience time - in sputters, jolts, and drawn out eternities - is jaw dropping. She firmly places the reader in time without showing off (I hate it when you can practically hear an author shouting \"look at the research I've done!!\"), just dropping tastes here and there. You find yourself immersed in 1978 Canada through jean jackets, station wagons, and my favourite, Red Rose Tea figurines.So why was I frustrated? One problem is that in Caught, Moore's chosen to tell a crime adventure story, exactly the kind of tale we might see ratcheted up on steroids and laughing gas in the hands of Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiaasen. But there's a disconnect between the way Moore writes and the story she's trying to tell. The same little snapshots of thought, observation, and memory that are a hallmark of Moore's writing get in the way of telling a good crime adventure. I was reminded of Zeno's dichotomy paradox (please don't think I'm trying to show off - this actually helped me figure out why I found the action unsatisfying). The paradox runs like this: in order to travel one mile, you first have to travel half a mile. But before you travel half a mile, you first have to travel a quarter of a mile, and so on to infinity. The idea is that there are infinite steps, so you'll never be able to travel the distance. In Caught, Moore continually breaks up the narrative into these little quanta of observation, and they pile up, one on top another, until you have a great description of everything that's happening, but no sense of ACTION.Also, I desperately wanted to get to know Slaney, the protagonist, but Moore keeps him at an emotional distance from the reader. Sure, I understand his motivations. He doesn't want to go back to prison, he wants to make this last big score, he loves and misses his old girlfriend. But I never feel what he feels. I want to root for the guy, but I don't know who he is. He comes from a huge family, he's a great sailor, he likes pot, but what makes him laugh? What makes him angry? What are his dreams, when all this is over? I waited and hoped, but Slaney never revealed himself.In the end, I don't think Caught works. The writing is good, piece by piece, but it doesn't hang together as a whole. I would have given it 2 stars, but there are so many wonderfully crafted bits that I had to bump it up to 3. Still, I was really looking forward to this, and I was disappointed."}, {"userName": "J. Robinson", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8797304-j-robinson", "userReview": "Don\u2019t wait to pick up a copy of Lisa Moore\u2019s new novel, Caught. It may strike you as a departure in terms of subject matter from her earlier work\u2014if not for its high literary quality it might inadvertently be slotted simply as a detective novel--but anyone who loves good writing will revel in the novel for many reasons. Each sentence in Caught is so carefully constructed\u2014each word has clearly been chosen with thought and meticulous care, and yet not so much as to negatively affect the pacing. Things I loved: the sharp, close observation, the attention to detail. The way the care so obvious in the writing underscores the naivet\u00e9 and relative looseness, almost carelessness of the central character, Slaney, and his gut level determination to trust that all will be well. The skillful use of irony that lets the reader but not Slaney in to the \u2018real reality\u2019 in the world outside his head. Slaney\u2019s shake-your-head type innocence in spite of his recent experience being incarcerated for four years before his escape. His trusting, having to trust, in a kind of fatal ingenuousness--believing he is not detected, doing what Hearn tells him to do even as readers learn that his childhood, high school, and crime buddy Hearn is not always reliable. The tremendous care Moore take with the language, the descriptions, the order in which information is revealed.The percentage of writers in Canada (or anywhere) who make it to star status is relatively small. True literary merit comes from the writing, book by book, the building blocks of a stellar reputation--the consistency, the superior control of the narrative. The high and consistent skill level in each book, shown again, and yet again. Fine writing, engaging prose, beauty of the literary turn of phrase. (\u201cThe darkness seemed to charge across the prairie toward them, deepening as it came.\u201d Or, \u201cThe leaves of the lupins chussled like the turning pages of a glossy magazine.\u201d) (The ability to handle suspense, plot, character. (\u201cHe\u2019d broken out of prison and he was going back to Columbia. He\u2019d learned from that first trip down there, the trip that landed him in jail, that the most serious mistakes are the easiest to make. They are mistakes that stand in the centre of an empty field and cy out for love.\u201d) Moore does it all. Moore draws her characters quickly, effectively, memorably. Description never weighs down the prose: there is always just enough, sharply, accurately observed. Consider this: \u201cHearn\u2019s freckles and a red bandana he had knotted around his throat. He was skinnier and more muscled and he\u2019d let his fiery hair spring out in an afro. He looked high and a little haunted.\u201dOr: \u201cThere was a couple making out farther down the platform. The girl had on a long crushed-velvet coat with fake fur trim and a red tube top and denim miniskirt. The coat was slipping off her shoulder and she was wearing white go-go boots and her leg was hooked over the guy\u2019s hip and his hand was disappearing under the hem of her little skirt.\u201dThe word \u2018mastery\u2019 comes to mind\u2026the ability to move in a new direction without faltering, without misstep \u2014Moore engages and keeps her reader close, with her, word by word, comma by comma.If one of the things that distinguishes literature from non-literature is that it is at least as much about how it happens as what happens in terms of action, then there is no question of Caught\u2019s place. One could read Caught simply for the narrative line, but an even richer reading is a close one, one that looks at that how.Another is the level of meaning available to readers whose tattered copy of Francine Prose\u2019s Reading Like A Writer is close by. Read for a plethora of rich themes involving family, roots, love, community. I am reminded of Northrop Frye\u2019s seeing story in literature as a move either from integration to isolation, or isolation to integration, and the toll taken on a character as s/he moves from one to the other.In Moore\u2019s prose here and in her other books there is concision, clarity, care. Not to mention a great capacity for compassion, and humour."}, {"userName": "Hanne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9653496-hanne", "userReview": "I know Lisa Moore best as a short fiction author. I think that is a style that suits her perfectly, and one that she cannot completely shake off in this novel. The precision with which she writes, all the hidden metaphors and images throughout the story, they all look like they come out of short story. Only I\u2019m not sure that it really works in a full scale novel. You just read novels a different way, or at least I do.Sometimes there is paragraph that really catches your attention though, like this one about a hen while our protagonists are sitting in a crowded bar in Latin-America about to order some chicken for dinner: \nOut on the cobblestones, a hen was testing the pool of light under the street lamp, touching it once and then again with its claw, jerking the inert lump of its blazingly white body forward by the neck, taking teensy steps. The hen froze in the centre of the light, full of trembling.\nThe book opens with David Slaney escaping from prison, where he found himself due to a drug smuggling charge. His goal is to get back to his old friend and drug-smuggling buddy who avoided his stay in prison, take a boat to sea and start smuggling drugs again.Slaney is pretty much like that hen testing the pool of light in front of him. He picks at something he thinks is important to try and snatch for himself, but he might end up being food for someone else\u2019s gain. Also, his new-found freedom is in the spotlight of the police men who are searching for him, and it\u2019s hard to taste freedom when you\u2019re not sure it'll last. The relativity of \u2018freedom\u2019 is what\u2019s being explored in this novel. Are we free, or are we only left to think that we are, like the bees in the quote below? Did we escape the net, are we stuck in it, or are we just not aware of how big the net is?\nThe bees escaped, he said. Last summer. They get it in their heads.You got them back? Slaney said.I just had to wait for them to settle down somewhere, he said. Then I snuck up on them with a net.\nI\u2019ve tried to put this book into a genre but that\u2019s a pretty difficult thing to do. I saw some book blurbs about this being an adventure story, which I don\u2019t think it is, because they tend to be much more fast-paced, nor does it have the twists and turns you\u2019d expect. The cover art doesn\u2019t really work either, i don't know why it was chosen, it just doesn\u2019t seem to fit with the book at all. Yes, there is a moment when a woman in a red bikini comes out of the sea, and the sea plays a very important role in the book both as the sea itself and as a symbol of freedom. But the atmosphere created with the art just doesn\u2019t fit with the book in my humble opinion. It\u2019s missing something simple to change the tone of it, to add some mystery, perhaps something like this?The other thing that disturbed me was the lack of dialogue punctuation. Despite it being a direct dialogue there is no punctuation and no structure with everyone getting a line to themselves either, so it sometimes hard to keep track of who is saying what. Example: \nThe things you see in retrospect, she said. He\u2019s bald, for Christ\u2019s sake. You don\u2019t understand it, you couldn\u2019t. You think I haven\u2019t been in love? Slaney said.\n I\u2019ve tried to figure out why Lisa Moore would have done this, but I can\u2019t find a reason except to slow down the pace of the reading overall, which would be an odd reason anyway. \nThere were, at first, only two splats, the size of quarters, on the giant windshield and they trembled like things with a consciousness, things trying to hold together against a terrible force of entropy, and then they ran sideways and a drumming began on the roof and the world.\nPerhaps none of it matters; perhaps dialogue punctuation deserves some freedom to not be where they are supposed to be too, just like Slaney does.

Come on, really. There's practically a grow op on every block in Vancouver. This would make as much sense as Alberta buying its beef from Florida. Also, marijuana would be awkward to smuggle. Its stinks and its not worth a lot of money per pound. I don't understand why they weren't smuggling cocaine instead. Because of this I found it hard to believe Slaney's character. The fact that he would embark on such a stupid endeavour contradicted the author's attempt to make him appear intuitive and emotionally intelligent."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "A classic cat-and-mouse story in which a Canadian drug smuggler escapes from prison to score another load of marijuana from Colombia. Moore paints Slaney and Hearn as \u201cmodern-day folk heroes,\u201d and her writing elevates what could have been a plain crime story into real literature. From the title onwards, the book is heavy with foreshadowing as Moore exploits the dramatic irony that readers know the police have a sting operation trailing Slaney the whole way.

First, someone quoted an old professor who had said something like, \"There are too many great books in the world, more than you can read in a lifetime, to waste your time reading merely good books.\" I armed myself with this philosophy as a mental justification for not accepting the kinds of books that people like to recommend to me: My mother-in-law is a fan of historical romances and is forever saying things like, \"This book started out okay but got a little better and I thought that you might like to read it Krista\"; or my brother suggests thrillers or sci-fi (\"Don't you ever just read a book for its plot, Krista?\"), but with my quest for the great books, I have been able to politely point out that I have my own book pile to get through and no thanks to yours. Then I read another quote that challenged my notion of the great book: \"Anyone who states 'I don't read genre fiction' is masking intellectual insecurity.\" That floored me, and being a person of moderate intellectual insecurity, I had to wonder, \"Is it true? Do I focus my reading on literature because I don't want to be seen reading pulp? Or is it not a public unmasking that I'm afraid of, but rather a revelation of the lie I'm telling myself; am I not as smart as I think I am?\" This reminds me of the movie A Fish Called Wanda, wherein Kevin Kline's Otto character was constantly reading and attempting to quote from Nietzsche (a name he can't even pronounce) and Jamie Lee Curtis, as Wanda, called him stupid anyway:\nWanda: But you think you're an intellectual, don't you, ape?Otto: [superior smile] Apes don't read philosophy.Wanda: Yes they do, Otto, they just don't understand it!\nIt should have been easy to just dismiss this \"intellectual insecurity\" business, but since it resonated with me, I needed to reconcile the notions of \"great books\" and \"genre fiction\" and concede that they are not necessarily mutually exclusive, even if I have zero interest in Romances and Westerns and Sci-Fi and Crime\u2026 And then Lisa Moore, quickly climbing to the top of my list of favourite authors, releases Caught; a book that, right from the garish, pulpy cover, announces itself, unabashedly, as genre fiction: Crime; Adventure; Detection. With her mastery of mood and place and character, Moore elevates the clich\u00e9 to the sublime, to the literary, and proves that a great book can be found within any framework.We meet Slaney on the run, having just escaped from prison, and with Moore's customary layering of past and present, we quickly learn what crime he was convicted of (drug smuggling) and where he is heading (more drug smuggling). It's a wonder why someone would break out of prison just to commit another crime, but we soon realise that Slaney's youthful optimism, his hubris in the face of obvious obstacles, is his strength and his undoing.\nThis time they would do it right. He could feel luck like an animal presence, feral and watchful. He would have to coax it into the open. Grab it by the throat.(H)e knew how to look at people so they could be who they were, which basically meant he had a capacity for trust. He thought of trust\u2026as a vestigial organ, near his liver, swollen, threatening to burst. Maybe it would poison him. But it was also his special skill. His strength. \nThe fact that Slaney trusts the people around him (despite discovering Hearn's many lies, despite his reservations about Carter and Ada, despite getting a bad feeling about Brophy) makes his eventual capture a foregone conclusion (also reinforced by the title Caught in bold red font on the cover). But as Patterson muses about the foregone conclusion of a bullfight:\nIt was the certainty that satisfied some desire in the audience. The best stories, he thought, we've known the end from the beginning.\nWhich begs the question: If we know how this story will end, what's the point of reading it? To which I would answer: It's about the journey. Within the framework of the Crime genre, Moore writes with her astonishing craftsmanship. The irony of the authorities knowing Slaney's every move, from having allowed the prison break to using ghost cars to pick him up while hitchhiking to move him along to his next criminal venture, was jarring and delicious; I found myself sympathising with and rooting for each side in this cat and mouse game; both Slaney and Patterson deserved to come out on top.There is a chapter in Caught (Truth and Knowledge, pp 131-136) that perfectly illustrates what I think of as Lisa Moore's unique style. It relates two stories about Slaney as a twelve year old, two events that happened on the same afternoon: a baseball game that reveals his character and formative relationships with Hearn and Jennifer; and finding his parents with an encyclopedia salesman at home, which captures their hopes and expectations for him (and adds further irony since the reader knows Slaney becomes a convict). Although there is a definite sequence of events, ballgame then meeting the salesman, the stories are interspersed, a page about one, a couple paragraphs about the other, weaving back and forth, until the revelations seem larger than the sum of the two events. It's this type of alchemy in Moore's writing that make the journey more than worthwhile-- I could reread this chapter over and over again and not see how she accomplishes the magic of it.Lisa Moore seems to address my own misgivings about genre fiction through the indiscriminate tastes of the youthful Ada:\nAda was reading murder mysteries and Hemingway and she had a Fitzgerald and a really good Dashiell Hammett, she said, and when she was done she tossed them over the side\u2026She'd read three Agatha Christies in two days\u2026Ada closed the book and sat up straight, looking hard at the horizon as if she'd just figured something out.The big reveal, she said. That's my favourite part.Why are you reading those stupid things? Carter asked. \nThe question I find intriguing is: Was Carter referring to just the Agatha Christies or to Ada's entire book pile as \"those stupid things\"? Is Lisa Moore purposefully conflating the classics with the genre fiction? With literary allusions throughout the book (Slaney could be thought of as a modern day Odysseus -- on his odyssey there are sirens, sea monsters [giant squid], a Cyclops [spy satellite] and a hurricane [sent from Poseidon because of his hubris ?]) and Hearn becoming a professor of literature, the author is acknowledging the literary while seeming to write an adventure tale. As in all great fiction, there is more to this book than meets the eye.Although I did enjoy this journey very much, I didn't feel a perfect connection with the characters and plotline, and so I can't give Caught a perfect grade. I am delighted, however, to have been educated on how genre fiction can indeed contain great books."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl", "userReview": "\"Chussled\". It's a lovely word.As in, , \"The leaves of the lupins chussled like the turning pages of a glossy magazine.\" Descriptions are precise, unexpectedly shining light on small details, illuminating the reality. The reality is mundane and unforgiving, but Moore portrays her characters with sympathetic understanding.Slaney is a man helplessly caught in his own stupidity. He got caught trying to smuggle marijuana into Newfoundland. Very little in the book actually took place in Newfoundland, but fog and boats still got squeezed in there. He gets out of jail in 4 years, and promptly embarks on renewed plans to smuggle in an even bigger haul of weed. Slaney never really seems to get that he is his own architect of folly. He was caught once, and swore they -- the system -- wouldn't break him. \"He would not betray the innermost thing. He didn\u2019t know exactly what the innermost thing was, except it hadn\u2019t been touched in the four years of incarceration. Come and get me. They couldn\u2019t get him. It fluttered in and out of view, the innermost thing, consequential and delicate.\" He is determined not to get caught again, but simultaneously believes getting caught again is inevitable.

But I never felt like I got to know or understand the characters. And the dialogue was super distracting. People talked in a kind of shorthand that was hard to follow. Plus, the author didn't feel the need to use quotation marks, which drives me crazy! So, you're not always sure who's talking or if someone is even speaking aloud. Why do writers do that? It doesn't advance or add to the story.

I mean that in the best way! How she contrives to make us care about both the detective and his prey is very masterful. Throughout this very exciting story, I was rooting for Slaney to get away and also for Patterson to catch him so that he could get his promotion. This is probably what made the novel so much fun to read. This book is very different from \"February\" although, once again, the sea plays a very important role, almost taking on the status of a character. However, \"Caught\" is much more of a linear narrative with a clear plot line. Still, Lisa Moore again requires effort from the reader. I like having to work when I read a book. If it is all served up neatly on a silver platter, it is not as interesting or entertaining for me.

He sets out to try to recoup his losses by marijuana traffficking from Columbia back to Canada. The book is all about how David Slaney sees the world as he treks across the country and down the Pacific Ocean to Columbia. He's trying to keep one step ahead of the law the whole time, but inevitably he finds that the law is just there around the corner from where he is. David Slaney is a truly appealing character. He's a bad guy, but he's a likeable bad guy. The action is set in 1978, so no modern technology available for the cops who are on David's tail. It is certainly a unique look at the crime novel genre, and I think that's why Ms. Moore made the shortlist in the 2013 Giller Prize race.

He had to believe trust was pure too. It was worth fighting for. He trusted Hearn. He could say that out loud. It would be better that way. And he had no choice. Trust lit up on its own sometimes without cause, and there was no way to extinguish that kind of trust.\u201dLisa Moore has an unusual writing style. There is an untutored quality to her writing that feels unique and unpracticed. It makes this reader slow down, and read more thoughtfully. There is no formula. The things Moore chooses to highlight in her writing somehow lead readers down the rabbit hole of associations and one is drawn into her fiction almost against our will. In this novel, the young man Slaney escapes from his jail sentence for importing narcotics into Newfoundland and seeks out his former partner for another swing at the pi\u00f1ata. If writers write about what they know, the reader can\u2019t help but wonder which side of this story Lisa Moore knows most about\u2014the drug running or the law enforcement side. She makes it into a spine-tingling story, with a young man evading the law following him at every turn. We have a slightly queasy feeling in the beginning, knowing our man means to try his hand at drugs again, despite having lost four years of his twenty-five to the inside. We know early on, too, that the police know his whereabouts and are allowing him to think himself free. Then there is the title, about which, even halfway through, we are still not sure. We want to suspend belief. We come to admire our man Slaney.

Straight off the bat, the story begins with adventure and suspense as David Slaney escapes from prison and is making his way towards the highway to be picked up by a friend of his sister\u2019s. Despite having been locked up for 5 years on charges of marijuana possession, Slaney is dedicated to returning to the drug business and tracking down his partner in crime Hearn. \tThe novel ended up being one of my favourites read in class, though I was initially not too interested. It is full of twists and turns along the way as Slaney tries to evade the police and find his way to Colombia under many disguises. The story is very easy to understand, written in a way that is directly to the point which kept me interested throughout the whole novel. The story is full of intrigue as well, making readers question what would happen next. Another aspect I liked a lot about the book was how credible the events in it were, it could almost pass as a novel based off a true story. The description of emotions and feelings in the novel were incredible as readers could imagine themselves in the position of David Slaney; his worries, excitement, joy, doubts and disappointment. Another great aspect in the novel is the aspect of freedom and whether or not it could ever be fully attained. Slaney feels free the moment he escapes the prison and this feeling only intensifies when he is on the open waters with Roger and Ada. Only when he is captured later does he realize he was never free. He had felt free for so long, so how does this feeling change when he learns he was simply being tracked? Does the feeling even change? What are the limitations of freedom; can complete freedom ever be completely attained? The answer is yes and no, while we are free to act as we would like, there are limitations set by laws and social regulations; it can be argued that the notion of freedom within itself is flawed.\tThe novel was intriguing and captivating, and probably the best book I have read in class this year. The story was easy understand and the themes were easy to pick up on. The plot is clever and keeps the reader interested throughout. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is interested in mystery or adventure type novels."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11260990-rachel", "userReview": "\"There are mistakes that stand in the centre of an empty field and cry out for love.

There was always that fear of will he get caught. Though it did give me some stress while reading I really liked it. I had not read a novel previous to caught where it actually affected me physically as well as emotionally. I attribute that to really good writing. I think relating to a criminal and seeing Slaney\u2019s human side was really a very eye opening experience for me. Though I like to have an open mind I know when I started the novel knowing that Slaney was escaping prison I thought, I don\u2019t care if he gets caught. However as a progressed I saw he was a nice guy who really didn\u2019t do much harm in the first place. He seemed like He was just trying to make a life for himself. I thought that yes he was trying to take the easy way out but it was clear that that seemed the only way for him. I actually really grew to like the character to my surprise. There were also really nice moments where he took in the beauty of the world. Those still peaceful moments really drew me in to the story. I think that the moments were really wonderful but what made them so powerful was Slaney\u2019s situation. He was so appreciative of these moments having been locked up for so long and the reader could tell how important they were for him, which really portrayed to the reader the real meaning of the story. For me the message I took was to make each good moment last and to not take them for granted. I really enjoyed the novel and would highly recommended"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27479235-laura", "userReview": "Caught was a fast paced novel that kept me on edge and turning pages into the night. The character of Slaney was relatable and interesting despite being a criminal. Slaney may have been a drug dealer but his character was charming, resourceful and very human. I don\u2019t usually read books that are as fast paced as Caught but I was pleasantly surprised by how enthralled I was in it. I think a strength of the novel was the beginning because having it open on a prison break gets the reader immediately interested in what will happen next. Unlike, other books that drag on for a while before they get interesting this book put the reader directly in the action from the very start. One weak point of the novel that I would like to point out was the lack of developed women characters. The women in this novel seemed to be purely there to help Slaney or move the plot forward. I would like to have seen more developed women characters but I understand that the plots main focus was Slaney and adding to many other developed characters may have thrown the plot off. In my perspective the main themes of the novel were freedom and money. I thought these themes were communicated really well in the novel and I liked the fact that the themes suggested morals that people should live by. I always enjoy when there are deep messages about life behind novels. Overall, I really enjoyed the book even though it was not the first book that I normally would pick up to read."}, {"userName": "Felicity Gibson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21292589-felicity-gibson", "userReview": "\u201cCaught\u2019 by Lisa Moore. ( Read January 3rd 2014 ) Lisa Moore\u2019s \u2018Caught\u2019 is a real page turner. The story is easy to understand: there is a smuggler (escaped from prison), a cop following him, a chase and a supporting cast of rogues and secondary characters. The book starts strong with a hair-raising prison escape in Nova Scotia. David Slaney, partially succeeds because the police want to track him to his partner in crime, who we get to know is Hearn. He crosses Canada to find Hearn and to try and recoup his losses by drug trafficking. The book is all about how David sees the world as he treks across Canada and then down the Pacific Ocean to Columbia. He is always just one step ahead of the law and in reality the law is just one step behind him. David is an appealing character; he is a bad guy but he is also very likeable. This book is set in 1978, so there is no modern technology available to the police in their chase. This is certainly a unique type of crime novel. The story is always upbeat and the characters portrayed with sympathetic understanding. Descriptions are precise, shining light on small details and illuminating the reality. I think this book would make an excellent movie.  I enjoyed this book so much \u2013 it held me completely and I could not put it down. I give it 4 stars.Thank you to Netgalley and Grove Press for allowing me to review this book."}, {"userName": "John Rikhtegar", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31238510-john-rikhtegar", "userReview": "I am a high school student, and this was by far the most enjoyable and fun book for me to read all year. The novel, 'Caught' by Lisa Moore, depicts the adventure of David Slainey, a Newfoundlander convict who has escaped the Nova Scotia prison and has set across Canada to start up once again, his drug dealing addiction. This is a very mysterious novel, and can be easily related to us, Canadians. David Slainey wants to reach Vancouver, and Lisa Moore talks about numerous Canadian provinces which we, as the reader, can picture more clearly than if it were to be set in Eastern Africa or Europe. Caught really intrigued me because of its mysterious yet adventure tendencies, which keeps us, the reader, right beside David Slainey throughout the entire novel. The way Lisa Moore wrights her novels, allows for the perfect amount of suspense and surprise, while finding out character secrets every step of the adventure. I believe to me, that this is Lisa Moore's best novel she has written to date and that Caught is a novel about trust and the grand risks we take all because of the lives that we want and the person whom we desire to be. I would recommend this novel for anyone in high school, not middle school, because it deals strongly with drugs and rough word choice.

I thought that the action in the novel made it interesting, but I found that the book was difficult to read because of how slow the events took place. I thought that the characters were unique and very interesting; and the relationship that they shared were very sweet. I found that it was strange that the author chose not to use subtitles which bothered me at first, because I did not know what was going on. I did not enjoy how the novel was rather predictable. As I read the novel, I was hoping that the protagonist would end up getting away, but as suspected he ended up being caught, which I found a little dumb. I really enjoyed the relationship that Jennifer and Slaney shared, I think that his love of romance really brought out a very interesting side to his character. I did not find this novel captivating, and I would not necessarily recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading for leisure.

This book was really, really good. Well-crafted writing that surprises with its creativity and sometimes reads like prose. Moore's written a friendship between the main character Slaney and his partner in crime (literally), Hearn, that reminds me of the relationship between Ren and Amanda in \"Year of the Flood.\"Also, interestingly, I had a conversation with my boyfriend recently where he said that he hadn't read a book by a female author in longer than he could remember. This wasn't on purpose, but when the whole Gilmour thing happened, he started thinking about the fact that of the 40-odd books he's read this year, none were by a woman.

But evading the cops isn\u2019t his only objective; Slaney intends to track down his old partner, Hearn, and get back into the drug business.
