I was not expecting that ending, which is obviously a good thing in a murder mystery story, but I am proud of myself for picking up on some other clues. I am so impressed by how she was able to weave this intricate of a story in only 200 pages and I can't wait to pick up another one of her novels in the future!"}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james", "userReview": "5 stars to Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. I chose to read this Christie spectacular after finishing \"And There Were None.\" She's such a treasure - never disappoints.A train. A murder. Multiple suspects. Nearly an alibi for everyone. But wait, there's a motive for everyone. How did this seemingly impossible murder occur? Hercule Poirot knows.Well, I'm glad he did because I was stumped! But with good reason as this plot twist will have your knickers locked down (and not just in a bunch!).The plot is just too delicious. The characters are just fascinating. No modern day electronics. No ability to research anything other than by asking questions. And Christie wrote this nearly 100 years ago. That's why it's a 5 for me -- it's pure good storytelling without anything in the way."}, {"userName": "Mohammed Arabey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2016", "userURL":

astounded by how much fun this was. I mean, this may be just me, but \u201cearly-to-mid-twentieth century mystery about train crime\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly scream nonstop thrill ride. But here we are!I\u2019m also not sure why it took me so long to write this review (two months, to be exact, so actually not that long for me but still) but again, here we are.I don\u2019t actually really want to say much on this book, which is astounding in its own right because my number one hobby is making up various excuses for me to wax romantic on various subjects and generally listen to myself.But! In this case, that would be bad. Because a lot of the rad-ness of this book is due to the twist, but the Last Thing I Ever Want To Do is spoil this twist for you. Maybe this book will not sound fun because of my saintly consideration of your twist enjoyment, but you should just tuck away in your head that it\u2019s completely cool ok???Let\u2019s discuss the very limited number of things I won\u2019t feel bad about disclosing.For one thing, the way this is constructed is very fun?? It takes you through the thought process of Hercule Poirot (Extremely Cool Belgian Detective - capitalized due to its being his official, government-ordained title) as he analyzes the sitch. So it kind of feels like you\u2019re a detective too, and if that\u2019s not the dream I don\u2019t know what is.If you can look me in the eyes (but please don\u2019t, I\u2019d like to keep these relationships strictly internet-based thanks) and tell me you wouldn\u2019t drop everything immediately in order to become a detective and/or international spy full time, you are not someone I\u2019m interested in knowing thanks.Agatha Christie\u2019s writing style is also really sharp and clean (which I can detect but nevereverever apply to myself, apparently). That\u2019s probably why her books aged so well. This one definitely did, at least.I think some people were rubbed the wrong way (horrific expression my apologies) by the constant discussion of race/nationality as an inherent and generalized part of people\u2019s individual psychology. That would\u2019ve upset me, probably, if it weren\u2019t applied to e v e r y b o d y. Like, if white people got the easy way out, one, what else would be new, and two, that would be the worst ever. Instead, every point of origin mentioned (Africa, England, America, France) is given its own psychoanalytic significance. Which is honestly interesting to read about, if only from a historical standpoint.Are you guys proud of me for how well I remembered this book after two months??? I am visibly prouder of myself for remembering three things about a novel I genuinely enjoyed than most scientists are after major breakthroughs.Which is incredibly on-brand for me.Bottom line: Quick fun historical well-written!

And I think it was exactly that moment when I finally realised that I was right, because as soon as I thought it, I instantly latched onto the conductors testimony and from there on everything fell into place. ;-) I knew he must have lied and therefore been involved in the crime and then I thought about all those little hints I collected so carefully. The weapon in the spongebag, the mention of the actress, the door that was open, the incriminating pipe cleaner, the familiarity between Colonel Arbuthnot and Mary Debenham, the number of wounds on the victim and especially the remarkable difference of those mentioned stab wounds, \u2026 the list could go on and on! *lol* Once I made the connection with the Princess, it wasn\u2019t all too hard to figure who the Countess was and after analysing every character that was on the train I came to the same conclusion as Poirot! ;-) Sure, there were some clues and hints I didn\u2019t get, but in the end it seems like I was able to find the most important ones.

Why is this considered one of Christie\u2019s finest creations? Many say that, arguably, it is her best work and this view I do share.I don\u2019t think any of us need a synopsis. To say the story is well-known would be an understatement.

So what is it that makes this novel by the Lady of Crime so iconic and a point of reference?Is is the exceptional cast of characters, each one battling with the demons of the past? Is it the wintry atmosphere? The intense feeling of claustrophobia, of being trapped in a train, within a snowstorm, in a foreign country with a dead body lying in a compartment? Or is it the absolute, ultimate questioning of the moral values we have come to adopt? What is right and wrong? When injustice isn\u2019t punished, to what extent can we bend the human limits?

The premise is very straightforward; master detective Hercule Poirot happens to be aboard the Orient Express rail car when one of the passengers is killed in the night. He is then set to the task of solving the crime while the train is excavated from a surprise snow drift. Because this is such a short mystery novel, I believe it's best to go in with as little outside knowledge as possible. In fact, there's only one thing I really want to focus on in this review and that is this. I did not guess the murderer. That is probably the biggest compliment a reviewer can pay to a mystery novel. I didn't even know what the hell was going on for most of this novel if I'm being perfectly honest. Now, call me an idiot if you feel so inclined, but I personally thought the mystery was very well written. Especially given that we discover clues in time with Hercule Poirot & are limited to knowing only what he knows.

I\u2019ve never read an Agatha Christie novel. Why is this a big deal, you might be asking yourself if you have also never jumped on the Christie train. (Train? Get it? Because this entire book takes place on a train! *laughs forever at own joke*) Well, I\u2019m a life-long bookworm, with a degree in English literature to prove it. And Agatha Christie is the unarguable queen of an entire genre. Did you know that Agatha Christie is the best selling novelist of all time, second only to the Bible and the works of Shakespeare in terms of sales? Because I sure didn\u2019t. I knew that she was a big deal in the mystery genre, but bestselling novelist of all time? I was unaware. But I know now, and have now taken my first step to rectifying my oversight.So the question is: what did I think of my first Christie novel? I loved it! This was the tenth installment of the Hercule Poirot series, but thankfully it was a perfect place to start. From what I\u2019ve gathered, each Poirot novel stands perfectly well on its own, and that was definitely the case with Murder on the Orient Express. This little novel was published in 1934, and it has aged incredibly well. Even though the book was published 83 years ago, the language was incredibly simple and easy to sink into, and the plot was super engaging. I loved that all of the suspects were confined to the train with Poirot and the victim, and that Poirot had no outside assistance to aid his crime solving. Also, that ending was a complete surprise to me. I usually manage to guess plot twists and endings, especially in murder mysteries. I didn\u2019t guess this ending, and it was refreshing.The characters were wonderfully varied. Some of them tended to almost be caricatures, but always for a reason. The star of the book, Poirot, actually took a back seat to the other characters, but this was very purposeful. Poirot is a more laid-back and introverted person than many famous detectives, which works incredibly well for his line of work. When people don\u2019t notice you, it\u2019s easy to observe things they\u2019d prefer remained hidden. Sherlock Holmes has always been my favorite detective. I\u2019ve read every single novel and short story Conan Doyle crafted about the famous man with the mind palace, and I am completely addicted to the BBC show starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Seriously, I\u2019ve watched each episode at least half a dozen times. Not that there are many episodes to watch\u2026 *sobs in a corner* That being said, I already love Hercule Poirot. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019ll ever quite equal Sherlock, but I fully intend to give him every opportunity. I will be reading more Christie novels, and soon.For more of my reviews, as well as my own fiction and thoughts on life, check out my blog, Celestial Musings."}, {"userName": "Alejandro", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/665584-alejandro", "userReview": "All aboard to the mystery!\n\nWILL THE REAL POIROT PLEASE STAND UP?\nMy visual memory of the famous fictional detective Hercule Poirot is the actor Sir Peter Ustinov, yes, I know, he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s described on books (and even according Agatha Christie\u2019s daughter, he doesn\u2019t behave on screen like the book detective) but when I was a kid, I\u2019ve never read any Agatha Christie\u2019s novels, meanwhile I have watched several of the theatrical films and TV movies made by Peter Ustinov and along with watching him in several Biblical movies, well, that image stuck in me.Curiously enough, I remember watched the 1974\u2019s adaptation to film of Murder on the Orient Express but I didn\u2019t remember that Ustinov wasn\u2019t in that particular adaptation but Albert Finney. As I told you, the image of Ustinov stuck quite deep in my memories.I haven\u2019t watched the recent work by David Suchet, that thinking about the actor, he looks indeed like it should be look like the fictional Hercule Poirot.However, now in the incoming (November 2017) new adaptation where Kenneth Branagh will perform the famous detective, and while certainly he doesn\u2019t look like Ustinov, Finney or Suchet, I trust in the great acting skills and carisma of Branagh to deliver an amusing new version of the Poirot.\nTRAPPED WITH A MURDER!\nNot always, but it\u2019s cleat that Agatha Christie enjoyed to find amusing ways to keep trapped her characters in a scenario where they were unable to leave the place and well knowing that a murderer is between them and even sharing space with the corpse.You can find similar trap-like situations in other books like Death on the Nile (having Poirot investigating that case too) and the famous And There Were None, for example.Here, in Murder on the Orient Express, the cast of characters are trapped in a train (The Orient Express, duh!) due a snowfall, in the middle of nowhere, so they can\u2019t get out, and a murder is committed.Due the crime is in 1934, they haven\u2019t ways on the train to communicate with anyone asking for help (for the crime or the snowfall), and the responsibility to find a culprit for the murder is up to the famous Hercule Poirot, that coincidentally get aboard, in the last minute, on the equally famous Orient Express.This is challenge to Poirot in the mental field, having to trust in the testimonies of strangers but......also he should do a balance between law and justice\u2026\u2026since not all crimes need to be really solved\u2026\u2026while other crimes deserved sharp justice.\nLYING MYSELF\nWhen I watched the trailer of the incoming new adaptation (November 2017) of Murder on the Orient Express, I knew that it was about time to read the original novel finally, and before of the premiere of the new film.I\u2019d watched the 1974\u2019s adaptation when I was a kid, sometime that a local TV station did a cycle of Agatha Christie\u2019s mystery movies (theatrical and made-for-TV alike) and while I hadn\u2019t remember many details,\u2026\u2026well, the solution is so epic (don\u2019t worry I won\u2019t spoil it!) that it stuck in my head as deep as the image of Ustinov (not matter that he wasn\u2019t in that particular adaptation!).So, for reading this novel, I had to lie myself and keeping engaged at the speed of the developments in the book, without thinking how it was solved, and you know what?...\u2026it worked!Since I enjoyed a lot the reading of the book, not matter that I had clear how it\u2019d end (again, I won\u2019t spoil it!

It sounds simple and you should be able to solve it but I didn't DAMN IT! With Orient a man is murdered on a train, all 12 people on the train car are suspects, the train is snowed in and the police cannot reach it. Unfortunately for the murderer, the world famous detective Hercule Poirot is on board. This sounds so simple but I didn't guess the murderer.

The writer shows you everything: the clues are all before your eyes: you rack your brains, trying to fit a solution on the jigsaw, but are unable to do so: then, in the last chapter, the author reveals that one bit of detail which you overlooked, but which was actually crucial to the solution. You kick yourself for being such an idiot, then bask in the afterglow of having been fooled by a master.A conventional whodunit has certain rules. First, there is a murder. There are a fixed number of people who could have done the murder, who are equal in terms of motive and opportunity. As the story progresses through its twists and turns, the reader keeps on guessing, shifting his suspicion from one suspect to another. If the novel is well-written, the author will succeed in totally removing suspicion from the actual murderer before the final revelation.Very rarely does an author break the basic rules and get away with it smoothly, as Agatha Christie does in this novel. It shows what a master of the craft she is.The Murder on the Orient Express is a classic locked room mystery: in the snowed-in train, one of the twelve passengers have to be guilty. And as the past history of Ratchett (the victim) as the mastermind behind the kidnapping and murder of little Daisy Armstrong comes to light, we know that we are in for a real humdinger: because there are so many people wishing him out of the way, and many of them are likely to be on the Calais coach. But when Poirot unearths the fact that each and every one of the passengers is connected to the Armstrong family in some way, we feel that Dame Agatha has stretched coincidence to the limit, even if it is in the interest of a good detective yarn.But then all is revealed: There is no coincidence. They are all there as part of a plan, and they are all guilty! In fact, Poirot is the coincidence, the joker in the pack.I have not read another mystery where all the likely suspects are guilty! This is such a grand flouting of convention that would have fallen flat on its face, had not the story been carefully structured to make it possible. The American household is possibly the only one in the world where you can find all nationalities. If such had not been the case, the connection of the occupants of the coach to the Armstrong family would have been evident much before Christie wanted to reveal it. And the snowed-in train is the only possible setting where all the suspects could be cloistered without the possibility of outside interference, as the plotters thought the train would move on, and that the murder would be attributed to a person or persons unknown. It all fits in the end.Also, this one story where the ending is just perfect.(On rereading the story, I noticed certain incidents and snippets of dialogue (especially the one between Colonel Arbuthnot and Mary Debenham) which seemed to point in one direction but on hindsight, were crystal-clear in their meaning. This is why I love rereading Christie's books... it gives valuable insights into the author's technique.)

Thanks to help from a friend, he gets the last berth on the Orient Express, which was full of passengers. On the second night of the trip, a man is murdered, and tensions rise when the train gets stuck in a snowdrift. Poirot realizes the murderer must still be on the train, and sets out to interview everyone and figure out who is lying. This is a clever story, and I can see why it's one of Christie's most beloved mysteries.Dan Stevens' performance was so marvelous that after finishing I looked up what other books he has narrated and was thrilled to see he also did a reading of And Then There Were None. Highly recommended!Favorite Quotes\"The impossible could not have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.\" \"If you confront anyone who has lied with the truth, he will usually admit it - often out of sheer surprise. It is only necessary to guess right to produce your effect.\"\"I like to see an angry Englishman,\" said Poirot. \"They are very amusing. The more emotional they feel the less command they have of language.\""}, {"userName": "Henry Avila", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5431458-henry-avila", "userReview": "The lone train chugs down the tract westward, in the cold, dark, winter's night, over a country that no longer exists, from Istanbul,Turkey, to Calais, France, then across the English Channel by boat, for home, a long, tedious, three day trip. For Hercule Poirot, just having successfully wrapped up a case, in Syria, yet he's summoned again to another. No vacation, for the tired man, London calls and he goes...The little Belgian detective (please stop calling him French), is much in demand. Becoming rich and famous, solving difficult mysteries, all over the European continent, and beyond is hard work. The Great Depression, doesn't effect him....Quite strange but the train's coachs are full at this time of year too, poor concerned Poirot, can't get a first class compartment, luckily Monsieur Bouc, a director of the train company, and friend of Hercule's, is on board, helps the detective. Second class accommodations, he receives ( apparently not that close of a friend to M. Bouc). Poirot shares a compartment with a young, likable, American Hector MacQueen, working for an evil looking fellow American, a millionaire by the name of Samuel Ratchett. The man asks Mr.Poirot, to work for him he needs a very good bodyguard desperately. Someone has threatened his life, but the detective refuses, doesn't like his face, which greatly angers the aloof millionaire, preparing to compensate Hercule, very well indeed. Past midnight the train is stopped, by a snowdrift in the middle of nowhere, what was then, Yugoslavia. It might be days, before they can be rescued worst still , a murder has been committed during the stormy night. A cry was heard, maybe a groan by Poirot...in his bunk. Ratchett, no big surprise , was butchered with numerous stabs to his body, Dr. Constantine, examines the corpse, seems puzzled by the bloody wounds...they don't make any sense. An all encompassing shadow falls on the train... No weapon is found... of course M.Bouc, hires Hercule to find the killer or killers. The bored Belgian, is revitalized, gladly accepts the assignment and challenge, a dozen passengers, French, Russian, English, Swedes and Americans, a dozen suspects...From royalty , the middle class, to servants. Later , the stained knife, in a bag is located, als0 a handkerchief, button, burnt letter and other items are inside the dead man's compartment. Too many clues, to be credible, all starts to clear when the victim's real identity , is found out. He was a gangster, Cassetti involved in a notorious kidnapping, back in America, obviously patterned after the Lindbergh case of the early 1930's. The problem for Hercule is, everyone of the passengers has a good alibi, Mr. or Monsieur Poirot, has a lot of time to think, nothing adds up... too many coincidences...Who knows when or if the people of the Orient Express can be saved....But from whom ? For fans of mystery stories one of the best, Agatha Christie at her prime..."}, {"userName": "Melisa - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42481357-melisa---traveling-sister", "userReview": "Finally, I\u2019ve read this book!

Now, whenever I saw this book on here or in a bookshop I pictured a very diverse and interesting cast of characters and a classic murder mystery. So far so good. I also imagined sun and heat and maybe something typically oriental but my own stupidity stopped me from realizing that in Winter, you know, it's cold. Even on the Orient Express. Especially in the mountains. Well done, Kai.Apart from that I got what I wanted: a fascinating murder case, lots of suspects and an equal amount of liars, traditional detective work and a spectacular ending. The only thing this novel lacked of was suspense. And that's one thing a crime novel should have for sure. Not even the big murderer revelation was all that thrilling anymore. And Then There Were None was much better when it came to thrill and excitement.In a nutshell: I liked the book but I can't wait to love the film.Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin", "userReview": "You know what I love about this book, Goodreads? You wanna know what makes this book just a downright pleasure to read? It\u2019s just a good old-fashioned murder mystery with no frills, no multiple timelines, not big plot twists, no no no no. It\u2019s not that at all. It\u2019s just a short little mystery with an overwhelming cast of characters to keep track of, and, gee whiz, are these guys eccentric. And they all could be a suspect. So here\u2019s how the book breaks down:There is a murder on the Orient Express. I\u2019m sorry if that spoiled the book for you. Poirot and his awesome mustache interview the passengers on the train. Poirot, awesomely mustached, considered everyone\u2019s testimony and examines all of the evidence. Poirot, alone with aforementioned mustache, creates some theories of what could have happened. Poirot and his mustache address the others with what happened at the end of the book. That\u2019s it. And the end is absolutely worth it. I really enjoyed kicking back and just settling into this one. I never found myself thing to solve the mystery on my own. I just let the story unfold without drawing my own conclusions. I loved the simplistic format of crime, interviews, evidence, solve the crime, books over. Have a nice day. It\u2019s a really concise mystery that doesn\u2019t waste time with fluff and description, except Poirot\u2019s mustache. It\u2019s driven by dialogue as the investigation plays out, not by unnecessary side plots or backstory or whatever. This was my third Agatha Christie novel, and I\u2019ve loved al of them so far. I\u2019m only ready the popular ones though, and i guess I have like 63 to go or something. I\u2019m not holding my breath. She\u2019s a great writer though and can really weave a story together with a satisfying ending. And now I get to watch the newish movie that came out last year. More on that later, maybe.

I read this back in high school and decided to pick it up when I saw \"read a book you read in high school\" on my public library's reading challenge this year. I have enjoyed Poirot pretty much since I was old enough to read on my own. Christie goes deep into her characters and just when you think you solved the case, she has Poirot reveal a completely different outcome. This book was just as fast reading as the majority of mysteries I read today. The differences are 1. Her language is much more colorful than the average contemporary author, 2. She develops every character in depth even if they will only appear in one book, and 3. It is not obvious to the average reader whodunit soon into the book. Due to the nature of the book it became fast reading and enjoyable.

But HOW??*Murder on the Orient Express is one of Agatha Christie's most revered books for a reason. She uses the trope of the locked room mystery as a foundation and then further heightens the \"impossible\" crime by situating that locked room on a moving train. If that's not enough reinventing of the old mystery wheel for one day, her solution is also a bit of a game-changer, but I'll not say too much about that here!I will, however, offer some suggestions for readers looking for locked room mysteries that are a bit off the beaten path. During the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, locked room stories were very popular, and those of you who are interested in classic examples of the genre should have no trouble finding print anthologies or online archives to explore. But i'm drawn to the \"yes, and...\" approach to writing, with conventions given a little twist, genres blended, those unexpected tweaks that make a book memorable.
