Its structure is a bit forced (nine innings, or periods, of baseball history). The 9th inning, as others have noted, covers a large time frame compared with earlier \"innings.\" I'm not sure that the decade is the best way of organizing baseball history, either. Still and all, that's more a matter of taste than anything else. The book's authors candidly observe that they will focus on eastern teams, e.g., Boston Red Sox and Brooklyn Dodgers, \"because we felt their stories especially rich in the human drama that accompanies the history of every team.\" However, I agree with a reviewer (who bears the name of one of Detroit's best first basemen ever) who laments that this really does slight the deep baseball history that covers much more territory than New York to Boston. Again, though, certainly not a fatal flaw by any stretch in this book. This book is seen as complementary to the documentary series on PBS, designed to elaborate certain issues in ways not possible in the TV medium. Some of the special features in both the documentary and book are the recollections of Buck O'Neil; interviews with historians, writers, managers, and players. Finally, essays by a number of \"guests\" represent an interesting twist. Roger Angell has a wonderful Introduction, \"Hard Lines,\" in which he juxtaposes the apparent ease of playing baseball with the harsh realities of players often fighting just to stay in the big leagues or losing the joy for the game (note the brief discussion on Carl Yastrzemski). He observes that: \"Once we understand how really hard it is, we become citizens of baseball, admiring its laws and just paths, even when the luck of the day hasn't gone our way.\" Other guest commentators include George Will, Bill James, and Doris Kearns Goodwin. But the book is about baseball, so the nine innings are themselves the heart of this book. The early years, up until 1900, feature a strange game to us today, with very different rules--as well as the origins of racial segregation in the game (the issue of race is one of the main themes of the book). The second inning discusses the game as \"Something like a war,\" when players played and fought hard. And so on. No need to provide a full chronology. Some special segments: the role of Babe Ruth, in the Fourth Inning, helping baseball dig out from under the disaster of the Chicago Black Sox, who threw a World Series. The Sixth Inning features the end of segregation in baseball, with Jackie Robinson's big league debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers. A final quotation from Buck O'Neil illustrates how the game can be addictive--to players (and even to fans), when he says: \"There is nothing in life like getting your body to do all the things it has to do on the baseball field.\" All in all, an ambitious work, trying to capture the spirit of baseball, its sins, and its contributions. While I do have some questions about this volume, as already noted, it ends up not quite being a home run, but it surely is extra bases."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28103300-linda", "userReview": "Enjoyed"}, {"userName": "Pupils", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71993826-pupils", "userReview": "The book baseball by Geoffrey c. ward,ken burns is a great book.It gives a lot of background info on how the game was created.It also talks about the legends like babe Ruth,Willie mays,etcIt is worth the read.It has so many facts and data about the legends.It tells you about how the game was created and the equipment was designed from.That is why I think that baseball is a good read.

Surprised the most of the book was about what seemed to happen off the field rather than on it. Learned a lot that I hadn't known before. The 10th Inning addition was disappointing--felt as if it focused solely on steroid scandal and how it has been a game-changer. I suppose if I had lived through the other events described in this book, I may feel the same way about the rest of it. Great overall, especially for baseball fans who haven't seen the Ken Burns documentary."}, {"userName": "Catherine Woodman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912889-catherine-woodman", "userReview": "I am definitely not a huge baseball fan, but one thing that is very true of Ken Burns is that he is so passionate about the things that he documents, and brings so much enthusiasm to the subject that unless you are dead set against what ever it is, you will be sucked in and enjoy what he enjoys--it's a gift he has. The photos in this book are spectacular and unlike alot of coffee table books the writing is actually better than the pictures.

And, furthermore, I absolutely still don't. But after reading this, I do care enough to say that its intricate history deserved a bit better than this sloppy kiss of a love letter.If you already love baseball, you'll probably love this. If you don't, then I doubt that Ward is going to woo any new converts. The book flat-out assumes you're already on board with sitting through 9 innings of a baseball game. Welp, it does a good job of simulating that, because I'm bored in a regular baseball game and I was pretty bored out of my mind for most of this, too.While I haven't seen the documentary that this book covers, I reckon the info fits a miniseries format a lot better. In book form, it does not reward a straight read-through. Ward tries to tell the history of baseball, but constantly interrupts himself with new tangents. It's especially obnoxious when multi-page interludes literally jump in the middle of a sentence! And then there's the unnecessary essays. Consequently, what you end up with is a weird. hulking, organized mess.However, there are pockets of smart, thoughtful writing, as well as amazing anecdotes. And every once in a while, there was the beautiful synergy between the glossy photos and the pages where I could feel the games come alive, and watch Babe Ruth in live action call out his famous homer.And really, I can't be too mad at this book, because let's be frank about its real purpose: to sit on your coffee table and get people talking about the All-American sport. Because boy howdy is it hard for people to ignore the huge big blue sunnavabitch! Even the IT guy at work shared with me about how he plays for a softball team as he fiddled with my PC while I was reading. And, you know, I didn't really mind."}, {"userName": "Theo Logos", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9793933-theo-logos", "userReview": "A fun, fine overview of baseball's history that by necessity of what it is leaves more out than it puts in. You will enjoy this book more if you are a fan of Boston, Chicago, or any team that originally played in New York, as these teams get far and away the bulk of the love. Game greats like Honus Wagner and Ty Cobb get but passing mention while the above mentioned teams get thorough coverage in every era. Despite this unevenness of coverage, I still might have given this enjoyable book five stars but for two most dubious choices. Kirk Gibson's dramatic World Series home run, which came in the first of that series games, is given in depth treatment, while Bill Mazeroski's unprecedented walk off home run in the 9th inning of the seventh game of the '60 World Series goes unmentioned. And when discussing the advent of Latin players into the game, the author chooses to focus on Felipe Alou (played for the Giants, originally a New York team) rather than the great Roberto Clemente, whose name is mentioned just once in passing with no detail. As a Pirates fan, and as a baseball fan, those oversights merit docking a star."}, {"userName": "Jordan Douglas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71996843-jordan-douglas", "userReview": "This book is a very interesting book if you like baseball. It talks about the history of baseball and how blacks and white had two different leagues. This book also talks about how baseball was like a war between the whites and the blacks. The author talks about three people in the book, Joe Dimaggio, Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson. It talks about Jackie Robinson because he is the first black player to come to the white person league. He stopped the racial divide in baseball even if he constantly had white people trying to hurt him. After Jackie came into the game blacks started thinking higher of themselves and thinking they were the same as the whites. I would recommend reading this book if you like the history of baseball. The book also talks about the American dream major league baseball. It says that everyone dreams about playing in the majors. This book explains all of its settings and topics very well through the book."}, {"userName": "Tyven", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64835908-tyven", "userReview": "This book is basically a tutorial on how to play baseball!!!!!!!!

Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Joe DiMaggio . . . truly gifted human beings acting out universal fantasies that, for whatever reason, are most perfectly expressed on a baseball field.All this and more rings through Ward and Burns's moving, crowded, fascinating history of the game - a history that goes beyond stolen bases, triple plays, and home runs to demonstrate how baseball has been influenced by, and has in turn influenced our national life: politics, race, labor, big business, advertising, and social custom. The audio covers every milestone of the game: from the rules drawn up in 1845 by Alexander Cartwright to the founding of the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players in 1885, from the 1924 Negro World Series through Jack Roosevelt Robinson's major-league debut in 1947, and Nolan Ryan's seventh and last no-hitter in 1991.Monumental, affecting, informative, and entertaining - Baseball is an audio that speaks to all Americans.", "title": "Baseball", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1663455.Baseball", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1186539131l/1663455.jpg", "reviews": 53, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44048.Geoffrey_C_Ward", "name": "Geoffrey C.
