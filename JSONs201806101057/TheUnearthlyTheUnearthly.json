No, that\u2019s just the Unearthly\u2026and Gabrielle Fiori. I don\u2019t often read in the YA paranormal romance genre, mostly because I\u2019m so sick of shallow, insecure, simpering female leads. Gabrielle Fiori was anything but. She\u2019s confident and goes after what she wants, and she\u2019s just dripping with attitude. While reading The Unearthly, I felt like shouting out, \u201cFinally!\u201d For once, an author gets it.**SPOILER ALERT***Gabrielle Fiori is the last of the sirens, which means she\u2019s both beautiful and cursed with bad luck. It definitely seems that way when she starts her first week at Peel Academy, a boarding school she only realizes later is for supernatural legacies (she didn\u2019t get the memo because she\u2019s an orphan)\u2014which include seers, shapeshifters, werewolves, fairies, nymphs\u2026etc. All the new students\u2019 supernatural abilities are revealed at the awakening, a ceremony which initiates them into the supernatural community. Gabrielle is revealed to be not only a siren, but also a vampire. And then she dies.She wakes up later in the morgue, and her body is changing. At this point the school is ready to expel her, since vampires are considered the most evil on the spetrum from good to evil. Andre DeLeon, the king of vampires, is called in to be her mentor, and that\u2019s when things really start heating up.The tension between Andre and Gabrielle is just perfect. He\u2019s pushy and used to getting what he wants, and well, so is she. Basically they both totally want each other but are too stubborn to give in. He\u2019s supposed to train her, but she\u2019s growing into herself as a siren\u2014and as calm and cold blooded a vampire as he is, even the king of the vampires might not be immune to Gabrielle\u2019s siren side when she turns up the heat. ***END OF SPOILER ALERT***The story takes place on The British Isles, and the world is complex and well put together. You get the sense there\u2019s a lot more going on behind the scenes. I also love how everything\u2019s juts a little different than what you\u2019d expect from a typical YA. I think Laura Thalassa writes for a slightly more mature audience, which I like. I also love the pace. Things just move at an awesome clip from the beginning. I\u2019m not one for pages and pages of back story or interior monologue, and this book skips all of that and goes right to the good stuff. A warning though: the book does leave some important stuff hanging, which the author assures us will be resolved in the next book. So in a sense, it does end on a cliffhanger. So be prepared once you finish this book to scour the internet looking for the sequel.You won\u2019t find it. It doesn\u2019t come out until 2014:("}, {"userName": "\u2728 Kaira \u2728", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41536721-kaira", "userReview": "I seriously read this in the span of 2 hours since it's really short. if you ask me, this is the moooooooost cliche and cringiest book I've ever read. the heroine being not into fashion, being super unique, being super duper gorgeous to the point her old school hated her for it are enough to get my eyes rolling. the male hero, however, is the perfect definition wattpad character. he's a freaking vampire, king of vampires. he's gorgeous. he's rich. bad boy. in short, he's a douche and a cliche. the plot was awful, to be honest.

I am glad to have discovered this series, it had a great start. Also, the other books seem to be better. *fingers crossed**Review to come!*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I picked this book up in a whim because I was bored with what I was reading at the moment and wanted something light, intriguing and with fantastical elements. And The Unearthly is just that. Laura Thalassa did an amazing job in creating this series. But first, I'll you give a little summary.For all her life Gabrielle Fiori wanted to fit in. She has troublesome past of which she doesn't remember a lot. She doesn't even know who her real parents are, the only certainty is that they are dead. The only constant during the years seems to be \"the man in the suit\". But who is he and what kind of plans has the future for Gabrielle? She doesn't even know how her life will change forever. Gabrielle is going to change school. She didn't feel good in her previous one, but the one she is going to attend sounds perfect for her. But what is Peel Academy in reality? Good question. And I bet you are not expecting this. Peel Academy is an elite supernatural boarding school on the British Isles. Boom, I told you. Anyway, Gabrielle discovers to be the last of the sirens, daughter of Celeste. Her only desire now is to fit in. During the ceremony during which all the future students awaken (that means they discover what kind of supernaturals they are), Gabrielle dies right after drinking the magical elixir. When Gabrielle wakes up in the morgue twelve hours later, something wicked is awakened in her, something even the supernatural community has never seen before. Now the only person who can help her is Andre de Leon, the community\u2019s infamous bad boy and the king of vampires. Yet even his help can\u2019t prevent the repeated attempts on Gabrielle\u2019s life. Someone is after her, and they will stop at nothing to end her short existence. Only Gabrielle cannot let that happen now that her soul hangs in the balance, because she may have met the devil. And he wants her. Bad.\n\u201cBe careful of whom you trust. Sometimes knowledge from the dead has a way of cursing the living.\u201d\nI have read quite a few books of this genre and I have to say The Unearthly really surprised me. It is a mix of Harry Potter, Twilight and serial killers and in a very good way.The world Laura Thalassa created is poignant, clever and highly addicting. And I say it because I read all 5 books in 3 days. Yes, that much addicting. I appreciated all the little details and their explanations. Sometimes an author forgets to explain why and what something is and you are left wondering and you may arrive at the right conclusion, but you may also not. The magic involved wasn't too prevalent, but exactly the right amount. I was pleased by the great variety of supernaturals. For once, there weren't just wizards, vampires or dragons. There were fairies, shapeshifters, seers, witches, werewolves and other kinds of human transformations, sirens, demons, fallen angels and more. All in one (or 5) books. I was also pleased by the main characters' personalities. I didn't like all of them, but I enjoyed their characterization anyway. Gabrielle was a bit annoying I must say. She felt like a victim most of the time and I wanted her to a badass heroine kicking some ass. She wasn't. For the 2/3 books. Then things change and I was a happy girl. Anyway, back to book #1. Gabrielle was okay, needed a braver personalities and the power to recognize good things and bad things, which she doesn't have at all. My favorite characters were her two best friends: a gay fairy and an empathetic seer. Oliver was the funniest, crazier, foul mouthed gay teenagers I have ever read about. His personality was phenomenal and I laughed every time he was on scene. Some may found his inappropriate statements a bit too much, but I loved them, they were always spot on and fun. But I kinda love inappropriate jokes (shameless confession), so I dig that. Leanne on the other hand was the best friend anyone would want. She is funny, sympathetic, she's always there to listen, protect and guess the future for you. Not bad, right? And then there's our dear Andre de Leon, king of vampires and a celebrity among humans. He was such an interesting character. Sometimes you got the feeling he was hiding something or didn't tell the truth, but it didn't disappoint me or annoy me at all. Andre was strong just as much as his personality was. He was cruel and loving, he was a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide kind of character. Arrogant jerk and lovable man. Rough exterior and soft soul. And I liked that. He was also hot and that didn't hurt either.Gabrielle\u2019s life is in grave danger from one page to the next. Action upon action creates a nice heart racing experience while reading this book. The question throughout has you jumping from one suspect to the next. The pages almost turn on themselves. You want to read more and more and you can't stop it. Yes, sometimes you may find it stereotypical or too common, but I have to say it depends on the mood.The end creeps up on you, leaving you a bit breathless. So many factors bring a good deal of WTH while reading and in the end, you lose it. You want more. Luckily for you there is book #2 already waiting for you.Will Gabrielle and Andre fall for each other? Will the supernatural world accept Gabrielle? Will she manage to survive? Who is the man in the suit and what does he want from her?Go read it now and then you'll tell me if it isn't addicting or what."}, {"userName": "Al *the serial series skipper*", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4167077-al-the-serial-series-skipper", "userReview": "Laura Thalassa ( is it weird that I say Tallahassee in my head) sure loves her sirens and that's fine because I love her sirens.

I started and finished reading it in ten hours. Would have been less if I didn\u2019t need to eat, drink\u2026breathe!When I started reading it, I thought to myself: This sounds very much like Harry Potter. Orphan, check. Magical school, check. Two funny sidekicks, check. Main character clueless about own power, check. Only difference would be it\u2019s about a teenage girl rather than a little boy. Then as I read on, all comparisons disappeared and I was taken into a completely different world. Both magical, both captivating but oh so different.Gabrielle is an ass-kicking, fighting machine who can hypnotize you with her glamour and convince you to let her drink you dry. And everyone wants her dead.My only issue with it was Gabrielle\u2019s level of maturity. Maybe I\u2019ve never been around a lot of sixteen year old girls but she seemed far too mature in the book. Able to hold her own against a 700year old vampire and the likes. However, it didn\u2019t deter the pleasure of reading the story. (really want this one!) Yes, this book is just another teenage paranormal where the main character turns out being the most powerful person on the planet\u2026just another story with vampires, fairies, werewolves, shape-shifters, etc\u2026just another doomed romance\u2026BUT OMG!

I won\u2019t lie I am a bit of a cover whore, so the first thing that drew me to this book was the beautiful front cover. People who say that books shouldn\u2019t be judged by their covers need to make good covers, 99% of the time people will pick up the book if it looks appealing and they will only read it if it has a good blurb. This book had both, along with lots of 5 star reviews. I can tell the author tried to put a whole new spin on the boarding school theme, it\u2019s been done a lot in Young Adult; Harry Potter, Vampire Academy, House of Night, Afterlife to name a few but if done well it can be successful. We got a generic description of the school other than it being a castle, no information about any of the staff other than two teachers is given. Timetables, classes, students, uniform, for goodness sake even where they ate their dinner would have been nice to have been mentioned. But no, the author made the mistake of spending far too much time focusing on the hero. I have no problem with that, but the lack of world building seriously irked me. If an author chooses to set her/his story in a boarding school, the conduct and day to day affairs of the place are vital for the readers to grasp a better idea of what is going on. The story immediately lost a few stars for these reasons alone.Books are meant to take a reader on a journey; they should suck you in from the beginning. Granted it\u2019s too much asking every book set at boarding school to be like Harry Potter but the aforementioned books aren\u2019t exactly the best of literature but they are successful in building a realistic world. Although I have many problems with this book, it was a decent read. I liked the setting of the book at Isle of Man, although more description would have been better. What made me want to throw this book at the wall was how the news of the supernatural world was broken to Gabriella, I mean seriously? Her reactions were laughable. Possibly the cheesiest moment of all would be:\u201cI am the king of vampires\u201dI mean seriously?I just had to stop a moment couldn\u2019t they be any other way for that piece of information to come out? I think the author was going for dramatic impact but it ended up sounding real silly. I liked Gabriella\u2019s new friends at the beginning, but they too seemed inconsistent. Oliver began to irk me, I think the author was going for the blunt gay friend but it just came off as rude I wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with Oliver. And Leanne was likeable but did not appear much in the book; I felt her friends should have taken a stronger interest in what happens to her especially after the amount of times she was nearly killed. At times I felt like screaming at the character\u2019s, 16 is an immature age. I don\u2019t understand why every single YA author deems it so necessary for their characters to be this age. It makes me want to scream really loud. Gabrielle\u2019s deductive skills were awful; if Andre wanted to kill you I am pretty sure he would have already. This book was already in need of being edited better, they were many grammatical errors that I noticed. Overall, I think if I read this book a few years ago when I loved just about anything that I got my hands on (yes I am talking about twilight and yes I am ashamed) I would have liked it. But I\u2019ve grown and I feel this book is another YA book that all slowly begin to resemble one another because they are no differences between them anymore."}, {"userName": "Jaime (Two Chicks on Books)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3722438-jaime-two-chicks-on-books", "userReview": "I think this is Laura's strong spot.

So this book gets 3 stars from entertainment alone.Characters. I did not like almost all of them. Gabrielle was really annoying and something about her just bugged me. I feel like she tried to seem superior to people and her attitude was annoying. This was the same way I felt about Angel in another one of Laura's books. But at least Gabrielle has more of an excuse as she's a teenager. Andre was interesting, but such a classic 'macho' guy. I wish we saw a softer side of him.

It actually wasn't too bad in this, but alas, it was there.The writing... it just was not great. There wasn't anything bad about it, but... I don't know. I find that, except with The Bargainer series, I don't like the way Laura write her characters and their conversations. They seem so fake, immature, and just annoying.The plot. It could have been really interesting, but as it felt contrived it fell short. However I am a sucker for vampires (pun intended) and supernatural schools as mentioned before, so it kept me invested. That being said, everything was pretty obvious. The 'killer' going after he, not shocking who it was. All the supposed twists, were not very twisty.Also this just drives me insane. WHY DOES THE GIRL ON THE COVER NOT LOOK LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER?!? Did the people who made this book cover read it first? Apparently not.I'd recommend this if you're looking for a short book, that isn't the best, but it's classic drama and supernatural high school."}, {"userName": "Georgia-Rae", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42240139-georgia-rae", "userReview": "\u201cBe careful of whom you trust. Sometimes knowledge from the dead has a way of cursing the living.\u201d \nThe Unearthly is the first book in The Unearthly series by Laura Thalassa.Born a siren, Gabrielle Fiori has more supernatural blood running through her veins than she realises.After arriving at Peel Academy, an elite supernatural boarding school in the British Isle, Gabrielle is given an elixir meant to fully awaken her supernatural abilities.Twelve hours later she wakes up in a morgue and now she must seek help from the community's infamous bad boy and king of vampires, Andre de Leon.Unfortunately someone is after Gabrielle and multiple attempts are made on her life. With the devil looming and trying to reel Gabrielle in she will have to tread carefully.\n\u201cSeriously Gabrielle? Look who you\u2019re talking to\u2014I\u2019m a gay fairy. I\u2019m the world\u2019s biggest clich\u00e9.\u201d \nOkay so while Andre could be a pompous pain in the butt sometimes the tension between him and Gabrielle was pretty great. Andre really doesn't act like someone extremely old but that seems to be a common occurrence in books with 'old' vampires in young bodies. Why three stars I hear you ask? Well Andre was kind of a jerk majority of the time and Gabrielle constantly put herself in dangerous situations despite knowing better... but it's still worth a read in my opinion.Thanks for reading!

I just see so much potential if this could move up in rating from a PG-13 to just below R! It's got so much going for it, so many qualities that it probably would have been a series I added to my favorites list. I'm still continuing series, while its missing heat for me, I still enjoy reading because it's a very fast easy read."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18599360-katie", "userReview": "Yawn* not the typical story I loved to read by this author.

I need a life.I liked this. It was a quick read with action and romance. The pace in the beginning was too fast. The relationships between the characters were built out of thin air. One minute she was at home in the next she was at the academy. She was a normal girl one second and in the next she was a vampire/siren/soulmate. I didn't like that.Onto the next one."}], "description": "The first time I was declared dead, I lost my past. The second time, I lost my humanity.
