This main character is one of the most judgemental characters I have ever read. She says the worst things about people who are overweight, just plain mean. And in doing so, she also says every white girl is just a rich mean snob. I couldn't find anything redeeming about her and for one I didn't care. Points for being a POC living in 1984 New York City, but honestly I just pretty much couldn't stand her cynicism and point of view, even if she pretty much dislikes her mom. The fact that she is also Catholic? Well I don't even want to go there.. I gave a shot but I honestly don't recommend this."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4844580-jessica", "userReview": "Looking at this cover and title, I thought I was in for a bubbly book about a girl getting revenge on the pretty girls in school. Ha, boy was I wrong. I guess I should really start reading the back covers of books I get for review before reading them...It's 1984 and 14-year-old Faye has found herself in with the wrong crowd. With a mother who hates her and a dad off doing his own thing and not really in the picture, Faye really has no idea where she fits in, so she starts hanging out with girls who think it's fun to steal. But one time they go too far and Faye thinks she may have killed a harmless old lady when they were trying to take her money. So Faye goes back to check on the old lady and finds way more than she bargains for. Faye begins to spend more and more time with the old lady, though she can't really figure out why. Either way, Faye starts to learn more about herself that she had never realized before. Now this may not have been at all what I was expecting, but I did end up enjoying Faye's story once I got into it. Faye has such a rough home life, so it's no surprise she starts hanging out with the wrong people. I felt so bad for her for how her mother treated her and I just wanted to her to tell someone about it or stand up to her mom. But Faye's only 14, so I guess I understand why she was so passive with her mom. My favorite part about this book had to be Evelyn Downer, the old woman Faye starts to hang out with. She's so witty and strong-willed that I would love to have a friend like her, no matter how old she was. Throw in the fact that she was a huge movie star back in the day and I am a goner. Evelyn has her own secrets, though, and I think that's what makes her the perfect person to be in Faye's life right now. This definitely did not turn out to be the bubbly, snarky YA book the cover makes it look like. No, this one turned out to be a story about a troubled teen just trying to find her place in the world. I love how an old lady ending up being the one to save her. Also, I really love books that take place in the past (Eleanor & Park was in the 80s as well and I LOVED that one), so it was fun reading about when there were no cell phones or internet. This one was definitely a unique read and I have to say I enjoyed it a lot. Some parts lagged a little, but overall I really felt for Faye and enjoyed reading her story of finding out who she really wants to be."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3350535-melinda", "userReview": "I wish that I had known what I was getting into before I started reading this book. Usually I can find a redeeming quality in a book but this one was hard for me. From the hateful descriptions of Caroline's fatness to the constant inability of Faye to own her issues, I just was over this book. So here's the kinda good. The book flowed from moment to moment. I wasn't ever confused about what was going on even if I didn't understand why. I felt sorry for Faye's home situation. Her mom needed help of the therapy variety and she didn't really get it. I like that the Old Lady (Evelyn?) gives Faye perspective on her life that helps her get on a better life path. That was the positive, so here's some negative. Everyone who had any fatness on them is described in tired old tropes of fatness as slow, conniving, devious, gorging and close to death. Here's an amazing idea: Fat people exist and they are healthy and living good lives like everyone else. At the end of the day, characters like Caroline are evil because of their personalities not their fatness and as an author (even one who has created a fat hater character like Faye) it is not necessary to use body size to create a not so relate-able or lovable character. Faye isn't any better than Caroline except Caroline is constructed as unlovable and darling Faye is supposed to be viewed as skinny, misunderstood and abused. I very rarely dislike books but for me this book pushed my buttons and I don't see myself reading more of her work."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1581374-suzanne", "userReview": "The title is sort of deceptive: There\u2019s not really very much revenge in this book, so I\u2019m a bit afraid that teens who pick it up will be expecting some hi-jinks at the expense of mean girls, but that\u2019s not what they will get, so there\u2019s one reason they might not check it out or read it if they do take it home. Another reason some might not dig it is the mid-1980s setting. Just long enough ago that some readers might miss some of the fashion and popular references, though Faye\u2019s obsession with Michael Jackson\u2014she professes complete willingness to be his bride\u2014will not pose much of a cultural divide. I\u2019m starting with some negative things here, but there are some nice positives as well to recommend the book to people who might know what they\u2019re getting. It\u2019s not an exciting book, not much action or romance. Instead, except for a few episodes, it\u2019s rather quiet and unexceptional. I do like that Faye and most of the characters in the novel are Black, but their being Black isn\u2019t an issue. It\u2019s just a young adult book about a Brooklyn girl during her freshman year at a Catholic school with a crappy mother, absentee father, and pretty low self-esteem who meets a flash-in-the-pan movie star from the Hollywood glamour days of the 30s under the worst of circumstances, and it ends up changing both their lives. I don\u2019t see it as hugely popular, but it might be a nice fit for teens facing some insecurity and belonging issues.Faye doesn\u2019t really know where she fits in, not so much at the Catholic school where even the uniform doesn\u2019t fit her as well as it fits the curvy kind of popular girl who attracts the guy she has a crush on. She does have one good friend there, but there\u2019s no one in her neighborhood except fat Caroline and her cousin Gillian. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers, so these two girls like to mug pretty girls and take their money and even rough them up a little. I guess that\u2019s where the revenge part comes in if only briefly. They take their theft to a new low the day they set upon old Evelyn Downer as she carries groceries into her apartment where the girls had been lying in wait and hoping for a big score based on rumors that the old lady was a movie star. They are disappointed in their takings, and Faye actually pushes the lady down, leading to guilt that brings her back on her own a couple of days later, where she discovers Evelyn still down on the floor and needing help.Faye\u2019s mother treats her like a criminal and a nuisance and is free with physical beatings, so when her mom starts farming her off to a neighbor lady who watches kids so that Faye can\u2019t get into trouble alone in the house, Faye uses Mrs. Downer as a way to do something else, even if it\u2019s just tea and toast or a walk to the park. The two become friends and even confidants, ultimately giving Faye just a little more confidence and backbone when it comes to conflicts with her mother, who finally agrees to divorce her dad and starts dating a Jheri-Curl dude who turns out to be quite nice; in decisions about which friends she should spend her time with; and even in trying to reach out to bring Evelyn back in touch with an estranged daughter. On the way to getting just a little bit stronger, she has a few missteps, very relatable one for girls: an impromptu make-out session with her crush who doesn\u2019t even acknowledge her at school the next day and a shoplifting incident among them. Ultimately, this is a decent gentle rites of passage novel."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123069-shelley", "userReview": "This is definitely a fat-hating book. Based on the title, I really expected it to challenge societal ideals of beauty, but it doesn't. Prettiness isn't actually discussed all that much, just that pretty = mean and that other people will like pretty girls no matter how mean they are. But Faye, the narrator, is just as shallow as anyone else. She has a crush on Curly because he's so good-looking, even though he doesn't care about Faye and they don't even really know each other. She comments on her disgust about every fat person she encounters, and the author has a variety of ways to insult fat people: a runner in a silver jogging suit looks like a container of Jiffy Pop, Caroline has giant man hands and her having a boyfriend is like \"Jabba the Hut winning a beauty contest,\" and Faye wonders how a fat person could be allowed to be a nurse, since she's obviously at risk of diabetes and hypertension. You never even find out what it is about Faye that makes her not pretty. She can't afford cool clothes? She got that haircut? She's so short? The author seems to use \"pretty\" as a synonym for rich or entitled or popular. I also thought it was interesting (strange) that the author decided to set the story in 1984. I didn't really see what it added, except maybe that the author was a teenager then, and felt more comfortable telling a story set in the 80s?"}, {"userName": "Natalie Couch", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5439824-natalie-couch", "userReview": "I didn't much enjoy this book when I first picked it up, but Faye really turned it around by the end of the novel. For every recycled plot line in the book, there is also an equally unique message unfolding. Faye is the real embodiment of youth crime and broken, destructive homes. She never comes off as a stereotype, and her growth as a character is touching. I'm a bit confused, though, about whether or not she fully redeems herself for valuing beauty too much. She sees Gerald differently in the end, but only after he praises her looks. The end seems hopeful though; she just still needs time to grow."}, {"userName": "Alma  Ramos-McDermott", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3352918-alma-ramos-mcdermott", "userReview": "Fourteen-year-old Faye lives with her abusive mother in a rundown section of Brooklyn in 1984.

More heartfelt than I thought it would be! Faye is how most girls are when you go through so much in life, that you kinda don't know or care where it might take you.

Her life is pretty much full of unfortunate events and one of them that takes the cake changes her life forever. Who would've thought that meeting Miss. Downer would take such a turn of events, but it did. Miss. Downer is that one person that helps Faye be herself and not care what anyone says.

The impact this book has on the reader is that it made me feel grateful for my family and friends. Also it made me feel sad for the girls who really get abused everyday by their family and feel so lonely and insecure that they have to go hurt someone else. I found this book to be very deep and heartfelt when expressing how the main character, Faye, acts unconscious as she go on her journey to make bad decisions that could possibly mess up her future. There are many aspects that will allow this book to have a long lasting value in the world of literature, such as opening people eyes about what really happens to people in the world on a day to day basis.This book is very well written because of the clear and relatable message it has behind it. Also it doesn\u2019t have much difficult vocabulary, which meant it is an easy read. Although this book has a lot of suspenseful and serious moments, the conflict started somewhat quickly in the beginning. Revenge of A Not-So-Pretty Girl is a very Intimate and interesting book. It keeps your attention by constantly giving conflict throughout the whole book. For example in the beginning when Faye wanted feel comfortable with herself, she decided to rob an old lady just to fit in with her friends. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt Ms. Evelyn but I had to do it\u2026If I didn\u2019t do my friends wouldn\u2019t care for me anymore\u201d (Blythe 07)The greatest strength of this book is that it has a very realistic and sparks great emotion for the people who can relate and to those who feel sorry for people who have to go through domestic violence with their family. For example when Faye goes home to her mom after she robbed the old lady she feels scared because she knows when she gets home she will get abused and feel unwanted . \u201cI Know my mom hates me, she lets me know that every night after she beats me\u2026\u201d(Blythe 28). Others can relate to this because people get abused by their family physically and verbally every day and some people suffer from depression and feel unwanted just like Faye. Also this book has a good ending because it shows that Faye was strong enough to get through this situation and find good in herself. Some of the greatest weaknesses were that this story had a misleading title, that didn\u2019t really tell what this book is actually about. I would recommend this book to any adolescent and adult who like realistic and conflicted books. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for a person who may be going through this situation personally because this story can impact sad emotion in some circumstances."}, {"userName": "Wisteriouswoman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4325275-wisteriouswoman", "userReview": "It had me worried in the beginning when I realized that the main character was hanging with a bad crowd. Even so, I stuck with it and was glad to see it is really a book about redemption and restitution. Sometimes our best lessons in life come through the school of hard knocks. But other lessons come from the wisdom of people that have lived hardship themselves. This book could be a learning opportunity for many readers as they see the consequences, for good or evil, of the choices that both Faye and Evelyn make.It shows us the grittier side of town and what life can be like when you don't have loving parents and very few resources to fall back on. Many of Faye's problems stem from the fact that she feels unlovable. I was glad to see that she grows beyond her own limited life view. By the end of the book the reader is fairly confident that Faye will set herself straight and not follow in her mother's footsteps. On the other hand, I can see why redemption comes too late for Evelyn and her relationship with Faye is an act of grace. Evelyn's daughter isn't enthusiastic about seeing her mother. I could totally relate. My mother hasn't come to the place where she can admit she acted horribly and ask for forgiveness. At a certain point the window of opportunity closes and a daughter moves on. We see in Faye's experience as well as Evelyn's that a person has to rise above self-centeredness and find the best in themselves as well as those around them. The 1980s setting, the black girl protagonist, and inner city backdrop really made this book an interesting read--a great contrast to so many teen books about the white cheerleader, the football player and the smart kids stressing over getting into college. Middle class teens that think the idea of failing to get into their choice college is terrifying need to read a book like this that shows plenty of other kids are living with much greater hardship."}, {"userName": "Sherri", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4653528-sherri", "userReview": "It\u2019s 1984 and no matter how much 14-year-old Faye Andrews dreams about Michael Jackson\u2019s moonwalking, whenever she opens her eyes, the despair of her daily life threatens to overwhelm her. Growing up in the slums of Brooklyn, New York with an abusive mother is not easy when you are also trying to survive your freshman year of a Catholic high school. Faye\u2019s stress relief is to take revenge by stealing from pretty girls simply for the reason that they\u2019re white and pretty and she\u2019s black and ugly. One afternoon Faye and two of her thieving friends start robbing an apartment of an elderly white woman who used to be a famous actress. When the actress, Evelyn Downer, tries to stop the girls, Faye instinctively pushes back and knocks the old lady down and rushes out. The next day at school, Faye\u2019s religion class focuses on karma and she begins to wonder about Evelyn. Could Faye have killed her? At first Faye checks up on Evelyn to make sure she\u2019s alive, but she keeps returning to help the old lady around her apartment. Even though Evelyn knows Faye was one of her robbers, the two slowly build a caring relationship together as Evelyn helps Faye blossom into a young lady worth respecting. Teens who like edgy, realistic fiction that\u2019s full of drama and dysfunctional families, will enjoy this book.

When the woman grabs onto to Faye and Faye panics, shoving the woman off of her, she falls and hurts herself. But is she dead? Faye can't stop thinking about whether or not her poor decisions have lead to someone else's downfall.\"Revenge of a Not-So-Pretty Girl\" is an interesting look into urban New York in the 1980s.

The relations of a young teen and a famous oodles woman is very intriguing and how it means that even though in your gut you feel like doing the right thing, it is never to late to change and fix up your mistakes with a little guidance and harsh but helpful help and life advice."}, {"userName": "Erin Schable", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17340128-erin-schable", "userReview": "This book is not just another teen book. It's a journey. It's about how chance meetings change lives, it's about the journey of a delinquent girl into a young woman who may not have had a chance if not for her meeting an old woman and making some selfish choices that ended up not being so selfish. It's about how it's never too late to be touched by someone new no matter how old you are or how hard you try to isolate. It's a beautiful story and I'm happy I read it."}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/174900-autumn", "userReview": "Unusual YA debut about an emotionally detached teenager who learns to open up a little by befriending an old lady she robbed. I really enjoyed the protagonist's tough, world weary stance -- it seemed completely appropriate given her home life. Blythe gently introduces the themes of karma and redemption without undermining her heroine's credibility. Give this to your favorite hard case high schooler and see if they will admit to liking it! Looking forward to more from this author."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3186856-janet", "userReview": "Powerful read about the power of love, of redemption, of family. When Faye and her friends rob and old lady and Fay accidentally knocks her down, she worries about the old lady and goes back to check on her. Thus begins an unusual friendship of two very lonely people. I'll have to admit, I teared up at the end. Great MS read."}, {"userName": "CarrotXD", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52857439-carrotxd", "userReview": "This is one of the books that I've completely fallen for, I would gladly read it again & again. It's not even close to what I'd consider a genre I'd like, but I'm glad I gave it a shot because it took me on a roller coaster ride I'll never forget. The main character's development was encouraging & the plot was unique. Ten out of ten points to Carolita Blythe for writing this master-peace."}, {"userName": "Pam Bohmfalk", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6078680-pam-bohmfalk", "userReview": "While I liked the ultimate message of this title, it seems like it took forever to get to a part I could enjoy. There are lots of discussable issues in this book but there seems to be a lack of focus - sort of like real life I guess. This one just didn't do it for me."}], "description": "Faye doesn't mean to hit the old lady she and her friends are mugging. But she does. The old lady isn't moving, but Faye has no reason to feel guilty for leaving her there. The old lady might be ancient and wrinkly now. But back in the day, she was as beautiful as they come\u2014a famous movie star. And everyone knows that pretty and mean always go together. But Faye does feel guilty. So she comes back. Slowly, Faye and the old lady form an unlikely friendship, one that pulls Faye out of her life with her abusive mother and destructive \"friends\" and allows the old lady relief from her loneliness. But in an unfair world in which the pretty girls, no matter how mean, always seem to get everything, while Faye gets nothing, will Faye be able to keep from slipping back to her old ways? Will her mother ever be happy? Will her father ever come home to stay? And what if Faye goes her whole life without Michael Jackson ever loving her back? Faye is an honest, straightforward narrator who is likable even in her most flawed moments and will be cheered on by readers of every age and from every walk of life.", "title": "Revenge of a Not-So-Pretty Girl", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15755241-revenge-of-a-not-so-pretty-girl", "average": 3.58, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344369846l/15755241.jpg", "reviews": 52, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/745965.Carolita_Blythe", "name": "Carolita Blythe"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Realistic Fiction", "Fiction", "Historical", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15755241-revenge-of-a-not-so-pretty-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15798629-revenge-of-a-not-so-pretty-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1609911.Cricket_s_Serenade", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies"]}
