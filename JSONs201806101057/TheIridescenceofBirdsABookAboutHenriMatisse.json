His art is a joyful mix of fabulous colors and patterns. The Iridescence of Birds is also a joyful mix of fabulous color woodblock prints and Patricia McLachlan's poetic word patterns. The more I read this bright and brief picture book, the more my heart sings with joy over the simple elegance with which author and illustrator celebrate Matisse coming to his art and staying true to his life long vision of creating something beautiful in an often dark and dreary world. I love the fact that McLachlan details the joy his mother brought Matisse in sharing the pleasures of color and pattern with him. Mothers so rarely receive the recognition they deserve. This book begs to be read with a child - or a group of children in an art lesson. It invites conversation, it invites questions and exploration. It invites admiration and a return to Matisse's art! I love the title - The Iridescence of Pigeons...to recognize they are not just pesky gray birds but reflect light in magical ways only the truly observant see. Like children.  There is a wonderful photograph in one of my biographies of Matisse showing him later in life, confined to a wheel chair, surrounded by his birds some of his marvelously creative cut-outs pinned to the walls. I was amused (and happy) to read he gave his pigeons to Picasso on his death. Which reminds me of another delightful children's art book called Pigasso and Mootisie. A wild riot of color, competition, and eventual friendship w mutual admiration."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41583-rebecca", "userReview": "Beautiful! A Caldecott contender for sure. In this picture book biography, Patricia MacLachlan's text is spare and poetic, and Hadley Hooper's illustrations are relief prints further manipulated in Photoshop. They have a soft, retro look. \"I researched and imagined the patterns he might have seen growing up in the textile town of Bohain-en-Vermandois.

The text is a little unorthodox in that most of the book is one long run-on question-- but it works. And the illustrations, oh... gorgeous! Big, bold, expressive. Perfect for a book to introduce Matisse. I love little Henri's joyful engagement with paint and color, and the way he gazes at his older self as a full-fledged artist.

If you have not yet heeded my advice, you really are missing out on some wonderful and informative books. The Iridescence of Birds: A Book About Henri Matisse is a 5-star example of the best in picture book biographies. The book focuses on Matisse's earliest artistic inclinations and influences. Award-winning author Patricia MacLachlan was inspired by a statement by the artist: \"I got my sense of color from my mother.\" Very simple sentences tell the story of Henri and his maman and their life together in a bright home with \"pictures of meadows and trees, rivers and birds\" in a \"dreary town in northern France where the skies were gray.\" The lovely, flowing language would be a perfect read-aloud for ages 4 and up. Equally striking are the illustrations by artist Hadley Hooper. What a daunting task, to illustrate a picture book about this giant of artistic achievement. Hooper carries it off beautifully, creating images that provide a sense -- a taste or an echo -- of Matisse's work, while maintaining her own style. Henri and his mother, their home and town, are darkly outlined and filled with strong earthy tones. Yet the bright, flowing, abstract shapes for which Matisse is famous are apparent in almost collage-like elements throughout the book. I have been to Matisse exhibits, read books about his art, and still learned something new about his life and influences from The Iridescence of Birds. Once again, the children's biography section yields another opportunity to pause for a few minutes to learn while enjoying lovely language and beautiful images."}, {"userName": "babyhippoface", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/282057-babyhippoface", "userReview": "I cannot imagine an elementary art teacher anywhere in America who, upon seeing this book for the first time, would not declare with wide open eyes, I have got to have this book. It's wonderful!The story is all about how looking at the world around you can inspire creativity and dreaming. Hadley Hooper's illustrations, done in relief printing, are absolutely beautiful, whether it is in the big blocks of color, or the intricate designs. The author's and illustrator's notes at the back of the book give insight into the book's creation, and while kids are most likely to skip right over this page, adults--especially art teachers--will want to give special attention to it for the artists' explanations of why they made the decisions they did, and how they researched before and during the building of this book. Although it was not enough to make me a fan of Matisse's art, which I've never really liked, this is a wonderful introduction for children to the French painter."}, {"userName": "Ellen Ramsey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835344-ellen-ramsey", "userReview": "What is most remarkable about this remarkable book is how beautifully MacLachlan's text and Hooper's illustrations blend to create the visually spectacular world of young Henri Matisse. It's a world filled with the colors of red rugs on the floors and hung on the walls, the colors of plates painted by his mother and filled with meadows and trees, rivers and birds (and his mother let young Henri mix the paints!). And Henri raised pigeons and marveled at the way their colors changed with the light\u2014thus the iridescence of birds. Having just seen the exhibit of Matisse cutouts at MOMA in NYC, I was eager to read this book and become immersed in Matisse's world\u2014and the book provides just that experience."}, {"userName": "Erin Buhr", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15387172-erin-buhr", "userReview": "A mesmerizing book about a young Henri Matisse and what inspired him to become the fine painter the world remembers. Patricia MacLachlan beautifully describes how a small boy in France can want to fill his gray world with color and is inspired and encouraged by his artistic mother. The text is brief and accessible to young children, but MacLachlan graces it with phrases and words like \"the iridescence of birds\" that sound like a painting and stay on the mind long after you close the pages. Meticulously researched illustrations utilize the relief painting method and reflect Matisse's style with lines and colors that draw you into the pages. Together this is a masterpiece, much like Matisse's paintings, and a fitting tribute that will likely inspire another generation of creative souls."}, {"userName": "Kristine Hansen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1952643-kristine-hansen", "userReview": "While I really loved the illustrations (and the work the illustrator put into this - the note at the back amazed me. Such dedication!) the format of the text being one long sentence annoyed me enough to drop this one star. I DO love the story itself - on how Matisse pulled things from his childhood to put into his art. I think that this book gives an excellent introduction to Matisse and is something I think my budding artist daughter will love when I share it with her. Children's picture book biographies are really awesome!

The back matter does a nice job of putting into context how Matisse's early life shaped his art and the Fauvist movement.I do think the nudity would be distracting to kids of the age this book is aimed at. Preschoolers are more likely to scream \"ew\" than understand the important of painting nudes in art.The illustrations make this close to a four, although I don't think this book stands alone - I would really only want to discuss it in combination with some actual work by Matisse."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/271355-jess", "userReview": "This picture book biography is an interesting contrast to The Noisy Paint Box: The Colors and Sounds of Kandinsky's Abstract Art. Both are about artists and their early inspirations, both are very approachable for a child audience. Personally, I clicked more with Hooper's relief prints than I did with GrandPre's paintings - but then, I also prefer Matisse to Kandinsky, so I'm definitely coming from a place of personal preference over artistic merit. I loved the texture here, especially in the textiles, and the contrast between the restrained color of the early pages and the increased vibrancy as Henri begins to play with color. The shocking red-orange endpapers are also a great contrast to the mostly cool cover. There's a page at the end with notes from author and illustrator, along with some suggested reading. I think this could be enjoyed on its own, as a story, but also inspire readers to delve deeper into Matisse's art."}, {"userName": "Marya", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/915736-marya", "userReview": "Meh. The pictures are, of course, nice, but it doesn't answer the basic questions the little ones have about Art. Namely:1. Who is this Matisse guy? The way the story is written, he could just have easily been any other protagonist who paints in any other picture book. There's nothing unique about him, which leads to question 22. Why do I care? If the answer is \"because his works are in the art museum\", there's no \"why his art is in the art museum\" follow up. 3. If the kid is just meant to enjoy the pretty pictures, then why even bother with a book about Matisse? Why not use any other illustrator and tell the same story?4. But I'll give you that I almost never use the word iridescence except when reading this book."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "In engaging prose and through lovely illustrations created using relief printmaking and digital techniques, the author and illustrator provide insight into the influences on artist Henri Matisse. The importance of is mother is made quite clear as she added color to his life. The family lived in somewhat dreary conditions, but the woman painted plates to brighten up the walls and encouraged him to notice the iridescence of the birds that filled the streets and the air. This approach, while not the typical scholarly examination of an artist's formative years, works quite effectively, and in a sense, provides far more insight into this talented artist than other, more weighty tomes might.

I think they may get lost but still may enjoy the rhythm. Since the whole point seems to be that Matisse painted the iridescence of birds, I just don't see it in the illustrations. I looked at images of his some of his work, and they seem more colorful than the illustrations here. The text does not refer to his illness, and the slight references to it in the author's note confused me more than informed me. For both the art and the text, I felt I needed to go to other sources to more fully understand."}, {"userName": "Christine Turner", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1171422-christine-turner", "userReview": "If you were a boy named Henri Matisse who lived in a dreary town in northern France, what would your life be like?
