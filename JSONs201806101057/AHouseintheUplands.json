I guess it's a \"classic\" because it's so typical of a genre of best-sellers that continues to this day. Even the prose has the flat, descriptive tone of the sort of popular writing that has to tell you exactly what the characters are thinking: \"It was an anguish she did not know how to endure... what was more important right then than anything else was to find out whether her suspicions were true or false...\" etc. This being published in 1946, there's no actual sex, like there undoubtedly would be now -- we have to content ourselves with our heroine being carried, trembling, in the brawny arms of her neighbor, etc. There's literally a bodice ripped at one point, although with much more anger than lust. (The other difference is that such a story nowadays would be very unlikely to be frank about the racial relations on the plantation. There's no glossing over attitudes or censorship of language. The author obviously thinks that the black characters, in the words of the modern cousin, \"have certain fundamental rights\", but his depiction of them is just as clich\u00e9ed as everything else here, and thus necessarily racist.) The theme of the decline and fall of old power in the south is a familiar one too. If I \"recognize\" things in this book constantly, it's most likely because others imitated it, rather than it being an imitation."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11908543-sarah", "userReview": "I nearly killed myself while I was reading this book. 2 thumbs down."}, {"userName": "Amerynth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2993355-amerynth", "userReview": "Boy, I really didn't like Erskine Caldwell's \"A House in the Uplands.\" It was all melodrama, and not even fun melodrama at that.Simpering Lucyanne loves her husband, who is a cheating bastard that beats her up.

There is not a single character who redeems themselves by the end of this story, including the \"heroine\" who (spoilers!) spends the vast majority of the story pining after her drunken, wife-beating husband when she should be high-tailing it out of the county to live with her parents. Misogyny aside, the book is laced with racism that appears there just to reflect the norms of the community in which the story takes place and hammer it into our heads that Grady is a drunken racist in too many passages. There is but one scene worth reading (the exchange between the lawyer and the judge), but by then it had been an exercise simply to finish the book than anything else. One could argue that it was a story of its time (that being 1947), but I can't even imagine bored housewives consuming this. One of the worse books I have ever read. I would have given it half a star if I could for the aforementioned scene with the judge. Stay away. Far away."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1202795-james", "userReview": "A per usual, a very quick and easy read, a typical Caldwell style read and book.

All of the usual Caldwell elements go into the making of this story: poverty; racism; ignorance; prejudice of every kind. But I detected one newer element\u2014at least in the dozen or so novels of Caldwell I\u2019ve so far been privileged to read and review: class warfare. And in this case, it\u2019s a matter of once wealthy (though now decadent and on the edge of their own poverty) Southern whites versus what these same would-be aristocrats refer to as a \u201clow-white\u201d class. It\u2019s just one more sorry ingredient in the whole pathetic porridge, and Caldwell is the master-chef at making us taste every nuance of that porridge.RRBBrooklyn, NY20 April 2019"}, {"userName": "Micha\u0142 Gajewski", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49831746-micha-gajewski", "userReview": "A rather depressing account of the paupered South with egntlemen turned into gamblers and chivalry into cruelty towards women."}], "description": "", "title": "A House in the Uplands", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2602928-a-house-in-the-uplands", "average": 3.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1223319799l/2602928.jpg", "reviews": 10, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17326.Erskine_Caldwell", "name": "Erskine Caldwell"}], "type": ["Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2602928-a-house-in-the-uplands", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8621908-the-house-in-the-uplands", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12428259-una-casa-en-la-colina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59091.Tobacco_Road", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/191581.God_s_Little_Acre", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/191578.Trouble_in_July", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/191577.Journeyman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93255.Georgia_Boy"]}
