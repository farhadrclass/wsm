I found myself rolling my eyes through out the book because it was so predictable (Talk about the stars constantly lining up to the point of drab). I would have liked a little more detail in the characters (I may have missed the one line that describes the color of Delphines hair, so I imagined it blonde until I changed my mind half way through the book) and I never got a clear delicious vision of Brad Larsen. I think it's probably a cute story for a 9th grader. Very rated G. Not enough heat and flame for the type of books I like to read. By time I got to the very last words of the book, the story turned into a Disney animated film with a \"and they lived Happily Ever After... The End\", Music an all."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4708602-kimberly", "userReview": "This was a cute book, however, I should warn the readers not to read it while on a diet.

(It\u2019s complicated but that\u2019s a good thing)Delphine D\u2019Arneux, in Belgium to learn the fine art of chocolate candy from the best, encounters young, carefree Brad Larson, on vacation with his parents. A \u2018chocoholic\u2019 in the worst sense, Brad is also attracted to the lovely but serious Delphine and attempts to snatch a kiss but gets soundly slapped for his brazen effort. Smitten, Brad longs to see her again to apologize for his indiscretion.He gets his chance at the Paris airport where they meet again. On her way back to California, an airline computer glitch forces her to buy a one way ticket. When she attempts to use her credit card, she learns her account has been drained, but by whom? It happens to be her lovable but totally irresponsible French parents who have squandered the money at a local casino. Enter Brad\u2019s parents who are affluent and influential. Against her protests, they buy her a return ticket.Delphine\u2019s dream is to open a candy shop featuring the finest gourmet chocolates but her small business loan is turned down. Brad\u2019s parents come to the rescue once again by offering her a personal loan to get her shop off the ground. Wary, suspicious, and intensely private, Delphine initially distrusts Brad\u2019s family and their offer of friendship and financial assistance. At opposite ends of the lifestyle spectrum, Delphine has struggled with her parent\u2019s child-like irresponsibility with money since she was a child and shuttled with them from one temporary home to another, one step ahead of being evicted for non-payment of rents and escaping their creditors. Brad, on the other hand, has lived a life of privilege and has never known the suffering that Delphine has.Delphine is drawn to handsome Brad\u2019s sunny disposition, positive outlook, and his strength. Brad is drawn to Delphine\u2019s beauty, her iron will to be financially independent, and her skill with chocolate!How are these two polar opposites going to grow their relationship in the face of constant obstacles, both financial and personal? Delphine wavers between affection and distrust of Brad, thinking his love must come with financial strings attached.As in most romances, the outcome is seldom in doubt but the author\u2019s convoluted journey to get there is wrought with suspense, ardor, humor and God\u2019s over-arching plan to get Delphine to give up her world-weariness and trust Him for the outcome.The book is not a lengthy read but went even faster than usual for this reader because it was such a suspenseful page-turner. I also enjoyed the author\u2019s use of italics which served to highlight the principal\u2019s private thoughts, provided insight, and enhanced the comical misunderstandings between hero and heroine. I cannot remember rooting harder for a young heroine than I did Delphine!This was my first read by author Bonnie Blythe and I look forward to more of her sweet faith-based stories."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11818290-sarah", "userReview": "1/4 - I haven't actually started this yet, but I just wanted to note that it's my first 'christian' romance and I'm not sure how I'm going to like it (first sign of preaching and the first star is going).5/4 - The guy, Brad, is a naive idiot and I hate lines like \"What could be negative on so beautiful a day-in Europe no less?\" Ugh, what did the much more sympathetic female character call his words? That's right, \"Trite\". I would add sickly sweet and it's lines like these that give romance books a bad name. What's up with the front cover? That little brown spot on the corner of the guy's mouth doesn't look like a chocolate flake/crumb/piece/whatever, especially when you see the enlarged version of it. It looks more like a sultana or bread crumb got squashed into the cover of the physical book and then they scanned the cover as is - not alluring at all. It makes me think of a boy with a grubby face who needs his mother to spit onto a hanky and clean his face for him.P.S. Does \"much needed cachet\" from page 14 actually translate to \"much needed cash\"? If so I have serious doubts about Blythe's writing skills. To be continued...25/07 - Yes, I'm still struggling through this. This was supposed to be my book dessert and so, I was expecting a sweet romance with a chocolate creme centre, instead I got a doughy, under-cooked doughnut that's missing the sprinkles. I'm at that point where you're still trying to chew the dough, not sure if you can stomach finishing the mouthful, but not disgusted enough to spit it out; you're stuck between a squishy rock and a spongey hard place not sure what to do. To be continued...(if I can keep chewing)5/09 - I've given up on this one. I've found I'm not in the least bit interested in the fate of either character and find Brad too sickly sweet and Delphine is snarky with a side of irritating - neither my cup of hot chocolate. After my last post I was going to attempt to make it to 50%, alas my jaw is tired from attempting to chew through this one so I'm onto something a bit more digestible."}, {"userName": "Valerie (Val's Vicinity)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8561323-valerie-val-s-vicinity", "userReview": "Stories about chocolate are usually just too sweet for me to pass up, and initially this one started out fairly fun. Though a bit unrealistic in spots, I still found it amusing to watch as Delphine tried to dodge and hide from Brad--a basic stranger who had kissed her on the street--and then ultimately ended up on a plane with a ticket purchased for her by Brad's parents!I do have to admit that it seemed slightly odd for Brad--a guy--to be such a hopeless chocolate-lover...but this probably stems from the guys in my life being just \"so-so\" about sweets. Regardless of that, I found it quite interesting when Delphine tried to teach Brad about higher grades of chocolate and the fine quality differences. However, much to my chagrin, every time chocolate came into the scene Brad managed to end up with some on his face. I'm sure this is meant to be endearing, but I just wanted to give him a stack of napkins and tell him to clean up.Despite a few nitpicks, I honestly enjoyed the first half of the story, but at roughly the half-way point things started to changed. Suddenly the plot's main focus seemed to be about Delphine and Brad both doubting and fearing their affection wasn't mutual. Even after they'd said \"I love you\" multiple times, they both still continued to wonder if the other was truly earnest in their feelings. This got rather old, and ultimately after so many repetitions of doubts and confirmed feelings, more doubts and more confirmed feelings, I was just ready for the story to be done so I could move on to something else.Overall, I feel the story would be much stronger if it was shortened up and condensed, mainly in the latter half when the redundancy of doubts begins. If you're looking to try a book by Bonnie Blythe, instead of \"How Sweet It Is\" I would recommend checking out Claire's Not-So-Gothic Romance, which I found to be very entertaining from beginning to end."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1215740-amanda", "userReview": "This one began with a few too many coincidences. They met in a foreign country, but happen to be practically neighbors back home in the states. Plus the whole he kissed a near stranger to get chocolate off her face thing was not realistic. I kept reading despite the early eye rolls because I\u2019ve read a few other Bonnie Blythe books that I enjoyed (Claire\u2019s Not So Gothic Romance is still my favorite.). And I thought the story picked up considerably as soon as they got back home. The writing kept me interested and the subplot of opening the chocolate shop flowed well. I believe the best part of the book was an actually believable misunderstanding between the main couple. I\u2019ve read many books where the major source of conflict between the hero and heroine could (and should) have been cleared up by a simple conversation and this one made me believe the reasons these two didn\u2019t have that conversation. It went on for a while, but alternated between the man and woman\u2019s perspective to keep my interest. Biggest gripe was way that both characters had food on their faces more than once. Get some napkins people."}, {"userName": "Fiona", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4518675-fiona", "userReview": "Delphine meets brad in belgium after studying how to make chocolates.

She meets a 20-something retired surfer in Paris who lives with his parents. When surfer dude meets the heroine, sparks fly on his end and he's smitten. Heroine isn't as enthralled with the surfer dude although he helps her get out of a major scrape and is very supportive of her business venture.The H/H act more like teenagers and this has a very YAish tone to it. The heroine comes across to prim and proper and even calls the heroine by mister so and so, which seems strange. Also the way faith and religion is handled is well balanced. There are many cute and awww that's so sweet moments.I would recommend this for anyone looking for a \"sweet\" read.

I enjoyed that they were given time to get to know each other although there were very few romance/love scenes anyhow. Delphine really tried my patience a time or two. I understood her need to do things on her own and to stand on her own feet and not wanting to owe anybody but there comes a time when you have to hang up the pride and let other folks in to help.
