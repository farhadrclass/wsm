Ship going through the fog at night, and as the fog clears - there is the Statue of Liberty looming overhead with people milling about the island just like any other day in New York City - except it's at night...and those people aren't tourists anymore.I was ready for a Zombie book. I loved World War Z! I dug the premise - teenage girl army, with a native New Yorker (and UN worker) as a guide - on a mission to get AIDS drugs for their beloved leader - to Zombie filled New York (because the United Nations has the largest, most secure stash of AIDS drugs). Super fun and creepy, right?And it was! It was great!Right up until the moment a few still sentient zombies founded a freaky zombie religion, and the mummies in the Egyptian section of the Metropolitan Museum woke up and started jiggling around in their mummified coffins.Just take a minute to let that whole sentence marinate...now,[Cue the Price is Right you-just-lost-the-car music:]. I know! How do you get over a monkey wrench like that? And if I pissed off the spoiler police - I say I'm doing a service for my fellow readers by trying to save them from buying the book like I did. Read it if you want, but for Zombie-loving sakes don't pay for it!Here's this other little thing that happened while reading this that kinda messed up my whole Zombie apocalyptic universe. My husband used the leaf blower and decided to borrow the electric outlet from the freezer in our garage, and then forgot to plug the freezer back in. Yeah. Well, we are out in the driveway, with the gloves, the scrub brushes, the bleach, the hose, the triple bagged, heavy duty trash bags, etc. We opened the lid to start unloading all that once, lovely meat, and I think it took less than three minutes for our driveway to look like something out of Amityville Horror. Every fly in the county was there to party. Eleventy billion flies didn't help with the gag factor one bit, I'll just say that.A couple of hours later, with a scrubbed freezer full of charcoal and baking soda (which works by the way) - freshly showered and downing my third beer - it occurred to me that 1) the zombie apocalypse is going to smell REALLY bad, and 2) you would hear and see the hoard of flies long before any zombie could possibly sneak up on you.That's what's missing from all the zombie books, movies and video games - the flies.Fellow readers, if you have a recommendation to put me back on the proper Zombie path, I would love to hear it."}, {"userName": "Kerry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/343018-kerry", "userReview": "Read this online. I'm not interested in zombies per se, but I do like post-apocalyptic stories.Ugh. I mean I got all the way through it, so it wasn't the WORST book in the world. And there were some interesting parts. But overall the thing felt very amateurish, it read like fan fiction. Any hard facts that were in there sounded like stuff the author already knew, random shit about guns and NYC locations. The characters were inconsistent, and the \"explanation\" for the zombies felt very much like something somebody in high school would make up.Also he used \"discrete\" when he meant \"discreet\" TWICE."}, {"userName": "pinkgal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7577-pinkgal", "userReview": "Darn it! It's so hard to find a good zombie novel these days! This follows the current trend where zombies aren't just zombies; they're actually demons from another dimension/world. It pisses me off, because then there's no real point in even trying to win since the one advantage humans have over zombies is the brain portion. One good thing; the idea of being dead but retaining your own mind. And the hunger.

How well does he do? Well, for the most part he does very well indeed.First off he chucks the incongruous team of a UN Weapons Inspector and a group of female Somalian child-soldiers into New York City, on a quest to find AIDS medicines for an ailing third-world Warlord. If that isn't entertainingly ludicrous enough, the main baddie turns out to be a Zombie who has not only retained his marbles while passing beyond the veil of death, but also can mind-control literally thousands of the more dumb-ass dead to do his evil bidding. As it turns out, his bidding is very very evil indeed. If that's all the book had going for it, we'd be in 2-star territory but thanks to the author's own extensive knowledge of New York and the UN, he is able to add a remarkable level of verisimilitude which juxtaposes nicely with the loony storyline.Unfortunately, no 5-stars for Mr Wellington, partly due to his horrendous characters (you WILL want to gut 'Marisol' with a fish-knife) and their godawful, totally unnaturalistic dialogue. Mostly though because the main baddie of the piece comes from the school of cackling evil-doers who would kick the face off of a puppy for the hell of it and then make a bad pun afterwards. It's a mark of an extremely lazy author who makes his villains extra-villainouss just by giving them a sick sense of humour.It's a real shame that an original and captivating plot is hamstrung by ham-fisted writing and hammy dialogue. Now that's an awful lot of ham."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg", "userReview": "I went into reading this figuring it would be a semi-mindless but fun read, and to my surprise it turned out to be much better than I expected.

From a promising beginning one month after your everyday undead apocalypse, he takes us all around the world, following a young woman coping with her new state of \"life\", a group of rag-tag soldiers chasing medicine for their leader, and one man who might be the key to everything, but is rapidly leaving his humanity in the dust.Initially created as an online serial novel (there's a lot of that going around), Monster Island had quite a following largely due to the fact that it featured brains and the eating thereof. My generation is exceptionally fond of zombies, and there's nothing wrong with that. For a while, Wellington appears to understand the key things that make any zombie story good. There are a lot of tense moments, a lot of grotesque imagery, and a lot of people eaten in very unpleasant ways. The cast is never particularly interesting, but hey; they're just zombie fodder anyway, right? So for the first third or so, the book is fairly decent.And then he has to go and add telekinetic mummies to the mix. In case that didn't hit you with the full force of its ridiculousness, let me try again, in caps; TELEKINETIC MUMMIES. It's just the tip of a big, stupid, silly iceberg of strange ideas that begins to surface and sink the story. The few interesting characters die off, those remaining start feeling more and more like they were written expressly with summer action movie casting in mind, and the whole thing feels like about halfway through the writing, Wellington got up and left it in the hands of a group of ten-year-olds. The few interesting and not completely ridiculous plot threads that remained at the end of the book unfortunately weren't enough to spur me to seek out the rest of the series. I can't say I regret the time I spent reading it (that honour is reserved for books by Mister Laymond), but it definitely isn't the deepest fish in the pond. Pick it up if you're looking for the literary equivalent of a fan-made Bruce Campbell movie, but steer clear if you're looking for something meatier."}, {"userName": "Elf M.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6826433-elf-m", "userReview": "I've just finished reading Monster Island, which has to be one of the best, most unapologetic zombie books ever written. After the big brouhaha last year in which some NY Review of Books reviewer didn't \"get\" the whole zombie thing, looking desperately for allegory and meaning in the zombie genre (and to which David Langford gleefully pointed out \"They don't have to be an allegory. They're zombies. They eat people. What more do you need?\") it's refreshing to read a really gross, horrifying, not at all uplifting novel about zombies.Monster Island begins six months after the End of the World. The Epidemic, in which the dead shamble along meaninglessly, trying to eat the living, has taken over. Our hero, Dekalb, is a UN Weapons Inspector in Africa when the Epidemic breaks out. Dispatched by a third world dictator to New York, holding his daughter hostage as ransom for reasons that I will not give away, Dekalb meets Gary, the world's smartest dead man, the last Prestident of the United States, and Jack, the last Special Forces operative in New York. Battling zombies (human and animal) and even encountering the long-mummified remains of Egyptian Kings and Welsh Druids, Dekalb comes to and understanding that the Epidemic is something more than merely a disease. And maybe, just maybe, he might understand it well enough to give the living a chance.It was a fabulous read. I sailed along and loved every minute of it. There are moments in the book when the author intrudes with lines like \"Sorry, won't be releasing this week, at a con,\" that made me understand exactly where we CC people are going. The battle scenes and adventure just move and Gary's really a very funny guy. Even if he is dead."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6371997-lauren", "userReview": "I know zombies are far fetched (which doesn't stop me loving them). But David Wellington takes it to a whole new level, bordering on being plain stupid. It's poorly written but the plot itself irked me to the point I wondered why I was still reading it. I don't like the idea of a walking/talking zombie, I never really have, but I like the idea of ancient Egyptian mummies still being able to walk around even less. Not to mention the random Scottish ghost/thing that, for some reason, could control all the zombies, communicate through telepathy and bring zombies back to (un)life. Or that really stupid scene in which a zombie rips someone intestines out by just swiping him with its nails. Or the fact that some of the zombies ended up about 10 feet tall because apparently humans can spontaneously grow 4/5 feet based on their diet. It's stupid, too stupid for me to take it seriously and read the other two books. And too stupid for me to give it anything other than one star."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1825627-tom", "userReview": "This book was apparently first published online, and it shows. The chapters are all between 4-6 pages in length and the characterization is about as thin. The characterization in this book is so thin, its friends fear it might be anorexic. Twiggy wishes she was this thin in her prime. This lack of character development and other details make the book's characters hard to get into, and whatever interesting ideas Wellington has (and he has more than a few) are squashed by my inability to feel any sympathy for anyone in the book. Motivation is basic, and the book might actually read better as a Hollywood screenplay. There's plenty there for that: zombies, uniformed schoolgirls with machine guns, 'splosions, basic motivations. Anyone who just wants an action-packed book will be OK. Anyone who wants anything more will be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "When I first saw this title I presumed it was about a bunch of giant nuclear radiated creatures who occasionally attack Tokyo. Instead, it is a book about a bunch of diseased undead that attack New York. Not that I was disappointed since I am big fan of the zombie genre. David Wellington's book starts out like a lot of traditional zombie tales, with those that remain after the undead holocaust doing whatever it takes to survive. In this case, a group of Somali schoolgirls armed to the teeth head to NYC with a former UN Weapons Inspector as their tour guide with the goal of getting much needed medical supplies to their ailing Warlord. In this universe the only places safe for humans are those where everyone was already armed and ready for battle before things fell apart. Thus the U.S. is toast but a chaotic and violence plagued place like Somali is prepared for the worst and is doing fairly well. It certainly makes some sense given the circumstances. The story takes a turn with the introduction of Gary, an undead fellow who has the unique ability to talk and think. He is later joined by some ancient mummies and an undead scottsman that have some plans for this new world. It was certainly interesting to explore the idea of the ancient dead coming back to life as well as the freshly killed. Throw in some more survivors hiding out on Manhattan and you have the cast for this creative tale. Overall, the writing style was easy to digest and the story went along smoothly. I was able to get through the book fairly quickly and it certainly was entertaining. It was a fun read. The criticisms I have here are related to some of the newer concepts delved into here. Don't get me wrong, the ideas were interesting and I am always up for something different. There were just a few areas that needed some more work in my humble opinion. I would have liked more depth to the explanation for the ancient undead and the supernatural reasoning behind the undead uprising. The author casually tosses in a few undead animals which was ok on its own, but wasn't elaborated on with much detail. It felt as if they were inserted as a convenience. I would have preferred more detailed explanations (as is the case in Brian Keene's \"The Rising\" and \"City of the Dead\") or if they were left out altogether. Finally, while I did find it interesting that the undead actually processing the flesh they devour to keep the rot down instead of it just passing through their system unused, I felt the idea of some zombies growing incredibly large (not just bigger, but taller) seemed a bit much. Most of these criticisms are me being nitpicky. I just prefer more detail when certain things like the above are introduced. Afterall, anything is feasible in a universe where the dead walk...and even perhaps talk. But if a new turn is introduced, I appreciate as much detail as I can get as to why it was thrust into the plot. A fun book and a author who kept my attention from start to finish. Creative for sure even though I wasn't totally hooked on some of the ideas. Definitely worth the time and effort and I look forward to the sequels."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2850786-jennifer", "userReview": "David Wellington originally published Monster Island, as well as many of his other books, online in a serial format. Had I realized that before buying the book, I would have checked out his website first, as it is still available as a free read. As I've said many times in the past, I am not a zombie purist. I love when authors get creative with the mythology and traits of their zombies, just as long as they still want to eat people. Monster Island has cannibalistic zombies, which immediately put it ahead of some others I have read. It also have a very original story line including a UN weapons inspector who has left his daughter behind in what was once Somalia under the care of a female warlord, while returning to New York in search of drugs which will ensure both of their freedoms.The book was progressing nicely when one of the zombies showed awareness. If done well, in a realistic fashion, this can make a book outstanding. Unfortunately, Monster Island's intelligent zombie went beyond awareness and became something more, something further along the line of supernatural with powers previously unseen in my zombie readings, and sadly it just didn't work for me. While still a zombie novel at heart, strayed too far away from the monsters at its core and became something other.Monster Island is well written and is a good horror story. As a strictly zombie story, it leaves something to be desired. Had I known going into the reading that the story would evolve into something different, I may have enjoyed it more, but for much of the book I was left wondering when we were going to get back to the real zombies. I'll most likely skip the rest of the trilogy."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2127955-holly", "userReview": "Where do i even begin with this review?I have to say i was slightly hesitant to read this, considering the multitude of negative reviews i have read for this, and the other 2 books in the series.

The first half of this book played like a dark, unnerving film in my head as i was reading it, and i thought to myself 'Man, those people who said this book sucked, didn't know what they were talking about.'And then things started to fall apart.The originally exciting concept of a functioning zombie, spirals into the absurd when the whole 'mystical' element involving an ancient druid, and re-animated mummies came into play. The actual ending of the book was confusing and disjointed and left me more than a little bit pissed off.I plan on reading the subsequent books in the trilogy ~ Monster Nation & Monster Planet, if for no other reason than in the hopes that Wellington's ability to follow through with a story, improves in the long run."}, {"userName": "Amy-chan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30176524-amy-chan", "userReview": "Yo esperaba de este libro una historia de zombies (como su nombre indica) no un pupurri de zombies, druidas escoceses y momias del antiguo Egipto.

His and his daughter\u2019s benefactor, the only one keeping them alive in this post-apocalyptic nightmare, needs medical supplies and the only, potentially, reachable source is in the UN Building. A cadre of devoted teens go with him into the dead city. One head shot, one kill. Get in. Get the supplies. Get out. Only a zombie master has arisen, one who can control the mindless. He is coalescing an army of his own, an army dedicated to feeding his hungers._________________________________________________Genre:LiteratureFictionGenre FictionMashupsHorrorOccult________________________________________________Least Favorite Character: Gary after his re-rebirth and betrayal. His actions through the final climax are more supervillain than you would have supposed based on how he acted in the first half of the book. His character arc went light, dark, darker. And it\u2019s not the character arc that I\u2019m put off by, the character doesn\u2019t ring true throughout.Character I Most Identified With:I ided with DeKalb, the hero, cliche I know. But I didn\u2019t understand the way he did, personality wise, some of the things he did. But taken in the context of his having been a UN weapons inspector, his actions make sense.The Feel:This never really gave me that I\u2019m-about-to-be-eaten feel that the majority of zombie fiction did. The story lived more in DeKalb\u2019s almost PTSD brain, tired, worn out.Favorite Scene / Quote:The opening where the ship slips passed Liberty Island and the narrator dwells on the Statue\u2019s oath interspersed with the dead and zombies.A mercy eating...sort of, with an intelligent zombie and the child soldiers in a Virgin Megastore in NYC. Wow.Plot Holes/Out of Character:How quickly the girls went from thinking DeKalb a coward after the hospital incident to his being the leader after what happened to Ifiyah.The hazmat walk across NYC may be a good idea. But, logistically, and this is coming from a non-New Yorker, their walk would have made more sense if instead of going around Manhattan to the western shore, they had landed at another place on the east and gone up the FDR to the UN Headquarters building.Hmm Moments:So, Gary isn\u2019t a mutant or a naturally occurring different type of zombie, He actively worked to prevent brain damage when he crossed over. Interesting.Three theories on who or what The Benefactor is. Not going to ruin it, but one is a bit too classic, one is a bit too modern, and the other a bit too psychological. Bet I\u2019m on the money, but with two more books in the series, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019ll be explained in these pages. I was wrong. Not sure how I feel about the character.Zomcat and Zompigeons, never saw that coming.WTF Moments:Homo Sapiens Inmortuae are better done here than I\u2019ve seen elsewhere. Not sure about the eidicth or whatever they alternatively call the web connecting the dead. Would make sense if there were though. Look at the way that almost everyone has them respond to what one sees, almost a hive mind. Seen it explained away as that moan drawing others to them, but this hivemind spiritual connection actually makes more sense, in a fantastic, horrific way.Meh / PFFT Moments:Knew the hazmat suits were a bad idea. Didn\u2019t expect the Governor-esque subway dwellers. I\u2019m calling them g-esque because of how hard that is being telegraphed. They have a real fear the living vibe to them.Wisdom:Saw it coming at the end, but it would be an option.Why isn\u2019t there a screenplay?In our over-zombie movie and television flood, I doubt it will make it. But, they could. Doubt it would be made. Casting call / Dreamcasting:Rhona Mitra as Marisol.Karl Urban as DeKalb. He could use his real accent that almost never shows up in his performances.Not sure if he could pull it off, but I keep seeing David Spade as Gary. He could bring a stitch to the character which might make it better through the performance.Sean Connery\u2019s voice for the Druid. Make him completely CGI._________________________________________________Last Page Sound:I was ready to hate the ending when I started the last page. Blame zombie fiction fatigue. I love zombie fiction, but too often, they hang it on a bad cliffhanger or come to an unsatisfactory ending with authors who fail to realize that they aren\u2019t George Romero. Surprisingly, no hate here. Bravo!Author Assessment:Good stuff. I\u2019ll be looking up the others in this series and other stuff by this author.Knee Jerk Reaction:really good bookDisposition of Book:Irving Public LibraryValley Ranch CampusIrving, TXDewey Decimal System: FWELWould recommend to:genre fans_________________________________________________"}, {"userName": "K.

Though his options are slim, giving her the \"opportunity\" to join the Somali all-girls army (run by a female warlord) is better than letting her die. In the very least she'll learn the fighting skills her new world requires. But the Somali's don't trust Americans and only agree to take her in if Dekalb can provide them with medicine. After confirming nearly every hospital has been totally ransacked, Dekalb mentions in passing the only place he knows where to find them: the Secretariat Building in New York City. Days later, he is thrust into the middle of Manhattan and the million-plus zombies roaming there along with a small brigade of teenage girls packing AK-47s. This scenario sounds ridiculous, and perhaps it is. What's worse is the number of grammatical mistakes I found in the early goings (I'm talking wrong genders on the pronouns not simple typos). However when Wellington introduces his antagonist-to-be, Gary, the novel begins to shine...Gary is- or rather *was*- a med student and one of the last survivors holed up in New York. Though he doesn't seem to be intellectually superior (it's assumed common sense and dumb luck have kept him alive), he did have one brilliant notion. He realizes that the reason the undead act as so many mindless corpses is because the brain dies along with the body when the infection sets in. He then goes about procuring a dialysis machine and other abandoned, high-tech medical equipment, hooks himself up, and (rationalizing that his death is inevitable- a notion as equally stupid as his other one was brilliant), he then gets purposely infected. The result is nothing short of fantastic. Gary wakes to find his body is dead but his brain is alive. He has retained everything about himself that was ever human. His knowledge, his memories, his reasoning skills, perhaps even his soul. Everything. He can even talk. Of course there are down sides that come with being undead such as seeing his body slowly deteriorate, his hands lose their fine motor skills, the insatiable hunger that is so much more powerful than he had given it credit, and of course the small army of machine-gun-toting teenie-boppers who both want to kill him and prove he could have been saved *alive* if only he had held out a few more days. The character of Gary was unique, fund to read, and progressed nicely into a true antagonist to Dekalb and his crew, despite making early and somewhat amiable contact with them. Dekalb's story, however, remained only a little above par, and the aforementioned grammar issues also detracted from the story. I seriously considered giving this only 2 stars, but Gary's uniqueness won me over. While there are 2 more books in this series (Monster Nation & Monster Planet), I'm not in a big hurry to gobble them up. Perhaps if my next zombie read doesn't satisfy I'll give Wellington another go."}, {"userName": "Paul Hamilton", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2363813-paul-hamilton", "userReview": "A decent zombie tale overall, but many of the mystical elements that power the undead in this book feel a little undeveloped. Perhaps it is that they are presented in a very deus ex machina fashion that allows them to be whatever is necessary for the progression of the plot, but while a departure from the trendy virus explanation is nice, this feels a bit hokey.In many ways the book reads like a novelization of a video game or a B-grade film, with some odd stylistic choices and a peculiar bit of character development where only a few secondary characters ever seem to act consistently. Especially vexing are the fourth-wall-breaking final passages which seem only to serve to set up a (frankly unnecessary) sequel.As an avowed fan of zombie stories, it certainly held my interest throughout but I can't really recommend it to anyone who doesn't share an interest in tales of the walking dead, and even then there are much better places to start."}, {"userName": "Agoaye Leblog", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29492959-agoaye-leblog", "userReview": "L'histoire de survivants dans une Am\u00e9rique post apocalyptique peupl\u00e9e de zombies.Mmmmmbof.

I had bought them on a day trip to that world of books, Haye-on-Wye. Together they make up an interesting and innovative take on the zombie apocalypse genre. If you like this kind of escapist fiction then I really recommend this trilogy, and I should add that any of the books can be read standalone, though obviously reading them all does add some extra context.Monster Island shows us a world over-run by the undead, set in New York a month after the zombie outbreak began, and introduces the concept of supernatural variants such as resurrected mummies, intelligent zombies, and ghosts. The mission to find AIDS drugs for a Somalian warlord is an effective device for sending the protagonist on this dangerous quest, since it brings the themes of decay, danger and disease to the fore. The tone is bleak right from the start: on the first pages the protagonist reaches Manhattan Island and sees the lines of 'waving' people, but it is soon clear that they are not survivors. \u201cOsman,\u201d I shouted, \u201cOsman, we\u2019re getting too close,\u201d but the Captain just yelled for me to shut up again. On the walkway I saw hundreds of them, hundreds of people. They waved at us, their arms moving stiffly like something from a silent movie. They pushed toward the railing, pushed to get closer to us. As the trawler rolled closer I could see them crawling over one another in their desperation to touch us, to swarm onboard. I thought maybe, just maybe they were alright, maybe they\u2019d run to Liberty Island for refuge and been safe there and were just waiting for us, waiting for rescue but then I smelled them and I knew. I knew they weren\u2019t alright at all. Give me your tired, your poor, your wretched refuse, my brain repeated over and over, a mantra. I was butchering Emma Lazarus but I couldn\u2019t stop, my brain wouldn\u2019t stop. Give me your huddled masses. Huddled masses yearning to breathe. \u201cOsman! Turn away!\u201d One of them toppled over the side of the railing, maybe pushed by the straining crowd behind. A woman in a bright red windbreaker, her hair a matted lump on one side of her head. She tried desperately to dog-paddle toward the trawler but she was hindered by the fact that she kept reaching up, reaching up one bluish hand to try to grab at us.

One amongst them is different; though he shares their appetites he has retained his human intelligence. Alone among the mindless zombies, Gary Fleck is an eyewitness to the end of the world \u2014 and perhaps the evil genius behind it all.From the other side of the planet, a small but heavily-armed group of schoolgirls-turned-soldiers has come in search of desperately needed medicine.Dekalb, a former United Nations weapons inspector, leads them as their local guide. Ayaan, a crack shot at the age of sixteen, will stop at nothing to complete her mission. They think they are prepared for anything.On Monster Island they will find that there is something worse even than undeath.My thoughts:Dekalb was a UN Weapons Inspector in Africa when the Epidemic hit. He and his daughter have made their way to Somalia seeking refuge - and the sitting warlord, Mama Halima has said she will grant them refuge. On one condition - Dekalb must help her soldiers, the Free Women's Republic find medicines.Dekalb agrees and the search is on - leading them from town to town, city to city, until finally they arrive in New York. Dekalb is certain that the medicines they need will be at the UN.What he didn't take into account is the shear number of people who lived in New York - those people are now zombie's and they are hungry.When Dekalb's small group of teenage soldiers meet up with a couple hundred survivors - a plan for evacuation is hatched. But now, the zombie's have a leader - and he has retained his ability to reason - and does not want his food source leaving New York.I really enjoyed Monster Island. :)Mr. Wellington has added his own twist to the zombie lore and it is very unique - made me think about it for a bit. :)I give Monster Island 5 out of 5 stars and I can't wait to read the remaining two installments in this trilogy.M"}, {"userName": "Matteo Pellegrini", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21134167-matteo-pellegrini", "userReview": "Dopo una spaventosa epidemia, l'intero mondo industrializzato \u00e8 caduto nelle mani degli zombie.

It's not that David Wellington is a bad writer, b/c he's certainly not. But the book needed much more polish. There were sentences that were unclear, that needed to be reworded for clarity and flow throughout. I didn't mind the style, kind of a Hemingway shortness to it, which works in a quick, in-your-face story like this. But, the characters needed better motives to do the things they were doing. In a zombie apocalypse, my first concern, as a parent, would not be the education my daughter is getting, but her survival and staying with her at all cost. I think the author was trying to set it up as if he had no choice, but I feel like he really didn't fight it very hard. Also, this character, Dekalb, he was such a scaredy-cat, for lack of a better description. He's been a weapon's dealer in Africa, and has been surviving zombies, and he just turns tail and runs at the first sign of attack and is afraid to discharge his gun? Come on. The other main protagonist, Gary, I have almost no motivation for him doing what he's done in the intro and by page 55, which is where I stopped reading, I don't even care what happens to either of them b/c I have no reason to. They are poorly drawn and shallow. These characters needed much more fleshing out. There were easily fixable inconsistencies. As an example, around the spot I stopped reading the group of mercenaries and Dekalb go up a stairwell and down another hall, and down another. They hear zombies coming up the stairs (and I'm told these zombies are slow) and a fully-trained mercenary is grabbed by one that comes out of the stairwell. Please. You are not near the stairwell for starters, and if she was standing next to the door you would have heard it opening. Stuff like that. Anyhow, the setting and ideas all had potential, but needed to go through more editing and fleshing out. Wish I had liked it better. Disappointed."}, {"userName": "Andrea Blythe", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1270905-andrea-blythe", "userReview": "In a zombie infested world, only third world countries, those who have suffered constant military insurgencies, have been able to sustain themselves, the heavily armed population able to hold the undead back. Somalia is one of these countries, but the warlord in charge has aids and medicines are in short supply. Dekalb, a UN official and his daughter have been promised safety within Somolia if he can bring the warlord the medicine she needs.In desperation, he leads a troop of school girl soldiers to the UN building in New York, where he is sure the medicine can still be found. But the tiny island of Manhattan is swarming with the undead and something else, something even more dangerous, waits as well.Despite my huge love for zombies, this one didn't catch me or draw me in like I had hoped. The concept of the militarized school girls is rather cool, but because this is written from Dekalb's point of view, the girls themselves become little more than backdrop. Dekalb is a complex enough character (though kind of a weakling and not all that interesting to me), but the girls are indoctrinated cardboard cutouts without much personality themselves. Something I find to be highly disappointing.And while the writing is good, I'm not all that thrilled with the \"twist\", nor with the direction the plot ultimately took. There was nothing wrong with it, per se, but the concept just didn't appeal to me. The result was that I occasionally found myself bored with the novel and switching to other books on my tbr list."}, {"userName": "Mike Rogers", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7415168-mike-rogers", "userReview": "David Wellington's \"Monster Island\" began as a serialized blog about zombies which has now been published in book form. I hadn't heard of the blog before I started reading the book, and really only picked up the book because my dad has a weird sort of fascination with zombies (and does a very convincing zombie walk).Monster Island starts after an epidemic has wiped out most of the human population of Earth and turned them into zombies. Mr. Dekalb is a United Nations weapons inspector who has survived the epidemic and must travel to New York from Africa to procure AIDS medicine for a Somali warlord who is keeping his daughter captive. This somewhat flimsy aspect of the plot is what gives Dekalb his motivation to travel to New York with a cadre of well armed, Somali girl soldiers and begin slaughtering the undead in his quest to obtain the drugs from UN headquarters.Dekalb's main obstacle is Gary, a former doctor who has managed to turn himself into a zombie yet maintain his intelligence. Gary is eventually able to get the millions of NYC zombies to do whatever he wants and thus the stage is set for the big climactic battle between him and Dekalb's band of survivors.The book is an amusing read that isn't bad enough to put down but isn't exactly a page turner either. If you're into zombies it's worth checking out.

Gary is a great bad guy and his back story is one of the coolest parts of this story. Gary really gives this story a great twist and sets up the series to be quite exciting.There are a few great kill scenes as their should be in all great zombie novels.

From the beginning, you realize that Gary is a talking zombie. Not just talking/mumbling; but functioning brain; ability to think and process information. Of course, he deteriorates without sustenance...ahem. Anyway, the story is about survivors trying to survive, and some hints of Guillermo Del Toros 'The Strain' ring a little throughout the story. The concept of a zombie speaking made the story interesting, a little out there; but not ridiculous. The mummies are a little ridiculous, but I will let you read that!If you are looking for a little quick zombie action with a differing storyline than the norm; this book is for you. Mind you, it is not a life changer, just a little fun on the weekend.

An intelligent super-zombie tries to eat him.Much of the time it seemed as if the author did a lot of research, but the internal logic broke down unexpectedly from time to time. Why would a sniper target a bad guy's trigger finger? Can you really drag a man down a street by his intestines? In a book that appears to be going for (relatively)hard science, why give the antagonist zombie-telepathy? It doesn't appear to be an intentional juxtaposition; it feels amateurish.Overall a perfectly readable zombie story, but after the awesomeness of World War Z and Day by Day Armageddon, I was a little disappointed."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7957821-michelle", "userReview": "I was looking forward to this.
