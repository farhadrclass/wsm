I have worked with the Whooping Crane reintroduction program here in Calgary, exercising young crane chicks, and I simply couldn\u2019t resist the pretty cover with the Whooping Crane on it. Plus that alluring title (for a birder), Birds of America. How either the image or the title relate to the stories within remains a mystery to me.Moore\u2019s stories are rather bleak views of human relationships\u2014told from all kinds of angles but with similar disappointments to go round. As in this dinner party exchange: \"The thing to remember about love affairs,\" says Simone, \"is that they are all like having raccoons in your chimney.\"\"Oh, not the raccoon story,\" groans Cal.\"Yes!

The stories here are not big or grand or epic, but work simply as little one-act plays, exposing the inherent complexities and dramas in the everyday lives we all lead. Moore's writing style is subtle, and laced with a fantastic sense of wit; witness, for example, her slight mocking of the health fad craze in the names she creates for juice bars; or her sly commentary about the misnomer of \"busy bee\" in the story \"Whatever You Want, Fine.\" Added to this wit is a keen sense of what it means to be on this earth and to interact with someone else (I'm being cliche here, because I'm no Lorrie Moore), to have an effect upon someone's life simply because you happen to walk a similar road together for awhile, and it is the way in which she explores this truth that gives her stories the weight they need to avoid being simple comic pieces. The three best stories, in my opinion, are \"Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens,\" \"People Like That Are The Only People Here,\" and \"Which is More Than I Can Say About Some People.\" The first story deals with a woman who has a wonderfully loving husband and a great daughter, but can't get over the loss of her cat, and so decides to undergo therapy that guarentees to \"cure her by Christmas or the last session is free!\" The second deals with pediatric oncology in a harrowing and moving way, about the distance illness brings between people, and the last deals with a mother and daughter, on a road trip through Ireland, and the ways in which revelations of character don't end simply because you know someone for years and years. These are wonderful, wonderful stories, the kind that make you think about your own life, examine it in the ways the characters are examined here, that affirm realizations you yourself have come to or guide you toward ones you haven't, and I don't think you can ask for much more than that from a book."}, {"userName": "Sara Batkie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/334035-sara-batkie", "userReview": "Maybe the most perfect short story collection I've read (that wasn't a \"collected works\" or \"best of\"). I understand the criticisms of \"same-y\" characters and too-witty dialogue, but frankly I don't care. Lorrie Moore can wrap me around her little finger any time. Kakutani's back blurb calls the book: \"sad, funny, lyrical, and prickly\" and that's probably the best way to describe her. She is awash in those kinds of contradictions, but it's what makes her stories a joy to read. You always end up where you least expected to go but somehow in her absurd little world, it makes sense. There were times I laughed aloud: \"He doesn't believe in shouting 'Fire' in a crowded movie theater, but he does believe in shouting 'Fie!' and has done it twice himself - both times at Forrest Gump\" (132) and there were times I wept, and there were times her prose got something so right that I just sat there dumbfounded: \"She knew she was saying good-bye to something important, which was not that bad, in a way, because it meant that at least you had said hello to it to begin with\" (80). I'm sure I'll start imitating her now. Sigh.I have a habit of highlighting my favorite stories in the contents as I go along. They were: \"Which is More Than I Can Say About Some People\", \"Dance in America\", \"Charades\", \"What You Want to Do Fine\", \"People Like That Are the Only People Here\" (probably the very best, if you only read one, read this), and \"Terrific Mother\". All the stories are well done and worth reading, though.And psst, Ms. Moore, it's been almost ten years since this book came out. I demand more!

In the end I was left with the impression that it's almost impossible for two people to have a fulfilling relationship and almost everyone is unhappy in one way or another. Though this may very well be true it's still dispiriting to read about.In some of these stories characters hook up with the wrong people because they're lonely and needy - and then are disappointed. In other stories characters have dishonest and/or unfaithful partners and have a hard time dealing with it (throw the bum out would be my view - but this may be easier said than done). One story is about parents coping with a baby who's stricken with cancer. Another is about a woman who was holding a friend's baby when an accident occurs, killing the child; of course the woman blames herself and can hardly go on.I think my favorite story is about an unhappy spouse who learns to use a gun, then gets to shoot a nutcase who breaks into people's homes to make them sing. For me this was the most satisfying tale.It's a good book but you'll probably need something light and fun after reading it.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/419287-jessica", "userReview": "One of my main strategies for dealing with life is, \"If I don't laugh, I'll cry.\"I think Lorrie Moore's strategy is to make me do both."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/98569-liz", "userReview": "I really liked Lorrie Moore's \"How To Be an Other Woman\" (from the love stories collection I read) but I was not wowed by this book.

First up is \nBirds of America\n, a collection of 12 short stories from Lorrie Moore. It's a favorite book of my new pal Snotchocheez, a kind, wise, supportive, all-around cool guy.Now, in 1998, when \nBOA\n was released, I was 20. I was a junior in college at Mizzou. I was fed up for life with the academic approach to analyzing literature. Call me simple (and do it slowly, with exaggerated head nods, to increase my chances of understanding you), but I like to read for enjoyment. My holy trinity is plot, character and voice, and that's all I need. I don't care about symbolism, and I don't want to spend an hour dissecting the deep meaning of a single descriptive paragraph. \nBOA\n was a double whammy - a lofty, cerebral book designed to be cherished and studied by intellectuals that is itself densely populated with professors, writers and miscellaneous academic nimrods. It views them with the correct amount of detached irony while still being of the same mind, which to me was a blessing and a curse. I'm glad I read \nBOA\n, and on any given page there were phrases and observations to love, with abundant sparkling wit applied toward a broad spectrum of human experiences. But this book was never a close friend or a page-turner. Its place was more in the lecture hall of my soul than the dorm room or even the dining hall. (I love the dining hall.)This is a collection of twelve short stories, all but one of them previously published in the \nNew Yorker, Harper's, The Paris Review\n, et al. The protagonists of most of these stories are restless, unsatisfied women in their thirties who distract themselves with devoted lesser men. Collectively, most of these characters are interchangeable. Which made me think, when you have a bunch of same-ish stories that feature same-ish protagonists, why not composite them into a single novel? But then I thought, Well, because it's easier to just write a story here, a story there, get two bucks a word to publish them in a lit mag, then re-edit and compile them into a single book, get a fat check from Random House, do a nice little public-appearance tour to support it, then go back to your day job as tenured professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where you can assign your own book to your students as required reading and then spend a semester's worth of classes talking about how good it is using nothing but Big Words. Geez, I'm cynical.\nBOA\n gains momentum as it goes, though. The first real break from the same-ish protagonist formula is like four stories from the end, with a vacationing gay couple where one is blind and the other is actually straight, or thought he was. You'll see seriously sick little kids (like, nearing death) pop up here and there, culminating in \"People Like That Are the Only People Here,\" the most heart-wrenching story in the book. That story tunnels further into the human psyche than I could even attempt, and has some bitter belly laughs to boot.The last story, \"Wonderful Mother,\" begins with its protagonist being handed a baby at a family-and-friends function, losing her balance and fatally dropping the baby on its head. So let me point out - this is the kind of premise the short-story format is perfect for. Do I want to be stuck with an accidental baby-killer protagonist for 350 pages? Nope. Will I spend 40 pages full-on engaged while she marries some professor just because he insists on it, then takes her to this nightmarish European academic retreat? You bet I will.By the way, I'm 37, I have a bachelor's degree, I'm a server in a fine-dining restaurant, I read a lot of young-adult fiction and celebrity memoirs, and my chances of going to grad school are still hovering steady at about 18%."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2499261-rachel", "userReview": "I loved three of the stories in this collection: \"Charades,\" about familial aggressions played out over a holiday game, \"What You Want to Do Fine,\" about the breakdown of a romance between two men on endless road trip vacations across the US, and \"Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens,\" about a married mother mourning her dead cat - which, despite sounding like it would mostly be sad, is also so deadpan funny that I laughed until I cried at one point. I would say that I enjoyed reading about nine out of twelve stories, which is pretty good for a bigger story collection. My feeling about Birds of America reflects my feeling about Lorrie Moore's work in general. Mostly, it strikes me as funny and spot-on in terms of human oddness and and vulnerabilities, but sometimes her writing crosses over into too much quirk (contrivance?) to be relatable.Note: I have not read this two times, I have read it once.

Rob Roberge referred to her stories at Antioch with fondness, and I was required to read \"Anagrams\" one project period, but I didn't fall in love with her like I did with her collection of short stories: \"Birds of America.\" In \"What You Want to Do Fine,\" she tackles a difficult love between men, war, the draft, lost children, AIDS, blindness and the parade of bones in cemetery visits. She personalizes the hopeless boredom and gentleness of real intimacy between two people and the question that echoes is what is it to love and know someone? In \"Real Estate\" she smashed the narrative structure with her 2.5 pages of \"Ha!\" as a response to her husbands multiple affairs that happen in Spring. She shows where rage goes when it folds one's insides like origami. She does this with her witty genius and tricky twists of fate with other characters who act out a similar rage. But, the story that left the deepest imprint was \"People Like That Are the Only People Here\" which did loops around illness and the type of loss that happens, how it shreds relationships thread by thread and how when it's over, it's hollow survivors never want to see those people again, that sadness again.

The twelve stories that comprise 'Birds of America' are hilariously funny, painfully sad, and deeply human. \"Oh, the rich torment that was life,\" she writes in \"Real Estate.\" Perhaps what I love most about her stories are the characters that bring them to life: they are real people, full of fears and flaws and imperfections. They reveal the complexities that make us all human: our longing to find meaning in our lives; our desire for human connection; and the sad but encouraging universality of our losses. In Moore's stories, we meet the vulnerable and the lonely and the grief-stricken and the ambitious. In \"Willing,\" we meet \"a man held hostage by the anxious cast of his dream\" and a woman who \"was unequal to anyone's wistfulness. She had made too little of her life. Its loneliness shamed her like a crime.\" In \"Community Life,\" we meet the mysterious Olena, who \"wished to start over again, to be someone living coltishly in the world, not someone hidden away, behind books, with a carefully learned voice and a sad past.\" In \"Beautiful Grade,\" we meet Bill, whose \"own sadness ... slosh about in his life in a low-key way, formless and self-consuming.\" In \"What You Want To Do Fine,\" we are introduced to Quilty, whose blindness never stops him from wanting to see the world around him.These stories are rich with both humor and sadness, no doubt the sign of remarkable writing. Moore has a unique ability to capture with words the depths of human suffering and the breadth of human emotions in a way I've never quite seen before. More than anything, she reminds us that a full life is full of beauty and suffering, of darkness and joy. In \"Real Estate,\" Moore writes, \"She never knew anymore what was good life and what was bad, what was desirable matter and what was antimatter, what was the thing itself and what was the death of the thing: one mimicked the other, and she resented the work of having to distinguish.\" In the book's final story, \"Terrific Mother,\" Moore highlights the complexity and ambiguity of life: \"...In this temporary dissolve, seeing death and birth, seeing the beginning and then the end, how they were the same quiet black, same nothing ever after: everyone's life appeared in the world like a dark movie in a room. First dark, then light, then dark again. But it was all staggered, so that somewhere there was always light.\" I'll end with my favorite passage from this book, which comes from \"Which Is More Than I Can Say About Some People\": \"Abby began to think that all the beauty and ugliness and turbulence one found scattered through nature, one could also find in people themselves, all collected there, all together in a single place. No matter what terror or loveliness the earth could produce -- winds, seas -- a person could produce the same, lived with the same, lived with all that mixed-up nature swirling inside, every bit. There was nothing as complex in the world -- no flower or stone -- as a single hello from a human being.\" Five stars for this beautiful and unforgettable collection."}, {"userName": "Billy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/390579-billy", "userReview": "First of all, with Lorrie Moore: Oh, the puns!Second of all, she doesn't really do men. There's one story in here that takes a male character's perspective, and it's one of the weakest. It's a good faith effort, but the shortcoming seems to stem from a genuine befuddlement as to how men might dwell in themselves, how they might carry themselves from one moment to the next. That's not to say she is limited as writing from a specifically gendered perspective, or that she reads like a feminine \"type\"; I don't see her able to write with sympathy from the point of view of plenty of women characters. But her signature narrative voice is so personal (and clear, the way you always know which one is the \"Woody Allen character\" in his movies, no matter who's playing it), built on earned experience and observation, that it isn't as compelling when she briefly inhabits a different perspective, like a tourist climbing up a bell tower to take in the vista for ten minutes before turning back, with a way of seeing that is keenly sensitive but still superficial, transient.  Now that that's off my chest, let me thirdly say that this collection has put Lorrie Moore in the top two or three of my favorite authors. When describing literature you like, it's easy to reach for superlatives (\"the most insightful prose and thoughtful character exploration\"; \"never been a more sensitive accounting of the rhythms of emotion\") in an attempt to sell your friends on it in the hope that they will read the same thing and feel how you feel when you were in the midst of it so that your sense of elevation, of light, of indigestion will be confirmed in another person, meaning that you were not after all drifting alone when you were moved, and that what you felt was real, at least in the feeling of it. But her writing, at its best, seems indifferent to where it ranks on the scales of vividness, or poignancy, or wit. She's not looking for the truth - is there any more superlative concept? She's not trying to wow you with her language (her inability to resist said puns being key evidence of that). Although she is mightily skilled in descriptive imagery, inspiration and judgment on opposite ends of the seesaw (and the former a bit heavier), the craftsmanship is not displayed for its own gaudy sake, but is the fruit of careful looking at what it means to be human. She's interested in the experience of the personal which - somehow, unexpectedly, in our never-more-self-obsessed time, is missed, either because it has fallen into another dimension, or perhaps because it doesn't exist at all. As one of her characters mouths back at \"the Lorrie Moore character\" at one point, \"this is the kind of thing that fiction is: it's the unlivable life, the strange room tacked onto the house, the extra moon that is circling the earth unbeknownst to science.\" Perhaps it's enough to leave it at this: Lorrie Moore makes me want to read more and makes me daydream about writing myself someday, or never; either way, as long as I think about it. Lastly, there's the crush. There's an episode of Entourage in which a woman meets and goes to bed with Vinnie Chase and, the next morning, explains to him, after his surprise at learning that she is engaged and imminently to be married, that she and her fianc\u00e9 have an understanding that, given the opportunity, they are allowed to sleep with specific celebrities on a pre-defined and pre-disclosed list; Vince is on the list. Were C and I to have a similar arrangement, I would be tempted to include Ms. Moore. And maybe not really for the soggy awkwardness of a surely underwhelming (from her perspective) physical encounter, but at least for the chance to buy her a drink, tell a few jokes, maybe offer her a shot of wry - and be flirted back at for a half hour or so. I saw a comment on a youtube clip of a talk she was giving that she \"makes disdain beautiful.\" Maybe it's just the rarified glamour of being a commercially successful art fiction writer who's also fetching, but I have to agree - wise, mordant, so wonderfully Irish. Sigh."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82840-laura", "userReview": "I finally gave up reading this book yesterday after getting about 2/3 of the way through it. It is always so hard for me to give up a book -- my ego gets entangled in the idea that I MUST finish reading it... but I realized that I was wasting time with this book that was depressing me instead of filling my life with books that engage and inspire me. Moore's writing is sometimes right on in her descriptions of people. For example, in one story, the sentence \"She freezes hams\" perfectly encapsulates the stock figure of a generic and somewhat dull sister-in-law. But that's just the problem. Too many of these characters are stock characters that I feel like I've seen before in other short stories about people in their middle lives who are unfulfilled for one reason or another. It seemed to me like many of these stories were about characters either finally feeling the depth of their lack of fulfillment or grief or fear or finding some small glimpse of hope in the middle of the lack of fulfillment. There were many passages that I liked, because they were sharp and originally turned with clever collocations of words. But then I got tired of that. Reading this book made me long for a good, winding Victorian novel where the goal is not to invent some fantastically clever new arrangement of words to make the reader go \"Wow!\" but to craft a good story with characters that we fall in love with and feel what they feel. I feel like this kind of writing gets a lot of praise in MFA circles and cutting edge literary circles. But this kind of writing feels like wallowing. I like books where characters grow and change, and I feel like I've learned something about life or about another way of living somewhere else in the world or about human nature. I didn't learn anything from this book except that humans are capable of doing a great deal of wallowing and of creating a lot of their own misery. Right now, I'm adding this book to the stack that I plan to sell to my local used book store, and I'm hoping that I get some money for it that I can use to buy books that I can really dive into."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1313994-jeff", "userReview": "The trouble I have with most short story books is that I tend to forget what the first story was about by the time I get to the last one. In lieu of this trend wherein I do not think I inhabit my oubliette alone, most short story writers attempt to create vignettes (heavy on the French today) that are tiredly unique to each other. Moore, I think, attempts solidarity by thematically and tonally creating stories that are strikingly similar. Dare I say that each narrator has the same Mooreish wit an analyst could presume is a solid embodiment of Moore's own cynical wit and perspective?Thematically, there are golden threads that link the concepts of place or where one is from, relationships and tired fidelity, child death (heavy on the gut-Wrench today), academia's ivory toilet, and American Diaspora who live at home. America is so large, and filled with so many identities, that to be an American means to sometimes be disjointed from one's own identity. It's the willing to please but not knowing one's own pleasure ideology that pervades Americana, and Moore gets it. She gets it she gets it she gets it, by God.She's brilliant and pretty; her prose that sort of beautiful that doesn't hide its shy brilliance. It's like that blond in high school us bookish kids wished was a little smarter, to justify our lust.But really, it was just the hormones.You may not remember which story was what, but the book that is realized in their telling is one for the shelf, not a damn Kindle (tm)."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Sun", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118030-stephanie-sun", "userReview": "\u201cThere are the notes. Now where is the money?\u201d\nThe short story is no longer the commercial storytelling medium that it was in its heydey, but the copyright page of Birds of America is strong evidence that the short story system can still work incredibly well as an incubator of literary talent and new work. The publisher writes:Eleven of these stories were originally published in slightly different form in the following: Elle: \u2018Agnes of Iowa\u2019; Harper\u2019s: \u2018What You Want to Do Fine\u2019 (originally titled \u2018Lucky Ducks\u2019); The New York Times: \u2018Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens\u2019 (originally titled \u2018If Only Bert Were Here\u2019); The New Yorker: \u2018Beautiful Grade,\u2019 \u2018Charades,\u2019 \u2018Community Life,\u2019 \u2018Dance in America,\u2019 \u2018People Like That Are the Only People Here,\u2019 \u2018Which Is More Than I Can Say About Some People,\u2019 and \u2018Willing\u2019; The Paris Review: \u2018Terrific Mother\u2019Widely considered Moore\u2019s strongest book to date, Birds of America benefited from Moore\u2019s collaborations not just with her Knopf editor Victoria Wilson, but with an additional eight talented periodical editors, including George Plimpton and Bill Buford.(The one story in Birds of America not listed above, \u201cReal Estate,\u201d was published in The New Yorker in August 1998, as part of the book\u2019s public roll-out.)These collaborations seem to have brought a welcome discipline to Moore\u2019s work, deepening the end result. What was once \u201cmerely\u201d clever has become wise, and what was merely striking has become clear and true.Dave Eggers in his review in Salon summed up Moore\u2019s concerns best, somehow capturing both the darkness and tongue-in-cheek humor of her vision in a single bulleted list:\nMoore\u2019s stories are about these things:\u2022 Longing\u2022 Suffering\u2022 People mistakenly dropping babies on their head in such a way that the baby dies\u2022 Depression, or at least life\u2019s way of sort of stalling at middle age\u2022 Depression, or at least life\u2019s way of sort of stalling during that period just before middle age\u2022 Depression, or at least life\u2019s way of stalling at any age at all, really\u2022 Marriages and affairs that are hopeless but serviceable, like a scratchy, Army-issue blanket\u2022 Creature comforts in the face of unfaceable pathos\u2022 Lives that would warrant suicide if the owner could find the inspiration\u2022 Friends who make you laugh\u2022 Easy puns\u2022 At least one person per story with cancer\u2022 Perhaps a child with cancer, too\nThere are other writers who successfully tackle similar material, are funny, and are also better (or at least more consistently good) than Moore at other fundamentals like character development, social commentary, and plot. As part of the argument for reading Birds of America\u2014its contemporary setting\u2014fades with time, one is forced to consider the overall value of the offering here. Birds was a standout book of 1998, sure, but should this be included among the stories that students of the future use to access Clinton-era America in the way that students of today access the Gilded Age via Fitzgerald and Waugh?It doesn\u2019t take much time browsing through the book with this question in mind to surface ample evidence that the correct answer is a resounding \u2018Yes.\u2019Take the subtitle of what is perhaps Moore\u2019s most iconic work, the Bill Buford-edited \u201cPeople Like That Are the Only People Here\u201d: CANONICAL BABBLING IN PEED ONK.The urination- and pig-sound-looking \u201cPeed Onk\u201d is, we find out, what people embedded in the world of Pediatric Oncology call Pediatric Oncology because, presumably, they must say the words that mean \u201cthe treatment and study of tumors in children\u201d so often that they have shortened the phrase for convenience and also have become numb to it. Moore, by including it in its most juvenile and ridiculous incarnation in the subtitle and then revealing its horror halfway through her story, very effectively calls attention to the increased jargonization of everyday American language, and by extension the increased commodification and conformity of everyday American life.Peed Onk, like much of modern progress, is a double-eged sword, something that Moore explores explicitly in the coda to \u201cPeople Like That,\u201d whose tacked-on feeling is deceptive. Indeed, the coda, with its perplexingly anti-social message, is perhaps the point of the story. The character known as The Husband asks the character known as The Mother what she thinks about the other brave Peed Onk parents as they leave Peed Onk with child in remission in tow:\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t you feel consoled, knowing we\u2019re all in the same boat, that we\u2019re all in this together?\u2019\u201d\nSurprising The Husband and the reader, The Mother replies in the negative:\n\u201c\u2018Let\u2019s make our own way,\u2019 ... \u2018and not in this boat.\u2019\u201d\nConformity (even in the context of the courageous endurance to be found at cancer bedsides) equals death. That\u2019s as fierce of a rallying cry for the survival of iconoclasm, and iconoclasm as survival, as anything Frank Sinatra crooned.Lorrie Moore: American as a flipped bird. Who knew?-PREVIOUSLY:These stories shouldn't work. They are riddled with twitchy wordplay and characters without clear motivations, who seem to revel in their own mediocrity or other middleness (middle age, middle America).My favorite story in this collection is about a childless woman who accidentally kills her friend's baby, accepts her boyfriend's spontaneous marriage proposal in order to accompany him to an academic retreat in Italy, and then gets lots of massages. And it is somehow hilarious, brilliant, romantic, heartwarming, and a page-turning read.I can't promise that it's everyone's cup of tea, and I know it isn't, but I've found plenty of re-read value in this book, as well as wisdom about relationships and enduring crisis."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1856914-lauren", "userReview": "I don't get Loorie Moore. I read her novel A gate at the whatever...the first thing that I read by her. I'd heard it lauded as one of the greatest books of the year, which it was not. So I decided that I would try at one of her more famous books of short stories. I heard about how great it was, how it was a must read when it comes to the form. I hated it almost as much as the novel. Her characters are dispassionate, the stories about pretty much the same thing. It's a trying book to get through. The only exception is the story \"People like that are the only people here,\" which is in third person, but is closer to a first person narrative. There is actually feeling in the text (perhaps because it's basis stems from a personal experience that she had). But come on. She rants against academia and \"the circle jerk\" of academics and then has to put on a display of her intellectual capacity. In the abovementioned story she lists the names of the children in the cancer ward the last mentioned, Mort and Tod. I speak German and understand the French reference and I thougt well that was clever until she put in parenthesis (Mort and Tod!) Sigh. Why point out how clever you are. You made up the names. It's fiction. Look I named the characters after death in two different languages other than English. Why not a wink, itstead of a self-congratulations.She had some clever ideas...the robber who asks people to sing because he does not know one song. Although music pervades society, I still appreciate the absurdity of the character not knowing a song and then scribbling the lyrics down like mad while he is robbing people. In the same story, I also like the fact that the main character and her friend take up shooting practice, but use pieces that are relics of the past. But overall, I was bored. At least I wasn't angry like when I finished the novel."}, {"userName": "Saxon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/217922-saxon", "userReview": "Lorrie Moore has really only one story. It usually has something to do with a mild tragedy back-dropped by a modern life that is so cluttered and unexplainable that no one really can see or pinpoint what the fuss is all about. As she works through each story, the main character(usually a woman) is slightly neurotic, says (or thinks) colorless, off-handed things that seem entirely inappropriate considering the circumstances and yet, seem entirely true to life as well. And, of course, like life (and post-modernism) there really isn't ever resolution let alone a clear understanding of what was trying to be resolved. Admittedly, it doesn't sound all too fascinating and while she is formulaic in both plot and context, she pulls if off. Moore balances the tragically heartbreaking and the ironically comedic quite well and she does modern dialogue better than any writer out there (I really wish she would have written a screenplay at some point). You have definitely read stories like this before--they appear all the time in The New Yorker, The Atlantic or This American Life by east-coast educated writer with hipster cred--and while I tend to dislike and become extremely annoyed with such stories, Birds of America is, deservedly, one of a few exceptions.

No one is that naive, and wide eyed and simultaneously tired and sad all the time. Ever. You know? It felt like a gimmick. Because it was deployed in every story--because it is, in fact, Lorrie Moore's identifiable style, the narrators began to mimic each other.

Stories remarkable in their range, emotional force, and dark laughter, and in the sheer beauty and power of their language.From the opening story, \"Willing\", about a second-rate movie actress in her thirties who has moved back to Chicago, where she makes a seedy motel room her home and becomes involved with a mechanic who has not the least idea of who she is as a human being, Birds of America unfolds a startlingly brilliant series of portraits of the unhinged, the lost, the unsettled of our America. In the story \"Which Is More Than I Can Say About Some People\" (\"There is nothing as complex in the world--no flower or stone--as a single hello from a human being\"), a woman newly separated from her husband is on a long-planned trip through Ireland with her mother. When they set out on an expedition to kiss the Blarney Stone, the image of wisdom and success that her mother has always put forth slips away to reveal the panicky woman she really is. In \"Charades,\" a family game at Christmas is transformed into a hilarious and insightful (and fundamentally upsetting) revelation of crumbling family ties. In \"Community Life,\"a shy, almost reclusive, librarian, Transylvania-born and Vermont-bred, moves in with her boyfriend, the local anarchist in a small university town, and all hell breaks loose. And in \"Four Calling Birds, Three French Hens,\" a woman who goes through the stages of grief as she mourns the death of her cat (Anger, Denial, Bargaining, Haagen Dazs, Rage) is seen by her friends as really mourning other issues: the impending death of her parents, the son she never had, Bosnia.In what may be her most stunning book yet, Lorrie Moore explores the personal and the universal, the idiosyncratic and the mundane, with all the wit, brio, and verve that have made her one of the best storytellers of our time.", "title": "Birds of America", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19631.Birds_of_America", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388641896l/19631.jpg", "reviews": 1028, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11746.Lorrie_Moore", "name": "Lorrie Moore"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19631.Birds_of_America", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7076796-birds-of-america", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/849341.Birds_of_America", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9836859-p-jaros-de-am-rica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17976969-p-ssaros-da-am-rica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6076387-a-gate-at-the-stairs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/90872.Self_Help", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19634.Who_Will_Run_the_Frog_Hospital_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050057-bark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19632.Like_Life"]}
