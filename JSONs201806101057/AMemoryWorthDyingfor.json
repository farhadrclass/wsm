It surpassed them.The first thing I would mention due to the 4 stars not 5 is because I preferred the previous book's storyline.However, this author is brilliant at building suspense and keeping it moving throughout the novel. This is 400 pages and as I braced myself thinking the brilliant and intriguing start could not be maintained I was glad she proved me wrong as the suspense built up and the character's were so believable the book [unlike others I've read] actually got better and not worse as in some cases it can.The information was kept back and only fed through little by little to tease you into reading more and more because you need to know just why the main character is not allowed back in Texas and why would she risk going back?A fantastic book that lightly in some places, and direct in others mentions God and it is so refreshing to read a book like this that does not make you cringe. Will definitely read more from this author.

A lot!It\u2019s hard to get me to slow down long enough for something to capture and hold my attention, yet A Memory Worth Dying For did just that.I was gripped from the minute I started the Prologue and read all 397 pages in two sittings. It would have been just one if it had been humanly possible.I loved the intimacy of the characters. They were authentic, genuine, and relatable, but they weren\u2019t perfect. Thank goodness! I could \u2018see\u2019 them and felt like I got to know them. I also appreciated the wide array of emotions I felt from page to page - fear, sadness, joy, anxiety, excitement, suspense, etc. It was ALL there.God was there too. Sometimes in the background, and at the forefront in others, but his presence was palpable. Marti and Daniel experienced many earthly struggles, but also a host of spiritual ones too - struggles similar to those that many people deal with on a day to day basis. Woven throughout this murder mystery were heart wrenching examples of despair, but also heartfelt messages of love and hope. I would say this is a fiction novel with a very \u2018real-life\u2019 component. A Memory Worth Dying For has it all and I would highly recommend giving it a read!"}, {"userName": "Dana Kamstra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26200516-dana-kamstra", "userReview": "Characters: Daniel and Marti were fabulous characters to get to know. Both of them have a certain amount of unknowns in their lives. Daniel because of amnesia, and Marti because, well, she wasn\u2019t told why her marriage to Daniel was ending. Marti is quite likable as she goes against the odds of surviving numerous attacks by a stalker and someone who is desperate to keep the truth away from her. The secondary characters of the book were also quite interesting. Gerald (Daniel\u2019s father) with his attempts to make everything right and Veronica (Daniel\u2019s girlfriend) who is a bit, well, spoiled.Storyline: What an intriguing plot I found in this book! With the hero having lost his memories from a handful of years and a heroine who is unsure of what happened when her marriage disintegrated, this story is filled with mystery. Add to that a bunch of lies, and this is a book with a plot that keeps you guessing. I certainly didn\u2019t figure out everything until the final pages of this book.My Thoughts: I\u2019m certainly not ashamed to admit that I read this novel in a day. Within the first few chapters I was quite intrigued. Marti runs into her ex-husband and he acts like he doesn\u2019t know her. What a story idea! From there, threats against Marti increase and she can\u2019t really move on with her life until she gets to the bottom of it. The whole thing makes for a page-turner. Every time I set the book down I couldn\u2019t wait to pick this one back up again. If you enjoy a novel with a hefty dose of suspense, I highly recommend this one!**I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for my honest review.

A very pregnant Martha (Marti) Rushing is in a car with her sister-in-law and her sister-in-law's husband. He's driving and looses control. Martha survives but the others do not. Fast forward three years. Marti is living in Tennessee, divorced and an accomplished artist. Due to a concussion from the accident, she has no memory of it. All she remembers is what people said afterward, the horrible things her husband said to her, including that she must leave. She did leave and she's never been back to Texas. Marti's ex-husband Daniel has also had a memory loss. He had joined the army after the horrible experience with his wife. He'd suffered a memory loss as a result of an attack. He has no memory of his marriage with Marti nor his angry rejection of her. He only knows what others have told him. He does vaguely remember his childhood friend, Veronica, a woman who has now set her sights on him.The action ramps up when Marti receives a letter from Daniel's father. Daniel is dying and would she come visit him. She decides to go, despite her recent experiences with a stalker. Someone wants her to stay out of Texas. She puts her life in danger to see the man she still loves, the only one she thinks has the answers to what really happened years ago.It may seem a bit odd to have both spouses experience memory loss. It does make for a complicated plot but it pretty much works. There is lots of revealing of the past along the way but, in the end, it is reasonable.There is lots of suspense in the novel. Danger follows Marti to Texas and before too long the situation gets deadly. The characters are reasonably well crafted. My least favorite character, Veronica, was developed the best. Her false sweetness just made me cringe. She was so obvious in her conniving that I lost respect for Daniel. That he could not see what she was doing is reason to view him as a weak character. Martha is somewhere in between. Having two of the characters with memory loss hindered full character development for Daniel and Marti.The mystery aspect is pretty well done. In the end, everything made sense and Bruce did a good job of hiding some of the essential facts until near the end. This is a romance as well and we are kept waiting to see if Daniel and Marti will actually get together again.This novel has a strong Christian message. The gospel is clearly presented through character discussions. I recommend the novel to those who like a good romantic mystery.I received a complimentary digital copy of this book through Celebrate Lit for the purpose of an independent and honest review."}, {"userName": "Julie D.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15394532-julie-d", "userReview": "This was an unusual storyline. Marti is an artist who has been on the run from a stalker after her husband and his family turn their back on her because of something she has done. Unfortunately, she can't remember what happened because the accident was so bad, she hasobno memory of it. The family is going by something a well respected member of the community has told them. Marti believes that the stalker has something to do with her ex-husband because he was so angry and he still wants to punish her.Then she gets a letter from her former father-in-law telling her that Daniel, her ex husband, is dying and he wants to see her before he dies. Her love for him compels her to go despite being warned to not return to Texas.The story has a lot of twists and turns, however, I figured out exactly who did what and who was behind the threats to Marti quite quickly. Perhaps it's because I've read so many mysteries, but I do think the story line was a bit obvious. From that point of view, it was a disappointment because I figured things out so soon in the book. However, the author redeemed the story by making the ending quite frightening and it was \"edge of your seat\" reading for the last couple of chapters.It was a nice, easy read with likeable characters and tragic events. I did think that the ending regarding Chris, the child in the story, was a wee bit ridiculous. It's hard for me to believe he wouldn't have had a bad reaction to the changes that happened in his life. Despite these few things, I still enjoyed the book and stayed up late to finish it because I was invested in the characters, which is always a good sign of a good book. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.*This book was provided to me for my honest review by Ambassador International"}, {"userName": "Carrie Daws", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6612679-carrie-daws", "userReview": "It's not often I truly have trouble putting a book down. Yes, I find many books I enjoy, many books I look forward to picking up again. But a book so good I make a deal with my children that I'll cook them lunch if they can find their own breakfast--just so I can finish a book? Yeah, I did that with A Memory Worth Dying For.Anyone that knows me well knows I'm horrible at names! Truly horrible. And this book has a lot of characters to keep up with. Mrs. Bruce did a great job at introducing them slowly, yet I still had to write myself a quick cheat sheet on a few of them to help me keep them straight. That is the only thing that slowed me down with this book, though.The story is full of action and suspense as Marti presses ahead to do what she believes is the right thing. The author dropped enough hints that I thought I knew some of the answers to my questions, but kept enough back that I wasn't positive. And she did a great job at concealing the main bad guys and the reasons for their choices until later in the book.The storyline flowed well, with each new complication being reasonable and believable. The cast of characters were varied, from pompous to delightful, and I loved the insight into the world of horses and artists. But perhaps the thing my heart most desired was the emotional healing the main characters so desperately needed and received by the end of the book.The Bottom Line - 5 starsIf you liked Joanie Bruce's first novel (Alana Candler, Marked for Murder) or like a good suspense story, I highly recommend A Memory Worth Dying For. While it does take place after Mrs. Bruce's first book and Alana does make appearances in the second book, neither book is dependent on the other and you can easily read them out of sequence."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14073813-michelle", "userReview": "A Memory Worth Dying For by Joanie Bruce  Marti Rushing has lost so much.

This story tells an amazing tale of hurt and loss experienced by a woman trying to rebuild her life. The confusion and pain turns to fear and suspense as she is being hunted for reasons she doesn't understand. I love the way the story encourages the main character, along with us as readers, to stop running from the past and to face it to see what God might reveal through it.Again, Joanie does a great job developing her characters and story. You find yourself stepping right into the pages as you are gripped with suspense at the unfolding story. Her use of imagery is beautiful and I loved the landscapes she painted so vividly with her words.Redemption and forgiveness become vastly important in this tale and I love the way Joanie weaves the truth of this throughout her story.

Its terribly suspenseful, really!And another thing that certainly makes it realistic fiction is the hashtags. Seriously. We're talking almost 10 before page 50, and its kinda amazing; I know that I could never pull off, as a writer, such informal language, even if I was fluent in the lingo.But anyway. These characters are so individual and real, with each struggle that they experience. We see, for example the main character trying to soothe her emotions in strife repeating the words \"I'm fine. Everything is fine\" (31) and other times that shes told, humorously \u201cYou know what they say, young lady. You talk to yourself when you want intelligent conversation.\u201d (128) just because that is exactly how she is.I'm sure that some of you are waiting for me to mention a religious aspect to the novel, and its there, alright, not even being based off of the the trip to Chick-fil-a :) At one point (too many spoilers?) Marti argues \"\u201cOkay. Let me tell you another reason we can know the Bible is God\u2019s Word. It was written by more than forty writers who were from different backgrounds\u2014anywhere from fishermen to politicians. They wrote the Bible in three different languages, and they all came from three different continents\u2014yet the Bible sounds like it could have been written by the same man. None of their writings contradict each other, yet they were written over a span of fifteen hundred years.

It piqued my interest and left me wondering what exactly was going on in the story. The first few chapters still left me wondering what was going on in the story. I was completely befuddled and simply scratching my head wondering what happened three years ago? You are given a prologue that takes place those three years ago during the accident that ruined Marti\u2019s life; however, the facts you are given in the prologue completely contradict the facts that are given later on in the story. Someone must have twisted the evidence but who? And who is Marti\u2019s stalker who is determined that she not return to Texas and will even go so far as to attempt to kill her if she does?Marti is the sweetest person ever, if a little fragile after her husband broke her heart and threw her out of the house because of the accident that happened three years previous. Marti does not understand why Daniel threw her out and yelled all those unkind things to her, because she was suffering short term amnesia from the accident (that\u2019s right folks, Marti is not the one who holds the answers we oh, so desperately want.)Moving on to our next suspect- uh I mean character... Daniel is Marti\u2019s ex-husband, but he doesn\u2019t even remember being married to her. After their divorce he enlisted in the army and was blown up by a bomb. He now has amnesia as well, and does not remember anything that happened after his college graduation (seriously who\u2019s the person who has all the answers then?). Gerald, Daniel\u2019s father, certainly doesn\u2019t. He only knows what he\u2019s been told. However, Gerald is repentant of the way that he treated Marti when he encouraged Daniel to throw her out. Now he has come up with a harebrained plan to bring Marti back to Texas (even though her stalker really doesn\u2019t want her going there) in the hopes that her presence will help bring back Daniel\u2019s memories before he marries his childhood friend Veronica who he obviously doesn\u2019t love. Now if only Gerald could find a way to trick Marti into returning to Texas before it is too late\u2026This book was a highly emotional fast paced story that will have you turning the pages just to figure out all that is going on, and- even when you realize what is going on- to see how all the characters are going to get out of this alive\u2026My thanks go to Celebrate Lit and the author for providing me with a copy for an honest review.

Why oh why have I not discovered her sooner?? Joanie Bruce has the ability to make my pulse race and my heart throb! Her talent to create a book full of action, suspense and long lasting meaning, is outstanding. I was on the edge of my seat and almost had to have this book pried from hands, in order to get meals and attend to daily activities. I could NOT get this mystery out of my mind! The entire book took me less than two days to read, as I just could not stay focused on anything else, until I read the conclusion.The characters are extremely well developed in a realistic way that immediately gets the reader involved in their lives. I lived for a short time in their lives, feeling their fears, hurts, challenges. In order for me to love a book, I must be able to identify with at least one of the characters. I was able to do this with no problems!! I perhaps became a bit too involved as I wanted to reach out and give Marti a big hug and tell her that her life just had to get better. Not only were the main characters well described, but also the secondary ones. This is an unusual feature in a book.The plot was simply intriguing! Losing one's memory, the heroine confused as to how her marriage disintegrated, numerous lies, all make the mystery and suspense darker and deeper. There are twists and turns that keep one guessing as the story progresses. If you love books that are fast paced and full of drama, this is one that you shouldn't miss. A Christian theme runs throughout the plotline. There is a clear message that we should be faithful and depend on God , regardless of our circumstances. Even when the world seems full of evil and dark and dreary, there is hope. Joanie Bruce is to be commended on her fine Christian writing. Definitely a five star book!!

But when she gets the call that her ex-husband is dying, she has to go see him once more, no matter the danger. Daniel and Martha had such a wonderful marriage, but when an accident happened that was Martha\u2019s fault, their world, as well as their marriage was torn appart, and their lives were changed forever.This is my first book by author Joanie Bruce, and I didn\u2019t realize what an awesome read I was in for! I love Daniel and Marti\u2019s story. And I really liked that Ms. Bruce uses the verse, Joel 2:25a. \u201cAnd I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u201d in this story because it is so fitting for Marti and what she goes through.Daniel and Marti were loveable characters that I fell in love with immediately. Marti did such as awesome job of being around Daniel, even though he couldn\u2019t remember who she was. That would have to be a difficult situation to be around the love of your life, and they don\u2019t remember you. And to make matters worse, the nasty little villain that was so sure Daniel was going to marry her kept popping into the picture. Joanie Bruce gives readers an amazing story of love, grace, forgiveness, redemption and second chances in this heartwarming suspense thriller. I want to say so many thing about this book, but I don\u2019t want to give it away and ruin the read for anyone.

Poor Marti, she is in a very mess. Next thing we know, she has to face her ex-husband, Daniel. It's been three years, and she is in Tennessee now. His very presence causes her panic attacks. However, something is way off. Daniel doesn't seem to remember his wife of four years. It's instantly clear she is nowhere near over him. Why can't he remember her? Thus begins the threats that Marti can't go back to Texas, or she will die. So what does she do? Go back to Texas! I could have screamed.

I can't tell you what happened with out spoilers, but Marti has some kind of determination, death wish, stubborn streak, or her hair color isn't her natural color. WOW, this girl is something else.

I was drawn into the suspense of both of these books right from the start. The characters are believable and the author's style of writing lets you see the action happening as you are reading the words. \"A Memory Worth Dying For\" by Joanie Bruce is about not to always assume the worst about someone but to check out the facts. Daniel and his father didn't and it caused a lot of unnecessary grief and pain. Marti is on the run for her life because a stalker is after her and she has no idea why. She is warned to stay away from Texas but how can she stay away when the one she loves is dying, or is he really? Who is the stalker and is he the one trying to kill her? \"A Memory Worth Dying For\" by Joanie Bruce is a suspense novel but it is also a love story about a man and his wife and God's love for His people.

To my surprise and delight, Joanie also included a copy of her first novel, \u201cAlana Candler, Marked for Murder\u201d. I read and enjoyed both books and hope to find time to review the other one in the near future.\u201cA Memory Worth Dying For\u201d has an unusual plot with both primary characters suffering from some degree of amnesia. Marti Rushing cannot remember anything concerning the events surrounding a tragic auto crash that killed her sister-in-law, her husband and Marti\u2019s unborn baby. Angry because he believed a drunken Marti was responsible for the accident, her husband divorced her. During the three years following the crash Marti has moved from place to place because of a stalker and threatening communications but when she receives a letter begging her to return to Texas, she feels she has no choice but to do so.Although some of what happens in this book is a bit of a stretch, I personally enjoy having my imagination challenged. The plot built upon itself as one dangerous incident after another menaced Marti and more than one possible perpetrator looked suspicious. Multiple plot twists and major surprises popped up along the way but were all resolved satisfactorily by the conclusion.\u201cA Memory Worth Dying For\u201d is an enjoyable read with a theme of forgiveness and restored faith.

Multiple plot lines and short chapters kept the pace breathless, causing me to read late into the night as I tried to figure out who was out to get Marti. Marti and Daniel both struggle with their relationship with God, but for different reasons. Through the use of realistic dialogue, their friends and acquaintances lead them to prayerfully consider how to respond to God\u2019s desire to have a place in their lives. Told through the eyes of several characters, including the unknown villains, A Memory Worth Dying For has a high level of suspense and plenty of twists and turns. Themes of forgiveness and hope in God are woven throughout the story without being preachy. It is my hope Ms. Bruce plans additional novels in this series.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Petra Creasy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49766193-petra-creasy", "userReview": "Marti lives a life trying to forget the man she married.

The details in the narrative made me feel like I was a part of the story. The characters were so well written. It was a pleasure to get to know Marty. I was scared for her well being, and I hurt along with her as I read about the heartbreak she had been through. The mystery was intricate, the suspense was palpable, and the romance was sweet.

However, it can be a stand alone book as well. Once again, you are drawn into the story, and I'd read like half the book the very first day. It starts out in TN and ends in Texas of all places. While still nail biting suspense, the story is about True Love and Forgiveness and how far are we willing to go for another person. Some of the characters that were in the other book, will come out in this book but it's a totally different set of circumstances."}, {"userName": "Wilani Wahl", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17864113-wilani-wahl", "userReview": "Inspirational Suspense at its finest.

The subject matter was different enough to make it interesting.******Lots of spoilers here, so enter at your own risk******Marti Rushing (AKA Matty/Martha) was in an accident, charged with drunk driving; end results were her sister-in-law and brother-in-law were killed, and was told in the hospital the baby she was carrying died. Her husband was told this AND that she cheated on him, so he threw her out, filed for divorce, then went into the army.Afterward..he loses his memory in the war...anything from high school forward he has no memory of. Ironically, Marti has amnesia around the time of the accident. So neither can remember anything about the accident. She's devastated and he's furious that she killed his sister and brother-in-law and the baby, and cheated on him. And of course, they both blame God and lose their faith because of it. Typical.Marti is constantly being chased and threatened from the time she left Texas to start a new life. She has no idea why this person is doing this, but she keeps moving to elude him, but he keeps finding her and threatening her. Now, he's making physical contact, nearly killing her and keeps telling her to stay away from Texas or he'll kill her, burn the art gallery down and kill her employer/best friends.So...this is where the story takes a turn I'm appalled by...she's contacted by someone to come back to Texas for a particular reason, and she doesn't want to, but the best friend talks her into it. She's nearly died at this man's hand and been threatened in other physical ways, and now he's threatening her best friends.....but she STILL goes back??? Really???On the way there, a big pickup hits her car from behind several times trying to knock her off a curvy road....and after someone comes to help her (making the truck speed away)....she continues driving to Texas??? Then after she gets there the guy enters her room attempting to smother her with the pillow, but in nearly getting caught, the guy rushes off and....you guessed it...she stays there??? Seriously?? And doesn't see fit to tell her best friends about either incident??? Then the guy tries shooting her with a bow and arrow....and she even stays longer??? There was two other incidents, but you get the picture.Too illogical. She's seemingly not a stupid person, but the author writes her to have no sense. A lot of the rest of it is a \"who-done-it\" regarding who's trying to kill her, nobody believing her, and her attempt to get her ex-husband, Daniel, who doesn't remember her, to bring back his memory.Some of that is good and kept me reading, but when the end came, it turned into a mushy mess and totally spoiled what could have been written great and salvaged it.Interesting enough so I gave it a three, but illogically maddening, so I couldn't go higher."}, {"userName": "Daphne Self", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5552166-daphne-self", "userReview": "Hashtag: that was a good book.I enjoyed the character's quirky saying of \"Hashtag\" in front of her phrases. The story somewhat held my interest to the end, and I did enjoy the book. Returning characters from the previous Joanie Bruce book added a cute dimension.Some of the idioms used were lost on me and I had to google them to find out what they meant. I remembered my grandmother saying it at times, though.I understood the main character's determination to stay in Texas, and that she would not allow anyone to veer her off course. Toward the middle I figured out what must have happened in the beginning and was pleasantly pleased to know that I was right.If you like clean books, if you like suspense books, then A Memory Worth Dying For is perfect. Yes, it did seem a little preachy at times, but the characters were like that. I love Marti's development of faith, or her returning faith I should say. Joanie Bruce did a great job."}, {"userName": "Britney Soderberg", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32256980-britney-soderberg", "userReview": "It was good, it kept me on my toes most of the read."}], "description": "Marti Rushing gets the message, loud and clear. If she returns to Texas, her life is in danger. If she stays in Tennessee, she's safe. But when she receives a letter telling her that Daniel, her ex-husband and the love of her life, is dying, she knows she has to defy the stalker and return to Texas to see him. Three years ago, Daniel accused her of things she couldn't remember doing. Without waiting for an explanation and after four wonderful years of marriage, Daniel kicks her off of his family's Quarter Horse ranch. Now, three years after their separation, he walks into her art reception in Tennessee and acts like he doesn't remember her. Does the memory loss have anything to do with the letter she received, or is Daniel pretending? Is he the one stalking her, or is it someone with a deadly, sinister motive? Ignoring the deadly warnings, she leaves for Texas, but on the way there, the attempts on her life begin. Will she be able to evade her pursuer's attacks?
