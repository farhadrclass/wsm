Zenith hotel is about as far from this description as you can get. It's a gritty and moving account of a day in the life of Nanou, a street prostitute. not a call girl or anything like that. Just a common streetwalker with high heels and menthol cigarettes.She awakes everyday to the after-taste of other people's filth in her run down hotel room.As she says, there will be no armchair psychology here. All we get is her day, plain and simple. This one day is told through her various clients. Each has there own story to tell and each become part of Nanou's story when they choose to pay her a visit. Each seem to be lacking something their lives. Mostly respect and control. This why they seek her out. She doesn't mind the fact the probably despise her. It makes them feel more civilised.. She gives them nothing but the reflection of their own misery.In her free time Nanou writes. She doesn't really know why she does this. She refuses to see it as any type of therapy. It's just a way to keep her hands occupied. What she really seems to be doing is releasing a feeling of loathing. It's easier to hate.What is really fascinating is that although Nanou doesn't like her life, she doesn't want anyone elses either. She finds their mundane every day jobs just as sickening as her own. She will label herself a prostitute for all eternity.Zenith Hotel is pure poetry. It's a one sitting read that manages to fit more emotion into 105 pages than most novels do in 500 pages."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1119019-karen", "userReview": "This little book (just under 100 pages) certainly packs a punch and what it lacks in size it makes up for in content. The writing is brutally honest and raw \u2013 there is no sugar coating or flowery words here. We see a snapshot of Nanou\u2019s day, from her time spent in her squalid rented room to when she is out walking the street of Paris; instead of the familiar tourist destination that we know, Nanou describes the seedy and unglamorous side to the city. We know of the mundane details and routine of her daily life, for example, the local caf\u00e9 owner Jeannot who thinks she now prefers to go to a competitor simply because she no longer goes to him for her morning caffeine hit. In truth she is also desperate for a cigarette but can no longer smoke in his caf\u00e9 so has to get her coffee elsewhere. We are then with her again at night when she finally crawls into her bed, alone with her thoughts. She tells of her self loathing and of how much she dislikes her life but wouldn\u2019t want to live anyone else\u2019s.Much of the narration is by Nanou\u2019s clients, each one telling their own story of their often sad and lonely lives. At the end of their story, there is just a glimpse of their interaction with Nanou. Again, the writing is pure and minimalist and with just a few short pages the characters are bought to life. In all honesty this is probably not a book that would have come to my attention nor one that I would have sought out but it was an excellent read and I am so glad that Arcadia sent it to me. I do sometimes find that translated text can feel disjointed and \u2018clunky\u2019 but this one reads perfectly - excellent work by the translator, Ros Schwartz."}, {"userName": "Jude", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28688270-jude", "userReview": "\u2018When I wake up my teeth feel furry. There\u2019s a foul taste in my mouth \u2013 a nasty sort of animal taste.\u2019 \u2013 For Nanou, this is how each day begins. Nanou is a Parisian streetwalker \u2018Not a call girl or anything. No, a real street whore, with stiletto heels and menthol cigarettes.\u2019In Zenith Hotel Oscar Coop-Phane details the not so glamorous life lived by Nanou. The book takes the form of a one day diary, interwoven with short portraits of the men who seek solace in the withered arms of Nanou. The book is original and incredibly moving, creating a world of solitude and sadness encompassed in the actions of just one day.Nanou\u2019s story is different to how you might expect. It is not a sob story dreamt up by Coop-Phane to make a reader feel better about their own sad existence \u2013 no, it is just a day. \u2018I don\u2019t intend to go into detail and tell you about my childhood, my love life and all my woes. I\u2019m not going to tell you how I ended up like this\u2019 say Nanou, she is clear that in knowing her past \u2018you\u2019d get too much of a kick out of it\u2019, and she would not give you the satisfaction. Instead, all Nanou tells us is her day, so, \u2013 \u2018If you were expecting me to talk about rape, being abandoned, HIV and heroin, you can fuck off, pervert\u2019 \u2013 if you are looking for a misery maker this probably isn\u2019t the book for you.So why does Nanou write, if not to tell of her woes and mistakes in life? She doesn\u2019t complain, and doesn\u2019t even seem to see the worth or the point in her own writing. \u2018I don\u2019t know why I write. It churns me up, it soils me from the inside. To pass the time perhaps. That\u2019s it. I write like some people do crosswords, it keeps me busy. I think about words, style and shape of the letters. I feel as if I am doing something without getting up off my arse.\u2019The book is structured into short chapters each detailing background of each Nanou\u2019s clients \u2013 this is the only background information we are given, as though the messed up lives of her clients say more about her life than her own past \u2013 each chapter ends with a short interaction between Nanou and her client. Through each entry Coop-Phane digs into the very heart and soul of Nanou\u2019s clients, voicing their innermost thoughts, desires and anxieties, while detailing Nanou\u2019s complete lack of interest. These chapters come between passages written by Nanou herself, short ramblings scratched from the street corner, recording her day\u2019s activities and musings.Nanou\u2019s life is routine, living hand to mouth with only but the smallest of pleasures to call her very own. \u2018I drink my coffee all alone in my room. Smoking my fags. To cheer myself up, I tell myself I\u2019m saving money.\u2019 The reality is more depressing, it is not that Nanou cannot afford to drink her coffee out, but that she gave up socialising when the smoking ban was implemented, the pleasure of a combined nicotine and caffeine hit too great to spare for a chat with friends.1024px-Rotlichviertel_Frankfurt_MainHer living quarters are dismal, the shared bathroom having fallen into the bleakest state of disrepair, Nanou resorts to borrowing the bathroom of another friend, where her morning wash routine is clinical, a mere formality rather than something to be enjoyed: \u2018I wash with a mini soap. I like feeling the roughness of my skin, the way it goes taut and chapped after washing. Shower gel is too gentle. It leaves your skin slightly greasy, like when you oil it. I prefer it when my skin\u2019s dry. I feel cleansed \u2013 disinfected.\u2019After leaving the discomfort of her living quarters for a day on the street Nanou meets an extraordinary circus of men. Among them Dominic, a young man who, having been convinced of his family\u2019s desire to murder him, beat them to it and earned himself life in an institution, and Emmanuel a dreary school worker, who has no friends and spends each Saturday when his wife is away sneakily masturbating into their sofa.Of course Nanou does not really notice these men. She is not really there when she sees them, making small talk, being kind and giving them what they want is all part of the service after all. It is just as much a part of prostitution as the selling of her body itself. These men use her as escape, as a method of running away from the harsh realities of life, which she herself has come to accept. The reality is that these men do not even come close to being with Nanou when they pay for her services: \u2018I can tell you that when they screw me, when they get all horny jiggling about on top of my poor inert body, those sad suckers are well and truly alone.640px-Prostitute_tjHer work day is rhythmic, relentless and monotonous \u2018like a factory worker in a production line. The same action relentlessly for years. No hope. A little factory worker of the flesh\u2019. She gets no pleasure from the lifestyle, other than the cigarettes and coffee bought with her wages. As the day progresses Nanou\u2019s thoughts become bleaker and bleaker, as though she has an intrinsic hatred of everything she stands for. She is not self-pitying, but self-loathing, considering herself to be of no worth other than a temporary recipient of other men\u2019s primal desires: \u2018I feel hollow \u2013 as commonplace as a chamberpot that you plonk down beside the bed.\u2019The day drags on, and the money comes easily, \u2018but at what cost?\u2019 she asks herself. She works the street all day, until finally, after her sixth client and a day spent absorbing the filth of the city, it is time to go home. \u2018At last\u2019 she thinks, \u2018I can go to bed, turn on the television and light up another fag.\u2019Nanou is a streetwalker in Paris. Her heart has taken on the colour of the pavement. And when she falls asleep she knows \u2018Tomorrow is another day.\u2019Taken at face value Zenith Hotel is a striking representation of the depressing life lead by a Parisian prostitute, but it is also deeply poetic, insightful, and beautiful in a way which speaks mountains about the work of Coop-Phane. Nanou is the picture of a life lost to the grime of the Paris streets, her \u2018soul sweats the filth of the city\u2019, and her words speak volumes.Originally posted on Jade the Obscure"}, {"userName": "Etienne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11486904-etienne", "userReview": "2,5/5.

By writing short sentences in brief chapters, the author structures the novel in such a way that the physical book is exactly what it portrays inside \u2013 a snapshot of the shabby heart of Parisian life.The story is raw and shockingly vivid at times and so is not an easy read, but when you consider that the author is only young, and that this reads as if written by an older author with a lifetime of life experience then it is all the more admirable and impressive an account of a life that luckily most of us will never experience for ourselves.A book of vignettes of Paris life that fits more into its small 99 pages that most novels do in 400."}, {"userName": "Lucy Qhuay", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115693-lucy-qhuay", "userReview": "I picked this one up on a whim. Who knows? Sometimes you might be pleasantly surprised.This was definitely not the case.Zenith Hotel is narrated by Nanou, a street whore, and it tells us about how she spends one of her days. Of course, you learn that she does the exact same thing every single day, so there was no point in talking about other days.You also have a bit of the lives of her clients, like Dominic, the crazy inmate who killed all the people who lived in his house when he was a young boy, just because he was sure they planned to kill him by bashing his head in the piano; Emmanuel, the high school supervisor aka control freak aka pervert, obsessed with big boobs; Victor, the mental case obsessed with his dying dog, Baton, shit and murder and so on.Basically, everyone was damn crazy. I've never read something where every single character should be institutionalised, because they presented a serious danger to poor unsuspecting citizens, but here it is.I don't give a fuck about any prize this might have won.

It's a glimpse into a life. Set in Paris and featuring prostitue Nanou and some of her clients; this is not the exotic and glamorous Paris that we usually read about. This is the dark, the seedy, the dangerous. Nanou pulls no punches, nor does she ask for or expect sympathy. She does not try to hide what she is. She is a street-whore, plain and simple. Her daily life is described in explicit details, almost emotionless at times, with no glossing over the dirt, the smells, the squalor.And Nanou's clients; fascinating in their own mundane way. Men who are lonely, sad, maybe mad? Nanou performs a service, she is brutally honest about it. In order to convince anyone else that there is more to these encounters than just sex, Nanou would first have to fool herself. Nanou is no fool.A tiny book of just under 100 pages, please find yourself a quiet spot and savour this in one sitting.

At less than a hundred pages long, it doesn't mess around with introductions, dragging you straight in to the squalor of a Parisian streetwalker's life:'When I wake up, my teeth feel furry. There's a foul taste in my mouth - a nasty sort of animal taste. Still, it's better than at night, when I have the aftertaste of other people and their filth.'This is the start of Nanou's day, a day of great hardships and small comforts. There's very little back-story, so we don't know what's brought her to this sordid existence. She smokes in bed, drinks coffee and writes without knowing why:'It's not vital, it's not therapeutic. I don't know, I write to keep my hands occupied, like doodling on Post-its when you're on the phone. ..I'm a pen-pushing old slag. How about that?'Between Nanou's words are interludes; individual character sketches of her clients, each one inhabiting a perfectly encapsulated world. Coop-Phane bringing to life the lonely and dispossessed, the mad and sad on the fringes of existence, in a way that earns your sympathy. There's a warmth here, an affection for his characters despite, or maybe because of, their failures:'Robert is a sponge. He soaks up events and people, retaining everything in his thick, yellow foam. But, at some point, if someone grabs him, if he's crushed in the metro or in a cinema queue, he spews out everything in a stream of insults and platitudes'You begin to understand why Robert might seek small solace with Nanou.This isn't a familiar Paris but a vision of raw brutality, which makes the connections, glimpsed between Nanou and her clients, all the more extraordinary. In the midst of the detritus are precious shards of humanity. But this isn't just one day for her, it's the bleakness of every day:'The rest is chit-chat, answering their questions, laughing at their jokes - that's another form of prostitution.'The words of Coop-Phane are so much more poetic than mine that I could go on quoting him shamelessly. He was just twenty-three when he wrote Zenith Hotel, which won the Prix de Flore in 2012 and has now been translated from the French by Ros Schwartz.Coop-Phane writes with economy in short, sharp sentences which hit home and stay with you long after you've finished. This, his first published work, has a visceral power which doesn't always make it an easy read. Despite that, searching for a flaw, I could only think it should have been longer, so I wasn't able to devour it all in one sitting.

Zenith Hotel, the debut novel by Oscar Coop-Phane, is not an easy book, though it's only ninety-nine pages. It's not a moderately challenging book. Zenith Hotel is a difficult book, a demanding book. It is ninety-nine pages of exquisitely rendered portraits of the inescapable human condition we spend all of our time trying to escape: solitude.Nanou is a \"...streetwalker. Not a call girl or anything like that, no, a common streetwalker with high heels and menthol cigarettes.\" She lives alone in a squalid studio in Paris. Nanou makes no apologies or excuses; she offers no explanations. Zenith Hotel is a slice-of-life \u00e0 la Raymond Carver, a single day that represents all days; nothing changes. Nothing changes in the lives of her customers either: Dominic is mentally ill; Emmanuel is suffocating in suburbia; Victor's only family, his dog Baton, is dying; Luc is learning to accommodate his sadness, to make room for it inside his skin, so that it doesn't devour him whole; Jean Paul asks for coffee, struggling with the compromises between idyll and practicality that we all must make; Robert intermittently makes the effort to reach for what he thinks he should want, only to retreat. These men could be any one of us; they are us. Nanou is a repository. She collects and absorbs the despair and inchoate longings of the men who hire her. There but for the grace of god.Zenith Hotel is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. It is not pretty and pulls no punches. It is both sacred and profane, simultaneously subtle and in your face. If what you like most is plot or action then look elsewhere. If you require your story in a neat package with a bow on top at the end or, for that matter, a conclusion to your story, then look elsewhere. But if you are brave and empathetic and curious and tend toward the poetic, then you will appreciate this work. It's worth the effort. Be brave and curious. The author, Oscar Coop-Phane, left home at sixteen for a career as a painter. At twenty he made his way to Berlin where he began to write.

They sent me the mini-novel with the task of writing an 140 character review for twitter - I felt so modern. And now my quote is on the back of the book itself (which is published today), so exciting! So I thought it was time to write a proper review to truly honour this snapshot of literary brillianceIn my tweet review I called the story 'raw and unashamedly honest'. It follows the days of Nanou, a French street prostitute, her perspective is disjointed by the stories of her various (and very varying) clients. There is no sensationalising or glamorising in this novel, it is as purely frank as I could imagine an account of this way of life could be. What especially struck me was the base, simplistic details of each of Nanou's clients' lives that Coop-Phane tells us. The mundanity, instead of making the stories tedious and boring, increases the candid realism of the novel. Nothing is left out, and similarly nothing is unnecessarily added in. So many novels concerning abuse or prostitution are saturated in an over-exaggeration of sexual language and images, and disturbing details, I find they take away from the story and characters in their quest to shock the reader.Zenith Hotel completely avoids this trap and Coop-Phane handles such a dark theme through making it the backdrop for the stories, but not letting it dictate the entire novel. Instead, he uses the prostitution to blacken the tone of each story and exploit the desperation and isolation of the characters' lives.Inspired by this overarching quality in the book, I called it a 'flash of the unity of loneliness within the crowd of humanity' - this came out of the way the characters were so contrasting - from ex-con to caretaker to frustrated husband - and yet all linked through the extreme loneliness that drives them to Nanou. Her service becomes less sexual and more emotional - if only for a few minutes. Through this, the choice of each character becomes random, they are each a chance cross-section of humanity, through their own detachment from it they convey it in all its terrifying immensity.In my opinion, a review of a somewhat minimalist book should itself be no more than minimal. Coop-Phane leaves the book open to the reader, not to judge, but not interpret, and I can guarantee you will be interpreting it over and over again for days after you've finished it."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8532926-jill", "userReview": "This is a short book (97 pages) translated from French. It is very different to anything I have read before. The author is incredibly talented in being able to portray the characters so well in such a short book. We are introduced to Nanou who openly admits from the start to being a prostitute, not a high end hooker, but a street walker. We are introduced her world which appears to be very lonely, bare and sad. The book is written as Nanou keeping a notebook, revealing very brief snippets of her life, but I do mean brief. Nanou says from the outset that she doesn't want to reveal anything about herself and her life, and as you look back at the book you will see that she hasn't.The skill of the author in tellng Nanou's story via clients is very very clever. I felt a real sense of sadness and warmth towards her. I felt that her life was quite sordid and that she was very lonely but stuck without a way out. The brief snippets eluded, in my view, to quite a tough upbringing without the love and support to give her a decent go at life. I was fascinated by the stories of Nanou's clients. It definitely challenged by perception of the type of man who used the services of a prostitute and I was really drawn in by the stories and sadness within their lives. They really make the book. It's a bit like being a fly on the wall in these men's life and seeing how behind their public masks they all, like Nanou, are sad and feel like key things to make them happy are missing. I felt desperately sad both for Nanou and the men. They were all, Nanou included, looking for happiness, but seemed unable to find it. The act of sex seemed like a mechanical outlet for the men rather than the feeling of intimacy, love and warmth that sex should bring. I also sensed the disgust and feeling of self loathing that Nanou felt towards herself.What a fantastic book by a very skilled author. I felt so sad to leave her in the Zenith Hotel and wanted to write a final chapter where the knight in shining armour comes in and rescues her, just like in pretty woman. The book is a stark reminder of what women go through every day, invisible to most of society, and looked down on by those that do see them, and judge them without knowing anything about them or their lives.Thank you to Arcadia for providing me with a copy of the book in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kevin Freeburn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244736-kevin-freeburn", "userReview": "From https://freeburner.wordpress.comNanou is a streetwalker in Paris. Her heart has taken on the colour of the pavement. All manner of things are dropped on it, her soul trampled on. In this excellent novel she isn\u2019t about to tell the story of how she came to be in this position but instead she wishes to give us an insight into her day.Oscar Coop-Phane gives us this story through short chapters detailing the characters that she encounters in a single day in her work. The writing really burrows into the heart and soul of these characters, allowing them to voice their innermost thoughts, desires and anxieties. People adjust and get used to the things that life throws at them.Nanou sees the small talk with her clients and having to go through the motions of laughing at their jokes as being as much prostitution as the sale of her body. She feels like a factory worker on a production line, doing the exact same action for years. All over Paris and beyond people are lost in their jobs, the constant in their lives that keeps them grounded. People can walk the streets in Paris with anonymity in a world where people are always alone, even with company.It\u2019s a world where characters can be given dirty looks in the street when out walking alone, a world where we always have to be seen to be doing something at every moment. A man out walking on his own can be seen as suspicious, a man walking a dog is seen as perfectly normal.The air of loneliness flows through the book. Emmanuel has got used to his daily routine. He\u2019s solitary in his work with no friends to discuss it with. He\u2019s content with this though, having kids would disrupt his routine, change the flow of his life.Robert wonders what he\u2019d be without other people. Would he wash his hands after going to the toilet or change his socks? He unsure of how to relate to people but he puts great love and affection into looking after his trees. He enjoys the freedom of solitude.Zenith Hotel is deeply poetic, an insightful work that could certainly be revisited time and time again, such is the gravity of the prose and the fullness of the characters. It\u2019s a rare talent that can convey such depth of emotion in such a short space, every page teeming with beauty."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30529726-amanda", "userReview": "ENITH HOTEL BYO OSCAR COOP - PHANE\"SI WOULD LIKE TO THANK GRAY AT ARCADIA BOOKS FOR SENDING THIS COPY TO REVIEW THE BLURB I m a street prostitute.

Not a call girl or anything, no a real street whore, with stiletto heels and menthol cigarettes.'Nanou gives a detailed account of her day, from the moment she wakes up with a foul taste in her mouth, in her sordid rented room, until the minute she crawls into her bed at night to sleep. Interwoven with her story are stark portraits of her clients\" This is the tale of Nanou, a street prostitute, writing down the details of her day. It is interspersed with pages detailing the background of the clients she encounters on that day, each with his own story to tell. Nanou doesn't seek sympathy, she has come to accept her lot in life, believing herself to be worth nothing more and resigned to the fact that this is her lot in life until the end.This is a short novel, one easily read in a spare hour or two but one which will stay with you for much longer. It may be short on word count but each word used is perfectly placed and utilised to its full potential. This is not a light-hearted read. It's gritty, dark and bittersweet. Whilst we as readers can feel some pity or sorry for Nanou and her clients there is also some ray of hope - at least for the men in the story in that Nanou brings some form of comfort to their otherwise lonely or sad lives.This is, at it's simplest, a beautifully written tale, giving a brief glimpse into lives we normally try to forget exist. Brutal, explicit and honest, Zenith Hotel goes beyond the glamour of Paris to show an unseen society, hidden from view by our own blindness to it.Comments have been made and praise has been given about how young Oscar Coop-Phane was when he wrote this Prix de Flore winning novel (he was in his early 20s). However I think it should simply be applauded that anyone, at any age, can write with such sensitivity, insight and feeling.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3585577-kelly", "userReview": "Firstly I would like to thank the lovely Karen Sullivan and Arcadia Books for sending me an E copy of this book to review. I have heard such brilliant things about this book from fellow bloggers and knew it was one I wanted to/had to read. And oh boy am I glad I took the chance and gave it a go.Zenith Hotel at first glance certainly isn\u2019t the type of book I usually go for, in fact it is far from it. Zenith Hotel tells the story of Nanou, a prostitute and provides a detailed account of a day in her life, whilst providing insightful accounts into the lives of some of her clients.Now the premise of this book alone should have any reader hooked, believe me you might not think this is your \u201ctype\u201d of book but it is so worth taking the chance and reading this, you will not be disappointed. The first thing that struck me about the book as I was reading it, was the writing abilities of Oscar Coop-Phane. I find it incredible that he wrote this book at 20years old \u2013 it is so incredibly honest, detailed, raw, gritty and thought provoking; providing an alternative view of Paris\u2019 streets, one which is far removed from the glamour. Zenith hotel flows superbly between Nanou\u2019s thoughts and those of her clients. I easily found myself immersed within the pages of this book, the level of detail is just amazing. Each character is so well developed and portrayed, it was as though they were real and could literally step from the pages. Not once did I think whilst reading this book that it was a work of fiction, that is just how incredibly well written this book is.So for those of you who want to broaden your horizons and read a book which challenges you and depicts a life with such brutality \u2013 this is certainly a book which should be on your TBR pile this year. Oscar Coop-Phane\u2019s use of language is phenomenal and he weaves magic with his words in this masterpiece."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22404559-erin", "userReview": "Firstly thank you so much to Arcadia Books for sending me a copy of this. I was so excited to see one of my blogger friends have a mention on the jacket of this copy too!This is the first of the books that Arcadia have sent me that I\u2019ve read and it will not be the last. I wanted to broaden my reading horizons and this story has certainly done that. It is also the first book that I\u2019ve read, as far as I\u2019m aware, that has been translated from a different language.I love that it was originally in French as I can remember reading the French play \u201cHuis Clos\u201d during high school. The play looks at a different story line, although some points regarding the loneliness of the characters despite being surrounded by others (like Nanou and her clients) strikes the same note as Zenith Hotel.The story is told from and about street prostitute Nanou. It is a diary of a day in her life which really just sets the pace of the whole story. It\u2019s not a flowery romantic account of a prostitute\u2019s life that has a happy ending so you shouldn\u2019t expect that. It draws a picture of the harsh reality which rather than face head on we are happy to be ignorant about because it\u2019s not happening to us.The story tells of how the other half live, the poverty that people face and the devastating circumstances that go on in people\u2019s lives which we know, or want to know, nothing about. The story is raw and fueled by loneliness but also acknowledges the freedom to be found in solitude. It\u2019s a testament to the talent of the author, who has painted this picture of real life at a young age with the grace of a person who has an abundance of life/world experience.If you are looking, like me, to try something different then this quick read is for you, it allows you dip your toes into the pool of unease, of the unknown and of the real world."}, {"userName": "Vicky-Leigh Sayer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22088279-vicky-leigh-sayer", "userReview": "Zenith hotel is quite literally, the smallest novel I have ever read. Around the size of a small pocket guide book, Zenith hotel could be read comfortably in one sitting by the slowest of readers. That's not to say it's a short story - it isn't. Neither is it a Novella. Zenith hotel is a novel, of tiny proportions which tells a unique story.Zenith hotel is a gritty account of real life on the streets of Paris. There is no romantic talk of the river seine or the Eiffel tower, here we see the real Paris, from the eyes of prostitute Nanou and her many clients. Nanou does not want us to feel sorry for her, she is not ashamed of who she is, or what she does, she just wants to tell her story.A story that evolves over the course of one day, Nanou's day. A normal day in the life of a street prostitute. Nanou's clients are sprinkled in to the story here and there, we don't get to hear what Nanou thinks of them, we see only their background, so that we can try and figure out how and why they end up with Nanou.Nanou's clients all seem to have one thing in common with her - other than sex, and that is loneliness. Although they all have companionship in different ways, from wife's to dying pets, they are all lonely, including Nanou herself.Is this why she does what she does? We don't know as this is never addressed.It's clear that she needs the money, and that prostitution is all she has ever known. But how exactly did she end up there? It's a question you will find yourself wondering the answer to, long after you have finished the novel."}, {"userName": "Lisa Bentley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9840591-lisa-bentley", "userReview": "SynopsisThe lives of several Parisians are linked together through the use of local prostitute, Nanou.ReviewI really wanted to like this story. I had read so many great reviews about it. It was dark, gritty and was set in Paris. And ok, having had a lifelong love affair with France\u2019s capital, I was willing to see it in a less than glamorous way. However, I didn\u2019t get any of that. The setting could have been anywhere. There was no seedy underbelly of the specific location. The Arrondissements just merged into one.The story itself thinly hangs together by the encounters with the prostitute Nanou. I think the main problem that I had with the text is my original problem with short stories; they feel underdeveloped. This is especially the case with Zenith Hotel. If Coop-Phane had just stuck with the protagonist and one punter then maybe the story would have felt a bit more developed.I understand that the technique of having a few bit characters emphasises the lonely life of prostitution and the isolation that Nanou feels on a aily basis. I just don\u2019t think it necessarily worked as a short story.Furthermore, I don\u2019t think that we, as readers, were able to empathise with Nanou. She is very one dimensional and the further into the story we got, the less we seemed to know about her. She didn\u2019t develop. The story didn\u2019t develop and neither did my liking of Zenith Hotel.I was very disappointed.Zenith Hotel by Oscar Coop-Phane is available now."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10924883-jacqueline", "userReview": "This is a short, easy to read account of a day in the life of Nanou, a Parisian street prostitute who lives in a grotty room at the run down Zenith Hotel. Despite the subject matter this isn\u2019t an explicit book, but does contain some references to sexual acts.We follow Nanou\u2019s musings as she writes about her day and thoughts on her life, but with cleverly inserted detailed snippets of the lives of those she encounters - her clients. The men who lead her off the cold street into a warm room for ten minutes are all different, but their lives are going nowhere fast. They have issues, problems and worries and for different reasons take comfort in her arms.This a very descriptive book where life is presented with harsh, grimy reality and not at all sugar coated. I felt a lot of sadness too, Paris is the city of love, but this shows another side of real life, the loneliness of those who exist without the world really noticing. Nanou notices and is there for them, but who is there at the end of her day when she is back in her tired room, smoking a cigarette in silence."}, {"userName": "Tripfiction", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24495694-tripfiction", "userReview": "Novellas set in Paris (the city of sad and lonely people)Life in the raw in the French Capital is astutely observed and brought to life in this novella. A book, populated by people trying to manage their lives, their footsteps reverberating across the hard tarmac of the arrondissements, the unforgiving structure that underpins each vignette. These are everyday human stories, told with care and attention to detail.Ultimately we are all flesh and blood, with primal urges, and an innate sense of isolation that drives us to seek connection with others, in whatever form. These are mundane, urban adventures, drawing on base sexuality. Some characters take flight from everyday routine, whether in search of a green park, or another country. Others seek solace in transitory sexual couplings, or companionship in partners and in animals. But ultimately these are only brief encounters, they all come back to their lonely path, where death will come to them all."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21338012-samantha", "userReview": "I was sent this book from Arcadia publishers in exchange for a honest review. I took this with me away for the weekend, it is relatively short so I thought I would be able to finish it in one sitting, which I did. This is not my usual read, I don't think I would have chosen it, if it had been on offer, however I was pleasantly surprised. We are given a snap shop of a day in the life of Nanou, a Parisian prostitute, there is nothing sleazy about the book. Just the loneliness of her life and those of her clients. We hear from all her clients that day and this as she puts it herself is the same day after day. The story jumps between her clients thoughts and her own, there is brief speech between the clients and Nanou. All the characters in the book are well written and developed well, throughout the book.

Rather than it being a deep and meaningful book looking at her history, and how it made her turn to prostitution, instead the book focuses on just one day in her life and tells the story of the clients she meets that day.I felt like this book was full of mystery. I was intrigued to learn more about Nanou and the life she leads, yet the majority of the book explains the lives of the men she meets. Each man's story was so interesting and what I wondered as reading was whether it was the true story of their lives, or just Nanou's interpretation as to what their circumstances could be based on her interaction with them.This is quite a dark story, which was really interesting and totally captured my imagination.

It seems that the UK market is getting a ridiculous number of quite brilliant French novels lately. This is no exception. A deeply bleak portrayal of a day in the life of Nanou seen through both her own eyes and through the live of the losers who are her clients. Nanou is a prostitute, nothing fancy, not a tart with a heart; simply a common streetwalker. She lives alone and, despite hating her life, she cannot feel anything but contempt for the ordinary 9-5 lives of 'normal' people. This is rather a depressing read, and about as bleak as it could get, but well worth a read if you want to experience a bit of Parisian grit.
