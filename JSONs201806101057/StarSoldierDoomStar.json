The main character, Martin Kluge, starts the first book by escaping the Sun Works Factory, an enormous space station ringing Mercury. He flees to Earth where most people live in giant cities buried miles deep into the ground.As bad as things are under the Social Unity rule, they could get worse, and very quickly they do. The SU rulers had previously created a genetically enhanced super race called thr Highborn, designed to be their army and fight their wars for them. Unfortunately for the SU, the Highborn rebelled and attached the SU and an interplanetary war began.If they SU were the worst sort of communists, the Highborn took more or less the opposite approach, admiring the Nazis of 20th century Earth, emulating the German assumption that they were of a superior race. Genetically speaking, the Highborn were right, being bigger, stronger, and smarter than normal humans.Kluge hasn't been getting along very well on Earth and when the Highborn attack it first helps save his life. He soon finds himself drafted into a human army fighting on the Highborn side of the war, but between the Nazi-like Highborn and communist Social Unity, neither side are the \"good guys\". Kluge wishes nothing more than to find another option, possibly on Mars, home to a group of humans who have rebelled against SU but have not (yet) fallen to the Highborn, or maybe to the outer planets where there are rumors of free humans remaining...Having finished books one through three very quickly, I cannot wait for book four to be released."}, {"userName": "Mike Nemeth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5728783-mike-nemeth", "userReview": "Vaughn Heppner launches into his Doom Star series with a vengence. Marten Kluge is a pain in the neck kind of guy who happens to live in space with his parents. He didn't get much of a break growing up, and life got a lot worse when his family organized a union rebellion that was stomped by the government. Forced into a life of hiding, he helps when he can. Then his mother and father are killed and he must escape to Earth. There he attempts to blend in. But society has become Big Brother meets political correctness. He fits in about as much as a dinosaur in the Michael Crighton thriller Jurassic Park. But that's OK in Marten's case. His tenacity gets him through. And his fighter's spirit keeps him alive. The super soldiers created to protect Earth actually begin to take it over and Marten is drafted to fight. He picks the super soldiers who think humans as nothing but cannon fodder. Not good. But he stays alive. Somehow. Loved this book."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2478157-kevin", "userReview": "An interesting start to a series. Earth is under socialist rule. Vaughn makes out all socialists to be idiots. THe biggest idiots are the party leaders. This seems to me a stereotype used in these types of books. Get over that and you have a good story brewing.The oppressed are sent to war against super humans (made by humans but turned against their makers). Some who survive but are captured are offered the opportunity to join the super humans in their war. Basically slaves whichever way they look.Now that the key characters are on the side of the \"high born\" we get a little revenge against the socialists. But our hero realizes this isn't freedom and sets things up for the second book.I'm hoping this develops more into military sci-fi and not political if that is possible. At least keep the party leader character's stupidity out of the story to keep it realistic."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798841-richard", "userReview": "Bleak, dark, intense, grim, brutal, hopelessness, gloomy, suffocating...not the best way to described this quick-paced futuristic sci-fi military novel. As bleak as Star Soldier (Doom Star #1) is, I enjoyed reading this sci-fi novel and the way the story unfolded.Earth in the future is a planet ruled with an iron fist by the Social Unity, similar to 1984 or Nazi Germany, lots of paranoia. Due to overcrowding on the surface, most people are forced to live in underground cities. Planets within the solar system has been conquered and colonized and there is an enemy determined to conquer Earth as any cost. Looking forward to the rest of the Doom Star series. The one minor issue I had was the amount of typos, which was disappointing."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7142790-robert", "userReview": "I read the first book off of the Kindle Lenders Library for free. The concept is valid, the story is ok, not a lot of closure in character story lines. As soon as a character becomes interesting it dies or disappears from the story. One character is introduce then poof, never mentioned again. Maybe they reappear elsewhere? The worst thing about this book is the editing. When you have to read a paragraph three times and then still end up guessing what the author intended to say, it is not edited well. If you need a free editor, send me your writing, I will edit it for you. It won't be Shakespearean prose, but it will be understandable.."}, {"userName": "Campbell, c", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34439915-campbell-c", "userReview": "Will earth survive?Third set of books by this author.

Which leads me to believe that these are self-edited and self-published.The overall plot is interesting, although it has some holes.

The background for the story was a bit over the top in how it was set up. It also didn't really try to explain the inconsistencies inherent in the various governments, or how they came to be.
