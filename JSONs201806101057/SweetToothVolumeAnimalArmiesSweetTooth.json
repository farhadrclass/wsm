An empath of infinite power, he must feel all of the sorrow in the world to be able to channel it into this book. Because it is heart aching and heartbreaking with a depth and volume that knows no rival. It's hard to define what this book is. What it isn't is The Road. It has heart. It isn't The Walking Dead. It's minimalist. It isn't Bambi. It's not for the faint of heart. I guess it's not really hard to define this book.

When you ain't got nothing to lose, you ain't got nothing to be scared about, but all that's changed now. I think of Louise. I think of my baby... the baby I'll never know. The baby I'll never hold. Then I think of the kid... Gus. If there's even a chance that he's still alive in there, then it's a chance worth dying for. These men have taken so much from me... I ain't gonna lose him too.\nSweet Tooth's world is heartbreaking, it really is. It's a world in ruins, a world of madness and pain and hopelessness, but in the middle of all these tragedies and rage there's the sweetness of Gus. The innocence of the little hybrid kids. There's no one in the world who cares about them, so they cling to each other, they may be alone, but they're not lonely together. That innocence and that affection that they feel from one another it's such a wonderful contrast to everything else happening. From the cruelness of the lab and the madness of the tribes, from the pain of Jepperd. The kids are the heart of the story and I care about them so much.This third volume is quite intense. Jepperd and the two women are still on the quest to save Gus, but for them to have a chance, they will need some extra help and so the Mad Max-like tribes will play a big part. There's a big confrontation, some shocking moments, some things revealed, but I don't wanna say more 'cause I don't wanna spoil. If you like volume 2 you are in for a treat with volume 3.The tone was set so well from the beginning of this series, it's a great, if not really emotional, read and I'm really invested in these characters. Jeff Lemire is not only a talented writer, but a great artist too. His artwork complements the setting and ambiance of Sweet Tooth in a way that's so personal, I honestly don't think another artist could have ever manage to do the same."}, {"userName": "Julie Zantopoulos", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51094260-julie-zantopoulos", "userReview": "Unfortunately this isn't going to be a graphic novel series for me.

(I say \"appreciate\" and not \"get past\" because I honestly feel like the weirdness of the art adds to a dark story about hybrids, something that focuses on anatomical differences...)I love Gus and Jeppard and am growing more fond of all the other characters as well. I'm worried for them and I'm really appreciating how much story we get each volume and the momentum Lemire is building in each.

I thought this third volume was a lot of back tracking from Jeff Lemire in terms of the story. The whole point of the first two books is basically undone in this third book and, besides learning a few new things about Gus, thought that it was more of the same from the first two volumes. The sort of desperate survivors fighting amongst themselves kind of stuff, plus Jepperd has a real sucker punch of a revelation at the end that I thought was very clumsily put in by Lemire and felt kind of cheap. The artwork is great as always and lends itself well to the truly horrifying images in the book. Overall though I felt this was a pretty weak book that sets up the story for the next one but, looking back at the story so far, it felt a bit anti-climactic. If you're following the series then this is a book you'll have to read but is by far the weakest of the three so far. Still, hopefully it'll pick up in the next volume."}, {"userName": "Nihan", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18003226-nihan", "userReview": "En iyi ciltti! \u2764\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Stewart Tame", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame", "userReview": "I don't think it's spoiling much to say that Gus is freed from the camp by Jeppard. Anyone who didn't see that coming is so new to fiction in general that I have to question why they're starting here. This remains one of the most compelling post-apocalypse series I've read in a long time. It's rare to see an artist with such strong indie roots as Lemire so at home at a major comics publisher like DC. Standard career path would have been to keep working with D&Q, maybe publishing more graphic novels about life in Essex County, appearing in volumes of The Year's Best Comics, etc. The jump to publishing a post-apocalypse series with a major comics company, and doing it so well, is not something most people could have predicted.

This volume did well to summarize the beginning of the story as you picked it up, so hypothetically, I suppose you could just pick this one up and then read to the end. But, trust me, you don't want to. This has been one of the best series I've discovered in a long time. Maybe since Locke & Key a couple years back (and that's really saying something, guys). As I've said with prior volumes, this series can break your heart with melancholy beauty on one page and turn your stomach with brutality the next. Lemire definitely keeps you turning the pages in this one. Lemire's artistic style is sketchy and almost timid, but it's a perfect fit for this book. His only other artistic collaborator on the book is Jose Villarrubia, who is doing absolutely STUNNING color work which I'm more in awe of with each passing volume. Again, as with past volumes, my utmost recommendation. *-I read this book as digitally downloaded single issues of Sweet Tooth #'s 12-17"}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1776702-mike", "userReview": "I don't know Lemire's artwork - only what I've seen in this series - do I have to ask: are all the characters in Sweet Tooth supposed to be deformed, or is that just the way Lemire draws? I like the inks and colours, but the line work detracts mightily for me.On the plus side tho, we finally get some actual pacing and action - not just a teasing, but a real honest-to-god plot to follow. I believe that Lemire has this in mind all along, but damned if he didn't torment us with Seinfeld-esque absence-of-story until now. Even halfway through the book I felt no discernable tension and only a little actual connection to any character (and not who you'd think).I think that's why I've been so disappointed in the previous books - there's nothing to connect to, like I'm just wandering through a dream. Here I finally care about a couple of the characters (but unfortunately not the protagonist), and it's still murder to find anything that evokes interest in me."}, {"userName": "JB", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32746819-jb", "userReview": "It seems like I like each new volume better than the previous one.

We go back to the cabin where this story started. A bit of Gus' father's past is revealed. Just some clues, I bet we'll find out more in the following volumes. I liked seeing Johnny back. How he formed a similar relationship with Gus like he had with Jepperd. There's a big reveal in this volume which I won't spoil. It was something you could have guessed but I sure didn't.

We seem to have reached the middle of the story, when things pivot in a different direction, so there is more setup to be found here. I really loved the art at the start of this one - there are wordless pages telling us one story line, and then panels on the bottom of each page recounting Singh's journal.

Jepperd fights for Gus and The Preserve crumbles. During the battle, we see Gus start to stand up for himself and it's so great to see him grow up and take responsibility. We're also starting to get answers as to why the plague happened and where the hybrids came from. Things started getting REAL!! Lemire did a great job juggling both Gus and Jepperd\u2019s two stories simultaneously and then converged them seamlessly. There was so much truth to Jepperd\u2019s reflections on his wife and the details that we're keeping her alive in his mind. And the biggest shock of all came when he got confirmation that his son didn't actually die and he's very much alive. A nice reference to the first volume appeared as we find out that Gus\u2019 \u201cfather\u201d wasn\u2019t just rambling prophecies, there were actually directions to help understand what was happening. The story now takes us up North and we\u2019re left with a lot of questions\u2026 I really enjoyed how action packed this one was and that it answered more of the questions that are eating at me.

Meanwhile, back at Gus's old home, Abbot and Singh make some discoveries about who Gus's father was, and how Gus was born.This was a messy, violent volume, which raised more questions than it answered. There was a lot of action but not a lot of movement in the story. At least, though, our main protagonists are on the way to where they think they might find some answers. Abbot is in hot pursuit though, and he not only has a pack of human wolf hybrids, he also has the son that Jepperd thought was dead (twice!).Probably the only nice thing that happens in this volume is that the hybrid children are bonding with each other, and it seems to be them against the rest of the world.

The previous two volumes seemed to primarily focus on world and character establishment. They did this well, but besides the original addition of animal children to the familiar end of the world scenario. There seemed little to latch onto in terms of plot, and more specifically, how it was going to paced. For me, this volume got the ball rolling. It hints at a more expansive narrative than I originally thought would feature. It also shows the types of relationships that are being forged and how deep these bonds may eventually dig. Most importantly, I'm starting to become invested in these characters and their relationships, and this is usually a good sign for the future.The art is also slowely winning me over. It's still inconsistent, in that sometimes an expressive close up or detailed landscape fits perfectly. Other times, in static panels for dialogue, it seems rushed and overly chaotic.

There's something about a man encouraging children to be cannibals that turns my stomach. The art, while brilliant, doesn't lessen the darkness here. It perfectly captures the ugliness of the situations Gus finds himself in and made me feel like I was right there with him. There is a panel where I honestly teared up a bit as Gus hugs the other hybrid children to himself. He is such a gentle, sweet boy and he's finding himself in situations where he has to be callous and almost cruel to other people and that broke my heart to see. He shouldn't have to go through this.
