Just click here.After a few misfires with my last few visits to Harlequin land, via the KISS train, I was looking for something to reignite the fire. And yes, it was this Blaze that did just that (pardon the terrible pun).Smooth Sailing is a charming, fun read with just the right mix of adventure, drama and sexytimes. Being a Blaze, I would expect the sexytimes to be just that - sexy - and Ms Wilde delivers as always.Haley, the heroine, finds herself a reluctant stowaway on the yacht of Jeb, the wealthy playboy philanthropist she very nearly slept with a few months earlier. Jeb's trying his darnedest to get to Key West in just a few days to stop his ex-girlfriend, Jackie from marrying another man.I love the relationship that builds between the two of them - the attraction they feel towards one another is strong but because of current and past issues, they are wary and somewhat reluctant to act on it.You can sense fairly early on that Jeb knows that Haley is the one that he really wants, but bless his confused cotton socks, he keeps ploughing along the Jackie path like the Little Engine That Could (I think I should, I think I should).When Jeb and Haley do eventually get to Key West, I could just about feel their heartbreak when he leaves Haley at the port to go after Jackie. I just wanted to shout \"Don't go, you fool!!\". When Jeb does come to his senses and comes after Haley, his grand gesture was pretty sweet, somewhat crazy and very romantic.I enjoyed this and its predecessor, Night Driving, and I am really looking forward to the third book, Crash Landing. Thanks for boosting my faith in Harlequin!My rating: 4 out of 5Note: I was provided with an advanced reader copy of this book by Harlequin via NetGalley in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Sara  HarlequinJunkie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8600286-sara-harlequinjunkie", "userReview": "Smooth Sailing is a charming, witty, lusty, adventure that will leave you with a smile on your face!Ex playboy, Jeb Whitcomb, has vowed to change his way's after a breakup with an ex girlfriend.

I thought it was fairly well written, there were a lot of sailing terminology and information that I though was well done, I am a sailing instructor so it was good to see correct use of words and techniques. I liked the characters, they, like the story, were a little bit cheesy and silly but they were alright, they didn\u2019t annoy me and they were not dull.Smooth Sailing is not going to blow you away but it is an easy and enjoyable way to spend an afternoon."}, {"userName": "Readerkuna1", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9014749-readerkuna1", "userReview": "I really liked this book.

He'll be returning not only to home, but to the arms of the ex-girlfriend whom he is determined to prove he is a changed man and not the egocentric playboy she accused him of being when she broke up with him. But before leaving Jeb gives one last smashing party on his boat so as to say goodbye to everyone he has worked with on the island.Haley is one of those people, a nurse, who seems the only person who seems immune to his charms. And she's also the only woman who constituted a real temptation in his path and the only one who almost made him break his celibacy...Of course Haley has no intention to go to the party, but when her roommate accuses her of being a prude, what choice does she have but to go and prove her she's wrong? Only, maybe she's not so wrong after all, cause when Haley gets to the party and sees Jeb, she immediately turns around and starts to leave... But Jeb goes after her and convinces her to return with him. Which can prove a mistake to both of them...To try to escape Jeb's advances, Haley ends up accepting a drink from a colleague from the hospital. But that turned out to be an even bigger mistake cause her colleague has drugged her drink and Haley ends up in Jeb's room, completely blacked out.At the end of the party Jeb gets an email from his ex-girlfriend inviting him for her wedding in six days. Which is precisely the time it will take him to get to Florida if he leaves immediately. And that's exactly what what Jeb does, determined to prove to his ex-girlfriend he's a changed man and to stop her wedding to another man.When Haley wakes up, stunned and feeling lousy, she thinks her day can't possibly get any worse. Oh how she was mistaken... Jeb informs her they've been sailing for several hours and he can't return or he'll risk not getting in time to stop the wedding. But he commits to getting her on a plane back to St- Michael as soon as they get to Florida.Haley has no other option but to make the most of her forced vacation. But the two of them together 24 hours a day, in a confined space, cannot end well... The true storms of this journey will not be coming from sea, but from the effort of fighting the intense attraction they feel for each other!I liked this story a lot more than I initially thought I would. Considering pretty much all the action takes place between the protagonist couple and in a confined space, the story is never boring and the author keeps an interesting narrative which makes for a compulsive reading. I'll definitely be on the lookout for more of her books."}, {"userName": "Book Binge", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1660591-book-binge", "userReview": "R.N. Haley French is furious. For one night, she lets go of her usual boring routine, and the next she knows she\u2019s accidentally off to Florida with Mr. Sexy Superficiality, and desperately trying to forget the steamy encounter they almost shared.And in the boat, there\u2019s no escape from each other\u2026or the unfurling lust that threatens to send their self-control overboard!This is one of those stories that is rooted in a situation that is pretty serious yet manages to have so many opportunities for comedy. It\u2019s always a good thing when a man with too much money and too much time on his hands and too many willing women at his disposal decides to live responsibly and turn his life around, all for the love of a good woman. However, in this case, the woman in question is marrying another man. As an old time radio personality was known to comment: \u201dWhat a revoltin\u2019 development this is!\u201dThis story embraces a series of mishaps that puts the two main characters on a sailing vessel bound for Florida in the hopes that hero Jed can stop the wedding of the woman who precipitated his attitude and life changes. But there is one really difficult issue playing out here: the woman in question has consistently made it clear that she is not really interested in Jed. Her final ploy at getting him out of her sphere was to give him big-time hell over his playboy lifestyle and her absolute refusal to get involved with any man who treated women as he did. The other big issue in this story is his relentless and growing attraction to the other passenger on his sailing ship\u2013a nurse with whom he has collided romantically, who gets his motor going seriously, and a woman whose sense of right and wrong keeps challenging him in ways he has resisted in the past.I loved this story\u2013the seeming impossibility of the relationship Jed was chasing with that sense of panic throughout the story, the intrepid Haley who kept reminding him of so much about himself that he wanted to ignore, reminding him of so much about this relationship he was chasing he didn\u2019t want to hear, and the sense of both of them hurtling toward a future that may or may not keep them together or be the source of deep emotional hurt. It\u2019s a fun read in the truest sense of the word by an author who keeps on giving us stories we enjoy in that way that deeply satisfying and likable stories do. I think you\u2019ll want to read and enjoy this one!I give it a rating of 4 out of 5.This review was originally posted on Book Binge by Judith."}, {"userName": "Ashley F", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6185164-ashley-f", "userReview": "This review was posted on Tsuki\u2019s Book Blog on Thursday April 25, 2013.I've never read Lori Wilde but I've heard good things from others who've read her books in the Harlequin Blaze line. I thought it would be interesting to read one where they were stuck on a boat together in a non-survival way. So I held off reading it for as long as possible for reasons such as not being in the mood and other less amazing reasons.Jeb and Haley were interesting characters. Jeb was the typical rich guy who had buckets of money but no clue how to act in the world. He never worked hard or gave back and finally his girlfriend called him on it. She broke it off but agreed to reassess the relationship in one year after he proved himself to be a hard-working, charitable guy. So he heads for the Caribbean and helps rebuild a small island town.Haley, on the other hand, is a really hard worker and gives all of her time to the hospital. Her and Jeb butt heads constantly since she disagrees with his fun-loving attitude. After a party on his boat, she falls into a drugged sleep in his cabin and wakes up to find Jeb set sail for the main land. The girl he wanted to get back together with is getting married and he's crashing the ceremony.The relationship unfolds on the boat as Haley and Jeb wrestle with their attraction. Jeb refuses to sleep with her due to his vow of celibacy before reconciling with his ex-girlfriend. They go through him being sick, rescuing dolphins, and learning they are much more compatible than they ever believed.It was a cute story and I enjoyed reading it. The problem I had was the lack of conversation for me. I have very little to say about it either positive or negative. I will probably not seek out her future books nor would I avoid them. I wished the 'on a boat' portion of the book had contained a little more depth. It was a little 'we're attracted to each other but we mustn't sleep together'. I wanted more.I wanted scenes full of them dealing with being on the boat besides Haley learning how to sail. I thought they had room for beautiful moonlight scenes. I would have rather seen them later, slow-moving on the water than rushing to break up a wedding. It would have been so romantic.3 StarsPublished by HarlequinMarch 1, 2013224 PagesProvided by NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Hsiau Wei", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5122366-hsiau-wei", "userReview": "This book tell the story of Jeb, an ex-playboy who vowed to change his lifestyle when his ex-girlfriend decided to called off their relationship and she agreed to give him a year to make good of his promise. For the duration, he went to provide assistance to the recent hurricane victim and it was here he met Haley, whom for unknown reason, have make known to him that she doesn\u2019t trust him. Jeb organized a party for the locals on his yacht for his own farewell and have invited Haley to join but was rejected. However, with the persuasion from her best friend, Haley relented and found herself to be in the company of Jeb most of the night and they seem to be playing some sort of game with each other. In order to prove to herself and Jeb, Haley decided to quit their game and join a colleague for a drink. Unbeknownst to her, she was drugged and ended up falling asleep in Jeb\u2019s cabin. In the meantime, Jeb received a message from his ex girlfriend that she is getting married to her new love and the wedding is set on Saturday, few days away. Jeb, who is convinced that she is making a mistake and that her groom supposedly to be him, decided to immediately set sail to make it on time for the wedding and convince her to call off the wedding. He didn\u2019t realize that Haley is asleep in his cabin and hence, she ended up being stowed away, embarking on a journey together with Jeb. I like both the characters and although Jeb is convinced that he still love his ex, I feel that his true feeling was actually towards Haley reading thru the pages of the book.

I don't know if it's because of the spicier covers that I expect the story to be just as spicy and tantalizing.I had a hard time connecting to the characters especially Haley. I am not a fan of judgmental characters whether it be male and female and I got tired of Haley being up on her high horse. I didn't like the plot device that was used to have Haley end up stranded on Jeb's boat. And I don't like the name Jeb. LOL! A billionaire playboy should not be named Jeb. I'm sorry.Smooth Sailing was an okay read. Once Haley was stranded on Jeb's boat, the story got better and I enjoyed watching their relationship develop. I didn't fully buy that Jeb wanted to stop his ex-girlfriend's wedding but whatever works to get him to realize that he needs to stop leading a shallow life is fine by me.There's nothing new or different in this story that makes it stand out.
