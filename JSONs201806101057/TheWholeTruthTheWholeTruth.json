After reading A Handful of Time when I was a young girl, I have loved reading and devoured countless books. Even as an adult, Kit Pearson can keep my love of reading alive, and The Whole Truth is no exception! Polly and Maud are characters that are timeless and relatable. I fell in love with each and every character in this book and I never wanted their stories to end!The only reason Kit lost the fifth star for this book is because I was left with a huge unanswered question! In the book, little Polly is considered \"too young\" to know all the adult answers... but I was dearly hoping all would be revealed by the end of the story. What a disappointment that it wasn't.That aside, this is an excellent book and well worth reading."}, {"userName": "Meaghan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/740508-meaghan", "userReview": "Polly Brown and her older sister Maud are sent to live with their grandmother on Kingfisher Island, off the coast of British Columbia, after their father dies under mysterious circumstances. The two girls adapt to their new life, but the secret of what really happened to their father always lingers just beneath the surface. Set during the Great Depression, The Whole Truth is Polly's story from the time she comes to live with her grandmother at age 9 until she's almost 13 and getting ready to go away to boarding school in Victoria.Kit Pearson was one of my absolute favourite writers when I was a child so I'm always happy to find a new book by her. The cover blurb on The Whole Truth says \"Pearson's gift is to always write straight from the well of childhood feeling,\" and it's true: she has a knack for conveying a child's thought processes and the ways in which children perceive the world. I thought this came across particularly well in her last book, A Perfect Gentle Knight, which is outstanding. The Whole Truth doesn't quite match up to it, but it is still a great read and Polly is a believable, relatable protagonist. She struggles to understand the behaviour of the older characters around her, including her grandmother, who is very kind to her but possibly prejudiced towards others, and the rather confounding Maud, who becomes a religious zealot after going to boarding school. At the same time, she's trying to find her own identity: she goes through fairly normal things like nervousness about boys and flirting with vegetarianism all while dealing with the intense secrets of her family history and trying to discover where she fits in with her new family on the island.The main theme of the book is this understanding of self and of others; the story is told in a somewhat episodic style that allows Pearson to illustrate this theme through Polly's experiences with several characters and incidents. This isn't a book where everything ties together neatly at the end. It's a chronicle of life on one small island seen through the eyes of one young girl. The idyllic and beautifully-drawn island setting should bring back memories of childhood summer days spent adventuring outdoors with friends and family. But the stress Polly suffers having to keep her family's deep, dark secret is always there, intruding on her happy new life. In a way, it's like Pearson is telling two separate stories that don't quite mesh, somehow. Polly's past with her father is certainly the main focus of the novel, but the balance between that aspect of her life and her new life feels slightly off, particularly in the novel's resolution, which is almost anticlimactic. If Goodreads allowed half stars, I would give this 3.5."}, {"userName": "Vikki VanSickle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237983-vikki-vansickle", "userReview": "Canada, 1932. Shy Polly and her bold older sister Maud have been taken in by their estranged Scottish grandmother after the shocking and untimely death of their father. They\u2019ve traveled halfway across the country, from Winnipeg to a remote island off the coast of B.C. to Gran\u2019s house, where there is no indoor plumbing, no electricity, and a whole host of friendly, gregarious strangers and more than a few chickens. When Maud takes off for boarding school less than a week after their arrival, Polly is not sure she can survive. But within a few months she has a new friend (easy going Biddy), a new hobby (painting), and a new pet (the naughty but lovable Tarka- you can tell Pearson adores dogs by her loving and accurate descriptions of him). But on the edge of all this happiness is the truth that Polly and Maud have sworn to keep secret, the truth regarding their father and his unusual demise.The missing/dead father plot adds tension and mystery to to the story, but for me it takes a backseat to the wonderful coming of age portrait Pearson has created in this novel. Watching Polly bloom is an absolute pleasure. Pearson manages to bring her young protagonist out of her shell without straying from the bones of her character. I enjoyed Polly\u2019s struggle with meat-eating, given her tender hearted feelings towards animals. Her relationship with the headstrong and fiercely opinionated Maud is aptly complicated and gives Pearson a stage to explore Polly\u2019s growing autonomy. I love how Pearson surrounds Polly with a cast of warm and loving characters that are far from perfect, but provide the support that Polly was previously missing in her life.Pearson\u2019s gifts as a writer are innumerable, but what makes her books classic is her uncanny ability to understand and empathize with the adolescent mind. She taps directly into the core of childhood and addresses all of the fears, anxieties, and joy of that narrow slice of time between the ages of 9-12. She is one of my writing mentors, a gifted wordsmith who has perfected the art of the middle grade novel***. Her books always feel timeless, regardless of the era they are set in, which just proves that great writing never goes out of style."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7423486-rachel", "userReview": "I didn't think that Kit Pearson would still impact me so strongly as an adult. I read all of her books at a middle school age but before starting to read this one, I assumed that I would not feel the same way about her writing. This was an unfounded assumption. Her style of writing is brilliant -- she captures Polly's character flawlessly, and does well to write on a theme that all children know well (that the adults in their life will not tell them \"the whole truth\" because they have decided the child is \"too young\"). I also love how the Canadian setting is at the heart of the story -- Pearson never forgets to make the background an integral part of her novels, which gives her writing complexity and depth. I love how Canadian this novel is! Despite being set in Depression times (which mainly helps to drive the plot forward), I think that Polly's character is so completely relatable, even to an adult looking back on their childhood. I loved it, and it has renewed my faith in Pearson, and the future of Canadian YA lit."}, {"userName": "JennLynn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6106818-jennlynn", "userReview": "A wonderful story set in the Depression.

Polly and her fifteen-year-old sister Maud leave Winnipeg to go live with the Grandmother they can\u2019t even remember who lives on an island outside of Victoria. Leaving everything they know behind, the girls move to the small island with the family they don\u2019t even know. While Maud is sent to a girl\u2019s school in Victoria, Polly goes to the local school on the island and adapts to her new life. But Polly\u2019s secrets are becoming difficult to keep, not to mention her family seems to be keeping secrets from her. As Polly grows up on the island, she learns that the truth really can set you free.I was a really big fan of Kit Pearson when I was younger, so when I saw this book in the bookstore I knew I had to find it at my library. The Whole Truth begins in 1932 during the depression. While Maud and Polly lived in poverty in Winnipeg, their Grandmother is quite well off and the family hunts, fishes and grows their own vegetables so they never have to worry about food. This book is mainly about Polly growing up, dealing with losing someone and struggling with secrets. Polly also learns that the people in her life are neither good nor bad, but often somewhere in-between. While I enjoyed the setting and the themes, this book didn\u2019t live up to my expectations. While there are many children\u2019s books that can be loved by anyone, I\u2019m not sure that this is one of them. I felt like this was written specifically for children Polly\u2019s age and the writing style was too young for my taste. The plot dragged a bit mid way through and sometimes the pacing didn\u2019t feel right. However, I thought the characters were realistic and I liked how the reader was shown the good and bad sides of many of them. I felt a lot of what Polly was feeling, especially her frustrations with Maud and her sadness upon hearing about her Grandmother\u2019s flaws. While it was an interesting story with a beautiful setting, nothing lived up to my memories of how wonderful Kit Pearson\u2019s other books are. This made me want to re-read some of Pearson\u2019s books (specifically The Sky is Falling) to see if they are as good as I remember or if they are more for younger children and won\u2019t be as appealing to me now. If you are interested in Kit Pearson\u2019s books, I\u2019d recommend starting with The Guests of War trilogy and skipping this one for now. However, I think The Whole Truth would be most enjoyed by young girls, especially if they are interested in historical fiction (like I was.)3/5"}, {"userName": "Iris", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16833181-iris", "userReview": "\"The Whole Truth\" is in every way a mystery, a realistic fiction and coming-of age story. When Polly and her sister Maud are sent away to live with their grandmother on Kingfisher Island because their father was said to have mysteriously drowned, all is lost. Polly mourns the loss of him, missing two full weeks of school once she arrives there. But Maud on the other hand, is ecstatic about her boarding school, St. Winnie's and in no time escapes in a world of religion and acceptance. She becomes a full full time boarder and can only come home twice a year. Polly is confused; where is her sister when she needs her the most! She can't stop thinking about her father, but not for the reason everyone around her believes. Here's where the mystery kicks in; Maud and Polly have a dark secret that will cut ties with their family, their friends and their future; their father is alive. He was \"set up\" to steal a large sum of money from the bank and then \"staged his death\" so that he could move to Ontario and get a job to support his two daughters. But as soon as Polly begins to like her life on the island, and begins to accept the \"loss\" of her father, he comes back to visit. It's a commotion of distrust, prejudice and faithfulness after that, but it gets better....

And it's easy to get into Polly's head; all of her motivations and logic and feelings seem pretty on par with people that age. However, what really bothered me about this book was the amount of irrelevant information that we had to read about. For example, what does Polly's brief (and failed) attempt at vegetarianism contribute to the story? There just seemed to be a lot of irrelevant details, and characters, that we had to read about even though they weren't terribly interesting and served no purpose to the story. It also really bugged me that we never found out what the big fight between Polly's parents and grandparents was about, especially since it got mentioned so often. So overall, it was a quick and easy read, had some interesting bits about Canadian history, but wasn't terribly interesting and would have definitely been better for a younger audience."}, {"userName": "Anne Patton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6957038-anne-patton", "userReview": "Set during the Depression, this book starts when two impoverished sisters are suddenly wrenched away from their familiar life.

Maud is a forward-looking young lady who embraces her new life at boarding school in Victoria. For three years the sisters conceal dark secrets about their father. Told through Polly's eyes, the tale shares her grief, loneliness, anger, betrayal, and joy as she navigates through layers of secrets before she learns 'the whole truth'. Which, in fact, is not the whole truth and that is why there is a sequel.As an adult reader, I enjoyed the leisurely pace, describing domestic life on a west coast island.
