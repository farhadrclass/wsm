I finished it a couple of hours ago and I'm still thinking about it. It was one very emotional read, filled with so much angst, violence, and thankfully, love, and although it was beautifully written, at times it was very tough to read. By the time I finished, I had a headache from crying and my stomach was tied up in knots. But darn it, I wanted more! I'm dying to know what happens next with Hunter and Loretta.At times both Loretta's and Hunter's stubborness drove me crazy, but I couldn't blame either of them for it because I could see how each thought their way was the right way. I loved Hunter and Loretta together, but at times I feared that they were never going to make it. They just had so many obstacles in their path, and I was wondering if there was even a way for them to be together. I shed many a tear over their relationship, from Hunter's patience with Loretta regarding their eventual lovemaking (which was beautifully written), to when Loretta felt she had no choice but to leave Hunter but left her bloomers behind for him to remember her. Aww... They had such an up and down relationship, but when the chips were down, it all came down to love, trust, and forgiveness. Did they love and trust each other enough to go on together? Could they forgive the wrongs done to each of their people and make a fresh start?I also enjoyed reading and learning about the Comanche, their customs, their language, and their battle with the 'white eyes'. It was very hard and sad to read about the raids on each side, but so essential to the story. Very nice history lesson. What can I say about Hunter? So fierce, so sexy and stubborn, but gentle and good with the people he loved. His treatment of Amy after she was captured just about broke my heart. And when he told Loretta he loved her and she said she'd never be able to love him...ah, that just about killed me.I also have to mention Loretta's cousin Amy, who at times almost stole the book. What a feisty courageous girl! At times I liked her better than Loretta! Although I couldn't really believe that after what happened to her when she was captured by Comancheros, she was able to carry on and recover the way she did. Surely she's going to suffer some PTSD? Although to the author's credit she did have Hunter mention that he thought that in her mind, Amy was running from what happened to her. I suppose the next book, \"Comanche Heart\", will address that. This was a wonderful, but not always easy to read book, and fans of Catherine Anderson should not miss this one, because it's definitely one of her best. Just be prepared to shed a few tears, and have the kleenex handy. There is a HEA, but there is a long, tough, road before you get there! 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3820197-jill", "userReview": "After surviving an attack by Comanches that killed her parents, Loretta Simpson has been left emotionally scarred, unable to talk. Now living with her aunt, uncle and young cousin, she helps out on their farm. A prophecy given to Hunter of the Wolf, a Comanche warrior, foretells of his destiny with a golden-haired woman. But Hunter has no love for whites after they killed his wife and many of his people. Originally released in 1991, this romance holds up surprisingly well after twenty-plus years. This is probably my third read (maybe more), and unlike many older Native American romances, \nComanche Moon\n is well-written without the ubiquitous purple prose that seemingly defined the historicals of this era. Ms Anderson's research into Comanche culture, along with the use of many Comanche words adds a realistic touch.It\u2019s not without its faults though. The story is somewhat long-winded, and the back-and-forth between Hunter and Loretta dragged on for too long. There are some inconsistencies in characterisation. As much as I'm all for authenticity, and knowing these were often very violent times, the rape of a 12 year-old girl by a group of men continually over days, was (despite there being little descriptive details) unnecessary and excessive. The dialogue and story tend at times to lean towards the cheesy. And some phrases were repeated a lot....forever with no horizon...my heart is laid upon the ground... and my personal favourite...this Comanche, eh?Nevertheless, \nComanche Moon\n is still a good read, with the strength here being Catherine Anderson's strong story-telling and writing. It\u2019s not in the same class as my favourite, and in my opinion the best Native American historical romance ever - \nDancing on Coals\n by Ellen O\u2019Connell. But after three reads and over twenty years, this remains one of my top picks in Native American historical romances, despite its faults.Steam: 2.5"}, {"userName": " Lady Jayne *~*The Beach Bandida*~*", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1453659-lady-jayne-the-beach-bandida", "userReview": "5+ Stars!I decided to do this \u201creview\u201d in an epistolary format.My Dear Goodreads Friends,MelissaB recommended Comanche Moon as a good \u201cNative American\u201d Romance. Thanks, Melissa! Then, I noticed Comanche Moon was a popular recommendation in the Secret Santa \u201cgift\u201d exchange on the We Love Lisa Kleypas Group, being recommended several times. After being unable to decide what to read as my first read of 2011, and deciding to blindly choose from a selected pile of books that I was most looking forward to reading, the fates led me to Comanche Moon! And I must say that it was a great book to start the New Year with! I LOVED it!!!I definitely recommend this book to any romance reader, not only those interested in a good NA Romance, but those looking for an amazing, memorable, powerful, emotional and honestly portrayed love story that will stand the test of time, ie. something to add to your \u201ckeeper\u201d shelf.Ms. Anderson\u2019s writing was vivid and made me feel like I was actually there in 1859 Texas, among the Comanche nation. I felt like I was watching this beautifully honest and aching love story unfold before my eyes. I loved and appreciated the realism Ms. Anderson portrayed in the slow progression from hate to friendship, and eventually, to love, between the orphaned Loretta, who had witnessed the brutal attack and killing of her parents by Comanches, and Hunter of the Wolf, a Comanche warrior whose pregnant wife had been viciously raped by the \u201cWhite-Eyes\u201d, and died as a result of her horrendous internal injuries. The journey from hate to love was certainly not an easy one (as one would expect) and I even wondered if these two would have their destined HEA - I ached for them. But what I, personally, loved most about this book, was the hero, Hunter. The depths of patience, gentleness and kindness he showed Loretta (and also her cousin, Amy, and his own blinded-by-hate cousin, Red Buffallo) made me fall madly (literarily) in love with his character, and he is now among my fave heroes, and certainly my fave NA hero! *sighs*I was so impressed, and even more intrigued and excited to read Comanche Moon, after having read Catherine Anderson\u2019s Letter to the Readers included at the beginning of the long-awaited 2008 reprint, that I have decided to share it with you here (below) in the hopes that in will encourage you to read this amazing book, too.I\u2019m so pleased that this book has been reprinted and is available for a reasonable price, so that I was able to enjoy it\u2026. and you can, too! So far, three of the Comanche books have been re-released: Comanche Moon, Comanche Heart, and Indigo Blue. The 4th book in the series Comanche Magic will be re-released on 3rd May 2011.If you haven't read this book, I hope that when ^_~ you read this, that you will love it as much as I do!Your anxiously-awaiting-to-see-what-you-think-of-this-book friend,JayneP.S. Read. This. Book! ^_^Dear readers,For many years now, I have received letters from you about my out-of-print historical romances. Where might you find them? Why do they cost so much? When will my publisher reprint them? I kept promising you it would happen, but as time wore on, even I began to wonder if it ever would.Now it finally has! New American Library/Signet recently purchased the rights to the first three of those out-of-print books, and Comanche Moon, originally published in 1991, is the first to be reissued. I am so excited! To all who have waited so patiently for this day to arrive, thank you. To those who are confirmed contemporary fans, please consider taking this journey with me into the past. A great love story transcends time, and I\u2019m confident that Comanche Moon will touch your emotions and linger in your memory.Comanche Moon was a true labor of love, a book that came straight from my heart. When it was first offered to publishers in the late \u201880s, editor after editor rejected it because the story broke so many established rules of the romance genre. I was asked to change the book if I wanted to sell it, but I refused. In many ways, Comanche Moon is a tribute to a wonderful people, the Comanche nation, and after doing four years of research, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to betray them or their culture by altering the story to fit a mold. I believed that readers were more sophisticated than some editors thought, and I was confident they would love the book just as it was, if only they could get the opportunity to read it.I was right! When Comanche Moon finally made it into print its honesty and uniqueness were eagerly embraced by readers, and I will always feel that this story set the tone for my entire writing career. My readers came to expect books from me that didn\u2019t always follow the conventions, emotionally powerful stories that depict the miracle of true love in trying real-life situations.I regret that this book has been so difficult to find for so long. The first print runs were small, and many readers kept their copies because the novel was so well liked, making it even harder for other readers to find. Now, at long last, you will be able to purchase as many copies as you wish.I hope you enjoy Comanche Moon as much as I enjoyed writing it, and that it finds a prominent place on your keeper shelf as one of your all-time favourites.All the very best,Catherine AndersonDear Ms. Catherine Anderson,THANK YOU for not giving up on this book! THANK YOU for not compromising your beliefs in this story, in order just to get this book sold! This reader truly appreciates the research you put into it, and the respect you showed to the Comanche nation in this story. Bravo! I loved this book, that clearly came from your heart, and it has definitely made it into my \u201ckeepers\u201d shelf. What an amazingly different, honest, real, heartwrenching and achingly beautiful Romance! I am so glad that the publishers took a chance to publish this in 1991, but even more thankful that it has been re-released and that I only discovered it now. I look forward to reading the rest of the Comanche series and your other books.\"Suvate\". It is finished. But it will remain on in my heart ... and in my future re-reads! ^_^A very thankful and happy reader,JayneEdited to add: My Loretta and HunterAlso reviewed at: Lady Jayne's Reading DenCOPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER: I do not hold the copyright to any of the images used in this review.

I stayed up almost to 2:30am at night reading it (although I try to go to bed semi-early on the weekends because it messes me up for the weeknights since I have to get up really early), but finally made myself put the book down and go to sleep. First thing the next morning I started reading it again, until I had to go pill my cat, and ended up moving onto my chores. I went the whole gamut of emotions reading it. It reminded me why I avoid books focusing on the Indian-Settler conflict. It is a very real and heartbreaking subject for me. I hate that large groups of the native peoples were exterminated, and most were driven to the edge of extinction, and now some of the tribes are barely hanging on. I definitely feel for the Native tribes, although I don't agree with slaughtering of homesteaders that was done. There is no \"white hat\" and there is no \"noble savage.\" Just humans with different goals in conflict with each other. It is a complicated issue, with atrocities (and evil people) on both sides, and Catherine Anderson did a fantastic job of evenhandedly covering the issue. I haven't read one of her books for a while (just have been reading a lot of paranormal and urban fantasy and not too much mainstream contemps, and I had read most of her more recent historicals). And the funny thing is people look down on romances. I don't think a non-fiction book could have given me this experience as well, because the emotional component was there as we had Loretta who represented the settler side, and Hunter who represented the Native American side. Loretta and Hunter were three-dimensional, well rounded characters who you feel for and fall deeply in love with. Many times I could not find fault at the \"wrong actions\" of the characters because their motivations were very real. I would not want to be in any of the character's shoes for a moment. And to think that people like Cynthia Ann Parker, Quanah Parker, Geronimo, Sitting Bull, and many others from history lived it. It was a beautiful love story, with its share of heartrending, heartbreaking, and distressing moments. Many times I wondered how a happy ending could come out of it, but I was satisfied with the ever after for the couple, although you know that future for the Comanche people is bleak. If you want to read a wonderful love story that is at times brutal but also beautiful, I heartily recommend this book. There is no question that Ms. Anderson thoroughly did her research. I checked the article on Wikipedia about the Comanche and the Comancheros and she was spot on. I can't wait to read Comanche Heart, the story about Amy and Swift Antelope. What happened to Amy is beyond distressing. It still comes to my mind and I am filled with rage. But I was thankful that she was able to move past it and find a love with Swift Antelope that I would like to get closure on. It comes out in Spring of 2009 as a rerelease. Boy am I glad that they rereleased these books."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48855204-michelle", "userReview": "Magnifico, \u00fanico, inolvible!!

Native American heroes are some of my favorites, although they are sometimes tough to read due to the tragic nature of their lives. This was most definitely a brutal story, and I feel that I must add disclaimer about one aspect. There is a scene that is NOT explicit, but that alludes to the repeated rape of a twelve year old, and gives some visuals of the aftermath. I was a little floored, because I really didn't expect that to happen, and it colored my perception of the rest of the book. Just put a downer on my feelings, and I kept getting little flashbacks. Maybe I could have moved past it if I didn't have daughters that age, but for me, I really don't like rape in my romance. It pulls me away from the happy ever after and all I can think about is violation a sadness.However, the rest of the story was just what I wanted and expected...the language barrier wasn't there, because Hunter is half white and understands a lot of English. I love the CLAIMING part of this romance. Hunter very quickly realizes that he wants this white woman for more reasons than that she fills the prophesy of his Comanche people. She is brave and beautiful and fierce, albeit a pain in his ass most of the time. Loretta is, understandably, scared half to death for most of the book. She's a pretty strong willed girl, and her past is just as tragic as Hunter's. The Comanche warriors brutally raped and tortured her mother and killed her father when she was young, so she has a very solid and well deserved prejudice against them. However, there was something about her character that annoyed me. Her repeated attempts at escape were so juvenile and spur of the moment, and I started rolling my eyes at some of her antic. Girl needed to use her brain a little more at times.Despite a few minor quibbles, I will most definitely be moving on. The next story is about the girl who was violated in this book and the young Native American boy who brought her back from her despair."}, {"userName": "Shawna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802746-shawna", "userReview": "5+ stars \u2013 Frontier/Western/Historical RomancePowerful...that\u2019s the one word that I would use to describe this book.So much has been said about \u201cComanche Moon\u201d and there are numerous glowing reviews, and for very good reason. There\u2019s no way that I can adequately summarize this phenomenal book or do it ample justice with a review, so I won\u2019t even try. It\u2019s simply earth-shattering, extremely moving, and heartbreaking in its depiction of the brutal cost of war and senseless violence and the infinite power of forgiveness, understanding, and love. When reading this heartrending account of the conflict between white settlers and the Comanche people, with hatred, fear, ignorance, goodness, cruelty, innocence, vengeance, and bloodshed on both sides; I kept thinking how distressing it is that humankind still hasn\u2019t learned from violent histories and past mistakes. All over, there are conflicts and atrocities that mimic the tragedies of the past. Will we never learn? Some stories turn fuzzy, fade, and are hard to recall after time, but some make such a deep emotional impact that they stay with you for a long time, perhaps forever, and Loretta and Hunter of the Wolf\u2019s saga that is \u201ctwo people against a world of hostility\u201d finding peace and love is definitely one of those for me.

Enjoyed how the author weaved her tale of love and hate--prejudices. Loretta Jane Simpson was in her 20's living with her mother's sister, Rachel, and her abusive husband, and their child, Amy Rose (age 12) somewhere in Northwest Texas. Loretta witnessed her mother and father get slaughtered by a group of Indians 7 years earlier and hadn't talked since. There was a prophecy that the Comanches believed about a yellow-haired woman, who didn't speak, would meet and love Hunter of the Wolf. There was a lot more to the prophecy and it played out, gradually, throughout Comanche Moon.Both Hunter and Loretta developed so much from the beginning to the ending. Remarkable, unforgettable tale of love between two opposites. Both stubborn mules at times. Hunter, bless his heart, had his hands full with two \"yellow-haired\" females that he didn't understand. His talks with his own parents about his situation were humorous. His mom was a hoot! Comanche Moon shows the dark side of both White and Indian cultures, but also shows how alike they were. Loving their wives, children, parents. Being torn from both worlds and accepted by neither forced the couple to venture to new ground and begin again. So looking forward to the next book in this series, \"Comanche Heart\" and know it picks up several years AFTER \"Comanche Moon\" with Amy Rose and Swift Antelope. First Review: (May 29, 2008)Loved it! Hands down one of the best historical westerns I have read in a very long time. This is book #1 and a reissue of this series from the early 90's. I see now why there was such an outcry for more copies. The author mentions in her Preface that she spent 4 years researching the Comanche culture prior to writing this. It showed. Very well written!This was a long book and I found it very hard to put down. Some of the events were sickening and cold blooded, but so was the history between the two cultures (White and Indian). Both main characters were well developed and I became very attached to them. I'm glad to see their children have a stories in books #3 and #4....The way the prophecy played out was awesome. Felt the characters grief and happiness throughout the tale and loved (LOVED!) reading about the lifestyle of the Comanche Indians. Interestingly enough, I've been to Palo Duro Canyon. It's near Amarillo, Texas. Wonderful romantic western and another for This Reader's Favorites Shelf."}, {"userName": "Miss Kim", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/925549-miss-kim", "userReview": "This book is incredible! Wonderful! Thought provoking! Heartbreaking! I couldn\u2019t keep my nose out of it for the past two days. At one point I misplaced it, and all hell broke lose.

Turns out, a dog had shoved it under my bed, but anyway, back to the review \u2013 I\u2019ve read a few frontier historicals, and I\u2019m realizing they are becoming one of my favorites. The harsh lives these people lived are incredible. The conflict between the whites and Indians was so awful. In this story you are thrown into the struggle between them, and how tragic it was on both sides.Loretta\u2019s parents were murdered during an Indian raid 7 years earlier, and she witnessed the brutal rape and slayings. Now she is 20 years old, and mute. Since the attack she cannot speak. She lives with her aunt and uncle and young niece on their farm.Hunter of the Wolf\u2018s wife was raped and murdered by white men, while she was pregnant wit his child, years ago. Now he must live a song that tells of him falling in love with a white woman who cannot speak.Their story is worth every minute it takes to read it.

La escritora se sale por completo de los t\u00f3picos, y no es s\u00f3lo una historia de amor sino que va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de eso. Es una lucha entre dos pueblos, la historia de dos personas que odian por completo lo que el otro representa, el dolor de tantas desgracias y la muerte de forma brutal de muchos a los que amaban.Los personajes est\u00e1n muy bien construidos, incluso los secundarios, y las relaciones est\u00e1n perfectamente elaboradas. La relaci\u00f3n de Cazador con sus padres y su hermano, incluso con su primo, es muy tierna. El amor de Loretta, Amy y Rachel tambi\u00e9n es muy bonito. Incluso las relaciones entre otros personajes del poblado.La autora consigue bien hacernos ver que no hay buenos ni malos, hay bandos como pasa en toda guerra o conflicto. Llega un punto en que ambos cometen tantas atrocidades que las reivindicaciones de unos y otros dejan de importar y se centran en devolver da\u00f1o por da\u00f1o e incluso en multiplicarlo si se puede convirti\u00e9ndose en una espiral de la que no se puede salir. Cazador y Loretta est\u00e1n precisamente en medio de esa espiral.\"Cuando el horror era insoportable, justificaba las acciones de los indios recordando c\u00f3mo hab\u00edan atacado antes su poblado. Recordaba a un anciano fr\u00e1gil que muri\u00f3 cuando trataba de salvar a un ni\u00f1o. Pensaba en aquella india aterrada que corr\u00eda para salvar su vida y la de su hijo, y que fue atravesada por detr\u00e1s con el sable. Se dio cuenta ahora de que no hab\u00eda buenos ni malos, ni cosas que estuviesen bien o mal, solo gente luchando por sus vidas. Gente maravillosa, que viv\u00eda, y amaba, y re\u00eda.\"Lo que m\u00e1s me ha gustado es que Cazador es un indio en todo el sentido de la palabra, lucha por su gente, corta cabelleras que luego tiene en su tienda y se lleva botines de aquellos que mata. Y a ella la trata como lo har\u00eda un indio, especialmente al principio. No nos endulzan las cosas, pasan desgracias que te encogen el coraz\u00f3n, porque fectivamente, esas desgracias pasaron.

I was fascinated and appalled all at once as I was reading. Once you finish, you can understand why Anderson had a hard time selling this book when she first tried back in the late 80's (as she mentions in the preface). There's nothing pretty or gentle or sweet about the story. It does have its sweeter moments, but for the most part it's harsh and brutal and thought-provoking. Yet at the same time, it is still a rather beautiful tale.As a person living in the modern world, as you read the book, you have to force yourself to set aside your beliefs and morals and allow yourself to accept the way of life as it was back then. People acted differently, relationships were different. There were times when reading this book that I was appalled and fascinated and fought an overwhelming sadness. Because while this book may be fiction, there is more than a hint of truth to the theme of tale - about the cyclical conflict between the white man and the Indians (Native Americans, if I want to be P.C.). Anderson spares us none of the harsh realities in this book, and you're constantly questioning yourself about what was right and what was wrong - who was right and who was wrong. And in the end, you realize, as Loretta did, that there wasn't really a right or a wrong, that things were what they were, and all you could do was make the best of it.And though there was a happy ending for Loretta and Hunter, I was still a bit sad when I finished because at this present time, the history of the Native Americans has already been written - and it wasn't a pretty tale. And you know that Warrior's words about how his People will go with the wind are true."}, {"userName": "\u2661Karlyn P\u2661", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1131400-karlyn-p", "userReview": "Wonderful western historical romance. Catherine Anderson really can weave a great story with heart pounding action and a tender passion between two very different people. I really enjoyed this one, and I plan to continue to read more in this series. My only negative was that I listened to this one on my iPod, which I honestly would not recommend. I wish I read it instead of listened to it. Although the story itself was amazingly good, the reader's voice left much to be desired. At times you can hear her swallow and smack her lips, but most annoying was the voices for Hunter and Loretta. The dialog was read sooooo slow and didn't flow well, and it was hard to imagine Hunter as a warrior when he sounded like an alien learning english. I've listened to a few hundred of books so I can easily seperate story from the readers voice if need be, but this one was a stretch even for me!

Tragically bad? Majestically bad? Unfailingly bad? Insanely bad? Do you get that I think it's bad?I subjected my ears to 21 hours of this garbage. It was awful.Here is what happens in the book. There is some sort of a prophecy (Always a good start right?) where a Comanche warrior is going to meet a \"honey haired\" woman and ummm... get it on with her I guess... and then they will... move west. The Comanche warrior, Hunter of the Wolf, whom I might add never hunts any wolves ever in the book, is on a raiding party to get revenge on the white settlers that slaughtered his first wife. And a blond woman comes out (the honey haired one) and through some weird complications offers herself up as prisoner to the Comanches to save her family. Then guess what happens? Yep they fall in love. It's just like beauty and the beast. Only you know how that was a half decent movie? This is less than a half decent book. Loretta (aka honey hair, aka little wise one) comes to live with the Comanches, respect their ways and convince the dude to let her go free. The whole time (despite five separate instances of ripped bodices and three instances of \"too generous necklines\") she never loses her \"purity\" with the guy. Even though it is very obvious she wants to even if she won't admit that to herself. Once back at her place, she decides she can't live without the guy and goes back to his home willingly this time (Beauty and the Beast again). The main reason for this is that no one believes she \"kept her purity\". And so I would think she would just go back and be all into the guy right? Nope. She (quite unbelievable to me) convinces Hunter to get a priest to come and marry them so it is all on the up and up, even if she is the only one who knows that. Well, the only white person who knows that and in Loretta's world apparently only white people's opinions count. And then what does she do? She won't let him touch her for two months after they are officially married even though, well she wants to, you can tell. She asks Hunter' \"Why would you want to be with me?\" and I as the listener, said to myself, \"Not for any good reason, that is for sure.\" But I guess he likes her and decides to change his white man killing ways. But white people are jerks and still kill the Comanches a lot so Loretta is this time captured by white mercenaries and Hunter has to go and get her back. Only she escapes first and he gets to pretty much meet up with her at her house instead. And they are even more in love now, only this time, she is pregnant too. Yay! They decide to move west and umm... I dunno I guess the whole Native American slaughter thing is ok now cause they got to umm... move west.But there are a few utterly bizarre things about this book that don't involve the plot. The first is this. It is sort of written well. The author has great descriptions of the plains and western life and you feel like you are there. But she immediately spoils it with dialogue like, \"Lordy what can have happened to my pantallettes?\" or \"If you are not with me my heart will be on the floor. This is a promise this Comanche makes for you.\"Yet the author goes to the trouble of putting real Comanche words in so she can respect the culture, but not enough to make them anything more than broad shouldered, well muscled, savages that all wish they were with white women. (Except for the one guy who is the bad Comanche, he doesn't like white people at all.)Another thing I found bizarre was, well, the number of times the woman is tied up. I think she was tied up more than Wonder Woman was in her first ten issues. (which is to say a lot) Hunter seemed to have a real penchat for sniffing women's undergarments too. (that is what happened to the pantallettes. He stole them to get a good personal sniff) Finally, I am detecting a theme in these romance books. The name of the woman, Loretta, has the meaning \"little wise one\". She doesn't know that at the start of the book but it is implied that she is smart. So smart that she believes absolutely everyone around her except the one guy who never lies to her. She believes her jerk of an uncle that tries to rape her, she believes the cousin of Hunter, who tells her how evil Hunter is and has her convinced that Hunter killed her mother, she believes the other settlers when they say the Comanches are cannibals. But she won't believe that Hunter isn't going to kill her. Even though he never once tries to or shows any indication for it. So all the women are said to be smart but are not. What is with that in these romance books? It does a real disservice to women I think.Pre-listen guess.I bet this sucks."}, {"userName": "KarenH", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2609870-karenh", "userReview": "Comanche Moon is Native American romance at its best. It is a powerful, intense and brutally honest story of two people caught up in the ultimate forbidden love...how they defied decades of history and the steadfast customs of two warring nations to follow their hearts and be together.Hunter of the Wolf is a fierce Comanche warrior who, for good reason, has devoted his life to \"fighting the great fight\" against the white man. However, from birth he has known that he is the \"chosen one\" to fulfill an ancient Indian prophecy that speaks of the promise of peace between the Indians and the whites. Hunter must find the \"golden-haired girl with no sound\" and give her his heart to set the prophecy wheels in motion. Loretta Simpson is that girl. At 20 years old, she lives a nondescript existence on a rural farm in Texas with her aunt, cousin and step-uncle. Traumatized at age 13 when she witnesses the brutal slaughter of her parents by the Comanche, Loretta is mute. Out on a routine scout one day, Hunter sees Loretta and knows without a doubt she is the woman described in the prophecy. Being the Alpha male he is (\"you are my woman so you do what I say\"), Hunter decides Loretta is going with him so he trades 50 horses (all stolen from nearby white neighbors LOL) to her uncle and squires her away. Thus begins Hunter & Loretta's tumultuous relationship. Intense feelings of hatred, mistrust, betrayal and fear eventually give way to opposite feelings, but the brutally realistic (and often graphic) roller coaster of a journey that Hunter & Loretta must take to reach their HEA is the blood and guts of Comanche Moon.You cannot read this book without becoming a part of it; and, whether you have preconceived ideas about life in early western America or you are totally ignorant to history, you will come away from this book not only with a bit of certifiable knowledge about the wild west but with a new respect for the men and women who occupied our land first...who charted the original course through the untamed lands and planted the seeds that would bloom into the wonderful country we enjoy today!"}, {"userName": "Susanna Herrero", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37928787-susanna-herrero", "userReview": "Maravillosa historia!

Me ha gustado mucho los protagonistas, Hunter es un comanche y su pueblo es parte de \u00e9l. Es fiero, valiente, fuerte en la batalla y si mata\u2026y a la vez es dulce y con un gran sentimiento de pertenencia al grupo. Me encanto como cuida a Amy te el coraz\u00f3n. Y qu\u00e9 decir de Loretta, sufre una lucha tit\u00e1nica entre su coraz\u00f3n y su cabeza, con el handicap de ser mujer en una \u00e9poca que las mujeres era menos que un caballo, una persona valiente, tremendamente fuerte, con mucho coraje y con un gran trauma encima.

It\u2019s sort of one of those books that\u2019s just \u201cthere\u201d, an average read with nothing exciting but with things that bugged me more than stood out as \u201cwow that was great\u201d. Anderson\u2019s frontier story started off well enough with the settlers and the Indians at war. There\u2019s your gruesome warfare on both sides, an okay heroine and a hero with potential but it just missed the mark in terms of coming together as a good love story. I found it all to be very long once I hit the three quarter mark and I think the author could have edited out a lot of the filler and narration that didn\u2019t have much to do with the h/h. I have a problem with a hero who can\u2019t really communicate in terms of speech with the heroine, for some reason I just can\u2019t believe the great love story. Hunter could speak a passable English while Loretta couldn\u2019t speak any Comanche so I don\u2019t know why he really wanted her so badly. Her incessant distrust of him was annoying as was her prudishness. I can appreciate a \u201creticent\u201d heroine but at some point she has to let go to show that she loves the hero otherwise it might as well be historical fiction not historical romance. I never got that feeling from Loretta. I could see how she\u2019d be very leery in trusting Hunter given what happened to her mother but at some point she either has to fish or cut bait and I really wish they\u2019d have both called it a day and just gone their separate ways. He was constantly having to justify himself and convince her that what he did was not something heinous like she often thought. It got old. Why did he put up with it? There was too much back and forth You\u2019re mine/I\u2019m not/Yes you are/No I\u2019m not. The story felt repetitious towards the end with heavy narration and useless filler about the wars, the destruction, the hardship etc etc. Even the steam was a nothing to write home about. Absolutely nothing happens really until nearly the end and at over 400 pages of small writing that\u2019s a lot of time to wait. Sure there\u2019s the build up at the beginning but it just keeps building and then stagnates to a point where I didn\u2019t really care when Loretta did finally decide to get her act together. A notable secondary character was Hunter\u2019s cousin Red Buffalo. He was so horrible but at least he was different because the other characters were just cardboard cut-outs from Loretta\u2019s cousin Amy to some of the Indian women who befriended Loretta. Very stereotypical romance characters doing stereotypical things.Considering its length, the author did do a decent job of weaving together a story it just wasn\u2019t one that held my interest right through. I wanted more emotional investment from the h/h and what I got was a general love story with a lot extra info that should\u2019ve been wallpaper but turned out to be nearly main characters themselves. The ending was also too \u201cepic\u201d and again not focused on the h/h. It had that \u201cBrave New World\u201d feel to it, not what I want in a romance novel.So this just makes 4 stars for me. It\u2019s not a bad story but for me it wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d call good either let alone great. It\u2019s the type of read I let out a big sigh of relief and was happy when it was finished so I could move on to something else."}, {"userName": "valee", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2320890-valee", "userReview": "There is so much to say about this book, but I feel like I'm late,because everybody has read it already and rated it as well.Even though everything about this book has been mentioned already, I'll try to keep my review short.This was a wonderful, perfect romantic story.

Of course, as my friend Lady Jayne pointed out, they apparently didn't write them even when this book was published. I cannot imagine what editors were thinking when they asked author Catherine Anderson to change her story if she wanted to sell it, but we should be very grateful that she didn't listen.Most romance readers, like me, will have heard of Comanche Moon even if they haven't read it. It is a classic for a reason - it's good. Very good. Interestingly, I wouldn't necessarily have categorised this as a romance per se. \"Epic Love Story\" seems to be a much more accurate description. Whatever you want to call it, reading it's an experience worth having.Catherine Anderson brings her story to life, portraying with gritty realism the journey of being a white woman ripped away from everything she knows and held captive at the complete mercy of the savage Comanches. There are not endless pages of dull, descriptive narrative, but the setting and characters are vividly rendered with great skill.One of the many strengths of this novel is that the author remained true to the setting and the characters. This was a harsh landscape populated with harsh people (both the whites and the Native Americans) where violence was common place. Nothing is prettied up for the reader, and that makes for a very gripping, immersive, emotional experience.Another strength is the characters. Not just Loretta and Hunter, who in particular is complex and captivating, but also the cast of secondary characters, each of whom were fully realised and added immeasurably to the story.I don't know why I waited so long to read this one, but if you've left it languishing on your TBR like I did, it's time to dig it out and go on this adventure.
