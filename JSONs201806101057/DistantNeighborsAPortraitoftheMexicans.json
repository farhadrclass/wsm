There are good chapters about language and customs.

He seems to know more about Mexico and the Mexicans than myself or any Mexican I know, about all topics and specially about politics. Even though this book was written so long ago, some truths remain.I hope we do take notice to what he is telling us and I too hope we can change for the better...if we really want to change. Otherwise, we will remain as we are. A very strong contender to get out of the \"developing nations status\" but, that somehow; still trying...close, but not there yet.I know we can--all we have to do is work together in the same direction. I want our distant neighbors to be our closest and most wanted neighbors....because it is good for all of us."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17937-kevin", "userReview": "My edition lists this book as from 1984. Even so, it gives a good \"outsider's\" perspective and understanding of Mexican culture and history, managing to mostly avoid taking sides. Chapters start strong, extracting the symbolism behind how a political party \"institutionized\" a \"revolution\" to help avoid the violent transfers of power that often plague Latin America. But towards the end of chapters, the author, a NYT reporter in Mexico during the time of print, makes the common journalist-writing-a-book mistake of rehashing the minutia of what he covered."}, {"userName": "Keith Carr", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21206491-keith-carr", "userReview": "Pretty great. Riding's goal to present a portrait of Mexico from many angles; historical, geographical, anthropological, sociological; in order to contextualize contemporary Mexico for an estadounidense audience which lacks understanding of all of those angles. I think he succeeds. It's succinct, does not limit itself to just fact or myth, and brings together each discipline in a cohesive, logical way that never fails to be interesting. It is dated of course (the contemporary context is the late 80s, so the social stats are not up to date) but as a snapshot of that crucial era, the book provides a great understanding of Mexico as a nascent postmodern state. I read this book for a class on the history of US-Mexican relations. 1985 was truly the last nadir in our relationship until the current one since 2016. So many of our current problems date back to that time of oil, migration, drugs and thugs. To read Mexico contextualized in that time is very much relevant today \u2013 and Riding makes it fascinating."}, {"userName": "MariaDul GV", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50227241-mariadul-gv", "userReview": "As Mexican I'm fascinated the way Riding captured the Mexican essence from an American view. From my personal perspective even that it was written in the 80s the core remains till now days.Distant neighbors was recommended by an American person who is in constant touch with my culture. After some talks about my culture and how accurate he is on his perceptions he suggested me to read it. If you want to understand Mexican culture and live within, Distant Neighbors is an introduction to understand the culture from historical, economical, political and sociological perspective.I found it easy to read even that I'm a non English native speaker."}, {"userName": "~Ivy~ ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/658301-ivy", "userReview": "I learned so much from this book.
