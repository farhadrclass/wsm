I read it off the page when it first came out. Later, I listened to Gaiman's narration of the audiobook when I was sequestered in the north woods of Wisconsin in a desperate attempt to finish book two. I watched the movie and enjoyed it. My most recent experience of the book was listening to it with my little boy on a long car ride. I wasn't sure he'd be able to get into it. Not because of the vocabulary. He's very sharp for being 4.5. He's good with words. But sometimes he gets a little scared. Despite my worries, he seemed to enjoy it. He paid attention, attention, asking for us to turn it back on after we stopped by the side of the road. A day later, he excitedly told me all about the story, apparently forgetting I'd been in the car too. All of that was months ago. Fast forward to now.... * * *\"Dad,\" Oot said. \"Do you know the guy who wrote Coraline?\"The question caught me by surprise. The two of us were driving to a party together, a friend was having a bonfire and I was amazed that he was thinking about anything other than smores.\"I do,\" I said. \"His name is Neil Gaiman.\" \"Do you have his phone number?\" he asked.\"No,\" I said.\"Do you know where he lives?\"\"I do,\" I said.\"Are you his friend?\"That brought me up short. For Oot, that's a simple question. If you meet someone and play with them, they're you're friend. Easy. For adults these things are harder. And it's doubly hard for me these days. My life has changed so much over the last five years, and my previously established metric for friendship doesn't work very well any more. You see, for the majority of my life, a friend was someone who would, say, help me move a couch. Someone you could bum 10 dollars off of if you needed to. A friend was someone who felt comfortable enough to come over to my house without calling first. Then, if I wasn't home, they would let themselves in, eat out of my fridge, and start watching TV. While I'm terribly fond of him, Neil Gaiman has never done any of these things. Then again, neither have any of the other authors I've met over the last few years. I'm painfully aware of the need for new friendship metrics, but I haven't managed to develop a good set yet.That won't make any sense to my boy, but still, I try to be honest with him whenever I can. \"I don't know if we're friends,\" I say. \"But we're colleagues.\"\"What's a colleagues?\" he asks, right on cue. \"That means we know each other and do the same job,\" I explain. \"Oh yes,\" he says. \"You're both authors.\" It makes me proud when he says that. I'm proud that my boy knows I write books. \"Do you know his address?\" Oot asks, and it takes me a while to realize that he's returning to his previous line of questioning. \"I do,\" I said, not bothering to point out that knowing where someone lives and knowing their address is pretty much the same thing.\"Can you send him a letter?\" \"I could,\" I say. Oot pauses for a moment then, and I realize that this has been the point of the whole conversation. He wants to send Neil Gaiman a message. \"What would you like me to write to him?\" I ask. \"You should tell him he *sure* knows how to write a scary story....\"* * *So there you go. You don't really need me to tell you how I feel about one of Gaiman's books at this point. You know I love his writing. Instead, I'm offering up my boy's unvarnished opinion. Did he think the story was scary? Absolutely. But he still wanted us to turn it back on as soon as we were back in the car. What's more, he was still thinking about Coraline months later. And it was the first book where he's ever shown any interest in contacting the author. So. Bravo, Neil Gaiman. You've managed to win over two generations of the Rothfuss household."}, {"userName": "Nataliya", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya", "userReview": "Coraline is a short but delightfully dark and creepy book that just happens to feature one of my absolute favorite characters. \nIs it wrong that I want to be Coraline's best friend???\n  \u201cBecause,' she said, 'when you're scared but you still do it anyway, that's brave.\u201d \n Coraline is clever, quirky, curious and adventurous, brave and determined, independent, stubborn to no end, a bit reckless and not scared of danger. She will NEVER leave any mysterious doors locked and uninvestigated. \n\nIn short, she is what I hope my future (hypothetical) daughter is going to be like.\n\n Out of boredom due to rainy days and parental inattention, Coraline sets out on a scary but awesome adventure. She bites off (almost) more than she can chew, but comes out of it a winner and just a bit more grown-up and mature (but luckily not in a dreadful moralistic way). \n\"Nothing\u2019s changed. You\u2019ll go home. You\u2019ll be bored. You\u2019ll be ignored. No one will listen to you, really listen to you. You\u2019re too clever and too quiet for them to understand. They don\u2019t even get your name right.\"\n The story is intense and sinister, and yet really fun. With his dark fairy-tales Coraline and The Graveyard Book, Gaiman proves that he has mastered the art of writing perfect non-condescending children's books that also appeal to adults. He is not afraid of making a kids' book scary; he knows kids can handle it quite well. The \"Other\" world he creates is eerie and surreal, with a dreamlike quality - the kind of dream from which you wake up screaming. But the story is also full of humor and has the Cat!....... ............I guess I have a weakness for amazing book-cats (it must be the Alice in Wonderland influence on my young pliable mind back in 1980s). I adore the wisdom, independence, and a bit of condescending attitude they give humans.  \"We... we could be friends, you know,\" said Coraline.\"We COULD be rare specimens of an exotic breed of African dancing elephants,\" said the cat. \"But we're not. At least,\" it added cattily, after darting a brief look at Coraline, \"I'M not.\"\n -----------The language of the book is simple and sparing, and fits the story perfectly. Coraline is one of the books that are just meant to be read aloud. Overall, a great story that fully deserves the 5-star rating."}, {"userName": "Jayson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22106879-jayson", "userReview": "(A-) 82% | Very GoodNotes: A genuinely disturbing and creepy story with vivid imagery, it\u2019s well-rounded and goes at a perfect pace and length."}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "Has anyone ever said to you \u201ctime heals all wounds?\u201dWell for the \"villain\" of this story that is clearly not the case. It\u2019s easy to pinpoint Coraline\u2019s bravery and talk about her experience, but that\u2019s not what this review is about. I want to consider the \u201cother mother\u201d and her story. I mean what exactly is her story? We can only presume that she has been doing this kind of trickery for years, perhaps even centuries. We don\u2019t really know a great deal about her. She has three victims prior to her attempts on Coraline. Two appear to be fairly normal children. The third speaks in a form of Shakespearean English, which I took for proof of a victim many years previous. We don\u2019t know a great deal about the actual house either or how long it has actually been standing. The descriptions speak of age. But how much age are we talking? It\u2019s all a little bit of a mystery. What drove this woman to such depravity? What happened in her life that she needed to feed upon the love of children? What has she lost? Where did it all begin? I can only speculate. But one thing remains an absolute certainty to my mind; something terrible happened to the \u201cother mother\u201d a long time ago, something awful that drove her into the deepest depths of despair and as a result she clings to the essence of life: love. The movie adaption gives some brief idea of where she came from; she is Wyborn\u2019s Grandma\u2019s sister. But I\u2019m not sure how much of this we can actually consider. Although the movie was written in collaboration with Gaiman neither of the characters actually appear in the book. So I\u2019m left with even more speculation. What do you think?Is the \u201cother mother\u201d a villain or is she simply a misunderstood victim of fate? Postscript- I wish I had a friend like Coraline whilst growing up.

However, I can say that seeing the film first didn't really spoil the book for me. Coraline starts off rather slowly but this independent, thoughtful, odd, distant, misunderstood child soon gains the reader's sympathy. This becomes more intense as Coraline gets more deeply enmeshed in danger. Gaiman does a good job of characterization. We see the characters through the eyes of a little girl who is remarkably intelligent and yet doesn't understand everything the adults do or say. Many of the adults are eccentric in a Dickensian sort of way; they deal with others when they have to but are firmly ensconced in their own little worlds. And so they see Coraline as an oddity too. The cat is perhaps my favourite character of all. Gaiman knows cats well; they appear elsewhere in his works. And this one is the genuine article: superior, stand-offish, wilful, easily offended, and yet a true friend.Gaiman makes this a children's book that will appeal to adults as well. It doesn't talk down to children. Not everything is spelled out or explained away. We don't really know, for example, who the Other Mother is or where she came from. As the book progresses we get hints, but not a \"back-story.\" And that's just fine--although I have to admit, I'm curious.

'she stole our hearts, and she stole our souls, and she took our lives away, and she left us here, and she forgot about us in the dark.' \nThis is a story about a girl named Coraline Jones, She and her parents move to a new house but they don't own all of the house. They just own part of it and they also have neighbors who live in this big house. They are Miss Spink, Miss Forcible and an old man with big moustache but one day the old man says he has a message for Coraline from the mice. The message is Don't go through the door  and when Coraline visites Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's house, they read Coraline's tea leaves and they say she is in danger. what does the old man mean when he says he has a message from the mice that says Don't go through the door? and what do Miss Spink and Miss Forcible mean when they say she is in danger when they see her tea leaves? what kind of danger is this? you have to read the book to know all the answers. you won't regret it once you start reading it. just go, buy the book and read it. I have always loved watching horror or creepy movies since I was a kid so when I was a kid I watched Coraline movie. I wasn't born as a reader, so I didn't read the book first before watching the movie :( and I loved it so much! I still remember those days when I watched the movie and I felt my heart pounded so hard inside my chest and it was actually one of my favorite movies. I watched it all over again and again and I even watched it again with my best friend and she totally loved it too. So months ago I decided to read the book because I loved the movie when I was a kid and I liked the book so much! it was my first book in 2017. when I started reading this book, I felt so excited because I was in reading slump ( and I'm probably still am) but I got a little bit bored when I was in the beginning maybe I felt a little bit bored because I already knew about the story but it was just  a little bit.  and Coraline was so cute and she was brave, clever and she also loved adventure! I mean, she was just a kid but she was SO brave. what could I do when I was around her age? possibly nothing important. you'll know what I mean if you've read this book, if you haven't then you have to read it. IT WAS SO GOOD! the story was really interesting and I should have read this book sooner! the illustrations in this book are so amazing and they're cute but some of them are scary too, which are SOO AMAZING. I almost always read this book at night and that was the perfect time to read this book. I love that feeling when I feel scared, my eyes barely wink, my breath become fast or when I clutch my hair with one hand and turn the pages very fast ( sometimes I think I'll tear my book when I turn the pages so fast. but I just can't control my emotion). So I suggest you to read this book at night. it's just the perfect time to read this book. I just don't know what to say about this book. this book was great and I enjoyed it even though I got a little bit bored at the beginning. Basically this book was great and If you want a creepy book with interesting story then I recommend you to read this book. thank you so much for reading and liking this review. Hope you all have an amazing day!\u2764\u2764\u2764"}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "This a perfect, traditional fairy* tale, with a slightly surreal twenty-first century warp. The writing is as magical as the plot. Its thirteen chapters are delightful, dark, and funny, with a heroine many can relate to, as child, parent, or both. Coraline is intelligent, inquisitive, slightly contrary, hates being bored, and wishes her parents paid her more attention, and didn\u2019t feed her \u201crecipes\u201d. Perhaps, she wishes she had different parents. And you should always be careful what you wish for, even if you don\u2019t know you\u2019ve wished for it. So begins an adventure in which Coraline unlocks a door, goes down a secret passage, and finds herself in an alternate world that is eerily familiar, and scarily unfamiliar. She must conquer fears, discover the truth, and solve problems to find and rescue her parents, herself, and others. \"A book is not supposed to be a mirror. It's supposed to be a door.\" Fran Lebowitz. There are echoes of Grimm, Lewis Carroll, Roald Dahl, Dickens, Greek myths, and others, but it's also thoroughly original. It is YYA, rather than YA. I only wish it had been published a decade ago, so I could have read when my son was YYA.Learning OutcomesThis isn\u2019t a remotely teachy or preachy book, but Coraline learns a lot about life, familial love, and especially herself. She finds bravery she didn\u2019t know she had, but she faces temptation as well. \u201cThe other mother loved her\u2026 as a dragon loves gold.\u201d The other mother offers her everything she thinks she wants. But there is a price, and Coraline has a Eureka moment, and declares: \u201cI don\u2019t want whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted? Just like that, and it didn\u2019t mean anything?\u201dThe Importance of NamesNames are often endowed with supernatural power, but in this book, it\u2019s almost the reverse. In Coraline\u2019s real world, there is a strange man who has an apartment in the same house; Coraline doesn\u2019t know his name (it hadn\u2019t even occurred to her that he had one), and he always gets hers wrong (Caroline). The equivalent man in the alternative world always gets her name right, and yet that's also where the cat explains why names are unimportant: \u201cWe [cats] know who we are, so we don\u2019t need names.\u201d When Coraline asks what she'd do if she needed to call it, the cat replies, \u201cCalling cats\u2026 tends to be a rather overrated activity. Might as well call a whirlwind.\u201dThe Importance of Fairy TalesIn the introduction, Gaiman says that the prime message he wanted to convey to his young daughters was that bravery is \u201cwhen you\u2019re scared but still do it anyway\u201d.Hence, he opens with a quote from GK Chesterton:\u201cFairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\u201d That reminded me of an equally pertinent one from Ursula Le Guin:\u201cPeople who deny the existence of dragons are often eaten by dragons. From within.\u201d Chris Riddell\u2019s Illustrations Compared with Henry Selick's FilmMy edition of the book is illustrated by Chris Riddell, who has also illustrated Gaiman's The Graveyard Book. I have fond memories of his collaboration with Paul Stewart on The Edge Chronicles, read with my son a dozen years ago, and enjoy his cartoons in The Literary Review. The slightly different imagery of the film is probably familiar to more people. I saw it several years ago, and it feels like a Tim Burton work, but it was actually adapted and directed by Henry Selick, who worked with Burton on The Nightmare Before Christmas, and also directed James and The Giant Peach (Miss Spink and Miss Forcible reminded me of aunts Spiker and Sponge).Submit to being entrapped in this tangled web of creative talent. Quotes\u2022\t\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the kind of rain you could go out in, it was the other kind, the kind that threw itself down from the sky and splashed where it landed. It was rain that meant business.\u201d\u2022\t\u201c'Go away,' he said cheerfully.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cAn argument as old and comfortable as an armchair\u2026 that no one ever really wins or loses.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cThe mist hung like blindness around the house.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cShe had the feeling that the door was looking back at her, which she knew was silly, and knew on a deeper level was somehow true.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cThere was something slightly vague about his face \u2013 like bread dough that has begun to rise.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cHer long white fingers fluttered gently, like a tired butterfly.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cHer hair was wriggling like lazy snakes on a warm day. Her black-button eyes seemed as if they had been freshly polished.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cIf she were nowhere, then she could be anywhere. And, after all, it is always easier to be afraid of something you can\u2019t see.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cHer voice did not just come from her mouth. It came from the mist, and the fog, and the house, and the sky.\u201d\u2022\t\u201cMirrors\u2026 are never to be trusted.\u201dBut Gaiman is. This book is magical.

Refreshingly creepy is maybe the best way to describe this young adult work that also has darker elements, references to myth and the occult that will probably fly over the heads of younger readers. Older readers will find Coraline living down the street from Charles Addams place and also backyard neighbors of Ray Bradbury\u2019s The October Country folks.\u201cThere was a tiny doubt inside her, like a maggot in an apple core.\u201dBut Gaiman\u2019s Coraline never achieves the campy fun of Addams or Bradbury, leaning instead towards a Tim Burtonesque darkness that is charming in its own way. (Though the 2009 film was directed by Burton collaborator Henry Selick).Gaiman masterfully blends haunting elements of nighttime mystery with his own inimitable style of writing, to create a setting for Coraline to explore. Coraline\u2019s plucky little girl, written soberly for a slightly more mature reader, struggles perfectly with the arcane machinations of the other mother.\u201cIt doth not hurt,\u201d whispered one faint voice.Finally, Gaiman\u2019s unique ability to craft a sepulchral niche that is akin to Lovecraft but more playful, reminds the reader of his brilliant work The Graveyard Book.

I didn't expect anything with this book, and that little shiver down my spine that has been evading me? This book gave it to me!I was not a huge fan of American Gods, but I promised that I would give Neil Gaiman another shot someday. I figured if I enjoyed anything of his it would be this book. Despite my gripes with American Gods I couldn't deny that I found Gaiman to be a great storyteller. This book definitely confirms that I was right about that.Coraline is a young girl who loves to explore and finds a locked door in her house. Her mother shows her that there is nothing there by unlocking the door and revealing a brick wall behind the door. However, a while later she tries to open the door again and enters a mysterious passageway that leads her to another house that looks like her own house. She meets a woman who refers to herself as Coraline's \"other mother\". When she returns home from this alternate world she realizes that her parents are gone and she must rescue them. Coraline is tempted into this new world where everything seems better. At her real home she is fighting the computer for her father's attention. She has to choose where to stay, and which life she really wants.This book is only 99 pages on the Nook so I don't really want to give too much away. It's a very quick, but chilling read in my opinion. I loved the dialog between Coraline and all of the other characters, particularly the cat. The creepy graphics added to the eeriness of this book. I feel like this could be a fun book to read with my son around Halloween.I also love how smart Coraline was in the end. She really learned the age old lesson about the grass always being greener. Love this quote: \u201cI don't want whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted just like that, and it didn't mean anything? What then?\u201d Such a wise thing to think coming from a young girl. I don't think Coraline's actual age is ever revealed in this book, but either way she's young enough to make that an impressive statement.I really liked this book, and would recommend it. It's short, cute, fun, and creepy. Don't get me wrong. This book wasn't terrifying or anything like that, but for a children's book I was impressed with how much I actually felt scared for Coraline being all alone in this strange world."}, {"userName": "C.G.

I was in the mood for something freakish and gothic. I got it. (Plus, writing research for middle-grade books. I am a writer, after all.)So between taking notes about style and description and length of MG books, I enjoyed the story immensely. A lot of a lot, okay? It\u2019s written in such a simple way. It probably mentions about 3 or 4 times how Coraline is actually feeling. The rest is fact. This happened, and then that happened, and then here let\u2019s describe the disembodied hand with red fingernails \u2013 okay, then this happened. THAT is epic storytelling. Who can manage to sound freaky and creepy without actually telling the reader to be creeped? Neil Gaiman, apparently. The story line is simple and delicious. It narrates Coraline\u2019s rather boring life in her new apartment (in England too, I like English books a lot) and then goes on to describe what happens when she goes through the door. There\u2019s a talking and sarcastic cat (it almost makes me like cats, and I\u2019m very opposed to the monstrous creatures). There are marbles. There are children without souls locked in closets.

It's a kids' book, but not really a kids' book. It's a fantasy/horror novel, but not a fantasy/horror novel. It has minor similarities to about a hundred books to be found over the ages, both children's and adult, but nothing strong enough to be called an influence (at least, not one that wears its heart on its sleeve). About the best thing I can come up with would be a much darker version of Roald Dahl's Matilda with a leavening of The Secret Garden, a touch or two of Neverwhere, and a dash of Wendy Walker's The Secret Service just for flair. And a large number of flavors running underneath you will sense but not really be able to put your finger on.Coraline is a girl who's pretty much bored with the way things are. While exploring, she discovers that a door in the drawing room, behind which has always been a wall of bricks, now has a tunnel to what she assumes is the flat on the other side. But when she goes through, she finds a weird alternate universe where her parents have buttons for eyes, things are interesting, and the world ends beyond the garden...Gaiman mentions in an interview after the book (found only in the ebook edition) that Coraline is usually seen by children as an adventure story, by adults as a horror novel. Both are correct, of course. It is a lovely rendition of both, told in an almost classical children's-book style (consider the diction in older children's books, from the depression or before, and then consider Coraline) but without ever talking down to its target audience. Coraline is a wonderfully well-drawn character, as are most of the book's creations. There is a great deal to enjoy here; this is easily Gaiman's best aside from American Gods. If you've been avoiding it because you thought it was a kids' book, think again. ****"}, {"userName": "Alex \u2623 Deranged KittyCat \u2623", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13555222-alex-deranged-kittycat", "userReview": "Coraline is my second Neil Gaiman book. Fortunately, the Milk was my first and it didn't impress me much. But this book! I love it. It made me feel many things: frustration, hope, chills etc. I felt like a kid again, listening to a fairy tale.Meet Coraline. She's a girl who feels a little ignored by her parents and seems to have nothing much to do, but just go exploring. She soon finds a door that takes her in a wonderful world where her Other Parents live. They look exactly the same as hers, the only difference being that they have buttons where their eyes should be. The Other Mother is charming, caring and an amazing cook (unlike her real mother - it's her father that does all the cooking). Coraline is asked to stay in this fantasy world. But there's a catch. She has to accept buttons being sewn in place of her eyes. And this is when the nightmare really begins.I am intrigued with the horror part of the story. I'm not sure how it would affect a child. The whole idea of sewing buttons for eyes on a human gives me the creeps. Ewww!After reading the book, I had to see the animation film, too.

Yeah, I know, it\u2019s shameful, but what can we do? Anyway, since I liked the movie, I told myself I was gonna love the book too, thus I added it to my TBR.I had forgotten about it until my recent post about quiet and jumpy horror. I wasn\u2019t sure what books to use for the quiet category, so I asked Evelyn and she mentioned this. Obviously, my intrigue was gonna wake up again. And it did, in fact. One week later, I started this book.For those of you who don\u2019t know the story, I\u2019ll tell you a brief synopsis: There\u2019s a girl who feels her parents ignore her and she desires they pay more attention to her, she finds a secret door that leads to a place that\u2019s identical to her home, with replicas of all the people who live there, but this place seems\u2026better. It\u2019s more fun and she can do all she wants. The difference is everyone here has buttons for eyes, and Coraline\u2019s mother wants her for herself, so things start to get bad.The first thing you will notice about this book is its eerie atmosphere. Evelyn was right when she classified it as quiet horror. It\u2019s creepy, but it\u2019s more of those that slowly escalate on you until you\u2019re terrified.Coraline herself is a great character. She\u2019s brave, adventurous and astute. She actually felt her age (around 12 yo) \u2013 not too naive and not too mature. She was intelligent, and she was not easily fooled.\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re scared but you still do it anyway, that\u2019s brave.\u201dThe cat was another great character. He was so snarky. I was so surprised about the fact that I found myself liking him, because as you well know, I despise cats, but I couldn\u2019t hate him.When reading horror books, there\u2019s a phrase that\u2019s used all the time. This line is: \u201cThis book gave me nightmares.\u201d More often than not, this is an exageration, but when I say this book scared me more than any Stephen King book ever had, I am not lying to you \u2013 it really did. Who likes people with button eyes that eat bettles and disfigurate, huh?It\u2019s interesting to notice too what Neil Gaiman said in a note at the end of the book:I learned when people began to read it, that children experienced as an adventure, but which gave adults nightmares.I\u2019ve been wondering why that happens. Can it be that children see it as a quest for Coraline to save herself and her parents from the clutches of her evil other mother but adults or mature readers as a story in which the figures who are supposed to make us feel safe are so corrupted they scare? Or is it something else entirely?The illustrations were another point in the book\u2019s favour. They captured perfectly the creepiness and they accompanied the best scenes. For example, look at this work:Some goosebumps it gives you, right?Anyway, I\u2019m glad I finally read this book, and I can\u2019t wait to read more macabre things by Neil Gaiman. Now I\u2019ll go sew my eyes shut take better care of myself and be wary of rats and spiders.___________________________________________Pre-review (October 21, 2015)Such a great book.

Presenting an account of a brave soul confronted with the terrors and fears of childhood fantasies becoming true, Neil Gaiman allows us to get involved with his protagonist, a young girl called Coraline, who is anything but fearsome and shy. But most importantly, Coraline is, if you take into account her young age, wise above the standards of her age:\n\n \u201cI don't want whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted just like that, and it didn't mean anything? What then?\u201d\n\nCoraline captured what today's society fails to teach their children: that contentment does not necessarily mean getting all the things you long to have. Her story is a stirring and horrifying one, but also one which opens the eyes for the dangers of longing for something without taking into account how the consequences might be like. In the beginning of this book, Coraline is bored by her entire life, wishing for excitement and adventures to enter her life. When she finds a mysterious door, our protagonist, adventurous as any of our childhood heroes, can't resist to step through it ... and lands in her own house again. Everything seems to be the same ... except it isn't. Her parents seem to be the same ... except they aren't. Coraline seems to be home again ... except she isn't.As soon as you realize that Coraline's parents are wearing buttons instead of eyes, the true horror of the story begins to emerge and drags you along with Coraline into the story and on a twisty ride.This story teaches to behave bravely in a world where being cowardly might cost your life. Neil Gaiman teaches to embrace the things we love and be content with having them rather than wishing for more. And even more, he delivers a story with entertaining and thought-provoking elements alike, combining the genres Fantasy and Horror and allowing those two to encounter each other above the head of young Coraline. The characterizations are top-notch; when do you ever find a book where a cat turns out to become a favorite of yours? (At least it did become a favorite of mine, but so did Coraline herself.)During the course of not even 200 pages, Neil Gaiman incorporates well-known and frequently used themes like stepping through doors into an alternate world, and he did it so well. Some minor flaws aside, \"Coraline\" has so far been my favorite Gaiman novel, and it makes me anticipate his other works even more - if only for the profound quotes which can be discovered throughout the course of your reading experience.\n \u201cWhat's your name,' Coraline asked the cat. 'Look, I'm Coraline. Okay?''Cats don't have names,' it said.'No?' said Coraline.'No,' said the cat. 'Now you people have names. That's because you don't know who you are. We know who we are, so we don't need names.\u201d The cat wrinkled its nose and managed to look unimpressed. \"Calling cats,\" it confided, \"tends to be a rather overrated activity. Might as well call a whirlwind.\"\"But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?\"\"Because,\" she said, \"when you're scared but you still do it anyway, that's brave.\"\n4.5 stars, embedded in a wholehearted recommendation to read this book."}, {"userName": "Beatriz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46560610-beatriz", "userReview": "Reto #10 PopSugar 2017: Un libro con un gato en la portada\nUna grata sorpresa.

But with a little rain she becomes bored--so bored that she begins to count everything blue (153), the windows (21), and the doors (14). And it is the 14th door that--sometimes blocked with a wall of bricks--opens up for Coraline into an entirely alternate universe. Now, if you're thinking fondly of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe or Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you're on the wrong track. Neil Gaiman's Coraline is far darker, far stranger, playing on our deepest fears. And, like Roald Dahl's work, it is delicious.  What's on the other side of the door? A distorted-mirror world, containing presumably everything Coraline has ever dreamed of... people who pronounce her name correctly (not \"Caroline\"), delicious meals (not like her father's overblown \"recipes\"), an unusually pink and green bedroom (not like her dull one), and plenty of horrible (very un-boring) marvels, like a man made out of live rats. The creepiest part, however, is her mirrored parents, her \"other mother\" and her \"other father\"--people who look just like her own parents, but with big, shiny, black button eyes, paper-white skin... and a keen desire to keep her on their side of the door. To make creepy creepier, Coraline has been illustrated masterfully in scritchy, terrifying ink drawings by British mixed-media artist and Sandman cover illustrator Dave McKean. This delightful, funny, haunting, scary as heck, fairy-tale novel is about as fine as they come. Highly recommended.
