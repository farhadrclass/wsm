I wanted to like it. I like zombie fic and the premise of having a pre-historic zombie melt out of a glacier was original. I also thought the cover was good.At first I thought the cheesy writing was because it was aimed at a MG audience, but the swearing quickly showed that this was supposed to be an adult novel.My main issues were that the story was rushed and the character development was irregular. I didn't need to know a lot about characters that were going to die within the next page, but I did want to get to know characters that were going to be with us for awhile. I felt like characters were behaving in ways that weren't consistent and I actually found myself reading bits to my daughter who is a zombie fanatic. I really, really wanted to like this book. I just didn't. I think the premise was good, but there was no follow-through."}, {"userName": "Holden Attradies", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5973016-holden-attradies", "userReview": "I picked this up because I adore zombie lit and I adore Alaska, where I live. I had been warned by, oh just about everyone, that this was a pretty sub-par book and that it was full of typos. Was it? Yeah, it was. But in spite of all it's flaws I ended up enjoying it far more than I thought I would. I think this primarily came from the fact I was so easily able to visually where the events of the book take place, being I have physically stood in pretty much all the specific locations mentioned in the book. I think if I had not lived in Anchorage I would have detested it and probably not finished it. It has a slow, weird start. The ending is a real let down (although maybe just leaving it open for a sequel). The middle was pretty engaging though, but again I doubt it would have been had I not been familiar with the locations where it was happening."}, {"userName": "Felicia A", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1739957-felicia-a", "userReview": "YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

The writing was a little stiff, self-conscious. Characters were not especially engaging and we didn't feel a lot for them. I think the author tried to make them personable but they just didn't have the depth. Zombie action was fairly standard - nothing exceptional, nothing really bad.

It was very fast paced and the author kept it ( imo) realistic. Even though the zombie \"infection\" in the book happened current day ( as described in several parts of the book) some of the characters have seen zombie movies so they are not completely blind or dumb.Other part in book that I like was that the characters in the book didnt automatcially \"know\" to shoot zombie in the head. Mistakes were made (deadly) mistakes that cost lives because of it.. but gradually throughout the book the characters were realizing that like the movie the zombies did have to be targeted in the head for them not to get back up.

Pochi quelli che seguiamo fino alla fine, un insieme di clich\u00e9 che colpiscono poco e riescono pure ad infastidire.Da quel che ho letto in giro, la descrizione dell'ambientazione \u00e8 perfetta ma, se non si conosce Anchorage, si perde met\u00e0 del divertimento. Non un punto a sfavore ma, per i non locali, neppure positivo.L'epidemia in s\u00e9 parte bene. Originale che il paziente zero sia un cadavere appena scongelatosi da un ghiacciaio... ma la velocit\u00e0 con cui il contagio si trasmette \u00e8 troppo veloce e, a seconda delle necessit\u00e0 di trama, troppo variabile.Non mi \u00e8 piaciuto che uno dei primi personaggi introdotti, un adolescente in piena crisi ormonale, sia stato abbandonato al suo destino (e con uno zombie mezzo scongelato su cui nutre sentimenti di vendetta), soprattutto considerando le possibili ripercussioni.In circa 24 ore, non si riesce a seguire lo scorrere del tempo, la citt\u00e0 di Anchorage \u00e8 zombificata... e non una volta qualcuno (anche il narratore onniscente sarebbe andato bene) pensa a quello zombie mezzo scongelato, libero di fare altrettanti danni nel resto dello Stato.Il finale \u00e8 un altro punto negativo.Quando, come sempre, per i protagonisti arriva il momento di lasciare il posto sicuro... l'epilogo ci avvisa che nel secondo episodio scopriremo cosa \u00e8 accaduto.Se lo stile fosse stato meno approssimativo, se i personaggi fossero stati in grado di trasmettere qualcosa, se non si fosse trattato solo di uno scarso nuovo primo capitolo di una nuova saga, forse la curiosit\u00e0 di proseguire poteva essere in qualche modo stuzzicata.Ma, visto l'effetto globale dato dalla lettura, se Amazon non metter\u00e0 il secondo capitolo in offerta a 0.00 euro dubito che proseguir\u00f2."}, {"userName": "Sarah Stanley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58225002-sarah-stanley", "userReview": "Not a great book. But highly entertaining to read about a zombie apocalypse in your home town..."}, {"userName": "J.R.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7586367-j-r", "userReview": "This is one of the few books in the genre that place the outbreak in Alaska. For most people, when they hear Alaska they unconsciously think that it\u2019s always snow and cold. True, there are places in Alaska where snow stays year round but for the most part the state has sun, rain and even times when snow doesn\u2019t cover the ground. Keeping that in mind, Infection- Alaskan Undead Apocalypse follows the story of an eclectic group of survivors. We have children, doctors, officer workers and retail store managers to name a few.The novel starts out mild and lulls the reader into a sense of complacency with a family vacation to Alaska. There\u2019s the Houser family, Alec the older brother, Martin the middle brother and Julie the sister along with mom and dad Houser, and Martin\u2019s friend, Danny Mahoney, all together to spend a nice vacation getaway in the wilds of Alaska. Picture and experience the melancholy feeling of hearing birds chirping, seeing fish jumping in the stream and deer and elk grazing in yonder meadow.Then, as it must happen, the shit hits the fan when Martin, Danny and Jules find something that might have been encased inside a glacier but now is partially thawed out in the spring weather. This made me think back to the bodies that were shipped to Alaska following the Influenza outbreak in 1918.Martin is unlucky enough to be bitten by whatever it is facilitating a mad race to the hospital. Martin\u2019s condition worsens until he dies. Or does he? He become reanimated and attacks people in the hospital spreading whatever he was exposed to around for all to share. Give the gift that keeps on giving. The outbreak spills out from the hospital and we\u2019re introduced to Neil Spencer, an office worker in a building a short distance from the hospital. Neil is the kind of guy who shows up early at work to start the coffee and have those few precious moments alone before the rest of the staff shows up. This morning, he\u2019s witness to the erupting chaos caused by Martin and his biting frenzy.Rescuing a fellow worker, Neil decides that retreat is the better part of valor for we all know that he who runs away lives to fight another day. Neil and Rachel, the rescued worker, head to Fred Meyer's to stock up and then head for a safe location if there truly is one. It\u2019s at Fred\u2019s that they run into Meghan, the store manager who upon hearing the shit storm that is happening outside, helps them stock up and then joins their merry little band of survivors along with Danny, Jules and Jerry who have escaped the horror of the hospital now turned charnel house.Thus that\u2019s how Infection-Alaskan Undead Apocalypse continues. Unlike other works in this genre, there are no high-speed, highly trained soldiers that appear to save the day. It is utter chaos and well played by Sean Schubert.The reader is thrown into the overall helplessness of an outbreak caused by a small child. An outbreak that occurs in a facility that is relatively safe, a place one would go for help not horror. From there the story spins off into separate plots as groups of survivors attempt to get out of the city and seek refuge somewhere far away from the undead horde. One other nice twist is the authority figure that becomes mentally unstable. Kudos for that one as not everyone can handle that kind of stressful situation no matter how well trained they may be.Two minor issues and I do mean minor. There is a mention of Blackhawk gunships. OK I can see that. The reference is to the UH60 Blackhawk helicopter used by the military. Sure you can arm them with door guns making them armed troop transports but they don\u2019t really fit into the category of gunship unless you\u2019re referring to the BattleHawk which is a dedicated weapons platform.The other item is pulling back the hammer on the machine gun. In this context it\u2019s a vehicle mounted heavy machine gun and they, unlike handguns, do not have a hammer to pull back. They have a charging handle on the side that chambers the first round in the linked belt. Again, these are minor issues I just wanted to bring them to the attention of the author so that they are aware of this. By no means do these issues detract from the overall reading enjoyment, it\u2019s just me being anal about technical details regarding military equipment, vehicles and weapons.I found Infection-Alaskan Undead Apocalypse to be a very entertaining read and look forward to the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Infection: Alaskan Undead Apocalypse takes place mainly in Anchorage, and begins with a family of tourists from Minnesota who are traveling to Alaska on vacation. The younger boy, Martin, has brought along a friend, Danny, and the family plans on spending time out in the woods at a cabin near a glacier. Almost immediately upon arrival at the cabin, Martin, his sister Jules, and Danny discover what appears to be a dead body stuck in the melting glacier. Thinking it is a caveman, they pose next to it, taking pictures. When the caveman turns out to be a thawed zombie, and Martin gets bitten, the family races back to Anchorage to a hospital as Martin\u2019s health rapidly deteriorates. All hell breaks loose when the boy ends up dying in the hospital, gets back up, and attacks everyone around him. Things rapidly spin out of control from there, with a plague of undead spilling outside the walls of the hospital and onto the streets of Anchorage. Within a matter of hours, the entire city is under siege by a horde of fast moving undead devouring and infecting everyone in their path. Throughout the course of this book, the first in a planned trilogy, we are introduced to the people that make up two main groups of survivors. One group is led by Dr. Caldwell, who was treating Martin at the hospital, and the other lead by Neil, an office worker who witnesses one of the first zombie attacks outside of the hospital (and the two surviving children-Jules and Danny-end up with him as well). The pages telling the story of these characters are intermingled with various graphic scenes of carnage as Anchorage is ripped to shreds and the police and military are unable to do much to stop the tide of death rushing over them. Infection: Alaskan Undead Apocalypse is a fun, fast-paced tale of zombie mayhem that barely gives you time to breath, and zombie fans who crave plenty of gore and undead action should enjoy it. The main characters are well developed and give the reader a few folks to root for as well as one in particular to loathe, which keeps things interesting from start to finish. As I always try to do, I point out areas of concern with a story, and I have a couple of them with Infection. The first is a minor point, but one that I feel deserves mentioning. Alaska appears in the title of the book, and as such, I expected this story to bring some unique elements to the table based on the locale. Unfortunately, while the author knows Anchorage like the back of his hand, the city felt no different than any other place on the map. Perhaps the sequels will insert more of the distinctive \u2018flavor\u2019 of Alaska in them that will make this story stand out more.My second issue has to do with one particular character, a police officer. I felt that he would have been far more intriguing character if he wasn\u2019t a cop, but I found it hard to buy into him being an officer of the law. From the beginning, he makes no effort to take a leadership role in a crisis situation, letting Dr. Caldwell handle that role in a non-medical crisis. All I know is that if I were trying to flee from the impending apocalypse and I was in a group with a police officer, I would be looking to him for direction, not a doctor (even as you are racing down the halls of a hospital). But strangely enough, no one calls him on this until well into the book, and by then, I was wondering how this guy ever passed whatever psychological test is required to become an Anchorage cop in the first place. Again, he would have been a far more interesting character were he not a cop. Overall, I felt that this story has the potential to be a solid zombie trilogy. Infection doesn\u2019t really bring anything new to the table-there are no big surprises to be had for zombie fans here-but my hope is that the author turns things up a notch in the sequels to give this story a flavor of the northlands that leaves a lasting impression."}, {"userName": "Badseedgirl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20662786-badseedgirl", "userReview": "Anyone who has ever looked at my reading list will know that I have a love hate relationship with the genre of Zombie fiction. When it is good, it can be a well written and entertaining. But so often in these days of self and e-published novels that should have never seen the light of day, picking up a \u201cZombie novel\u201d should come with Vegas odds as to how bad it will be. Fortunately for every double zero that comes up on the wheel, I will also find a novel like Infection: Alaskan Undead Apocalypse by Sean Schubert, while if not one of the best zombie novels I have ever read, is at least near the top of the middle of the pack.To be honest, I never had much hope for this novel, with expectations that low; Sean Schubert would have had to have written complete crap to have met my expectations. And that was because of the title; or more specifically the subtitle, \u201cAlaskan Undead Apocalypse.\u201d To be honest I was expecting some kind of piss poor rip off of Kurt Russell\u2019s classic movie \u201cThe Thing.\u201d The novel started out meeting my low expectations. Three small children while on vacation in the woods of Alaska find what they think is a caveman frozen in a glacier. While posing next to it, one of the children was bitten because, Surprise!! It was a zombie encased in that ice. And here is where I started to be pleasantly surprised by Infection; I suddenly realized that this was actually a very well written novel. I felt sorry for the characters, and what was about to happen to them. This was not a novel of Alaskan survivalist thriving in the zombie outbreak, but was a story of average people struggling to survive. We see characters surprisingly rise to the challenge and others collapsing under the pressure.My only real disappointment for me was the ending. I know that this is the first novel in a series, but the ending of this first novel felt less like a cliff hanger and more like the author had written a much larger novel and just decided to cut it in half. I guess the word that best describes it would be abrupt. The ending was too abrupt. Still I plan to go another round with this author."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5632782-justin", "userReview": "Previously self-published and now reissued by Permuted Press, Infection: Alaskan Undead Apocalypse is the first book in a projected series by author Sean Schubert. The book starts when three children on vacation in Alaska discover a mostly-frozen man in the woods. They believe it's a preserved caveman corpse...until it takes a bite out of one of them. The victim is rushed to a local hospital, where you can guess what happens next. One bite leads to another and soon the whole town is in full-on zombie apocalypse mode.Zombie 411: Schubert's zombies are more or less the Romero-style undead. They're quicker, but the basic rules seem to apply.The good - Aside from what I normally expect to see done well with this kind of book (namely a brisk pace and well-choreographed violence), Schubert also did a great job introducing his characters. He provided some background and insight into each character - even the ones with less than a page to live - and did it in a way that wasn't awkward or forced, which is not an easy thing to do. The dialogue was solid and (mostly) believable as well.The not so good - While I don't have any issues with the characters or overall execution, the fact is Infection reads like just about every other zombie book out there. The infection hits, people panic, the army and police are useless, only one person in the whole town has ever seen a zombie movie, isolated survivors soon form a group, and then it abruptly ends. The only box that isn't checked is first person narration or a journal entry format. The only real distinction I see is the setting, and even that didn't seem to play much of a role in the story.Infection: Alaskan Undead Apocalypse is a solid enough story, but there's just nothing here that sets it apart from a very crowded pack. If you're a major fan of all things zombie it's worth reading, but it's not a story that will stay with you the way World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War or Ex-Heroes do."}, {"userName": "Brad T.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3634478-brad-t", "userReview": "I read a lot of independent apocalyptic fiction and I have come to expect certain things. Things like editing and writing experience come into play but I don't expect 5 star fiction in this genre. I look for two things: originality and good characters.Originality - The only thing about this book that was original was the setting, you don't see a lot in this genre written about Alaska. I was disappointed to discover though that this could have been set in any city. The fact that it was Alaska seemed really unimportant in this book. It could have been Denver, Colorado and it would have been the same story. Characters - The book featured a lot of cliched characters. There always has to be a cop but I liked that this one was bat shit crazy. Kids without parents - check; gay guy - check; girl in love with gay guy - check; guy who hasn't had the best luck in life turns out to be the hero - check, hot girl who likes him despite his self loathing - check.If I were a first time reader to the genre, I would have probably really liked this book. I didn't dislike the book and I will read the second book in the series for no other reason than I really hope that the Alaskan setting plays more of a role in the book.
