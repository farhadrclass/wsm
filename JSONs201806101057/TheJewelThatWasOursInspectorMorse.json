A rare and historically valuable jewel had come into the possession of her late husband. It was his wish that that the jewel be donated to a museum in Oxford and, in the company of her new husband, the woman has carried the jewel to Great Britain to deliver it herself. However, the night before she is to donate the gift, she dies of an apparent heart attack and her purse containing the jewel is stolen.This would hardly seem to merit the attention of Chief Inspector Morse; after all, there is no homicide involved and he's not about to waste his time investigating a simple theft. But after determining that the lady did, indeed, die of natural causes, Morse can't help but think that something very odd is going on here.When another person associated with the tour is found dead, it clearly is a homicide and Morse and his faithful sergeant, Lewis, are on the job. As is always the case when Morse confronts a killing, the puzzle is very complex and it's going to take a very keen mind to sort this one out. But, of course, as readers of this series know full well, Morse has exactly that sort of mind, and, as always, it's fun to watch him sort through the issues and the characters involved until he's satisfied that things have properly fallen into place.This is another of those intricate English mysteries that could never occur in real life. But it's entertaining to suspend disbelief and watch Morse work his magic once again. This is a book that will appeal to lots of those who love traditional British mysteries."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-jean", "userReview": "[ of revenge.

The structure is reminiscent of an Agatha Christie whodunit, but with infinitely more complications and of course the atmospheric tone of the historic university town of Oxford. Dexter's detective is the curmudgeonly Inspector Morse whose pockets are somehow always empty when the bar tab comes around, to be paid by his long-suffering assistant, Sgt. Lewis. Morris' idiosyncrasies include a far too keen appetite for Glenfiddich single malt scotch, a passionate appreciation of classical music, and an apparently flawless command of the Classics, an oddly reassuring quirk that endears this character to the author's followers.At the heart of this particular mystery is one of the Ashmolean Museum's most revered treasures, the Alfred Jewel. It is a masterpiece of Anglo-Saxon craftsmanship and bears the inscription: AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made'). A fictional counterpart, the Wolvercote Tongue, is to be reunited with the Alfred piece in a highly publicized ceremony. Laura Stratton, widow of an American collector will make the presentation. Laura and her husband Eddie are part of a well-heeled exclusive group of Americans shepherded by John Ashenden on the \u201cHistoric Cities of England\u201d tour which will pass through Oxford. No sooner than their arrival, however, Laura is found dead in her hotel suite, and the Tongue, which she kept at all times in her purse, is missing. Murder? That hypothesis is dashed by the medical examiner \u2014 two of them, in fact. Laura died of a massive heart attack. Was the heart attack connected to the theft? But why would anyone steal the Tongue? It is so recognizable it would be impossible to fence. Did a theft even occur? But surely Dr. Theodore Kemp, whose professional future was linked to this important new Ashmolean acquisition would have seen and inspected the item multiple times during the course of his research. And really, why is everyone, even those with verifiable alibis, lying to Inspector Morse?With a notebook at my side and a re-reading of the first two sections of the book, I was still stumped. My advice? Just sit back and enjoy the tour. Dexter provides a convenient map of Oxford's streets and colleges. Tracing the numerous excursions of the characters over the two day period of their stay will heighten the sense of being there. Cedric Downes, one of the academic docents and a colleague of Dr. Kemp's, will point out that Magdalen St. is pronounced \u201cMaudlin Street,\u201d while Magdalen Road is pronounced just as it is written. As for the famous \u201cEnglish Breakfast,\u201d (one of the high points of my bed and breakfast stays when I was young),  \u201cFew English families living in England have much direct contact with the English Breakfast. It is therefore fortunate that such an endangered institution is perpetuated by the kitchen staff in guest houses, B & Bs, transport caf\u00e9s, and other no-starred and variously starred hotels. This breakfast comprises (at its best): a milkily-opaqued fried egg; two rashers of non-brittle, rindless bacon; a tomato grilled to a point where the core is no longer a hard white nodule to be operated upon by the knife; a sturdy sausage, deeply and evenly browned; and a slice of fried bread, golden-brown, and only just crisp, with sufficient fat not excessively to dismay any meddlesome dietician.\u201d (p.67) Of course the characters, whittled down to about a dozen significant players, are described with a similar ironic reserve. Dexter lavishes particular ire on Kemp. A lisp heightens his impression of affectation. The man is self-preening, lazy and a serial womanizer with more regard for his rain-soaked shoes than the damage he may have caused to the woman he has just visited.This was a satisfying mystery with a connecting trail of crimes.

Okay, \"Arksford\" is mildly entertaining, but do we need to be told that someone says \"vay-cation\" or pronounces Shirley as \"Shurley\"? Naturally, if you are English and don't live on a council estate, you never drop or slur any letters - but watch out, as soon as you go on the dole, you will never again speak an \"-ing\" word properly.Another annoying element I only really picked up on because I just read another book by him,  The Daughters of Cain, is his tendency to re-use elements. Ones I noticed included the description of a woman's \"breast, stomach, thighs\" as \"over-ripe\", and the reuse of a couple of the epigrams that head each chapter, including a quote from \"The Rubaiyat\" that also appeared in  The Daughters of Cain, another quote I am almost certain also appeared there (but I can't check, since it's gone back to the library), and the reuse of the \"the wench is dead\" quotation from, surprisingly enough, his book  The Wench Is Dead. I had always been mildly impressed by his inclusion of a more-or-less apposite reference for the chapters, but am less so now I have realised that he recycles them. Okay, it's a fairly minor quibble, but it jars a bit.The plot is decent enough although its convolutions get a little tiresome at points and it suffers from the perennial problem of mystery books - if there's still a hefty chunk of pages to go, you know that whoever they have just arrested and are sure dunnit is going to be the wrong person, because otherwise there's nothing interesting enough about them being guilty to fill 50-odd pages.And do you think there are far too many references to Morse never paying for drinks..?"}, {"userName": "Charlotte (Buried in Books)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1665215-charlotte-buried-in-books", "userReview": "After the slight disappointment of The Wench Is Dead, this was something of a return to form for Morse. Still drinking far too much and also managing to get his hands on a woman (with the use of possibly the worst chat up line ever - about knickers being taken down and given in evidence). This mystery was full of red-herrings.A group of American Tourists travelling around England arrive in Oxford, one of the them is due to present a precious jewel to a local museum, but before she can do it the jewel is stolen and the woman is dead. The next day the man due to receive the jewel on behalf of the museum is also dead. So was it murder? Will the missing jewel ever be found.This is a crime that only someone like Morse could get to grips with. It was so very, very clever and so very, very sad. Once you understood the background to Dr Kemp, a thoroughly unlikeable man who had crippled his wife and killed another woman in a car accident I can't say that I was that sorry he was dead.It reminded me a little bit of strangers on a train - with one side agreeing to perform the theft if the other helps do away with a very unpleasant man.

While I read I could see and hear John Thaw and Kevin Whateley most clearly. I enjoyed that series and I enjoyed this book until I got toward the end. I must admit that as the solution began to roll out I did want to do something violent to Colin Dexter for drawing it out so long and confusedly. The characters were well drawn, but I wonder at his portrayal of the California accent, which he shows as having a lot more R sound than I think there is: Barth for Bath, for example and Arksford for Oxford. Still, I'm no linguist and could easily be proven wrong. Reading the letters Dexter puts into the book in handwriting, different styles of handwriting, too, was good. I caught most of the errors but realise I don't spell gradient correctly. I enjoyed the word play in which Dexter indulges occasionally, in which the prefixes of a word match the action. I can't remember a real one but an example of the type would be inspire, respire, and expire with a person inspiring another to respire but causing another to expire.As I say, things were rolling along quite nicely until Morse is given a speech to explain roughly what happened but then has to have conversations with others in order to finally give us the answer."}, {"userName": "Bruce Beckham", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28623020-bruce-beckham", "userReview": "In general I found this novel reasonably enjoyable, though reading it again after some years, I would probably give it about five out of ten.On the plus side it is another sojourn into the world of Morse and Lewis, although their relationship is becoming infiltrated by clich\u00e9s that originated in the TV series.There\u2019s a rather pompous narrator who knows the thoughts of the characters, but only reveals them selectively \u2013 a flaw that strains the credibility of the solving of the case.There are many characters, events, times and places \u2013 it would require detailed note-taking or a photographic memory for the reader to unravel the crime.

But this is a Morse mystery, so you know that there is much more going on that meets the eye. As usual Morse gets off track immediately once he figures out that something is amiss and we try to follow his logic as he moves toward the answer. Colin Dexter's book are such fun to read and can be rather educational when Morse gets on a roll regarding literature, music, et al. I watched the television series before I read the books, so I can see John Thaw as a more attractive Morse than Dexter describes him in print.

The jewel of the title is a famous artifact that was bequeathed to the Ashmolean Museum by its owner. The woman carrying the jewel dies and her purse containing it disappears. Morse and Lewis work through a list of suspects displaying varying motives, alibis, and lies.This was a good mystery with quite a bit to puzzle through, but I would say this was not my favorite Morse in the series. There is a different feel, as in author\u2019s voice, to this book than the other Morse novels I have read so far. I think this has to do with the development of this particular book.

Riesce perfettamente a fondere la componente classica del giallo deduttivo al poliziesco d'azione. Docente di greco all'universit\u00e0 e specialista in enigmistica, Colin Dexter mette tutte le sue conoscenze nei romanzi della serie del detective Morse, diventando famoso, prima in Inghilterra e poi nel resto del mondo, anche grazie alla fortunata serie televisiva inspirata alle indagini. Dexter trascina il lettore in una giostra di indagini, ciascuna con raccolta di indizi, analisi, profilo del sospettato, ricostruzione del passato, trama del crimine e colpo di scena catastrofico. Seguire il personaggio di Morse nella sua attenta analisi della scena del crimine, dei tanti dettagli, che, attraverso deduzione e colpi di scena si trasformano in illuminazione finale \u00e8 il massimo che un lettore appassionato di questo genere possa chiedere. Anche il metodo narrativo \u00e8 geniale e attento nel dosare suspense e colpi di scena. Inoltre, l\u2019ironia del narratore rappresenta quel tocco in pi\u00f9 che delinea, arricchendo di sfaccettature, i vari personaggi che affollano la trama e ruotano intorno all'indagine.In questo caso, IL GIOIELLO CHE ERA NOSTRO, a sparire \u00e8 un antico gioiello, il Puntale di Wolvercote, che un\u2019ereditiera americana vuole donare a un museo di Oxford.

Poco dopo il furto, la proprietaria muore d'infarto e il curatore delle antichit\u00e0 anglosassoni del museo, il professor Theodore Kemp, viene assassinato. C'\u00e8 sempre qualcosa che pu\u00f2 accadere. Morse lo sa e indaga al fine di prevedere l'imprevedibile, mettendo ogni tassello al suo posto, per svelare la giusta concatenazione degli eventi.

Colin Dexter's name comes up as the creator behind these excellent detective stories and so I searched for him in my local library. I hoped to start at the beginning, but the series is a bit old and so I made do with starting at book #9.Like Endeavour, The Jewel That Was Ours starts with short chapters/scenes of several different characters with no seeming relation to one another. As the book develops, like the T.V. episodes, the connection between these characters slowly comes into focus. However, unlike watching the episode, it takes longer and is more difficult to keep track of names and stories. Perhaps I have a poor memory, but I found this difficult in the book. However, I understand that confusion is the mystery writer's friend.The Inspector Morse of The Jewel That Was Ours is entertaining and endearing with his curmudgeonly, hard-drinking, obsessive nature. I could see some similarities between him and the young Morse in Endeavour. His head is quickly turned by a pretty woman, which seems to be his blind spot much of the time. He forgets to eat and sleep and often makes a large error in solving the crime, which he overcomes and then properly unravels.I enjoyed this look into the book behind the T.V. show, but I'm not in a hurry to read any more.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the pacing or the writing style, but they seem to plod along. I gave up on Elizabeth George because her books felt like they went on forever yet never moved forward.There are exceptions. I like Deborah Crombie\u2019s books very much. They don\u2019t seem to drag on as much as books by other authors.When I started reading this Colin Dexter book, I hoped it would be more like Crombie\u2019s and less like George\u2019s. Alas, it was not.Like a politician so in love with the sound of his voice he doesn\u2019t know when to shut up, Dexter is so in love with his prose that he doesn\u2019t know when to stop writing. It takes him 347 pages to tell a tale that could have been told in 150.Dexter writes as if it\u2019s 1891 instead of 1991 and gives new meaning to the word tedious. The first five chapters are backstory and stage setting so dull, I was highly tempted to give up on this book. Ninety percent of what\u2019s on those thirty pages could have been distributed throughout the book and been just as informative and a hundred percent less boring.Morse doesn\u2019t come on-stage until Chapter Six, way too late for the star of the show to appear. Does that end the detailed backstories? No. Dexter keeps them coming, filling pages with more banal information about each character than any reader wants or needs to know.Dexter feels the need to describe everything \u2013 the scenery, an office, the path to a hotel room \u2013 in excruciating detail. Do we really need every item in an office listed for us? Or can we figure out what might be there on our own?Dexter never says anything once when he can say it three times and he says everything three times.Dexter also throws a lot of big words around, as if trying to impress us with the extent of his vocabulary (or show us he owns a thesaurus). Using \u2018dolichocephalic\u2019 instead of \u2018long headed\u2019 is just one example. A descriptive word should make the image crystal clear, not send the reader hunting a dictionary. And Dexter never uses 5 words when he can use 8 (\u2018the clarity of her articulation beginning to disintegrate\u2019 instead of \u2018starting to slur her words\u2019). A descriptive phrase should not cause the reader to pause while he translates it into simpler words.Dexter\u2019s writing reads like a doddering old college professor\u2019s lecture. He can\u2019t keep on track, laces it heavily with asides, repetition, and other useless bits and, in the process, thoroughly loses the people trying to follow what he\u2019s saying. Some of Dexter\u2019s sentences are so convoluted that it takes three or four readings to \u2018get\u2019 them, only to realize that he\u2019s used a hundred words to express an idea that could have been said in ten.The bottom line here is a book so boring, it could put a meth addict to sleep."}, {"userName": "John Jenkins", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33300804-john-jenkins", "userReview": "\u201cThe Jewel That Was Ours\u201d is an enjoyable Colin Dexter murder mystery featuring Inspector Morse.

Of course, there are many other possible clues that temporarily distract the Inspector, and probably the reader as well; so the conclusion will be a satisfying surprise to most readers.The book is very readable, but Mr. Dexter\u2019s use of parentheses is excessive.

While he doesn't let the actors' portrayals influence his characters (except that the Lancia is now replaced by the Jaguar), the plot is a little stagnant in the beginning with a lot of exposition for a bunch of characters, so it does lack the usual focus of the previous novels. By the middle of the book, the plot has picked up and we see Morse start putting the jigsaw puzzle pieces together with his usual meditative skill. I had guessed the murderer and the motivation at the midpoint, but there are so many details and surprises, so that guess didn't disrupt the pleasure of reading this mystery. Also, I understand that the ending in the novel is different than in the television episode which also had a different title, \"The Wolvercote Tongue,\" but I've watched the series too long ago to remember. This novel largely takes place in downtown Oxford, where I spent a lot of time, so it was an added joy of nostalgia for me."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22525656-susan", "userReview": "A shrewd, astute, intelligent and A Level whodunit case. Inspector Morse and Sergeant Lewis work well together as they are now a team. A group of septuagenarian Americans from California book a tour while residing in Oxford's most famous luxury Randolph Hotel. One of the guest has a priceless museum piece, the Wolvercote Tongue, her late husband has bequeathed to the Ashmolean Museum. From the time of their arrival, the museum piece goes missing and two people die. The bonus in reading this series is the plethora of classical music Inspector Morse listens to every private moment he has, the extracts of famous quotes the author places at the beginning of each chapter, and the undeniable love Colin Dexter has for Oxford , England. As I close , I am listening to Edith Piaf sing, ' Je ne regrette rien.'."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7916764-carolyn", "userReview": "This is the first actual book of Colin Dexter's that I have read. Having watched the complete TV series of Morse, then Lewis, and now Endeavor and having visited Oxford twice, I am totally enthralled with Morse and his colleagues and the Oxford murder scene and am even more delighted with the places and descriptions of sites in the book since I have actually seen them. The episode of TV's Morse based on this book was entitled the \"Wolvercote Tongue\" and I clearly remembered the opening scene on the bus, and the scenes at the hotel and at The Trout. As they are available from the library I will continue to make my way through the texts and possibly even look again at some of the TV episodes. It's quite the grand experience."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9392635-michael", "userReview": "As I read the 'Inspector Morse' series, it is nice to find that Colin Dexter changes his story telling with each installment. In 'The Jewel That Was Ours' one can read the solution to the entire mystery in the last few chapters. A complete explanation is given. However, one would miss being in the company of Inspector Morse and Sergeant Lewis as they amass the facts for the last few chapters. And this shortcut would cheat the reader of the fact that Morse 'gets lucky' in more ways than just detecting."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32539515-susan", "userReview": "I have read all the Morse books in order up to this and I have to say I found it a bit slow and wordy. I know Oxford well (our daughter was at Uni there) and it is one of my favourite places. So I particularly enjoy the description of where the characters are in the city. But that was not enough to keep my interest in this one - and it felt like the character of Morse was rather jaded with this case - just didn't feel it had the 'energy' of previous books. But that said it was still a good read with an interesting assortment of characters"}], "description": "Fawcett starts to publish beloved sleuth Inspector Morse in just the right month--the new hardcover, The Way Through the Woods, is coming out and the PBS TV \"Mystery\" series is starting.
