I thought the poems were marvelous - sometimes collage-like, sometimes funny and spot on, and often ended with a brilliant last line, such as \"When I looked again, the clouds were just where I left them.\" (\"Meanwhile at the Lava Flow\")or \"It was a matter of time / like chopping is a matter of axes.\" (\"Much Later\")or\"the four a.m. sadness beds down in its own fur.\" (At the Heart of it Was a Quantum Event\")The poems are all pretty short, some just five or six lines long. I don't think any of the poems in here are available online. I did find this (not from this chapbook) on Verse Daily: http://www.versedaily.org/2008/robins...and this - http://www.wmich.edu/newissues/titles...from a review of a full-length book of Samyn's, which I'll likely order."}], "description": "", "title": "The Boom of a Small Cannon", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12161035-the-boom-of-a-small-cannon", "average": 4.6, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390166100l/12161035.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/224170.Mary_Ann_Samyn", "name": "Mary Ann Samyn"}], "type": ["Poetry", "Female Authors"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12161035-the-boom-of-a-small-cannon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394829.Purr", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394828.Inside_the_Yellow_Dress", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6809145-beauty-breaks-in", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/394830.Captivity_Narrative", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16286545-my-life-in-heaven"]}
