Would it be even nicer if it was written from a Christian perspective? In Game Plan for Life by Joe Gibbs, he has written a book for men outlining the guiding principles he has used thoughout his life. With a team of experts, he has uncovered the 11 most important issues facing men today and addresses them in this book including \"Who is God?,\" \"Finances,\" \"Relationships and Sex,\" \"Overcoming Sin and Addiction,\" and more. As he introduces each topic, Joe shares stories of his life and athletes he has mentored. Many of these are situations that we all can relate to. Then, as an added bonus, he introduces his team of \"knowledgable experts\" on the topics addressed in the book. Josh McDowell discusses \"The Bible:Can I beilieve it?\" Ron Blue sheds light on our finances and how best to use them for God's kingdom and our daily lives. Other men who share insights are Randy Alcorn, Ravi Zacharias, and Dr. Walt Larimore.With the sports' theme running through the book, many men will share memories and experiences with the author. As some of the parts are drier than other, the overall information is well delivered and easy to incorporate into everyday life.My rating 4 out of 5 starsTyndale House Publishers has provided you with a complimentary copy of this book for review."}, {"userName": "Dwayne Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5919273-dwayne-smith", "userReview": "Great book and a must read for every believer. The connection the book has to the website with updates to the chapters is excellent. The staff that Coach Gibbs has put together to write the chapters is second to none.

I have always been a fan of Joe Gibbs, both as a coach and a vocal Christian. I recommend this book to men and challenge them to accept this plan for their lives.

I liked how Joe used his personal life to shed light on how a faith journey takes place. He then brought in an expert to go deeper into the faith side of what Joe had gone through. It was a very helpful book and an easy read."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Olson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5133486-jennifer-olson", "userReview": "This just might be the revival you're looking for, or the answer to emptiness in your life. Yes, this book is geared towards men, and it's about sports, but this book can really be for everyone, and you don't have to know a thing about football to understand it. Joe Gibbs authors this book, with the help of several others who each author a specific topic of expertise, from finance to health to heaven and much more. Some may say that this is just another religious book, but it's not. It's 100 times more insightful than any religious service in which I have ever been! I was raised in church, and even went to private Christian schools for several years. I went to every revival meeting, every Wednesday night prayer, every Sunday school.... I even had Bible classes in school. This book blew my mind! The depth that these coauthors went to are amazing by my standards. I'm impressed, inspired, and stronger in my faith than I was when I picked this book up."}, {"userName": "Longbeverly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5267216-longbeverly", "userReview": "I enjoyed some of the chapters in this book. I actually copied the one on the Bible because it had myths vs. facts (concise charts for prophecies fulfilled and ancient manuscript copies). Josh McDowell wrote that one and of course is always good. I have trouble reading sports figures' writing because they tend to repeat themselves and I find myself skimming along. That must be necessary in coaching - repeat, repeat, repeat. This is a positive, uplifting book."}, {"userName": "A.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5174097-a", "userReview": "This book's intended audience is men. However, I have to say, as a woman no less, that this is one of the best books I have ever read. It is easy to read and so well-thought out. It truly is a playbook for success.

Man or woman, this is one book that everyone will enjoy reading."}, {"userName": "Jason J", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4400874-jason-j", "userReview": "Great overview of different aspects of life from a Christian perspective. Great way to connect to Dads and friends who may not be too into reading 'spiritual' or Christian books. Material is relevant and doesn't lack much - good, solid teaching.

I enjoy reading about individuals who are very competitive and struggle to figure out how to combine that with a deep abiding faith in God. Joe Gibbs does an excellent job in expressing that in this book.

I found the chapter on heaven particularly helpful for me. To be reminded of the HOPE that we have for the future can definitely help bring us through this life's challenges and multiply our joy during the good times.
