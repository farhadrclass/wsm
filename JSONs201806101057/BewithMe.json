Wow. This book was well written, very sexy, and had so many elements of truth to it. Be With Me by Maya Banks was only my second novel by this author, with my first being Sweet Surrender. I liked Be With Me so much more than the first book of hers I read. Maybe it was the three hot men, yes I said three! Maybe it was the spunky yet sensitive female protagonist that kept me engrossed. I think it was a combination of everything, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my journey.Hutch Bishop, Cam Douglas, and Sawyer Pritchard were young boys when they met and became like brothers in the foster care system under the watchful eye of their foster mother Birdie. She cared for them, taught them to be respectful young men, as well as teaching them to protect what is theirs. When their childhood crush Regina Fallon grows up to be a police officer, the three of them support her, even though they worry that she might get hurt. Regina loves all three men, and yet she ran away as fast as she could after one night when everything changed. One night of unbelievable passion, the best night of her life, and Regina leaves in a hurry. Worried that she may have ruined everything with the men she loves the most. Hutch, Cam and Sawyer have let Reggie run, deciding to give her space, letting her feel in control until one night they get a frantic call from Birdie saying Reggie has been attacked. All three of them rush to Reggie\u2019s side, vowing to take care of her and never let her go. Now all they have to do is convince Reggie that they can protect her, share her and all love her equally. Reggie is so worried about losing them that she\u2019s too scared to give this relationship a chance. She has to deal with an overbearing father, a deranged attacker and an obligation to her career\u2026 how can she possibly handle loving three men? I loved this story. I know that a m/m/m/f m\u00e9nage sounds unbelievable, and it probably is, but Maya Banks did a great job making this story seem realistic. She dealt with jealousies and possessiveness that most authors sweep under the rug. This book wasn\u2019t always harmony and happiness. There were times of anger and hurt feelings, but there was also communication and compromise, much like any true relationship needs to survive. Be With Me was touching and sweet, but it was also a really good mystery with a great plot, as well as a very steamy romance. To be honest, I was surprised that the sex didn\u2019t start much earlier in the book. I was probably more than halfway through before the really hot stuff started. This is an attention grabbing Romantica book, and a great introduction to m\u00e9nage books if you haven\u2019t read one before. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Auntee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/886675-auntee", "userReview": "This was quite a different menage book for me. Usually the ones I've read have the heroes/heroine just establish the menage relationship almost by accident and you get the feeling that they really haven't thought it all out or how it would work, as far a dealing with potential problems of sharing or jealousies. They just get right down to it and maybe afterward start to think about problems they may encounter. Not so with this book. There was lots and lots of angst and talking about if they (the heroes) thought a permanent menage relationship could work for them and the heroine. Almost too much talking about it at times. Although I appreciated the author's perspective of having all parties involved deciding if they indivually could live with this kind of relationship, it did keep the story from taking off quicker. But once the heroes and heroine were finally on the same page and decided to give it a shot--yikes, did this book get hot!Regina (Reggie, as only the heroes called her) is a cop. She's small but feisty, and very prickly. She's definitely the alpha in her lifelong friendship with the three heroes of this story, Cam, Sawyer, and Hutch. She comes from money; her dad is the town mayor, and she never felt loved by her cold and distant parents. Her parents always disapproved of her relationship with the three boys she met as a young child. All were childhood troublemakers, largely brought up in foster care by Birdie, a woman they grew to love like a mother, as did Reggie. As they grew into adults, they remained friends, and Cam became an architect and owned a construction company with Sawyer and Hutch, while Reggie went on to become a police officer. One night they spent an incredible night of passion together, which blew their collective minds, but freaked out Reggie. She immediately ran the morning after, refusing to discuss that night with her lifelong friends. Although it was the best night of her life, she doesn't believe that she can give what her three friends want from her, so she avoids them. One night while on the job, she stumbles onto a murder scene, and is nearly beaten to death and ends up hospitalized. Birdie calls Cam, Sawyer and Hutch, and they come running to her side. After convincing Reggie to come home with them, they decide to lay it on the line, and ask Reggie to consider a personal relationship with all three of them. It's been a year without the three of them in her life, and while she loves and misses them, does she love them enough to possibly risk her career and face what society will think of her relationship? And can she be everything each guy needs her to be?As I said, things start out slowly in this book, with each party involved getting plenty of time to weigh the pros and cons of a relationship they all are considering. The characters each have different personalities, and you get a clear picture of everyone involved. I found it sometimes amusing that Reggie was the alpha of the group (well, I guess Sawyer was too) and the guys seemed only too happy to do her bidding. She had Hutch to cook for her, Cam was the guy she could talk to the most, and Sawyer was, well the big hulking tough guy with a heart of gold. What more could a girl ask for? I also found it interesting that two of the guys were very inexperienced when it came to sex, but they definitely knew what to do with Reggie! There is also a suspense plot about someone trying to harm Reggie that the story is built around, and it did keep me guessing for a while about who the bad guy was. But mainly this was about Reggie deciding if she wanted to live the rest of her life with her three best friends, and how they would make it work. It takes a good while for the sex scenes to start, but once they do, hold on, because it gets mighty, mighty hot!This may not be my favorite Maya Banks story, but it definitely developed into a very hot and interesting read, with a unique take on the menage relationship. A very solid 4 star read!"}, {"userName": "I \u2665 Bookie Nookie (bookienookiereviews.blogspot.com)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1488662-i-bookie-nookie-bookienookiereviews-blogspot-com", "userReview": "I wasn't sure how this book would finally land on me, but I have to say--I really liked it! Picture the lonely rich girl who befriends the town juvenile delinquents--one is sensitive, smart and self motivated with an alpha side she didn't know existed--another is a \"meat head\" who is all testosterone and rough around the edges--the other is tender and caring and treats her like a fragile glass doll-- but they are all smokin' hot and totally in love with Reggie. Ten years later, as adults, they realize after a night of passion (when they all have sex with her at the same time) that they would rather share her than make her choose or give her up. Will she go for it? It's going to take some convincing, but they are a pretty persuasive trio... I enjoyed the entire book. There was no part that lulled--the characters were well developed. In the beginning, I was thinking: I can hardly keep up with the demands of one man, much less 3--good lord, she is a goddess.

From the first page, Maya Banks had me completely hooked. I pretty much didn't put it down until I finished. It was a very interesting, very well-written (and pretty hot) story.Though in general this book is considered an erotic romance, I'd probably call it a contemporary alternative romance with erotic scenes because the super hot, explicit sex isn't really the dominant part of the story. It's more about the polyamorous relationship the develops between four long-time friends and the problems that arise than about hot and kinky sex.Reggie, a rich-girl, politician's daughter, and Hutch, Sawyer and Cam, three juvenile delinquent foster, boys became friends around junior high and remained close ever since. Over the years, their feelings grew and changed until one fateful night things turned passionate between the four. For Cam, Sawyer and Hutch, it was exactly what they wanted. Each loved Reggie and each realized they could never make her choose between them. So they decided the solution was for all of them to love her in a menage relationship. The only problem? That one night of love scared Reggie so much she cut herself off from her best friends. A year later, when she's injured in the line of duty by some psycho who seems to want her dead, Cam, Sawyer and Hutch come riding to the rescue and decide it's time to make Reggie face what's between them. What I loved most about this book was how real it was. With most (all) of the menage books I've read, they've generally been very sex-based and not dealing with much else. Which, hey, is fun to read, but not altogether realistic. But in Be With Me Maya Banks explores the nuances involved in a group of individuals deciding to enter into a multi-partner relationship. Reggie fights herself for a year over the potential relationship, thinking about how it would appear to others and affect her life, and how it would ever be possible to have equality when she would be involved with three men - i.e. how to avoid the appearance of favorites, and who and how she chose to be with at any given time. And the men, despite being the ones to come up with the idea, still have worries about the plausibility. They wonder if they'd feel jealousy or left out. Each freely admits that in a perfect world, they'd have Reggie to themselves. And there was that one scene where one of the guys is hesitant to do something sexually because it meant he might touch another male. Those things all made this book so much more realistic because they are genuine issues related to a menage relationship. And I enjoyed reading that angle. It gave the book a lot of depth.True, it did mean that the book wasn't as erotic as many expected. But that didn't bother me. I knew before hand (having read others' reviews) what it was going to be like, so I didn't expect a sex-fest. And it ended up not mattering to me because the rest of the book was so engaging. It was very interesting to read. I also liked how Banks utilized issues from the guys' pasts and how they affected the budding relationship with Maggie - Sawyer's worries about his darker nature, Hutch's protectiveness because of what he went through as a kid, and the incident that resulted in a fight because of those issues. Very nicely done.Plus there was the added bonus of a mildly suspenseful side story; the part about someone trying to off Reggie. It actually might have been a little superfluous. I could see the book working without it. But it added a nice dimension to the story and was well-written.Oh, and hey, there was some really yummy sex ;) Can't discount that!So yeah...I loved this book. There wasn't really anything about it that I didn't like. As for recommending it? I definitely would!...but with a sidenote or two. This is a great book to read for those of you who like to read romance in general, are open-minded, and don't mind very explicit sex. But if you're just looking for erotica with romantic overtones or pure erotica, then you might want to skip this one. Because like I said earlier, this book is more like a contemporary alternative romance with erotic scenes than a straight up erotica novel."}, {"userName": "Tink Magoo is bad at reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38603325-tink-magoo-is-bad-at-reviews", "userReview": "3.5"}, {"userName": "Julie (jjmachshev)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/882708-julie-jjmachshev", "userReview": "Why are Maya Banks books so hot? It's not just her skillful handling of menage situations, it's the emotion that underscores the relationships of her characters that draws me to her stories. \"Be With Me\" is another excellent offering from the queen of menage HEAs.Regina, or Reggie, has been running from her three best friends for the past year. Ever since a night of scorching sex, she's been unable to come to terms with what she wants, what she's afraid they want, and what society can handle. But her running time has just come to an end. When she's attacked and beaten on her job as a cop and it looks like it might have been a set-up just for her, nothing can keep her three men away. Now Reggie will have to make a decision...to keep her loves or let them go.Hutch, Cam, and Sawyer are all so different. All three were children in the social services system until, one by one, they were taken in by Birdie. Under her care they became brothers and now run a construction company together. The bonds they have with each other are just as strong as the love all three hold for Reggie. When she's attacked, they all agree that it's time to face the future. And these three will do what's necessary to make sure Reggie is a part of it.Although I really can't see how the situation would work in real life, it's hard not to long to be loved so fiercely. Maybe that's what Banks readers enjoy so much...well that and the scorching sex! The mystery was not as good as some of her past books, but the three heroes make up for it...in spades. You'll fall in love with all three and then start tapping your toes waiting for Banks next book."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11818290-sarah", "userReview": "[It turned out to be the old 'surprise brother' plot twist.

So often, I find that erotic romances are basically a sex-fest with little actual story or character development to speak of, which might account for why I don't read the genre more frequently. Be with Me most definitely does not fall into that trap. In fact, despite having three scrumptious, virile men as its heroes, there's no sex until nearly halfway into the book. After that the author certainly makes up for it, but not at the expense of the plot. I learned a few years back when taking a class on writing love scenes, taught by the incomparable Elizabeth Hoyt, that each love scene should reveal something about one or more of the characters and/or propel the plot forward. Maya Banks is a masterful author who definitely knows how to do this. Each love scene is perfectly placed for maximum story development, therefore making all of them integral to the plot. They also don't completely overwhelm the story. There's actually still a suspense sub-plot too in which it appears someone is trying to kill the heroine and which is deftly woven into the rest of the story. It was also equally well-written, because I was surprised by who the killer turned out to be and how that part of the story played out. Even with all of its super-steamy love scenes, Be with Me was a book with more depth and substance than many mainstream romances I've read, which was a very pleasant surprise.Our heroine, Regina (nicknamed Reggie by her men), is a kick-ass police officer in a small Texas town about an hour away from Houston. She finished at the top of her class and is really good at her job. Many romance heroines I've read who are in similar positions seem to feel like they have a lot to prove and therefore can be really tough nuts to crack. This makes it difficult for me to relate to them, because they lack any feminine softness. Not so with Reggie. I really loved her as a heroine, because she seems to be secure and respected at her job, as well as confident in her abilities without being cocky. She's every bit as protective of her men as they are of her, but she knows how to dial it down a notch and simply accept their loving overtures. She can still be stubborn at times, much to their chagrin, but overall, I felt like she had a good balance between her softer feminine side and her kick-butt and take names career. This made her so much easier for me to relate to than many similar heroines. Reggie has known and loved Cam, Hutch, and Sawyer for most of her life. They met and played together as kids, but things didn't become intimate between all of them until a year before the story begins. At that point, one of Reggie's typical nights with the guys became anything but typical when it took an unforgettably sexy turn. Ever since making love to all three of them at once, she's struggled with what she wants. She still loves all of them and misses them terribly, but she's scared of the kind of relationship they want from her. I felt like her fears were very realistic and understandable. She worries about making the other two guys jealous if she gives her attention to one. She worries about how she can possibly be all things to three very different men. And she worries about what others might think of her, knowing that with small-town gossip, word will surely get around that she's \u201cshacking up\u201d with three guys, and what that might mean for her career. Reggie also struggles to some extent with feeling worthy of the love and attentions of the three men, because she's never really experienced the kind of love and devotion they're offering her in her life. Her parents were extremely wealthy and hands-off while she was growing up, and even now that she's an adult, they seem more worried about their own reputation than about her safety. I really enjoyed seeing how Reggie overcame all her fears and doubts and how much she grew as a person as the story progressed.And now on to her three scrumptious men.:-) Cam, Hutch, and Sawyer all had rough childhoods. If I remember correctly, it was when they were around ten years old that they all came to live with their foster mother, Birdie, who is the sweetest lady and an absolute saint. It wasn't until then that they finally understood what it meant to be unconditionally loved by someone. They had all been headed down a rocky path, but Birdie's love turned them around. Although unrelated by blood, they consider each other and Birdie to be their only family now. The three boys met Reggie while playing outside on the border of Birdie's property and Reggie's parents' property. In spite of being from opposite sides of the track, they became inseparable best friends until the day they made love with her and she went running scared. The three men have all built a life together as the owners of a construction company and now they've built a house, Reggie's dream house, in hopes of one day convincing her to be their one and only love.I'll start with Cam who was my favorite of the three guys, because he embodies many of my favorite qualities in a man. He has long hair, wears glasses, and is highly intelligent. He's an architect who designs all the buildings for their construction company. He's pretty much the peacemaker of the three, always trying to be the calm voice of reason and smooth things over when circumstances get heated. He's also very gentle and tender and knows how to sweet-talk a lady and treat her right. I love that he's not vastly experienced in the bedroom and that he's been celibate since the night they had their foursome, knowing that there's no other woman for him besides Reggie. Cam, IMHO, leans more beta, but he has a couple of sexy moments where he gets his alpha on. Overall, Cam is basically my dream man. Yum!;-)Hutch is a very, very close second. He's had a thing for Reggie since they were just kids and she decked both of his brothers for making fun of him. He's always kind of thought of Reggie as his, so he has to make a few adjustments in his thinking in order to accept sharing her with his brothers. Hutch is simply too sweet for words. He's even less experienced than Cam, not quite virginal, but certainly close. He's also been celibate, which I think shows how much he loves Reggie. Hutch is also the best cook of the three, and one way to a woman's heart (or at least mine anyway:-)) is through her stomach. Like with Cam, I thought Hutch was beta-leaning, but he has a couple of alpha moments when he goes to bat to protect Reggie. One of those times was admittedly misguided and stirred up some trouble amongst the foursome, but his reasons are deeply sympathetic. Hutch is a really wonderful guy, and in the end, I fell nearly as much in love with him as I did with Cam.I'm sure a majority of readers probably preferred Sawyer, but I'm usually less inclined to fall hard for alphas. Sawyer is most definitely a pretty intense alpha male. He's kind of a he-man at times, and to emphasize that fact, he's a really big guy with a shaved head and goatee. Out of the three, he's the one with the overactive libido and kinky tendencies. What made Sawyer likable to me, though, is his vulnerabilities. He knows he isn't as sweet and gentle as his brothers, so he holds back from Reggie at first, not wanting to hurt her. She finally has to goad him into having sex with her, but she discovers a liking for his intense brand of love-making too. When things get heated with Hutch, Sawyer shows another kind of vulnerability that touched my heart. He can also dial down the intensity sometimes, and even though he doesn't think he's good with words, he could occasionally surprise both me and Reggie by saying nice things. Ultimately, I did like Sawyer too, just not quite as much as I like Cam and Hutch.Where I think Maya Banks showed incredible mastery is in her characterizations. I loved how she explored all the emotions of a committed polyamorous relationship like what she was presenting. She doesn't shy away from jealousies or conflict between all the parties, but at the same time, she doesn't go overboard with it either. Things can get heated at times, but they all trust each other and take the time to work things out without silly misunderstandings. I loved the communication amongst all of them, and how they know that it's going to take hard work to maintain what they have just like any relationship would. I felt like there was a level of stark honesty between them, which I found refreshing. I also liked that they've all thought ahead to what might face them with regards to backlash from the community.Be with Me was a pure pleasure to read, because of how much more depth it has than many other erotic romances I've read. There's a lot of meat to the story. I also loved the characters and thought they made the perfect foursome. Reggie is tough while also knowing how and when to give in to her men's TLC. And the guys\u2026 well all I can say is the only thing better than one hot, sexy romance hero is three.;-) I love how they take care of Reggie and look out for her safety, while not expecting her to change. It may bother them that she works in a dangerous profession, but they'd never ask her to quit. They also would never ask her to choose between them, which is why they chose this unconventional path. It also makes them all pretty close to perfection in my book. I loved every minute I spent reading Be with Me. It was my first book by Maya Banks, but most definitely won't be my last. I can't wait to delve into more of her work and hope that it's equally sinful, sexy, and filled with substance as this story was.Note: This book contains explicit language and sexual situations which may offend some readers, including m\u00e9nage a quatre, some bondage, a little spanking, and anal sex within M/F, M/F/M and M/F/M/M combinations."}, {"userName": "Denise ~The Procrastinating Book Diva~", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4133839-denise-the-procrastinating-book-diva", "userReview": "By all accounts this should have been a good book. It had all of the elements of an excellent menage: bestselling author - check; 3 sexy diverse Heroes - check; a tough yet vulnerable heroine - check; and a history shared by the heroine and Heroes that solidified her relationships with them as individuals and a trio - check, check, check!!! Yet with all of this going for it, it just never came together for me. In fact I found it to be just plain boring!! I struggled to get through it and only finished it because I was reading it for a challenge.Reggie was tough one minute and annoyingly weak the next. The guys were refreshingly open and honest about their feelings. However, it felt like they talked incessantly about those feelings and everything else. At times I didn't know if I was reading erotica or a psych 101 textbook. The playful, witty banter between Reggie and the guys throughout the book was clearly filler and cutesy overkill.My favorite part of the book was figuring out who the bad guy was, but even that was marred by stupidity. When the police chief contacts Reggie to say that they've made an arrest, neither she, the trained law enforcement officer, nor the guys ask who it is - erhh??. Someone tried to kill the woman they love and her overprotective lovers never ask who it is? This was the final nail for me.Ms. Banks tried to write a menage with heart and failed miserably. The plot was weak, the characters one dimensional, and the sex scenes were bland and uninspiring (and believe me I desperately wanted to be inspired).

It was also predictable but Maya Banks wove a sweet but very spicy hot story doing it.I would recommend it to any and all that are into second chance romances, scorching multi lovin menages and/or relationships with a fair amount of decent suspense going on."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2466134-tina", "userReview": "This was either a very corny romance novel or a boring erotica. You couldn't go 5 pages without someone saying \"I Love You\". Most of the characters were flat, the three heroes were like androids walking around repeating the same things over and over . And this great love they feel for the heroine....why do they love her? Who knows. All we know is that these zombie like heroes (3) all love this wimpy girl. Mean while, this wimpy girl runs around whining about how wrong it is to be with 3 zombies (heroes).  The sappiness of this story just killed the sexual chemistry you seek from a erotica. And if you wanted the emotional connection you usually find in romance novels, this book couldn't deliver that due to the lack of character development.  All in all, this was a waste of my time. I kid you not when I tell you, the first real intercourse scene took place 170+ pages into the book *snort* and I almost fell asleep. Yep, it was that riveting. There are lots of C, P words and anal sex. I guess this equals erotica, which lots of people seem to find great even when its almost unreadable. Colters' Woman by the same author was half way decent. Try that, skip this."}, {"userName": "ChloeLeeNH", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/923550-chloeleenh", "userReview": "I am not normally an erotica reader but found this at my bookstore and was caught. Though the relationships between the heroine and the 3 heros was filled with angst most of the time the actually caring they all had for each other was nice.

Reggie was rich and beautiful and had everything a girl could want growing up. Everything except the love and attention of her parents. She found what she was missing in her three best friends who just happened to be boys. They all loved her. And she loved them back. Eventually they all grew up and those feelings manifested themselves in one night of passion. As in she has sex with all of them at the same time. So yes, this is not your usual romance novel. The guys all knew that Reggie would never choose between them, but they never thought that she would run from them. When Reggie\u2019s life is threatened the guys decide that she has run long enough. They rush to be by her side. To save her and to force her to face her feelings for all of them. What they are proposing seems impossible, but can Reggie really deny her feelings any longer? Who is threatening her life? Can she save herself and her heart before it\u2019s too late?Yes, the premise of this story is pretty unbelievable. Three men who are so in love with one woman that they are willing to share her is not exactly realistic. However, that is the point of reading, to escape reality. This book allows you to do just that. The plot behind the steamy love scenes is good enough to make you care about the characters. I barely realized that I was almost halfway through the book before any action went down. Maya Banks always delivers on the heat factor. The tension between all these characters reaches the boiling point before anything actually happens. And the payoff was absolutely worth the wait. Ms. Banks is certainly one of the best contemporary romance authors and never disappoints with the bedroom scenes. The rest of the story was great also and keeps you guessing till the very end. Proven point that plot does matter. This story keeps the reader invested and interested in the characters. 4 very hot stars and a nice cold lager!

This book was so chocked full of male testosterone I wanted to lick it! There I said it I am a bad Minxy. Reggie was a strong female lead, she fought this attraction for most of the book, confused by it even as the men in her life accepted it and came to terms with it. Again three very different men, brothers in life, if not in blood, the organised dominant, the edgy and rough, and the laid back and just downright sexy. She had a man for every mood! And a man who for no discernible reason was trying to kill her.Another mysterious tale from Maya Banks who skillfully intertwines the thriller with the trills of sexual exploration. If you want a book to get you hot under your frilly bikini as you sun on the beach, go for this. Trust me!There were five in the bed and the little one said 'roll over, roll over,' so they all rolled over and one fell out, they hit the floor and gave a shout, 'please remember to tie a knot in your pyjamas, single beds are only made for 1, 2, , 4...' There were four in the bed and the little one said.... ME!!! ME!!! ME!!!!!!!!!Sorry, I just had the urge to do that! My first exploration into menage a quatre, and I found it fun and sexy. The characters were distinct, articulate and alive, caring for their community as well as each other, supported by a wealth of fleshed out side characters which gave the story a soul. I Particularly loved a conversation in the police station with Birdie's friend, a little sweet old lady in pearls and gloves who was talking about how good she was with a shot gun!A great summer erotic read I give Be with Me four frilly knickers out of 5.

Or maybe I should call it a poly lifestyle book because this book was about much more than sex. It is one of the very few books that approached the myriad of issues that would arise with such a life style choice. Each of these men wanted her for themselves and only agreed to share because they knew if they asked her to choose between them she wouldn't and they would all loose her. There were issues of jealousy and how each man thought the others should be treating her sexually or how they felt they might be inferior to the lovemaking provided by the other guys. Real life issues stuff. Loved it. The sex scenes were there though and they were nicely done and all the guys felt distinctive, both in general and in bed. There was a bit of a suspense element which was okay but could have been developed a bit more. Also FYI the book was long enough to justify its hefty price tag IMO.

I'm a big fan of the happy threesome, so it's not that I have an issue with the whole notion of the Happy Foursome, but there was just a lot of language things throughout the novel that irked me. I did appreciate that Maya Banks tried to go beyond just, \"SEXSEXSEXXXXXXXXXX\" for a M/M/M/F novel. But unfortunately, the stuff that went beyond just sex got occasionally way too possessive/controlling/weird for me.I was also irked by the whole scene where Regina almost gets killed and what the guy decides to scream about is YOU COULD'VE BEEN RAPED. It is true. That would've been worse. Cue major league eye-rolling.But. It could've been worse? The guys just all blended together. The \"tough fucker\" was of course bald with a goatee and earrings, the sensitive one had glasses and longish hair, and then the boy next door was just kind of the most vanilla human being of all time. Not to mention the whole sequence of When Anal Sex Goes Wrong (Emotionally) was one of the most. Just. I sat there the whole time just slowly shaking my head at the mess. I think if I had approached it as porn in word form, I would've enjoyed it enough for 3 stars, but somehow the length of the novel had me convinced that it was going to be at least a little more fleshed out than that. But I think the combination of the long sex scenes, with trying to have a mystery/crime plot, on top of trying to characterize and create three 3D male leads just ended up making it a pretty flat read for me."}, {"userName": "Arlena", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6139982-arlena", "userReview": "Title: Be With MeAuthor: Maya BanksPublisher: Berkley HeatReviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: 5Review\"Be With Me\" by Maya BanksShe has a killer on her tail and three men in her bed?\"An author who knows how to please turns up the Heat in a sizzling new novel of erotic suspense?
