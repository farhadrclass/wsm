I never thought I would be able to calm myself and sit in silence. I was one of those people who go, go, go. Every minute of every day was in my day planner. This book taught me the importance of putting 'prayer' into my planner and how to let go of all 'that' and just 'be.' The author gives many different approaches with the hope that one of them will work for you. Highly recommended for anyone struggling with how to just 'be.'"}, {"userName": "Karen Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2168750-karen-smith", "userReview": "The impact this book made on my spiritual life has been legion.

It is not the type of reading I would usually choose and at first I was really resistant to the idea of keeping my mind \"centered\" by what seemed to me to be \"not thinking\" It seemed kind of anti intellectual and \"touchy feely\" for my taste. But I kept with it and while I never achieved exactly what the book seems to be describing some kind of meditative state beyond thought, I did find a lot that was solid and valuable in the readings and also the invitations to contemplation."}, {"userName": "Dave Irwin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11731805-dave-irwin", "userReview": "I think the most important thing I gained from this book is that I need...and want...to spend time with God. However, how I spend that time is important. Oftentimes my prayer time is focused on me, what I want, my prayer needs, my list of \"please Lord, take this pain away.\" I spend so much time talking...I never really just listen. Muyskens taught me to use centered prayer. The idea is to spend 20 minutes focused on God, listening. It is something I want to continue to do."}, {"userName": "brooke sellers", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61338-brooke-sellers", "userReview": "I'm just beginning to scratch the surface of the practice of centering/listening/contemplative prayer.

The practice of centering prayer has been such a blessing to find."}], "description": "Are you trying to do it all yourself? Muyskens reminds us that what God seeks is relationship with us, a two-way communication. What relationship with God requires is very similar to what our earthly relationships require: openness, listening, focused time. One way to practice the skills needed for this relationship is centering prayer, a simple but deeply powerful prayer practice. In beautiful and accessible language, Muyskens invites us to spend time daily focusing our hearts on God, to find the power to be still and be reoriented to \"the One who is the Center of all.\" Exercises in prayer and scripture reading are provided for the 40 days.", "title": "Forty Days to a Closer Walk with God: The Practice of Centering Prayer", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161174.Forty_Days_to_a_Closer_Walk_with_God", "average": 4.02, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348962280l/161174.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/93385.J_David_Muyskens", "name": "J.
