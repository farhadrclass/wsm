The premise was ridiculous and I hated pretty much every character except Heather. Especially Neal, GOD I hated Neal, what an awful, miserable person. I'm really confused as to how he's supposed to be an appealing character since he's not even described with any redeeming qualities really - a short, fat guy who never laughs, smiles or expresses his feelings in any way, apart from just silently projecting misery and resentment at his wife without ever actually bringing up the fact that anything is wrong. Every woman's dream! I couldn't understand why Georgie would have even wanted to marry him in the first place, let alone save their marriage which sounds horrible and depressing."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley", "userReview": "Updated September 6, 2014: Ugh, trying to write about each successive Rainbow Rowell novel gets more and more difficult. How many different ways are there to say THIS WAS SO GOOD. HER WORDS ARE SO GOOD. HER CHARACTERS SO GOOD. EVERYTHING GOOD. RELATE SO MUCH. HELP.That's pretty much all I feel like saying, because even over a month later, my feelings about this book are so jumbly wumbly it's hard to get them to sit still long enough to make them cohesive enough to write about.Granted, having never been married and never had a serious vocation like our main character Georgie McCool does, I don't relate quite as much to this book as I have in her previous efforts (Fangirl and Attachments in particular). But there's just something about the way Rainbow Rowell writes about emotions that makes me instantly think YES I RECOGNIZE THAT. It's like her books are the story versions of falling in love or making an instant connection with a person. Like, those rare instances where you meet someone and you just instantly KNOW them. I've only had that happen a couple of times in my life, which is probably part of why I love reading her so much.Just completely disregard the silly sounding plot with the time traveling phone. It's not important. It's just another way to explore the dynamics between people we care about, and how relationships can change and evolve, how we lose and find each other over and over again, how we have to commit to the relationships that are important to us. (Although, honestly, I think that kind of silly shit is incredibly cool.) Definitely glad I own this in hardcover, and I'm sure I will be revisiting it over and over in years to come, just like I plan to do with all her other books. Rainbow Rowell, why can't I quit you!?!? (Also, please don't stop writing these wonderful books. Please don't ever stop.)Updated July 30, 2014: GUH. WHY IS SHE SO GOOD AT WRITING BOOKS I LOVE. Full review later.June 2013: This doesn't sound like something I would necessarily pick up on my own, but I will read anything Rainbow Rowell writes, regardless of topic or genre. The list of authors I will do that for is not very large. I have lots of favorite books by authors I like, books I would probably stab people over (not really, just metaphorical stabbing), but a lot of those authors have also written books I will never read. But these authors? I love them and their words so much I don't even care. It goes like this: Rowling, Gaiman, Dahl, Sanderson, Green, Rothfuss, Rowell. That? Is trust."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "DNF about halfway through. As always, I like the author's narrative voice, but as a character sketch of a marriage, this wasn't quite sharp enough or funny enough or emotional enough for my taste. I also find Georgie's profession rather jarring, in that it was rather unrealistically portrayed in both the details and in Georgie's character. Had I never read Liane Moriarty, who writes excellent books that humorously dissect marriages and relationships, and had I never worked in entertainment, I might've liked this one better.Oh! And the only thing more tedious than being forced into phone conversations with young kids you don't have a relationship with is having to read about them."}, {"userName": "Ariel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6536286-ariel", "userReview": "Since this book hasn't been released yet (MWAHAHA I READ IT BEFORE EVERYONE!) I'm not going to say too much here, but I will be mentioning it on my channel closer to the release date. For now, here is a little blurb of my thoughts:This was a really different read, and I realized when finishing it that a big part of that is because it is NOT Young Adult. The cover looks it, Rainbow Rowell writes young adult, but this is adult and it shows. It's darker, it's more realistic, and it's less idealistic. And that's not bad at all, but it's sadder. The book started off harsher and the pay off wasn't as extravagant. All of that in mind, this book was wonderful. The characters were complex and unique and real, and their relationships where layered and difficult and full of history. The magical element in this book was a mixture of stressful and crazy exciting. And the main characters struggle was beautiful.I'm glad I read this, and I'm especially (MWAHAHAHA) glad I read it early, and I definitely recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Mikee Andrea (ReadWithMikee)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44137919-mikee-andrea-readwithmikee", "userReview": "\"You don't know when you're twenty-three.You don't know what it really means to crawl into someone else's life and stay there.

I finished this book in a handful amount of hours in \none sitting.\n Now I know why everybody seems to praise Rainbow Rowell so much. She's absolutely \namazing.\n Her writing is just so simple and easy to read. The story was fast-paced, cute, and bittersweet. I loved everything about it. I was already hooked after the first page. I honestly wonder how in the world the ratings for Landline aren't much higher!I always wondered what I would do when put in a similar situation as Georgie where I had to choose between my career or my family. Each time my answer is always the same: \nWhy can't I have both?\n Every book, every movie, or every show that models the same predicament debating which is of more importance (career or family), always seems to propose an either-or solution. \nWhere's the compromise?\n There has to be a solution in which both sides can win. But then again, if Georgie and Neal thought of a compromising solution at that time, this book wouldn't have came into existence so I won't complain much further. :DThis book made me cry. YES. \nCRY.\n It was just so darn cute and adorable and sad and just ugh. I was crying because I seriously couldn't handle all the \nfeels\n that Landline gave me. How in the world does that even happen? Guys, seriously though. I was bawling. And depressed. Because it was so bittersweet and cute.I didn't even expect this to be a \nChristmas-y\n type of story but I'm so glad I just spontaneously decided to read it because it brought so much holiday cheer and tears to my heart.Landline is the cutest thing I've ever read and if you didn't think so, then we can't be friends.

Since it won \"BEST FICTION\" on Goodreads in 2014.....I figured then it must be worth a $1.99. ...( the sale price at the time). It was sooooo 'fair' that when I saw that my overdrive library had it available, too, - I thought it might be better as an audio -- afterall - the name of the book is called \"Landline\".Well- reading it - or listening to it - I enjoyed this conversation ( the story), for about as long as I do many phone conversations: Enjoyable for awhile - nice connecting with my friends - even up to two hours is 'great'.... not bad ... but any longer than 2 hours, I'm ready to set the landline down! Can anyone tell me WHY .......THIS book won BEST FICTION? It's a mystery to me! Even if .....'if'.......( and that won't be me ), a reader gave it 5 stars -- did they really believe this was the best fiction of the year? It's almost as shocking as this years Presidential election. One thing I 'did' enjoy about this story - right off the bat....'was' the line of communication choice.Evening conversations-OVER THE TELEPHONE- not skype - not texting- took place between Neal and Georgie. I liked the pure symbolism of what the landline phone with the twirly cord represents to me. I liked enjoying my own memories. I use to speak on my princess landline phone for hours a night during 8th grade. Ron and I talked on the phone. We did our homework over the landline - ate our snacks - talked about music -school gossip - our families - and strengthen our relationship. I wore his ring around my neck all year long. We're still friends today.When I would see Ron at school during the day back in 8th grade- we barely talked to one another. He sat with the 'boys'. Me with the 'girls'. One day I got tired of the segregation---( He was the greatest on the telephone each night) -- but stepping over the line to the boys side during lunch was off limits to girls. Enough was enough. One day - I got so mad -- walked across the invisible WALL OF DO NOT ENTER..... and threw my ring at him. [years later- we laugh about it... I said I was sorry - but he said he deserved it] ....The only problem was --- BACK in 8th grade - I lost too, by getting mad -- I lost my wonderful evening landline phone chats.... with my best friend. The LANDLINE with the wiggly long cord had many memories for many of us old farts. But now with texting, email, and Facebook - most of us don't even own a landline anymore. Different memories! There were parts of this story that went - FLAT - but I like what Rainbow was trying to do. Her overall message was sincere and valuable. Take time to really connect with the person we love most - The Landline was a magical tool in supporting a married couple find their hearts back to each other. Resentments were stacking up.... (their jobs, kids, required demands).....So..... a little 'fairy tale' type story takes over.... Georgie begins to connect - by landline- when Neal is away on business - not just with her old raga muffin husband, instead she gets the 'younger' Neal.... the guy she first fell in love with. It's a cute idea ... enjoyable 'enough'... but Best fiction? Now that's funny! 3 stars for a solid. \"I liked enough\". A few great ideas that went flat."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10762033-maureen", "userReview": "IMPORTANT NOTE: if you don't want to be spoiled for the TV show lost, hold off on reading this book until you are done watching it. ~*~PSA OVER~*~I really enjoyed this book a lot.

I never thought I\u2019d say this of a Rainbow Rowell novel but my reading experience with this one bordered between a little \u201cmeh\u201d and sort of \u201clike\u201d. It\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s a story about an old yellow landline that magically lets 2013 Georgie talk to her husband, Neal, in his 1998 version. It\u2019s a little \u201cmeh\u201d because after more than 310 pages, nothing big really happened. \tGeorgie and Neal\u2019s marriage is at the brink of falling off the cliff. Georgie clearly knows the cause but she still lets Neal and her two wonderful little girls go off to Omaha for their supposedly family Christmas break without her because of her job. As a consequence, she couldn\u2019t work well which kind of defeats the purpose of her sacrificial stay. Depressed and worried, Georgie stays at her mom\u2019s house while her family is away. In her old room is the old yellow phone that lets her talk to her 1998 Neal that basically sums up the majority of the plot.\tIt\u2019s appealing because the author has this inherent writing ability to make any story easy to read but a little disappointing because for a story that is supposed to be magical, there wasn\u2019t any real spark about the characters and their relationships. The supposedly magical object wasn\u2019t really substantial to the story. To me, it only felt like an accessory to add something surreal. I was waiting for a huge epiphanic moment for Georgie but in the end, she simply does what she knows she was supposed to do a long time ago. With or without magic time travel phone, she easily would have still reached such a realization. \tI know I\u2019ve been sounding like a really annoying pessimist lately, it\u2019s probably this reading slump that has settled deep in my muscles which I just refuse to acknowledge because I still couldn\u2019t let go of this delusion that I\u2019m immune to this terrible disease. :( On the bright side, it\u2019s still an easy, light read for the approaching Holidays. Also, I have always been a fan of Rowell\u2019s writing and that\u2019ll always be a plus!^^  Lookin' for reviews with more positive vibes?

Accidental damage protection.\u201d3.5/5 starsAfter reading Fangirl, Rainbow Rowell had a safe and warm place in my booklover's heart. Of course I was thrilled to get my hands on Landline.First things first: the novel is dedicated to \"Kai\". Big plus Mrs. Rowell, very big plus!It was easy and nice reading Landline, but the plot was weak, to be frank. There wasn't much happening, characters and not answered phone calls and a self-pitying protagonist kept bothering me. I wondered where this was going, and it wasn't going anywhere really.But I believe Rainbow Rowell tries to tell you something important. To not take people for granted. To tell the people you love that you love them. To really love them. To not give up. To accept that there are different kinds of love. To let people love whoever they want to love.I always have a hard time rating Rowell's books. They have a flaw here and there, things that really bother me or could be improved. I struggle between giving 3 or 4 stars. But then there's the amazing writing, the dialouges, the fun. I can easily read her books in one sitting, because they give me that warm and fuzzy feeling. Which is why keep rounding the rating up to 4 stars.In a nutshell: I liked Landline. And I gave an extra point for the countless Harry Potter references.

It\u2019s something you make happen\u2014because you love each other.\n\nThere are reasons that this book resonates with me. It hits home on so many of my own fears and hopes and dreams. Not so much the magic telephone part of it because I came from a time when rotary phones weren\u2019t just a novelty item but the I\u2019ve been with the same person for so long that sometimes I forget we are two individual people instead of just one entity.\nYou don't know what it really means to crawl into someone else's life and stay there. You can't see all the ways you're going to get tangled, how you're going to bond skin to skin. How the idea of separating will feel in five years, in ten - in fifteen. When Georgie thought about divorce now, she imagined lying side by side with Neal on two operating tables while a team of doctors tried to unthread their vascular systems. \nOkay my husband and I are not Neal and Georgie but we could have been and we could be still. It\u2019s been ten years since he and I had our meet-cute when he lied about his name when my friend hit on him at a bar and eight years since he gave me a ring in a DVD box for the movie \u2018The Ring\u2019, which incidentally I did not find funny or endearing at the time and threw across the room at him. But as time goes by sometimes we forget and take for granted that the person you\u2019ve chosen to spend your life with should be your first priority. When they are always there it is easy to forget everything they do for you, every way they fill your life and how much better you are with them.\n\u201cIt wasn't just that she let him down, and put him off, and continually left him waiting--It was that she'd tied him to her so tight. Because she wanted him. Because he was perfect for Georgie, even if she wasn't perfect for him. Because she wanted him more than she wanted him to be happy.\nOverview:When we meet Georgie and Neal they are at a crucial point in their relationship. Georgie has decided to work through the Christmas break in hopes of getting a show she has been working on for years on TV. Neal has decided that he and their children will still go away to his mother\u2019s for Christmas. Even though he never officially claims that he is leaving her, Georgie\u2019s family just assumes that Neal has taken the kids and left her. This is when Georgie gets a wake-up call that is maybe very overdue. She tries to get a hold of Neal on his cell phone but due to all kinds of complications they just keep missing each other and eventually she is sure that maybe he is avoiding her. Georgie is frantic to get a hold of Neal and using a rotary phone dials his number of his mother\u2019s house in Nebraska, but what she gets is not the man that is her husband but an earlier version of him who is still in college before they were married. \n\u201cI take for granted that you\u2019ll be there when I\u2019m done doing whatever it is I\u2019m doing. I take for granted that you\u2019ll love me no matter what.\u201d\nWhat Worked for Me:I love Rainbow Rowell\u2019s writing there is no part of the words that she puts on page that I don\u2019t think is amazing. I got so drawn into the references to the 80s and 90s that were thrown in seamlessly and the conversations that all of her characters have. Every character that she incorporated into her story seemed to belong there and have a solid place in Georgie\u2019s life.Besides Neal who was almost a saint like husband to Georgie, some of my favorite characters were her family. Her mom in particular was a trip and like most mothers when they think you are in a crisis how she wanted to jump in and help.\n\u201cGeorgie's mother had spectacular cleavage. Tan, freckled, ten miles deep.\"Genetics,\" her mom said when she caught Georgie looking.Heather shoved a bowl of green beans into Georgie's arm. \"Were you just staring at Mom's breasts?\"\"I think so,\" Georgie said. \"I'm really tired--and she's kinda begging for it in that shirt.\"\"Oh, sure,\" Heather said. \"Blame the victim.\u201d\nI also loved Georgie\u2019s little girls. They were seven and four and acted seven and four. I loved that her 4 year old was in love with cats and sometimes just said \u2018meow\u2019. I totally appreciated that when she was on the phone with them you could sense the frustration of trying to talk to a seven year old on the phone when they are distracted by T.V.Rainbow writes some of the best dialogue and characters in contemporary fiction. I fall in love with them and I replay conversations in my head days and weeks later. I was rooting for Georgie and Neal the entire time and with every new flashback to their beginnings I hoped they found a way back to one another in the present even more. That is why I enjoyed most of this book. I Loved the writing even if I only liked the story.I always want a little more at the end of RR books but that is kind of her signature leave off point. Actually she gave us more in the ending of this one than in E&P and Fangirl. It seemed very fitting to leave off right where she did and it was enough closure for me that I will put it in the plus column.What Didn\u2019t Work for Me:The magic phone, I\u2019m not sure it was needed. Okay I\u2019ll take it and she did a decent job of throwing it in there and had some funny inner dialogue about the magic phone\u2026but I didn\u2019t love it. I almost thought that the same thing could have been done with love letters she found in the attic or maybe reading through some of her old college works from The Spoon and remembering her time there. But there is a magic phone I accept it and it led to some interesting conversations it just was a little eh for me.Final thoughts:While this isn\u2019t as good as Eleanor and Park or Fangirl, in my humble opinion, I still very much liked it. I must have liked it I highlighted almost 15% of the book. My advice read it, it is a great story and if you have been in a relationship for a long time I think a lot of the points will hit home. I give this a 5 star for the writing and a 3 star for the plot, 4 star total."}, {"userName": "Maria Angelica", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5319699-maria-angelica", "userReview": "4.5Antes de falar o que eu achei desse livro, quero deixar BEM CLARO que ele \u00e9 um livro adulto. Se voc\u00ea ainda n\u00e3o teve um relacionamento s\u00e9rio com algu\u00e9m, talvez essa n\u00e3o seja uma est\u00f3ria que ir\u00e1 apreciar. Vai depender mesmo de quais s\u00e3o as suas expectativas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a um relacionamento s\u00e9rio, na verdade. Eu tinha uma ideia completamente enganada do que era antes de iniciar um com o meu marido e agora sei que \u00e9 um esfor\u00e7o di\u00e1rio para mant\u00ea-lo. Que n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 amar algu\u00e9m como m\u00e1gica. Esse livro me inspirou em ser ser melhor no meu pr\u00f3prio casamento e apreciar 100x mais o meu marido. Ele foi uma \u00f3tima an\u00e1lise sobre quanto nos dedicamos de verdade para os nossos relacionamentos. Por isso amei tanto esse livro. Por causa de seu realismo. Na real, a Rainbow Rowell \u00e9 especialista em retratar a realidade de relacionamentos em seus livros. Landline \u00e9 um livro dedicado exclusivamente a isso e foi perfeito na sua miss\u00e3o. Eu senti o amor que a Georgie e o Neal tinham um pelo outro desde a primeira cena em que est\u00e3o juntos, por mais tensa que fosse. Senti tamb\u00e9m as dificuldades de manter um casamento durante anos, quando j\u00e1 ca\u00edmos na complac\u00eancia e comodidade. Eu amei que o livro \u00e9 contado dentro do presente e passado, \u00e0 medida que a Georgie ia se tocando de suas falhas no seu casamento. Dessa forma eu fui me identificando com todos os momentos de seu relacionamento. Desde que se conheceram at\u00e9 o presente estado. Adorei que eles obviamente n\u00e3o era perfeitos um para o outro (afinal tinha o Seth para exemplificar que teria um outro par \"melhor\" para ela), mas que quando nos apaixonamos por algu\u00e9m e sentimos o potencial de uma vida juntos, o esfor\u00e7o para que d\u00ea certo \u00e9 meramente uma consequ\u00eancia natural desse amor que brota.Vale a pena mencionar a aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o da Georgie e da sua irm\u00e3 Heather durante o livro. N\u00e3o \u00e9 nem de perto um dos elementos mais importante, mas foi t\u00e3o gostoso de ler. Elas n\u00e3o t\u00eam um relacionamento mais pr\u00f3ximo por causa da diferen\u00e7a de idade, mas conseguiram ao final do livro estabelecer um que seja melhor que o que tinham anteriormente. Se conheceram um pouco mais.Minha \u00fanica reclama\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 que o Neal por vezes me pareceu perfeito demais e eu sei, por experi\u00eancia pr\u00f3pria, que um casamento precisa de duas pessoas comprometidas para dar certo. Ele era mais comprometido que ela? Sim, definitivamente! Mas gostaria que a Rainbow tivesse mencionado no final do livro que ele tamb\u00e9m deixou a peteca cair quando fez todas as vontades da Georgie durante anos. Sim, ela tinha mais culpa no cart\u00f3rio que ele, mas se tivesse falado antes a sua insatisfa\u00e7\u00e3o com a dedica\u00e7\u00e3o eterna dela ao trabalho, talvez as coisas n\u00e3o tivessem chegado ao ponto que chegaram.Eu consumi esse livro em menos de tr\u00eas dias. Comecei pelo audiobook e terminei com o livro f\u00edsico, porque n\u00e3o aguentaria esperar o tempo que demora para ouvir a est\u00f3ria. A escrita da Rainbow Rowell tem algum tipo de droga que faz com que n\u00e3o queiramos parar de ler seus livros. \u00c9 impressionante. Foi assim para mim com Fangirl e Carry On. \u00c9 simples e gostosa de ler. Fora que eu AMO as figuras de linguagem que ela usa. Sempre s\u00e3o mais reais que floreadas. Enfim, mais um sucesso dela embaixo do meu bra\u00e7o.PS: Estou pouco me lixando para a quantidade de vezes que eu usei a palavra realidade e suas varia\u00e7\u00f5es. \u00c9 o maior descritivo da escrita de RR e n\u00e3o tem forma melhor de falar sobre ela sem usar essas palavras.

I sort of fell in love with this one.When it comes to audiobooks, it is nearly impossible to sort out what is good simply because the writing was good and what was good because the narrator was good. In this case, it was both. This is the second audiobook that I've listened to from Rainbow Rowell, the first being Attachments, and both narrators were amazing. Rebecca Lowman was a total pro, nailing each character. Her male voices were sexy, something that I often struggle with with female narrators, and her voice for Georgie was spot on. I adored every second of listening to this book and did extra chores all day so I would have an excuse to listen for hours. The writing was also exceptional. I think Rainbow Rowell really gets my demographic. The two books that I've read from her so far have both been adult books and they were both written with my generation in mind. I get all the pop culture references, I get the sources of stress and angst, I get it all. I honestly didn't read the blurb before starting this book, only adding it to my to-read list based on the strength of \"Attachments\". I was surprised as hell when this book became magical realism on me. It is very low fantasy, but it's there and I loved the light fantasy of this story. This book is mostly kind of depressing, to be honest. It is about discovering when and how a relationship can go wrong. It is a journey of reflection, of the ways we can unravel and be forced to reanalyze our lives. It was pretty touching for me, and I gave my husband extra kisses after finishing. Though this book is dealing with a fairly serious topic, it is also, at the same time, really light. It is often funny and clever, mixing humor and ridiculous situations with the more angsty moments. I found the balance to be really well executed. My only wish is that we find out if Georgie and Neal ever talked about that time with the magical phone. I also kind of was mad at Neal for not trying to get in touch more, but he is kind of like that (I feel like I know him personally) so I guess I understand. The ending was a touch anticlimactic, but still pretty epic in a romantic holiday movie kind of way. If you want a really special audio experience, you must give this a shot.

Like the author came up with a great idea for a book but wasn't able to write down a story up to the standards of that idea.That's what I feel that happened with 'Landline'. The idea that somebody in the present could talk with someone from the past over a landline phone sounds really interesting. The way Rowell spun her story around this idea was not so.A thirty seven year-old woman named Georgie McCool chooses her work as a sitcom writer (or whatever Georgie does for a living) over spending Christmas in Omaha with her husband Neal and their two daughters Alice and Noomi (whose real name is actually Naomi). As a matter of fact, Georgie always chooses her work over everything else. And Neal just drags along, without saying anything. He is the stay-at-home dad and Georgie spends her life working. But it's Christmas, they are supposed to go to Omaha and Neal boards the plane with his daughters, leaving Georgie in sunny California with her work. Then, as Georgia starts realising Neal is not even calling her and that might mean he's upset with her, she decides to make a move and calls him. Only to discover that getting in touch with her husband via mobile phone is quite impossible. So she moves to her old yellow rotary phone, the one she used to use as a young woman, in her mother's house. Back when she was dating Neal. And Georgie is able to get in touch with her husband, only that the Neal on the other side on the line isn't the actual Neal. He is the Neal from 1998, the Neal Georgie dated back then. Her boyfriend Neal. And so it follows a series of over-the-phone between actual Georgie and 1998 Neal, while Georgie tries to understand what is the meaning of all that and what is she supposed to do to fix the present situation.Boring. This book is boring. And I liked the idea. But I didn't like Georgie, I couldn't feel sorry for her, and what's with those over-the-phone conversations?! I couldn't care for them, especially because they didn't bring any insight to the story. In the end, Georgie understands what she has to do. But, duh!, was there any need for those conversations with Neal from the past? I found them completely useless and confusing. Especially given the rushed-up end.And Neal... Is he supposed to be a likeable character? A man that seldom smiles? A man who has this weird laugh? A huff? Is that supposed to be cute? And all that talk about his dimples. Gosh! Neal has dimples but doesn't smile. Great. Every woman dream guy.Another this that irked me what the way Rainbow Rowell got her characters, especially Georgie, to talk. Great for a YA story, but not so great for a thirty seven year old woman to talk. Because Georgie talked like that. She even used \"like\" in the middle of her sentences. It's kind of creepy. It's something I can tolerate in YA, but not in a story with adult characters, who are older than me.And is 'Landline' supposed to be a book about the management of a crumbling-to-pieces marriage? Because nothing really happens in that direction. Georgie spends the time whining about the situation of her marriage and talking on the phone with her boyfriend from 1998. And Neal, truthful to himself, just stays in Omaha. He does nothing. There is virtually no talk between Georgie and Neal about what they are going through. And when I say \"Georgie and Neal\", I mean \"Georgie and Neal\" from the present. That doesn't happen and it made me feel like this book was a waste of words.Which is a shame. I like Rowell's writing and this could've been such a great book."}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "3.5 starsAs always, Rainbow created another great, realistic cast of characters.

Georgie McCool is at the peak of her TV writing career with the news of the one show she and her best friend, Seth, had been dreaming about since they first started working together right out of college. It\u2019s everything she\u2019s ever wanted. The only problem is, she\u2019d have to skip the family Christmas vacation to Omaha that\u2019s been planned weeks in advanced. Neal, being the kind and loving husband that he is, doesn\u2019t push her, but is visibly upset that Georgie considers staying behind in California, spending Christmas away from him and their girls. But what can she do? It really is the big break she\u2019s been waiting for, the chance of a lifetime. But is it worth it?While separated from her husband and children, Georgie contemplates her marriage and how she and Neal went from deeply in love to a shockingly tense relationship. Through the help of a \u201cmagical fucking phone\u201d\u2014as Georgie calls it\u2014she\u2019s able to communicate with Neal from the past before they were even engaged. I was fascinated by this premise and was anxious to get my hands on a phone like that. Alas, Target does not sell it.On the surface, Landline would appear to be a romance novel with science fictional elements added thanks to the magical phone, but it\u2019s really way more than that, but also none of that at the same time. It takes a deeper look at the age old saying: Sometimes love just isn\u2019t enough. In essence, that\u2019s what Georgie relied on to keep her marriage together for so long until she realized it was falling apart. Can love really endure all things?\n\t\t\"We're not broken up.\"\t\t\"I know, but we're still broken.\"\nMuch of the novel centers around a delicate balance of past and present narration, from Georgie. We learn how they met, we see them fall in love, we root for them before we understand why their marriage lost its spark. This sort of narration can be tricky and convoluted if it feels choppy. However, Rowell pulls this off very well and weaves it around the magical phone conversations with Past Neal. It\u2019s entirely relevant and without the past narration, we\u2019d never really get a sense of this Past Neal because he is very much a separate character from Present Neal. In fact, in the end, we get better picture of Past Neal than Present.Past Georgie is just fascinating and relatable. At the time she marries Neal, she\u2019s in her early 20s and feels like everything will work out because she has this deep love for her husband and he for her. She would have never imagined them ever falling to pieces because they were perfect for each other. But that\u2019s really where Rowell succeeds with her character arc. When you\u2019re young and you think you have forever, you don\u2019t think about all the possible ways things will break.\n\t\t\"You don't know when you are twenty-three. You don\u2019t know what it really means to crawl into someone else\u2019s life and stay there. You can\u2019t see all the ways you\u2019re going to get tangled, how you\u2019re going to bond skin to skin. How the idea of separating will feel in five years, in ten\u2014in fifteen. When Georgie thought about divorce now, she imagined lying side by side with Neal on two operating tables while a team of doctors tried to unthread their vascular systems.\"\nRowell has a way of speaking to your soul and it singing back without you knowing it at first. Even though I personally haven\u2019t been a huge fan of her writing in the past, Landline did grab me and jerk a few tears from my eyes. When Georgie started to really rethink her choice of staying behind, I connected with her more. I understood her conflicted feelings of wanting love to be the cure-all for her marital issues. I felt for her deep affection of Neal despite her not understanding how to fix the problem. She struggles with the knowledge of knowing much of the problem is her, that she\u2019s been selfish and not considerate enough to Neal over the years. It\u2019s very self-depreciating for Georgie and she spends most of her conversations with Past Neal trying to convince him to never propose to her in the first place.I really appreciate how Rowell just seems to get relationships and how she manages to create such interesting dynamics. Georgie and her best friend, Seth, with their witty banter and easy conversation, was entertaining and held all the signature Rainbow Rowell humor fans have grown to love and expect from her novels (especially the 80s references because it wouldn\u2019t be a Rainbow Rowell novel without them!). Georgie and her two girls had the most adorable scenes, with her youngest insisting on Georgie saying goodbye by meowing. It was little quirky things like this that brought a smile to my face and made the side characters feel just as real and developed as the main ones.If there is one thing I could complain about with Landline, is the \u201cmagical fucking phone.\u201d I really wanted more from it. I expected Rowell to explore the reasons behind the time traveling, but there wasn\u2019t any. By the end of the novel, the focus remained on Georgie and Neal\u2019s relationship and it left behind more questions than answers. While the phone does play a large part in the book, it\u2019s always just a passing thought for Georgie. She does think about the mechanics behind it a few times, but it\u2019s brief and didn\u2019t satisfy my curiosity. How did it work? What were the consequences of the space time continuum for using this phone? Did Neal really know about the phone? Does Georgie\u2019s family home hold any other super powered 80s magical devices? Did the Doctor create the magical phone?! Am I thinking about this too hard?!Overall, Landline is a solid novel about what happens to a relationship when you are well past the infatuation, past the first years of marriage and into a barren territory you never thought you\u2019d be in. How do you find your way back to the oasis and why can\u2019t love save you? If you were hoping this was Rowell mixing her quirky contemporary with a bit of science fiction, you may be underwhelmed on that notion. However, I wouldn\u2019t discount it because of that. It\u2019s not what I was expecting, that\u2019s for sure, but I wasn\u2019t disappointed with what I found in its place.Review originally appeared on Tor.com.Audiobook was provided by the publisher via Book Expo America."}, {"userName": "Dana Kenedy (Dana and the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/372001-dana-kenedy-dana-and-the-books", "userReview": "I found it to be pretty boring all the way through :("}, {"userName": "Sarah (Starry Night Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7883731-sarah-starry-night-reader", "userReview": "Hmmm.. I have mixed feelings about this book. It's basically everything I feared when I thought of Rainbow Rowell's books as fluffy romance novels, but I do think it delivered an insightful and important message. Also, this is probably the perfect book to read as the holidays approach, as it gives you those warm and fuzzy I'm-so-thankful-for-everyone-in-my-life feelings.The main character, Georgie McCool, begins to reflect on the problems and nature of her marriage when her husband Neal takes their children to Omaha for Christmas without her. When she discovers her old landline phone is somehow magically connecting her to Neal in the past, she is compelled to consider the decisions she and Neal made when she was 23-ish? and their consequences. But to be honest, about halfway through I found myself asking when something was actually going to happen in this story..I mostly read young adult novels, and I think this book was intended for an older audience (the type with husbands and children). However, having been in a relationship for seven years, I could relate to this story. When I reflect on the decisions I made when I was 20 years old, I realize how little I understood about what my decisions really meant and the impact they would eventually have on my life.\n\u201cYou don't know when you're twenty-three.You don't know what it really means to crawl into someone else's life and stay there. You can't see all the ways you're going to get tangled, how you're going to bond skin to skin. How the idea of separating will feel in five years, in ten - in fifteen. When Georgie thought about divorce now, she imagined lying side by side with Neal on two operating tables while a team of doctors tried to unthread their vascular systems.She didn't know at twenty-three.\u201d\nSeven years later, I'm (thankfully, happily) still with the man of my dreams but it definitely hasn't always been easy. In fact, we were recently joking (as his 30th birthday approaches in two weeks) about how we've basically grown up together, figured out where we fit in the world together, and sometimes questioned if each of us can even live the life we want together...\n\u201cNobody's lives just fit together. Fitting together is something you work at. It's something you make happen - because you love each other.\u201d\nI found this to be really honest and accurate. Too often, love and romantic relationships are portrayed as something that come so easily when you find \"the one\" or \"my soulmate\" or it's just \"meant to be happily ever after\" when in reality relationships require a lot of work and active maintenance. I really enjoy RR's writing style, but this was a little too much of cheesy predictable love story for me. even though I wasn't a huge fan of this book, it was overall an enjoyable read and I absolutely loved Fangirl, so I still can't wait to get my hands on RR's other books."}, {"userName": "Katrina Passick Lumsden", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1964146-katrina-passick-lumsden", "userReview": "Gah.

I suppose it's to be expected considering we are living in the age of the overwrought cliche and the weird sex-type-thing.I'll admit I wasn't as excited about Landline as I was about Rowell's other books, so color me genuinely surprised when I liked this one as much as I did. Her dialogue is stellar, and I always manage to find myself amazed at how easy it is. How natural and real and flowing. People do speak to each other this way, and it's refreshing to read a story where I'm not rolling my eyes every other page and thinking, \"Who says shit like that out loud?!\"I'll also admit that the main reason I wasn't that enthused about this book was because the premise made me think there wasn't going to be any of the thrills of a budding new relationship. The main character is already married, and has been for like, 16 years. She and her husband, Neal, have two children together. She's a comedy writer for a television sitcom and he's a stay-at-home dad. And they're having some serious problems. The reader is treated to both sides of their relationship; the emotionally painful current issues and the heart-wrenchingly sweet and adorable moments when they first fell in love. Starting out, you don't know where this is going to go. You get an immediate sense that Neal might be kind of an asshole, but in true Rowell style, he's just a regular dude with a few issues. The amazing thing about Rowell's characterization is that Neal managed to make me swoon even though he's not the kind of guy I could ever find myself falling for. That's rare. Also, while I found Georgie to be unbelievably selfish, I still rooted for her. I still cared about her even as I fantasized about beating her with her damned rotary phone.
