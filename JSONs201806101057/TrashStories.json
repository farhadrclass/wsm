It is filled with stories. Some stories of brutality that you pray you will never experience and some about the strength of families that you might look for, even hope for.My first book by Dorothy Allison was Bastard Out of Carolina. I gave it five stars http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25... and wanted to read more. It took me six months to pick up the next book. I picked Trash because I like short stories and it is one of Allison\u2019s first published books, maybe the first. I liked Dorothy right away. It was hard for me not to like a lesbian author who writes freely and proudly about her lesbian life. And there is plenty of that in Trash. If you want to read her, get used to her being in your face! There was a day in my life when I decided to live. After my childhood, after all that long terrible struggle to simply survive, to escape my stepfather, uncles, speeding Pontiacs, broken glass and rotten floorboards, or that inevitable death by misadventure that claimed so many of my cousins; after watching so many die around me, I had not imagined that I would ever need to make such a choice. I had imagined the hunger for life in me was insatiable, endless, unshakable. After experiencing some of what is called life, Dorothy said, \u201cI began to dream longingly of my own death.\u201d Thus Trash begins and Allison\u2019s writing career gets off to a shaky start.The first pages after the preface are called River of Names. Story after story of unspeakable physical and verbal violence against children and babies. You cannot believe anyone could do what is told. But the storyteller Dorothy says, \u201cBut I lie.\u201d You have to believe her because what she says could not be true.But there is also humor. I do not lie. Here is an example of a joke: What\u2019s a South Carolina virgin?\u2018At\u2019s a ten-year-old can run fast. Laughing yet?Actually, the story I\u2019m Working on My Charm about waitressing is funny. I thought so anyway. And the story Steal Away about shoplifting through college is another one where I have to ask, \u2018Fact or Fiction?\u2019 But you have to hope that you have left the shear brutality behind.As is true with many short story collections, some have appeared in print publications previously. And some appear in her books subsequently. For me they accommodate re-reading quite nicely.I am not sure why I am focused on the truth or fiction of the writing. The truth may be that her writing is autobiographical but leans a little away from the truth. Some of her books are listed as non-fiction and some as fiction. I don\u2019t know who decided that. But she does come to the question of lies regularly. Here is an exchange with Toni, one of her more than several lovers that we meet in the book. \u201cKeeping your eyes down and your voice so soft. Wearing those silly-assed sandals and damn-fool embroidered denim blouses. Always telling those drawling lies about all your cousins, and granddaddies, and uncles\u2026\u201d\u201cThey ain\u2019t lies.\u201d\u201cThen they should be.\u201d Some criticize her for writing that apparently condones the promiscuity of her life. Maybe it is just serial monogamy as a result of the number of years of change and alert flirting.Dorothy Allison makes fun of Southern writers.Toni pulled a library book out of her backpack and tossed it in my direction. \u201cOr Flannery O\u2019Connor. This one\u2019s just like you, honey. She\u2019d have given you a vision of Jesus with monkey\u2019s blood. She\u2019d have had you chop off your own fingers and feed them to the monkey.\u201d Toni hugged her pack to her ribs and rocked with giggles.\u201cShit girl, it\u2019s just too much, too Southern Gothic \u2013 catfish and monkeys and chewed-off fingers. Throw in a little red dirt and chicken feathers, a little incest and shotgun shells, and you could join the literary tradition.\u201d Toni goes on to dissect Allison\u2019s own writing and storytelling in a way that lets us know what Allison thinks about her own writing. The story Monkeybites is a ranting self analysis given as a lovers\u2019 quarrel between two women. It is powerful. There is no doubt that Dorothy Allison is putting herself out there for us to see. This book is from twenty-five years ago. It is from a time when lesbians were coming out more frequently and with fewer apologies. Dorothy Allison is one of those. This book strongly reflects her lesbianism. The Helen Reddy 1972 song, \u201cI am Woman, hear me roar\u201d predates Allison by a decade but its words describe her and the many others coming out in the 80s. \u201cI am invincible.\u201dThis book starts out so intense it is hard to imagine how it could sustain that level for the entire book. I think it is actually good to say that the intensity does back off after the first couple of chapters but it easily maintains its level as an excellent work. Now I have read two Dorothy Allison books and rated both five stars. I think I will move on to another of her books to see if she holds her high quality.Oh, and get ready to learn Dorothy\u2019s version of lesbian life. She says she been part of it since she was seventeen. She was born in 1949 so it seems she came out in the mid60s. You could say she had a rough early life and you can read about it in her writing. Let me not end this without saying the obvious: she is a feminist as well as considering herself a femme. I want to know more about her. Her work is autobiographical while still leaving some questions of \u201cfact or fiction?\u201d There does not seem to be a biography about her yet. Maybe after reading all her writing there is not much left to say.One last thing before I let you go. If Dorothy Allison is ever to put together a cook book, it will be a Lesbian Cook Book. It\u2019s true. The diet of poor Southerners is among the worst in the world, though it\u2019s tasty, very tasty. There\u2019s pork fat or chicken grease in every dish, white sugar in the cobblers, pralines, and fudge, and flour, fat, and salt in the gravies \u2013 lots of salt in everything. The vegetables got cooked to limp strands with no fiber left at all. Mothers give sidemeat to their toddlers as pacifiers and slip them whiskey with honey at the first sign of teething, a cold, or a fever. Most of my cousins lost their teeth in their twenties and took up drinking as early as they put sugar in their iced tea. I try not to eat so much sugar, try not to drink, try to limit pork and salt and white flour, but the truth is I am always hungry for it \u2013 the smell and taste of the food my mama fed me. Go read some Dorothy Allison! I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do, as perverted as that may sound. You will read some great stories about lesbian sex. Now I\u2019m done!"}, {"userName": "Amory Blaine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52957-amory-blaine", "userReview": "\"We are under so many illusions about our powers...illusions that vary with the moon, the mood, the moment.

I was confident it was a two-night read, but the gritty, harnessed prose slowed me up and caused it to take about a week. When you read one of Allison\u2019s stories, it takes time to digest. As a reader I was encouraged to dissect each one, but felt as if the job had already been done for me intentionally. Digging for the deeper meaning seems entirely against Allison\u2019s intention, but at the same time is gut-wrenchingly necessary.

I\u2019ve shaken her hand and seen/heard her speak at Squaw Valley and at Tin House, though, and I\u2019ve read enough of her work to know that she is one rare package of compassion, humor, and bitterness. Trash is full of early stories, stories from what she calls her \u201cyellow pages\u201din the forward, those pages being a legal pad on which she originally scribbled down recollections of her childhood with no thought of publication. She\u2019d go back home to the motel where the war on poverty government put her up while she was in training for a position with the Social Security administration. There, with time on her hands and no money to go out, she\u2019d write. Later on, she rewrote, then rewrote again. And, I guess, again. Then there were some stories added on, and what we end up with is a series of stories (\u201clinked\u201d as they like to say now.) about growing up in a particular house in a particular community that the world labeled as garbage. Allison is not on a mission to sentimentalize or excuse her people--or herself. Most of her cousins, she says, were dead or drunk or pregnant or toothless at a young age. \u2018There were so many we were without number and, like tadpoles, if there was one less from time to time, who counted? My maternal great-grandmother had six sons, five daughters. Each one made at least six. Some made nine. Six times six, eleven times nine. They went on like multiplication tables. They died and were not missed.\u201d She herself was the victim of a molesting and physically abusive stepfather whom her mother (who had her while unmarried at fifteen) couldn\u2019t quite figure out how to leave. Though she doesn\u2019t gloss over the uglies, she writes with great passion about the virtues, makes vicious (and well-deserved) fun of writers and others who deign to judge, to pretend they know what it\u2019s like to grow up poor in Greenville, NC because they\u2019ve read a little Faulkner or Flannery O\u2019Connor. Allison uses \u201ctrash\u201d to define herself in the defiant way that black people us \u201cNigger\u201d and gays use \u201cQueer.\u201d We can call each other that name, but you better not. In truth, we have no other literary voice that I know of from Allison\u2019s people. Neither Faulkner nor O\u2019Connor, as effectively as they wrote about the south, came from the redneck poor life and folks from which Allison escaped. And neither of them was (at least openly) gay. And Allison is not only open, but fierce about it. These stories are autobiographical, but they are not memoir. They stand as true pieces of fiction, and you can\u2019t tell which is the biography and which is the made up. \u201cGospel Song,\u201d is a good example, the story of her albino friend with parents who run a gospel singing troupe. Whether or not there really was a Shannon Pearl in Allison\u2019s life, her friendship with another outcast becomes a true symbol of what it means to live reviled and rejected. And the closing story, \u201cCompassion,\u201d about her mother\u2019s death is as touching a piece of prose as you\u2019ll ever read. Love and cruelty nestled side by side. Almost operatic. If you\u2019re looking for booze, sex, and pot, you\u2019ll find plenty of that in Trash as well. But what you\u2019ll find mostly is well-crafted, deeply true and wrenching stories drawn directly from a worlds you can barely imagine."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4625795-andrea", "userReview": "This is one that I initially read in a writing workshop class in college; my copy ended up going home with a roommate, but the stories stuck with me anyway. It recently popped into my head again, and of course the library had a copy, so I decided it was time for a re-read.In short, it's a fantastic collection. The stories are hard and unsentimental, often violent and sometimes horrifying, but also surprisingly beautiful at times. Nothing is presented about how things ought to be; it is simply how they are. The tactile details, the voices of each character, the rough desperation, rage, and stubborn acceptance are immediate, immersive, and real. The stories are short, and it's quick to simply read all the words on the page, but each story demands reflection and digestion. It's not an easy read, but well-worth the effort."}, {"userName": "Matt  ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/909857-matt", "userReview": "This is powerful, intense, moving writing. The introduction alone is a stunning piece of work, describing the author's decision \"to live\" and to write her stories. It is a testament to the power the creation of literature has to save and sustain a life. The standard frequenty cited to determine whether or not someone is a \"real writer\" is whether or not that person would write if they knew no one would ever read their work. In Dorothy Allison's case, the choice between writing and not writing is presented as a literal choice between life and death. I believe we can confidently call Dorothy Allison a \"real writer\".

To join the conversation.\" \u2014 Dorothy Allison (Trash) \"I did not imagine anyone reading my rambling, ranting stories. I was writing for myself, trying to shape my life outside my terrors and helplessness, to make it visible and real in a tangible way, in the way other people's seemed real -- the lives I had read about in books.\" \u2014 Dorothy Allison (Trash) \"I did things I did not understand for reasons I could not begin to explain just to be in motion, to be trying to do something, change something in a world I wanted desperately to make over but could not imagine for myself.\" \u2014 Dorothy Allison (Trash) \"When my mama was twenty-five she already had an old woman's hands, and I feared them. I did not know then what it was that scared me so. I've come to understand since that it was the thought of her growing old, of her dying and leaving me alone.

But soon Allison's brilliant writing won me over, and I couldn't stop -- because beyond all my inhibitions, her stories made me hungry. This collection is of the sort of visceral prose that shakes its musty scent over everything -- that renders the reader yearning, turned on, repulsed, through it all, wanting more. Allison's hunger, longing, the dislocated desire of young adulthood hold these stories together. \"A Lesbian Appetite\" literally makes the easy connection between sex and appetite - and in it Allison crafts visceral, intense scenes which blur the boundaries of sex and desire and food and family and home. Other stories in Trash pose the question of hunger (read: desire) more subtly: \"Muscles of the Mind\" explores the trials of friendship, \"Demon Lover\" looks at a lover who won't leave, even in death, and \"Compassion\" makes peace with endings. I felt especially grateful for Allison's refusal to employ the easy fundamentalist slogans of politics. She writes freely on her involvement in women's groups and political movements, but doesn't dwell dogmatically in moral territory. Another author might use this type of subject matter -- violence, poverty, sexuality, discrimination -- to drill home carefully formulated party lines, but Allison doesn't preach. Her writing is raw, frantic, present -- a painful shrug toward what it means to be a person."}, {"userName": "Dr. Sharada", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4384652-dr-sharada", "userReview": "Most short story collections, if not all, I've read before contained stories that differed from each other in terms of characters, narrator, and setting. All the stories in Trash are told in Allison's semi-(or more accurately nearly-?)autobiographical voice but they differ in when they happen, where she is and as a result, *who* she is. It was very interesting to see just how different that narrative voice could be, not just as a result of different times or places, but also because of the multi-faceted nature of human beings, and at the same time feel like the same person I'd been getting to know in the course of the book. Because Allison comes from a poor family in the south, many of the elements were familiar to me from my own life or from the stories my mother has told. Sometimes they were too sad and too close to home. Yet, there were a couple of times I really felt like I didn't know what was going on, perhaps it was because I was sleepy when reading. Those two or three stories were more like a set of paragraph-length vignettes that related to each other in some way or other, like vivid snatches of memory sharing some common and maybe tenuous element put together under a single story title.

There are moments when the rawness comes through beautifully, but other times I struggled to follow the story lines. Perhaps they weren't meant to be read as stories. I often found the writing overly informative, rather than descriptive. In other words, it was hard to visualize the surroundings. The voices were so strong, but they seemed to float in space.

For one, this book screams 1980s! And that\u2019s not a bad thing at all, but it does place it pretty firmly in a time and place. Dorothy Allison writes about the SOUTH, like the SOOOOOOOOUTH. And unlike bullshit artists like JD Vance, any politician, and many many male writers, she doesn\u2019t give a shit about your economic anxiety. Her collection is not all that different from Doris Betts in that same way. Guess what\u2019s worse than economic anxiety of white men? Being the women those guys take it out on. And then throw in the mix being an out and unrepentant lesbian, well, this is what you get. The major criticism of this book would be that the stories tend to blend. While that does suggest a narrative cohesiveness that is really attractive, the stories\u2019 borders can blur a little much. There\u2019s also an issue with the variety of length being a little out of balance.But all that is to say that this is a really effective and poignant collection of stories. The inhabitants of Allison\u2019s fiction do not have it easy and do not take it easy. They are living the life handed to them in the best way they can.

It feels like the line between memoir and fiction is blurry in this collection -- and based on the introduction (which alone made the collection worth reading), this is deliberate."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23352366-mary", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this one. I truly loved both the stories and the writing of her two novels. But I didn't click with this book of essays.

The limitless scope of human emotion and experience are depicted in stories that give aching and eloquent voice to the terrible wounds we inflict on those closest to us. These are tales of loss and redemption; of shame and forgiveness; of love and abuse and the healing power of storytelling. A book that resonates with uncompromising candor and incandescence, Trash is sure to captivate Allison's legion of readers and win her a devoted new following.", "title": "Trash: Stories", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91872.Trash", "average": 4.08, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1439909122l/91872.jpg", "reviews": 166, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5599.Dorothy_Allison", "name": "Dorothy Allison"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Glbt", "Lgbt", "American"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91872.Trash", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1136076.Trash", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7142557-trash", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25354.Bastard_Out_of_Carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91873.Two_or_Three_Things_I_Know_for_Sure", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68797.Cavedweller", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91871.Skin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1643980.Bastard_Out_of_Carolina_Two_or_Three_Things_I_Know_For_Sure"]}
