{"ratings": 7, "userreviews": [], "description": "Be prepared to be spooked, but also be prepared to expect the unexpected. These are written to come at you from an entirely unexpected direction. There is more than a touch of the Gothic and macabre about these stories. In fact they are steeped in it. They are flesh-crawlingly delicious, and a treat for devotees of the paranormal. This is a collection of short stories. They are long enough to grip the reader, but brief enough to be read in a tea break or on a train - but why not treat yourself to a good spook-fest, and read them in the comfort of your armchair as the rain patters against the windowpane, and the wind howls its mournful tune - well, you get the idea. Read it wherever you feel most comfortable (or uncomfortable!). Just for good measure, I have also included a handful of stories (and a poem) from other authors who are friends of mine. You will find these scattered throughout the book at random intervals. So if you see the story title, and then a name, this will be a story from one of my friends, so watch out for Bernie Morris, David Clarke, Ann Perry and Lesley Hanson.
