It was not compelling, nor a page turner, but it was a pleasant place to go for a little break. Then, one day, I got busy and stopped. I didn't feel a great loss.Reading this is very much just like sitting on a bench in a small town and watching the people live their ordinary lives around you. Which I think was what was intended and is pleasant in that aim.Many people did not enjoy or continue this book, and I agree, there is nothing \"great\" about it, and I clearly left it sitting for a very long time, but these last few days when I picked it back up, determined to finish, that quiet, observational time on a bench in rural NC was just what I needed.It is funny without being overt and it exposes ignorance, faith, hypocrisy, and a certain sweetness, all through anecdotal vignettes. There is a central story-line, but it is not aggressive.I read another Edgerton book a long time ago, Raney, and that one was pretty obviously humorous. This one is much more laid back and subtle, which is nice it its own way.I'm glad to have read it, but I won't be recommending it much."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143983-louise", "userReview": "Pretty good novel.From back cover:\"Here, evil comes to sleepy Listre, N.C., circa 1950, in the form of a stranger with a pencil-thin mustache and a trunkful of dirty movies.

I enjoyed that it was set in the late 40s and that it was a close rural community where a drifting criminal came to prey. However, what I didn't like about it was the amount of religion. I get that these people are religious, yet as a reader, I don't need to peruse sermons and prayers and constant reverence to a deity on every other page. There was so much that I felt it got in the way of the story and found myself rolling my eyes. At times, the characters were so pious that my teeth ached. Also, there were sections (narrower-margin text) of scenes of other characters in the community that didn't really tie into the main story. If these other characters were somehow entwined in the main plot, this mechanism would've been great. Unfortunately, I got the impression most of these were added to give verisimilitude of small-town flair."}, {"userName": "Dox", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2608235-dox", "userReview": "A stranger comes to Listre, looking to see what he can shake out for his own profit. In the meantime, the people in the little town are living their lives. Mainly the story is told from the perspective of a six year old boy who spends a lot of time observing his world.The best thing about this book was the interview put in as an extra where the author \"interviews\" his slick, trouble-making character, Jack Umstead. Otherwise, the book was generally easy to read, had enough dialect to feel genuine but not so much as to annoy the reader, but overall felt slow and uninteresting. These are characters working hard to maintain their existence, and they have histories and backgrounds, but they mostly amount to mildly interesting. The plot is rather thin; this is more of a novel about a place and the people in it."}, {"userName": "Marguerite", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1038238-marguerite", "userReview": "Small-town North Carolina meets a bad apple who's out to seduce the town's women and rob everyone else, even the Baptist church. Does Listre stand a chance? Clyde Edgerton's hamlet is drawn with love and humor. In Listre, everyone knows everyone else's bidness, from the shotgun-toting old maid to the preacher who sins in his heart to the dog that forecasts the weather. Without giving anything away, I'll just note that small town doesn't mean simple-minded. The characters in Where Trouble Sleeps are folks you don't mind spending time with. Their accents are the real deal. I didn't notice any kudzu, but the geography rang true. And, the pace of the novel is just right: I sped through this like I've hastened through many a burg in North Carolina."}, {"userName": "Cody", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/934807-cody", "userReview": "I love Clyde Edgerton but this book lacked the humor of RANEY or WALKING ACROSS EGYPT.

This time, Listre, North Carolina, seemed peopled with only weirdos, not one of whom I could relate to or completely understand.

The story was ok. The writing was ok. The characters were ok. And that's about it--ok. I kept feeling that Edgerton wasn't all that enthused about it himself, that it was something he just churned out for some particular reason. Or perhaps this is his style?
