You know its not ever going to happen, you aren\u2019t right for each other: but the heart wants what the heart wants. Well, that is the love story, or should I say stories, in Love & Ordinary Creatures. It is told from a bird\u2019s point of view, a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo named Caruso, who is tail over wings in love with Clarissa his beautiful red headed care taker. She is his everything, and he wants the happily-ever-after for just the two of them, and then Joe surfs into her life and that green-eyed monster jealousy ruins everything.Clarissa and Caruso live on Ocracoke Island off the shore of North Carolina, in a cottage by the restaurant where Clarissa is the head chef; so food and cooking are other elements in this gorgeous, descriptive novel. The author has done a great job of taping into something primal here; she brings up all types of emotions and has created a believable character in Caruso\u2026especially if you\u2019ve ever loved birds. Definitely 5 stars\u2026"}, {"userName": "olga-maria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12287448-olga-maria", "userReview": "this novel is breathtakingly beautifully written. it grabbed me from the opening line. the concept is stunningly original--narration from a parrot who's in love with his owner. the owner seems little more than a typical rom-com heroine, but the extraordinary narrator elevates this novel right away, as does rubio's exquisite use of language.caruso, the cockatoo, is a terrifically reliable narrator, because he has an eidetic memory, and he is constantly relating not only the present-moment action in the outer banks, but his memories of his previous owner, who taught him about love, and memories of his life in the wilds of australia, where he was captured.did i mention it was breathtaking?"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2322503-linda", "userReview": "I originally gave two stars, but after listening to some of the intelligent, thoughtful comments of my book discussion group friends, my opinion changed somewhat.

It's no Marley and Me, Incredible Journey, or any of the movies and books that claim to be from the point of view of a pet -- at least not from the point of view of the parrot in this book. It's not a \"One day I hope to be the person my dog thinks I am\", either, as the humans involved vastly underestimate the thought process and intelligence of the particular bird involved. From the human viewpoint, it was a whole lot less complex, but the reader is only treated to that p.o.v. via overheard conversations between human characters. Caruso is one of the most passionate central characters to grace the pages between book covers in a while. That he happens to be a parrot doesn't lessen the intensity of the story. Set on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, in the 1990's, Caruso's world is centered on Clarissa, with whom he now lives, and who he loves desperately. He learned about love, albeit obsessive love, from his previous owner, whose heart never relinquished its hold on a childhood sweetheart, loved and lost. How this translates into the obsessive love Caruso carries for Clarissa, how his world shakes and tilts when Clarissa begins a relationship with a man, and how life resolves it all play out a large part of the book. Another another piece of the book intermingles descriptions of Caruso's memories of life in the wild, the world he was snatched from at a tender age, giving the story a different depth.There were parts of this book that just grabbed me by the attention horns, and wouldn't let go -- until they did let go, and I found my mind wandering until the next phrase, or scene, or glimmering thought grabbed me again. This is a deeply passionate story. I've rounded up to a 4/5 star because of those moments that caught me in a snare. Thank you LibraryThing and Ashland Creek Press for sending a copy along to me."}, {"userName": "Sarah Scott", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34823756-sarah-scott", "userReview": "I'm always a sucker for stories with animals, so when I read the description for this book on LibraryThing Early Reviewers, I had to request it. Told through the eyes of the cockatoo Caruso, Love & Ordinary Creatures is about an intelligent young bird who has an intense, emotional attachment to his owner, Clarissa. His world is turned upside down when a new man enters Clarissa's life, and Caruso has to adjust as he learns that the love of his life doesn't feel the same for him.I certainly enjoyed the book. I especially liked reading the \"flashback\" scenes, particularly in regards to Caruso's previous owner - the reader is intended to draw a parallel between Pinter's obsessive love for Olivia, and Caruso's behavior towards Clarissa - which I liked reading. There were also a few shocking surprises, which I won't give away for the future reader - but definitely tender moments that both surprised and moved me. All in all, a wonderful story that I would recommend to any of those who prefer unique, multidimensional love stories.Keep in mind Caruso is extremely intelligent - I'm fairly certain this cockatoo narrator has a better vocabulary than I do. He is a complex creature that provides thought-provoking ideas on love and the meaning of life. Although it did take me a chapter or two to get into it, I appreciate that Rubio wrote Caruso as such an enlightened character - this book is so much more about the bigger picture/main message than the storyline. I will say there were definitely times when I found myself skimming some of Rubio's more philosophical passages on love - but for the right reader, they would certainly be enjoyed. She also has a lovely way of writing - you can't help but enjoy her prose."}, {"userName": "World Literature Today", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6289911-world-literature-today", "userReview": "This book was featured in the Nota Benes section of the January/February 2015 issue of World Literature Today Magazine.http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2..."}, {"userName": "Patti Von", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32908304-patti-von", "userReview": "Just what the heck happened in the next?
