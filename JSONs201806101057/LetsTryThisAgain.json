This is my true and honest review.4.5 stars, and I'm bumping it up to 5 because I am totally blown away by this story, these characters and this author. This is the tale of all of us women and who we were (or are) in our early 20's. It is about falling in love with the wrong guy at the right time or falling in love with the right guy and the wrong time. It is about awkward, painful and full of stupidity life. I think without many exceptions, our main character, Josie, is a part of each of us. It is so real and honest and funny and ugly and painfully truthful. I didn't expect this story to be as emotional as it was for me - both with the laughs and the heartfelt (and heart-hurting) truths it contained."}, {"userName": "Ines", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52574260-ines", "userReview": "[Sometimes I hated Issac and sometimes I loved him (when they had rough sex on the floor, for example). But then Carter came (what old is he? Fourty-something? Thirty-something? He was a star when Josie was a tween, so it was hard to figure out his age). The relationship with Carter was a bit odd. First, she was his PA (but never did anything), then she helps him compose and do the chorus, and... suddenly, she's singing with him and becoming a star. Wasn't he supose to return by himself? Without a band? It's not the same thing being a composer or doing the chorus for someone than being a duet. Josie overthinks everything too much! She loved Isaac, he was a jerk, she hated him but she loved him (ugh!). Then she said she was in love with Carter, but I've never thought she was really in love with Carter, at least not as much as she was with Isaac.

This rom-com (romantic comedy) had me hooked from the beginning of the story. It was hilarious, fun, and sexy. I enjoyed reading it very much. I loved all the references to pop-culture. The mentions of music I grew up listening to, the mention of shows and movies. The writing was superb. I could easily relate to situations. The main character Josie was very easy for me to love. She reminded me a bit of myself when I was younger. Her girlfriends are ride or die kind of chics. I felt like I was reading about my own girlfriends. They were the kind of women that would do anything for their best friend. They were there in the good times and the bad. The story had a lot of sexual naughty moments full of raw sexual passion. These moments weren't overdone. It wasn't drawn out. These moments were kept short and sweet. At times funny and awkward. I loved every moment of it. Reminded me a bit of reading a Jackie Collins novel at times-and I absolutely love her writing. This wasn't all sex, and comedy though. There was also sweet, romantic moments. It was about following your dreams and passions. Trying new things, meeting new people, being brave and seeing where life will take you. If you enjoy reading sexy romantic comedies then this is definitely a fun one that you will not want to miss. It was a very enjoyable read. Never dull or boring. It was full of exciting and adventurous situations. I loved this book and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Sex in the City women, or Bridget Jones. This book was entertaining and very hard to put down. It was indulgent and I savored every bit of it. A perfect Friday or Saturday night read."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "I was in the mood for a good comedy. That is what I thought I was getting with this book. Sadly, I was not laughing. Not even by the half way mark. It was a slow start to this book for me. Yet, I was determined to stick it out and give it a chance. Josie's friends were more fun than she was. She did not give me a good vibe. There was a scene where Josie was trying to show up one of Isaac's exs. Yes, I should be cheering for Josie that she got the upper hand but instead she came off as too catty for my taste. This probably had to do with the fact that I could not understand why Josie was with Isaac or what she saw in him. Despite all of this I thought things would turn around for the better once Josie got to California. It was starting to with Carter but not fast enough.

It is my opinion and it has nothing else to do than with me giving it freely and honestly. Some readers think it's a disrespect to an author to give lower than 3 stars. I can't prevent anyone of being offended by my opinion, but I don't give it offensively or disrespectfully and we're all entitled to our own opinions.That being said, this book was a huge disappointment to me. Not because of how it ends, but because of it as a whole. In my opinion, it could have been better developed and the story could have been more built. Most of the times it felt like it was a report than a story being told, because for me it didn't flow organically.I actualky get what the author was trying to do with the story and how it ended, but for me it didn't work, not because of the \"why\" it ended that way, but because of the \"how\".

The main character is young -- early twenties -- and it helped me to remember that. Let's Try This Again is a book about a young woman developing her identity and the men that are part of that. It's roughly a novel about a woman torn between two men, but when I reflect on it, it seems more about a woman who is young and can't decide what she wants until she does. And then the book ends. There's not a truly happy, ride off into the sunset ending, and I didn't want one for Josie. That's more an observation about her age and immaturity than how much I liked the main character.

The main character Josie, reminded me so much of a friend of mine, it was insane. Josie (the name Josie usually reminds me of that movie, Never Been Kissed, where Drew Barrymore is ugly crying \"I'm not Josie Grossy anymore\" \ud83d\ude02 - but not with this book, don't worry. Josie in this book is golden) had an incredibly rough on and off again relationship with Issac. Issac.. well he's one of those guys that keeps you waiting on your toes. The guy who makes you walk on eggshells spread on a tightrope with a \"maybe if you do this, I won't have to say \"maybe\" to you anymore and leave you hanging. Finally, Josie saw the light and actually told herself to stop walking on that tightrope. So she cut it and let herself swing into a new life, one across the country in California. It was amazing to see her going through this transformation of finding out what she wanted to do, and what she didn't want to do. She had some major bumps in her way, a guy that fell in love with her. A love without expectations or strings. And she found her voice at the end, she found out what she really wanted. All of the characters in this book were great, even Isaac. Carter was so great and I loved how he selflessly loved someone who wasn't quite sure of what kind of love she wanted. Molly and Ellie, Josie's best friends - the kind of friends every girl on the planet needs, were so hilarious and just all around great. I really enjoyed this book, and am so happy to have had the opportunity to read it!

She has had an on again, off again relationship with Isaac for the past forever. Josie and Isaac know every little intricacy of each other and the sex is just wow. Now, on their third break-up, Isaac wants to meet up with Josie for lunch. Interestingly, this is right before Josie plans on moving all the way to L.A. Inevitably, Josie and Isaac agree to be friends with benefits until she moves. In California, Josie is devastated by her separation from Isaac- and his refusal to contact her. When she lands a job as a personal assistant to Carter Coleman, things take a turn for the better. Carter used to be in a popular boy-band, now he is going solo. He has some amazing music written, and Josie's heartache provides the perfect story for his lyrics. Eventually Josie and Carter form more than a coworker bond; but, is Isaac truly out of the picture and is Josie really ready to try this whole relationship thing again?We've all either been there or have had a friend who has been there- just stuck in a toxic relationship. Josie is the definition of today's new adult, confident, adventurous, owning her sexuality but just not clicking in the dating department. Reading about Josie's dating escapades was like reading a friend's diary or reliving some moments from college. I absolutely loved Josie's inner monologue, it was like she was reading my mind in some situations. Serious brownie points were also won when Josie not only got to work for, but be in a relationship with a former boy-band member (extra credit was given for mentioning 'N Sync) . This was my dream, as I'm sure it was with many other women my age. The decision between Isaac and Carter obviously follows Josie throughout the book (for me it was a no brainer) and we are kept in suspense until the very end. I was really happy with her decision, even if I would have chosen differently. Sensuous, sweet and slightly naughty sex scenes were sprinkled in with just enough to keep things spicy, but not so much to take things overboard. So many things Josie said about relationships and being in love resonated with me, especially from that time in my life especially \"...being in love is never the wrong choice because it's not a choice. Either it's your forever or it gets you to what will come next. It's always a step in the right direction.\" Overall, a fresh, raw and pertinent voice in the new adult genre, perfect for a Valentine's weekend read.This book was received for free in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Marilyn R.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40580323-marilyn-r", "userReview": "Let's Try this Again, the first novel by Jordyn Woodtke is aimed at a very specific audience - young, single adults living a night life full of clubbing, drinking, dancing and partying. The description Sex in the CIty meets Bridget Jones is bang on. Alcohol required.Josie moves through life supported by her two unique BFF's Molly and Ellie. She has a former lover - Isaac - that keeps bouncing in and out of her life. The hook he has planted is hard to pull out. Every time she finally begins to move on, he circles back into her life and her bed again - only to waltz out when things start to get serious. Until the next time.Alcohol fueled nights out, random sexual encounters and her girl squad just can't seem to burn this man out of her system, so Josie makes the brave move to LA where she lands a amazing job as an assistant to a celebrity working on his musical comeback. The distance from her former life helps ease the pain of the lost relationship and introduces her to a hidden talent - opening up whole new career (and relationship) possibilities. But it hasn't changed the pattern of her life. Alcohol and bad choices still rear their ugly head. She has decisions to make on love and life that need her to look at things from a fresh perspective. Will she make the right choices?I have to admit I didn't find Josie's struggles funny. They hit me as sad. BUT this is because I am well outside the New Young Adult target marget. I think it will find a very positive reception within this younger audience. If this is your scene, then this book is a must read. The author's strong screenwriter skills are also very evident, meaning the book could easily find it's way adapted to the big screen - another addition to the sex, rock &roll, New Adult Genre."}, {"userName": "Carla", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36228194-carla", "userReview": "Oh my goodness - Let's Try This Again is hilarious, honest, emotional and full of hope. We have Josie, who is like your best friend. The one you love with all your heart but who makes the same bad decisions over and over again. You want nothing more than the absolute best for her but can't help her when she makes the same decisions over and over again (like going back to the bad ex-boyfriend who makes her feel used and unloved). You just have to be there for them with the ice cream and wine. And that's what her friends do in this hilarious novel.Just when you think she can't make any more bad decisions when it comes to her ex, Josie decides to move to California. Some of this was to make him jealous and another part for a fresh start for her. This is when it gets really steamy (and a tad bit confusing and fun!). She meets her teenage crush, Carter, and actually begins to work for him. This slowly becomes a little bit more until a romance emerges. A huge part of me kept rooting for her and Carter - he seemed so perfect for her! But she feels conflicted every step of the way. Carter and Isaac. And then back again.This novel was awesome - fun, sexy and felt like a conversation with your best friend. Hearing it described as Sex in the City meets Bridget Jones Diary is the exact way I would describe it.

It was one of those reads for me where it wrapped up nicely yet I didn't want it to finish. I'm relatively new (again) at reading romances but, this romantic comedy was right up my alley. I thought it was cool and fun how the author tossed in references to not only music I know, but to pop-culture of our world into her fictitious book. I think it also brought another element of relatableness for her characters to the readers. Josie (main character) and her girlfriends are the kind of friends most (if not all) girls and women want and need in their life- the-ride-or-die-I'm-with-you-to-the-end- kind of friends. A real comradery. Be warned though, this book does have raw sexual tensions and situations that some may not be comfortable with. However, the story isn't about the sex scenes if you're worried about that; however, I do see their necessity to the story.
