She said it did. So 5* it is.I picked this book up from Celyn's pile when we went off on her school trip (a week in the wilds) and being in a hurry I managed to get book 3 of the series rather than book 2 (we read book 1 last year). So we've jumped over The Sea of Monsters - but I don't think the reading experience suffered for it.The short version is: if you enjoyed The Lightning Thief then you'll enjoy this one too. The book is written in the same vein as the first, mining the Greek myths for monsters and plot, and mixing in an American road trip along with Percy's irreverent observations.We don't get much of Annabeth in the book as she's a prisoner for a lot if it. We get lots of Thalia (Zeus' daughter), a fair dose of Grover (a Pan-hunting satyr), and a lot of Zoe Nightshade (one of Artemis' hunting posse). A lot of the book is spent travelling by varied means from one side of the States to the other, a journey punctuated by encounters with monsters. We're set up for a big boss-battle on the Mountain of Despair and that's a fun battle with everything from gods and titans to dragons and bi-planes. All in all an action-packed book to which Celyn was happy to return at every opportunity. And if some of the Greek myths stick with her ... all to the good!Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes.."}, {"userName": "Cara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1876075-cara", "userReview": "I have yet to be disappointed in this series. A real rarity in a fantasy series in general.The story starts out with Percy, Annabeth, and Thalia trying to help Grover to sneak out two half-bloods from a private military style school. Things get immediately messy and they stumble upon yet another problem, or more like a crisis. In the process of a battle Annabeth is stolen away. Something called The General is out again wrecking havoc and as you can already tell Luke has a hand in all this. This time around though you see Luke for what he really is, a kid trying to play with the big boys. We get to see the goddess Artemis and her huntresses. Quite an intriguing bunch, eternal life if you don't fall in love? Kind of harsh, but I guess the price you pay matches your reward. The second in command of the huntresses, Zoe, would have to be my favorite new character. She's prickly but you learn throughout the book why she is the way she is. Bianca and Nico are the new half-bloods and will prove to play important roles in how the plot moves along.It never fails to impress me how the author can intricately put everything into these books. I never feel bored and I love the view he takes on different mythology stories. After reading this book I'll never look at Hercules the same. One of my biggest enjoyments is seeing different American landmarks mentioned in the story, and seeing their odd connection to the Greek myths. You can tell the books are going to take a bit of a darker turn. It makes sense since they all are getting older and the inevitable prophecy is looming over.Always funny, fast-paced, and having hidden fountains of mysteries. I am  SO  ready for more!"}, {"userName": "Reynita Maharani \u2605 The Night Reader \u2605", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43850323-reynita-maharani-the-night-reader", "userReview": "THE REVIEW IS POSTED3.8 Stars THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER\n\n\"There is always a way out for those clever enough to find it.\"\n\nI should've written this review a few days ago but I didn't because I was pretty busy and well, lazy as well hahaha. My first year in university has started since Monday and I have been pretty busy with tasks lately but I'm enjoying my college life! ( so far ) it's so much fun! I'm writing this review on my phone so I will add gifs and the quotes from the book later because I don't have the book with me right now. \nWhat I didn't like\n \ud83d\udc94 To be honest, the whole thing about saving mission is pretty clich\u00e9. In the first book, Percy saved her mom, in the second book, Percy saved Grover and in this book, Percy saved Annabeth and it's pretty clich\u00e9, you know. now I'm wondering what will happen in the fourth book? I'm hoping it won't be like this anymore. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy this book, I did enjoy this book but I just got a little bit bored with this whole saving mission. I just want the three of them together!! Percy, Annabeth and Grover. That's all. Just like the first book. \nMy Opinion\n\u2b50\ufe0f Did I ever tell you how I love the writing style of this series?? The writing style is SO good! It's really funny and the writing style is the first reason I enjoy reading this book. Like how could the author write this perfection?? Seriously, the writing style is so perfect. \n\nThe wind blowing through my ripped clothes was so cold that I felt like a Percysicle.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f NICO DI ANGELO. Look, I'm the last children in my family, so I have always wanted to have a little sister or a little brother and OH MY GOD! NICO IS SO DAMN CUTE! I want him to be my little brother and he needs to be protected at all cost and OH MY GOD. at first I couldn't even guessing who his godly parent was but then when I was half way through the book or nearing the ending, I just had this thought that he might be the son of Hades and I WAS RIGHT and my heart was breaking for him. look, at first, I didn't even believe that Biance died. I just thought that she would somehow survive but then I realized that she died ... and my heart was breaking for Nico. I have a big sister who I love so much and just the thought of losing her scared me so much. \u2b50\ufe0f THIS BOOK WAS SO HILARIOUS. I laughed so much at this scene Grover blushed. \"I was sort of camped outside the Artemis cabin.\"\"What for?\"\"Just to be, you know, near them.\"\"You're a stalker with hooves.\"and they continued talking but I just had to stop reading for a moment because I was laughing so hard. Thankfully, I didn't read that scene in public otherwise I might got funny looks from my friends or anyone but I kind of thought that Grover was kind of strange, you know. why would he camp outside the Artemis cabin? and the reason was just that he wanted to be near them? LOL. Grover is so funny, I like him so much. \u2b50\ufe0f my eyes got a little bit teary when Zo\u00eb died. Why did she have to die?! Zo\u00eb was an interesting character and I wanted to read more about her but she died. why do this always happen to me? every time I started liking certain characters, they either get hurt or die. why have I done to deserve this kind of torment??????? \"Let the world honor you, my Huntress,\" Artemis said. \"Live forever in the stars.\"shit. My eyes are teary again right now. Okay, bye guys, I'm going to go and enjoy this pain. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW.

Ironically, a series that I think is perfect for getting young boys into reading is one that I somehow passed over entirely when I was a kid. Like the previous two entries in the series, there's magic and mayhem and an awful lot of mythology.\u00a0One thing I find so great about this series is the way it serves as a vehicle to inform and educate young readers. Obvious, it offers mythology with its own twist, but it's also informative towards the original stories. Even when things differ for the sake of Percy's adventures there's usually an excuse given in the storytelling. Jam packed with action and sword fights and memorable villains I feel like had I read this as a kid I would have been obsessed with it, right along with Harry Potter.\u00a0I had small issues with this book that brought down my rating a little. Firstly, this one definitely suffers from middle child syndrome. By this point in the series we know the stakes. We know that Percy's going to end up on an adventure that takes him outside Camp Halfblood, and we know that the end goal is seeing him reach his 16th birthday when prophecies abound. This offering in the series raises the stakes in small ways, but in others I felt like it was sort of... useless fluff.\u00a0There are a few new characters introduced in this outing. One of which get unceremoniously dumped from the plot fairly quickly in terms of the entire series - unless they make a surprise return in later books that is - \u00a0and the other I'm sure will be expanded on in books 4 and 5, but here these characters felt almost totally useless. Even the one that might someday return felt wasted. Like they're there one moment and then dumped when the plot called for it.\u00a0Oh, and the Hunters. Artemis has these immortal hunters that follow her around like lackeys, and while I love that idea, I wasn't in love with how blase some characters were about joining her band, when joining means leaving behind your mortality and everyone you've ever known to join a goddess. Although that does sound really awesome. Other than those two tiny things, I really enjoyed the story and am excited to see where it goes next! I think a lot of things from this book will likely come up again and become important, so I'm happy to give this 4 out of 5 stars. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 = 4/5 stars!"}, {"userName": "James Trevino", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52992135-james-trevino", "userReview": "Another 5 stars book from Riordan. Are you really surprised!?There seems to be a recurring theme with me and my favorite series. I always wait years before giving them a try and after that I kick myself for not doing it sooner. I did that with Harry Potter, then with Tunnels (by Roderick Gordon and Brian Williams), then with Eragon, then with Robert Langdon. Even with The Lord of the Rings. Not one of my favorites was read \u2018on time\u2019.And Percy Jackson shares a lot of similarities with those books, especially Harry Potter. I said this before in a review, I think, but the main themes explored by the books are the same: friendship and family, courage and fortitude in dark times.And they both also share the beautiful fact that they have a great great, great villain. Seriously now, Luke is so damn great!The one thing that made me shake my fist like an old man was Annabeth missing for a large chunk of the book. It was a smart plot device for another adventure, but oh man, I missed her! But we have some new characters that grow on you as the book moves on, so don\u2019t worry, Riordan and his jokes are in full force.Overall, it is a wild ride!

I'm an unpublished writer and I know the best I can hope for is that at some point some will like what I write, and some will well, rip it.I've not been \"real complimentary' of these books up to this point, I gave each 3 stars...said they were what I'd call, \"not bad\". I dropped this one to 2 stars...it's getting to \"bad\".First, I must say apologetically that the writing isn't all that great. I know these have sold millions and we have the first movie in what I know a lot of people hope will be a series. I can't account for people's taste, I mean look at Gilligan's Island. Reading these books I must say that somewhere there's probably a toddler with a parent reading them to him/her who is thinking something like, \"Percy is just now getting that? I figured it out 5 chapters ago\". Percy Jackson is without a doubt as dense as a locust fence post. The kid is written so thick I'm surprised he can get his shoes on. I'd never have trusted this kid with a butter knife, much less a magic sword (of course luckily it won't hurt \"mortals\" only \"immortals' as it's made of celestial bronze. This must be an odd kind of bronze as I know all bronze I've come in contact with is pretty much as solid as any other metal.). Aside from the usual problem of Percy being so frustratingly (your going to see that word or it's root \"frustrate\" a few times in this review) thick this book manages to go to new heights in it's efforts to drive readers into banging their heads into walls. Without giving a spoiler, there is another regular character in the books who has been sort of the \"counter-point\" to Percy's inability to understand the most elementary event. Her character has been fairly well established. SO, to set up the action in this book the author has her do something so frustratingly (yes, there's the word) stupid and against character that I knew things weren't going to go well. Yes, I got what was supposed to be the reason in/for the act...but she'd never have acted so stupidly, not the girl we met in the first 2 books.There are other problems here that were smaller in the first two books but apparently like wounds left untended have festered and are now overpowering the rest of the story. His playing fast and loose with history and myth are getting beyond my tolerance. He managed to turn Artemis the hunter into a sort of female Peter Pan and her huntresses into a girls club of \"lost girls\" instead of \"lost boys\" stuck at that age where little boys go \"yuck girls\" and little girls go \"yuck boys\". I could almost hear them singing....\" I won't grow up, I won't grow up...I don't want to go to school, I don't want to go to school....\" Need I say any more, maybe the story's take on Hercules? Maybe more of the incorrect slant given to the Greek Pantheon? If ignorance was contagious or misinformation was infectious this book would be banned by the CDC. I've been treating these books as YA books. They are so frustratingly simplistic I think I need to think of them more as juvenile level reads and go from there. I got them from the library and the next 2 are laying here (the second through the 5th came in together). Were I buying these I'd probably have stopped earlier, this one would bring me even closer to it. Were my kids still small and had they gotten into these I'd definitely go over anything they were picking up from them book by book. On the positive side (I need to say something positive) the books do manage to show the pettiness and selfishness that was so prevalent in the character of the deities and heroes of Greek myth. It fails in filling that out, but it is there. I live in hope that the next book won't frustrate me as badly as this one has. \"Where there's life there's hope\" as the old saying goes...and I keep hoping. I'll drop this volume to 2 stars and hope the next is better."}, {"userName": "Jessica Olson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48477217-jessica-olson", "userReview": "I love you Percy"}, {"userName": "Deborah Obida", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54790180-deborah-obida", "userReview": "Its official, this is my favourite in the series.

Percy was still AMAZING!! I Loved his narration (don't know how many times I will say this :p). I felt his narration little more humorous this time.Annabeth and Artemis, goddess of hunt, have been kidnapped by Titans' General. Percy, with new fellows, saves them. => Like the previous books, this book also started with the encounter of monster in a school. He was after two half-bloods, Nico and Bianca. Nico didn't appear much but I liked him except in the ending. I can't blame him for what he did. Because he is just an immature 10 years old child. Bianca. I didn't like her regardless of her selfishness. She seemed pretty much useless to me. Just a filler to fulfil the prophecy. I am more interested in Nico after this ending.=> Zo\u00eb was a pretty good character. I liked her. Initially I hated her. But as the book progressed her character improved tremendously. I understood her reasons. But her fate was too bad to be for her. It was a tragedy!=> Artemis. She was good. Well, I didn't know Artemis was the name of a goddess. But I prefer Artemis for male. Maybe because I have read this name in Artemis Fowl series as a male. => The Prophecy in this book was the best one so far. I was very excited by this one to see how this would unfold.  Five shall go west to the goddess in chains One shall be lost in the land without rain, The bane of Olympus shows the trail, Campers and Hunters combined prevail, The Titan\u2019s curse must one withstand, And one shall perish by a parent\u2019s hand=> Thalia. I thought she would become power-hungry. But thank God she didn't. I must admit that I didn't like her joining the Hunt even though I understood her reason. Anyway, looking forward to more of her.=> Tyson will be coming back in the next one! OMG! I loved him soo much last time. He wasn't properly present in this book except for a few chats.

They were trying to retrieve them but they ran into trouble and they lost Annabeth. *ooooppssss*\n\nAnd before anyone could react, the monster, with Annabeth still on his back, leaped over the cliff and tumbled into the darkness.\n\nArtemis and her hunters came to help them, but they couldn't get to Annabeth. Percy and the others need to get back to Camp Half Blood to get the Di Angelo kids to safety and find a way to get Annabeth back. And to Percy's dismay, he wasn't picked for the quest to save Annabeth.\n\n\"\n\n\nThalia would not have been my first choice to go on this quest. She's too impetous. She acts without thinking. She is too sure of herself.\"\n\n\n\"Would you have chosen me?\"\n\n\n\"Frankly, no,\" he said. \"You and Thalia are much alike.\"\n\nBut we all know that this is a Percy Jackson book. There is no way in hell he wouldn't be on that quest. And sure enough, he gets to join the trip. And there, they find out more about the chaos that Luke and Kronos is about to unleash.\nI don't think there is really much to say about these characters because I still really like them. I didn't find any problems with the main characters and also with the antagonists. I really like Luke's character because he is the type of villain that you want to change. I want him to change. I hope I get to see his character change in the last two books.Percy was still good. I still liked his character. Annabeth was not in this book too much which is a bummer because she's my favorite. Thalia was.. well.. annoying at time. Grover was still Grover.The additional Gods were a lot of fun to read about. There was my favorite Greek God Apollo. I was kind of wondering when we might see him. There was Artemis and her Hunters. I can't believe I'll be saying this, but Diyonisus wasn't so bad. Haha.\n- I still liked the characters. The newer ones were a good addition.- I liked how the characters weren't invincible. This made them real in my opinion. These kids were demigods, they are not immortal. So, they could die. And what these kids faced, it would be super unrealistic for none of them to die. Someone should. And someone did. *ooopss* Don't worry. It's not really a spoiler. It's part of the prophecy. Hehe. You guys just have to figure out who dies.- Percy's relationship with his mom is one of the things I liked about this book. I liked how she never gets disregarded. Her opinion still matters to him.- The writing is still as entertaining. It's super engaging and fresh. It's still unlike anything I've ever read before. I often wonder if Rick is really an adult because of the way he writes. He really captures mostly how a person Percy's age thinks and acts.- The villains were very villainy. I felt that they were really a threat to the kids and to the Gods too.\n- I didn't like how Annabeth was missing on a large chunk of this book. I did not appreciate that at all Rick!!! Annabeth is like my soul sister, I did not appreciate not reading about her.- I had a bit of a hard time connecting with Thalia at first. We what happened to her and how she lived from the last book. There wasn't any time to connect with her at all since she was there on the first chapter like she wasn't a tree on the last book.- There were lines on the first few chapters that sounded a lot like what Dumbledore from Harry Potter would say.\nI am obsessed with this series! I loved Greek Myth. I probably have read every Greek myth there ever is (that might be an exagerration but I really love Greek Myth). I've also read quite a few Greek myth retellings but this is by far the most fun, enjoyable and creative of the bunch. I love Percy and would definitely read more of Rick Riordan's books.I highly recommend this series!!!If you haven't picked this series up, what are you doing with your life? :DRead it. Read it.

The Lightning Thief was a solid 4\u2014no more, no less. The Sea of Monsters was really a 4.5, but I couldn\u2019t quite round it up to 5, so here we are. The Titan\u2019s Curse, unfortunately, is a 3.5 rounded up\u2014and I almost didn\u2019t do that, but I have enjoyed the series itself so much overall that I felt like it was worth it. This was the least interesting book in the series so far to me, and had the least enjoyable cast. In a way, it's nice to know that there are Greek gods out there, because you have somebody to blame when things go wrong. For instance, when you're walking away from a bus that's just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it's raining on top of everything else, most people might think that's just really bad luck; when you're a half-blood, you understand that some divine force is really trying to mess up your day.Of course, as always, we get to spend time with Percy and Grover, but the opening of the book enters into Annabeth being whisked away, and that set a bit of a bad precedent for the entire installment for me, as I genuinely enjoy Annabeth\u2019s character, as well as the banter she offers. Her presence is more or less replaced by Thalia\u2019s return, as well as the new introduction of Artemis\u2019 righthand Huntress, Zoe\u2014neither of whom quite lived up to the standard that Rick\u2019s books have set for characters so far.\u201cLove conquers all,\" Aphrodite promised. \"Look at Helen and Paris. Did they let anything come between them?\"\"Didn't they start the Trojan War and get thousands of people killed?\"\"Pfft. That's not the point. Follow your heart.\u201dStruggles with the characters aside, enough things remain the same to be enjoyable: Percy is goofy and funny, Grover is terrified and precious, the gods and goddesses are weird and/or hilarious, and the action is suspenseful and easy to follow. Most MG fantasy series have a formula of sorts to them, and Percy is no exception, but the formula in these books is comforting and warm, rather than growing stale. The cafe windows wrapped all the way around the observation floor, which gave us a beautiful panoramic view of the skeleton army that had come to kill us.As I expected, it feels as though the narrative is growing with Percy\u2014these books feel like they were created for a fanbase that could age alongside each title\u2019s release, and the plots and dialogue are steadily beginning to feel closer and closer to the YA age range. I love watching this development unfold in the characters and storyline, and genuinely cannot wait to see where it leads to next. \u201cStars,\" she whispered. \"I can see the stars again, my lady.\u201dThe last thing I want to say about The Titan\u2019s Curse is that I was taken aback by how sad some of its scenes are. There\u2019s a surprising amount of death and impending doom in this installment\u2014the heroes even begin their journey with a prophesy looming over them that promises one child\u2019s death\u2014and, without spoiling anything, I\u2019ll just tell you that this was the first installment to make me cry over a loss. The fact that I found myself connecting to the characters that well, despite not loving all of the ones who get a lot of screen time in this installment, felt promising and made me incredibly eager to continue this series. \u201cEver had a flying burrito hit you? Well, it's a deadly projectile, right up there with cannonballs and grenades.\u201dAll in all, this book was my least favorite so far, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I cannot recommend this series highly enough if you enjoy fantastical adventures, lovable kids, hilarious (albeit super goofy at times) dialogue, and a really fun plot to suck you in.You can find this review and more on my blog, or you can follow me on twitter, bookstagram, or facebook!"}, {"userName": "Chelsea (chelseadolling reads)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16219087-chelsea-chelseadolling-reads", "userReview": "I actually found myself laughing aloud at some of the dad jokes in this one.

It\u2019s just so wonderfully creative. I find myself admiring the way Riordan weaves in bits of mythology facts and stories in Percy\u2019s story. And AGH the characters are just so fleshed-out and funny and endearing.I find it easy, especially as a young, modern reader, to detest the gods we read about in ancient tragedies and myths. It\u2019s like, \u201cWhy are the gods so cruel? Why is it such a norm that Zeus and other gods rape humans (and other creatures)? Why is cheating and literally throwing away one\u2019s mistress to a brothel an OK thing? Why aren\u2019t the gods more kind to humans? Is cutting the head off his body really necessary? Is it really Helen\u2019s fault for starting the Trojan War, or the GODS who planted the seeds for the war to happen?\u201d Etc. Etc. It\u2019s conflicting and intriguing, but the gods in Greek mythology can be rather unlikable at times (in my opinion).HOWEVER, the way Riordan tells his modern twist and portrayal on mythology makes me adore everyone. They feel real and colorful. Not perfect, but still somehow likable and understandable. And the characters he CREATES \u2013 I love them so much. Percy who is loyalty, relatable, and such a cute, brave kid. Annabeth who is wise and arrogant, and kinda a badass. Grover who is funny, sweet, and a total goofball. \u2013 EVERYONE is so amusing and often times lovable.Anyway, I love it. I love it. I love it. The plot twists are craaaaazy in this book, and I can\u2019t wait to read the next one!
