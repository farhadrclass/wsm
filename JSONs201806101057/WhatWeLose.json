You may be able to pass in mainstream society, appearing acceptable to others, even desired. But in reality you have nowhere to rest, nowhere to feel safe. Even while you\u2019re out in public, feeling fine and free, inside you cannot shake the feeling of rootlessness. Others may envy you, but this masks the fact that at night, there is nowhere safe for you, no place to call your own.\nThis is a tiny book - I don't know the word count, but it is surely barely more than a novella - and it contains short, punchy chapters that cover a broad range of issues, disjointed narration, and strange jumps in time. But, despite its size, it hit me really hard.It's difficult to know which aspect to start with. Clemmons covers so many themes, including but not limited to love, marriage, race (particularly being mixed race), motherhood, apartheid in South Africa, modern day Johannesburg, and abortion. Thandi leads us through all these things, both with her personal experiences and secondhand observations.What We Lose is the complete opposite of a slow, gradual book that leads up to a bigger picture. Every chapter hits fast and hard, leaving a lasting impression. The writing is succinct and powerful, offering tidbits filled with truth on human nature in almost every sentence. But I have not talked about the main story, really, behind everything else I've mentioned. At its heart, this novel is about the kind of deep grief that pervades every part of your life. Thandi is so lost without her mother that her grief becomes a part of everything. The effect of filling a novel about grief with so many important themes - as noted: race, marriage, apartheid, etc. - is the realisation of grief's all-encompassing nature. Not only is it forever in the background of Thandi's personal life; it is forever in the background of everything.I especially love this quote:\n\u201cOftentimes I find myself, when we are fighting over the bills, or when he chews his food too loudly or laughs at the wrong time during a film, asking not whether I am happy, but whether my mother would approve of him.\u201d\nWhat We Lose broke my heart several times. It's a powerful book about many important things but, of course, what affected me most was the loss of someone who is so vital to a person's life. How do you go on when your anchor, your constant, isn't there anymore? I don't know. I dread the day when I find out.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Sometimes there is no reason to write a review.....( so it feels) - to me.

In this area of essays and important novels, when the representation of minorities in fiction is still so criminally inexistent, I love that this book exists, but looking back, that's not what I'll recall. The intense sense of dread I feel when I read about the loss of a parent, that I will.\n\"Yes, there is that dark, terrifying loneliness that scares me, but I am acquainted with fear. If I stay inside long enough, root my heels in deeper, it doesn't feel scary anymore. It feels like home.\"\nSee, I can see readers being confused by the numerous times Zinzi Clemmons skips from one subject to another, or by the disjointed narration and the multiples jumps in time : I wasn't. The construction is solid in my opinion and I was interested in her slices of life, both in South Africa and in the United States, on what it means to be a black woman in nowadays America ; on the everyday racism, that does not need to wear a white robe to be insufferable and unacceptable, this racism that tells black girls that they should straighten their hair, accept what they have and stop resisting. The denunciation of that racism is needed, and welcomed. Yet I don't know how What We Lose is marketed, but it's very much a coming-of-age, getting past a loss novel, above everything else. It reads like a memoir, a memoir in which I could see me.The way Zinzi Clemmons depicts grief is not spectacular, and it made me so, so happy. I don't know why most authors handles this subject with loud bangs, forever dramatic, and forget that the worst thing about grief is the intrinsic, hollow boredom we feel when the funerals are over. Everyone can go on with their lives, and here we are, stopped. Everything in this novels feels so accurate.\n\"Lose is a straightforward equation : 2 - 1 = 1. A person is there, then she is not. But a loss is beyond numbers, as well as sadness, and depression, and guilt, and ecstasy, and hope, and nostalgia - all those emotions that expert tell us come along with death. Minus one person equals all of these, in unpredictable combinations. It is a sunny day that feels completely gray, and laughter in the midst of sadness. It is utter confusion. It makes no sense.\"\nThe thing is, when you lose your mum or your dad, everyone on Earth expects you to follow a certain pattern of behavior, and when you don't, you feel lesser than dirt. My dad died four years ago, and no, I don't remember his voice. My dad died four years ago, and no, I don't believe in heaven ; I don't think he's looking after me ; I don't talk to him ; I don't go on his grave because I don't think he's there ; My dad died four years ago and I think he's nowhere. I miss him so much, but I think he's nowhere. Even now, I want to hit something when people tells me that he's somewhere, smiling in the sky, and - as Zinzi Clemmons perfectly summed it up - that I need to acknowledge him, like this clich\u00e9 of the persistent orphan who's really living her life to make her lost parent proud. I refuse. God, knowing my dad, he would have laughed out loud at these antics. Most \"orphan novels\" rely on this pattern, and every time, it makes me feel so, so inexistent. What We Lose does, too, but contrary to most novels, it doesn't stop there. It shows us that there's no such thing as one way to deal with loss, and for that I'm grateful. I also liked Zinzi Clemmons's reflection about motherhood and the way our society puts maternity above everything else. As a woman who probably won't have any children, and whose work revolves around giving children more chances, I appreciated her nuanced take on this subject, and the doubts she expressed : \n\"I do not see the mother with a child as either more morally credible or more morally capable than any other woman. A child can be used as a symbolic credential, a sentimental object, a badge of self-righteousness. I question the implicit belief that only \"mothers\" with \"children of their own\" have a real stake in the future of humanity.\"\nWhat We Lose's ultimate simplicity is probably going to cause it to lose some readers, but that's what kept me. Many readers won't understand what's the point, and that's okay. Even if I'll never reread it, I'm glad it exists somewhere. I'm glad, and it's as simple as that.\n\"... and I think, 'I have to call Mama to say hello.'\"I realized that that was how heartbreak occurred. Your heart wants something, but reality resists it. Death is inert and heavy, and it has no relation to your heart's desires.\"\n[Flower credit]For more of my reviews, please visit:"}, {"userName": "Darkowaa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24659898-darkowaa", "userReview": "!!! Book blog review: https://africanbookaddict.com/2017/07...Laden with meditative, intimate and at times unsettling vignettes, What We Lose will leave you in a pensive state. Thandi \u2013 the heroine of this novel, is the only child of her mother (a coloured South African) and father (a light skinned African American) who is very aware of her privileges & multicultural background. Readers follow Thandi on her journey from childhood to adulthood as she navigates what it means to be a black woman in America and South Africa, dealing with the loss of a loved one, motherhood and love.What We Lose is based on Zinzi Clemmons\u2019s life, BUT it isn\u2019t her life. If you\u2019ve been following Clemmons\u2019s work online, especially her 2013 piece \u2013 A Geography of Hurt, you\u2019d find the subject matter in this novel familiar. While there isn\u2019t a clear-cut plot to this novel, Clemmons successfully portrays Thandi\u2019s life through short vignettes. The vignettes reflect Thandi\u2019s complex thoughts \u2013 private, absorbing and heartfelt thoughts, that one probably wouldn\u2019t even share with their closest partner. Some bits of the text feel philosophical which was confusing at times, but appreciated. I love how pictures and graphs and random news articles are scattered throughout the book, as it gave the storytelling an unconventional feel.Johannesburg, South Africa plays a vital role in this novel. The world is so absorbed in American politics (aka: Trump) that we forget about the intense and ever present racism in post-apartheid South Africa. Thandi and her family are coloureds and wealthy, so readers experience a different account of racial dynamics in South Africa through their lens, which is refreshing. It was intriguing to see how American racial relations and South African racial relations were juxtaposed and how they impacted Thandi\u2019s life and even play a role in her grieving process and the important decisions she makes in her life.Anyone whose lost a parent will deeply resonate with this novel. I initially thought this novel would be morbid and sorrowful, but I was glad to find that it reads more as a visceral novel \u2013 deep feelings and black psyche are articulated so aptly!I\u2019m not sure how this book is being marketed to the public; but for me, What We Lose tackles so much more than the issue of race. This coming-of-age novel reminds you that we are all human. We are all dealing with our personal struggles. We are all trying to thrive and heal and survive. Illness, love, race, mental health, motherhood, sisterhood and social class dynamics are wonderfully weaved into the overall themes of grief and the quest to belong.Read full review + quotes on: africanbookaddict.com"}, {"userName": "Latanya (CraftyScribbles)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24192262-latanya-craftyscribbles", "userReview": "Throughout my life, coming-of-age novels peppered themselves onto bookshelves whenever I ventured. In these novels, heartbreak, love, loss, and joys scattered their footprints, asking me to grasp the main character's journey by finding similarity.Most of the time, they failed as they offered two hundred and more pages of a life I witnessed on television and movie matinees. Bottled in blonde ponytails and bouncy curl drenched in Prell shampoo, any hardships described on the page felt sweeter than my actual life. Their attempts at connection rang hollow, because as a black girl (woman), what should have united us (e.g. girlhood, womanhood) ignored vital intersections that \u00a0rendered their stories \"cute\" and not to be taken seriously. No, Becky with the good hair, we could be friends, but you'll never understand me, even if you tried.Via intimate, unsettling, and pining vignettes, Zinzi Clemmons' What We Lose gifted me one of the few options of a coming-of-age novel that rang more true than I anticipated. Race, family, loss, sex, and identity cultivated this novel. Despite the fifteen years or so, separating me from the author, her heroine, Thandi, the daughter of a South African \"colored\" woman and a light-skinned black American man, mirrored experiences founding my life's walls. Born and raised in Philadelphia, she navigated her life with privileges her multicultural background granted, while trying to interpret her carbon footprint in society. When not pulled between worlds - black and white, American and South African, she hashes rich and middle-class by realizing the gumbo her life created and how those outside do not benefit.\u00a0\u201cBut when I call myself black, my cousins look at me askance. They are what is called coloured in South Africa\u2014mixed race\u2014and my father is light-skinned black. I looked just like my relatives, but calling myself black was wrong to them\u2026. American blacks were my precarious homeland\u2014because of my light skin and foreign roots, I was never fully accepted by any face.\u201dShe's in, but she's not. She's a \"strange in-betweener\", cognizant of her need to belong, but, with her family and friends as anchors, she's not the tragic mulatto, as in Nella Larson's stories, which sweetened the pot. Strangely, this novel read as a memoir, which Clemmons' denied. Believing the author's hard, after reading her background. Each vignette felt like a private and provocative diary passage, except time's chartered, not in actual dates, but in Thandi's external actions. She fell and rose, fell and rose, until she settled her feet on the rocky pavement by story's end.As mentioned before, family played a major role. Her mother - the rock of her small family (She had no siblings) - taught her key elements of living in her body and how to strengthen her mind, body, and soul, in a society not welcoming. Johannesburg, her mother's birthplace, received contemplative moments. Its class and racial system. Her family's belief system. Its violence. They shaped her mother. They shaped her.Unfortunately, her mother's diagnosed with cancer, providing her another basis for identity. She noted the disease as one where one's privilege determined treatment and survival. Upon her mother's passing, a void's unleashed, and throughout her grief cycle, what's unleashed afterwards defined the marker her continuous journey finds her. Anyone who lost a parent will understand her descriptions of grief and bereavement. Her discussion felt real and complex, never shallow. Having lost an aunt to cancer, I cried, purging some feelings I hid to preserve my sanity.Furthermore, I loved following Thandi on her journey, which never feels like a destination. Her journey continued, even when I finished the story. While not a free spirit or wanderer, she'll never fit in a societal box and she finds comfort in that notion. Also, I enjoyed the in-depth look at South Africa. I knew some things, but she offered me morsels that filled my curiosity.\u00a0The vignettes piqued my interest. At times, I yearned for longer chapters. But, feeling as though I knew Thandi, she gave me what she thought I deserved, not what I wanted. Her examination of another corner of the diverse black psyche paved honesty, creativity, and the discomfort we, as readers, required.\u00a0Bring tissues and a cup (pot, actually) of tea for her soul cleansing.\nVerdict\n: 4/5 Trips to Philly (I loved the snippets of my hometown described.

This was a quick read but a confusing one. I feel like the description led me to expect a pretty straight forward novel about a South African childhood and loss. Instead it reads like a braided essay in longform, a memoir of sorts, with attempts to pull in other information. But it also feels unfinished, with several more revisions needed to really make the transitions work, to bring the emotion in balance with the events, to flesh out a better level of detail of the actual events making up the \"novel.\" It reads more like a summary much of the time, an overview, rather than a series of events that come together for an actual story. I respond to emotion in writing, when it is presented in a way that brings me into the story. I expected this to have incredible resonance since I recently lost a parent to cancer. But I felt like an outsider the entire time. There is something about the way that the internal aspects of the story are presented that don't welcome you, rather they leave you wanting to turn away.I think if you are looking for a narrative to explain a South African childhood, I can better recommend Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood.This was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Vanessa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25545124-vanessa", "userReview": "A very contemporary feeling book that tackles modern day themes but also about the past and how both have a habit of interesecting each other.

This book tackles race, tradition and it's implications in melding it with her life in America. Sometimes she is torn between the two worlds. I feel like the main issues that are tackled here are concerning race and grieving and she tries to blend this together bringing a unique point of view which is startling at times but also powerful in its understatedness. This is raw confronting and powerful sock it to you writing, it's tough and gentle at the same time. So realistic it took my breath away at times. It explores the senselessness of death the numbing pain it causes, the utter devastation, isolation, loneliness and often the only way to brave it, is by lashing out to fill a certain void that's left, a void that can never be properly filled as Thandi discovers. This was an interesting take on the theme, essay style writing that seems to be very popular at the moment.

In What We Lose, Zinzi Clemmons writes about a young woman of mixed race whose mother passes away. In concise chapters, she explores her protagonist's grieving process as well as her experiences relatetd to race, apartheid in South Africa, marriage, family, and more. The personal and political intersect in this work of fiction, just as they do in real life.My own grandmother passed away last year, so perhaps I started this book searching for something unrealistically stellar. In some ways, Clemmons delivers with What We Lose, as she addresses important political themes while showing the messiness of grief and loss. A couple of lines related to grief resonated with me, to the point where I paused and took time to appreciate Clemmons's poignant prose. Still, I wished for so much more detail about the protagonist's internal life and her relationships. I wanted more detail about her relationship with Paul (though he sucked a lot), her grieving process, and how her foray into motherhood factored into everything else.

I\u2019m not saying that these things in themselves aren\u2019t interesting or valuable, I\u2019m just saying that they don\u2019t belong together within a single 200-page book, let alone one with the word \u201cNOVEL\u201d printed boldly on the cover. Clemmons can surely write, and I know she has experience and insight to share, but her delivery left me frustrated.

I wanted to understand her feelings on losing her mother in such a tragically painful way, how she coped in the years after this loss, but it becomes clear that such an un-self aware character would have little of that to share. The result is that there is very little obvious growth in her character at all.

A series of vignettes that presents itself as a novel can be really tricky to pull of, and in What We Lose, I was irritated by its use. It wasn't so much that I don't like vignettes, but that in this book, some (to me) came across as fillers because either didn't seem relevant to the plot (Ms Madikizela-Mandela vignettes) or felt unconvincing. I truly appreciated the vignettes that directly explored Thandi's sense of loss and reflections on her mother.

I had become so enraptured in the writing, I hadn\u2019t for a second thought it wasn\u2019t memoir. Thandi is such a fully realised person that I fully believed What We Lose was the story of her life, and a life that actually lived.What We Lose follows Thandi through the death of her mother, told through short vignettes in a style straight out of the literary memoir genre. Thandi is both American and South African, but she feels not quite either, and the non-linearity of the novel finds her both in love and falling out of love at the same time.Through her eyes (and Zinzi\u2019s) the reader is told a lot about the history of South Africa, from Oskar Pistorious to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to the photography of Kevin Carter. The novel also includes photographs and short poems, creating a multimedia experience akin to Claudia Rankin\u2019s poetry collections.While it took me only an evening to read this novella, the emotions linger. Clemmons explores the spectrum of grief from the sudden bereavement to forgetting their voice. Her writing is honest and ragged raw. I\u2019m still thinking about Thandi now, and wondering how about her life after the novel.I truly, truly think that What We Lose is going to grab the attention of several literary awards. It\u2019s an impressive, profound novella that balances history with the complexities of romance, grief and a sense of belonging.What to read next:Homegoing by Yaa GyasiPassing by Nella LarsenAmericanah by Chimamanda Ngozi AdichieThank you kindly to the team at Harper Collins Insider and 4th Estate Press for sharing this copy with me."}, {"userName": "Olive (abookolive)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17420799-olive-abookolive", "userReview": "See my review on my booktube channel: https://youtu.be/Bp6MNHxXitc"}, {"userName": "Joachim Stoop", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4263900-joachim-stoop", "userReview": "2,5/5Sometimes I really don't get the buzz, promo and high ratings surrounding a book.

Never quite feeling like she belongs, Thandi is in search of love. Not in the romantic comedy sense; she is desperate to belong. She is a light-skinned black woman, therefore she doesn\u2019t feel at home with black or white people. Having been raised in the States but born in Africa, she feels she doesn\u2019t belong anywhere. A brutally honest rumination on race, sex, grief, and family, this short novel is written in searing, white hot language. Zinzi Clemmons\u2019s prose is divine. Emotionally honest at its core, this debut novel hit me unexpectedly hard\u2014it is exceptionally courageous. For example, one of my favorite passages: \u201dWhen my lover and I fuck, we fuck with the fear of the world in us. We are fucking on the edge of a cliff. We are fucking death right in the ass, and death loves it. We are fucking our own deaths, and our mothers\u2019 deaths, and the deaths of our friends and the deaths of our rights.\u201d Wise and tender and achingly real, this examination of death and motherhood, country and brotherhood, is one not to be missed. A high-class literary treat. My highest recommendation."}, {"userName": "La La", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17265997-la-la", "userReview": "3 stars on the blog.I know you are all saying, \"Huh?\" How can it be five stars here and three stars on the blog? Well, this book has gotten quite a few one star ratings based solely on the fact that it is about African American culture and race relations; one reviewer said she is sick of all the \"trendy\" POC titles. Yeah, can you believe that? So, therefore, despite all of the mechanical problems I had with this book, it is getting five Goodreads stars from me because of its message and the insight it provides.Also, for all of those \"readers\" who gave it one star for being about minority cultural situations... approximately 50 percent of the story is about a college student dealing with a parent's illness and death, ten percent is about family issues not related to color, and another ten percent is about relationships. That adds up to around only 30 percent being specifically about black culture and race relations, so based on your assessment of your rating you should be giving the book three stars.Now for my thoughts on this title...The narration was dry. Most of the time it was like reading the diary of someone who was not much inspired to journal. The storyline was chaotic, it switched between characters and time periods erratically. The author would start out using \"he\" referring to her boyfriend and then all sudden she mentions something and you realize somewhere along the line she had switched \"he\" to mean her father, or a cousin, etc. It took me a good chunk of the book to realize her mother passed away when she was in college, not high school like it seemed in the beginning. I had to go back and re-read previous sections of the story to place what was going on, and everyone knows that is one of my biggest pet peeves.There were also continuity problems. At one point she was talking about discussing something with a person and then two paragraphs later she was saying how she hadn't told them about the situation yet, then it went back to saying they had discussed it. The MC would be one place and then without any mention of how, or why, they would be somewhere else. The character would also jump time frames without warning.There were weird unexplained scenes like: although she had a car she for some reason ended up taking a city bus somewhere and back again. Some events, like the bus trip scenerio, had no correlation to the story and I would be thinking these things were going to affect something later in the book, but they didn't. And then there was a rather large section of textbook type South African history unceremoniously plunked down in the middle of a scene, which would have been more effective parceled out through the story in smaller pieces.Honestly, it was like reading a scattered second draft. Like the publisher was so fired up to get it published they didn't bother with final edits. This is Adult Fiction and the Young Adult title The Hate U Give puts this book to shame for solid storytelling; which is a shame because content wise this book has a lot of profound statements to make.I was approved for an eARC, via Edelweiss, in return for an honest review. I was also sent a physical copy by the publisher.This title will be included in a blog post I am doing about Goodreads members rating books before reading them.

A fragmented narrative in the style of a memoir about a young woman named Thandi who loses her mother to breast cancer and gives birth to her first child, this story is ripped apart by centrifugal forces \u2013 so duck down, reader, Clemmons\u2019 free-flying ideas and ruminations might hit you in the head, and instead of an epiphany, you might just get a headache. Let\u2019s look at some of the topics Clemmons meditates on:- South AfricaThandi\u2019s mother was born in South Africa, and we hear some random things about the country \u2013 this could have been absolutely fascinating, as Thandi\u2019s mother was mixed-race (the very existence of mixed-race children used to be illegal in South Africa), but beware, it is not. So if you want to learn more about this country, do yourself a favor and read Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood instead. - Losing a parent to illnessUnfortunately, watching a parent die slowly from a severe illness is something I happen to know quite a bit about, and while people deal with this very differently (which could make this book highly interesting), it never became clear to me how witnessing the slow demise of her mother affected Thandi. Dreams, thoughts, and recollections randomly pop up, and Clemmons mixes in some psychological facts about grief, but everything remained rather abstract to me. If the great emotional insight here is supposed to be that losing a parent means to live on with a constant void, that\u2019s quite a let-down.- Child and marriageEven Thandi\u2019s unwanted pregnancy and her marriage simply made me shrug, probably because Clemmons does not connect these events well to the topics of loss, grief, and race. It feels like Thandi does not manage to venture to the bottom of her psyche and her motivations, and as we hear the story from her point of view, she as a character remains vague \u2013 too vague to really care about her.All in all, I found this pretty underwhelming \u2013 where are the new ideas? Where is the emotional depth? To be fair, I listened to the audiobook, so maybe the photos and graphs included in the printed version would have made the book more enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Andre", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5321728-andre", "userReview": "Splendidly different. Is it a Novel? Vignettes? Memoir? Meditation on loss? Or as author Zinzi Clemmons calls it in her acknowledgments, a \u201cweird little book.\u201c I say it is all of the above and the sum total adds up to a wonderful debut. This novel is one that defies categorization and that adds to its charm and it is structured quite differently than one normally finds in works defined as fiction. The book initially reads like a memoir, which is not necessarily a bad thing, in fact I believe it\u2019s an indicator of how great the fiction is, if a reader has the impression that what is being read is real. And it is seemingly obvious this work is drawn from the author\u2019s own experiences. The pages are sometimes just one or two paragraphs that talk about something going on in the life of protagonist, Thandi. Her friends, her school, her romances, her thoughts on all these always smart, always pensive. The book is separated into three parts, and the second part in which Thandi loses her mother to cancer is the most consistent from page to page in being faithful to a singular theme. It is also the strongest part of the novel in the many descriptions of grief that hit home. \u201cThis was the paradox: How would I ever heal from losing the person who healed me? The question was so enormous that I could see only my entire life, everything I know, filling it.\u201c It is unlike anything you have read and though the unorthodox structure may turn off some readers, the book still flows in a way that honors the storytelling of fiction, and the elements that go into a coming of age story told in a story-less way. Zinzi Clemmons pulls it off with skillful prose and thoughtfulness and frankly I found the quirkiness refreshing. She is an author to keep an eye on, and I eagerly await her next book."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58321492-sara", "userReview": "This book is gorgeous and readable and smart.

It reads like a memoir and I actually double-checked that it was, in fact, a novel after I started reading. Clemmons shared brilliant and brilliantly worded commentary on terminal illness, grief, race, the violence in post-apartheid South Africa, and the cultural differences between her and her South African cousins.\"American blacks were my precarious homeland \u2013 because of my light skin and foreign roots, I was never fully accepted by any race. Plus my family had money, and all the black kids in my town came from the poorer areas. I was friends with the kids who lived on my block and were in my honors classes \u2013 white kids. I was a strange in-betweener.\"Unfortunately, that brilliance was inconsistent. The novel is structured into vignettes that jump around in time and don\u2019t always hang together. It felt jumpy and prevented me from becoming engrossed in the story for any sustained period of time.

Thandi's mother has been the most stabilizing force in her life.The impact of her mother's death, the details of her mother's illness, the dispassionate quotes from the literature of grief and dying contrasting with the agony of Thandi's loss broke my heart and brought me to tears. Although my mother died many years ago, I was brought back to her death with an immediacy that I would not have believed possible. So vividly does Clemmons speak the voice of loss.Thandi's world unravels. She leaves college for a while, falls in love and has to face an unintended pregnancy. Clemmons presents Thandi's struggles in all their messiness with few neat endings. The chapters are short, often meditations on different aspects of life and loss.

She is an outsider wherever she goes, caught between being black and white, American and not. She tries to connect these dislocated pieces of her life, and as her mother succumbs to cancer, Thandi searches for an anchor\u2014someone, or something, to love. In arresting and unsettling prose, we watch Thandi\u2019s life unfold, from losing her mother and learning to live without the person who has most profoundly shaped her existence, to her own encounters with romance and unexpected motherhood. Through exquisite and emotional vignettes, Clemmons creates a stunning portrayal of what it means to choose to live, after loss.
