These are the two passions of my life: research and storytelling.I'm a Licensed Professional Counselor and an author, so I devour Brown's books. My favorite is The Power of Vulnerability. I have watched her TED talks probably a hundred times. I tell every one of my clients to read her books and watch her videos. I'm a huge fan.However, this book wasn't fun or pleasurable the way her other books have been. I listened on Audible and felt pained much of the time. Part of that is because I identify with the ways I've armored up after the 2016 election. I lean conservative and have tried to share my views with civility and have always encouraged people to respectfully share theirs. Yet I've been called every name you could imagine. Sadly the worst offenses came from my Christian brothers and sisters who see things differently. One of the cruelest people was an author who wrote a book (that I purchased) about how we need to listen to peoples' stories so we can understand their points of view. Oh the irony. I finally reached a place where I lumped all of them into a group of haters. I stopped listening and stopped caring what the opposing side had to say.With that as my history, I found Brown's research about dehumanization helpful. I needed her information about what helps people who are in heated debates.When I'm in the counseling setting this is easy for me to do. I love to hear all sorts of views, even ones I disagree with. I want to know how and why people see the world the way they do. But, experiencing our country so divided, I admit I had armored up and sided up.I will definitely seek to apply parts of Brown's book to my life."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Library overdrive Audiobook.... read by Breen Brown Note: I enjoyed this so much that I\u2019m considering buying the Audiobook.There may be thousands of people around the world who are huge fans .....and even though I had read one of her books ( wasn\u2019t all that impressed), and later listened to one of her Audiobook\u2019s ( I was much more impressed), I still didn\u2019t consider myself a fan of her work - and quite frankly I really didn\u2019t really \u2018get\u2019 what her deal was in the world. In fact - I didn\u2019t even know what she looked like until I read this book which lead me to research \u2018her\u2019 a little more. A semi- famous- very successful social scientist called herself a \u201cResearch Storyteller\u201d. It\u2019s a perfect way to describe Brene Brown. By the way, I love her first name, Brene.I admit - after listening to this Audiobook\u2014I\u2019m in! I\u2019m a fan of the work she\u2019s doing. The way she talked about belonging - as opposed to being excluded - had me looking at this topic from an angle I hadn\u2019t thought about. One of the early stories she shared about from her childhood had me wondering if I had ever abandoned my children in \u2018spirit\u2019 - from a look of disappointment- from my silence - from not comforting them when they needed me. It hurt to think that maybe at times I did ......and that even though 90% of the time I might not have - or even 99% of the time I didn\u2019t .....one time - 1% could be enough to shift a child\u2019s self. worth. Brene\u2019s story was so powerful - I replayed the audiobook from the beginning to have Paul hear this story. Paul continued listening for a couple of hours -since he\u2019s not done - I guess I\u2019m just going to buy it after all. The topics & themes in \u201cBraving the Wilderness\u201d......are brilliant tools of gold \u2014( she\u2019s not preaching) \u2014- she\u2019s presenting years of research from SOCIAL STUDIES. Her work presented in this book is AT LEAST engaging! She has our full attention!The political issues issues she talks about - ways in which we divide - etc. are also interesting. Brene is an animated spokeswoman. I happen to agree with the benefits - the concepts she speaks of learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable...sharing our vulnerability and being true to ourselves rather than trying to fit in. It can be very difficult to bring up uncomfortable issues in our relationships- we make mistakes - don\u2019t always do it right - but with practice we get better. By avoiding confrontation in order to feel more comfortable- nothing gets accomplished - and \u2018inside\u2019 we really don\u2019t feel any better. Brene details effective ways that help support tricky situations we all face in life....Not from winging a good idea...she speaks from years of THAT RESEARCH AGAIN. Paul, my husband, was equally as impressed with Brene Brown on this Audiobook as I was. Her dedication to \u2018research\u2019 shows and her authenticity is clear! Personal value isn\u2019t instantly measurable - but it couldn\u2019t possibly be so - instead its a little at a time. As we listen and explore the things Brene presents - we are slowly taking in alternative effective ways to support more joy, satisfaction, inspiration, empowerment, and love with ourselves and others. Brene Brown is an excellent- gifted speaker.

My partner who read the book with me pointed out that Brown mentions that she has a problem with not giving uninformed opinions on political topics but then she goes and does exactly that with much of this book. This is white liberal centrist lady kumbaya bullshit. She doesn't seem to understand how systemic violence works or oppression. There's an extreme amount of false equivalency in the book. Calling trump a pig is not at all similar to him dehumanizing women. Additionally, the book was extremely smug and prescriptive.

The book\u2019s subject is how to build and maintain connections and a sense of belonging while also staying true to ourselves and our beliefs. Through her research studies, personal experiences, and case studies combined with her remarkable perceptiveness and wisdom she provides essential directions through the wilderness of loneliness and disconnection. In today\u2019s climate of divisiveness and separation, this is a book everyone should read. But it\u2019s not some bitter medicine to swallow. As evidenced by her massively popular TED talks and books, her writing style and the accompanying research resonate with people and feed a real hunger for understanding, hope, and healing.

I found it meaningful, heartfelt, and the themes of belonging and being brave really resonated with me. I know Bren\u00e9 Brown has quite the cult following, but this was the first book of hers I have seriously read. A few years ago I had The Gifts of Imperfection foisted on me at work, and I was underwhelmed by the book and ended up hate-skimming it. A few friends had loved Daring Greatly, and now that I have read and appreciated Braving the Wilderness, I'm ready to give another Brown book a try.However, I will admit this isn't a perfect book. Brown tells a lot of stories, both hers and from friends and from her research in social work, but she repeats her themes a lot, and she doesn't give many specific details from her actual research. I was trying to describe this book to my husband, and struggled to accurately characterize it. It's part self-help, part memoir, part-psychology, and part inspirational. The reason this book spoke to me, however, was because the discussion about the need to belong was so impactful that I texted several friends about the book. It's a good book to read during these divisive political times, and I would recommend this book to anyone trying to survive the Trump era with their mental health intact.Favorite Quote\"Stop walking through the world looking for confirmation that you don't belong. You will always find it because you've made that your mission. Stop scouring people's faces for evidence that you're not enough. You will always find it because you've made that your goal. True belonging and self-worth are not goods; we don't negotiate their value with the world. The truth about who we are lives in our hearts. Our call to courage is to protect our wild heart against constant evaluation, especially our own.

Her books tend to re-verberate in my soul, in my mind--so I'm actively savoring them as I go about my day. I belong to myself--and I belong to no one. Speak truth to bullshit. Be civil.

In the end, Brene published a book on the backs of the numerous people that she quotes throughout the short book.

I don't think she had enough pulled together/thought through for a full release, so it feels not as complete. As if rushed for a deadline.I like the ideas of being brave with one's conviction, and willing to put yourself out there, even if you're alone to stand up for what you believe, but this still felt very *white* and from a protected, \"majority\" space.Two pieces that frustrated me.A) At one point, Brown tells the story of a pastor that speaks up for LGBTQ rights. This story is to help illustrate how one, even in the face of the (potentially homophobic christian) community they serve, they are will to stand up in support of others. This was described as Bravery, which it is for those who are in a community that encourages you to stay quiet in your majority comfort.What would have *also* been nice is to pair stories of people coming from majority/dominant culture along with those who have had to break out into the wilderness much much earlier, out of necessity, because they are NOT the majority. Because they are queer, or disabled, are not white, etc. The narrative around bravery is \"different\" when it feels less like a choice, but it's no less Brave. The focusing on the straight pastor supporting LGBTQ rights, but not including a story of an actual LGBTQ person alongside it felt more...performative for the sake of the narrative. (Not that the pastor is performative. Just how her story is being used here.) At one point, those Braving the Wilderness are likened to being at a outdoor dance party, like, \"I want to go to There\"- the place where people are free, dancing and Brave, but without also giving time to those that are out there dancing because For Real, they have Zero choice, and had not been given the option to go Inside. So, some are out in the Wilderness making the best of what that means, and yes, sometimes that means dancing. Some might be out in the wilderness and are sad, or lonely, or are just doing their laundry, but they're still in the Wilderness, because they are living their Non-Majority lives. It felt like for Majority people, like say, straight people, white people, abled people, they can Choose the Wilderness, and then have the cool option of touristing to the Wilderness Dance Party, but then still not really fathom the chasm the rests between those that Choose to go back Inside, like when it gets cold or really really hard, and those that still have to be outside no matter what.B) The second point that really frustrated me was the call for civility in these discussions as we Brave the Wilderness. This part felt really really White Lady Liberal Feminism. Like, \"If only you told me that criticism about my behavior in a nicer tone, or if you did it in a compliment sandwich, I would more likely listen to you tell me about that racist thing I just did.\" I think calling for people to be civil is fine. Let's be nice to each other, sure. BUT, if it's being pushed and also it's not discussed how calls for civility are often weaponized by white people, especially White Women, as a way to control the conversation (and STILL end up oppressing others.) I feel like white people especially, and I'm a white woman, need to walk into those \"Let's be civil\" conversations with a full understanding of how we abuse those specific calls to action for our own favor- to protect us, make us less uncomfortable, and put the burden on others to have to adjust to what we think is Real Civil Discourse. I found Brown's call for civility without cautioning about how that argument often abuses people of color to be troubling.So, for me, as a queer disabled person, I found this book is probably \"nicer\" and more inspiring if you're coming from the Majority space. Where it can feel novel/scary to stand up for someone who is different than you. If you're coming from a not-majority space though, it may not feel as connected as you may wish it to be.My last point that frustrated me is that I wish Brown showed more data. Often she writes, \"The data showed us that people feel like X,\" but never lists more concrete data. it's very general about big points, and it normally made me wish for something slightly heavier on the science part of social science. I listened to the audio version, and thought Brown did a fine job on the narration. I like her voice, so it was nice to listen to."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7162910-stephanie", "userReview": "The best description I have for Brene' Browns' books is she is constantly dropping truth bombs on my head and Braving the Wilderness is no exception. Navigating issues like shame, the persisting feeling of loneliness that people feel in a world that is more connected than ever, and how to humanize people who believe differently than ourselves, are not easy issues to tackle. Brown does so with research backed data and stories from her own life with ease. \"But the more we're willing to to seek out moments of collective joy and show up for experiences of collective pain-for real, in person, not online-the more difficult it becomes to deny our human connection, even with people we may disagree with. Not only do moments of collective emotion remind us of what is possible between people, but they also remind us of what is true about the human spirit. We are wired for connection. But the key is that, in any given moment of it, it has to be real.\""}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40452101-amanda", "userReview": "\u201cStop walking through the world looking for confirmation that you don\u2019t belong.

She is so awesome, so authentic, so vulnerable. And on audio, she is even better. She is funny, witty and amazing. In this book, Brene is talking much more about belonging, or the feeling of not belonging. A tough feeling. And the small tiny incidents are the ones that create sometimes the largest scars of are souls. Here is one such example, soul crusher one.The list was in numeric order. If your number was there, you\u2019d made the team. If your number wasn\u2019t there, you were out. I was number 62. My eye went straight for the 60s: 59, 61, 64, 65. I looked again. I just couldn\u2019t process it. I thought if I stared hard enough and the universe knew how much was on the line, the number might magically appear. I was ripped out of my negotiation with the universe by Kris\u2019s screaming. She was jumping up and down, and before I could make sense of what was happening, her dad had jumped out of the car, run up to her, grabbed her, and twirled her around, just like in the movies. I would later hear through the grapevine that I was a solid dancer but not really Bearkadette material. No bows. No shine. No group. No friends. Nowhere to belong.I was alone. And it felt devastating. I walked back to our station wagon and got in the backseat, and my dad drove away. My parents didn\u2019t say one word. Not a single word. The silence cut into me like a knife to the heart. They were ashamed of me and for me. My dad had been captain of the football team. My mom had been head of her drill team. I was nothing. My parents, especially my father, valued being cool and fitting in above all else. I was not cool. I didn\u2019t fit in.And now, for the first time, I didn\u2019t belong to my family either.Brene is talking about the importance of belonging. not belonging in our families is still one of the most dangerous hurts. That\u2019s because it has the power to break our heart, our spirit, and our sense of self-worth. It broke all three for me. And then there is one Maya Angelou's quote that she can't understand. She refuses to contain. And she does feel like there is some explanation to it, that should make sense. But there was one quote from Maya Angelou that I deeply disagreed with. It was a quote on belonging, which I came across when I was teaching a course on race and class at the University of Houston. In an interview with Bill Moyers that aired on public television in 1973, Dr. Angelou said:You are only free when you realize you belong no place\u2014you belong every place\u2014no place at all. The price is high. The reward is great.I love Brene's courage of being herself, not compromising on what she present. She talked about it also in The Power of Vulnerability: Teachings of Authenticity, Connections and Courage. When people ask her: can you leave shame out, we want the inspirational parts only. Just courage, not shame. Or being asked he\u2019d like me to not curse. Brene is brave, authentic and awesome (I said that already, but it should be said many times). She says:Bull. Shit. This is total bullshit. I\u2019m not doing this. I\u2019d rather never speak again. I am done moving.I love her standing for who she is. And I wish more books like Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, who are extremely weak on the likability points, would learn this: There are lots of great teachers and speakers\u2014you\u2019ll just need to find one who will dress up, clean up, and shut up. That\u2019s not me. Not anymore.I shall not be moved.Of course, I shall not be moved sounds a bit strong. But no one shall be tried to be moved to a place where they don't feel themselves anymore. And too many people, and too many places give the impression that they want us to be moved. Sometimes it's our imagination and fears (aka learn to try not to be liked by everyone, or else you will be a wall flower), and sometimes it is actually true (and terrible, and feels terrible). Brene, keep going! And be your amazing self! And help others be their amazing selves! 4 stars.

Of course, since Brown has made a career of studying vulnerability and shame, reading her book challenged me a lot and made me consider some uncomfortable ideas. The themes of Braving the Wilderness are seemingly contradictory: finding belonging and gaining the courage to stand alone. But Brown explains how the two are inextricably tied together. While I\u2019m still wrestling with some of her claims, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever fully agree with her on everything, I did take away one tidbit that for me was worth the cost of the book all on its own. She talks about how when we\u2019re afraid, we want to cover the entire world with leather so that when we run up against things, they won\u2019t hurt us. But of course that\u2019s bound to fail because we can\u2019t control everything about the world. Instead, we should put our shoes on.

The book is short and to the point. Many, many sections stood out to me. I will highlight some of my favorites. \n\"Today we are edging closer and closer to a world where political and ideological discourse has become an exercise in dehumanization. And social media are the primary platforms for our dehumanizing behavior. On Twitter and Facebook we can rapidly push the people with whom we disagree into the dangerous territory of moral exclusion, with little to no accountability, and often in complete anonymity.\"\nTHIS \n\"...shouldn't the rallying cry just be All Lives Matter? No. Because the humanity wasn't stripped from all the lives the way it was stripped from the lives of black citizens. In order for slavery to work, in order for us to buy, sell, beat, and trade people like animals, Americans had to completely dehumanize slaves. And whether we directly participated in that or were simply a member of a culture that at one time normalized that behavior, it shaped us.\"\npg. 90 Pretty much the entire section titled \"BULLSHIT\"My favorite quotes of all:\n\"The goal is to get to the place where we can think, I am aware of whats happening, the part I play, and how I can make it better, and that doesn't mean I have to deny the joy in my life.\"\n\n\"Stop walking through the world looking for confirmation that you don't belong.

Perhaps someone calls bullshit on that but, as much as I wish this book had been longer, it really hit hard on some stuff I've been thinking about relating to connection, to discourse, and to how divided we have become as a people (I already see people reading this review and stopping here because they're ready to call me a hippie white liberal living on cloud nine -- sure, I fit a few of those, but I'm also deeply devoted to change, to equality, to compassion, to empathy, and to putting my money where my mouth is in order to enact change toward this...I'm doing what I can to ensure I'm less of an asshole than I could be. Imperfect, messy, privileged because of a million reasons, and yet not allowing myself to be ignorant of any of those things). This book hits home an idea that we've seen again and again on social media especially. That we're all too willing to put people into the \"in\" or the \"out,\" without recognizing there's a lot of depth and nuance to each of us. Brown gives a lot of examples, and she talks about how we can have collective moments of joy or grief that really show us that middle ground, where people aren't quick to put you in or out (think: concerts, global tragedies, funerals). She doesn't call for ending divisions or everyone agreeing. In fact, that's the problem. What she calls for is for everyone to slow the hell down, be patient, be willing to call out the bullshit (so, all of those people who have An Opinion but literally know nothing on the topic), be willing to be uncomfortable and strong in what you believe in and do, and to set and respect boundaries. It's a call to get comfortable being uncomfortable. About belonging to yourself, rather than trying to fit in. Does this book address some really meaty stuff it could have (think: systems of oppression)? Nope. There are weak spots. It's not big or deep enough. But it's a start. It's stepping out into that uncomfortable wilderness to begin a much-needed dialog and action toward letting go of the destructive \"us\" vs \"them\" dynamics. The book isn't about changing the world. It's about changing yourself to be a better member of the world."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1521829-chris", "userReview": "I used to be obsessed with politics. Every Sunday morning would be spent with \"Meet the Press\" and \"Face the Nation.\" But somewhere in the ensuing years, things changed. While I talk with my friends face to face every Friday evening about the past week's news, I have made a vow never to discuss or post anything online about politics. Nope, never again. I made a comment on Facebook regarding my views on the Electoral College soon after last fall's election and slunk away after I felt I was taken to task publicly. The painful feelings of being spoken to (written to?) that way still smart and have yet to disappear. I believe a level of civility has disappeared with the advent of social media; people are much more apt to hide behind a computer screen and spout off opinions, not caring what someone else thinks or feels. Sadly, even friends. As Brown writes, \"Today we are edging closer and closer to a world where political and ideological discourse has become an exercise in dehumanization.\" Facebook has become such a volatile place, that I spend most of my time on Instagram. Lovely photos don't get political. I was familiar with Brown, but had never read one of her books. I actually wasn't even going to write a review. But this morning, something clicked in me. As Oprah would say, it was my \"aha moment.\" I actually thought this was a self-help book about loneliness, and it is, but not in that way. Being in Brene Brown's wilderness, to me, is a metaphor for being \"out there,\" in public, on social media, being vulnerable and open with your beliefs and truth. And yes, sometimes that is lonely. True belonging and fitting in sometimes is lonely. Finding the courage to speak your truth is sometimes lonely. This isn't a book about Democrats, Republicans, liberals, or conservative. It is about humans and how can we all get along. \"People are hard to hate close up. Move in.\" \"Speak truth to BS. Be Civil.\"\"Hold hands. With strangers.\"\"Strong back. Soft front. Wild heart.\"As the wise Maya Angelou writes and is quoted several times in the book, \"You are only free when you realize you belong no place\u2014you belong every place\u2014no place at all.

The reward is great.\""}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "Still 5 stars after my re-read. She has a great message that seems relevant in today's world. I especially loved the part about having integrity and what that looks like. We need more of that especially in the political arena.------------------------------------------I can see how people either love this book or hate it. I, for one, loved it. I could relate to her message and at the same time, I felt I was learning something. Both of those together, gets 5 stars and I would read this again.We are definitely in different camps on some of the topics she mentioned, but she wasn't hostile or pointing fingers. The world, especially when considering the current political climate, could use more of that. I wasn't familiar with who the author was before reading this. I've read some of the other reviews and found out she was more books.....so woohoo....I need to log into my library and see what they have.

Her stuff is always so good!! This one was so short that after reading it, I bought the audiobook and listened to it. So good both times!! I love when she narrates her own stuff. While after a reading everything she's put out, most of her stuff does get a tad repetitive, this was the exception. Everything here feels so fresh and new.

Impossible to. Instead, I'll list a few favorite parts. Knowing this is different for everyone who reads. When Brene' storytells the moment she recognized not 'belonging' to her family. Tears well up. Turned off the audio book. Visited her Instagram page sifting for comfort where others would vibe similar. Left a message for her and the page. Feeling less alone. Start listing to the book againWrapping myself around self incrimination and wanting to feel ashamed of truth I recognize throughout the book. Hearing her ask me, 'why?' Resembles how she hears the voices of others. Like, Maya Angelo. This is why I like audio books. Especially with her. I hear her voice. Overlap my fears and tears. This comforts meHer epiphany of what the Maya Angelo quote means for herself is awesome! Proves the journey may have twists and turns. Full of all sorts of happenstances. Some our own doing when we did what we thought would work. If we keep searching for the truth of something that conflicts with our sense of self we eventually find the 'wilderness' and belonging to ourselves. You'll have to read the book to relate The interview with Viola Davis meant another click of the book off. Tears welling up. Visiting Viola's Instagram page. Leaving a heart felt thank you for her courage and appreciation for lighting the path a little brighter for meThe interview of junior high students at the end. Fitting in verses belonging and their take on not belonging at home ... AGAIN, tearing up. Turn off the book. Reflect. By this point, after immersing myself for a couple of days I felt more secure in where I am. Understanding the wilderness a lot better. My place in it Showing up in the world will never be the same 'practicing being in the wilderness' every day from now on. Especially, 'not searching for confirmation I don't belong' any longer My whole life timelines itself reading this book. I could see where moments of my life helped set the course. Eventually, becoming my doing. No more The VA is helping me sort through how the events of my military service caused a disability my brain struggles with. After hearing this book I feel confident these struggles won't keep me from belonging to myself and 'You only are free when you realize you belong no place \u2014 you belong every place \u2014 no place at all.'

It was such a good reminder of how I want to human on this planet. I listened to it on audio book. It was great because she reads it herself and has a great presence. I also had it on Kindle, but I bought a hard copy because there were so many quotes that I wanted to highlight and underline. It was a great reminder of how to live boldly in life and with integrity. It also reminded me to be kind and not forget other people's humanity. It's a lot of stuff that makes common sense, but these are great reminders with her clear voice. I also find her own acknowledgement of her imperfections to be so validating and relatable. I imagine I will reread it more than once."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4843124-melanie", "userReview": "I enjoyed some of Brene Brown's ideas and thoughts and the underlying research for this book. I liked the juxtaposition of belonging versus following your own moral compass, yet I have to admit that at times she lost me a bit. My main gripe with the book is that I felt that it is was more \"content creation\" for her readership and lacked a bit of the umph and depth of some of her other books. Still I liked it and some parts felt like a bit of a gut wrenching, kick in the backside moment and as an audiobook of just 4 and a bit hours a nice interlude. She reads it herself and she is rather good at doing that."}], "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - A timely and important new book that challenges everything we think we know about cultivating true belonging in our communities, organizations, and culture, from the #1 bestselling author of Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, and The Gifts of Imperfection\"True belonging doesn't require us to change who we are. It requires us to be who we are.\" Social scientist Brene Brown, PhD, LMSW, has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives--experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame, and empathy. In Braving the Wilderness,  Brown redefines what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarization. With her trademark mix of research, storytelling, and honesty, Brown will again change the cultural conversation while mapping a clear path to true belonging.Brown argues that we're experiencing a spiritual crisis of disconnection, and introduces four practices of true belonging that challenge everything we believe about ourselves and each other. She writes, \"True belonging requires us to believe in and belong to ourselves so fully that we can find sacredness both in being a part of something and in standing alone when necessary. But in a culture that's rife with perfectionism and pleasing, and with the erosion of civility, it's easy to stay quiet, hide in our ideological bunkers, or fit in rather than show up as our true selves and brave the wilderness of uncertainty and criticism. But true belonging is not something we negotiate or accomplish with others; it's a daily practice that demands integrity and authenticity. It's a personal commitment that we carry in our hearts.\" Brown offers us the clarity and courage we need to find our way back to ourselves and to each other. And that path cuts right through the wilderness. Brown writes, \"The wilderness is an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching. It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. But it turns out to be the place of true belonging, and it's the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.\"Praise for Brene Brown's Rising Strong\"[Brown's] research and work have given us a new vocabulary, a way to talk with each other about the ideas and feelings and fears we've all had but haven't quite known how to articulate. . . . [She] empowers us each to be a little more courageous.\"\n--The Huffington Post", "title": "Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34565022-braving-the-wilderness", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1501487391l/34565022.jpg", "reviews": 2427, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/162578.Bren_Brown", "name": "Bren\u00e9 Brown"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Self Help", "Psychology", "Audiobook"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34565022-braving-the-wilderness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34556334-braving-the-wilderness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35002997-braving-the-wilderness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588356-daring-greatly", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7015403-the-gifts-of-imperfection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23317538-rising-strong", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/279308.I_Thought_It_Was_Just_Me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23500254-the-power-of-vulnerability"]}
