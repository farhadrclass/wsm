He must have wanted such a toy for a long time, as toys were a luxury in our poor household, that he calls her attention and says mother, that's a nice toy isn't it? My mother said yes, it is a nice toy. Then my brother adds, but we can't buy it because we don't have money? Yes, we can't, we don't have money, she says. Forty years after it happened, my mother still recalls it. It must have broken her heart that her son had to be fully conscious of want at such a young age. That brother of mine grew up a very frugal man, quite unlike my other brother, who was shielded from the enfeebling effects of our poverty that he grew up a spendthrift, buys books like there is no tomorrow and is as generous as the sun on a hot summer day. His grand birthday celebrations are almost always like historical events.Anyway, this is a book by a Canadian author, Gabrielle Roy. She was born and educated in Manitoba where my only sister, who doesn't read anything but her patients' charts, is based now. What a waste. If we can exchange places, I most likely would check out where Gabrielle Roy had lived or studied in Manitoba, and maybe get an idea where she got the wonderful insights which helped her write this extraordinary novel.Florentine, the protagonist, is a 19-year-old waitress in a small diner/store. She's skinny because she (the eldest) and her eight siblings have very poor nourishment. Her father, Azarius, is a taxi driver. He's in and out of jobs. Well-meaning and kind, he does not have much luck, however. He has had many grand schemes to earn money which all failed. He and his wife Rose-Anna are just in their early 40's. They live in the slums in Montreal (the story is set during the Great Depression, just before the second world war). Rose-Anna is again with a child, the 13th pregnancy of her young life. Three of her children had died during infancy.There are a lot of novels about the poor and about being poor. But what makes this book different, I think, is the author's remarkable understanding of how the poor thinks and feels. She knows how it is to be a young woman in love, but poor, so that the object of her longing would be both attracted by her beauty and repulsed by her poverty; or how it is to be a mother, who love her children, but does not have enough to feed and clothe them all properly. Details which only those who are poor, or had been poor, would notice sear the pages of the book. There were moments when I felt like taking all of my money from my wallet, insert the same inside the book's pages and hope that this poor family can take the cash and spend them for their needs.There are several scenes here that will strike you as so true, but I have a favorite because it reminds me of my young brother and the toy our mother couldn't buy for him.The mother, Rose-Anna, decides to leave the house one day to look for a new house they can rent as they are about to be evicted from their present dwelling. As she was leaving, one of her small children, a 6-year-old boy named Daniel who is often weak and with a fever (unknown to them, he has leukemia) asks her several times to buy him a tin flute. He had long wanted one.Rose-Anna walked all day but failed to find a house they can afford to rent from the meager budget they have which comes mostly from Florentine's wages and her husband's (if he has work). On her way home, pregnant, hungry and tired, Rose-Anna decides to drop by the diner/store where Florentine works. She asks only for a cup of coffee \"to perk her up\" a little, but Florentine knows her mother is hungry and gets her a chicken meal which costs only forty cents(on sale that day) and insists that she eats it. As Rose-Anna was eating all she could think of is how expensive the meal is, and with forty cents she can prepare something at home more plentiful and more filling. After eating the chicken meal, Florentine also serves her a piece of pie which Rose-Anna would not have eaten had Florentine not told her that the pie is already included in the chicken meal. Later, as Rose-Anna was about to leave, Florentine also gave her two dollars--the tips she had earned for the day. Then Florentine--\"saw her mother's piteous, beaten look, full of gratitude and admiration. She saw her mother rise painfully and leave, skirting the counters and stopping here and there to touch an object or feel a piece of material.\"Her mother! Rose-Anna seemed very old to her. She moved slowly and her tight coat made her stomach bulge out. With two extra dollars hidden deep in her bag, the bag held close to her side, she was less sure of herself than before. Pots and pans, bolts of material, all the things she had long denied herself the privilege of looking at, fascinated her. Countless yearnings swelled within her, but she went steadily on her way, the money that had given rise to them buried in her pocketbook. Certainly she was poorer now than when she had entered the store.\"As she watched this silent drama, all Florentine's joy was turned to bitterness. The rapture she had felt in being generous and unselfish gave way to a sense of aching frustration. It had been a total loss, completely useless. It was a drop of water in the desert of their lives.\"At the other end of the store, Rose-Anna had stopped at the toy counter, and picked up a little tin flute. As a salesgirl approached, however, she put it down hastily, and Florentine knew that Daniel's desire for the flute would never be any closer to realization than this. Her mother's good intention was quickly suppressed. Likewise between her desire to help Rose-Anna and the peace of mind her mother would probably never have, nothing would be left but the aching memory of a good intention. If she alone could escape from their narrow life, that would be a great achievement, but even for her it was very hard. She would have been happy to take her family with her and raise them also to a position of ease and comfort, but she knew that it was useless to think of it.\"She forced herself to smile at her mother, who seemed to be asking her advice: 'Should I buy the flute, the pretty little toy flute, or should I buy stockings, underwear, food? Which is more important? A flute like a ray of sunshine for a sick child, a happy flute to make sounds of joy, or food on the table? Tell me which is more important, Florentine?'\"Florentine brought herself to smile once more as Rose-Anna, deciding at length to leave the store, waved goodbye, but by that time she was ready to rip all her good intentions to shreds, like a useless rag.\""}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "Originally titled Bonheur d'occasion (trans. Second-hand Happiness), The Tin Flute is the vivid story of the working poor in Quebec during World War II. The story begins with the eldest daughter, Florentine, who works in the Five and Ten in order to help support her parents. She falls for a machinist, Jean, who agrees to date her merely to benefit himself. His friend, Emmanuel, in the meantime, falls for Florentine who has eyes only for Jean. As the Afterword (Philip Stratford) mentions, Florentine was Gabrielle Roy's first and foremost character for the story, but Florentine's mother Rose-Anna pushed her way into the story and was there to stay. Lucky for us, the readers, as Rose-Anna is truly the heart and soul of the entire story. There would be no Florentine without Rose-Anna, nor would Florentine's many siblings exist. Mother holds the story together. She is the glue.The story is told from the perspectives of the different characters, and because of this the reader walks away feeling a little bruised around the edges. Not since Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath have I finished a book feeling like I've just suffered with an entire family. Like Steinbeck did for the American literary landscape of the Great Depression, so does Gabrielle Roy for the Canadian slums of Montreal of World War II. The characters could be real people, with real reactions and real hopes and real fears. The situations, though perhaps dated at times, are not too far removed from the ones imagined by most contemporary readers.Wonderful story, deserving of its place on the 1,001 Books to Read Before You Die list. But if a happy ending is ones goal for picking up this book, you will be sorely disappointed. Life isn't always a bushel of cherries."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth (Alaska)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska", "userReview": "This is a book that got stronger as I read further into it. The novel takes place right at the end of the depression and the beginning of WWII. The LaCosse family at the center of the novel has gotten poorer as the years - and the children - added up. It was this poverty that that prevailed.She was brooding over the fact that poverty is like a pain, dormant and not unbearable as long as you don't move about too much. You grow used to it, you end up by paying no attention to it. But once you presume to bring it out in the daylight, it becomes terrifying, you see it at last in all its squalor and you shrink from exposing it to the sun.I might have wanted more from the prose, and I was tempted to blame the translator. Then I remembered that I'm not likely to give the translator credit when I do like the prose, so maybe I should treat them fairly. I might have wanted a bit more in terms of characterization, but those became clearer as I got deeper into the novel. I never really felt comfortable, never felt connected to the characters or invested in the future that was being revealed. Still, I couldn't put it down for the last 50 pages. I needed to know how all of the issues were resolved. I wanted to like it more, but it's just a strong 3-stars for me."}, {"userName": "Orla Hegarty", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3610259-orla-hegarty", "userReview": "This book is an important fictionalized version of herstory that sadly reflects many of the same issues we have in society today."}, {"userName": "Margaret Virany", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7226310-margaret-virany", "userReview": "Gabrielle Roy has marvelous powers of description that make winter wind, snow, cold and choking city smoke descend and engulf the reader as well as her fictional characters. Just as invasive are her powers of discernment which take the reader right inside the thoughts and desperation of a family caught inside the slums of Montreal during the depression that preceded world war two. This is a Canadian classic, one of the finest books ever written. However, don't expect to lift your head from its last page feeling any more optimistic about life than you did before."}, {"userName": "C.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10501026-c", "userReview": "I am of two poles like Gabrielle Roy: Winnipeg-born, with everything we needed but our parents struggled. I encountered one distant resemblance to the Lacasses of \u201cThe Tin Flute\u201d, the most destitute family about whom I've read. Not hitting the right career and financial plan in the beginning, was like a tire that kept puncturing, a black hole. Throw money at the Lacasses and it got sucked up. One of the reasons this award-winning d\u00e9but receives three stars from me, is disbelief that the Father and children did not earn money somehow. A catholic place like Montr\u00e9al in 1945 was ripe for babysitting! The Mother worked but was too often pregnant. That she was run ragged at home, I don't accept. No kids did dishes, cleaned, or cooked? She wouldn't ask her Mother or brothers for help?The other reason for moderately grading an admirable, complex literary coup is that we never like the eldest daughter, Florentine. Gabrielle gives voice to everyone's thoughts, even the awful Jean L\u00e9vesque, whom Florentine asininely wanted to impress because he wasn't a lover's type. When a story solidifies, after a few chapters of snapshots, she and her Mother are the protagonists. We loathe her sons Eug\u00e8ne and Phillip and Emmanuel would be an adorable beau, if he wasn't as stupid about love as Florentine, in his own way. He becomes her husband, even though his friend, Jean attracted her by being the first to kiss her. We want Florentine to wizen up, whom we admire as her family's sole breadwinner! WWII sees the poorest still reeling from the 1930s. Going to war in aid of England in France, well before Americans, provided jobs and family allowance cheques.The most poignant example of a negative being a boon is Daniel in a hospital. His Mother saw him with colouring books, blocks, and a tin flute he wanted; thinly-matched English title of \u201cBonheur D'Occasion\u201d. He received in one day, more toys than he ever had. Imagine a hospital being superior to a home life! In their rental homes, one or two kids had rooms, everyone else slept on cots, stowed by day. I forgive Florentine vanity about how she appears and dresses, after doing without. I was too young to remember this film, shown in my French school. It abounds in great discussion fodder, grasped best by adults. I only recalled that it was grim and dreaded reading it all these years. I am happy to discover that it is a highly readable story, that carries you along, outside of unlikeable characters. It concludes with hope, growth, and improvement. However the original title's meaning is more apt, for a book that isn't about music. It means: \u201coccasional happiness\u201d."}, {"userName": "Dirck de Lint", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14197371-dirck-de-lint", "userReview": "I should rather pull a toe off than read this book again.

I feel like not a lot happens, and a lot of the characters aren't very likeable, but I really liked this book. The language is incredibly artful, and I found myself just underlining random sections of the page that struck me as being particularly beautiful. The depiction of the poor was very heart wrenching and combined with some of the sentimental family/love stuff and the french flavour of Montreal, makes this book feel like a Canadian version of Les Miserables (my favourite book!). The early-WWII atmosphere with the recruitment efforts and characters leaving to join the army does a great job of affecting my emotions as I read it. It's just the tragedy of war, mixed with the thrill of adventure, the sense of duty, and the need for money by any means really combine to make a good emotional cocktail in a story that already does a good job of touching emotions.As far as characters go, I wasn't a big fan of Florentine or Jean. I found both of them to be irritating and frustrating characters (though they were certainly well drawn by the author). I did like Emmanuel a lot and also Rose-Anna and Azarius quite a bit. Rose-Anna is such a tragic figure (a very poor mother of 12 children with a husband who won't work) and I found her to be my biggest connection throughout the story. But even though she was suffering because of Azarius' lazy ways, it was hard to hate him because it made sense why he was lazy and poor. One of the more tragic lines in the story comes from the description of Azarius by Florentine towards the end of the story where she says he just never had good luck. It isn't that Azarius never tried, or that his decisions were particularly bad... it's just he had terrible timing and nothing really quite worked out. This book is really excellent for a lot of reasons but I have one major complaint which prevents it from being a 5 star book. I like a book with a driving plot. Les Miserables definitely had long sections of melancholic emotions and overdone character development, but things in that book were constantly moving forward. In The TIn Flute, you could read 100 pages and nothing has really happened except for a conversation or two inside of a restaurant. I still liked it alot and would definitely recommend it to a certain type of reader, but I know I would've liked it more with a stronger plot."}, {"userName": "An Te Chu", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32496250-an-te-chu", "userReview": "Rose Anne feels like the only character with depth.

Roy is a great writer, able to set an entire scene in a sentence, and displaying deep psychological sensitivity. At times the book feels interminable - there's not much of a plot and the big 'reveal' in the penultimate chapter was anti-climactic as I totally saw that coming.

You also accumulate a lot of books, some of which you get around to reading at some point. Others end up being those books that sit on your bookshelves and get packed up in boxes and moved to your next apartment, house, or bedsit, depending on where you are in life.By my reckoning, my copy of Gabrielle Roy\u2019s The Tin Flute was moved about 18 times. The last time I remember seeing it in my bookcase was three years ago, when we lived in Guelph and were moving to Victoria. At that point I decided I was probably never going to read it and gave it to a friend. A few days ago, continuing with my 1001 Books reading, I picked it up from the library. It\u2019s a fascinating read.I think what held me back from reading this, Roy\u2019s first novel, was the title \u2013 I got it into my head that it was a military story, not my first choice when it comes to reading for pleasure. I don\u2019t know why I thought that, except for the fact that it\u2019s set at the beginning of World War II. (I may have been confusing it with The Tin Drum, by Gunter Grass.) The military does play a part, in that several of the young men \u2013 and one older one \u2013 enlist, but it\u2019s really a backdrop to a story of poverty and struggle in the slums of Montreal.Which makes it sound depressing. Well, it\u2019s not a knee-slapper. But it\u2019s one of those books whose characters do more than simply come alive\u2026they remain in your head after you\u2019ve finished the book. You find yourself wondering how things will work out for Florentine, the vain, self-doubting young waitress who falls for the wrong man and finds herself in an all-too-familiar predicament \u2013 made worse by the fact that this is 1939 and the sexual revolution is three decades away. Her life, and that of her family and neighbours, is dictated by poverty and the Church, not necessarily in that order. Her tastes are superficial and naive, and her motives not particularly altruistic, except where her mother is concerned. Yet Roy draws her with such tenderness, such insight, that you feel for the girl. You want her to succeed, even though you\u2019re pretty sure that, in the end, her life will turn out very much like her mother\u2019s \u2013 too many children and too few choices.Her mother, Rose-Anna, was originally intended as a secondary character, but as often happens when creating a narrative, she developed into a complex and fascinating figure in her own right. Pregnant with her 12th child (yes, 12th \u2013 this is 1930s Quebec, remember) she juggles the demands of a hungry, needy family. Her reward is to lose one child to the army, another to illness, and another to a marriage based on a lie. Eugene, her oldest son, signs up to fight in order that his mother will receive a monthly cheque from the government. Her husband, Azarius, is weak and a dreamer; in the end he recovers his self-worth by enlisting, the only way he can see to finally provide his wife with a reasonable income.I\u2019ve said the war is a backdrop to the story, and it is, but Roy also explores the motives behind all those young men leaping into uniform to sacrifice themselves for their country. They are all driven by need \u2013 financial in many cases, as this is the tail end of the Depression and jobs are hard to come by. But money isn\u2019t the only reason \u2013 Quebec at the time still has strong links to France, the \u201cmother country\u201d, even though most of its inhabitants have never set foot in the country. For many, it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2013 for others, especially the working-class poor living in the Saint-Henri slums of Montreal, it\u2019s one way out of a miserable existence.The Tin Flute is considered Montreal\u2019s first urban novel. Written in French and translated into English shortly afterwards, it won both the Governor-General\u2019s Award and the Prix Femina of France. Its publication left the old Quebec behind for ever \u2013 the old seigneurial system of farms and habitants dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. As Philip Stratford writes in the afterword to my copy, \u201cIt banished forever the folkloric, romanticized image of the province which had changed little in the previous three centuries. It set Montreal squarely in the mainstream of subsequent fiction.\u201dI\u2019m glad I finally got around to reading it.

And ridicule I did ;) I you ever get the feeling for some dramatic clean soap this is it .This is the first time I've given a book three stars after a ridicule read \ud83d\ude02 So on to the book ;The tin flute tells the tragically heart wrenching ( tragically pitiful and hilarious ) story of Florentine a French Canadian girl who waitresses during world war two . Although the war is not the theme of the novel it does effect the story in many ways .Florentine although spoiled and entitled works to provide for a large family of about thirteen including her parents, very begrudgingly I might add . Florentine both prides herself on the attention of men and hates them as she receives attentions and complements . She says she hates the way men throw themselves at her but yet in the middle of complaining about men asking her on dates in pops Jean .  She tells him flat out to not even ask her out . Jean however has no intention of asking her out but she baits and irritates him until he asks her .Little does Florentine know that he entirely regrets even asking her , hr finds her much to skinny and irritating.Meanwhile little does Jean know that Florentine begins to grow majorly obsessed with this handsome and rich man .......Now it's time for me to rant about my least favourite person in this book \ud83e\udd42Today's lucky winner is Florentine !! I liked Florentine for about the first five chapters ....Nope not at all she was a monster form her first thought .She threw herself at Jean ,then when he refused her advances she nagged him until he consented to go on a date .She majorly contrasted with her siblings . Whenever she had the money she bought herself new whatever she wanted while her siblings lived in patched rags .She was absolutely irritating in genres she lived and breathed only to satisfy her every whim . Shes a melodramatic ,man eating , two timing , spoiled , drama loving , brat.And for those of you who think that's mean I could've said a lot worse \ud83d\ude02Thanks for reading !Makayla \u2764\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1560497-meredith", "userReview": "[Azarius Lacasse decides to enlist in the army, and with any luck he will be killed, thus freeing his family from his disastrous influence.

It was not. It was a working class neighbourhood built near the jobs of the Lachine Canal and the railroads. There were (and are) rough parts and nice parts. The entire neighbourhood is gentrifying with much of it being called Griffintown in terms of restaurants and bars.The novel captures the district, the times, including the despair, the fear and the hope.It is a clear indicator of why we need to circulate money in hard times.Notes: Page 90: Year after year this search went on, as rents went up and decent housing grew harder and harder to find.94: A passing truck just missed her, and she looked up more surprised than terrified, like an absent- minded accountant disturbed at his books.95: Covenant Street\u2026this was a peaceful avenue of middle class houses. 96: It wasn\u2019t often that she prayed directly to God. She preferred to ask the intercession of saints that were familiar through statues and pictures. 116: \u2026she had kept her peasant horror of paying in a restaurant for a meal she could prepare at home for half the price.128: Conversation was desultory along the wall. Guests from the city were carrying most of the burden ; those from St. Henri were mainly tongue-tied.139: I\u2019ll do the first nine Fridays of the month as well. 289: For no part of Montreal has kept its well-defined limits or its special, narrow, characteristic village life as St. Henri has done.Only in the afterword does the word slum appear. Take it out!The book could have used a strong editor but for the time it was revolutionary.

This is heavy. The characters, the setting, the politics...all so well described and developed. I can\u2019t believe this was an author\u2019s first novel. It\u2019s heart wrenching, and evokes empathy for the characters, and the conditions of their time. It seemed so well researched, and so in tune with human nature.To me, it wasn\u2019t just a focus on one character, but a handful of characters centred around the one family. I liked having the other perspectives given background and space of their own. With their strengths, and human weaknesses, and decisions that affect the rest of their lives..My favourite chapter is when Emmanuel returns to St. Henri and wanders the streets that evening, contemplating the price of a life...in a world heavily shadowed by the start of the Second World War, and in world weary of poverty and struggle...hence men \u2018bought\u2019 into serving their country, or joining/profiting for other potential reasons...The ending was a good finale, in that you knew a whole host of other troubles would face these characters as they leapt to new stages in their lives, but it was sufficient to leave it there.The English translation is fantastic, the language flowing so beautifully, as I\u2019m assuming it does in French.When we first moved to Winnipeg, we happened across one of the authors homes, which was to be my first knowledge of this French-Canadian author. After I heard about this award-winning novel, I bought a second-hand copy and finally read it, and glad I did. I\u2019m sure it could be studied and read several times to grasp all the nuances. However, be aware that the story itself is depressing, and for that reason I probably won\u2019t read it again."}, {"userName": "Tom Gray", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78620265-tom-gray", "userReview": "The Tin Flute\" is a novel of amazing insight. It is a novel of life in Montreal in winter and spring of 1940 as World War 2 began to life the poverty of the Great Depression. It is also a novel that goes beyond that to universal insight. It is a novel in which description not plot predominates and the descriptions of the internal awareness of the characters and the physical surroundings is both deep and rich. This novel won many prizes, including the Governor General's Award, and it surely deserved them all. It is a first rate novel by a first rate writer.This novel was assigned in my high school English class in either grade 11 or grade 12 over 50 years ago. It stood in teh back if my mind for all of those years. i don't know if I even read much of it back then. I took it up as part of my retirement project to discover the literature that the school tried to teach my back then. I am very glad to be doing that and the depth and beauty of this novel in particular shows me what I missed fro all of those years. i wasn't mature enough to appreciate the novel back then. i am glad that I can appreciate it now."}, {"userName": "Heep", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7467322-heep", "userReview": "Well, I didn't finish it. There comes a point in life when you have to question whether it is worth devoting time freely to things you don't really enjoy. I'm not talking about duties or moral compulsions such as walking a dog on a cold night or going to work. I am talking about activities that are completely voluntary. Unfortunately, I found this book tedious. The fact that this national classic was started on the 150th anniversary of Confederation, and that I am engaged in a monumental Canadian reading challenge is not enough to compel me to slog through the entire work. Moreover, the historic descriptions of my home city, Montreal, did not sweeten the pot. Frankly, Mordecai Richler does a much better job satiating that craving. I have moved on to Stephen Leacock and could not be happier or more satisfied with my seeming good judgement. Truly, this is a great nation made up with decisive and rational citizens."}], "description": "The Tin Flute, Gabrielle Roy\u2019s first novel, is a classic of Canadian fiction.
