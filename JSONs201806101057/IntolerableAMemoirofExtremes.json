He dedicates the book \u201cto Toronto, for giving me what I\u2019ve been looking for: a home.\u201dNow a professor at Ryerson University and a former theatre critic for the national Globe and Mail (disclosure: we are friends, both having covered the theatre beat for different publications), the author effectively captures his sense of dislocation: he wants to be loyal to his family (he was the youngest of 11 children), and is obviously concerned for their well-being, and yet he must be true to himself. His sensitivity is keen, especially to his female siblings, who once wore miniskirts and bikinis at the beach and gradually saw their freedoms stripped away as they covered up their bodies with the burqa.Although not every member of his family comes alive \u2013 how could they, with so many? \u2013 he does sketch out effective and moving portraits of his parents and their evolving relationship. It\u2019s significant that the book opens with his mother, \u201can illiterate shepherdess.\u201d Her lack of education would become a wedge between her and her husband, a clever entrepreneur whose love of England stoked his future writer son\u2019s imagination. But his mother also intuitively knows that her sensitive boy has more of a future abroad.There\u2019s lots of historical information about the changing developments in the Middle East, up to and including the significance of the Arab Spring movement, in which his now educated and underemployed nieces and nephews were involved. One of the most fascinating elements of the book is seeing him chronicle his evolving sexual feelings, for Arab pop stars at first but then, gradually, Western ones. It\u2019s amazing that he should have connected to gay icons like Barbra Streisand and Olivia Newton John at such a young age, and in such a different culture. Is there something universally \u201ccampy\u201d about them? He also informs us that the idea of \u201ccoming out\u201d is a Western phenomenon. It doesn\u2019t apply in the Middle East. But some questions remain: what would have happened had he come out? What were the implications? We\u2019re given some information, rumours about people, but more concrete details would have helped. (In this context, the Western concept of \"post-gay\" seems terribly flippant.)A coda or epilogue would have been interesting. Surely after the publication of chapters of this book, available online, his family would have learned of his sexuality. Was there any result? Silence? Recrimination? Perhaps the author is being discreet and private, but the absence feels like a presence. In addition, a stronger editor could have tightened some of the prose, ridding it of the occasional clich\u00e9. In one paragraph Al-Solaylee tells us his mother \u201ccried for days on end\u201d and that his sisters \u201cbreathed a sigh of relief\u2026 for they knew they\u2019d follow in his footsteps\u2026\u201dStill, this is an important, necessary book about things we often take for granted: family, freedom and the idea of home."}, {"userName": "Marieke", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke", "userReview": "Finally getting underway with reading the books for this year's Canada Reads debates, my most favorite book event ever. This year \"Canada Reads 2015 is all about books that can change perspectives, challenge stereotypes and illuminate issues.\" I decided to read Intolerable first because of Yemen, a country I have a strange vicarious connection with. On the surface the book seems to meet the theme's criteria: change perspectives and challenge stereotypes--Arab immigrants to the West face a lot of stereotypes but this book also deals with being gay in a society that doesn't condone it; and illuminate issues--what in the world is happening to Yemen and does the West have an obligation to help?But...this book fell flat for me. This last chapter saved it for me, but otherwise I just didn't feel very engaged. I thought the author was rather repetitive about things, which annoyed me. I think it would have been a stronger book if he had interviewed his family so we could see his story from their perspective too, rather than him just telling us what he thought they thought. We sometimes got their view of what happened to their family but not often enough. This bothered me because the author is a journalist. Their family story is truly a saga, but I don't think that really came through in this telling.Another reviewer also lamented the absence of Canada/Toronto--I agree. Other than hearing how much he loves Toronto, we don't ever get a real sense of his transition to life there. We go through some paces with him...finding a job, moving apartments, some lovers and a breakup briefly mentioned, but I did not think there was not enough there to create the contrast between life in North America and Yemen for me to really feel grabbed by his story. Everything felt rather glossed over. I imagine this book was incredibly difficult to write; as a reader I wish he had truly shared that pain with me.I'll be curious to see how well this book gets defended but even without having read the other selections, I'm doubtful this one will be selected as the one all of Canada should read."}, {"userName": "David Hallman", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5292886-david-hallman", "userReview": "The Story Behind the StoryThere is no doubt that Kamal Al-Solaylee\u2019s new book \u201cIntolerable \u2013 A Memoir of Extremes\u201d has all the elements of a fascinating biographical and socio-historical epic: a young boy growing up in an Arabic family in Yemen, Egypt, and Lebanon that gets caught up in the economic, religious, and political upheavals of the region over the past fifty years; his fascination with the allure of western pop and artistic culture that is denigrated by family members and his society; a dawning sense of his gay sexual identify and his desperate struggle to liberate himself from the strictures of his upbringing so as to carve for himself a life in a different part of the world where he can pursue freely his intellectual and emotional aspirations.\u201cIntolerable\u201d hopefully will be adapted for the screen some day. It would make a great film.But I found myself drawn not so much to the dramatic narrative as to\u2014I\u2019m not sure what to call it\u2014the backstory or the subtext or the metastory. I was profoundly moved by Al-Solaylee\u2019s on-going internal monologue as he struggles to understand what is happening to him and his world, grapples mightily with the limited options available to him to escape from what he finds so intolerable, and then, most poignantly, deals with the consequences of his decisions as they relate to his self-induced separation from his family and cultural roots.This on-going personal reflection by Al-Solaylee about the psychological and ethical dimensions of his life choices is often heart wrenching for us as readers to witness. While he is thrilled with the life that he eventually creates for himself in his new adopted home of Toronto, his enthusiasm is overlaid by two dampeners: firstly, a persistent melancholy because of the suffering that his displacement has caused to his family, particularly his mother and his sisters, that is compounded by a deterioration in his family\u2019s quality of life as a result of the political upheavals in the region; and secondly, an existential insecurity linked to his self-identity as Arabic and his feelings about Arabic culture which fluctuate dramatically over the course of the story.To bear one\u2019s soul in public like Al-Solaylee has done requires a great deal of guts. It can also be cathartic.I speak from experience. After my long-term partner died suddenly from cancer, I wrote a memoir \u201cAugust Farewell\u201d in which I detailed the sixteen days between Bill\u2019s diagnosis and his death and integrated into the chronology vignettes from our thirty-three years together as a gay couple. Writing, for those of us who feel drawn to it, can help us make sense of the vicissitudes of life. But of even more consequence, at least for me, are the intimate conversations and depth of relationships with readers who respond to our soul-bearing.My fondest wish for Kamal Al-Solaylee is that he will find in having written and published \u201cIntolerable\u201d some measure of this gratification at both the personal and relational levels.* * *For information on Kamal Al-Solaylee\u2019s \u201cIntolerable \u2013 A Memoir of Extremes\u201d see http://amzn.to/SbKkap For information on my memoir \u201cAugust Farewell\u201d see my website http://DavidGHallman.com"}, {"userName": "Bob Paterson-watt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25308137-bob-paterson-watt", "userReview": "While the book was not exactly as bad a read as the first word of the title, and while I did learn a thing or two about Yemen and the unravelling of a vibrant open society, I felt like the author was bored while writing this memoir. I was not engaged by his story, not interested in the familial relationships he described, because they all simply stayed on the page, two-dimensional at best.

I felt like I learned a lot about Yemen and what it is like to grow up in the Middle East if you are gay. That, to me, was the most interesting part of the book. At times, I really disliked the narrator (author). I know that he had to leave, for his own reasons, and I don't begrudge him for that. However, I felt that he was sometimes really harsh on his relatives and family members. By the end of the book, he realizes that even though he tried to flee the Middle East, he wasn't able to. So I am very conflicted in my feelings about this book, which means that I think it's a great pick for Canada Reads. There's a lot to debate and discuss. I don't think this book will win, and I think some of the other panellists will also have problems with the narrator/author, because he doesn't come across as particularly likeable."}, {"userName": "Mj", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5706631-mj", "userReview": "Intolerable is the perfect name for this memoir. It was intolerable for the author to live in repressive countries where homosexually was not allowed or even acknowledged. Equally intolerable was the poverty and living condition in his birth country of Yemen before he left, especially for his mother and sisters living under very strict orthodox rules.The personal story and the country story are both shared throughout. The personal story is written in a sensitive, cathartic manner. The intimacies and feelings shared are open and raw \u2013 almost too much so. At times I felt like a bit of a voyeur. Not in a graphic or sexual way. It is because the author shares his vulnerabilities, deepest feelings and intimate thoughts with such abandon and without the usual boundaries. Sometimes I felt like I was intruding into too private a space.This memoir had sort of a dual personality. For me the book shifted back and forth between very raw and open to very clinical and informational. As a result, it touched me and I also learned a lot. The author, Kamal Al-Kaman, is the youngest of 11 children born in Yemen. His story starts with his early years growing up in a close-knit, well-to-do family. His father was a business man, who spent time in England and valued Western ways. He encouraged freedom and education for his entire family, including his many daughters. Al-Kaman\u2019s mother grew up in a rural village, was smart and resourceful, loving and devoted to caring for her family and home. Theirs was a cosmopolitan, modern family that frequented the arts, read a great deal, liked American music, movies and magazines and flew regularly to other countries for family vacations.Al-Kaman estimates that in less than twenty years (from the 50\u2019s through the 70\u2019s) things radically changed throughout the Middle East, but especially in Yemen as orthodox beliefs or Radical Islam became more prevalent, powerful and controlling. His sisters went from wearing bikinis on summer vacations and shopping with their girlfriends for the latest fashions and cosmetics to home confinement and wearing burqas that fully covered them whenever they left home with their required male chaperone. What made this especially sad was that much of these restrictions were imposed by their own brothers, first one, and then another, who adopted and enforced these radical fundamentalist rules.Most of the sisters, who were of working age, had previously held excellent jobs due to their university education, but as the Middle East became more fundamentalist, they found themselves dismissed from work due to their sex in addition to the overall decline of jobs all around. They were left without any means to support themselves or their families. The story of the country and one family from wealth to poverty, from cosmopolitan cities to village hovels without water was a contrast so great and a poverty so staggering, it helped me understand viscerally what I had read about and intuited before \u2013 poverty is what has fuelled much of the controlling fundamentalism and anti-American sentiments in the Middle East.Al-Kaman spent his childhood, teen and young adult years in Yemen, Lebanon and Egypt and back to Yemen. His experiences give readers a flavour of the Middle East and the changes that have occurred. I already knew that Yemen was more right wing than many other Middle Eastern countries, but the author really brought this home in his memoir and suggested it was in large part due to its close ties with the similarly orthodox country of Saudi Arabia. Intolerable is primarily a personal memoir about coming of age and coming out. As a young boy, Al-Kaman is aware of his attraction to males but keeps it a secret. His culture and environment is so repressed that he has no idea if anyone else like himself even exists. Al-Kaman\u2019s desire to experience 100% of who he is, was so strong, that while in Egypt and Lebanon, he finds opportunities to participate in the gay scene and has his first same sex experience. He finds this experience so liberating that he knows he can no longer stay in Yemen, despite having to leave his entire family. He moves first to England and later to Canada where is now a Canadian citizen, author and professor in the city of Toronto.The book is quite a journey. Al-Kaman\u2019s sharing and development from a young boy to a proud, out there gay man, driven by a strong desire for freedom is at times heartbreaking and at times inspirational. His drive and liberation are admirable. His controlled emotions and at times apparent heartlessness with regards to leaving his family behind, particularly his aging mother, seems rather cold and without compassion but these actions illustrated for me what no words could \u2013 that the yearning to be true to oneself and love oneself is one of the fundamental needs of being human. He did it to survive, to save himself. His memoir helped me understand not just intellectually but in my gut that to be gay isn\u2019t a choice. It\u2019s a fundamental essence from birth. I hope his message reaches many more readers.Al-Kaman\u2019s story is both sad and happy. Happy for him that he came of age, became free and lives in a country he loves. The story of his sisters, the rest of his family and his country is very sad indeed. It taught me a great, deal about the hardships of average Yemenis (particularly women) and how radical the cultural and economic changes have been in such a very short time. With the current regime, the future seems bleak but Al-Kaman sees the bright side in the recent uprisings across the Middle East as sees them signs of hope for a return to freedom for all.I recommend reading Intolerable for a very personal perspective on the Middle East and being gay in a very dominant heterosexual world. It\u2019s a moving, honest, very open and educational memoir."}, {"userName": "Matthew Quann", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann", "userReview": "Continuing to make my way through CANADA READS' 2015 nominees, I found \"Intolerable: A Memoir of Extremes\" to be the least impressive read to date. Kamal Al-Solaylee's memoir details his struggles to come to terms with his homosexuality in Yemen as it coincides with extremist Islam changing his country, family and ultimately leading to his immigration to Canada. While Al-Solaylee's story is undoubtably harrowing and provides a strong tale of an immigrant finding his place in the multicultural quilt of Canada where he is free to express his sexuality, the actual read is a bit of a slog. The majority of the story bounces back between Al-Solaylee's narration of his journey as he comes to terms with the intolerable (SEE WHAT I DID THERE?) conditions in which he has left his family. I found the passages detailing his sisters' progression from being able to exist in a secular country with complete freedom afforded to them to the oppressive and misogynistic Yemen of today to be the most powerful sections, but the rest sort of falls flat. There is an attempt to interweave the historical events in Yemen to Al-Solaylee's personal journey, and they are largely a mixed bag. On occasion his historical account resonates with his personal or familial struggles, at other times it makes you slog through a long and drawn out bit of exposition. Another issue I had with the book was that so little of it focuses on the time Al-Solaylee spends in Canada that it seems as if there are gaps in the story. I wish we had spent more time learning about how he adapts to life in Canada, what changes, what stays the same? What does work really well is the conclusion of the book, which forces Al-Solaylee to come to terms with his freedom while his family lives in a war zone. The idea that this is a living eulogy for the lives his family continue to live is a powerful statement, so it is a shame the rest of the book doesn't operate towards the same goal, meandering from its thesis, taking away from the true punch it should pack. Of all the nominees I have read thus far, this was my least favourite, but due to its subject matter may make for a solid contender.

Finally, imagine moving back to a country where sharia law is practiced... And you are a young gay man. Kamal Al-Solaylee writes about his determination to escape a world in which his sexual orientation could result in his death by hanging. Fleeing first to England and then to Canada, he watches from a distance as his sisters suffer and his father and brothers, previously liberal, become more Conservative.

I thought the amount the author dwelt on his homosexuality was over the top. Obviously, it played into his motivation for leaving and his sense of oppression, but I think he provided more details than necessary. I was put-off by a sense of entitlement he conveyed throughout, giving us details like the fact that he now owns a Cocker Spaniel. In light of the horrors his family is experiencing in Yemen, that women and gays in particular are experiencing (as he does discuss at length), why do we need to know quite SO MUCH about his fascination with Barbra Streisand, Olivia Newton-John and Anne Murray. In conclusion, I think Al-Solaylee had an important and worthwhile story to tell, but the way he went about it was slightly odd and less articulate than I would have expected for someone with his education. Then again (and this is slightly catty), by his own admission he didn't devote the time to his Masters and PhD that they deserved.

I find Al-Solaylee judgmental, opportunistic and self-centred. I know that I'm being harsh. I will be interested to see the debates on Canada Reads. I need to hear some positives about this book.The changes in Yemen and Egypt are huge, but fundamentalist and conservative religion are oppressors too.\"...It will take decades to rebook the economies of countries as different as Egypt and Yemen. It looks unlikely that foreign investment will flow back easily to Egypt, and it may not flow at all to Yemen, which had very little of it to begin with. Millions of unemployed and struggling youth could turn to hardline readings of Islam, leaving them vulnerable to extremists. I worry about the lives of women in a place like Yemen if that happens. How much more marginalized will they be? Despite the odd story in the Western media about how a handful of Yemeni women have taken part in, even spearheaded, the revolution, if the chaos continues the society that will emerge will be tribal, violent and hostile to women.\"Things changed over time, but Kamal's nieces and nephews are different from him. It wasn't in his nature to protest when he was young. He was struggling with his gay identity, and longing for an escape, not to change the country in which he lived; he is self-aware on this one. It would have been way too big a task. But Yousra is admirable.\"My niece Yousra, by then twenty-three, would go behind her mother's back to the protests outside Sana'a University and demand political and economic change. In an email message to me she explained why she insisted on speaking her mind in this way. 'I'm a Yemeni and I have a right.' I couldn't imagine taking part in a revolution or even a demand for change when I was her age. All I'd wanted was to get out. That email highlighted the differences between her generation and her mother's and mine. It's not just that technology has connected the youth of a country like Yemen, there comes a point when a population has just had enough of oppression and despair to say or so something about it.\"I always thought it would be great to have a Star Trek-like cloaking device when I was president/chief steward, especially when I had to choose books for Bookmobile patrons on other floors of the library. Everybody wanted to ask me something about the union, negotiations, or whatever.\"...Still working as a librarian at Sana'a University, she [Raja'a] occasionally got stopped by students in the market if she wasn't wearing the niqab, just for a chat or to ask library-related questions. She said the niqab made her feel more mobile, free to move from one store to the next. I didn't hink that was a good excuse, but wearing it was just camouflage to her. It felt right, she said.\"Al-Solaylee preferred historic analysis, not the psychoanalysis and deconstruction that was becoming popular. And yet it was everywhere. I see it everywhere too. It's interesting that his approach to academia is very anti-academic, and more about changing his culture, and yet he persevered, got his Ph.D and is now a professor. There are many paths through the woods of academia.The importance of names, in culture and in their legacy:\"There's so much to a name in Arabic culture. Your name aligns you socially and politically with your clan or provides an escape from it. ....The verb form of my name, kamael, means to fill the gap or complete a story. To try to live up to the many meanings of Kamal, even subconsciously, is an attempt at self-destruction, one meaning at a time. It's a given that I am far from perfect, but to fill the gap betwen my life now, as a writer and university professor in Toronto, and that of my parents my siblings in Yemen is what makes this book a necessity and a daunting task. How can I write of a mother who lived and died without learning to read or write in her native tongue, let alone English, when I went on to earn a Ph.D. in Victorian literature? Is it still a 'gap' between my mother and me when the distance is the equivalent of living different cetnrues and worlds?...\"Al-Solaylee documents his journey from Yemeni to North America, both geographically and culturally. In the way women began to change their dress:\"...A sister who worked as a librarian at Sana'a University wore the full niqab, covering all her face except her eyes. When I visited again in 2006, she followed me around town for half an hour, just for fun, without revealing her identity to me.

A Janus-like tale in that the reader is invited to see through the eyes of extremely literate, educated Arab male whose sexuality in his country of heritage would judge as blasphemous and subversive, if not criminal. At the same time, the author sketches the life of a culturally-conforming, illiterate matron of incredible strength and resilience. His mother, Safia is a heroine whose story will suffuse beneath the skin of women everywhere whose love of family provides them with great mental strength.Transported through the Arabic peninsula, the Levant, Egypt and Canada, because of family migrations, Kamal describes contrasts and conflicts (internal and external) that most Canadians find unfathomable. The kinds of political, economic and religious upheavals his family endured are not the standard experiences of Canadians. Homosexuality, although still facing obstacles to recognition that makes it simple one of a variety of sexual orientation norms, does not entail the danger that it would in the Middle East. Oppression of women is not eradicated, but certainly is much less blatant or acceptable. The choices women have in Canada are astounding when contrasted with the restrictions found in many other parts of the world. Kamal knows this, but his story reminds us that we need to KNOW this. Kamal\u2019s experience, sexual orientation and education is a fascinating vista to which to view a Middle Eastern upbringing, as he is both an atypical ethnographic informant, as well as interpretive ethnographer.The story of Kamal\u2019s family goes from bad to foreboding to spiritually annihilating. The strong survivor in me is glad for Kamal for \u201cgetting out\u201d of Yemen and the social, political and religious changes that took the family from a form of liberal secularism to a brutal, soul-killing and uncompromising form of religion that likely would have taken Kamal\u2019s life, one way or another. The feminist in me emotionally condemns him for not trying to help his sisters escape a world that would slowly swallow the joy from their lives, although how he could have accomplished this is unknown to me. Sometimes people don\u2019t believe there is a way out of a bad situation even when alternatives are presented let alone when opportunities are exiguous to non-existent.It is a hard story to read and, no doubt, was difficult to write. This is not precisely a triumphant story of immigrant success, even when Kamal realizes that he has found \u201chome\u201d in Toronto. Inasmuch as his life in Canada is fulfilling, his story is heartbreaking because ultimately it is a story of a kind of exhaustion of optimism. Nevertheless, it is a book that I would highly recommend.The best quote of the book for me was: \u201c\u2026it would be another tens years at least before I could sing along to a full Tom Jones record. And to be perfectly honest, I was more interested in the albums because of Jones\u2019s sexy poses on the covers. Glittery tight pantsuits and a sexy swagger. Humperdinck always looked like a dork in comparison.\u201d Thanks to my mother\u2019s love of both singers when I was a very young girl, I could also make the comparison, and I couldn\u2019t agree with him more."}, {"userName": "Sophie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15892569-sophie", "userReview": "I really liked this book and before seeing everyone else's comments, thought it had big chances to win Canada reads. It his memoir and it makes sense that it is written from his perspective. The fact that he rejected for so long his own culture and language is astonishing, and despite the fact that it is sometimes hard to like him, I think his story is very moving. Having to leave one's family behind to be able to live a better life must take a lot of guts and in some ways I admire him. I am not the most knowledgable on the history of the Middle East so some facts names and information were lost on me and I had trouble keeping up,but I was so intrigued by how wearing the hijab and women's rights has evolved in these countries. I did think he could of talked about Canada a bit more. His immigration story was brief and I don't think we got the story of what every immigrant goes through. The contrast between North America and England was interesting, but I thought he praised the U.S. a bit too much. All in all, I thought this book may break barriers as it explains so much on a culture that may not be as known here. I think that especially in Quebec (with the Charte) we might get more insight into the wearing of the hijab and we can understand better. This book covers homosexuality, race and immigration, issues that are very important in Canada , and on all three levels I believe it breaks barriers."}, {"userName": "Bea Seaotter", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29199008-bea-seaotter", "userReview": "This memoir came on my radar as it is one of five books shortlisted for this year's Canada Reads. While I don't think it is \"the one book to break barriers,\" I enjoyed it very much. It was not without fault, hence the thee star rating: it was fairly repetitive, perhaps owning to the fact that there were excerpts from various previously published pieces that possibly overlapped in content (just a guess); and more significantly, the story, though powerful, was told with what I thought was an air of detachment that made connection difficult for me. I can't help but think that this detachment might be Al-Solaylee's way of coping with the intolerable hardships endured by the family he left behind and that he might still be grappling with the related guilt he often spoke about. That, I can understand, but I wonder if the story would have been better told once he'd made peace with his guilt. Merely speculation, of course. I don't regret the time I spent with this book, and would recommend it to anyone who, like me, isn't familiar with Yeman and related politics (beyond the relatively little news coverage we see in Canada), and would like to expand their world view via a short and fascinating personal account from someone who lived there during a very dynamic time."}, {"userName": "Carla Johnson-Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17074498-carla-johnson-hicks", "userReview": "I read this book as part of the Canada Reads Book of the month. We are reading the Canada Reads books. I was quite glad I picked this one up.Kamal Al-Solaylee was the youngest of 11 children born to Yemeni parents. His father was a business man who was involved in real estate in Aden, Yemen. When the socialists took over, they lost all their property and were driven out. They ended up in Beruit, followed by Egypt. The family moved as racial tensions rose and unemployment for his siblings occurred. They finally ended up back in Northern Yemin in Sanaa'a. The story tells of the hardships and poverty the family and other Yemenis endured. Kamal, as a gay man, was also in fear all the time. His brothers began to embrace Islam and the freedom the family had in the past as a non-secular family was erased. Kamal eventually emigrated to Canada, where he wrote this book to connect with his roots, his family and to move forward in his life. Very touching and educating."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5926546-sharon", "userReview": "I did think this book made some powerful statements about the changing climate in the Middle-East over the course of five or six decades, the intensification and rise of the strictest interpretations of Islam, one young man's growing realization of his homosexuality and his place in those societies, and the changing realities for women over the years. His own family's situation was heart-breaking and I would have liked more writing about that, but as he has spent a few decades living in Toronto in a kind of estrangement from them, with brief uncomfortable phone calls, perhaps no more can be expected. All-in-all, I didn't find this book riveting, but the subject matter was definitely interesting. What I most appreciated was the author's unswerving honesty about his gayness, his discomfort in his homeland and his feelings of guilt and compassion toward his family. I felt that I was almost inside the head of a youth coming to understand his sexuality."}, {"userName": "Hella Comat", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5904251-hella-comat", "userReview": "Memoir of a Toronto professor of journalism who grew up in Yemen. His family was not religious and his father was in real estate. In the 60s, revolutionaries took over, confiscated all of the family's properties, and they moved first to Beirut and later to Cairo. There the wave of Islamic extremism in the early 80s sent them back to Yemen, where their quality of life quickly went downhill as Middle East unrest grew. His 10 older siblings were affected by the Arab/Muslim influence: the once-liberal brothers became proponents of Islam and bullied the sisters into changing their way of life, dress, culture, and religion. Kamal left to go to school in England and later in the US and Canada as he wanted to live an openly gay life.

He is an excellent writer with a really unique and soft, real voice. We don't blame him, we just feel for him and he identifies with the struggles of being a gay man, who immigrated to Canada, but at the same time, not really know how he got there, and not be too sure how to feel about the family that he left behind.

I ordered it from the library and had no idea what to expect. I found it to be quite an interesting and quick read. Kamal shares his life story moving from a secure middle east to our current middle east. It was fascinating to read how life seemed to 'move backwards' especially for the women in terms of, what westerners would consider, freedom. Equally as interesting, was his story from the eyes of being a gay male in the middle east and eventually in Toronto. For someone like me who has little knowledge of the middle east crisis except from a Western News perspective, I quite enjoyed reading a first hand account."}, {"userName": "Sherry Monger", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5548515-sherry-monger", "userReview": "I found this to be an interesting memoir in light of the fighting that is going on in Yemen at the present time.

The family moved first to Beirut, which suddenly became one of the most dangerous places in the world, then Cairo. After a few peaceful years, even the safe haven of Cairo struggled under a new wave of Islamic extremism that culminated with the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981. The family returned to Yemen, a country that was then culturally isolated from the rest of the world.As a gay man living in an intolerant country, Al-Solaylee escaped first to England and eventually to Canada, where he became a prominent journalist and academic. While he was enjoying the cultural and personal freedoms of life in the West, his once-liberal family slowly fell into the hard-line interpretations of Islam that were sweeping large parts of the Arab-Muslim world in the 1980s and 1990s. The differences between his life and theirs were brought into sharp relief by the 2011 revolution in Egypt and the civil war in Yemen.Intolerable is part memoir of an Arab family caught in the turmoil of Middle Eastern politics over six decades, part personal coming-out narrative and part cultural analysis.
