This book was much better than I had anticipated it to be which was a very pleasant, if UNEXPECTED, SURPRISE. \nI thought this was going to be a decent, but somewhat cheesy Urban Fantasy knock-off of the Dresden Files. While certainly these two series share many basic themes (as most UF does), this was a TERRIFIC READ. In fact, in two very important respects I thought this book was actually SUPERIOR to the Dresden books. Given that the Dresden books are the current \u201cstandard\u201d at least for male UF, I am going to provide a little insight into my feelings about that series so that you will better understand my comment about this book\u2019s superiority. HARRY DRESDEN THOUGHTSFor the most part, I am fan of the Harry Dresden BOOKS because I think that the world that Jim Butcher has created is really something special in the realm of Urban Fantasy and that the plots are well developed and engaging....HOWEVER, I have ONE BIG PROBLEM with the Dresden books and that, unfortunately, is good old Harry Dresden himself. I have two main problems with Harry. The first is his \u201cOVER...THE...TOP...I\u2019ll-be-a-martyr....oh....whoa...is....me....I may be a hero, BUT don\u2019t you ever call me one\u201d attitude. That may be my longest \u201c__\u201d as adjective description ever. Those of you who have read the books will hopefully understand what I am saying. A second, and probably more annoying problem I have with Dresden is the constant torrent of lame jokes and dialogue. To demonstrate, I would like to submit the following into evidence for consideration while holding back the bile forming in my throat:EXHIBIT 1\n .....That sounds like the POT getting into a seriously ironic conversation with the KETTLE about color schemes. EXHIBIT 2\n .....PLEASE, PLEASE BE A SHOTGUN!!! EXHIBIT 3\n ...THAT DOES IT.....\nEND HARRY DRESDEN THOUGHTSSo given my feelings for Harry and his \u201csense of humor\u201d I was very happy to come across Felix Castor in this story. Felix is a freelance exorcist who you can basically think of as a British \u201cghostbuster.\u201d I thought he was a very well drawn character with a dry, British sense of humor which I found very funny. He is a good guy, but with a touch more grey then your typical protagonist which again I really liked. Felix lives in an alternate \u201cLondon\u201d where around the year 2000, an-as-yet-unexplained phenomenon caused all manner of ghosts (and some rather nastier creatures as well) to begin walking the streets of London. That may sound cheesy or hokey and if so it is my fault because the way the world was introduced (to me at least) was believable and I was instantly sucked into it. As for the writing, I thought it was much better than I had expected and had a real crisp, polish to it that came across especially well with Felix\u2019s dry, sarcastic dialogue. The plot is fairly conventional (as you can imagine for a first book) but also sufficiently complex to keep your interest and there are some excellent supporting characters. All and all, I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading the next book in the series.

Shades of horror and dark urban fantasy blended into a noir mystery that kept me guessing until the end. I love when a writer is able to pull all the elements together that he introduces to me, from beginning to end. And that's what Mike Carey does here. Tight plotting and subtle characterization. Even the characters that would seem stereotypical have depth and intensity.Felix Castor gets added to my roster of male lead urban fantasy go-to characters. He is a cynical, flawed, morally unpredictable man who somehow shows a deep sense of right and wrong, even if his means don't exactly scream \"Boy Scout.\" When he could have just walked away several times, or taken the easy road, saving his own skin and putting money in his pockets, he digs deeper, compelled to do the right, although not easy thing. That's what I like in a protagonist. Flawed, questionable, but in the end, someone I can root for.The world-building and esoterical aspects of this story are distinctive and not at all easy to pin down. Here we have an self-declared atheist, who sees and exorcises ghosts and has had some very uneasy experiences with demons. I don't really see Castor so much as an atheist, but more of a hard-hearted agnostic. How could he not credit the existence of God and the devil if he sees it right in front of him? It's not a matter of belief when it's staring you in the face. Instead, he merely chooses not to look deeply into those aspects of the world he is confronted with, much like a stubborn person who refuses to look at the person who is in authority over him. Just my take, really. Ghosts fascinate me. This book delves into the whys and wherefore of hauntings, asking the reader to ponder, even if Castor refuses to do so. He merely deals with them, sending them wherever they are supposed to go from this plane of existence in which they linger as melancholy shadows. Carey doesn't force the reader to draw conclusions, but leaves it up to those who care enough to come to their own understanding. This book fits into my view of hauntings at any rate, although I have my own opinions about what comes next, even as I question what forces keep a spirit here on this plane.Zombies and werebeasts also have a presence in Castor's world of London. I never thought of weres the way that Carey explains them, and I appreciate the novel elements here. Zombies are merely reanimated bodies inhibited by spirits. In fact, Nick, one of Castor's contacts is a reanimated corpse who has a serious case of conspiracy theoriaisis. Which makes him good, very good at finding out information. Clearly zombies (although not called by that name) exist, but they are just another aspect that Carey doesn't explain to death. He merely puts this oddness out there in a real world context, and lets the reader do what they like with the information. This is a dark read. Surprisingly the supernatural elements aren't what lends the darkest flavor. It's the glimpse at very human evil at the depths that made me shudder as I read. And I think Castor and I are in the same boat on that. I really want to give this fire stars. I can't say that there was anything lacking in the execution. Carey is a very good writer. For a 500 page novel, my attention didn't wander, and I was drawn fully into this world. His characterization is very good, he sets atmosphere with a deft, expert hand, and he imparts a sophisticated flavor to this noir urban fantasy that I found very seductive. There were more than a few words that I didn't know, and wanted to look up, but I was too busy reading to be bothered, and I was able to figure out through context. He clearly appreciates London in all his flavors, and I appreciated the opportunity to pay this ancient city a visit, even though there was a dark, gritty cast to this venerable metropolis, which is altogether real, I have no doubt.I was very impressed with this novel. It captures what I like very well in my urban fantasy. The dark and gritty, the wry humor, the intriguing supernatural elements, and in a way that doesn't make me cry same old same. Definitely one for this reader's keeper shelf, and a series that I will happily follow."}, {"userName": "Carol.

I'm rounding up in Carey's case, because I think his hero is suffering from comparison to Carey's own Constantine, and Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden. I too thought of Harry Dresden while I was reading, but I found Felix Castor to be more likeable, and the overall story more enjoyable. It is clearly a \"first book in a series,\" meaning that there is a great deal of world building. I felt it was worthwhile, and not excessive to me, but I enjoy a well-thought out world and the investment is worth it as I plan to continue with the series. The worldview itself isn't that unusual, but it's set up nicely, so that we are gentle immersed in it, feeling it build around us. I prefer that over the \"throw you in the deep end and let you figure it out\" mentality. London geography has me lost, but I don't mind.Felix is a thoughtful hero, and I appreciate his ability to reflect on his values and perhaps even change. His self-reflection lacks the self-indulgent, whining, \"why-me?\" tone that some heroes have (I'm talking to you, Harry Dresden). Humor is present in daily interactions, but it is not so ever present that storyline and character are sacrificed for the witty response.An interesting comparison to Dresden that no one seems to mention is that there is really very little supernatural politics to date. The plot is along the lines of a \"resolve the mystery and figure out how the pieces fit together\" with a fair amount of action keeping the pace going. However, Castor doesn't take beating after beating until he's so battered you wonder how he is still standing (Harry? You again), which helps sustain a more believable pace."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "There's something about all detective novels that provide a very nice pace for the prospective reader, a gentle lulling between beatings and the solving of murders, and this is only enhanced by the inclusion of ghosts and Succubi. I only learned later into the reading of this that he's the author of other Constantine stories, so my initial connection made perfect sense. Hell, I like Constantine, so this is pretty much perfect for me.I know I'm going to like the rest of the series, if this is a good sample.

VERY HAPPY I DID! Felix Castor is an exorcist in an alt-London, attitude-y and very enjoyable. This is a non-romance-type paranormal, so it was a nice break from my usual, and I really loved the mystery aspect of the book, it was well done. In addition, it kinda creeped me out, so I had to check the closet twice before bed-time. Ghosts can be creepy even in print!Jim Butcher fans will like this series.

Also, it's one of those books where the main character does a lot of thinking and explaining to the audience and I'm left wondering what the other characters are doing when he's taking 10 minutes to explain demons or whatever. Playing All Hail the Queen [*headdesk*] God Save the Queen with their armpit? Making a trip to Burger King? Summoning their own demon?However, it was quite nice to a have a different type of Rosa (a character in the book).

I can't say that. There is a huge difference in this character, the world he functions in and the overall \"feel\" of the book. When I say the world is different I'm sure some thought (or said aloud) well of course the world's different, did you expect it to take place in the same world?No. My meaning there was that the world is a much darker more negative place. \"Fix\" is a far more nihilistic guy than Harry will ever be and the book feels far more \"chill\" to me in it's over all point of view.Now, taking the book on it's own terms, the writing is done well and it's readable. The more comfortable you are with English idiom, probably the better, but that can be said about American idiom in many other books, Australian, in others and so on. Fix (Felix) is an exorcist, but don't think ministers, priests, prayers, or anything church related. Fix had a hard childhood (what urban fantasy protagonist didn't?) and is \"scarred\" (what urban fantasy protagonist isn't?). He has a gift that makes him \"sensitive\" to the presence of Ghosts....and other creepy critters. He can feel them if they're around and see them (some people can't actually see ghosts). You see something has happened and dead things are suddenly \"very common\" and there is really no longer any question that ghosts and \"other things\" exist. These other things include zombies, demons, \"weres\" ,all of which are called loup garou (french basically for wolf/man who changes into animal) no matter what animal they are. In this world a \"were\" is an animal possessed by a ghost of a human....Fix had a bad experience that introduced him to his \"gift\" when he was young and then later, as a young man had another that caused him to \"swear off\" his exorcist gig. Of course that can't stick or we wouldn't have a book.The novel has a few subtexts and we see Fix all the way through mentally chewing over the after life, what may be going on with all the dead and undead and...big question....where do these ghosts etc. go when he exorcises them?Not a bad book. I was torn on my rating, I am settling on a 3 though it may be closer to a 2.5. A couple of times I put the book down and almost wrote it off, but finally went back to it and finished. I think at this point I may try one more, but it's not like I don't have a lot to read. If the next doesn't hit me any better I probably won't pursue the series any further.(Oops. Did an update. Looked back and found several typos...)"}, {"userName": "Erin \u2615 *Proud Book Hoarder*", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3048260-erin-proud-book-hoarder", "userReview": "\u201cYou move on. You move back. On because you're always getting older, back because there's always a set of habits and routines to catch you and suck you back in when your guard is down.\u201d I loved Mike Carey's writing style, it's sublime - colorful, poetic flow, funny when it's supposed to be, dramatic when it's supposed to be. Not all of the British terminology is familiar, but I adore the British writing tone as long as it's not bone dry. And hey, learn something new every day?The protagonist Felix is a likeable guy - his outlook works, his humors fun, he's a good sort. He has the unique ability to see ghosts and try to help them cross over to an unknown side he avoids thinking about or even believing in half the time. The woman he's staying with is a likeable mystery. Scary villains are scary. And his friend in the mental asylum was uber disturbing. That succubus though...The plot was interesting and just that touch of different that makes it stand out from other UF. Felix is a down-on-his-luck sort of guy who gets hired, against his better judgement, to take on a job that he shouldn't have taken on. From there things fall down the lego effect hole and bad goes to worse and then worse still.So why a 3 star rating? For some reason I just couldn't get into the story much, it wouldn't grab my attention. There's some lagging here and there so perhaps a trimming of book length would help. Fans of male leads in Urban Fantasy series should try this one and see how they like it. Overall a dark, gritty Urban Fantasy with a strong mystery, an enjoyable voice via the main character, and creepy touches with demon and ghost appearances.

So when I heard he was working on a series of novels, I was eager to see what he could do with a world of his own creation. Sadly, the answer turned out to be\u2026not very much.The premise of following the exploits of an exorcist-for-hire sounds promising, but Carey just doesn\u2019t do enough with it. Overall, the story just plods along and takes way too long to get anywhere. Felix Castor is a likeable-enough protagonist, and some of his dialogue was witty, but most of the people and creatures he encounters are dull and one-dimensional. The first 150 pages or so spend way too much time detailing Felix\u2019s search for a ghost that doesn\u2019t have enough presence to be interesting. Later, a new adversary is introduced, but again, the demon isn\u2019t overly exciting or compelling, and I found it hard to care about what was going on. The book does have some good moments, but nearly enough of them.I think what really hurt this novel was that Mike Carey was writing in a new format and was over-compensating. Carey is used to writing for 22-page comic books, so he\u2019s forced to get to the point. Here, since he has more space, he made the mistake of describing even the most mundane things in excruciating detail, and it ruins the pacing of the novel.

(I am not impressed by this review form but as this is my first review I should probably curb my disdain a bit.) Very well then. What I Learned from This Book: I learned that I very much enjoy books about ghosts and other supernatural creatures that have infested our modern world. I learned that I especially like books of this nature when they are narrated by sardonic and somewhat seedy male narrators who make their livings performing exorcisms. I learned that sometimes those exorcisms go wrong. And sometimes a job that should be a piece of cake turns out to be a much darker business than anyone anticipated. I also learned that succubi, as written by Mike Carey, are pretty damned intimidating creatures. I did not learn that the library (well, the archive but close enough) is a hotbed of hidden secrets, ulterior motives, and questionable co-workers. I already knew that. And finally I learned that Mike Carey writes a fast-moving, well-plotted, and well-written novel with more literary references that I was anticipating because I am a snob.

This book wasn't necessarily bad but it was 1. entirely too long and 2. fairly uninspired. I feel like coming from comics into novels Carey overcompensated a bit and included a lot of random details / inner monologue that wasn't really necessary to the story because this book just dragged on and on for me. It picked up towards the end but the ending also had its own problems for me personally [see below]. And there's nothing really special about Felix, he's just like Standard Magical Detective Dude #18390. The whole thing just felt like a value-brand Hellblazer to me and once you consider that Carey published this almost immediately after working on Hellblazer it's just like ??? really??? I've heard it gets better so I might try the second book, but probably somewhere very far down the road as I have already discovered that reading this and Hellblazer at the same time is no good.Also POSSIBLE TW / DEFINITE SPOILERS, the entire ghost-murder-mystery thing is a case of human trafficking / sex slavery and while I wouldn't necessarily say it was handled poorly, it's definitely something that I try to avoid reading whenever possible and had I known I probably wouldn't have even started the book in the first place.

In his altered world, in which the dead have risen and now pace the streets as zombies and ghosts, Felix's skills as an exorcist are at a premium. After a terrible accident in which he helped to bind a friend's soul to a demon, Felix is trying to take early retirement from the ghostbuster business. With money tight and fear on the rise, it's just not that easy for Felix to hang up his exorcism flute. To earn a bit of much-needed cash, he takes on one last exorcism. It seems simple--a ghost in a museum who has suddenly taken to violence--but as always seems to be the case, things are never as simple as they appear. Far too soon, Felix is drawn into a web of conspiracy and brutality, with a mob boss expressing a rather sinister interest in him, a demon ready to hunt him down, and a loup-garou after his blood. Worse still, Felix is forced to question his own beliefs about life, death, and the supernatural.The Devil You Know is a compelling read, a hardboiled detective story transposed into a gritty apocalyptic world. Castor is an engaging narrator and his wry, humorous voice is effective and appealing. Take his explanation for how he got into ghostbusting:\"But how many people do you know who actually get to choose what they do for a living? My careers teacher said I should go into hotel management, so exorcism it was.\"As one might expect from the title, The Devil You Know is a very dark read, without as much of the genre-savvy absurdism that tends to characterize urban fantasy. There is humour, most of it decidedly British and involving references to Thatcher and Blue Peter, but at least in my first read, I was not once tempted to laugh out loud. However, this speaks more about the underlying darkness of the plot and Carey's ability to generate suspense. On my second read, I found quite a few passages hilarious. I especially love Castor's mixed metaphors such as:\"It wasn\u2019t what I was expecting, but like I\u2019ve always said, if life gives you lemmings, jump off a cliff.\" Most urban fantasy pits the protagonist against supernatural evils, but this book is about man's inhumanity to man, leading to a much darker, more upsetting, and more introspective book. It also calls into question many of the basic assumptions of most urban fantasy worlds. For example, in most urban fantasy novels, because most of the villains faced in urban fantasy are nonhuman, removing them becomes a righteous act. It is taken for granted that vampires don't have souls so a stake through the heart isn't murder, that since souls are just residual carbon copies, a salt-and-burn operation at a graveside is just a guilt-free janitorial exercise, that the creature being hunted is a monster and removing a monster is a moral act. But in Felix Castor's case, the greatest monsters are the other people. Even loup-garou are people in some ways, since they are ghosts possessing animal bodies, and it is the human intelligence that makes them vicious. What happens to an exorcised ghost is unknown. Is he damning the souls of those dead, or releasing them to a better hereafter? That open question makes the tone of the novel very gritty and saturnine, but also creates a complex and compelling world.The overall feel of the novel is very noir hardboiled detective; we have the standard mob boss and femme fatale plot arcs and quite a reasonable mystery. At the same time, the perpetrator becomes pretty obvious about halfway through, and waiting for the naive Felix to catch up is frustrating. In Castor's world, it is humanity, not supernatural monsters, who are the root of all evil, leading to a plot that at times feels unrelentingly dark. Mike Carey also goes out of his way to castigate the Church as rigid and hypocritical. I'm no longer Christian--I misplaced my faith and it hasn't yet turned up in the lost and found--but even I was appalled at the vitriol applied to the religion. Castor has the jaded world-weariness of a true hardboiled detective, but unlike \"protagonists\" such as Richard Kadrey's James Stark, he has not caved into self-serving nihilism. Felix still believes in right and wrong and wants to do the right thing with an almost painful intensity. What makes this book such a dark and compelling read is that it is simply not always easy to figure out, in a complex and twisted world, exactly what constitutes the moral act.Overall, The Devil You Know combines some of the best aspects of urban fantasy with the mood and structure of classic noir. Castor is an appealing narrator, a satisfyingly imperfect protagonist in a world of gritty greys. The book is an intriguing start to a great series. The Felix Castor books only get better from here.Excerpted from \nmy review on Booklikes."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah", "userReview": "It's extremely tempting to give this book five stars simply because this is easily one of my favorite series of all time.

The best part were the moral questions he has to grapple with Ina not very cut and dried way. The greatest thing, though, is that I learned several new words while reading this book and many more than I only know in context and couldn't necessarily define. A couple weren't even in my two dictionary apps on my phone. It has been years since I have read a fiction book with one word I didn't know. (The exception is really specific jargon for a subject gone into great depth like the word for the tool you use to grab the genitals of an obscure amphibian to determine its gender. This is how I sometimes learn new word in nonfiction like medical terminology etc.) But finding a word used as if it were an everyday word makes me feel like I'm studying for the SATs or something. Only a couple of times were they Beitish slang. Generally the words worked and it didn't feel awkward. Many of the references were foreign to me but usually that was because they were related to British culture and events. He overused metaphors and similes in the beginning.

I was excited about where this story line was going to take me, but the writing style got in the way.I found the flow of the narrative uneven, and there were some turns of phrase that lost me on occasion, forcing me to re-read the context of it. Not a free flowing reading experience for me, so I\u2019m cutting it loose.And the noir thing? I find in this context it took away from what could have been a spookier read.Too bad.

Instead of wanting to get rid of the pesky hooded lady in white he realizes that something fishy is going on in the seemingly civilized and proper world of art and treasures and some people have crossed moral lines resulting in a haunting. Felix has other things to worry about, a big guy named Scrub who forces him to take on other projects, a mysterious succubus summoned from hell to get rid of him - someone doesn't want him to solve the enigma - and a brothel pimp who wants him to work on his side. Suffocated by negative sources he must solve the mystery of the mute ghost while under the watchful eyes of Alice, the lady in charge who seems to run the Archive while sleeping with the boss.I liked the set up; the archives - quite an interesting place since I love libraries and various other paper storage places. It echoed of slight creepiness at night when Felix would sneak in to do his work, while seemingly alone he bumped into some things that kept threatening his life. This book was a fun read, although not too deep it still kept me interested enough to finish it in record time and the ending has quite interesting, I didn't make the connections until they were shown to me, so that's good, surprises are always welcome in my world of reading. I also liked that it left some threads running, I can only conclude that this story line will continue but with different clues and a new crime."}, {"userName": "Lightreads", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads", "userReview": "Urban fantasy, same general map references as The Dresden Files -- loner magical protagonist with a tragical past, a supernatural mystery, that sort of thing.

But now he's at a financial dead-end and he ends up taking a job to exorcize a ghost from a document archive. But nothing is simple about this job, and he receives a warning that the job will be the end of him.Through most of the first half of this I just wanted the story to get on with it.

Not that there weren't differences, 'cause there are, but I felt the influence was obvious, at the least - in some of the humor, the whole guilt about past mistakes with magic hurting friends, that sort of thing.But while Constantine is a more all-purpose magician, Fix is more just an exorcist. Well, a retired one, until he's forced to take a job to pay the bills.At first it seems a straight forward job, but then things start going pear shaped. Thing is, I felt it took a bit too long to go pear shaped. A lot of time was spent in set up, things - well, some things - getting explained in tedious detail, whereas things like why the dead suddenly started coming back a few years back are just stated as fact and left at that. But, then, I guess no one knows.Anyway - while I liked Fix, overall, and the dark humor of the thing, there was something about the rest of the prose, in general, which just didn't quite do it for me. Maybe it was just the slow pacing. Maybe it was because I didn't feel there was really a lot at stake until about half-way through, and, even then, I connected with the ghost a lot more than I did any of the living characters.The story was pretty much a straight whodunit, but in a world with ghosts, succubi, and were-things. I guessed the bad guy before the reveal, and felt a step ahead of Fix on a few things. Not that there weren't a few interesting twists - especially at the end/epilogue - and I have to say that little tidbit, more than anything else, has me interested in following up with the second in the series some day."}, {"userName": "Dean", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5678726-dean", "userReview": "This book came up as a suggestion after I read the first two installments of the \"Sandman Slim\" series by Richard Kadrey.I am SO glad I did.My pat line is that I do not go too far into plot as that is better left to jacket covers.I used to read \"Hellblazer\" religiously (pun intended) so I was most definitely intrigued by Mike Carey's writing in Novel form.Herein Constantine is reborn with a tin whistle as Felix Castor or \"Fix.\" Exorcist and scamp extraordinaire. This is definitely a pulp noir detective novel, but really so much more.The book was incredibly well-written and calls to the Queen's English to convey the tale. The tone is perfect. The descriptions are lush and glorious. I have read some people saying that they feel Carey is \"too descriptive.\" I would disagree.I love that I could feel every place that he took me, smell every person I met and could really hear their voices.The characters are very well-fleshed out and the story is evocative.Our protagonist is so well-drawn that I feel as if I know him personally and this makes for a fantastic read as I was truly invested from beginning to end.There are parts that might be hard to read for some as Carey goes for some very dark material here. This is to be expected in terms of dealing in a trade that plays to the \"soul\" as it were, but note-it can get very dark.While I felt content with the end I question some of the happenings that took place literally in the final pages. I look forward to seeing what is done with those twists. I will be reading the next four books after this and any that come after those!This series is one that I hope goes on for a long time.Namaste~"}, {"userName": "Jamie Collins", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins", "userReview": "3.5 stars, a good read.Felix Castor sees dead people. Actually, in this world everyone sees dead people but only a talented few can make them go away - which is how Castor used to earn his living, as an exorcist, before a tragic mistake made him question his calling. He takes the job back on due to financial pressures, of course, and tries to solve the mystery of a haunted documentation archive.The adventure, which takes place in an alternate modern-day London, is populated with ghosts, demons, loup-garous and a succubus, as well as ordinary crime bosses, prostitutes, librarians and thieves. Be prepared for a fair amount of British slang and references.I enjoyed the book, and I've already ordered the next one. I'd recommend it to those who like The Dresden Files series since this feels a little bit like Harry Dresden in London, only darker and with less snark. I liked the writing very much. The plot was nothing special but the author has a knack for storytelling, notwithstanding a long passage towards the end where the bad guy confesses at length.

Mike Carey is a talented writer, capable of nicely turning out a phrase or fleshing out a character or creating suspense. I'd be very interested to read some original fiction from him that doesn't pertain to Felix Castor, but as is I plan to read the other Castor novels at some point.

While trying to back out of this ill-conceived career, Castor accepts a seemingly simple ghost-hunting case at a museum in the shadowy heart of London--just to pay the bills, you understand.
