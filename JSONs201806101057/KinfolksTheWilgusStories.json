This book is considered a classic of Appalachian Literature. The book at first appears as very simplistic but I found that the stories progress in complexity. Norman captures the gamut of human emotion and human experience. This is a short, quick read for those who enjoy Appalachian literature."}, {"userName": "M.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9075047-m", "userReview": "A collection of 10 stories, all involving Wilgus Collier at various stages of his life. These stories are short and interesting, supremely easy to read and highly engaging. Gurney Norman feels like a more honest Wendell Berry, an author who writes endearingly about rural Kentucky living, but one who is unflinching in exposing the cyclical hardships and evils at the center of human relationships. Wilgus himself becomes the real miracle, the constant force for good who is empathetic toward and proactive in the lives of all those many varied family members he has spent his life learning to love and to cope with."}, {"userName": "Dan Eggleston", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8052524-dan-eggleston", "userReview": "wonderful book. read it after seeing a film of some of the stories & the film is equally wonderful. see it at https://vimeo.com/24307259"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5900824-amy", "userReview": "This book was recommended to me so I read it to be nice. The book was not what I thought it would be. I thought it would be more of a timeline story about a boy growing up in the Appalachians. If I had knows it was a bunch of short stories peiced together because the main character was somehow in each story I don't know if I would have read it. It was a quick read, and some of it was kind of fun and because of my large family being from a small community I could relate to some of it. This is not the type of book I generally pick out myself and if I was left to I would not have picked it out at all. The recommendation was nice and I am always up for new authors and such but I don't hink this one will make it to my favorites list."}, {"userName": "Peter Wentworth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/978939-peter-wentworth", "userReview": "his collection of short stories that follows the life of Wilgus Collier from childhood up until his mid 30's or so is one of the great short story collections in American Fiction.The writing is spare and elegant, with a robustness and compassion for growing up in rural America in the early 1950's that is only rivaled by The Last Picture Show, and Stephen King's novella, The Body.It's hard to find but worth the hunt - and its long long overdue to be included in the Canon of American fiction, and southern fiction."}, {"userName": "Dennis Fischman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1342011-dennis-fischman", "userReview": "Did you ever read a book that was so apparently simple you raced through it and then said, \"I have to read that again\"? That was my reaction to Kinfolks. Each story is complete on the surface, but it has hidden depths of character, conflict, and history. By following a boy to manhood in his Appalachian family, Gurney Norman says more about the culture of the area and the devastation that coal mining (and the collapse of the industry) have left behind than all the nonfiction books I have read about this region so far. And the stories are gems of fiction."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Burchett", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14653345-jennifer-burchett", "userReview": "Oh Gurney. You leave me wanting more! I started this collection about a month ago, and I wanted to start at the beginning again after seeing the short film Fat Monroe. It's a quick read, and I finished it in one sitting. The stories and characters are so rich, and there is not a wasted word in it. It makes me regret not taking a tape recorder on my visits to Cow Creek and Abbot Creek when I visited my grandparents. Stroke of genius!"}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8248634-janet", "userReview": "I loved this book. Kinfolks is a short story cycle. Each tale is a clip of time in the life of Wilgus from childhood to adulthood. He is part of a poor coal mining family living in eastern Kentucky. We get a realistic look back at Kentuckians from the 1950- 1970\u2019s who were poor, uneducated and lived back in the hollows. As depicted in, \"Kinfolks,\" many were loud, crude and harsh, and included alot of dialect when speaking. Wilgus's family fought and feuded, but they also had a strong bond."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1884336-barbara", "userReview": "I see from the inscription in this book that it has been sitting on my shelves since 1979. Not even sure how it got there in the first place since I don't much care for the short story genre but likely acquired it due to my fondness for Divine Right's Trip. Now I realize that I know these people. They are Kentuckians, Appalachian, friends, neighbors, and acquaintances. Their voices are familiar and dear and unsentimentalized. Just excellent."}, {"userName": "Introvertigo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30114496-introvertigo", "userReview": "Didn't love it, but didn't hate it. It was relatable, and inclusive for Appalachians or really anywhere in the world. Everywhere has some poverty, everyone has some crazy relatives and I'm sure we all know a little about dysfunctional family. It was a quick easy read. Got a little worried at the end, but ended up liking the book overall."}, {"userName": "Carolyn Tassie", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7672231-carolyn-tassie", "userReview": "Not a usual short story reader, I loved this collection of short stories.
