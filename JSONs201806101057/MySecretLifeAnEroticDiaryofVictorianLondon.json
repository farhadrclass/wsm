{"ratings": 468, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt", "userReview": "Don\u2019t judge me.I have a very good reason for reading this excessively graphic, insistently perverse, Victorian-era sex memoir. I\u2019m researching, you see, for this, ah, for this book I\u2019m writing about mid-19th century London scullery maids. Or something. Let us be honest with each other. We all know why I read Anonymous\u2019 My Secret Life. The reason is simple. Because it\u2019s there. I am the Mallory of prurient interest and this is my Everest. I can still sense you judging me. Alas, this is who I am. I read a lot of books. Books on the Civil War. On World War I and II. Biographies about presidents. Biographies about generals. But every once in awhile, I feel the need to read something bawdy. And so we arrive at this place. My wife took it rather well. The look on her face when I added this to my bookshelf was pretty amazing. I didn't know a person could have so many conflicted feelings reflected on their face simultaneously. To her credit, she didn't say a thing. Just pulled out the ol\u2019 pre-printed divorce forms and made a few updates. Eventually, she also came up with a list of ground rules for reading My Secret Life. To wit: I was not allowed to read it in public, including the patio, where people might see. I wasn\u2019t allowed to bring it to work, lest I lose my job. I couldn\u2019t read it in our bedroom, or in my office, or in the kids\u2019 rooms, or in any room the kids ever entered, or in the kitchen where food was prepared. I also couldn\u2019t read it in the bathroom unless I was simultaneously taking an ice-cold shower. Or alone. Or in the presence of our children. I was not allowed to read this while sitting or laying down. I finished this standing in our front hall. The last thing you need \u2013 or want \u2013 is a sex lecture from me. But I think we can all agree on a natural law: that people have always engaged in sexual activity. And they\u2019ve liked it. For long stretches of human history, this reality has been cleverly hidden by various scolds and inquisitors. Yet it has always been there. From pornographic cave art and the Kama Sutra to the whalebone dildos of Nantucket housewives and patent-machines sold to alleviate a woman\u2019s \u201chysteria\u201d, there has always been a sexually charged undercurrent to life on Earth. In the history of sex, the Victorian Era has always been held up as a time of high moral dudgeon, a subdued period of restrained language, conservative dress, and oh-so-proper behavior. This is a generality, of course, and generalities are always wrong in the specifics, which My Secret Life aptly proves. This book originally came from an eleven volume opus totaling 4,000 or so pages. It is important to note \u2013 so that you don\u2019t get a LifeLock alert every time I enter your neighborhood \u2013 that I did not read anywhere near 4,000 pages. My Secret Life is firmly in the public domain, meaning that there are a lot of versions to read. Through Kindle, you can even get the whole eleven volumes (though I will definitely form an unfavorable mental picture of you if you do). The print version I read was slapped together by some internet publisher and put onto 324 pages, sized 11x8.5. The editing is horrible. The grammar and spelling errors rampant. It is impossible for me to know whether this is the fault of Anonymous (you can go to Wikipedia to read the debate as to the author\u2019s true identity \u2013 I\u2019m in no position to say whether this is a good use of your time or not), or the fault of the \u201cpublisher.\u201d It is also, therefore, impossible for me to know what was excised. The version I read answers a philosophical question I have long pondered: Why do pornographic films bother with plots. The answer, surprisingly, is that sex can get boring. (Somewhere on the space-time continuum, my fourteen-year-old self is shaking his head in disbelief). You need some sort of moral context for sexual activity, or else it becomes this primitive mechanical act that is initially attention grabbing but eventually meaningless. This fundamental truth has long been known to smut purveyors, which is why there are so many libidinous aliens and horny copy machine repairmen floating through XXX movies. For the most part, my edition of My Secret Life is nothing more than a list of graphically described sexual conquests. At first, I was okay with this. The author, whoever he is, is a provocateur, and he certainly got my attention. It takes a lot to shock me, and he succeeded. At the start of this memoir, you find the author hidden beneath the privy, staring up at women who are going to the bathroom. Disgusted already? He\u2019s just warming up. You will follow him as he purchases prostitute after prostitute, often using his last farthing. You will read about every farmer\u2019s daughter and scullery maid he ever seduced. Every conquest of his life is told in rather graphic detail utilizing his own very unique lexicon of euphemisms. One of the indicators that this might be a true account, rather than an epic of Victorian erotica, is that the narrator never attempts to place himself in a positive light. This is not an irresistible specimen of manhood having his way with an endless procession of beautiful damsels. Quite the contrary, most of his action is purchased, and since he is often nearly broke, there is a lot of begging involved. (Also, since he does not like to use French letters, he gets the clap). You have to read this stuff to believe it. Take this excerpt, for instance: [EXPLICIT CONTENT DELETED]Or this section: [EXPLICIT CONTENT DELETED](It turns out there is not a single thing that is suitable to quote). Eventually, shock gives way to tedium, with brief moments of reprehensibility. Whoever the author was, he seems a mostly terrible person. The only interlude in which he approaches humanity is in his affair with a maid, with whom he appears truly in love. This portion of My Secret Life is just about the only palatable one. Again, I\u2019m not a moralist, but without any emotional framework, this guy is just a junkie looking to score his next hit.Since My Secret Life, at least the version I read, is mostly disembodied sex, you don\u2019t learn a whole lot about the author or his friends. (He claims to be keeping them anonymous). At one point, he mentions some buddies who went off to fight in Crimea, which gives us a time-point. If you look closely enough, though, you will find interesting details about Victorian life. However, this takes a bit of squinting, and getting this just for some Victorian flavor is akin to the way men used to read Playboy for the articles. This is a book that you probably shouldn\u2019t read. There are other books more deserving of your time. Actually, literally every other book that has ever been written is probably more deserving of your time. Every book. Of course, that\u2019s the very reason I got this in the first place. So act accordingly."}, {"userName": "Flora", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/873514-flora", "userReview": "You will read few books as bizarre as this one. It's the multi-volume memoir of an anonymous \"Victorian gentleman,\" recounting his prodigious sexual exploits with a bewildering variety of partners -- ranging from whores to little girls to young men to aristocratic ladies -- and the weird thing is, it's way too weird to be firmly shelved on the \"Victorian Porn\" shelf, a la \"The Pearl.\" It's too compulsive, too fixated on inconsequential detail to be serving the principally utilitarian interests of the genre. (It's also too self-involved to be truly pornographic: there's humor here, but it's minimal.) The book was originally printed by a private European publisher, and the printing was extremely small -- a handful of copies -- and somehow one of them ended up, about thirty years ago, in the hands of Grove Press. Theories abound as to the identity of the author, but it's the anonymity of the author that's the key to its nature: as an archive of experience, a collection of worldly encounters that matter mainly in their enumeration. This is autobiography as mathematics."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1092227-robin", "userReview": "Sort of hard to form an opinion of this book. On one hand it it is at first disturbing because the writer begins with recollections of being abused as a child and then moves on to his harassing, exploiting, raping, purchasing and seducing women. At times he seems almost delusional in his belief that every woman \"wants it\" so i suspect that some of what he believes are seductions are really not as consenting as he thinks. On the other hand, here is a rare insight into the sexual psychology of the Victorian man and also some of \"unsavory\" particulars of the time. (Bathroom habits and lack of undergarments for one thing, access to abortions for another.) I wrote a paper on gender and sexual anxieties as portrayed in Victorian fiction, and that was how i heard about this book, and I wish I would have had this for that paper. It's fascinating to watch the narrator as he cycles through immature to worldly, powerful to powerless, confident to sheepish, and lewd to ashamed.There are some issues with knowing how much we can trust this narrator, but more important than the truth of each incident, I think, is getting a glimpse at the way language and desires are put together: I have lost track of all the slang and nicknames for body parts and functions. It is always interesting to see that the things we assumed were so repressed at this time had multiple descriptive phrases. Something about his accumulators rogering to frig a wench's motte with his pego...??? So randy!Basically, if you are looking for a sexy sexy book, this might disappoint you. Every page has sex and bawdy talk, but some of it is sort of depressing and/or morally sickening. I don't mean that in a \"depraved acts\" sort of way, but that for me it was hard to read these \"true stories\" about Walter's mistreatment of so many of these girls and servants, and yet at times I also felt sorry for him. His beliefs about his body and illness and his overpowering need for women are honest and almost pitiful. i wish i could know more about his non-secret life.To sum up my review: This is a gold mine for anyone researching Victorian literature, sexual psychology or sociology. But, if you're looking for a jolly good time this won't hit the right note with everyone."}, {"userName": "Catalina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10427008-catalina", "userReview": "Boy, is this really happening in the Victorian era? I remember so well reading Sense and Sensibility and waiting for the bloody kiss to happen...but noooo, you can't have that in a Victorian novel; while the reality was actually so bloody obscene :D!So this novel was interesting first for putting into light the 'underground' sexual life of women and men in the very puritan Victorian-era and second, as a step in the erotica evolution: from Life of an Amorous Man(where explicit descriptions were close to zero) to Anais Nin's beautiful sensual images, or if you want, to the amazing sexual fantasy of Pauline R\u00e9age!I admired very much the author philosophy (which should be applied even by some modern persons), therefore i'll use it to conclude : \"Many who have not experienced our pleasures, consider them bestial. But the various bodily functions such as eating, drinking, urinating, copulating are their equally bestial? No: they consider them quite natural, to which all indulge. And then so are the erotic games that a man and a woman conceive: everything is permitted if they do it for their mutual pleasure. The uncouth, the dull that consider women only as a mass of meat with a hole, which did not fancy, which are unable to conceive sexual pleasures, which copulate only when the excess of semen makes the cock eager, they are precisely the bestial ones, because their behavior is very similar to that of animals. The couple blessed with imagination who can conceive games unknown to animals rises the intercourse to a spiritual height, makes it a dream of the senses, does of lust and love a poetic, ethereal, celestial delirium\"!"}, {"userName": "Laura E.

It offers an unparalleled glimpse into Victorian sexuality, from everything to social attitudes toward the female body (generally and unsurprisingly, they're there for male consumption), sexual awakening and exploration (not always consensual), relationships between the monied class and their domestics, prostitution (by choice and by chance), birth control and abortion, and underwear and toilet habits.Being a diary, it can be tedious in places where the author recounts multiple events in extreme, sometimes monotonous detail. But the author is also self-deprecating and achingly human throughout much of the volume. It's fascinating to read about something discussed so little during the actual period, and in the author's own words."}, {"userName": "Lee Rene", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1414244-lee-rene", "userReview": "I can't really rate this book as an enjoyable read but My Secret Life is invaluable for anyone interested in Victoriana. The voluminous work details the exploits of a bounder who rarely looks for sexual partners from his own social class but instead rapes and pillages the vaginas and other orifaces of poor girls, maids, sailors and street prostitues with joyous abandon. My Secret Life is more 19th Century social history than erotica. Emotions are rarely involved, the sex often brutal, the author's contempt for those from the \"lower\" classes and women as a whole at all times palpable."}, {"userName": "Margot Note", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3127665-margot-note", "userReview": "I could write oodles on this book.

Besides that, this 'gentleman' annoyed the hell out of me several times along the book. He was a real jerk to a lot of girls. I'm no feminist, but come on... he acted like an idiot too many times.

Nonetheless, a fabulous (if sometimes depressing) read--- though more for what it says about Victorian fantasies than for the sex itself. Of course, Steven Marcus' essay on \"My Secret Life\" in his \"The Other Victorians\" is a classic, and looks at the social and psychological background to the book.

It is the sexual memoir of a well-to-do gentleman who began at an early age to keep a diary of his erotic behavior. He continues this record for over 40 years, creating in the process a unique social & psychological document. Authorship of the book is mysterious. Henry Spencer Ashbee, a book collector, writer & bibliographer notable for his particular focus on sexuality is suspected by some to be \"Walter\". He is very likely the compiler of the book's index, the provider of some editorial assistance & the person who saw the text into print.Gershon Legman was 1st to link \"Walter\" & Ashbee in Legman's introduction to the 1962 reprints of Ashbee's bibliographies. The 1966 Grove Press edition of 'My Secret Life' included an expanded version of that essay.More recently, however, Ian Gibson's 'The Erotomaniac: The Secret Life of Henry Spencer Ashbee' (2001, ISBN 0-571-19619-5) provides a detailed review of circumstantial evidence arguing that Ashbee wrote 'My Secret Life', presumably weaving fantasy & anecdotes from friends in with his own real-life experiences. Just prior to this, in May 2000, Channel 4 UK broadcast a documentary, 'Walter-The Secret Life of a Victorian Pornographer', which also claimed that Ashbee was Walter.", "title": "My Secret Life: An Erotic Diary of Victorian London", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/772008.My_Secret_Life", "average": 3.44, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1421685384l/772008.jpg", "reviews": 64, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/274752.Henry_Spencer_Ashbee", "name": "Henry Spencer Ashbee"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5773429.James_R_Kincaid", "name": "James R.
