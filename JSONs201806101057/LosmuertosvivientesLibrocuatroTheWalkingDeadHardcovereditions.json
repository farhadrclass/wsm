Just wow. And I'm not sure that is all a good thing. This is just one heartbreaking event after another, and at a certain point you have to wonder if this is just an exercise in seeing just how far the characters (and the reader) can be pushed before they snap ( give up the series) We start off this volume seeing how the crew has settled into some sort of domestic normalcy. Lori and Rick seemed to have come to terms with her one time infidelity( I mean, come ON! It was the end of the world for Christsakes! Let it be already!) and Glenn and Maggie take a shot at marriage, and possibly a baby. Speaking of babies, little baby Judy enters the world via the quickest delivery ever. Carl likes his sister. Carol seems semi balanced considering she tried to off herself recently, and Michone is shell shocked but being comforted by tyrese. Everyone goes home a winner.But underneath it all things are not what they seem. Carol cries in the middle of the night. Dale looses his foot after a botched gasoline run. And there's still the threat of the governor. The other shoe is just waiting to drop. And drop it does.It all starts with carol going off the deep end and committing suicide by zombie. Right after that the governor shows up and shoots a bit even though he has a tank and then gets so overwhelmed by the ten people there that he runs off again. Maybe the baby's cries scared him off? I dunno, it was sort of scary but from here on out it just became a weird odd cycle of the governor attacks then leaves but ooooh he might return and then OH he DOES return and rinse, spin, repeat. The Govn. Is crazier and crazier as the novel goes on, more and more unbalanced and enraged, though I guess I would be too if someone cut off my dick. It just got a bit comic bookish, if ya know what I mean. The last few moments were really tough. I knew alot of people were going to die, but as I type this, I am struggling to remember if there's anyone left besides Rick and Carl. Damn Carl, of all people! Lori and the baby bit it in one shotgun blast, Andrea got flipped over the RV, and if she's still around after that AND the gunshot wound to the head, I'm out. Tyrese got his head chopped off, and Herschel waited for death. Oh, wait Michone is still squirreled away in Woodbury. Or is she? I'm still trying to understand how she got away in her last scuffle and why the governor was just like oh fuck it, I don't care about her anymore, lets go make our ( third) last stand at the prison. Sigh.Also I have to repeat a bit if another review here with what the hell is wrong with all of the women in this series? On the surface they are all badass and strong, gun toting amazons, but are just one breath away from sewing, cooking, or wondering if their ass looks too fat in riot gear, eventhough they hold down the fort and are sharp shooters. And off course, all of them are like \" yeah, let's have a BABY!\" Cause Lori made it look super fun with no formula or medical care. Wtf.Still loved reading it, can't wait for the next but I was a bit stumped by some of the ruthlessness in this one."}, {"userName": "Douglas  Craven", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12173871-douglas-craven", "userReview": "I am not a prude and I don't mind violence. I hate this volume. HATE it. I was captivated by the first two bound volumes of _The Walking Dead_. Volume 3 changed this. The brutality that the author visits on one of his characters is hard to read but, at least, in keeping with the savage survivalist theme. I thought, \"Well, I got through that.\" I bought Volume 4 hoping for a return to the harsh, but not downright cruel, plot of the first two volumes. No spoilers, but the end of this book is so pointlessly, graphically brutal that I threw it across the room. Why bother inventing characters if you plan to do this sort of thing to them? Again, it is not the violence that bothers me. It is that the author seems to intent on showing us how \"gritty\" he can be that he is willing to brutalize his characters and his reader just to top himself. The last four pages of this volume put me right off this series, and that is too bad because it had such potential. Irredeemably harsh. Brutal for the sake of brutality. Avoid."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3987603-holly", "userReview": "Holy cow! Robert Kirkman is not afraid to kill off main characters!This installation gives us the birth of Lori's baby - Rick doesn't want to know if he's the father or if Shane is (he picked up on the fact that Lori slept with Shane during Shane's last rant) and they settle back into what passes for stable family life after the zombie apocalypse. After that, everything goes straight to hell. Glen is shot in the chest during a supply run, but lives because he's wearing the body armor they found in the prison. Carol commits suicide by zombie, leaving Sophia orphaned in Rick & Lori's care. Dale gets bitten, but they manage to save his life by amputating his lower leg. When the Governor and his goons attack the prison, the casualties add up fast - Rick is shot in the abdomen (but isn't killed) and Andrea gets a graze wound to the head. The Governor retreats, and the group falls apart without Rick's guidance. Michonne and Tyreese decide to strike at the Governor while he's retreating, while Andrea, Dale, the twins, Sophia, Glen and Maggie decide to run for it and leave the rest of the group. Tyreese is captured and beheaded by the Governor in an attempt to make the last of the group in the prison surrender, but when that plan doesn't work, they attack again. Alice, Axel and Patricia are killed in the battle and Billy is killed after surrendering. But the true shocker is Lori - she and the baby are killed as they're making a run for the getaway truck with Rick and Carl.At the end of the book, the only people left alive from the original group are Rick, Carl, Andrea, Dale, Sophia, Glenn, Maggie and the twin boys. The prison has fallen to the Governor's people (the Governor himself is killed shortly after the battle, when his followers realizes that they've killed a woman and a baby.) Michonne may be alive, but she's split from the group at this point. Wow.

You know how we're trained via every television show and Hollywood film we've ever seen (and even most books we've read) to trust that the main characters we see stick around for a while and get good character development are the...well, main characters of the series? If you can't handle this becoming not true in horrifying and violent ways, don't read this. I'm not kidding. Put it down and walk away. Give it to a friend. Donate it to a library. Anything. Just get it out of your world to remove the temptation to read it and thereby torment yourself. Because once you've read it you can't take it back.I read this in a car en route from one Northwestern city to another. Being trapped in that car with me for an hour after finishing this book was something other than pleasant for my driving buddies. Disbelief, shock, grief, anger...I did them all. Now I've settled on some admittedly unrealistic and self-delusional brand of hope. Because the worst of the character-decimating madness all goes down in the last 20 or so pages, so we don't get much aftermath, just the punch in the gut and then fade to black. And maybe...maybe people who looked dead really aren't? Unfortunately, I'll have to wait a while to find out because holds for Book 5 at my local library are about a month out. Anticipation is good for us, right?Okay, end-of-book shock factor aside, there's a lot of payoff in this one. Storylines and nuggets that were set up in books two and three bear some meaty fruit in these pages. Much of it unpretty, but that's part of what we're here for, right? A tale of bunnies and unicorns this is not. The characters (or what's left of them, anyway) keep gaining depth and complexity, maybe more so in this collection than the first three. I'm starting to like them, even when they're overreactive dicks to each other or walk blindly into situations I want to smack them for--the ditzy blonde in the horror film who goes into the basement alone with a dying flashlight just after the power's been cut to see what that noise was? Yeah, each of these characters has been that girl at this point. Fortunately, they aren't her all the time, or even most of the time.So, still loving everything I loved about the previous books in the series, and apparently more attached to the characters than I've been admitting to myself because I'm pretty pissed about how this one ended. Which just means I'm chomping at the bit to read the next."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4303446-megan", "userReview": "This series just keeps getting better and better. This is definitely one of my favorites of the series so far. It's also probably the most depressing as of yet. Several people die (even some that you wouldn't expect) and lots of limbs and body parts are lost. At this rate, pretty soon all the characters are just gonna be an army of stumps and amputees. I like that the creators aren't afraid to kill off some of the main characters. No one's safe in these kinds of conditions and it's unrealistic to expect your favorites or the most seemingly important characters to survive to see a happily ever after. I also really liked The Governor. Well, I didn't like him; I loved to hate him. He's an awesome villain and you just can't wait for him to finally die and get his comeuppance. He seems like an extremely complex character and I really want to know his back story, especially in regards to his zombie daughter. So I'm really happy The Walking Dead: Rise of The Governor is going to be published October 11th. Another thing I don't think I've mentioned yet in my previous reviews of The Walking Dead hardcovers is all the interesting stuff they put in the back of the books. Robert Kirkman writes some notes and explanations next to some sketches and discusses the development of the series and characters while also offering up some really cool references to other Walking Dead memorabilia and art. For example, in this issue, he mentions Clayburn Moore's painted statues which can be found here: http://www.csmoorestudio.com/Moore_Th.... So that's pretty neat. But the best part of the bonus material in the back of the books are the full-color illustrations. They make everything that much more graphic and intense and they're so much more detailed than the small black-and-white frames of the comic panels. They're like the cherry on top of the zombie story sundae."}, {"userName": "Sarah Yasmin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6327084-sarah-yasmin", "userReview": "Holla TWD fans!So I finished reading this Book Four and WOW!! All I can say is the stories really gets better for each issues! But heartbreaking at the same time. Aha! Also there's violent scene (which I like it).As from my previous review, Michonne beats Philips the Governor so hard and left him nearly to death. Yeah I already knew the Governor is not dead yet because I watched the episode on TWD tv series! But this time, I read the whole stories here. On how Governor survive after been tortured by Michonne. He planned to attack the prison for months. He comes to the prison with full preparation, full energy, tanks and guns to seek revenge! He even spread bad thought about those people in prison to his people. He's evil guys. I cannot tell how much I hate him. Before the Governor and his people came, Andrea, Dale, Maggie, Glenn and Sophia left the prison because they knew this would happen! They didn't want to risk their life in that prison anymore.Previously, Lori got pregnant and deliver baby in the prison. And also, ANDREA IS A HERO! She came back to the prison, alone, and help her people that been attacked by Governor over there. I adore her for her ability to shoot accurately and she is BETTER THAN EVERY MAN over there! It was so heartbreaking to see Lori and her baby being shot by the Governor and his people. I never thought Kirkman would kill all those character! I mean, Tyreese, Hershel, Patricia, Alice, Billy, Axel, Lori and Judy are all dead. Rick and Carl are safe and left the prison. Same goes to Michonne. She's all alone and its sad actually to see the part when she slowly walk away from the prison. Hmm.Phew, that was awesome. And now lets see what will happen to Carl and Rick.

The prison has once again become a site of drama and conflict, and the characters seem alive again. There are definitely still some incredibly shocking moments--truly twisted and heartbreaking things happen in this volume, and though I'm not a queasy reader, I had to stop a few times and collect myself. The plot is definitely becoming more grotesque and more complex, especially as a few characters are tested beyond their limits and as a few flee the scene. And even though it has resulted in some turns that I would have preferred happened differently, I most appreciated that the characters are once again being pushed--their psychological, physical, emotional limits are being tested and the story is well-developed enough to make you interested in following them through the next volume."}, {"userName": "Barbi Faye (The Book Fae)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16673801-barbi-faye-the-book-fae", "userReview": "This is a hardcover bind up of twelve issues of The Walking Dead and we join the fun already in progress.

It's a book about zombies, there's bound to be some unpleasantness, after all... I just needed a little time to get over the bad things that happened to the characters I'd grown used to. To be fair, any book that has such that kind of impact on me must be pretty good, especially given how few comics actually cause me to respond to their characterization. Kirkman is a writer with an eye for good dialogue and interpersonal relationships, and the black and white art perfectly suits the story he is telling. This volume collects issues 36-48 of the comic (which is up to 75 or so now, so I've got a way to go to catch up), and marks a fairly major change in the set-up of the story. It isn't a good change (for the characters, anyway), although I think I was a little less upset by this volume's cruelty, perhaps because I'd been a bit numbed by the previous one.
