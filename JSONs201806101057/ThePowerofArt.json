I\u2019ve seen the documentary, but I\u2019m going to tell you about it anyway. This is a documentary to be seen and not read about. The filming, editing and direction are almost as breathtaking as the artworks discussed. This is documentary film making at its best. You are NEVER spoken down to. He NEVER assumes you will know something only the initiated will know. Schama is a God among men and, a bit like David Attenborough, he could talk about grass growing and I would be in a trance (in fact, I may have listened to Attenborough talking about grass growing, I\u2019m almost certain I must have). I don\u2019t care if there will always be a Britain \u2013 as long as there will always be a BBC, that is all I ask.The other confession I have to make is that I don\u2019t do Art \u2013 in fact, not even art. I would love to be able to art, but it just isn\u2019t one of those things I have any talent for. I look at paintings and photographs and I\u2019m stunned by the idea that someone could think to compose an image in that way, light it just perfectly, use that image as a metaphor in such a way as to twist my lungs out of me so that I can\u2019t breathe \u2013 but that is not what I do. I am completely incapable of arting and it breaks my heart.Everyone ought to have a story about why they never became the new Picasso \u2013 you know, a \u2018the day I learnt I would never be heavy-weight champion of the world\u2019 story. And this is mine. At high school I was always crap at Art, but one day we were asked to do an \u2018abstract\u2019 painting. I spent the lesson doodling something in the corner of a vast white sheet of paper \u2013 something tight-arsed and tiny, as was my want. Anyway, when it was nearly time to pack everything away a friend came over and while he was leaning on the table talking to me \u2013 possibly whilst gesticulating so as to explain to me just how crap my painting was \u2013 he knocked over my paints and they splashed all over the paper I had been working on. I carefully picked everything up and took it to the sink \u2013 let the paint drip off the paper, cleaned the desk and left the paper there to dry off while I went to clean my hands. When I got back the art teacher was standing over my desk and I was just about to say, \u201cLook, I can explain,\u201d when she said, \u201cTrevor, this is the best work you\u2019ve ever done, look at how free it all is \u2013 I\u2019m going to hang this up\u201d. And she did. (New born talent can sustain neither too little nor too much praise \u2013 I can\u2019t remember where I heard that, but it is always part of this story) I knew then with utter certainty, as I\u2019ve never known anything else before or since, that art and I would always be star-crossed lovers.Meeting some of the greatest of artists can be a bit of a shock. Here you are going to get up close and personal with Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Picasso and Rothko. I\u2019m not sure I would like to be stuck beside any of these guys at a dinner party. And not just the ones that topped themselves \u2013 all of them are anything but \u2018fun guys\u2019. The first couple are certifiable. But God, could they Art. Generally, each episode looks at a master and we get to see his master work, we get to see it from all angles, so to speak. Take Guernica as a case in point \u2013 we learn of the fascist bombing of the town, we hear of Picasso saying to some Gestapo scum holding up a postcard image of the painting and asking if Picasso did this piece of degenerate filth. \u201cNo, you did.\u201d (If that story isn\u2019t true, it ought to be). We learn of the allegorical stories that most affected Picasso, that fascinated him throughout life and how these became the archetypal images in Guernica \u2013 the raging bull, the gored horse, the candle against evil. And then we have the last few moments of this documentary \u2013 possibly the most powerful and moving of the entire series \u2013 with Colin Powell at a press conference after justifying the invasion of Iraq and how they had Guernica (a copy, obviously) covered before the press conference follwing his fatal UN speech. The line apparently said by his media advisors that the painting would be \u2018too distracting\u2019 is painfully apt with all of the deepest and most apparent of ironies.The Rothko is the least impressive episode of this series. Although you do get to see an actor play a very young, and very high camp, Schama marching up to the Tate and being stopped dead by a room full of Rothkos. A friend of mine, just back from Britain, had much the same experience. Well, sans mincing, I hope.The Van Gogh love of yellow paint is an image that will haunt me. As was the beautifully quick cut to Simon saying something like, \u201cIt was much worse\u201d just before this. I watched much of this series in an aspect not too different from Bernini\u2019s St Teresa. This really is a magnificent series \u2013 there must be a way of praising it too highly, but I\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t found it just yet."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly", "userReview": "Look, you either hate Schama or you love him. It just has to be that way- his personality, definite opinions and style are all over his work, and he makes absolutely no apologies for it. I happen to fall into the love it category. Is it \"good\" history? No. But it's incredibly compelling history- he tells you the kind of story that makes you want to know more about it. It sets out a rich, decadent feast, drama-ramas it up and tells you how it is. I'm more entertained watching his documentaries than I am with most comedians. Whatevs- people like Schama are the reason why history departments get supported, and people like me want to join the profession. I'll get trained by a different historian, but if I can become half the storyteller he is, I'm all set.Also- No, don't actually read the book. See the mini-series. The companion book does offer you awesome pictures, but the documentary with his voice, his weird twitchy tics, the dramatic lighting and ridiculous music is the way to go. Get some popcorn and just be ready to be entertained."}, {"userName": "Renata", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata", "userReview": "My coffee table book that is a go to read whenever I need a dose of art pleasure and a brain break from the mundane.

But the book is an always available calmer pleasure."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1041716-michael", "userReview": "If you're like me you took an art history survey in college and then maybe a Euro-pass tour including the Louvre, British Museum, etc., and walked out thinking you knew something about art. That's a bit like owning a copy of \"Beatles 1\" and thinking you know the Beatles. In this companion book to a British TV series, Schama takes you under the skin and the canvas of 10 masters from Caravaggio to 1970s. The book's premise is that certain artworks have the power to elicit emotion and even action. Why is this? Schama actually answers that question. This is not a primer or a \"lives of the artists.\" Schama assumes you know something (which in my case is literally true--I know something, but not much) about the artists and their times. He fills in plenty on such topics as religious worship in the 17th century, construction of St. Peter's, the French revolution, and the bombing of Guernica. This really is art criticism at its best. There is little painterly (or sculptor-ly) jargon and lots of living, breathing analysis and history (and even dirt on topics like Bernini's slatternly, adulterous girlfriend, fully realized in a bust that blazes with concupiscence). He never fawns over his subjects while recognizing their flaws and laziness as well as their genius. Unlike almost other \"companion\" books, which take a scrapbook approach, this one has real substance and easily stands alone (although my mother tells me the DVD of the series is also excellent). The book is nicely produced and beautifully illustrated with a few well-chosen plates. Schama's descriptive prose is so fine that you easily resist the urge to go to Google images (at least until later) because you can't tear away from this book. ADDENDUM AUGUST 2012: I was visiting my mother and watched the DVD sections on Caravaggio and Bernini. They were ridiculously overamped (and also felt padded and repetitive). When describing Bernini's \"Ecstacy of St Teresa,\" in which the floating stone nun appears to have a cataclysmic orgasm, Schama appears to have a involuntary wet dream of his own while indulging in some anachronistic purple pornographic prose. Then he has the nerve to add that the statue has inspired quite a lot of bad writing. Case in point."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2604014-carol", "userReview": "What great book (and film)! Schama has chosen to focus on many of my favorite artists-- Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Picasso & Rothko. I have previously studied many of the artists in depth except Bernini and Rothko. The film is great and the book excellent -- large color plates, well written. I also learn a great deal about Borromini."}, {"userName": "Gadi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2065771-gadi", "userReview": "I couldn\u2019t put it down. One of the most compelling introductions to any subject I\u2019ve ever read. Now, in museums, in classes, in my room surfin\u2019 the net, I find myself remembering the sordid, passionate lives of Caravaggio and Van Gogh and Rothko and David. And Schama portrays each one in such vividly articulated descriptions, from their life to their artwork.I must say, though, that I despise the Rothko chapter\u2014maybe because I can\u2019t stand his art, either. Who gives a shit about red lines on a canvas. And sure, no, I\u2019m not one to criticize modern art\u2014although after reading this book, you\u2019ll feel prepared.If I can choose one thing about this book, it\u2019s the way Schama constantly attempts to propel emotions into us, to drive them in like darts, describing each painting as if it was a world within its own, our world, our reality, as if it was burnt onto our eyelids, as if we were blind and needed to know exactly how to feel, how to understand. Incredible."}, {"userName": "Barry", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1396511-barry", "userReview": "This is a convenient vehicle for Schama, who, as much as he loves art, really likes to argue.Schama is self-aggrandizing, melodramatic, irritating and truly compelling. He injects his out-size personality into the book and it's better for it.One can certainly quibble with his choices of which pieces of art best represent turning points of art history (or according to Schama's overinflated prose, history in general) but his choices make for a lively book.The Power of Art is aimed at people like me, someone who doesn't have an art history background. Rather than trying to swamp the reader with loads of facts and dates, Schama concentrates on a few key pieces and spends enough time analyzing them so that the reader gets a flavour of the work and the context and circumstances of the masterpiece.Is it the best art book ever? Probably not. But it's fun to read."}, {"userName": "Abhishek", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/327300-abhishek", "userReview": "Schama has a tendency to harangue...but his sincerity and off-the-cuff humor more than makes up for this. Moreover, when you compare this with the intense passion that went into the making of each painting and artist in this book, you more than get carried in the stride.Plus the book has Grrrreat pictures! :DI think my favorite were the chapters on David and Caravaggio (potboiling soap-operas both).I only wish his analysis of the artists was a tad more multi-dimensional...he tends to stick to the same (art is power/power is art) thesis throughout the book, irrespective of the artist or the period.Overall a book that every art-lover must read and judge for oneself."}, {"userName": "Liz De Coster", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/258616-liz-de-coster", "userReview": "I took my time with this book (and the BBC-produced DVD series), and it was worth it. The author's strong opinions, whether the reader agrees or disagrees, keeps the reader very much involved. The focus on one or two memorable pieces and the carefully selected historic and biographic details prevent the work from becoming overwhelming."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113627-joyce", "userReview": "As a historian Schama has always excelled at \"reading\" paintings for the materialist details -- what they can show us about daily life and historicizing fantasy -- but as he gets older he seems to be allowing himself to argue for the role of individualism and belief in the creation of material objects.Here he could be read as appearing to glamorize the myth of the rebel artist, because he certainly does not shy away from the seamy details of almost every life he recounts. His favored subjects are chockablock with murder, assault, bankruptcy, alcoholism, whoring, and suicide. I was most surprised to learn that marble-pure Bernini had hired someone to slash the face of his mistress; my brother, who recommended this book to me, was blown away by the details of Jean-Louis David's political perfidy and how it was reflected in his changes of subject matter and style.I think a more mature reading though would be that each artist truly grappled with their own often-treacherous beliefs, invariably in ways that were extremely inconvenient and detrimental to their careers. Over and over we read the story of an artistic genius who works hard for years to reach the pinnacle of success... and then seemingly cannot help himself from self-destructing by pursuing a line of thought that is uncommercial at best. It's striking how often this obsession is of a spiritual nature, although the historical line of deep belief changes from straight damnation through tragic inevitability to political concerns to personal expression -- in line with the mode of modern thought generally.A note about the book itself: Schama has always had the best production and rights-clearance teams in the biz, because his texts are so beautifully done. I was in a period of not buying books at all, much less $50 five-pounders on glossy paper... but this thing exemplifies what a BOOK can do for you that a Kindle currently cannot. Worth it for the intelligent selection and quality of the repros alone."}, {"userName": "Uco Library", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4571979-uco-library", "userReview": "Historian Schama certainly has a powerful method of telling a story. He tells the tales of eight different artists Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Picasso and Rothko. The book was written to accompany the television series published by the BBC but it is not necessary to have seen the series to enjoy the book. I read the book several years before watching the series and after watching the series picked up the book again. Reading through it again I could imagine the visual sets that the series provides.Schama writes about these eight artists and their work focusing on a pivotal piece for each individual. The sections on each artist are engaging and the accompanying illustrations are wonderful. His writing style reads like an action movie with killings, excessive self-mutilation, speech impediments, imprisonment, suicide, and insanity. In his perceptive style, Schama reveals the lives of these artists and the difficult situations they overcame while developing their artistic talents. He simultaneously explores the social, political, and cultural factors which facilitate a greater understanding of what the artists were facing at the time he was creating. He explains what we are looking at and helps us understand the passions at play when the artist undertook his works, putting the person up front rather than the genre. Most of the artists are individuals I have admired, yet he manages to remove them from the hero status that I assigned to them and turn them into struggling artist with their own demons. This is an engaging book that can be read as a whole or in parts and will be enjoyed by anyone interested in the arts."}, {"userName": "Erik", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1097503-erik", "userReview": "I have only read two of the essays - Bernini and Van Gogh - though Simon Schama is one of those public intellectuals for whom I respect so much.

It's ten years old. It was cheap. I've been watching the DVD's (about ten hours worth) and its a good show. He makes the artists come alive and gives a great deal of history and back story. Problem for me is that I seriously wonder how much of that back story is true or just myth that has been floating around. It makes for good TV though, and makes the artworks vibrant and interesting. My one complaint would be that the televised versions of some of the works of art seem to have been altered - Host is talking about the brilliant colors in Turner's Slave Ship - I grab the book and flip it open to that painting. Its a very dull, almost blurry mis-mash. I can't see any of the detail that he's pointing out on my TV screen. I figure its just a cheap illustration in my book, and I go online to the Boston Museum (owner of the painting) and pull up their digital collection. There's is more distinct than the one in the book, but its still not the colors I see on my TV screen. What gives?

Rembrandt suffered heavy personal losses both in his wives and children and in possessions.He went his own way, contrary to conventional representation of portraits and groups. He got away with it with The Nightwatch but saw Claudius Civilis removed from the municipal building after some weeks. Van Gogh's ear incident is clarified in sober words and so is his relationship with Gauguin. His personal career and life is briefly but lucidly sketched.Picasso gets his due : les belles dames d 'Avignon was revolutionary and Guernica his masterpiece. The painter seems to have rebelled against traditional painting and didn't shrink from showing ugliness.You could also read his art as as reaction against the new medium of photography.Mere likeness could not be the main goal since photography was unsurpassable in this respect.Rothko finally seems to be Schama's favourite but I still can't see the power of his work.

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I read this as a stand-alone book, not a companion piece to the PBS series of the same name, as I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d be able to stand Schama\u2019s endless attempts to dramatize and eulogize everything, implying that there is somehow meaning in even the most minute detail of the canvas, not the mention the personal lives of the artists.Schama devotes forty or fifty pages a piece to eight artists presented in chronological order: Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Picasso, and Rothko. The text is interlarded with the most sumptuous full-plate color representations of some of the artists\u2019 most well-known and recognized work. One of the biggest advantages of the book is that, while technical aspects of the individual pieces of art are discussed, they are not put in a vacuum: Schama simultaneously emphasizes cultural, political, and social factors which facilitate a greater and fuller understanding of what he\u2019s talking about.Depending on the reader (or, so I hear, the viewer of the eponymous PBS series), you will find Schama\u2019s prepossessing gregariousness and endless apotheosizing somewhat disconcerting. I certainly did. But at the same time, I recognize that if this is what it takes to get someone who has never previously cared about art into a museum to leave astounded and wanting to come back, then it has ultimately performed its job quite nicely. Introductory art educators or those who wish to gain a fundamental familiarity with the above artists will benefit most from this book. But those who already have this knowledge, as well as how the biographical information and the artwork interact with one another, will learn precious little. I must say, though, that the dozens upon dozens of color plates make the book well worth its $50 price tag (though from the looks of things, it\u2019s available for less than half that on Amazon)."}, {"userName": "Subowal", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12594799-subowal", "userReview": "\"GREAT ART HAS DREADFUL MANNERS.\" So begins the introduction by the author to his book about eight artists: Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Picasso and Rothko. Schama also made the BBC documentary series on these artists with the same name. BBC hasn't made the videos available in India, but the book, fortunately, is easily available.\"The hushed reverence of the gallery can fool you into believing masterpieces are polite things, visions that soothe, charm and beguile, but actually they are thugs. Merciless and wily, the greatest paintings grab you in a headlock, rough up your composure and then proceed in short order to rearrange your sense of reality\" - so continues Schama's introduction and perfectly sets the tone for what follows.As Schama concedes later in the introduction \"a great deal of supremely accomplished art has been created by artists who have preferred self-effacement to heroic self-dramatization, who have wanted more modest goals for their work: the imitation of nature; the representation of beauty, or both at the same time.\" However, this book is not about such artists.These artists didn't see themselves as craftsmen serving the needs of their commissions but were fully conscious of the power of their art on par with philosophy, poetry or religion. They led combative lives and came in frequent conflict with the establishment. Their personal lives were anything but tranquil and it shows in their work.It would have been a difficult task to live up to the promise created by such an introduction but Schama succeeds. I have seen and admired the works of all these artists and read about them extensively, yet going through the beautifully produced pages of this book gave me a fresh perspective and a new appreciation for them and their work.

I'm glad I read the book; having more time to consider the many beautiful artworks contained within in and think about the themes raised definitely enhances the experience.I particularly enjoyed the Rembrandt and Turner chapters; perhaps that is just personal artistic preference! All the stories were well-told, the inclusion of sculpture as well as painting was a particular highlight as I learned a lot more about that particular art-form. Taking time to read the book made it very clear just how many underlying themes linked the different artists; realism, colour, the viewer as participant and so on. I struggled a bit more with the Picasso and Rothko chapters - there were a lot of sentences that didn't appear to say very much. On reflection, this might have just been that their artistic beliefs are further away from \"normal\" and harder (for me) to understand. The life story sections were just as interesting as other chapters though; Schama tells a great story and isn't afraid of pointing out when the artists went through less than brilliant phases.If you're interested in art but need a bit of guidance, I'd really recommend this book; it picks out some well-known but not overdone artists who all had incredibly interesting lives and approaches to art. The use of one picture as a way to tell the story also works very well; I learned a lot about art I wasn't even aware of until picking up this book."}, {"userName": "Ninja", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1169678-ninja", "userReview": "Schama has a great way with words. Caution though. You have to read him with the understanding that in some cases he is stating his opinion and conjecture for dramatic effect. Some of what he says and speculates on should be viewed as just that - interesting speculation and not necessarily historical fact. But having said that, he successfully forces the reader to see art and the artist as something that can not be separated. He will not let us see these men he focuses on, as somehow conduits through which god makes a powerful piece of art. They are all too human, affected by their passions, successes and failures that shape the timeless art they have left us with. And so he explores their lives, adventures and misadventures and tries to understand how their lives and times affected the art they made. He is trying to jolt us into seeing the importance and mystery of art. Don't walk by a Picasso. Try to understand it. Explore how it makes you feel because that is what the artists are doing - trying to make us feel. So if he makes a point or turns a phrase just for dramatic effect, he is merely doing so just as the great masters made drama from their brushes or chisels. Art, says Schama, is supposed to make us feel, think, and if necessary, change."}, {"userName": "Achtung Englander", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18273120-achtung-englander", "userReview": "There is little doubt that Simon Schama put a lot of passion into this book. A personal discovery on why he selected particular pieces from Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Picasso and Rothko and why those pieces speak to him. Why, to him, they have the power of art. This being my first (but not my last) Schama book I found his style of writing quite high brow but conversation at the same time. That is not a bad thing, apart from learning a lot of new words, the way he structures a sentence is really enchanting. It is like Schama is talking directly to you and wants you to be part of the conversation. This is a very good companion book to the TV series as it delves into areas he does not cover in the series as well as printing a lot of the material from the show in the book. The pictures in the book are beautiful to look at and presented. It could be a little heavy to read in several sittings and I recommend reading each chapter and doing some of your own research into each of the artists. Not sure if it can be used as a straight forward education text but for a lay person wishing to understand why these artists are famous, Simon Schama's The Power Of Art is an excellent introduction."}], "description": "\"Great art has dreadful manners,\" Simon Schama observes wryly at the start of his epic and explosive exploration of the power, and whole point, of art. \"The hushed reverence of the gallery can fool you into believing masterpieces are polite things; visions that soothe, charm and beguile, but actually they are thugs. Merciless and wily, the greatest paintings grab you in a headlock, rough up your composure, and then proceed in short order to re-arrange your sense of reality. . . .\"With the same disarming force, The Power of Art propels us on an eye-opening, breathtaking odyssey, zooming in on eight extraordinary masterpieces, from Caravaggio's David and Goliath to Picasso's Guernica. Jolting us far from the comfort zone of the hushed art gallery, Schama closes in on intense make-or-break turning points in the lives of eight great artists who, under extreme stress, created something unprecedented, altering the course of art forever.The embattled heroes\u2014Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Picasso and Rothko\u2014each in his own resolute way, faced crisis with steadfast defiance, pitting passion and conviction against scorn and short-sightedness. The masterpieces they created challenged convention, shattered complacency, shifted awareness and changed the way we look at the world.With vivid storytelling and powerfully evocative descriptive passages, Schama explores the dynamic personalities of the artists and the spirit of the times they lived through, capturing the flamboyant theatre of bourgeois life in Amsterdam, the passion and paranoia of Revolutionary Paris, and the carnage and pathos of Civil War Spain.Most compelling of all, The Power of Art traces the extraordinary evolution of eight \"eye-popping\" world-class works of art. Created in a bolt of illumination, such works \"tell us something about how the world is, how it is to be inside our skins, that no more prosaic source of wisdom can deliver. And when they do that, they answer, irrefutably and majestically, the nagging question of every reluctant art-conscript . . . 'OK, OK, but what's art really for?'\"", "title": "The Power of Art", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19797.The_Power_of_Art", "average": 3.87, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385316815l/19797.jpg", "reviews": 91, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/695.Simon_Schama", "name": "Simon Schama"}], "type": ["Art", "Nonfiction", "Art", "History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19797.The_Power_of_Art", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6345723-the-power-of-art", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1426352.The_Power_of_Art", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/527523.Citizens", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/400343.Rembrandt_s_Eyes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/155314.A_History_of_Britain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21073.The_Embarrassment_of_Riches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/155239.A_History_of_Britain"]}
