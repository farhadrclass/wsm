These two characters are a chalk-and-cheese coupling. The aristocrat Thomas Lynley is steeped in tradition but fighting his destiny, wanting more meaning to his life. The council-house bred Barbara Havers is an ambivalent character, saddled with an antipathy to all that Lynley stands for combined with a chip on her shoulder. Add to the mix a doomed romantic liaison and you have an engaging sub-plot.In fact this back-story proved to be more interesting than the main storyline, possibly because the characters were familiar to me from TV dramatisations. For the first half of the novel at least I found myself viewing the others as rather tiresome minor characters, and the plot to be rather prosaic. However the second half was vastly superior. The plot thickened, the characters began to take on more differentiation, and the book eventually turned into an intriguing whodunnit. I still found myself more interested in the back story though, and I'm not sure this is altogether a good thing in a mystery series."}, {"userName": "Lewis Weinstein", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein", "userReview": "UPDATE 2/13/18 ... marvelous even on re-reading ... the murders were complicated and the tension maintained throughout ... but the essence of the story is the way those murders impact EG's continuing characters, and the relationships between those characters ...

This book deals with a closed room murder of a much hated playwriter in a stately mansion turned hotel on a snowy winter night. The house is inhabited by the people involved in producing the play, among them, being lady Helen Clyde, DI Thomas Linley's close friend. Lynley and his assistant Barbara Hayworth are at loggerheads when it comes to suspecting whodunit. ..and more murders occur.It was a taut, well.written murder mystery, which was solved impeccably towards the end, but with lots of emotional upheaval."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 3.875* of fiveThe Book Report: Inspectory Thomas Lynley, aka the eighth Earl of Asherton, is a hard-working man, but even he likes a few days' rest after chasing from pillar to post in solving brutal crimes. His rest is denied him by a call from his boss, at home, on a Sunday: A murder has occurred, in Scotland, and *only* Lynley can be trusted to investigate because it involves a famous Peer of the Realm.Uh-oh.Yeah, uh-oh and in spades, as Lynley tromps ill-temperedly up to Scotland where Scotland Yard has no legal standing and no authority and no utility, except in the titled person of Lynley himself. He's quite clearly if subtly warned: Lord Stinhurst, eminence of the London theatrical world, isn't to be troubled about small things like guilt or innocence or such-like plebeian goings-on. He's to be softly and swiftly shuffled out of the line of fire. So what does Lynley do? He brings Sergeant Barbara Havers, well-known to have a classist chip on her shoulder, to assist him, and he allows her a *lot* of leeway to poke and snoop and generally cause discomfort to the comfortable uppercrusties. (I suspect Lynley, were he corporeal, would've worn a small, snarky smile throughout this investigation.)As the investigation proceeds, awful truths come out, lives are ruined, others are altered, and some few are lost; but no one is spared from the terrible cleansing fires of truth. Even those one might wish could be. No bond, no tie, no feeling is safe when Elizabeth George goes to work.My Review: Good stuff. Unless you don't like puzzles or suspense or characters so real you'd swear you have their cell numbers somewhere if you could just find 'em, don't hesitate to start this series!"}, {"userName": "Aleshanee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27133098-aleshanee", "userReview": "Da diese Reihe schon ewig her ist, seit ich sie gelesen habe, kann ich mich wirklich an nichts mehr erinnern! Umso sch\u00f6ner weil ich das Gef\u00fchl habe, die Geschichten nochmal ganz neu zu erleben!So konnte ich auch super mitr\u00e4tseln, denn in diesem Mordfall gibt es wirklich viele Verwicklungen und auch viele Charktere, die eine Rolle spielen. Das war anfangs etwas wirr bzw. un\u00fcbersichtlich, aber im Laufe der Handlung konnte man dann doch jeden ganz gut einordnen. Vor allem, da die Autorin wirklich eine gro\u00dfartige Figurenzeichnerin ist, die jeden so pr\u00e4gnant und treffend beschreibt.Inspector Thomas Lynley hat also einiges zu tun - und dieses Mal ist er auch noch abgelenkt durch seine bohrende Eifersucht. So kenne ich ihn eigentlich nicht, bzw. hatte ich ihn gar nicht mehr in Erinnerung, denn dass er sich so von seinen Gef\u00fchlen \u00fcberrollen l\u00e4sst und dabei die Ermittlungen beeintr\u00e4chtigt, h\u00e4tte ich gar nicht von ihm erwartet.Aber zum Gl\u00fcck ist ja noch Havers bei ihm, die sich durch die vielen konventionellen Einschr\u00e4nkungen nicht von ihrem Sp\u00fcrsinn abbringen l\u00e4sst. Nat\u00fcrlich geht sie dabei auch mal wieder zu weit und sie kann ihren Mund nicht halten; was zu \u00c4u\u00dferungen f\u00fchrt die sie f\u00fcr den Moment unsympathisch erscheinen lassen. Ihre Vorurteile gegen\u00fcber der \"Oberschicht\" sind einfach nicht zu leugnen. Aber man merkt auch, dass sie sich durch die Zusammenarbeit mit Lynley mehr Gedanken macht.Helen ist ja auch wieder mit von der Partie und hat einen sehr schwierigen Stand; aber ich mag sie total gerne, weil sie so eine offene und liebenswerte Art hat!Es gibt wirklich immens viel Ermittlungsarbeit mit Befragungen und komplizierten Verbindungen zwischen den Figuren, aber gerade das hat mich total fasziniert. Nat\u00fcrlich auch der Schauplatz in dem verschneiten Hotel in Schottland, weitab vom n\u00e4chsten Dorf, ist ja geradezu pr\u00e4destiniert f\u00fcr einen englischen Krimi.An den Schreibstil hab ich mich mittlerweile wieder gew\u00f6hnt, denn er wirkt schon etwas \"veraltet\", wenn man haupts\u00e4chlich neuere B\u00fccher liest und gerade diese ganzen gesellschaftlichen Spielchen aus der Oberschicht f\u00fchlen sich f\u00fcr mich v\u00f6llig antiquiert an - aber wie gesagt: Wenn man sich da mal reingelesen hat merkt man das gar nicht mehr so arg.Gegen Ende zieht die Spannung dann richtig an, und die Autorin schafft es wieder, viele M\u00f6glichkeiten offen zu lassen und mich als Leser von einem Aha-Erlebnis zum anderen zu f\u00fchren. Die Aufkl\u00e4rung war schl\u00fcssig und hat keine Fragen offengelassen.Fazit: 4.5 Sterne\u00a9 AleshaneeWeltenwanderer"}, {"userName": "Melaszka", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4645232-melaszka", "userReview": "I'm reading the Inspector Lynley novels out of order - having been deterred from reading them for years by the rather mediocre TV series, I was hugely impressed when I eventually got round to reading some of the more recent books in the series. I'm now catching up with the earlier novels.This one was certainly compelling enough - lots of intriguing subplots, twists and red herrings - but the faults of the series were amplified and I felt the book lacked the originality which lifts the later books above much of the genre.My biggest peeve with George is that at times she peddles a Theme Park England - a fantasy England which US readers would like to believe exists, but actually doesn't. The whole aristocracy obsession in the series drives me nuts - it's neither true to life (in the UK, we don't tug our forelocks to anyone with a title any more. You wouldn't be able to influence a police investigation just by pointing out you were an earl. And I'm pretty sure that not many 20-something posh girls and guys have a live-in full-time servant in their London pied-a-terre, either, despite the fact that pretty much everybody in the series does)nor particularly attractive to anyone who believes in democracy and meritocracy. Thankfully, she's backpedalled from that a bit in the later novels in the series, but here she's in full feudal-worship mode.I feel she's trying to meet the dual needs of her American readership (allowing them to indulge their fantasies about being a lord at the same time as allowing them to, hypocritically, feel smug about the fact that they live in a society where such class distinctions have been abolished) rather than painting a genuine picture of British life.I also felt that the book creaked under the cliches of the genre - the isolated country house mystery set-up, the melodramatic theatrical setting (and the picture of theatrical life also felt very unrealistic - British theatre just does not work as depicted in this novel)Judging it purely as a mystery novel, the journey was very exciting, but the arrival at the final destination was a bit of a letdown: the \"reveals\" were predictable and/or quite dull, although the building of tension and juggling of alternative possibilities earlier in the novel had been deftly done."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40020546-megan", "userReview": "3.5 stars.A decent-enough murder mystery that had a couple of twists and turns and kept me guessing until the end. I did feel like the middle of the novel dragged out a little too much though. Plus while I liked the character Simon/St. James better in this one than I did when he was first introduced in A Great Deliverance, I still find that I don't really care about side characters like Deborah or Lady Helen. Maybe I'm being overly picky, but I'd probably prefer the novel to just focus on the working relationship between Lynley and Havers - especially seeing as there really wasn't much of a presence from Havers in this sequel. Hopefully that's something that is rectified in Well-Schooled in Murder."}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13030645-mo", "userReview": "Good Lord, could a story be any more confusing? \u2022\tDo all of the characters have to be having affairs with each other (either in this book, or as part of their back stories)?\u2022\tDo in-laws really have sex with each other as much as they do in this novel? \u2022\tDo most of these characters have to have 3 or 4 names?

This one was actually one of her bests. The reviews on the back keep comparing George to P. D. James and though I think such a comparison is ludicrous, this Lynley mystery does read like a watered down James novel. The setting and set-up were classic, and the pace moved right along and kept my interest. The problem with this book, as with all George's book in my opinion, is her tendency to descend into cheap, romance fiction. It seems whenever she tries to describe peoples emotions or love relationships we end up squarely in a melodrama.

I was unaware of the BBC series about Inspector Lynley but I was aware of the high average rating (4.0) with more than 10,000 entries.This is a very high-quality entry into the genre of British police procedural murder mysteries. The setup is classic: a locked room mystery of how is an unpleasant author and playwright murdered while attending a weekend dinner party at a remote location in Scotland. Inspector Lynley and his sidekick, DS Barbara Havers, along with forensic specialist Simon St. James are dragooned into taking the case by the upper echelons in Scotland Yard.What George does particularly well is describe the internal emotional worlds of the major characters (Havers and Lynley) as well as the minor but important characters. Then she sets up a bewildering array of familial and romantic connections between the primary suspects. This includes the inclusion of Lady Helen Clyde, Lynsey's longtime unrequited love, in the party of suspects.Towards the end of the book there is an intensely suspenseful chase as the number of suspects gets reduced to one (or maybe 2) and Lynley and Haver set a trap to capture the suspect that goes awry. Misdirection is often an important feature of effective mystery novels and PAYMENT IN BLOOD is no exception to this rule.Overall, the book is probably 4.5 stars but it deserves rounding up to 5 stars for its impressive execution and emotional impact."}, {"userName": "Melissa Joulwan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24528782-melissa-joulwan", "userReview": "This is the second (third?) time I've read this book, and I think it's my favorite Elizabeth George.

This is a 1989 work of art. It seems right to me to call this book elegant. I like this author very much. This is a pretty old series these days. The setting is mostly an English estate house and the whole book has a bit of an old-time feeling to it. And English nobility plays a bit of a role in the book.As mysteries go this one ranked pretty well. It is in the old style of eight or 10 characters snowed in in an old house when the murder takes place. So we know one of the guests is a murderer. By the end of the book more than several of them have seem to be the prime suspect. I never have been one to want to figure out murder mysteries before the end so I enjoyed being manipulated along throughout.

This author was recommended since I love English based mysteries. I am a huge Sherlock Holmes fan. This book had way to many useless characters, who changed their names, going from titles, to pet names, and last names, then first. The idea of a playwright changing her play to tell juicy bits about all those at a country house, was fine, but my heavens did anyone stay in their own beds.? It seems their is no loyalty in friends, or in families, or even brothers, and sisters. It all became a bit of a mash up, and I no longer cared who killed the first person, or the next several. I rarely do this, but I figured out who I thought did it, and checked the end..I was right. I read only two thirds of this book, and since I wanted to shelve it more than read it, I stopped.

This was a classic isolated country manor mystery, with Lynley being called in due to political reasons that are explored and exposed in the book. The references to Christine Keeler and John Profumo were interesting and added to setting by connecting to real life events.Having read a later book in the series first, I can see a big evolution in style for the better from this one. Payment in Blood reads like a outsider\u2019s version of class strife in Britain. The presentation of a very divided society with an entitled and pampered class of titled families was unrealistic from my experience.

For anyone new to the series, I would highly recommend that you read the first book prior to this one or you will miss out on a significantly large part of what makes the book really good!The Good:The emphasis on personal relationships between the main characters is what ultimately makes this book so incredible. When a murder occurs and one of the suspects happens to be a Lord, complications arise. Detective Lynley is put on the case, even though the case itself should not have been assigned to Scotland Yard. Havers, against the wishes of Lynley, becomes his designated partner for the investigation. Upon arriving at the scene, Lynley is taken aback to learn that Lady Helen, a close friend of his, is a possible suspect. Her presence begins to taint all of Lynley's assumptions about the case and narrows his perspective to a fault. I loved the tension in this book. There are so many chasms amongst the main characters that it is entirely possible to get caught up in their personal affairs rather than the murder mystery itself. It was really interesting to see the vulnerable side of Lynley. In addition, the reader learns so much more in regards to the backstories of many characters. Relationships that were briefly touched upon in the first book become much more entangled in this one! Ultimately, the book ends on a cliff-hanger that ensured I will continue on with the series.The Bad:The mystery itself was a bit overwhelming for me. (I seriously considered creating a cheat sheet of characters and their relationships with one another!) With an overabundance of possible suspects, motives, and leads, I sometimes had to take a moment to catch my breath and think things through to keep it all straight. So many threads went in so many directions, that at times the story felt a little overwhelming. With that said, the complexity of the story kept me guessing as to which character ultimately committed the murders and why!The Ugly:The ugly wasn't necessarily a negative aspect. Words were spoken that couldn't be taken back. Actions were taken that had serious consequences for character relations. I couldn't help but wonder what impact these things will have on my feelings towards the next book! I guess I'll have to read it to find out!Overall, I would definitely recommend this to others who like suspense/mystery books with a little nobility thrown in!"}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2176661-sharon", "userReview": "Inspector Thomas Lynley is tasked to investigate a death which is pretty close to his roots, his noble peer roots that is.

The one aspect that would never factor into an Agatha Christie is the detective - Inspector Lynley finding Helen, the woman he loves at the party having it off with another man. And due to their room's close proximity to the room with the body, and his own jealousy Lynley puts the lover, Rhys at the top of the list of suspects. Fortunately for him Haver's is with him, and she's not shy of calling him out on his bias both against Rhys, and for his fellow peer, Lord Stinhurst. To my mind, as with the first novel in this series, solving the crime is secondary to the interaction of the characters of Lynley, St. James, Havers and Helen as they all try to dance around awkwardness of the situation and also try to keep Lynley from making a career ending mistake in how he handles this case. It was a brilliant stroke on E. George's part to have Haver's speak confidentially to St. James about certain things not adding up, rather than come to blows with Lynley which has been her way of handling things in the past. And while at the end of the case, Lynley is berating himself for the mistakes he made in this case, particularly as it relates to Helen, if it hadn't been for his drive to pin the crime on Rhys which made him pursue another angle (which was the true motive behind the murders) perhaps the case might never have been solved at all.

He is Lord Asherton, the eighth Earl of Asherton, to be exact. And his presence is commanded by the upper echelon of the Yard when Stuart Rintoul, Lord Stinhurst, sixteenth or seventeenth Earl of Stinhurst, finds himself at the scene of a murder. Lord Stinhurst is a prominent London producer and has contracted with Joy Sinclair, a renowned true crime writer, to write an original play for his troupe, a group that has been working together for almost 20 years. Script approved, Stinhurst has Sinclair, his main troupe and a media writer assemble at his widowed sister\u2019s estate in Scotland. Accompanying the leading lady is her husband/agent. And Stinhurst has brought his wife and spinster daughter. The director has also brought along a guest, the daughter of yet another earl. To complicate matters, the supporting actress is divorced from the lead actor. And she is also the sister of Joy Sinclair. But the sister and Sinclair are estranged, since Sinclair had an affair with the sister\u2019s husband, that leading actor, precipitating their divorce. On top of all this, Sinclair was the fianc\u00e9e of Stinhurst\u2019s son prior to his death. And let\u2019s not forget the widowed sister, the maid and the handyman. Needless to say, tensions are high in this soap opera.Then Joy Sinclair announces that she has made a few revisions to the script. When the group begins the read-through, they discover very quickly that the \u201crevisions\u201d constitute a full-plot rewrite. Sinclair, with her true crime bent, has altered the original script to expose some very nasty skeletons in the Stinhurst family closet. The read-through devolves into a brawl, after which all parties retreat to parts unknown within the mansion. The next morning Joy Sinclair is found dead, a dirk driven through her neck, skewered to the mattress.Enter Thomas Lynley, ordered to investigate in a jurisdiction in which he has minimal authority and in a jurisdiction that has not officially requested Yard assistance. While this situation confuses Lynley, nothing prepares him for what happens next. Upon arriving at the estate, he finds out that Lady Helen Clyde, one of his closest friends and the woman he has come to love, has spent the night in the room next door to that of the murdered woman, having begged off spending the weekend with him. He then finds out that she is actually spending the weekend with the director of the play, Rhys Davies-Jones.Lynley goes off the rails, betrayed in more ways than one. For the first time in his career, he is determined to force the evidence to fit his needs instead of letting the evidence lead what way it will. And his need is to make that director, that man who slept with Helen, that man whose fingerprints are on one of the keys to Joy Sinclair\u2019s room, the murderer of Joy Sinclair.Elizabeth George has written a mystery that has an entire cast of suspects hating not only the victim but each other. As the sub-plots twist and twine, we are hard pressed to decide just who murdered the woman. But one thing we do know, regardless of the evidence discovered or the theories advanced, is that the director, Rhys Davies-Jones, is not the murderer. He cannot be or the author will have destroyed our main protagonist morally, psychologically and professionally. Lynley simply cannot be allowed to win this fight, not this way. And Barbara Havers, his sergeant, with Simon St. James, are determined to save him from himself, even if they have to lie to him to do it.First published in 1989, with a storyline that occurs in 1988, this book, at the time of this review, exposes us to a 25-year cultural difference. Computers exist in government agencies but only word processors are in private hands. There is no Internet to speed up research nor are there cell phones to ease communication difficulties. And the legal procedures are vastly different than what we experience today. In our current society, no question is too invasive; no privacy is afforded in a murder investigation. But that\u2019s now, not 1989 when this story was written. So when you read Lady Helen\u2019s reactions to Lynley\u2019s very pointed questions at the beginning of the novel, she is not being a drama queen. She is reacting within the cultural norm of her day when women, particularly titled women, were rarely asked about the details of their sex lives in front of witnesses.While the murder mystery itself is both convoluted and masterfully crafted, it is primarily a vehicle for the character growth of Lynley, Havers and Lady Helen. As Lynley and Lady Helen spiral downward into self-recrimination and depression, Havers finds her way upward, past her prejudices and the chip on her shoulder. She becomes the glue and the driving force that saves Lynley from being crushed by the politics of the Yard. And just as Lynley and Lady Helen must choose to face some harsh realities before they can face each other, Havers must choose between her career and her mentor.This paperback edition is 413 pages of small print and tightly spaced lines. That makes it a long read. However, the intellectual and emotional workouts that are fashioned on those pages make it worth the time."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22178705-jackie", "userReview": "I really like Elizabeth George's writing style.

I would've liked more about Havers, like in the first book, but I see why it was focused on Lynley this time."}, {"userName": "Dorothy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy", "userReview": "I recently read the first book in this series, A Great Deliverance, and decided to push on with the second one because I was curious to see how the characters developed. The two main characters, Inspector Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, are opposites in many ways - Lynley, the wealthy aristocrat, and Havers, the working class woman who has had to struggle for everything she has and who has a chip on her shoulder for the privileged aristocracy. One thing they share is a commitment to the truth and to solving crime. They are an interesting contrast. I empathize a great deal with Havers's situation, but I can tolerate Lynley, too, and I enjoy the interaction and the grudging respect that have been forged between the two.This time, the two detectives are dispatched to Scotland to investigate a murder, even though New Scotland Yard really has no legal standing there. The reason for the assignment becomes clear when we learn that a peer-of-the-realm, Lord Stinhurst, is somehow involved in the case and the powers that be in London are anxious to see that he is protected. It is believed that Inspector Thomas Lynley, aka the eighth Earl of Asherton, being an aristocrat himself, is just the chap to handle the assignment. His boss, however, is not entirely on board with the directive from on high to assign Lynley and he sends the antagonistic Havers along to balance things out.In Scotland, they find a theatrical troupe that had been rehearsing a new play which they planned to debut in London later. Their plans are cut short when the author of the play, Joy Sinclair, is brutally murdered in her bed, an 18-inch dirk driven into her neck.Lynley learns to his chagrin that the woman that he loves, Lady Helen, is there with the troupe and that she was occupying the room next to the one where the woman was murdered. Moreover, she was not alone in that room; she was there with one of the actors in the troupe and he was present with her when the murder occurred. Lynley's sexual jealousy leads him to conclude prematurely that this man must be the murderer and his prejudice tends to blind him to any evidence to the contrary.Havers, meanwhile, fixes on the lord as the most likely culprit and her investigation tends to lead her in that direction. As the investigation unfolds, we learn that all the characters seem to be having or have had affairs with each other, including the various brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, etc. It really is rather confusing. One needs a score card just to keep up. Also, various characters are known by different names and/or titles and that only adds to the bafflement of the reader. I found it to be a bit of a muddle, and this was really my only problem with the book. Other than that, I found the plot and subplots to be engaging and the writing quite good. There were several unexpected twists and the relationships were well-developed.I found it interesting that, in the end, the modern murders - there is a second one after the investigators arrive - were found to have their roots well into the past, in a tale of espionage, family honor, and suicide/murder. George did a good job of constructing her puzzle and finally showing us the solution. I really did not have a clue who the murderer was until the end. I continue to be quite enthralled by the character of Barbara Havers and the fact that, against all odds, she has learned to appreciate Thomas Lynley's hard-working and dedicated persona, so different from the public image which many have of him. Likewise, Lynley has learned to appreciate her skills and talent. They make a good team, one that bodes well for future books, of which there are several in this series."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4183997-karen", "userReview": "Astoundingly interesting writing.
