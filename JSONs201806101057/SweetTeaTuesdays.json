This novel by Ashley Farley had all three and I loved it.Three friends had been meeting every Tuesday afternoon for over 25 years to drink sweet tea (a staple of Southern girl talk sessions) and talk about their lives and their problems. Lula was a stay at home Mom who tried to take care of everyone - especially her family; Georgia was the wife of a surgeon who was never home and Midge was a divorcee who was maybe finding love again. Life changes and their long standing social hour had to come to a halt just when they all needed it the most.It is so refreshing to read a book with main characters over 50. It isn't just the 20 and 30 year olds who have life problems. These three women are wonderful and they all have characteristics of people that I know in my Southern life. I laughed with them and cried with them and cheered them on throughout the book. I hope that we see them again in future books by Ashley. This is a fantastic book about the importance of female friendships.I received an early copy of this book from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Alaina Meserole", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50620706-alaina-meserole", "userReview": "I'm really debating if this book should be 3 or 4 stars right now. Maybe a 3.5 if half stars would finally be an option!Sweet Tea Tuesdays is filled with some sweet southern loving fiction. It's a story that dives into love, friendship, and families. For 26 years, Lula, Georgia, and Midge have met for sweet tea and some wild conversations. They are a very loving and supportive group of friends. However, if it's me and my friends change that sweet tea to some wine (or any type of alcohol) and shits and giggles all day every day. However, friendships change and grow throughout the years and these three are no strangers to this situation. Things in their every day lives start to put a strain on their Tuesday gatherings. Of course after a couple of times of this happening to these ladies, they start to actually really need these Tuesday's, sweet tea, and conversations.Again, if it were me.. alcohol. There were things that I liked about this book (like the heartstrings being pulled ever so slightly from time to time) and then there were things that I didn't really understand. I get it, people can be petty at times. However, for some wild ass reason I didn't agree with some of the things these ladies were holding grudges for. Like hot damn, drop it like it's hot, build a bridge, and get the fuck over it already.For example, Georgia having this stupid grudge against Midge for her husbands infidelity!?!? Like why do you care so much about it? Didn't think this was a threesome kind of marriage.Overall, it was an okay, enjoyable, and somewhat emotional kind of book. I mostly picked it up for a challenge task. Then I really liked the cover and the title. I'm still not a fan of sweet tea - but hey, nobody's perfect!"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7209591-heather", "userReview": "This book was not what I was anticipating. I expected a book about friendship. This isn't really about that. The book starts with the friendship of the three women unraveling because one woman gets a job and asks to change their meeting time. That seems like a reasonable request but it causes a major meltdown in Lulu who then refuses to speak to them anymore. We come to find out that Lulu is actually a horrible angry woman who hides it behind a mask of gentility. She is thrilled to find out that her favorite daughter who lives in California is coming back for a visit. We find out that: She went to California for college She doesn't visit She cut her hair shortIt is like the Holy Trinity of Lesbian Foreshadowing. /sarcasmWhen the prodigal daughter tells her mother that she is gay, the mother starts in on homophobic rants that are absolutely vicious. I certainly didn't expect this level of hatred spilling out of a book that appears to be marketed as a light read. People may attempt to explain this character's hatred away by saying that she is sick and not in her right frame of mind. She may not really mean that. I think that is negated by the fact that the older daughter had stayed away for years because she knew her mother would react poorly to finding out that she was a lesbian. She's also racist. When she is imaging that her daughter's friend that is coming home with her is a man, she starts to worry about what will happen if she doesn't like him. In her list of concerns is, \"What if he was a foreigner or a hog farmer?\" Excuse me, what? She also reacts negatively to finding out that the name of the home care nurse she has been recommended is Gladys Guzman. It is ok to have a horrible character in a book. But this book doesn't limit the tone-deaf narrative to that character. There is repeated use of the phrase \"chosen lifestyle\" to describe lesbianism from different characters. Lula's younger daughter has just graduated from college and lives in downtown Charleston. Somehow she also doesn't know anything about gay people? \"She asked herself if she approved of her sister's chosen lifestyle and was surprised her answer was yes.\" Well, thank you for bestowing your seal of approval.She also feels bad about thinking that her mother was bigot. Nope, honey, your mother is a bigot. Go with your gut on this one. Even though towards the end there is magical reconciliation in the family, you don't see if she changes her mind about gay people or \"foreigners\". The people around her don't call her out on it much. If fact they use these phrases to describe her: \"Her faith is so strong.\" \"She was ornery and set in her ways, but she had the kindest heart of them all.\"No. This is a woman who told a doctor who called her out on her homophobia that she didn't want to be treated by any LGBT doctors or nurses. She did not have a kind heart. There are two other women in this story but their narratives took a back seat to Lulu's. They weren't as hateful as she was which is good. I actually liked Georgia who has spent her life as a doctor's wife only to find out that he's been cheating on her for years. She doesn't take his crap (much) when he tries to blame it all on her. Midge is in a new relationship with a man that everyone assures her is rotten. She doesn't listen to her friends or her instincts and yet somehow it is all ok? I've never been a big proponent of trigger warnings but this book might change my mind. The anti-homosexual hatred in this book is so intense and there is no mention of any discussion of homosexuality in the blurb so people would be unaware of it coming. A mention in the description of conflict between a mother and her lesbian daughter might help people not be blindsided."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39134508-kathleen", "userReview": "I always enjoy books written by Ashley Farley. Her stories and characters are realistic and believable and I like her style of writing.

All the more reason to be cremated.\"\"Let this be a lesson for you sweetheart. It's true what they say. Make the most of every minute, and don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today.\"Sweet Tea Tuesdays is set in Charleston and introduces the reader to three fictional ladies who have been meeting for sweet tea at four every Tuesday afternoon since they became next-door neighbours twenty-six years ago. Although they have different personalities and come from different social backgrounds, Georgia, Midge and Lula have supported each other over the years through life's milestones - celebrations and hardships. And then, one Tuesday, Georgia shares news that brings their longstanding social hour to an abrupt halt.Secrets!Will the unraveling of secrets destroy their friendship? their families? their hope?All the characters have likeable traits. Georgia, Midge and Lula and their families seem real to me and when life throws them \"curve balls\", I want to help them get \"home runs.\" I really enjoyed this novel about love, friendship and families and could not stop reading until I finished the book.

It\u2019s eating away the stubborn and selfish part of my brain that makes me act like a shrew.My Review:Sweet Tea Tuesdays was a bit close to home for me; I had a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as several threads in the storyline felt as if Ms. Farley had been hidden behind a wall and secretly collecting data from my childhood. The similarities were rather eerie; although her characters were actually far more considerate and better behaved than the people I share genetic material with. Three vastly different women had forged a friendship while living in neighboring homes for over twenty-six years. Their bond allowed them to overlook each other\u2019s quirks and weaknesses, and revel in their strengths instead. While one was extremely conventional to the point of being an obnoxious bigot and an arrogant and difficult diva, her friends were somehow able to still see her good heart and otherwise kind nature. The women had supported and nurtured each other through child-rearing, infertility, infidelity, divorce, and empty nest syndrome, yet the latest developments were the worst tragedies of all and strained their bond to the point of snapping. For the first time in all those years, the Tuesday Teas were abandoned. The plot was relevant and entertaining, and Ms. Farley\u2019s writing, as always, was poignant, insightful, and emotive. Her descriptive writing easily placed me right along with them as they drank tea, chatted, argued, struggled, and lashed out at each other. I felt the heat of the summer, smelled the flowers in their garden, cringed and felt annoyance at their insensitivities and narrow-mindedness, smiled at their humor, and remained steadfastly engaged in their story throughout, although I was periodically holding my breath for each one of them in turn."}, {"userName": "Susan Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10178397-susan-peterson", "userReview": "Sweet Tea Tuesdays embodies Southern fiction, a tender hearted story of love, friendship and families.

Shallow as it might sound, but I picked up this audiobook because of its pretty cover without expecting much from it. So, it's a bit overstatement to say that I was mildly underwhelmed given the fact I didn't expect much to begin with; this is another Okay read and I am fine with that. That said though, the title and the synopsis came across a bit misleading, at least to me. It was supposedly stressed that Teatime at Tuesdays has been a hard-set tradition for Lula, Georgia, and Midge, the three neighbors and best friends for as long as 26 years. But in my eyes, it didn't seem like that. The said tradition was only briefly mentioned in the beginning, so when Lula got so mad at Georgia attempting to reschedule their teatime, it didn't sit well with me to be honest. The writing style, the multiple POVs narration worked well to allow a deeper glimpse of each character's feelings and thoughts, but I didn't think the characters were well-developed. They seemed a bit two dimensional and flat. In other words, none of the characters -except for Lula's outburst and irrational, bitchy behaviors - left a big impact on me. It is fine that this story depicts ups and downs and twists and turns in their lives, every character has their own issues and concerns, not a single character is all happy in this book. That's realistic. But the approach felt a bit too contrived/convenient at times, like, Lula's sudden recognition and repent for her own behaviors. I knew it would eventually come sooner of later, but it arrived a bit too soon in my eyes. The same goes for Georgia and Midge's reconciliation; I didn't even understand Georgia's grudge for Midge on her husband's infidelity, but Midge explains herself why it took her so long to take action. Could a friendship that lasted as long as 26 years be broken over one incident?? Quite honestly, I felt Georgia's anger was a bit unreasonable.More than anything, I had a big issue with Lula's characterization; it's partially due to the bomb she has (I'm trying not to spoil anything), but even so, her attitudes and words are so disrespectful and flat-out mean to the LGBT community. I was actually put off by it. Despite those issues, I think this book is basically a well-written story of friendship, life, trust and family traditions. Those elements are well-incorporated and intertwined through the solid, consistent writing. It's got some beautiful, moving moments, I felt my tears are pricking my eyes in the last several chapters. My last issue was the ending; it felt a teeny bit rushed. It was undeniably beautiful. But then again, one irrational part of me is asking where the 'Tuesday Teatime tradition' go? A family tradition was beautifully passed down to the next generation, but what about their friendship? It may seem like the ending wrap everything up beautifully without leaving any loose end, but for me, it was a bit underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy listening to this audiobook, but this book didn't move me as much. But obviously, I do intend to pick up some other books from this author. This won't be my last (perhaps)."}, {"userName": "Carrie Schmidt (Reading is My SuperPower)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6084197-carrie-schmidt-reading-is-my-superpower", "userReview": "Ashley Farley is one of my go-to authors for southern fiction. Her words grace the pages with warmth and life, and her stories emphasize the bond of family. I love that her novels focus on older main characters who are living life and all that comes with it. She\u2019s not afraid to tackle tough issues but it\u2019s always done with grace, dignity, and discretion.In Sweet Tea Tuesdays, friendship is explored alongside family and the ways the two worlds intersect. Lula, Georgia, and Midge are in their fifties and have been meeting every Tuesday on Georgia\u2019s front porch for sweet tea and conversation. They consider themselves to be best friends. And then life begins to change for all three of them, and when it comes to a head one summer evening, all the sweet tea in the world can\u2019t make it better.Tough questions are raised on these pages. What do you do when you know something that would shatter a friend\u2019s world? Do you tell her? Or do you keep it to yourself to cause her less pain? What do you do when a friend shuts you out just when they need you most? Do you respect her wishes or do you march back into her life and stand your ground? What do you do when life turns out differently (and shorter) than you planned?Bottom Line: Sweet Tea Tuesdays is warmly written with a drawl of the south and a bouquet of freshly cut hydrangeas set for Sunday brunch. This novel is a bit of a spinoff from the author\u2019s popular Sweeney Sisters series, and I loved seeing Heidi and Annie throughout this story. (It\u2019s not necessary to have read the other series to enjoy this book.) Sweet Tea Tuesdays is simultaneously inspiring and heartwrenching, so make sure you have a tissue box close at hand!

This is a fantastic book that deals with friendships between women and the love between mothers and daughters. A true friend loves you in spite of your faults and is there to prop you up in the worst of times. This friendship isn\u2019t without its flaws but will continue despite them. The love between a mother and daughter is complicated and yet simple. A mother can criticize a daughter but heaven help anyone else who does. A Mother\u2019s love is limitless and true. Ashley Farley does an excellent job of portraying these types of love. Lula, Midge, and Georgia have been friends for over twenty-five years. They have met every Tuesday for tea and talked over their problems and joys. They raised their children together and commiserated with Midge for her inability to have children. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything they could not discuss and solve when they got together. Now, it seems they are going to have to stop their teas as Georgia has taken a full-time job. What will happen to their friendship? Lula is over the moon with happiness. Her daughter Brooke is coming home for the Fourth of July. She begins to plan the perfect Fourth of July party which is reminiscent of those they had been involved in for years. Her daughter, Lizbeth, is a little upset. How can her Mother be so partial to Brooke when she has been home all the time? However, with her job, Lizbeth will get through it. However, Brooke has a surprise for them which may just cut the family in half.

It is set in Charleston during the summer, and Ashley Farley captures summer in the south perfectly.

Lula, Georgia, and Midge have been great friends for many years. They have been together through ups and downs in their marriages, through watching children grow up, and finding their own place in the world with work and life passions. I really liked these three women. The author did a beautiful job at delineating the characters and giving them each a unique voice.

Sweet Tea Tuesdays is set in Charleston, and the streets, shops, and weather could only be written from the perspective of someone who's intimately familiar with that rich locale. The main characters, three women all over 50, are facing life challenges. Each woman undergoes a development arc, something I really look for in a story. They change and grow as a result of the challenges, and in so doing, show us that we can, too. I see more and more books featuring people over 50, and I'm thrilled! I want to read about people my age. How are they dealing with the unique challenges of the second half of life? So in Sweet Tea Tuesdays, I found the maturity of the main characters refreshing. (There are also youthful characters in the book.)The only ding on the story is that I thought it was a bit unrealistic when the three friends became unhappy with each other and took extreme action (I'm trying to avoid spoilers!) considering how long they'd known each other, but I'm grateful to Ms. Farley for writing this book, and I hope to see many more in this age group."}, {"userName": "Susan (The Book Bag)", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1516073-susan-the-book-bag", "userReview": "Ashley Farley is one of my must read authors.

One wants to change the timing of the get togethers because of getting a job, and that's enough to tank the whole weekly tradition altogether.
