I was in Bari, Italy, waiting for the ferry to take me to Corfu, Greece. I was reading a hideously boring Candadian novel, and the young lady in line next to me was reading The Tale of the Body Thief. We switched books. I had never heard of Anne Rice. I fell in love with the book. Soon after, when I was in Sorrento a few weeks later, I was searching for any Rice books I could find. Her writing is lush. Reading this book was like wearing a mink coat inside-out i.e. you feel the soft luxurious fur on your skin. Lestat, the main character, is a very egotistical vampire, yet he is very amicable. The story is very interesting. It is a man hunt. Someone has tricked Lestat into switching bodies, so Lestat becomes a mere human. Lestat and his friend must find the \"body thief\". The action is not abundant and not thrilling. What attracts you to the story and keeps you reading is the language Rice uses and the character of Lestat. I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Gary Galehouse", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1260755-gary-galehouse", "userReview": "She's way too in love with her own writing at this point.

What a serious waste of my time! I felt bad when I was bored with The Queen of the Damned, which I attribute to being Vampire Chronicle-d out, but I can't use that excuse with this book. I had quite a few months between \"Queen of the Damned\" and whatever THIS is.This book has a thread of a good idea - a being who can switch bodies and Lestat who wants to be a human again - and RUINS it with endless talking and thinking about the same points ad nauseum. Scenes that could have been powerful run FAR too long, thus running any good points into the ground.And let me allow a few images to say how I feel about the rest of this series:Full Review:After being mostly OK with his vampire life up to this point (well, after the events of The Queen of the Damned, where he defeats Akasha's uprising, I can see why he'd be a bit bummed), Lestat hears about a Body Thief - a being who can move between bodies and thereby live forever. Louis and David tell him repetitively and in long, clunky chapters that this isn't a good idea. After, of course, long, clunky chapters talking about what God is, who the devil is, and all sorts of religious issues that the author must have been working through at the time.A quarter of a book later, Lestat meets up with the Body Thief. They spend several long, clunky chapters going back and forth on a \"deal\" so that Lestat can use a human body for a week. Lestat hems and haws (and Louis and David chime in again too) before he finally makes the switch, nearly halfway through the book.Lestat then quickly learns that being human isn't all it's cracked up to be. It involves taking a p!ss, eating, being sick, and not being rapey when you want sex. He pretty quickly decides that being human is one of the worst things in the world.When he is sick, he meets up with a nun, who takes him home to care for her - cue long, clunky chapters talking about religion and humanity and vampirity and all topics that could have been interesting if we hadn't spent several long, clunky chapters driving the point home.Once Lestat is better, he rings up David and begs for his help to get his body back. Cue long, clunky chapters talking about everything we've talked about before, squeeze in a brief scene where Lestat gets his body back (and someone else gets a body transplant), and end with long, clunky chapters talking about stuff that really didn't belong in this book.It may be hard to believe, based on my snarky plot summary, but I actually liked Interview With The Vampire and The Vampire Lestat. I thought they were fascinating books, the characters were great, the mythos wonderful. Sure, they are not action! Adventure! Thrills! Chills! every other minute but THAT WAS OKAY.Even when I didn't like The Queen of the Damned, I blamed that on the terrible Mary Sue character, Jessie, and the fact I had read the first three books straight through, which almost always leads to series burnout. So I gave myself a break, to renew my love of this series.And then I listened to this audiobook.Honestly, this could have and should have been a fabulous book. I mean, I still adore Lestat, Louis, David (Lestat and David TOTALLY needed to hook up!), and Gretchen. Even the Body Thief himself was fairly interesting.The problem is, there was too much author intrusion, too much time spent on talking about various topics until their insight and usefulness had died a dismal death and too little time for the story to unfold. I can't tell you how many scenes there were that would start out awesome, with a great new idea, a new concept, a new thought, and then totally destroy it because the characters wouldn't f@#$ing move on.To me, this was particularly apparent when Lestat was with Gretchen. What started out as a beautiful, sensual scene, quickly devolved into monotony and pedantry. Round and round, without end.If only the editor had the sense to cut the book in half! That half would have been the most brilliant, poignant story probably in the entire series!Speaking of series, here comes the biggest question: do I continue?I read series for one of two reasons:+ I enjoy the series+ I enjoy the snarkIt's obvious I'm no longer enjoying the series (and reading what many others have said about later books, I'm unlikely to refind my love of Lestat and company). Unfortunately, unlike with Anita Blake and Ayla, there really isn't anything to snark. It's just BORING.And so, with that said, I'm out."}, {"userName": "Tamcamry", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3366370-tamcamry", "userReview": "\u2022\tI thought that this is by far Anne Rice\u2019s best description of Lestat\u2019s true character. Everything he did in this book was exactly what I would expect someone who is supposed to be so selfish and evil to do. Throughout the rest of the books Rice tries so hard to tell you that Lestat is really not good, that he can do evil things, and she tries desperately to make him into this anti-hero. This is the first book where I think she does a really good job of it. This makes me want to read more about Lestat. In Queen of the Damned, it seemed like she tried to tell a story while telling us all about her vampires\u2019 history. I think that if she would have either done one or the other, the result would have been good, but as it turned out, both the story and the history faltered. This was purely a story.

Los vampiros no nacieron como una explosi\u00f3n de hormonas adolescentes, ni mucho menos del cine (aunque sea este el que nos haya dado las im\u00e1genes m\u00e1s vivas y majestuosas de ellos). Seguramente no muchos estuvieron de acuerdo con el ahora clich\u00e9 del vampiro refinado y elegante que cre\u00f3 Polidori en su c\u00e9lebre relato \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d, que luego pareci\u00f3 afamarse con la obra de Bram Stoker \u201cDr\u00e1cula\u201d, inspirada en parte en la historia del conde Vlad Tepes. Pero juzgar a un lector simplemente porque lee un libro de vampiros es otra cosa.Termin\u00e9 de leer la semana pasada \u201cEl Ladr\u00f3n de Cuerpos\u201d un libro que esper\u00f3 muchos a\u00f1os para llegar a mis manos y que quise devorar desde que, casi de un tir\u00f3n hace un par de a\u00f1os, termin\u00e9 los primeros tres libros de la saga de \u2018Cr\u00f3nicas Vamp\u00edricas\u2019, me atrevo a decir, un cl\u00e1sico de la literatura contempor\u00e1nea escrito por la muy preparada Anne Rice.Me encontraba leyendo las \u00faltimas p\u00e1ginas en un Transmilenio en Bogot\u00e1, cuando una se\u00f1ora que se sent\u00f3 a mi lado no pudo evitar leer la contraportada de mi libro. Entonces, luego de un bufido parecido al de los toros (caballos si se quiere) la se\u00f1ora me suelta: \u201c\u00bfqu\u00e9 pasa que todos leen de vampiros? \u00bfAhora todos quieren ser vampiros? \u00bfse quieren vestir como vampiros? \u00bfUsted tambi\u00e9n quiere dar susto? \u00bfSalir medio desnudo a la calle?\u201d. La se\u00f1ora se baja del transporte y sigue hablando sola\u2026 est\u00e1 bien, me solt\u00f3 todo eso de medio loca, pero \u00bfno han ido demasiado lejos los \u00faltimos escritores sobre vampiros?Si la se\u00f1ora y yo estamos de acuerdo en algo es en esto: los vampiros son hoy un fen\u00f3meno juvenil exagerado, que raya los l\u00edmites de lo sensual para convertirlo en sexy (que no es lo mismo) y que, luego se convierten solamente en moda. No se imagina ella la cantidad de di\u00e1logos existenciales, descripciones fant\u00e1sticas y trivialidades embellecidas que puede encontrar en los libros de Anne Rice, una experta en historia que adem\u00e1s se toma el atrevimiento de crear vampiros \u201celegantemente sensuales\u201d y no \u201cvulgarmente sexys\u201d.Volviendo al libro, una continuaci\u00f3n de la saga que empez\u00f3 en \u201cEntrevista con el vampiro\u201d, contin\u00faa con \u201cLestat el vampiro\u201d y \u201cLa reina de los condenados\u201d hasta llegar al t\u00edtulo que nos compete, lo que inicia como una discusi\u00f3n existencial sobre \u201clo moral\u201d en la vida vamp\u00edrica, nos pasea luego por interesantes teor\u00edas sobre la existencia del bien y del mal, de Dios y el diablo, hasta convertirse en una cacer\u00eda llena de experiencias sin ning\u00fan tab\u00fa sexual ni moral y detalles tan bien descritos que se hacen casi perceptibles.\u00bfVampiros que brillan y salvan adolescentes? No, nada de eso encontrar\u00e1s en los libros de Rice, que explota la figura de Polidori y Stoker desde dentro, creando vampiros m\u00e1s introspectivos, reflexivos y, si se quiere, humanos, conscientes del error, la belleza, el caos y la divinidad, como no es imaginada desde Rimbaud.Una obra muy recomendada para las tardes lluviosas de Bogot\u00e1, y hasta para los domingos asoleados en el parque. Una obra que se queda y no que pasa por moda. Una que debe leerse en presencia de todas las viejitas locas del pa\u00eds."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "3.5 stars.

It is well written and packed of life reflections. There is no doubt that Anne Rice knows what she is doing.Particularly, I just don\u00b4t think that this installment is at the same level as the first three books of this series. To me, this book seems to center more in introspections and rumination than in the actual plot. The storyline feels like an excuse for all the pondering, deliberating and meditating that the characters do. Don\u00b4t get me wrong, it was very interesting, it just didn\u00b4t capture me as much as the others did. This book was definitely more philosophical than emotional. There is less action and more talking and thinking, thus lowering somewhat the entertaining factor.

Unlike all of her other vampire novels, Rice doesn't spend half the book in flashbacks relating someone's history, and for that we are rewarded. More than ever before we are inside the mind of the vampire Lestat and can revel in his fiesty, pompous spirit and feel closer to him than ever before. I remember when reading The Queen of the Damned I was getting sick of the flashbacks and origin stories... I wanted to see Lestat in present day! I wanted to see him covorting around, just being him! And here we get that, we see him in every day existence, absorb the glory of it all, and experience his transitions as he gives up his vampire body to be a mortal once again and his supriring revelations he comes to discover. I didn't want this book to end. When I closed this book, I felt saddened at the silencing of Lestat's running narrative, his eccentricities and sensitivites. But there's at least one more to read, so I still have that to look forward to. But one thing's for certain... out of all the vampire chronicles, this is one I will be returning to and rereading in the future. This book made me realize how incredibly awful it really is to be human. Rice personified it to the extent you feel she really does know what it's like to look from the outside at our species, and it's uncanny how she transforms Lestat's outlook in the process. Yes, this book made me want to live in Lestat's shoes for a day. If I could switch with his body, I think I'd like to stay in there, too."}, {"userName": "Stepheny", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7091879-stepheny", "userReview": "The Tale of the Body Thief is the 4th book in the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice. And it is by far the best one. Lestat is being followed. Everywhere he goes he senses that someone is watching him. He can\u2019t shake it. Finally, his mysterious follower leaves him instructions to meet. Is it a trap? Is he being lured in under false pretenses? Of course, every single person that Lestat talks to instructs him NOT to go.So, being Lestat he goes.The man who Lestat meets offers him a once in a lifetime opportunity- to be mortal again. After centuries of immortality, Lestat could walk in daylight, taste wine and foods, and once again experience life through mortal eyes. Once again everyone tells Lestat not to even entertain the notion.Once again, Lestat does what he wants and goes full-bore into the endeavor. I\u2019ll give it to him, he had a contract, rules, agreements and an arrangement that made sense to both parties. But a man who physically steals bodies? Can he truly be tusted?Of course not. Lestat is forced to be mortal for much longer than he intended. His body has been taken from him and he is now susceptible to the elements. What ensues is nothing short of exciting. The whole book I was on the edge of my seat. I didn\u2019t know whether Lestat would be able to track down the man who had taken possession of his body. Being mortal he no longer has his preternatural abilities. He\u2019s an average human being. Would the other vampires trust that he was in fact Lestat? Would they even help him given the almost nonstop trouble he had caused as a vampire? This book was so revolutionary to me. The idea of an immortal being once again becoming mortal and the manner in which it was done was just so fucking cool. I absolutely loved it.

While the previous Vampire Chronicle, Queen of the Damned features an array of characters and scenarios, there wasn\u2019t as much a focus on the Brat Prince. In this, the fourth book in the series, Anne Rice has almost inverted that: Lestat de Lioncourt is front and center through all of it; the reader gets to, finally, see him fall, and seek redemption. The concept is pretty simple: Lestat, after over two centuries of being a vampire, has grown weary of it all. He\u2019s tired of the purgatory, the repetition; he longs to feel human pleasures again. He comes across a mysterious spirit \u2014 a body thief \u2014 that allows him to trade places with a human man. By combining her trademark erotic and horrific tendencies with a hilarious and enthralling fish-out-of-water scenario (Lestat was human in the 1700s, mind you, and is attempting human life once more in the early 1990s), Anne Rice created a truly addictive read \u2014 perhaps the closest she\u2019s come to a true crime thriller . . . sort of.

I remember being delightfully amazed by this character, the sheer raw sensuality of his persona and of the way he conducted himself. Always wanting everyone to notice him, to fear him, to love him, and actually giving them all the tools required to do so.The torture of immortality is always a floating theme in Rice's books. So is the appreciation of everything thats fragile and beautiful for that, all of the vampires' love for humans and their mortality being a clear example of this. This book, however, takes it a little bit further.It wasn't just Lestat looking at mortals he fell in and out of love in a time lapse of 10 minutes, it was actually him living in man's flesh the fragility of it all. The torment of being an easy to break mortal, of having to actually do something with the short time span you get living. The anguish behind questions so fundamental like what can you do with your life to make it matter, how do you transcend, how to affect the big picture or does this big picture even matter at all.This book actually feels as an outsider looking into what it means to be human, to be fragile. To have human needs and to try and not find them disgusting. To be ever so confused as to what the best approach to this transcendance would be. It continually references parts of Goethe's Faust to keep on elaborating on to the questioning of the impossiblity that there is a god and a devil that actually exist as protrayed to us by religions such as the catholic.The \"action\" part (it's a vampire book after all) did seem to take a bit of low profile role on this one, giving us entire chapters of Lestat in his human form talking to some other human, most notably Gretchen or David, trying to figure it just what it all means.I understand some people that are going around saying it's a slow book. It is, very much so. And a lengthy one, I think it's as long as Queen of the Damned. I would, however, recommend not to let this move you away from this one, but to find the simple beauty of humans interacting that Rice presented us with this book."}, {"userName": "Tokio Myers", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28412182-tokio-myers", "userReview": "\u201cRevenge is the concern of those who are at some point or other beaten.

Raglan is a kickass weirdo of a character (and her descriptions of his movements in the fantastically creepy lead-up to his introduction have stuck with me for half a decade now); she's still obviously a liiiittle bit too obsessively in love with her own Lestat, to the point the brattiness he (and she) takes such pride in gets annoying, but his first (re)impressions of the human world are, like everything Ricean, so expertly crafted and weirdly insightful that I ended up thinking of this book every time I drank orange juice for something like six months.Also, he finally gets to have sex with someone!

I had not read this particular book or had read it so long ago I did not remember it. I actually really enjoyed this one--I found myself up until 6 am last night/this morning finishing it. Lestat is once again our narrator and his attachment to the Talamasca leader David Talbot takes a central role in the story. Lestat meets a former Talamasca member who has the ability to switch bodies and decides to take him up on his offer to switch bodies temporarily to feel what being human is again. The whole lead up to this event was rather like watching a horror movie and yelling at the girl not to open the door--you kind of can't believe Lestat is being so naive. Things do go all pear shaped as one would expect and you have a big chase that is very suspenseful as Lestat attempts to catch up with Raglan James, the body thief. That thread of the story is very interesting and sad and at times exciting but I really enjoyed the exploration of Lestat's feelings for the mortal David Talbot. Anne Rice gets a lot of flack for her flowery language and excessive romance but when it comes down to love, she's really affecting (for me anyway...). I found myself feeling terribly sympathetic towards Lestat as he seems rather like a sweet mooncalf in his adoration of David. It's nice to see our naughty devil a bit flustered for once. This one was a nice surprise--I found myself quite lost in the book in the best way and quite charmed at the new sides of Lestat shown throughout the book.

When the Body Thief (the guy he's traded with) promptly disappears (which, of course he was going to Lestat, you bloody idiot) Lestat finds it more a nightmare than a dream being stuck in such a fragile body and starts a desperate search for the fiend so he can recover his own and wreak revenge.Rice really has a firm grasp on Lestat's voice now and he's never less than entertaining (even while being a complete bastard), but never more so than during his period stuck in the mortal body. His complete wretchedness and fits of near hysteria every time he has to do something simple like walking on a rug (he could fall and smash his head open) or shaving his beard (he's bound to slit his throat), along with his temper tantrums (his arson attack on Louis' home during a fit of pique, and his protests of 'I'm the leader!' during the assembling of his new coven are just a couple of such great moments) had me guffawing loudly.

I did like the previous ones but this one finally sold me on the character of Lestat. To be honest, I wasn't too impressed to see that he'll be the main character of the series as I couldn't connect with him at all in the beginning. It has gotten better since I heard his side of the story but I've become a fan after this book. 'The Tale of the Body Thief' added quite an element to the classic vampire lore for me. At least I haven't read a book about a vampire turning human again yet. You encounter the topic of longing to be human again a lot. There's a certain romanticizing to the human state because of the longing to be 'normal' again. I can relate to Lestat's fascination a lot - thus making it even more interesting to see how this newly acquired state will work out for him. Yes, he's a flawed character. Many turns and twists of the story were easy to spot and more than once you wonder how he could've gotten himself into this mess. I lived the path the story took and although I was disappointed with the ending (just not what I expected) I'm excited for the next book."}, {"userName": "Anna Ligtenberg", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1434502-anna-ligtenberg", "userReview": "ISBN 034538475X - Never having read any of Rice's Vampire Chronicles, I was happy to find that this book does stand alone - no previous knowledge required.Lestat, almost a drama queen in his moments of self-loathing, is approached by a man named Raglan James, who proposes a trade. He will let Lestat be human again, something Lestat believes he wants, by swapping bodies. It is to be a short-term swap, and Lestat overlooks every sign that this could be a bad idea. His friends, human and vampire, warn him against it; James admits to being a liar and a thief... and Lestat takes the risk anyway. How horribly wrong it goes and how it is righted is an interesting story you'll just have to read to discover.There are a few wonderfully well written parts - most happening while Lestat is human. For hilarity, there's Lestat in his borrowed human body dealing with the things he'd forgotten, especially the \"potty\" issues. His repulsion is immeasurable and funny as heck. His short love story with Gretchen, a nun who nurses him back to health, is unexpectedly poignant and touching and their eventual reunion is heartbreaking. Finally, the way Lestat repays David Talbot for his help in reclaiming his own body is nearly perfect, ruined only by David's forgiveness. That, the very end, is the only part of the book I genuinely disliked - if Lestat's big lesson is to be that he loves being the devil that he is, I would have preferred a less happy ending. Still, read it - and when Lestat suggests that you quit reading, perhaps you should.- AnnaLovesBooks"}, {"userName": "Lukas (LukeLaneReads)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10117401-lukas-lukelanereads", "userReview": "Anne Rice goes the 'freaky friday' route and has Lestat switching bodies with a human.

Now, I wonder if I should have stopped reading The Vampire Chronicles then. The Tale of the Body Thief is told by The Vampire Lestat, Rice's famous \"brat prince\". After the events of the last novel the few remaining immortals have disbanded and he now wanders the earth alone, again. He has befriended David Talbot, of the Talamasca, and constantly offers the old man the Dark Gift, which he always refuses. Depressed, lonely, and constantly haunted by visions of Claudia, he attempts suicide in the Gobi Desert.After his failed suicide attempt, Lestat returns to David home and heals. Later he's approached by Raglan James, a mysterious man who has being following him around the world. He offers Lestat an opportunity to be human again. A process which requires them to switch bodies. Lestat becomes convinced that it's the one thing he really wants.Despite the warnings of his friends, Lestat and Raglan come to and agreement to trade bodies for a day. However, Raglan has no intention of returning Lestat's immortal and powerful body, leaving him in a weakened state. After the Louis and Marius both refuse to help Lestat turns to David to reclaim his body.At first, I partially disliked Lestat in Interview with the Vampire. In The Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned, he grew on me. In this book however, there was something about him I couldn't stand.

But The Tale of the Body Thief has nothing to do with those typical stories. I think this book opens a new chapter in The Vampire Chronicles of Anne Rice. Although Lestat is still the Main Character, his path will start to veer towards a more mystical, dreamy, almost religious world. Although for me isn't the best book of Anne Rice, I have to admit that is one of the most entertaining and interesting to read.Spanish version: El Ladr\u00f3n de cuerpos es un libro dif\u00edcil de explicar, cada vez que lo hago parece que estoy contando una mala comedia rom\u00e1ntica de cambio de cuerpos.

It began with Interview with the Vampire, where her \"main\" vampire, Lestat, is introduced, and continued her focus on the various adventures and mishaps of Lestat through this novel, The Tale of the Body Thief.::: Oh, That Silly Lestat. There He Goes Again :::The Tale of the Body Thief begins with the age-old question of the existence of God. Lestat, as usual, begins the narration, and the topic continues as he meets with the Superior General of the Talamasca, David Talbot. The Talamasca is a secret organization who studies all facets of the supernatural, from vampires to telekinesis, and David's friendship with Lestat is frowned upon by the rest of the group. Nevertheless, Talbot describes his own theory of a fallible God and a Devil who actually has the position in shifts with others, no one wanting to be the face of evil.Lestat sees himself as a form of the Devil, becoming evil when his mortality was sacrificed when he was made a vampire. Of course, The Tale of the Body Thief will give Lestat the opportunity to change all that; a man capable of swapping bodies at will offers Lestat the chance to experience a mortal body again. Protests from Talbot and Lestat's vampire compatriot Louis (the protagonist of Interview ignored, Lestat makes the deal with the mortal, Raglan James, and almost immediately realizes that his usual impulsivity has led to what might be the permanent loss of his body. In the mortal body, Lestat is horrified by what he considers to be the foul side of being human again almost immediately, and while in the body, he becomes ill, gets drunk, has sex, and finally turns to Louis for assistance, begging to be remade as a vampire. Louis, of course, refuses, seeing Lestat's folly as a chance for redemption, and Lestat turns instead to Talbot to formulate a plan to regain his own body.::: The Plot Thickens... And Goes Missing :::As much as I love the Vampire Chronicles, I hate Lestat. When they made the movie of Interview with the Vampire with Tom Cruise playing the role, I was doubly annoyed, for a despised actor was playing a despised role. The arrogant, half-cocked antics of Lestat have always annoyed me, even when I loved the books, and The Tale of the Body Thief is no different. Both times I've read the book, I found myself wanting to slap Lestat silly for his stupidity, but without his stupidity there would be no book. None of the other vampires from the Chronicles would be so stupid as to hand over what is one of the most powerful vampiric bodies to a common thief, yet that is exactly what Lestat does, trusting that he won't be duped, even though the reader can see it coming from miles away.Still, the book is an excellent read. The beginning sections with the theories of God and Evil are intriguing, and the mere concept of someone who has has preternatural powers for centuries reverting to the ordinary humanity he has forgotten was a fascinating read, and Rice provides the reader with a very realistic vision of what that might be like.There are only two things that keep the novel from being truly superb. One is the addition of a nun Lestat meets in the hospital when the mortal body falls ill. While this interlude seems to be a vehicle for more discussion of morality, it seems beyond contrived (why would a volunteer nun take an ill man she doesn't know out of the hospital and bring him to her home?) and is just another excuse for Rice to add in one of her requisite number of sex scenes. The other is a feeling that somehow the question of whether or not there is a God got lost in the shuffle. After Talbot's description of \"seeing\" a conversation between God and the Devil in his past, I felt like by the end of the novel there might be some inkling of what this episode was, or some answer other than Lestat's own belief whether it was true. It all seems to rest in his contact with Gretchen, and it falls flat.The Tale of the Body Thief, nonetheless, is an excellent and entertaining read. For once, Lestat gets a bit of comeuppance for his arrogance, although that never seems to slow him down for long. The Tale of the Body Thief is still one of the better books in the Vampire Chronicles series.
