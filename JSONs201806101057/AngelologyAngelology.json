For Trussoni's sad book, my comment is \"Nice cover.\" Fetching, isn't it?However, what a surprise.Not one of my GR friends has any mention of this book - not a review, not a to-be-read, and definitely not a wishlist pick. Gee. I wonder why. Several reasons come to mind. Overall, the book is a half-witted concoction clearly written in the hopes that it would become a movie, or rather the first in a series of movies, given that the book's end signals a sequel. The Nephilim or fallen angels, who live in the midst of a somewhat Victorian-feeling society, apparently elude the notice of most mortals, despite their immense power and influence. Just how this is possible is not explained nor is angelology, which could have been somewhat fascinating, if pursued in any depth.And, just as Maureen Dowd coined the term baldenfreude for men losing their locks, we could probably use the term wingenfreude to describe the loss of wing breadth, luster, and thickness that some of the angels are experiencing. And if the dilemma of Percival, the key male angel, sounds a bit phallic, it should. The description of Percival's former wings in contrast to his mother's flawless appendages is rife with envy and Freudian implications:His mother's wings were gorgeous, shimmering, healthy, full-plumed. A gradation of soft color radiated from the tips, where the feathers were tiny and roseate, and moved to the center of her back, where the feathers grew large and glittering. Percival's wings, when he'd had them, had been even larger than his mother's, sharp and dramatic, the feathers precisely shaped daggers of brilliant, powdery gold.\"Though a major character, Percival, our emasculated and evil angel, is not the main character. That spot is reserved for Sister Evangeline, a remarkably flat and undeveloped character, whose destiny is evident by perhaps page 10 or so of this 458-page book.The only remotely compelling sections were those in Bulgaria, particularly concerning Celestine and Gabrielle. Just why in the hell I read this whole godawful mess can only be explained by major funkdom, when I read continuously (including some awful literature) and eat a lot of bubba-mycin (chicken soup).Please view this review as a public service message. Save yourself from this book and its likely incarnation as a movie (imdb.com indicates that it's in development). aaargh."}, {"userName": "j", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-j", "userReview": "This one kept losing stars as it went. The broad concept was really interesting, excerpting one of those weird bits of the bible and making it the basis for an otherworldly, fantastical story. But the characters are flat and the writing is dull -- most of the first half of the book is scenes of people doing research, and we get to read right along with them as they examine ancient historical texts and first-hand accounts of angelic encounters. This is about as exciting as reading a musty old history textbook can be, but leaves you ready for some action.Sadly, when the action finally does start up, the book quickly falls apart. Danielle Trussoni clearly has zero skill in writing a thriller, and the frantic final third grows increasingly ludicrous and difficult to follow, with several poorly-staged battles between demonic creatures and old nuns and an anticlimactic The Da Vinci Code search for a hidden historical object that is simply there to pad out the story needlessly. The writing is very sloppy and many confrontations don't make much sense (at one point the villain has a gun trained on the heroes but neglects to use it for no discernible reason, even as one of them slowly assembles a mysterious object that might spell the villain's defeat).The ending springs a Star Wars-esque moral choice on the lead character pretty much out of nowhere and the book ends on a very sour note, clearly setting things up for a sequel that I would guess perhaps 10 percent of those who slog all the way through Angelology will actually bother to read.Oh, and it's going to be made into a doubtlessly terrible movie. Hooray."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2240181-kevin", "userReview": "Honestly, if I could give it 3.5 stars, I would. Since I can't, I'm rounding up, as a gesture towards giving the author the benefit of the doubt, expecting that the next book will be better.Angelology is a mixed bag. Personally, I find angel lore, and other mythologies, fascinating, and I thoroughly enjoyed the mix of Judeo-Christian and Greek myth, Talmudic scholarship and discussion of the Book of Enoch (a personal favorite). The subject of the Nephilim has intrigued me since I first read Madeline L'Engle as a kid. So . . . A+ on an interesting new take on very intriguing subject matter.I understand this is the Ms. Trussoni's first novel, her first book being a solidly non-fiction memoir. I believe that this is apparent in her writing style. Frankly, I found the narrative voice to be rather dry for a work of fiction, especially one of the fantastic variety, but perfectly in keeping, however, with the expected tone of a diarist. It is also quite telling that the most compelling part of the book was the section detailing the personal memories of a young woman's life and education in WWII-era France. It was written in the first person, and the character, Celestine, was by far the most well-developed, and most distinctive voice in the entire novel. Clearly Ms. Trussoni is more comfortable, at least at the moment, with this style of narration. The other characters in the book suffered somewhat from a lack of differentiation of voice; they all ran together and \"read\" quite similarly, from evil Nephilim to nuns, to aged angelologists. This was something of an unfortunate impediment when trying to identify with the various characters, and I hope that further work in fiction will help Ms. Trussoni better develop individual character voice.The author is, however, quite skilled in description and her world was very easy to visualize, often vividly so. Unfortunately, her adeptness in this area overbalanced her lesser abilities in characterization and resulted in large sections of the book feeling overly expository, which was surprising, because the book had some truly exciting action bits.Despite the book's flaws, however, Ms. Trussoni really did succeed in drawing me in, particularly after the aforementioned very engaging second section of the book, and left me looking forward to the next novel in the series. She is clearly a skilled and talented author, and I expect that she will quickly develop better fictional narrative skills. While I don't believe the book is quite worth the hype, it is still well worth reading."}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "I am so glad I found this on audiobook at the library. It turned out to be a very good medium for this story. I have to say that for a slow starter, I really got drawn into this book, and when it ended, I had separation anxiety!Two things kept me from giving this a five star rating:1. The slow, meandering start. I was initially thinking, uh-oh, this might turn out to be a real snoozer. Boy was I wrong!2. The ending was a cliffie that really got my blood pressure up! I didn't like the way this novel concluded at all. I hate feeling like I'm being manipulated to read the next book in a series, and it felt that way. I'd rather read a book series that has books that begin and conclude in a natural way. Some resolution, but threads that encourage me to pick up the next book. That was so not the case here. I would have kept reading anyway, but now I feel like my arm is being twisted to read the next book.Things I loved about this book:1. The scholarly tone wouldn't work for everyone, but since I am a bookworm nerd who likes to research topics that are of interest, I could really get into the angelologists and their penchant for delving deeply into subjects in their field. And their subject knowledge.. .Wow! Most of the main characters were in one way or another scholars or people who really knew their stuff. They spent their lives reading and immersing themselves in the past. That spoke to me. 2. I loved the epistolary format, a significant portion of the book written as parts of journal entries and book excerpts. It was executed very well. One would think that this would make the book dry, but it didn\u2019t.3. The narrator was fantastic. She did a gorgeous French accent (and believe me, most of the book is in various French viewpoints), and she made each of the characters sound very different. With the male viewpoints, her voice was lower and conveyed a male speaking. She really brought them to life, and brought a vivid image of the story to life, and I could get an idea of what each character was like based on the way she spoke their parts.4. Ms. Trussoni gets the duality of angels. They are so beautiful they are irresistible, but there are so powerful and dangerous that one never truly forgets (or shouldn\u2019t to their regret) their celestial nature, so far above humans. And then, there are the nephilim. Oh my goodness. They were so evil! I had hopes that creatures of a once divine origin, so beautiful to look at, would have some goodness inside. Not at all! I was continually surprised at how sinister and even corrupt they were. They thought absolutely nothing about humans, or God, or their celestial origins. They were all about obtaining and keeping power on earth.5. Angelology itself as the focus of this book. Who knew? Wow! It\u2019s more than just being an angel scholar. It\u2019s your life, and there is no sacrifice too great, as I learned as I read. It\u2019s all for a purpose, to prepare for the battle against very powerful foes, the nephilim. The people in this avocation that we become acquaintances with in this book suffer so greatly, and as I listened, it was clear why. Their foes were such that it took all their energies to fight them, and losing one\u2019s life could be a given at any time.6. Ms. Trussoni did such a good job of tying all the various narrators together. The story spans over a thousand years (well actually goes back to biblical times), but it all plays a part, and each narrator took my attention and held it hostage as I listened.7. Percival Grigori was a fascinating villain. There were times I felt really sorry for him, and other times I hated him. His highly complicated relationship with Gabriella Levy-French Valco made for some good reading! The societies that the nephilim had built and how they became the ones controlling all the power and money in the modern world felt so plausible, part of me wonders if this is truly possible. It kind of makes sense! Final Thoughts:Although the ending was a buzz kill, I was very impressed overall with this book. The angel parts were surreally intoxicating. I found I cared about the characters, and I was so engaged with their struggles. This book found my angel love and pulled me tight to the narrative. The unreal beauty of the angels, the black hearts of the nephilim, the intense struggle of the frail humans against unimaginably strong (but strangely frail in some ways) celestial creatures. But then, those angelologists have some serious tricks up their sleeve. If you are a reader who loves angels, you should add this to the reading list. Overall rating:  4.5 celestial stars."}, {"userName": "Felicia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia", "userReview": "Well...the cover is FABULOUS.Ok guys, I will admit it: I don't like nuns. I mean, not on a PERSONAL level, but their world view is not compelling in a general fictional sense, and they've always bugged me since one of my first acting classes when I had to play Agnes of God in a scene, and I remember I spilled Coke on myself during the performance and broke character and got yelled at. So this could be my personal problem with one of the main characters that is skewing my opinion. Because she's a nun. To be clear.There was just WEIRD world building in this book. I couldn't grasp onto it, nothing ever felt REAL to me, so it was hard for me to suspend disbelief. I think there was some interesting lore invented here, and some compelling characters, but it was just a bit confusing for my tastes. Probably it was the nun thing. Sally Field was so creepy to me as a kid with that outfit on too, like, she could never get in a sportscar, am I right?!Anyhoo, I think if you like Dan Brown's books this is JUST PERFECT for you.

Angelology is that rare gem.This book has almost every element a great book should offer: multi-faceted, fascinating characters, an exciting, complex, layered plot, and really excellent writing. The story is a tapestry of interwoven storylines, that includes history, religion, philosophy, art, puzzles, and scavenger hunts.The story revolves around Sister Evangeline, a young nun, who has been part of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration convent since the age of twelve, left there by her father after the tragic, and mysterious death of her mother.The Convent has a well-known archive and library with information on Angels. When an art-historian asks permission to visit and access the archives, Sister Evangeline as the nun responsible for correspondence, prepares the usual polite denial. And yet, she is intrigued by the request, which contends that Abigail Rockefellar corresponded with a previous Mother Superior of the convent.Curious, Evangeline searches the archives and finds a letter from Mrs. Rockefellar.This sets off a chain of events which show Evangeline that she is not the person she thought she was, and that her mother and grandmother were keepers of an exceptionally special calling - Angelologists, who have hunted and attempted to exterminate evil rogue angels, called Nephilim, who are living among us to this day.But Evangeline soon realizes that her own life may be in danger because of events set in motion hundreds of years in the past, and that she must discover the truth of her heritage.At the same time, Percival Grigori, son of one of the premier Nephilim families, is suffering from a debilitating crippling disease, that will kill him, unless he can unravel a mystery and obtain a cure, which he believes is being hidden by the Angelologists.It isn't possible to do this book real justice in a review. It has so much to offer you have to read it to appreciate it, and I recommend you do if you like thoughtful, well-written, fascinating historical fiction with a number of psychological thriller twists and turns. Definitely one of the best books I've ever read! This is the author's first book, and I really hope she has more stories like this one in her!!"}, {"userName": "Nikoleta", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13362307-nikoleta", "userReview": "\u03a9\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03b7 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5, \u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, \u03bd\u03b5\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bc, \u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03bc, \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03bd\u03ce\u03c7, \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03ae \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac. \u0397 \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03af \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ac, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5, \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac. \u038c\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2\u2026 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae; \u03a4\u03b9 \u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c0\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c6\u03bb\u03c5\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1; \u039c\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03be\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2, \u03c9 \u03bb\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1!!! \u039c\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1! \u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u2026 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc \u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd, \u03b8\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03b1\u03bd \u03b7 Trussoni \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03c7\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u03af \u03b4\u03c5\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b1!"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen", "userReview": "All 452 pages of it. Yup.I had issues with this book from the first page. The writing is...not good. I know Trussoni went to Iowa (which is usually a yardstick of some kind) and she wrote an acclaimed memoir before this, and this very book is a NY Times Notable Book of 2010. So you'd think she'd write a good sentence. But no. The book is full to bursting with things like: \"Verlaine stared at her, flabbergasted at what this otherwise rational woman had just said.\"and: \"The chaos of people slogging through the slush, the squish of buildings, the incessant movement of traffic in every direction--New York City was deeply familiar, despite her years away.\"The squish of buildings?So, overall the book feels rushed and superficial. It's also about 100 pages too long, in part because there's so much redundant and unimportant information--and long, long passages devoted to careful reiteration of past events and their possible significance. At the same time it's missing major appendages--like believable character development, realistic motivation for a shoe-horned-in romance, thoughtful description of many places people & things...I made myself read to the end of this one because I'm interested in literary writers who turn their hand to genre. Sometimes this can go very well (Michael Chabon, Alden Bell) and sometimes it goes very badly (Justin Cronin, Danielle Trussoni.) I think the secret to writing good genre fiction is not assuming your readers are simple-minded, and not treating it like a cash cow for the movie rights.

Yes, I dare say - Angelology by Danielle Trussoni is the heir to Elizabeth Kostova's The Historian. Angelology is a breathtaking story of ambitious scope: good vs. evil, man vs. fallen angels, Nazis, Greek mythology, the Bible, Milton (Angelology owes much to Paradise Lost). And the heroine is a nun - gotta love it! Sister Evangeline is leading a quiet life of prayer in a convent situated in Milton, New York, when she receives a letter from Paul Verlaine asking for access to the convent's archives. With this one request, Evangeline and Verlaine set off a dangerous chain of events that are connected to the secret society of Angelologists, those who have made it their lives' work to study and defeat humankind's oldest enemy - the fallen angels. The Society of Angelologists go back many generations, claiming as its members, Sir Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon, Milton, of course. They are scholars of theology, scientists, men and women of the cloth who throughout the years have waged a secret war against the Nephilim, the evil offspring of the fallen angels who pass as humans. The darkest periods of human history, such as the Inquisition and the Nazis' rise to power, are attributed to the machinations of the half-human, half-angel Nephilim. However, some of the Nephilim are falling prey to a degenerative disease, and they have become desperate to find a cure. For many years now, the Angelologists and Nephilim alike have been searching for a hidden, fabled treasure from the Archangel Michael himself, which, if the Nephilim were to obtain it would be their instrument to unlimited power on earth and also cure their mysterious wasting disease. Within the forgotten archives of Sister Evangeline's convent lies the key to its location. From Bulgaria, to Paris, to New York - the Angelologists race to find this precious artifact before the Nephilim. Angelology started off slowly, as it opens with details of the uneventful, meditative life of a nun; however, once it hits the Angelology part, it just takes off and soars. Much like Lucifer in Paradise Lost, the Nephilim are mesmerizing figures, more so than the human characters in Angelology. The vivid passages describing them leap off the page.The angelologists examined the body. It was intact, without decay, the skin as smooth and as white as parchment. The lifeless aquamarine eyes gazed heavenward. Pale curls fell against a high forehead and sculptural shoulders, forming a halo of golden hair... It should not have surprised them to find the angel in that preserved condition. The fingernails, nacreous as the inside of an oyster shell; the long, smooth, navel-less stomach; the eerie translucency of the skin---everything about the creature was as they knew it would be, even the positioning of the wings was correct. And yet it was too lovely, too vital for something they had studied only in airless libraries... All their professional lives they had waited to see it. Although not one of them would have admitted so, they secretly suspected to find a monstrous corpse, all bones and fiber shreds, like something unearthed from an archeological dig. Instead there was this: a delicate tapering hand, an aquiline nose, pink lips in a frozen kiss. The angelologists hovered above the body, gazing down in anticipation, as if they expected the creature to blink its eyes and wake.As diabolical and soulless as they are, the fallen angels are seductive; I would love to have majored in Angelology! I love that all the Angelologists have angelic names: Seraphina, Gabriella, Raphael, Celestine, Angela, Evangeline. To give Angelology a scholarly feel, Trussoni weaves Biblical passages, letters, journals, and historic-esque accounts within the fantastical plot (hence the comparison with The Historian). I just could not stop reading this book and raced without break to the thrilling yet unexpected ending. I'm further excited to find out that there's a planned sequel (the ending certainly begs for it) called Angelopolis.

Other Angels put those bad Angels in an easily accessible prison in a cavern under some mountains but don\u2019t worry because for some reason no one can find it even though it\u2019s right outside a well populated town where people have gone for hundreds upon hundreds of years to listen to the Angels singing and lots of people know about it. The bad Angels are totally hidden in their prison. Totally. For sure. There\u2019s also a magical harp down there that everryyybbbooodddyyyy wants. Because it\u2019s a magical harp that\u2019s magical!The resulting children of humans and Angels are called Nephalim and they are the woooorrrsssttttt. They\u2019re super pretty, super rich, and totally, totally evil. No one knows about them except for the thousands of people they employ, work with and hang out with. Oh how are they evil? Examples? Um.Hang on a minute\u2026.No seriously just wait for a second\u2026Okay we don\u2019t have any examples per se but they\u2019re always around whenever bad stuff happens and then they conveniently disappear before they can get caught. It\u2019s all their fault that organized society is like a thing! Before Nephalim we were happy, ignorant, cave people who were totally innocent and then the Angels taught the Nephalim about stuff like reading and making medicine and fire. Totally evil right!? Right!? And and and they are super, SUPER lazy. Like they wait for us to do all the research on the magical harp that is magical and then they STEAL it! Because they\u2019re evil stealers!! Oh and Darwin! Did we mention Darwin!? They totally took his work and messed it up! No we don\u2019t know what it was about before they got it but after it was about evolution! Evolution!? What kind of bullshit is that!? TOTALLY evil right!? And Nazi\u2019s!!! They hung out with Nazis! Super super evil right!? Who likes Nazis!?Okay sorry, we got excited there for a minute, but they\u2019re totally bad news. For serious. But don't tell anyone because its a SECRET!!! SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!But what exactly is Angelology? We\u2019re so glad you asked! Unfortunately we\u2019re never going to give you an answer. What we do primarily is read about angels and have arguments about what we\u2019re reading. Sometimes we say scary sounding things like \u201cthey must be stopped!\u201d We\u2019re going to say a lot of encouraging things to you like \u201calways question the research!\u201d and \u201cno account of an angelogical event is ever totally accurate!\u201d but then we\u2019re going to totally confuse you by insisting you take everything we tell you as the gospel truth! Did someone say gospel!? What a perfect segway! You don\u2019t have to be religious at all to be an Angelologist! We have members from all sorts of backgrounds one of them is even a Buddhist! But you should know that everything written in the Christian bible is the literal truth and everything that happened in it actually happened! Noah's flood? Cornerstone of our ENTIRE belief structure. Yeah, yeah we\u2019re total hypocrites tell us something we don\u2019t know! Hypocrites! Another great segway! So remember when we were all \u201cNephalim are bad, ohhhh they do horrible stuff agghhhhh?\u201d So sometimes we kind of do the exact same stuff. Like lying and manipulation and stealing and murder. We maybe kind of murdered a few people... BUT we do it for the right reasons so it\u2019s okay! Cool? Cool.Do you want to hear about some of our illustrious members? Well, first we have Evangeline Valko. She\u2019s a nun who doesn\u2019t really care about being a nun or God or anything. Her dad put her in a convent after Nephalim killed her mom who was doing important \u201cangel science.\u201d Conveniently this is the same convent were super secret things that the Nephalim would kill to get are hidden! Evangeline\u2019s dad is super smart! Evangeline doesn\u2019t have a frickin\u2019 clue what is going on at any given moment. She's super confused! She\u2019s also technically not an Angelologist and openly questions whether angels are even a thing despite knowing all about her parents\u2019 work and having seen them in person herself. Several times. She\u2019s not remotely compelling because literally all we can tell you about her is; she\u2019s a nun who\u2019s confused!Then there\u2019s Verlaine. He\u2019s a \u201cresearcher\u201d hired by evil Nephalim to do \u201cresearch\u201d into obscure relationships between the Rockefeller\u2019s and the convent Evangeline lives in. He LOVES art and talking about the Rockefellers. Did we mention he\u2019s super into the Rockefellers? Cause he is. Into the Rockefellers. He loooovvveesss the Rockefellers and wants to find some letters they wrote to a nun in Evangeline\u2019s convent. He\u2019s also in love with Evangeline despite the fact that they\u2019ve been in the same room together for all of five minutes total. He\u2019s also not at all compelling because all we can tell you is; he\u2019s a researcher who\u2019s in love with Evangeline!Our favorites though are Celestine and Gabriella who you will learn all about as Celestine (who\u2019s an old nun in Evangeline\u2019s convent now) has an incredibly detailed dream that takes you through a second by second recap of every single solitary moment leading up to the time she went on a mission during World War II to take blood samples from a dead angel and trip over the magical harp that will somehow stop the Nephalim with its magical harpiness. You will be positively riveted by Celestine\u2019s keen observations that her roommate Gabriella is \u201chiding something\u201d based entirely on Gabriella\u2019s facial expressions and style of dress. You will marvel at their \u201cdeep friendship\u201d despite Celestine\u2019s never ending whining about how jealous she is of every single thing about Gabriella, who to be fair is smarter, prettier, and more interesting. You will gasp in awe over the seemingly never ending descriptions of how comfortable the chairs are at Angelology School and how big the bookcases are and how drapey the drapes are! You will fall asleep listening to the narrator doing a really great lilting French accent if you are listening to this in audio format! You will be amazed that anyone let\u2019s Celestine cross the street by herself much less entrusts her with serious world altering information or responsibilities. She is as dumb as a rock.You will try desperately to figure out how Angelology can be so goddamn long and yet have absolutely no story or characters. You will be on page two where nuns are staring intently at the altar in the chapel where they pray constantly and go \u201chuh I bet the secret thing that is hidden is hidden there!\u201d and you will be right because you have an IQ above 4!You will turn bleary eyed to your CD player and shout \u201che\u2019s a fucking angel!\u201d repeatedly while Celestine wonders and wonders and wonders just who Gabriella\u2019s tall, super pale, blond, secret lover is.You will cave in eventually and get the actual book out of the library because if you listen to the narrator any longer you\u2019re going to fall asleep in your car and cause an accident. All of this and more can be yours if you become an Angelologist today!

It combines angels and ancient myths and interweaves them into a contemporary setting. This novel is a struggle between good and evil, between Nephilim (angels of the earth) and Human beings. It is a story of magic, and struggle, and hope. We watch as Evangeline, who grew up in a convent, encounters a world and a life she never knew existed. We are introduced to that world with her, and find ourselves suspending our disbelief as we watch the story unfold. Sister Evangeline is leading a quiet life of prayer in a convent situated in Milton, New York, when she receives a letter from Paul Verlaine asking for access to the convent's archives. With this one request, Evangeline and Verlaine set off a dangerous chain of events that are connected to the secret society of Angelologists, those who have made it their lives' work to study and defeat humankind's oldest enemy -- the fallen angels. The Society of Angelologists go back many generations, claiming as its members, Sir Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon, Milton, of course. They are scholars of theology, scientists, men and women of the cloth who throughout the years have waged a secret war against the Nephilim, the evil offspring of the fallen angels who pass as humans. The darkest periods of human history, such as the Inquisition and the Nazis' rise to power, are attributed to the machinations of the half-human, half-angel Nephilim. However, some of the Nephilim are falling prey to a degenerative disease, and they have become desperate to find a cure. For many years now, the Angelologists and Nephilim alike have been searching for a hidden, fabled treasure from the Archangel Michael himself, which, if the Nephilim were to obtain it would be their instrument to unlimited power on earth and also cure their mysterious wasting disease. Within the forgotten archives of Sister Evangeline's convent lies the key to its location. From Bulgaria, to Paris, to New York -- the Angelologists race to find this precious artifact before the Nephilim. In incredible detail, Trussoni tells a believable tale, a tale that pulls you into the very center of the struggle, one that is 3/4 adventure and 1/4 fantasy. I found myself intrigued as I met the characters and watched the story weave itself together. The story is engaging, fast-paced, and original. The characters are intriguing, believable, and of increasing complexity as the story develops. The settings and time periods range from Paris in the 1940's, to the mountains of Bulgaria, to modern-day New York. Whether in a convent or a cave; whether seeing events through the eyes of a bewildered little girl or a prideful centuries-old Nephilim -- you feel you are there and it feels real.

I mean, it sounded like some funky new age treatise, and secretly, I was worried about what chemicals might be misfiring in her brain. Then she began to describe the plot, and even before she gave me the book, I was hooked.Imagine a world where angels walk beside us, not as mystical guardians but as immortal (or as near to it as makes little difference) preter-natural beings with huge mafia-esque family businesses. Oh, they\u2019re not \u2018out\u2019 or anything \u2013 but they exist nevertheless \u2013 at least in the reality Trussoni has created.Enter Sister Evangeline, orphan, nun, restless soul.

It's Dan Brown with a slightly better editor. The book is split into three sections. The first section was ok. The author did a good job of introducing the families and the specific players. The second section set up the action and gave a history of what the characters were searching for. There were parts of this section that were interesting, specifically the trip to Bulgaria. The third section, was the most similar to a Dan Brown book. It was rushed: new characters were introduced that did not have distinct personalities and other characters were killed off with trite last words.

This book totally left you hanging in the end so that you will find out the rest of the story in the second book.there are so many things that happen in the story but I liked all the characters especially the main ones: Percival Grigoris III - Nephilim/Angel - whos wings were once gold but now black with disease. He contacted a degenerative disorder that had been spreading through their community. Doctors predicted his wings would die spreading the disease to his muscles and he would eventually die.Sneja Grigori - Percivals mother - her wings were the pride of the family - multicolored wings that stretched over 36 ft - they were a symbol of their blood, their breeding, the predominance of their position in the community.Evangeline - Nun - Gabriella's and Percival's granddaughter - Evangeline doesn't find out that she is 1/2 Nephilim until the end of the book.Gabriella - Angelologist - double spy - Percival's loverVerlaine - Dr in Art History - worked for Percival until he found out what he was - fancied Evangeline and realizes he was in love with her at the end.The things that intrigued me were how these angelologist explained how these angels existed:\"We begin in the years before the Great Flood, when heaven dispatched a fleet of two hundred angels called the Watchers to monitor the activities of creation. The Chief Watcher, according to these accounts, was named Semjaza. Samjaza was beautiful and commanding, the very image of angelic bearing.\"\"The angels moved among the children of Adam and Even unseen, living quietly in the shadows, hiding in mountains, taking shelter where humanity would not find them. They traveled from region to region, following the movements of men.\"One afternoon, in the era of Jared, when the Watchers were stationed on Mount Hermon, Semjaza saw a woman bathing in a lake, her brown hair twisting about her. He called the Watchers to the edge of the mountain and together the majestic beings looked upon the woman. According to numerous doctrinal sources, it was then that Semjaza suggested the Watchers choose wives from among the children of men.\"\"The women took these strange creatures as their husbands and soon became pregnant. After some time children were born to the Watchers and their wives. These creatures were called Nephilim.\"These Nephilim were very beautiful, tall, and gifted. The Watchers taught their children many things that were kept hidden from humanity such as secrets of fire - how to kindle and keep it, how to harness it for cooking and energy; metallurgy, the art of working precious metals into bracelets, rings, and necklaces; how to make objects out of gold and gemstones, how to use dyes for cloth, how to color their eyelids with glittering minerals ground into powder, how to melt metal and fashon swords, knives, shields, breastplates, and arrowheads; how to fight, hunt, and store meat. They even taught their daughters how to cast spells and how to use herbs and roots in medicines; taught them the secrets of the magical arts, teaching them a system of symbols to record their spells. they taught them astrology, how tor ead portents in the constellations, knowledge of the clouds, map the course of the sun and the moon, and taught them counter spells.They soon had developed their own tribe and became more powerful over humanity and taking domains of land and claiming their own kingdoms and then they took men/women human on as slaves.\"As the Nephilim ruled over earth and men perished, mankind cried to heaven for help. Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel, the archangels who had observed the Watchers from their first descent to the world, also montored the progress of the Nephilim.\"\"When commanded, the archangels confronted the Watchers, surrounding them in a ring of fire. They disarmed their brothers. Once defeated, teh Watchers were shackled and transported to a remote, unpopulated cavern high in the mountains. At the lip of the abyss, their chains heavy upon them, the Watchers were ordered to descend. Throught a crevice in the earth's crust they fell, plummeting deeper and deeper until they came to rest in a prisness of darkness. From the depths they grieved for air and light and their lost freedom. Separated from heaven and earth, awaiting the day of their release, they prayed for heaven's forgiveness. They called out for their children to save them. God ignored their pleas. The Nephilim did not come.\"\"The angel, Gabriel, messenger of good news, could not abide the Watchers' anguish. In a moment of pity, he threw his lyre to his fallen brothers so that they might diminish their suffering with music. Even as the lyre fell, Gabriel realized his mistake: The lyre's music was seductive and powerful. The lyre could be used to the Watchers' benefit.\"The story just totally amazes me how the children of the Watchers were so selfish. Knowing that god was about to flood the earth and kill all the evil within, the Nephilim searched a way to save their race.If you read Genesis 6 in the KJV bible, it tells the story of why god was going to flood the earth.Genesis Chapter 6:\"1. And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,2. That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.3. And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.4. There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, me of renown.5. And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.6. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.7. And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face fo the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.\"Well we all know that Noah found grace in gods eyes and this part of the story really trips me up and I have to give the writer thumbs up for this part of the story.\"High in the mountains, under a ledge that sheltered them from the rain, the Nephilim stood together, begging guidance from the daughters of Semjaza and the sons of Azazel, whom they considered to be their leaders after the Watchers had been taken below the earth.\"\"For some days Azazel's son and Semjaza's daughter watched the comings and goings of Noah's sons. They were called Shem, Ham, and Japheth, each very different from the others. Shem, the eldest, was dark-haired and green-eyed, with elegant hands and a brilliant way of speaking; ham was darker than Shem, with large brown eyes, great strength, and good sense; japheth had fair skin, blond hair, and blue eyes, the most frail and thin of the three. While Shem and Ham did not tire as they helped their father load animals, satchels of food, and jars of water, Japheth worked slowly. Shem and Ham and Japheth had been long married, adn between them Noah had many grandchildren.\"\"Semjaza's daughter saw that Japheth's appearance was close to their own and decided that this was the brother her companion should take. The Nephilim waited for many days, watching, until Noah had loaded the final animals onto the Ark. The son of Azazel stole to the great boat. Its massive shadow fell upon him, blanketing him in shadow as he called for Japheth.Noah's youngest leaned over the edge of the Ark, his blond curls falling into his eyes. Azazel's son summonded Japheth to accompany him away from the seashore, along a footpath that led deep into a forest. The archangels, who stood guard at the boats prow and hull, inspecting every object that entered and exited the Ark so that it fit God's dictate, paid no attention to Japheth as he left the ship and trailed the luminous stranger into the woods.As japheth followed Azazel's son deeper and deeper into the forest, the man began to fall, pounding the canopy of leaves above his head and echoing loud as thunder. japheth was out of breath when he caught up to the majestic stranger. hardly able to speak, he asked, 'What do you want of me?'Azazel's son did not reply but wrapped his fingers around the neck of Noah's son and squeezed until he felt the brittle bones of the throat colapse. In that moment, even before the Flood wiped out the wicked creatures of the earth, God's plan of a purified world faltered. The future of teh Nephilim race solidified, and the new world came into being.Semjaza's daughter stepped from the forest and placed her hands over the face of Azazel's son. She had memorized the spells her father had taught her. As she touched Azazel's son, his appearance changed\"So now we know that a Nephilim was on the Ark and of course mated with his wife and so now they continue to exist. Japheths children eventually grew up and mated with children from his brothers tribe so now their is a mixture of angel blood in all the populations."}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina", "userReview": "[Evangeline is an angel or half-angel or whatever.

I didn't like all of them. I didn't care if they died or alive. How sad was that? 3: too many gibberish. Seriously, all that explanation, the stories about the past... It was repetitive and confusing because it went round and round as if the author couldn't put the story together. I didn't need all that gibberish words just to grasp what the author want to say. Goodness sake, I wasted my time on this book while it can be written in 250ish pages! 4: the only awesome thing was went the old nun summon a high pure Angel to abolish those half monsters. Awesome scene. But other than that there's no other action scene in it. Everything else just ended blandly. Leave no taste in my mouth. Sad. 5: of course there will be deux ex machina thingy.

And of course they all found it at the same day, like oh there's no need to divide it in different chapters to keep the novel more exciting with mysteries and to build the characters more stronger by it, but no the author didn't do that. She went on and on about the legend and there were pages over pages about \"research\" and how important their job was, how crucial, and how dangerous. The Nephilims are dangerous inhuman creatures that don't have empathy. But they have desire for lust and greed. They're not intelligence creature but they're able to manipulate humans with their beauty and whispers and therefore they're superior and powerful and rich. They work behind powerful human and controlling them. No, there's no magic involved. The book didnt mention how powerful this angels are but their beautiful wings and their super strength.

I have mixed feelings about it. The writer is an \"outside-the-box\" thinker and has a brilliant vocabulary. She created an entire society in this book, fascinating journals and interesting ancient religious artifacts in the story. The story takes place over two days, with a side story of a past event taking up a good chunk of the book. The side story was interesting in and of itself and would have made a good book. The book depticts a world battle between good and evil angels, and their human/angel offspring called \"Nephilim\". This is a dark story with hope, where the dark characters are actually portrayed that way- versus the typical trend in stories that sympathize with dark characters (vampires,magicians).

Le premesse parevano interessanti: nel mondo che conosciamo si combatte da sempre una guerra tra i Nefilim (o Nephilim), i figli degli Angeli, da una parte e gli angelologi dall'altra. I primi vorrebbero la supremazia totale sugli uomini, i secondi vorrebbero cortesemente impedirglielo. Peccato che l'unica cosa interessante di questo libro rimanga proprio questo. La premessa.La storia si divide in tre parti principali. L'inizio ci introduce Evangeline, la protagonista, suora cattolica del convento di St. Rose. Giovane, bella, intelligente, vive in convento da pi\u00f9 di un decennio, da quando il padre ha deciso di rinchiuderla l\u00ec per la sua sicurezza. Ovviamente tutti i migliori piani hanno qualche falla ed \u00e8 cos\u00ec che un giorno le strade di Evangline e di Verlaine, studioso assoldato da Percival Grigori - Nefilim di primo piano, ma questo Verlain non lo sa - si incontrano e portano a galla la relazione tra il convento, tra Gabrielle - la nonna di Evangeline - e suor Celestine, una delle anziane consorelle del St. Rose.La seconda parte ci riporta indietro agli anni '40, dove riviviamo, grazie alle memorie di Celestine, gli avvenimenti di quegli anni che hanno coinvolto la suora, Gabrielle e lo stesso Percival.L'ultima parte, infine, di nuovo ai nostri giorni e dove Evangeline e Verlaine, scoperti i misteri e gli orrori dell'angelologia, si danno insieme a Gabrielle a una fuga e a una ricerca disperata per ritrovare la chiave che potr\u00e0 porre fine al conflitto.Tutto chiaro e lineare, vero? Peccato che l'autrice riesca da questo piano semplice a creare un marasma assoluto. Sono tantissimi i punti che non stanno in piedi e i passaggi logici dove la logica \u00e8 un optional non preventivato..Il primo grande punto interrogativo \u00e8 Perch\u00e9 gli Angelologi si comportano cos\u00ec? Mi spiego. Ci viene illustrato come i Nefilim siano creature che fondamentalmente reagiscono. Non sono capaci di approntare delle loro ricerche, si affidano alle ricerche degli Angelologi per carpire cosa possa essere utile a loro. Questo, per inciso, \u00e8 il motivo per cui non hanno ancora sterminato tutta la categoria, hanno bisogno di qualcuno che pensa al posto loro. Perfetto.Ora gli Angelologi nelle loro ricerche scoprono dell'esistenza di questo oggetto magico, una lira, dai poteri immensi che in mano ai Nefilim potrebbe causare danni irreparabili. Che fanno allora? Beh, ovvio: la vanno a cercare. In pratica forniscono ai Nefilim l'unico modo con cui potrebbero impossessarsene visto che da soli loro non ci penserebbero nemmeno a recuperare tale oggetto. Geniali. Notare che questo si ripete per ben due volte a distanza di 55 anni l'una dall'altra. Come dire, i Nefilim saranno il male assoluto, ma qui qualcuno non ha mai sentito il detto sull'errare \u00e8 umano, perseverare \u00e8 diabolico. E notare anche che della lira gli Angelologi non sanno che farsene, visto che le loro opzioni al riguardo sono: 1) Nasconderla di nuovo2) Distruggerla (ma solo un Nefilim pu\u00f2 farlo. D'oh)Bisogna ammettere che per un libro che fa della ricerca di questa lira il suo punto focale un interrogativo cos\u00ec grande \u00e8 piuttosto destabilizzante, ma proseguiamo..Gli Angeli (i veri angeli caduti intendo) sono radioattivi. Okay. Visto il loro luccicare, questo fa molto centrale nucleare di Springfield, ma okay. Se un uomo li tocca, brucia. Va benissimo. Gli angeli caduti, prima di essere rinchiusi, si sono biblicamente uniti con donne umane (generando cos\u00ec i Nefilim). Solo io ci vedo qualche difficolt\u00e0 tecnica?.Evangeline scopre parte della (sua) storia risolvendo un mini rompicampo. Sua nonna le ha inviato dei biglietti, ogni Natale da quando \u00e8 in convento. Dietro ad ogni biglietto c'\u00e8 un ritaglio di figura. A mo' di tessere di un puzzle, ricompendo la figura originaria alla fine dei 14 biglietti previsti, \u00e8 possibile leggere il testo di una lettera che la nonna ha scritto alla nipote. Nel presente Evangeline ha ricevuto solo 12 tessere. Capisce il trucco, rimette insieme e...1) Il testo che ne consegue \u00e8 completamente comprensibile. Ora immaginate di avere un puzzle con 14 tessere. Ve ne mancano 2, poste a caso all'interno del puzzle, immaginate che su ogni tessera ci sono scritte quella ventina o pi\u00f9 di righe e ditemi se potete leggere un testo completamente comprensibile cos\u00ec! Senza nemmeno accorgervi che manca qualcosa!2) No, alla fine si accorge che manca qualcosa. Perch\u00e9 le informazione non sono complete. Non perch\u00e9 c'\u00e8 qualche decina o pi\u00f9 di frasi lasciate a met\u00e0. SIGH..Le ultime 50 pagine prevedono questa grande fuga, rincorsa, thriller and action movie. Dire che il tutto \u00e8 gestito male \u00e8 un eufemismo. Di nuovo non so nemmeno da dove cominciare per sottolineare l'illogicit\u00e0 di quanto narrato, ma proviamoci.1) I numeri. I \"buoni\" sono 7 persone, non una in pi\u00f9. I \"cattivi\" sono pi\u00f9 di un centinaio, un solo capo e 100 buoi che seguono gli ordini, ma pur sempre un centinaio. Prima cosa, siamo a Manahattan in pieno periodo natalizio e nessuno si accorge di alcunch\u00e9. Poi, utilizzando solo una persona come esca e una come pedina sacrificabile, i \"buoni\" riescono a mettere in sacco i cattivoni di turno. Se non fosse per la decisione di Evangeline di consegnarsi per salvare sua nonna, i nostri potrebbero andarsene senza problemi. 5 - i rimasti - contro 100. 5 umani contro 100 guerrieri addestrati. Okay, capo.2) In ogni action movie che si rispetti, c'\u00e8 la fuga dall'auto. Ferma al semaforo o in corsa poco importa. Ovviamente Angelology non sfugge alla regola. Solo che stavolta a fuggire sono in due: un'arzilla vecchietta di 70 e passa anni e sua nipote. E riescono pure a portarsi dietro il tessssoro. Arsenio Lupin era un dilettante a confronto. E prima o poi qualcuno imparer\u00e0 a inserire la sicura nelle portiere delle auto.3) SONO TUO PADRE. No, non sono proprio queste le parole, ma a senso ci siamo. Ehi, era figo la prima volta in Star Wars. Ora provoca solo una risata sguaiata.4) Vogliamo parlare del finale? No, meglio di no. Tanto finale non \u00e8. Giusto una (emo) porta sul sequel. Non finisce nulla dopo l'ultima pagina di Angelology. E dopo aver arrancato in questo mare di irrazionalit\u00e0 per 500 pagine sa di presa per i fondelli.C'\u00e8 chi ha paragonato Angelology a la Trussoni a Dan Brown. Chiunque l'abbia detto o non ha mai letto Brown o non ha mai letto la Trussoni. Magari nel secondo caso ha saltato le prime 400 pagine (Una. Noia. Mortale.) e vedendo un po' di thriller, action e pseudo teorie religiose ha tirato fuori il paragone pi\u00f9 sballato possibile. La Trussoni non ha nulla di Brown e viceversa. Dove Brown usa una prosa secca, arida ed elementare (ma che ha il vantaggio di velocizzare in maniera esponenziale la narrazione), la Trussoni \u00e8 logorroica e descrittiva all'inverosimile. Nelle prime 400 pagine i dialoghi si contano sulle dita di una mano. Diari, resoconti, pagine di diari, sermoni universitari la fanno da padrone. Il ritmo stagna in maniera dolorosa, l'info-dump abbonda a ogni pagina (perch\u00e9 due studentesse, le pi\u00f9 brillanti della loro et\u00e0, devono risorbirsi le lezioni dell'anno precedente? Perch\u00e9? Io lettore forse ho bisogno di conoscere quelle cose, ma loro o sono stupide o le sanno gi\u00e0. Perch\u00e9?! Perch\u00e9 si sorprendono di fronte a cose che dovrebbero gi\u00e0 sapere? Perch\u00e9? Forse sono stupide davvero, alla fine dei conti. Sigh), avanzare anche di poche pagine \u00e8 una tortura. Rimane quella premessa che ti fa andare avanti, quella convinzione che l'idea di fondo poteva dare avvio a una gran bella storia che ti fa continuare nella speranza, infin disillusa, di trovare un qualcosa di salvabile nelle acque torbide del testo.Ci sarebbe ancora molto da dire, sulla trama e sullo stile e sui personaggi, la cui bidemensionalit\u00e0 e irrealt\u00e0 \u00e8 al di l\u00e0 di ogni immaginazione. Credo di non essere mai stata pi\u00f9 disinteressata del destino di una protagonista. Evangeline \u00e8 un personaggio insulso. Verlain pure. Gabrielle e Celestine, per quanto non esattamente due personcine gradevoli, sono molto pi\u00f9 interessanti, ed \u00e8 un peccato che la loro avventura sia gi\u00e0 finita. Non che importi, per quanto mi riguarda non c'\u00e8 possibilit\u00e0 al mondo che vada avanti a leggere anche il resto di questa saga."}, {"userName": "Mandi Schreiner", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2704703-mandi-schreiner", "userReview": "REVIEWED BY AMANDA Reviewed by AmandaYou may or may not have heard/read/seen the hype surrounding this book. It has already been tipped to be a best seller by the media.Reading the back cover blurb I was really excited to get the chance to read this book before the release date. It sounded like a great read (and that was before I read the hype, by the way I believe the story has already been optioned as a movie.) This is Danielle Trussoni's debut fiction novel, she already has a much acclaimed non-fiction novel under her belt.The story is told mainly by three characters. Evangeline is the main narrator of the story. Evangeline is a 23 year old nun who has lived in the St. Rose convent in upstate New York since the age of 12. The narration is also told from the point of view of Verlaine, an academic whose area of expertise is the Rockefeller family. He has been hired by a wealthy and influential family to conduct investigations on their behalf. The third point of view is Grigori Percivil. Grigori is a Nephilim (an angel) who has hired Verlaine to the answers he seeks. Early on in the story you come to realize that Grigori is sick, it transpires that he has a degenerative condition that is affecting his race and is slowly killing him. Due to this he needs the answers to his questions as soon as possible as time is running out.Verlaine believes that the answers they seek are held in a correspondence he has discovered between the philanthropist Abigail Rockefeller and the late Mother Superior of the Convent, Mother Innocenta of St. Rose Convent. But there are two sides to every story, in this case it is the age old battle of good vs evil, and the information sought has the potential to turn the tide of this battle. If the information falls into the wrong hands it has the ability to change the world as we know it. The Nephilim are the bad guys and the Angelologists have striven for centuries to defeat them, and to keep the world from falling into the servitude of the Nephilim.Unknown to Evangeline, she has a key part to play in this battle. Her mother and grandmother were both Angelologists. The fate of the world lies in her hands.The story is told in a variety of ways, through character narration, letters and journals and going back in time. At first I found the story hard to get into and I initially felt I didn't like it. But as I delved deeper into the story, I was sucked in and was hooked. At times I was a little confused with the story details, although that could have been my fault rather than the story's fault.All in all I enjoyed the book and it is one I would recommend. Although I do feel that it may be a book that while destined to be a bestseller will either be loved or hated depending on each individual reader and will come down to one's own personal preference.I can honestly say that its the first non-romance book that I found myself wanting to put everything else off to read and I didn't want to put it down. I was completely caught up in the story and have told everyone that will listen the bones of the story just enough to get their attention and want to read it as soon as they can!Rating: 3.5/5"}, {"userName": "Yune", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune", "userReview": "There was a lot of buzz about this. I wasn't all that thrilled about the angel aspect or the secret-history-revealed part that seemed to appeal to others, but I gave it a try. What got me to keep reading was that the protagonist works in a library, and that's where she discovers the letter that eventually brings everything into the light. What can I say? But I had to overcome a slow opening where Evangeline (the names were a little heavy-handed) looks at herself in a mirror, and goes through her slow convent life.Things get shaken up: there are Nephilim, the cruel, beautiful children of angels and men, who have been manipulating mortal history (not to the mortals' benefit, and there are angelologists, who try to stop them. There's a powerful artifact hidden away somewhere that both sides race to find, and Evangeline is caught up in this conflict. You know, Dan Brown type stuff.There are a handful of other points of view, and I'm not convinced that they give the story the intended depth instead of just being cumbersome.When I closed the back cover, I was rather meh about it all. Too much gravity to be a quick-paced thriller, too little meaningful exploration of the characters to be anything thoughtful."}, {"userName": "Darshan Elena", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/626990-darshan-elena", "userReview": "So well written, so beautifully researched and documented, so lovely in its narrative scope, Danielle Trussoni's Angelology is a spectacular summer read. This novel is ideal for individuals interested in religious histories, art, and tradition, especially that associated with world Christian faith, and the struggle between good and evil on earth. Most masterful in this book was its historical breadth and nuance: I learned so much even as I was whisked into a world where angels reside and bring about political, cultural, and social strife. In fact, it made me long to revisit the churches I have seen in Germany and Mexico, those architectural gems borne of beauty and despair, not to mention colonialism, genocide, and resistance. A pure delight, Angelology left me feeling somewhat bereft as it came to a close. I look forward to the author's next work, which I imagine will be as stunning and pleasurable as this one. I hope it will have a better name; this one made me cringe for the first hundred pages."}, {"userName": "Heather *Awkward Queen and Unicorn Twin*", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256869-heather-awkward-queen-and-unicorn-twin", "userReview": "I won this book through First Reads. I was never quite clear on where this story was going, and the ending seemed abrupt and to come out of nowhere. I liked it, but I just didn't think it fit with the rest of the book. There were really interesting passages throughout and bits of elegant writing, but I couldn't help but think of The Da Vinci Code (which I never read) and The Historian (which I hated). Fans of those books will surely love Angelology. As for me, I thought the characters were somewhat flat and uninteresting. The angels never frightened me. I never felt any suspense. Perhaps if the book were shorter it would have been more successful for me. It was pretty long for nothing really happening until the last pages."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4600592-susan", "userReview": "I would definitely recommend this book. It read like non-fiction. Like the events were really happening or could happen. Isn't that the goal of any fiction author? To make the story so believable that you find yourself googling names and events? There were times when too many facts and names were thrown out. Times when I found myself skipping ahead to the action, but in the end, all those facts are what made the story so believable."}, {"userName": "Dorsi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2683868-dorsi", "userReview": "I'd actually give this 4 1/2 stars. I really enjoyed this one & it kept my interest throughout. I am surprised this got such low ratings because it was really quite good! I guess everyone has different opinions. There are a few books out there that some people gave high ratings to that I didn't care for at all. A few examples are The Gunslinger, Sharp Objects, The Pagan Stone, & The Time Traveler's Wife. In my opinion, these were terrible! Okay, back to Angelology. I have had this book on my bookshelf for quite some time. I really wasn't looking that forward to reading it. The whole angel, werewolf, vampire, ghost thing is beginning to become a bit worn out. Although I enjoy that genre, it seems like everyone has jumped on the paranormal bandwagon. It seems like some authors are mass producing books as quickly as possible. The new formula is paranormal subject + major sappy romance + total predictability = book sales & good reviews! What the heck! I was leery about reading this book because I was afraid it was going to be like that. That was not the case at all. I found this to be a well written, well researched book! I'm glad I did read it as it was a fascinating read. It was MUCH better written than a lot of popular books out there! It made me pick up my bible a few times! I really liked the characters although Evangeline's character fell a bit flat. I hope Trussoni spices her up a bit in the 2nd installment. I realize that she was a nun however just because you're a nun doesn't mean that you need to be void of personality. I guess Gabrielle had enough personality for them all! LOL The end left me a little discontented.

I so wanted to like this book. Dark angels, Nephilim, secret societies fighting through the ages tied to a modern mystery. But the writing is so heavy-handed and overly florid it's genuine work to soldier on through to the good bits. Not to mention jarring shifts in voice, POV and timelines. Constantly spelling out exactly what a character's thinking or how they're interpreting something isn't good writing. Instead of weaving timelines together the present is simply abandoned for the entire middle section of the book set during WWII told from the first person POV of a nun we just barely met in the beginning. Then it jumps back to the present, robbing that story of any momentum that had been built up. It reads like an MFA student thesis rather than good fiction.I applaud the concept, the story has real potential, but the writing itself bogged everything else down."}, {"userName": "Bern", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4789508-bern", "userReview": "[despite her demise being lamer than choking to death on a cucumber (hide spoiler)]"}], "description": "Abandoned as a Child on the steps of St Rose Convent in New York.
