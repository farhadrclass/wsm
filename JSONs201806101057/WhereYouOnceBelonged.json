They pulled off at the closest exit, which happened to be the town where I grew up. Some volunteer firefighters invited all of the stranded vehicle passengers to a local hall where they were provided blankets, cots, home-cooked meals and cookies. The citizens of this very small town pooled their own resources to provide a sanctuary for 20+ strangers. When I heard this story I was reminded of characters in many of this author\u2019s novels\u2026and I\u2019ve read them all now. He so closely captured their spirit and core values that I felt like I already knew these folks.Where You Once Belonged was first published in 1990, before this author\u2019s award winning trilogy. I\u2019m saddened that it\u2019s my last Kent Haruf novel to read. For some reason, I find it harder to review his novels than books with far less personal resonance. The imaginary town of Holt is located in eastern Colorado\u2026my old \u201chood\u201d until I graduated high school. The author\u2019s use of many colloquial expressions from the area always makes me smile in recognition.I love, love, love this style of writing\u2026stripped down, authentic and lyrical. Kent Haruf was such a gifted storyteller that he could pack a whole chapter\u2019s worth of images and feelings into one sentence. This early novel is poignant, unflinching and confirms his potential as the writer he became with his later Plainsong trilogy. I will miss this author\u2019s fine stories.

Holy crap, could this man write a story! Just a plain and simple read (you think) set in small town USA, and with so few characters. Ha!Pat Arbuckle, newspaper owner/reporter for Holt County narrates the life of BIG Jack Burdette that, at first, I found somewhat amusing, but those feelings did not last long.

Kent Haruf set his novels in the fictional small town of Holt, Colorado. I had only read Plainsong and Our Souls At Night, both lifetime favorites before picking up this one. Kent Haruf died in November 2014. In his final interview Haruf said \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t feel like death is right around the corner,\u201d he said in a final interview on November 24. \u201cBut if it is, it\u2019s a bigger corner than I thought it was.\u201d A unique, reflective voice has gone silent. The Line -  There are so many worthy sentences that I chose to skip the line this time and to quote the opening of the book in this review in hopes of luring you in.The Sinker \u2013 A book that tugs at my being and leaves me in wonder at the power of good writing is often the hardest for me to review. Kent Haruf\u2019s Where You Once Belonged is described as many things, one being terse. The definition of this adjective, \u201csparing in the use of words, abrupt\u201d, might find readers in agreement or debate. At 176 pages, it is short. I read it in one day, but it s certain to stay with me for some time. Since I finished this two days ago, I have come back frequently to contemplate this gem.\u201dIn the end Jack Burdette, came back to Holt after all. None of us expected it anymore. He had been gone for eight years and no one in Holt had heard anything about him in that time. The police themselves had stopped looking for him. They had traced his movements to California, but after he had entered Los Angeles they had lost him and finally they had given up. Thus in the fall of 1985, so far as anyone in Holt knew, Burdette was still there. He was sill in California and we had almost forgotten him.The late on a Saturday afternoon at the beginning of November he appeared in Holt once more.He was driving a red Cadillac now\u201dAs the idiom states\u201dA bad penny always turns up.\u201d and a concise, atmospheric, universal, story unfolds."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "\u201cIt was not a new car\u2026 Nevertheless it was still flashy, the kind of automobile you might expect a Denver pimp or just-made millionaire in Casper, Wyoming, would drive. There was all that red paint \u2013 the color of a raw bruise, say, or the vivid smear of a woman\u2019s lipstick on a Saturday night \u2013 and all of it was shining, gleaming under the sun, looking as though he had spent an entire day polishing it for our benefit.\u201d(The photo is of a 1980 Cadillac Coupe de Ville, which may not be the exact model.)This is a good book (3* isn\u2019t bad), but not in the same league as his exceptional Plainsong and Eventide (see my 5* reviews HERE and HERE, respectively), or his final novel, Our Souls at Night (see my 4* review HERE).Like all his books, it\u2019s set in the small, fictional town of Holt, Colorado, told in spare, believable, slightly cold style. Pat Arbuckle, editor of the town newspaper, tells the story of his classmate Jack Burdette: schoolboy football star admired and indulged by all, turned bad (or rather, undeniably revealed as such), gone, and now returned to an unwelcoming town. But this feels less polished and more formulaic than the other Harufs I\u2019ve read: the key point is stated early on, making some of the questions in the final few chapters less exciting; the ending was predictable and thus unsatisfying; the town I thought I knew felt less real; red is, as usual, almost the only colour mentioned (the Cadillac, and pretty tiles on a university building), but with seemingly less import; there are four(!) grisly and unusual deaths involving vehicles, and two deaths that are not quite deaths.Foreshadowing \u2013 and notThis was the most interesting aspect, and what I enjoyed most. Haruf repeatedly teases the reader with vague hints of bad things to come:* The wife who never showed emotion, \u201cNot even when Toni, our daughter, was sixteen and there was good reason\u201d.* \u201c[It] turned out to be the first in a series of events which ended it for X, although neither she nor anyone else knew it at the time.\u201d* \u201cFive years later Jack disappeared, after something awful.\u201dHowever, later in the book, there is repeatedly a far subtler sense of malevolence lurking in the shadows of sunny days out, with no explicit hints of if or how things will change for the worse \u2013 and they don\u2019t. Until they do.BelongingThe title clearly relates to Jack: whether he still belongs in the town he betrayed. But it applies to many other characters: the independent, aloof outsider who marries into the community, but most especially, to several of the marriages and long-term relationships portrayed in painful detail, whether abusive, distant, or abandoned:* \u201cThat fractious kind of truce that childless couples often accept in place of real marriage.\u201d* \u201cMarriage hadn\u2019t changed him, since marriage was merely a change in his weekend companion.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s college, where everyone wants to belong, but \u201cone of us sank and the other barely made a ripple\u201d.Other Quotes* \u201cSon, you ever figure making anything of yourself?... I\u2019m just curious: when do you plan on starting?\u201d* \u201cYou still think she\u2019s some kind of violin and you just haven\u2019t learned the fingering yet?\u201d* \u201cHer laughter was too loud\u2026 hanging in the air like fog\u201d \u2013 the brave fa\u00e7ade of happiness.* Jack\u2019s charm \u201cwasn\u2019t all conscious and deliberate\u2026 Most of it was a matter of impulse and instinct, the result of native vitality and energy.\u201d* \u201cA house wasn\u2019t alive and capable of bleeding, like a human was. It wasn\u2019t pregnant, like X was\u201d \u2013 so not satisfying recompense for wrongdoing of another."}, {"userName": "Betsy Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5149179-betsy-robinson", "userReview": "Kent Haruf understood people. He wrote about small-town people, but really they are people like everywhere else: proud, arrogant, hurt, angry, frustrated, petty, judgmental. In Where You Once Belonged Haruf displays his perfect pitch for understated truth through behavior and simple dialogue and plot: A bully reappears in the fictional town of Holt, Colorado. Then we learn the history that preceded his disappearing. This is a quietly brutal book, and it is honest. Oh how I love Kent Haruf's writing!***A day later's postscript:I read this book in one day, and after a night's sleep I realize what moves me about not only this novel, but all of Haruf's work that I've read. Before reading Where You Once Belonged, I read a magnificent war story (\nThe Girl in Green\n by Derek Miller) that got to the root of why men fight. Before that I read the Declaration of Independence and Constitution\u2014written by men with men's perspective that referred to Native Americans as \"savages\" and required 76 years to recognize the freedom of African Americans and 133 years for women to be legally represented. Inadvertently I've been choosing my reading to understand what is currently going on in US politics and around the globe, and I've begun to understand that so much of the turmoil may grow out of men's pride and inability to tolerate feeling impotent.Kent Haruf's men not only tolerate it, but they are unashamed\u2014a quality that makes them, for me, transcendently, strong. And attractive. They are full people tolerating their puny human condition. Haruf simply reports it. And this is a stunning achievement for a writer and a man."}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "Holt County, Colorado. A time and place where folks still look you in the eye and pretty much say what's on their mind.

He's a good ol' boy, also a card carrying A#1 asshole. If he expects to be welcomed with open arms, he just may have another think coming. Kent Haruf's lean economy of words will pick you up and plop you right smack dab in the middle of the goings-on in this small town and the people who live here.

A prodigal son returns home. He is not welcome. Why? You do not read to ponder deep questions, but to find out what has happened and how the story will end. The setting is the small fictional town of Holt, situated on the high plains of Colorado. Haruf writes, as always, about small town America. Events culminate in 1985; the book starts there, it backtracks to the 60s and then the 70s and ends again in 1985. Someone is telling us of what has happened. We start and end at the same time and place, but in the beginning we understand nothing, while at the end we understand everything, including who it is that is telling us what has happened and why it is he who is telling us. This is cleverly done. The story is gripping. The tension mounts as one reaches the end.I did guess where the story was leading, but still liked how it ended. The ending could not have been better!That is it. I am not going to tell you anymore, except maybe to say that the tale has a blend of sweet moments, sad moments, episodes that will make you mad and others that will excite; a full spectrum of emotions are elicited. The audiobook narration by Kirby Heyborne is superb. Without question the narration deserves a five star rating. The drama is not overdone; he lets Haruf\u2019s words speak for themselves. He intones the young and the old, women and men, anger and delight and sadness and surprise and uncertainty in a nuanced manner. The tempo varies to fit the events that occur.*************************The Tie That Binds 5 starsOur Souls at Night 4 starsWhere You Once Belonged 4 starsPlainsong 4 starsEventide 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "The prodigal son returns to his hometown of Holt, Colorado to what should have been his day of reckoning.

This novel took a turn I was not expecting and the ending was not one I expected at all.Once again , Haruf with his understanding of small towns and the people who inhabit them, writes a novel that is anything but simple. Using his spare style of prose but an intimate tone by our narrator, a young man who runs the local paper that his father ran before him, he presents this story of a man, who was once his friend, and the havoc this man causes in many lives.

This story took place mainly in the 1970' s and 80's. However the town was as big a character as any one person in the story. Small Colorado town, inhabited by small town people, who were faithful to their town. We meet the farmers, the business owners, and their families. Two young boys in particular, Jack Burdett and Pat Arbuckle are followed from grammar school into adulthood. Burdett became the town bully, Arbuckle just meandered along.

It is less than two hundred pages in length and contains a lifetime\u2019s worth of tragedy and heartbreak, along with some stolen moments of happiness.By reducing his words to the bare minimum and leaving out unnecessary emotive descriptions, Haruf lets the reader determine the level of feeling for themselves simply by witnessing each character\u2019s actions and reactions.

They're all wonderful. And, even though this particular story is just so damn sad, I am still in awe of his use of space and his conservation of words.

I think I described it as sparse back then. The Rocky Mountain News describes it as brooding, pondering style that translates in first-class writing. Don\u2019t think I can improve on that description. What I can\u2019t figure is how pondering and brooding translates into great fiction. But it does. Haruf has a way of telling a story that sometimes appears to be almost elementary, inexperienced, something a beginning writer might write. I guess that is what makes it brilliant. Another literary novel without the pretense of trying too hard to be literary. Haruf comes right at you with his prose. One minute, you will be almost lulled into complacency, then he will hit you with something really gritty and surprising. Again, he limits the number of characters so that we have no trouble keeping them straight. We know who\u2019s who. He also fleshes them out, so that we feel we know them or someone just like them. Just like before, he begins the book with sentences I would not have the nerve to write. \u201cIn the end Jack Burdette came back to Holt after all. None of us expected it anymore. He had been gone for eight years and no one in Holt had heard anything about him in that time.

While it does not have the depth of Haruf's other Holt, Colorado novels, it's an engaging story with a pretty scary villain, and it offers insight into the mindset of folks in that part of our great country."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12182283-cathy", "userReview": "Amazing...read it in one sitting. Mr. Haruf knows how to tell the stories of small town people, their short comings, and their passions and make you care about them."}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene", "userReview": "Where You Once Belonged is another novel (novella really) by one of my favorite authors, Kent Haruf. As is the case with all of Mr. Haruf's books, the story is set in fictional Holt, Colorado.. a beautiful yet harsh landscape inhabited by people who value a hard day's work, enjoy the simple things in life but are always aware that happiness is fleeting. I love Mr. Haruf's plain and minimalist use of language.. it seems appropriate to the citizens of Holt and the quiet lives they lead.This story centers around Holt resident, Jack Burdette. Burdette is a star athlete... a football star. This stardom enables him to get away with pranks and general bad behavior that the typical citizen cannot, Unfortunately, Jack Burdette's behavior, although tolerable as a teen, continues to worsen as an adult until it reaches criminal levels. He truly is a bad character.. without conscience or empathy and there are victims in his wake to prove it.I flew through this novel... hoping all along that Jack Burdette would receive his comeuppance. Sadly, things didn't turn out in this story as I had hoped and this is my only complaint about this novel. The ending left me feeling outraged and wanting justice for these proud, trusting people.. but justice seemed to be ultimately denied. I know that in real life, justice IS sometimes denied .. that is reality;but this ending really left me cold!I love Mr. Haruf's writing but this ending kept me from loving this book! 3.5 disappointed stars."}], "description": "The red Cadillac pulled down Main Street and sat by the tavern for hours, unnoticed. Then Ralph Bird of the Men's Store recognized the driver as Jack Burdette and bolted to the sheriff's office. The prodigal son of Holt, Colorado, had returned--and he was far from welcome.In Where You Once Belonged, acclaimed novelist Kent Haruf tells of a small-town hero who is dealt an enviable hand--and cheats with all of the cards. In prose as lean and supple as a spring switch, Haruf describes a high school football star who wins the heart of the loveliest girl in the county and the admiration of men twice his age. Fun-loving, independent, Burdette engages in the occasional prank. But when he turns into a man, his high jinks turn into crimes--with unspeakable consequences. Now, eight years later, Burdette has returned to commit his greatest trespass of all. And the\u00a0\u00a0people of Holt may not be able to stop him. Deftly plotted, defiantly honest, Where You Once Belonged sings the song of a wounded prairie community in a narrative with the earmarks of a modern American classic.", "title": "Where You Once Belonged", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/843792.Where_You_Once_Belonged", "average": 3.89, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320456139l/843792.jpg", "reviews": 443, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16266.Kent_Haruf", "name": "Kent Haruf"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Contemporary", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/843792.Where_You_Once_Belonged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126861.Where_You_Once_Belonged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19028299-where-you-once-belonged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77156.Plainsong", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23602562-our-souls-at-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89884.Eventide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15762186-benediction", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126862.The_Tie_That_Binds"]}
