This is just one of a dozen or so books that he wrote. His study of the War of 1812 is still one of the premier naval texts.I bought this hardback edition for a few dollars & it was money very well spent. Not only is it nicely put together, but it features engravings by Fredric Remington - excellent drawings of the subject matter.Without some experience with horses, cattle, hunting, & riding out west, I would not have appreciated his capacity for understatement.- It's generally a 'goodly ride' of 40 miles in 5 hours between his north & south ranch houses. (Most people would take twice that time & wouldn't be able to sit a horse for a week.)- Being thrown by the half broken horses wasn't unusual. He picked up a couple of injuries that way. Once a broken rib & another time he broke the point of his shoulder so he couldn't lift his arm up properly. Neither injury was 'serious' nor did they stop him from working, though.Wow. I've spent all day in the saddle on a round up, traveling cross country, & had my share of injuries due to horses dumping me. A broken rib & riding, much less working from a horse, don't go together at all. The man was inhuman.His opinions are stated with a conviction that brook no argument. His identification with & admiration of the cowboys of the area is obvious. Both are clear in this statement, \"...few of the emasculated, milk-and-water moralities admired by the pseudo-philanthropists; but he [the cowboy in general] does possess, to a very high degree, the stern, manly qualities that are invaluable to a nation.\"The last half of the book was about hunting (both men & game) & not as interesting to me as the first part, but it was still very good. He has a keen eye & pen for the habits of game. The descriptions of the scenery & the hardships are wonderful, too. He never whines, but writes the gist of each hunt in a matter-of-fact manner. Staying up for 36 hours straight while bringing in 3 men who had stolen from him a week earlier or slipping from a cliff & falling through a tree while clambering after mountain goats, it's all just a part of the narrative. I had to read closely & stop occasionally just to soak in the stunning revelations.His Wikipedia entry:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore...I think every western author should read this book. It would improve their writing a hundred fold. I recommend everyone else read it, too. He was definitely a man to look up to & it's less than 200 pages. You can't afford not to read this."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9231945-mike", "userReview": "It is good to stretch your reading mind with a bit of more colloquial phraseology. If you like frontier life, hunting, ranching or are from North Dakota/Montana/South Dakota, you will relate to Roosevelt's stories. His description of the people who live between the Rockies and the Missouri River is spot on, even today."}, {"userName": "Donald Rice", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69519139-donald-rice", "userReview": "I was surprised to learn that Theodore Roosevelt was such a marvelous writer of descriptive prose. He has you right there. The scenery, mountains, canyons, bluffs, plains, wildlife, people, are so very well placed on the printed page! I enjoyed the whole book. My favorite parts were his stories about the Indians and also the habits of prong horned antelopes."}, {"userName": "David West", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47184467-david-west", "userReview": "I love this book. This was the perfect book to start reading while on my first visit to South Dakota and Wyoming. What a treat to have a first hand account, from a man whose face is now on Mount Rushmore, of ranching and hunting in the Dakotas. There was a time when the wild west was just that - the wild, wild west. And Roosevelt was there to give us a first hand account. He's a decent writer and chronicles a piece of American history while living it. From stampedes to catching thieves to hunting big horn sheep, this book shows the life of a cowboy in the 1880's."}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay", "userReview": "Got this one at the Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico and for the most part I really enjoyed it. This edition has terrific illustrations by Frederick Remington, a TR contemporary. From this book I got a much clearer sense of a formative part of Roosevelt's life as well as a better understanding of what the West was like some one hundred and twenty years ago, a time when it was still arguably the \"Wild West.\" Roosevelt writes elegantly and admiringly of the people and lifestyle of the Dakota territory, most particularly the cowboys:\"Singly, or in twos or threes, they gallop their wiry little horses down the street, their lithe, supple figures erect or swaying slightly as they sit loosely in the saddle; while their stirrups are so long that their knees are hardly bent, the bridles not taut enough to keep the chains from clanking. They are smaller and less muscular than the wielders of ax and pick; but they are as hardy and self-reliant as any men who ever breathed -- with bronzed, set faces, and keen eyes that look all the world straight in the face without flinching as they flash out from under broad-brimmed hats. Peril and hardship, and years of long toil broken by weeks of brutal dissipation, draw haggard lines across their eager faces, but never dim their reckless eyes nor break their bearing of defiant self-confidence.\" It's clear that TR thinks the American cowboy (save for those occasional lapses in \"brutal dissipation\") to be the embodiment of his ideal of the \"strenuous life.\" He stops short of complete hero-worship, however, and maintains a factual tone when describing the very real dangers and hardships of cowboy life. His own adventures and exploits are related in an endearingly modest way, and he seems almost eager to relate how he falls short of the mark in his four years spent as a rancher. There are glimpses of TR's understated trademark humor as well, such as when describing the local fauna: \"Of skunks, by the way, we had last year altogether too much; there was a perfect plague of them all along the river and they took to trying to get into the huts, with the stupid pertinacity of the species. At every ranch house dozens were killed, we ourselves bagging thirty-three, all slain near the house, and one, to our unspeakable sorrow, in it.\" Which brings me to another aspect of this book: TR's passionate love of the hunt. Now, I have nothing against hunters and for my part only could wish there were more local hunters thinning the local over-abundant deer. Still, it's hard to read accounts of stalking antelope or big-horn sheep when in all my travels out West I've never caught a glimpse of either in the wild, so reduced are their numbers. While TR for the most part only hunted for the meat he needed to sustain himself and his ranch hands, his hunting accounts (which comprise roughly the last third of the book) reminded me of what has been lost -- the vast herds of bison, the massive flocks of passenger pigeons, and all the bounty of the plains, with the most wary of the predators and prey now existing in isolated pockets, their former habitat reduced by the onward march of civilization. And, for the record, fifteen pages describing the habits of the white goat of the high peaks was really more than I cared to read, though I marveled at TR's powers of observation and his enthusiasm for tracking down this elusive creature. I only wished he'd been armed with a camera rather than a rifle.Read this book as a key to understanding both TR's character and an iconic period of the United States. It does an excellent job of shedding light on both."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41672713-carol", "userReview": "This is a really good book, well written & the pictures by Frederic Remington are beautiful! The descriptions of what live, especially hunting, was like a hundred years ago are amazing!"}, {"userName": "Shawn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11753658-shawn", "userReview": "This was well worth the reading for a few reasons. First of all, it captures a bit of a way of life that has mournfully passed on. Roosevelt recounts the hardships and joys of his life as a North Dakota rancher and make you wish that this world could somehow be restored. Even in his time, he saw it fading away. In his accounts he describes the nature of the land, the habits of the wildlife, and the characteristics of the men who lived there in the 1880s. I learned a few things about ranching and the habits of cattle on the life of the cowboy. Somewhere in those Saturday afternoon Western serials you will find some true elements of cowboy life, but Roosevelt's description of their tedious work takes you behind the scenes and unveils some of the wearisome toil that accompanied these rugged men.The book also reveals Teddy's Roosevelt's personal charisma. In the frequent repetition of ideas and sudden subject shifts, you catch a glimpse of his enthusiasm for this life, his pursuit of \"manliness\", and his commanding personality. I can understand how you could walk into a room angry with him, ready to give him a piece of your mind, and walk out arm in arm kicking yourself for forgetting what you were going to say.If you are an outdoorsman with an interest in hunting, you will enjoy the astute observations of the habits of elk, deer, bear, cougars, mountain goats, big horn sheep, grouse, rabbits, foxes, and wolves, as well as his description of hunting methods. If you are an historian, the book is interesting for both the light is sheds on the life of Theodore Roosevelt and on the lifestyle of the inhabitants of the Plains and Mountains in the 1880s. And if you just like to hear a tale told with enthusiasm, this book is has several vignettes that will keep your attention."}, {"userName": "David Platt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19087956-david-platt", "userReview": "Very descriptive account of day to day life on the ranch and the strategies for hunting in the Dakota territories and Montana. TR does not write much about his personal feelings\u2013his book was more about overt experiences and behavior rather than inner thoughts.Roosevelt wrote that cattle from the Old World could not handle the severe winters of the northern U.S.\u2013during one particularly bad winter \"the starving cattle died by scores of thousands.\" Whereas native bison usually survived even the worst blizzards. Modern practices result in most cattle surviving bad winters today, but only because they must be fed stores of grain and given artificial shelter.Some details of how hunted animals died could be somewhat disturbing. I agree with Kay, who wrote in her review: \"I only wished he'd been armed with a camera rather than a rifle.\" TR offered many tactics, meant for game hunters, that a photographer could profit from."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/198165-kathy", "userReview": "I LOVED reading this book. Teddy Roosevelt is a great writer. He had such a full and interesting life as a cowboy in the 1880s and 1890s. And he does a great job of describing everything about people, places, and wildlife in those times. So fun to read a book written in 1896 that describes things in such interesting detail!

This is not something I would usually read, but it was nice to try something new. The beginning of the book was more captivating as it told of TR's rough ranch life. It slowed down a bit in the second half, but still worth the read - if this is your kind of reading."}, {"userName": "Dwight Ternes", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045251-dwight-ternes", "userReview": "Really REALLY enjoyed the first half+, when the subject was the ranching and cowboy life, but found myself efforting to finish the last half or so.
