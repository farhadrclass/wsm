Before this book I was afraid of Polenta. I never knew what to do with it. Now, just seeing some simple ideas had incorporated a whole new grain to my regime. I love the little paragraphs interspersed throughout the book like one entitled \"Fear of Tofu!\" I love the simplicity of this book. It is all in the title.

I tend to let things mold or get old, or taste funny and wonder why like beans. I do check expiration dates if not frozen which can last longer up to 6 months to a year.There's some parts I skimmed through, didn't seem rather important to me like the shopping list with her husband, but could be a cutesy touch for those who have families or mate. Will review recipes to see if there's anything I can try or use. So far, the one that caught my eye is sweet potato soup. (Other recipes weren't appetizing to me then again not necessarily a vegetarian but like to eat vegetarian meals every now and then for cleansing, detoxing, or fasting). Not into cold soups either as some are suggested or offered in the book. Not big on microwaving foods, unless to heat up. I'll see which ones I can use, jot down, and tweak when I try it.Will have to retry soy cheeses but done the vegetarian and soy meat products. Not sure if scallions is a meat substitute but see this used quite frequently in a number of recipes. I viewed this as a meat, seafood, may have to verify since this is mentioned in vegetarian book. I do it with Chinese seafood platters, and pretty good.I saw a recipe to mix greens and black-eye peas together, I love both but prefer to eat them separate on the plate, not sure about making them together in a soup pot.Okay but only copied a few recipes out of the whole book.

I like roasting the eggplants whole!Fruited Couscous: I can't believe I've been using the wrong proportion of liquid to couscous! (It should be 2:1, I was reminded by this recipe.) Anyway, this recipe really uses more than 5 ingredients, unless you buy a 4-oz. bag of \"dried fruit bits\" -- but it was great, nice and fluffy, and it paired well with the baba ghanoush and pita bread.Baked Barbecue Tofu and Peppers: Yum yum! Everyone loved this and it was easy. Onions and peppers pair nicely with BBQ tofu.Simple Potato Salad: Jeff loved this. I thought it was a little simple for my taste, but with the addition of some capers, I loved it.Black-Eyed Peas with Greens: I thought 2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar was a little much, but otherwise this basic saute was delish. I served it with roasted sweet potatoes."}, {"userName": "Gabrielle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5712987-gabrielle", "userReview": "This was one of my favorite cook books when I was just starting out cooking on my own. It was a great guide for a beginner because long lists of ingredients, even spices, scared me away from a potentially delicious dinner. I still use it often for quick week night meals. I like that many of her recipes don't include a milk product, and she pulls in ingredients from all around the world. She also doesn't include very many pre-processed ingredients, which is no small feat for a cook book centered on recipes with only 5 ingredients."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33982-laura", "userReview": "So far the several recipes I've tried from this have been extremely easy, and just different enough. We especially liked the curried lentils and spinach recipe. The recipes can be slightly bland, which in a way is nice because I can choose my own level of spiciness, etc. (and I am a total weenie about spiciness).P.S. I really liked the \"Creamy\" Mushroom Soup recipe. But don't cook it too long! The nice, creamy texture gets clumpy. :("}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/419948-april", "userReview": "This is the best cookbook I have come across in a long time. Normally you have to choose what is most important to you - a vegetarian cookbook with fattening recipes, or a healthy vegetarian cookbook that requires 50,000 ingredients, or a simply healthy cookbook that is not vegetarian? I have FINALLY found one that encompasses all: Vegetarian, healthy, 5 ingredients per recipe.

It's great for vegetarians on tight budgets of both time and money. And while most of these dishes can use a little spicing up, adjustments and substitutions for personal tastes, the basic ingredients are the perfect starting place. One of the advantages of this book is that each recipe lists several side dishes that compliment it.
