The story begins by introducing us to Ellie, who has recently inherited her estranged grandmother\u2019s estate in Charleston, South Carolina. We learn that her mother is deceased, and she didn\u2019t know her father until she was 6. Ellie, escaping from a bad relationship in California, moves into the old house and begins debating on whether she should stay or sell. Over the course of her life, Ellie has tried to remember what happened during the early childhood years she spent with her grandmother and mother. Through therapy, she becomes convinced that something traumatic must have happened to her and that by being in that house again she might be able to conjure her suppressed memories. For decades Ellie\u2019s grandmother had employed Maddie, a housekeeper/servant/you-name-it kind of employee, and when Ellie inherits the house she continues her employment. Because Maddie was a fixture in the house for so long, Ellie is hopeful that Maddie will be able to help her discover what happened to her so many years ago. Maddie is reluctant to help, but with the discovery of her mother\u2019s journals Ellie soon has enough back-story to go on.I thought the premise of the story was great. The idea of having suppressed memories released through the discovery of Ellie\u2019s mother\u2019s past is a captivating plot, so the book engaged me quickly. After Ellie began reading her mother\u2019s journals things got a little sticky for me. It wasn\u2019t entirely clear to me whether we were actually reading her journal entries or if the journals were just a plot device used to get us to Ashton\u2019s life. I would assume the latter if not for one remark in an early Ashton chapter when she said something like, \u201cyou remember when\u2026\u201d which makes me feel like she\u2019s talking to someone. I thought it would have been more effective to have Ellie in the first-person role and for us to read Ashton\u2019s journey in the third-person instead.During Ellie\u2019s search for truth, the author adds in a romantic interest, Julian, which further causes the story to spiral downward. The dialogue between the two is cheesy and clunky, and the speedy onset of their relationship felt entirely implausible to me. Though I did like Julian\u2019s character, I wasn\u2019t impressed with the way the author threw him at Ellie so easily so that they could \u201cmake love\u201d all the time. Additionally, I think the writing here demonstrates that the author is not comfortable writing sexual scenes because anytime the characters had sex it was very much written like this: \u201cThen they made love. She got up to get food and then they made crazy love again. And again.\u201d There are no details, no feelings\u2014nothing that should be included when one decides to make sex a part of a story. I think that it was a mistake to add this extremely intimate relationship so quickly.Aside from the clunky romance subplot, the story was actually decent at this point. I was fascinated by how horrid the grandmother was revealed to be, and I truly thought that the author was going to deliver some crazy plot twists that would impress me. Unfortunately as soon as Ellie makes her final big discovery from the journals, the story is obliterated. Ellie embarks on a quest to find someone she didn\u2019t know existed, that person ends up being awful, and then the story leaves us with our mouths open saying, \u201cWhat?\u201d It felt as though the author was tired of writing, so she took what should have been a large plot development and rushed through it in a couple of short chapters. There is no real resolution. We never truly learn all of what happened to Ellie during her first years. The author has dropped a stop sign on us in the worst possible way. It wasn\u2019t intriguing writing on her part that led her to write this ridiculous ending: It was either laziness or that she ran out of time. The last 30 percent of the book really ruined the entire novel for me, which is a shame since I had expected such good things. In the future, I would hope that the author realizes that she needs to close out her plot points rather than add absurd new ones at the last minute."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39134508-kathleen", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed reading MAGNOLIA NIGHTS by Ashley Farley. It has beautiful descriptive writing and is intriguing and interesting with some creepy parts. Ellie Pringle is surprised to learn that her grandmother has died leaving everything including her antebellum mansion to her. Ellie hasn't seen or heard from her grandmother in over thirty years and remembers very little about her. Abbott, her father, wants her to sell the house, and get on with her life. But Ellie decides to fly from San Francisco to Charleston, stay in the mansion and try to awaken her early childhood memories that years of therapy could not unlock. Will Ellie finally remember why she was traumatized when her father came to Charleston to rescue her? What was so terrible that she has blocked it from memory all these years? Will she be brave enough to stay alone in the spooky mansion? What surprises are in store for Ellie? I highly recommend MAGNOLIA NIGHTS by Ashley Farley. 5 starsSpecial thanks to Kimberly Costa and Ashley Farley for gifting me an ARC of MAGNOLIA NIGHTS enabling me to read it and write my thoughts about the book."}, {"userName": "Sarah Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10380598-sarah-elizabeth", "userReview": "This was a quick, easy read and I enjoyed finding out the family history alongside the protagonist.

Ellie has no memories of her childhood and going back to the house left to her by her estranged grandmother, she finds a journal by her mother. She starts reading....Till this point, I thought that the author, Ashley Farley has done a wonderful job, getting me invested in the story. Then it loses its plot with a love interest and the story loses its steam and goes off track with love making. I liked the story initially then it felt too off-pace. I did finish the book, I did skim the paragraphs, I did skip pages of Julian to get to know about locked memories. I wanted this to be an explosive finish but the reason for the lost memories let me down.

I find myself picturing the grand houses, hearing the charm of the southern voices, and feeling the southern heat. Ashley Farley is amazing with her detailing. The story in this is heart breaking. A woman comes home to her mother after finding herself pregnant and the mother takes her in only to make her a prisoner of her house. When she gives birth, the child becomes a prisoner also. Then the mother dies leaving her house in Charleston to her grandchild. There is so much more to this story but I don\u2019t want to give away too much and ruin your experience of reading Magnolia Nights. There is multiple points of view in alternating labeled chapters. I really enjoyed this format. I liked that you could see other characters perspective on the same events and how it affected their lives. There was no confusion; each chapter was labeled so you knew exactly who was sharing their thoughts. Ashley Farley is a talented author and I recommend picking up your own copy of Magnolia Nights ASAP.

GR really needs to update their rating system either add halves or 1-10. It\u2019s hard to fit these novels in only 1-5. This book is about Ellie who after leaving with her father 34 years ago, comes back to accept her inheritance and try to remember her past. The book was good and interesting but I do feel the person inheriting a house with secret past is a little overdone. But I wasn\u2019t bored in this book.

I loved her Sweeney Sisters series and I was pleasantly surprised by the somewhat eerie, intriguing, and mysterious Magnolia Nights. The storyline was unpredictable and engaging, and it certainly piqued my curiosity and kept me a bit on edge from beginning to end. The tale was well-crafted and full of twists and turns as well as heaving with an eclectic cast of characters that included the endearingly flawed main character of Ellie who is struggling to recover her childhood memories as well as secondary characters who were more than bit eccentric, bizarre, and chillingly devious. The storyline could best be classified as women\u2019s fiction that entails mystery, family drama, romance, suspense, and maybe even a restless spirit if the housekeeper were to be believed. I was quickly pulled into the tale and had a hard time putting my Kindle down. I am eager to see what Ms. Farley does next."}, {"userName": "Melissa Henderson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11644296-melissa-henderson", "userReview": "Captivating from the first page, I could smell the magnolia blossoms, feel the ocean breeze and see the old historical homes in Charleston SC.

Maddie, the housekeeper now as well as for Ellie's grandmother, helps fill in more holes in Ellie's memory.

I started reading it very late one night, or should I say the wee hours of the morning because I was so excited to see what it was about. My eyes only made it one chapter that night but that was enough to know that it was going to be great! I am a big Ashley Farley fan, I've read 6 of her previous books, and have loved them all. But this particular one I think is my favorite. It's a little different than her others, maybe a little deeper. She writes women's fiction but this also has a touch of mystery to it also. The time frame is the present day but it has chapters that take you back about 40 years previous so to help you understand the story. The characters are depicted wonderfully. There are some you will love and some, one in particular, that just frustrated the crap out of me. The setting is in Charleston, South Carolina, and the way the story is written I could almost picture being there. I liked how characters from her other books were brought in or mentioned in the story. It made it feel very community like. Although I did think it ended kind of abruptly and left me wanting more, I believe it was done intentionally. This way, it's left it open to write more and possibly turn it into a series. At least that's what I'm hoping for. I easily give this a 5 star rating and know it will be a book I will want to reread again in the future."}, {"userName": "Anne Rightler", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6047166-anne-rightler", "userReview": "Magnolia Nights, by Ashley Farley, is storytelling at its best. Ellie Pringle's story captivates readers with compelling characters, well-written prose and gorgeous descriptions of scenery--one can almost smell the subtle aroma of the magnolia tree and feel the force of the hurricane winds as they sweep through the Southern city. Ellie has surprisingly inherited her estranged grandmother's fortune and a mansion in Atlanta. Because of the memories of her past, some remembered and mostly repressed, she packs her belongings and moves across country with fear at what she might uncover in the house of her early childhood. Will what she finds break her or bring peace? What memories are there that might be better forgotten? Is there romance in the picture too? Magnolia Nights is a story of family, what it should look like and what it doesn't, a gritty story of secrets, lies and missed opportunities, a story of the beginnings of forgiveness and restoration...a story from a talented author not to be missed.i received a complimentary copy of the book and was not required to write a review.

There is even a little bit of action and mystery - a very well rounded book.This book also reminded me of Flowers in the Attic with the strict grandmother and her actions and comments to her daughter and granddaughter.Ellie has inherited the estate from the crazy grandmother. She has mixed feelings, as anyone would, about the house and everything else. But it is also cathartic because she knows she is repressing something but isn't sure what.

Ellie Pringle has spent endless hours and countless dollars working with a therapist to remember the lost years of her childhood. She\u2019s baffled and more than a little intrigued when the grandmother she hasn\u2019t seen in thirty-four years dies and leaves her a fortune. The time has come to face her past in person. Still reeling from a recent breakup of a long-term relationship, and with nothing to keep her in San Francisco, Ellie packs her meager belongings and boards a plane for the South Carolina Lowcountry.Standing in the entryway of her grandmother\u2019s antebellum home on South Battery Street in Charleston, Ellie faces the first of many ghosts who will soon haunt her. On her first night in the creepy, creaking mansion, as she\u2019s perusing the titles in a dusty bookcase, she comes across her deceased mother\u2019s leather-bound journal. Her mother\u2019s words create more unanswered questions and send her on a quest to find more journals.
