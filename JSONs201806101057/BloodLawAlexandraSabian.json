This would be easier if humans were more accepting of the vamp population, but prejudices and tensions abound. The arrival of her ex-fiance and fellow Enforcer, Varik, with whom she shares a painful past, doesn't make things any easier. Alexandra and Varik have to put aside their differences to find a killer before more lives are lost. There's more to the story, of course, but that's the main premise. People are dying, and it's up to our hero/heroine to save the day. My biggest beef with this book is Alexandra herself. I simply didn't like her. Too much stomping, yelling, and tantrum-throwing for my tastes. Her idea of interrogating someone was to charge into a room and growl/shout, \"Tell me what I want to know, damn it...or else!\". She didn't work well with others, didn't listen to warnings or advice, and consistently threw herself into danger without any thought for the consequences. I'm all for acts of selfless heroism, but she wasn't being selfless - she was selfish, inconsiderate, and at times, just plain stupid. Other elements of the story were bothersome as well. The human/vamp conflict was overdone. I understand this is a small town, but really, do we have to portray EVERY human as small-minded and prejudiced? Even the human officer who started out on Alexandra's side - even she turned on her. Also, I had trouble with the flashback & dream sequences. Just didn't like the way those were handled - like random paragraphs, shoved into the text. And then there was Alexandra's abilities/talents - everything from visions, ghost sightings, psychically reliving a victim's death, even the blood-bond she unwillingly shared with Varik...it just wasn't explained well. Yes, I get that she's packing a cool bag of tricks, but WHY???? Alexandra doesn't seem to have a clue why these things are happening to her, and after reading the book, frankly I don't either. It just DOES, and I guess that's all I'm supposed to know. Long story short, I wouldn't recommend this one."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3909948-amanda", "userReview": "Where do I start? This was not horrible, by let's say, Fallen by Lauren Kate standards, but it wasn't good either. Sure, the storyline was intriguing at times and not devastatingly terrible but I just felt like there were so many things wrong with it that the editor should have caught on to. Blood Law was certainly not a YA book but the writing could have been compared to a YA novel, although content wise, it is more for adults. These were the main problems for me in this novel:1) The author was vastly repetitive with phrases (and I kid you not, she emphasized these phrases so many times that I could pick them out) like, \"University of Louisville\" \"Beethoven's Fifth Symphony\" \"Vanilla and Jasmine\"; and these are just a few. Heck, everyone had a scent to them. Holmes also felt the need to emphasize that the main character Alexandra's ringtone is 'Beethoven's Fifth Symphony' and that Varik's was some techno beat. 2) The storyline was confusing and too ambitious. There were way too many things going on at once and given the fact that none of the characters really stood out to me it became complicated at times. Also, certain \"mysteries\" remained that way, even at the end of the book. It was patchy, and even the world building was monotonous. 3) ALEXANDRA. Good lord, where do I even begin? She is one of the most vapid characters I've ever come across. She is not only reckless and irritatingly stubborn, she is angry and unlikeable 90% of the time. For a member of the FBPI, she sure is useless and does nothing except get injured or shot at. Even her cat has more of a use than her. Only in the last couple of chapters in the book does she magically get somewhat of a fighting power for a good three seconds. Other than that, a major demerit point in a series for me is when I am unable to even like the main character. For the other characters in the book, they were also plain and boring and their voices pretty much was insignificant. The only character that I semi-liked was Varik, who unfortunately has long hair. 4) Let's get things straight- this is a book about vampires. However, the vampires in this world apparently can't do much besides heal a teeny bit faster than humans, have psychic bonds and drink blood. I did not feel any \"supernatural\" element towards them and neither did the story showcase any special elements that they had. To be fair, this is Holmes' first book. I give her props for trying to weave so many plot lines into one story. However, the overall feel I got from the book was that it was influenced by one too many TV shows and it had zero special or unique features to it. If this was a TV show, I wouldn't watch past the pilot. I certainly don't hate the book, but I didn't particularly like it either."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "Summary: As an enforcer for the Federal Bureau of Preternatural Investigations (FBPI), Alex must maintain the uneasy peace between her kind and humans, including Jefferson\u2019s bigoted sheriff, Harvey Manser, who\u2019d be happy to see all vampires banished from town. Then really dead vamps start turning up beheaded, crucified, and defanged. The same gruesome manner in which Alex\u2019s father, Bernard, was in the spring of 1968. They all connect to a cold case that has symied Alex for 5 years.Things get even more complicated when the FBPI sends in some unnervingly sexy backup: Alex\u2019s onetime mentor, lover, and fianc\u00e9, Varik Baudelaire. Still stinging from the betrayal that ended their short-lived engagement, Alex is determined not to give in to the temptation that soon threatens to short-circuit her investigation. But as the vamp body count grows and the public panic level rises, Varik may be Alex\u2019s only hope to stop a relentless killer who\u2019s got his own score to settle and his own bloody past to put right. *I really didn't much care for Varik myself, but what do I know? He's pushy, he's totally arrogant and thinks he's all that and a hamburger helper meal. ::shiver::Review: This is actually a pretty interesting story. You have a writer who is telling the story from all sorts of angles; Alex, Varik, Tasha Blackwood, the liasion between the vamps and humans, Darryl Black the ultimate villian of the story, and Harvey Manser, the sheriff who hates vampires with a passion, but hasn't actually killed anyone. This story is more like a murder mystery novel with vampires as main characters, rather than romance novel. If you have 2-3 pages of would be sex, it doesn't make it a romance novel. Alex, has some serious issues staying out of trouble. She is headstrong and impetuous (her mothers words); she has the ability to see ghosts due to her psychometry ability. She gets shot by a sniper, she touches a dead body and almost dies, she sees her dead father in Shadowland (the place between the physical world and spirit), she gets beaten to a bloody pulp and nearly burned alive with her cat Dweezil (Love the name, seriously!) She runs into her ex-Varik after he is unretired and told to replace Alex and ends up re-establishing their blood-bond after almost dying. Then there is the fact that her own boss, Damian Alberez doesn't trust her, and ends up suspending her after she really goes off the reservation in search of her brother Stephen.I had actually grown to like the character of Tasha, until she really lost her way and strayed into the mists of being an egghead like Darryl Black and Harvey. I can't say I blamed her for acting out like she did when she was pushed aside so rudely by Damian, but, I can't say I want to see anymore of her in the next book either. She really didn't offer anything substantial in the end. She had the culprits right under her very roof, but refused to open her eyes. Nicely done. The story with Alex and her father needs more explaining I think. Sure, he gives her access to the Hall of Records, as it were. But, why did he give up his chance to move on? What in tarnation is he protecting Alex from? Last word: This novel was set in Mississippi. Mississippi has a bad reputation for treating non whites with hatred and malice. Was this the writers intention to say something about the overall about race relations? Or, was this a misnomer and nothing more? Someone interestingly connnected the Human Seperatist Movement with the Fellowship of the Sun in True Blood. Which is interesting to say the least.The next book Blood Secrets releases June 28th 2011"}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2496802-natasha", "userReview": "Blood Law is the first installment in the Alexandra Sabian series by Jeannie Holmes. When I found out we were going to be reading this for the Traveling Book Gnome, I was super excited. I did like the book, but I found myself straying at times. It wasn't because of poor writing, it was written very well. I just think the storyline sometimes dragged on(in my opinion). It is, in fact an original book. I just found something missing... Alex is a vampire who works as an Enforcer for the FBPI (Federal Bureau of Preternatural Investigations) in small town in Mississippi called Jefferson. This world is aware of vampires, but not all loves them. When Vampires are murdered in the area, all in a similar way, and the humans suspicion regarding the vampires get out of control, Alex needs help. Although, the help she get's isn't what she wanted. Alex's Ex, Varik, shows up on the scene with directions to take over her investigation. Making it look like she can't handle the case. As if she didn't have enough to worry about.  I did in fact, love the characters. Alex is a strong heroine. I liked her from the start, and found I liked her even more throughout the book. She cares about the people in her life, and she's a tough enforcer.Varik is my favorite of the book. He's a handsome, protective male with a big heart. I will be reading the rest of the series, mostly for him. One character I couldn't stand was Harvey, Jefferson\u2019s bigoted sheriff. I know he was supposed to come off that way, but ugh, what a guy!  I do recommend this book to urban fantasy lovers. It was a good read, paced with action, suspense and romance. I found something lacking in the book, but I still liked it. It was a good read while camping, and I have a feeling the series will get better with each new book."}, {"userName": "Nora-adrienne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3644378-nora-adrienne", "userReview": "I admit it, I love Vampire novels almost as much as I like cozies. LOL Yes it's a dichotomy. Blood Law is the first book in a new series by Jeannie Holmes. In her world Vampires live, love, and have children, work regular jobs just like everyone else. Granted they are a bit sensitive to light (making sunglasses a necessity) and yes, they are stronger and faster then normals but hey, there's room for all kinds of people as long as it's not your neck being chomped. Alexandra Sabian is a Federal Agent for an agency that watches over the Vampire population and does its best to protect Humankind from criminal vamps. She is stationed in a small Mississippi town where she and the other half of the town (the Vampire half) are accorded a less then cordial welcome. When a spate of murders start showing up it makes life a challenge for Alex. She eventually comes to realize that she is the central character in these events since they all lead to her and her past.

The book though is much darker and has a lot less fluff to it.  There's an over-arcing plot mystery which has a small revelation at the end and which will probably continue over the next few books. The heroine isn't a throughly likeable one but she has some redeeming features to her. Most likely her character will be developed more in the sequels. This was a good book with some faults to it, but the author has introduced some cool elements and there's definitely the over-arcing mystery of what has happened in the past which will continue to be slowly resolved in the future, will definitely be reading the sequel to see what direction the author takes."}, {"userName": "Claudia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10862642-claudia", "userReview": "at the moment I obviously have bad luck with picking up good books or I am tired of urban fantasy. as I can't believe it is the second I have to work on my book pickings.I started this book after reading the first chapter and decided it is worth a try.

Now like humans, vampires need their own policing. This is where Alexandra Sabian comes in. She is an FBPI (Federal Bureau of Preternatural Investigation) agent. She works along with humans to in vampire related murders. But this investigation hits close to home with Alex when the murdered vampires hold a strange resemblance to the way Alex\u2019s father was murdered. It has been about 40 years since his death and his murderer was never found, so Alex is more determined than ever. I really enjoyed this book. The plot was pretty good. It sort of reminded me of the second season of True Blood, just from the cops\u2019 point of view. I love how the story builds up. From the first chapter, it is dark and gruesome. Alex finding out that the man possibly responsible for her father\u2019s death might be in Jefferson, sends her into a world spin. Not only does she have to put up with a town that is split on vampires, including the town sheriff who might know more about the crimes than he is letting on. Alex also must face the reinforcements, her ex-fianc\u00e9e Varik. Things between them ended brutally and he was supposed to be retired, so seeing him is a big shock.  Like plenty of other reviews I have seen, I too couldn\u2019t believe this was Holmes first book. This is just so intricate and layered, I couldn\u2019t believe it. The way she writes almost reminds me of J.R. Ward\u2019s or Adrian Phoenix\u2019s style. We get everyone\u2019s point of view, from the main characters to the villains and those in between. I love that. I like that we can follow what everyone is doing and trying to get an understanding as to why they are doing it.  The characters in the book were all incredible. Alex was a great heroine. She actually reminded me a lot of old Anita Blake. She is tough, takes no bullshit, and she will find her man no matter what while still trying to rescue those close to her. I love Varik, he and Alex may be in a six year patch, but he never gives up on her no matter how piss she is. I love finding books where the characters already have a history, it is rare and it adds more depth to them. Love others characters like Alex\u2019s brother, Stephen, who hates Varik\u2019s guts because of what he did. Then there is Tasha, she is Alex\u2019s partner whose loyalty is really tested in this book. She definitely has some demons to face and Holmes wrote it in a way that she will have an even bigger part in things to come I believe. I truly can\u2019t wait. The only thing I liked and disliked about this book was the actual vampire aspect of the book. Weird, I know, but let me explain myself. I love that the world knows about the vampires and they are fitting in well with society. But in effect, the vampires are quite humanized. I mean, I love they aren\u2019t the dark and cold beings we are used to seeing, but they have powers. Problem is if they use them, they will be punished for it. This couldn\u2019t be truer for Alex who can sometimes see and feel the last few moments of someone\u2019s life (and she can see ghosts). But I think because she has to try and keep her vampire self in check, she can\u2019t do more with them. But I believe that we will see more of her powers in play.  Like I said, this is an amazing debut by Holmes. Again, can\u2019t believe this is the lady\u2019s first book. This was a page turner for me. The twists and surprises will leave you in a state of awe. There are two characters in particular (neither are the actual killer who is very disturbed) who do and hide things that I would not have seen coming. I recommend this even if you aren\u2019t a fan of Urban Fantasy. It is still a great Thriller."}, {"userName": "Kerry", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/382536-kerry", "userReview": "I discovered Jeannie Holmes through a couple of degrees of social networking (and it\u2019s gone a step further as Mel tells me she\u2019s ordered a copy for her mother after reading my first post).Hooray for social media then, because I\u2019ve found a great new author to follow. And, even better, there are only two books out so far, so I don\u2019t have too much catching up to do. Instead, I get to look forward to more books in a new world without worrying about a huge backlog. (For example, I sure wouldn\u2019t want to be starting J. D. Robb\u2019s Eve Dallas series now, without 40-odd stories published already.)There\u2019s a nice new take on vampires in Ms Holmes\u2019 book \u2013 they\u2019re a different species rather than something into which humans can be turned, they\u2019re not all powerful even if they are stronger than humans and it\u2019s relatively easy for one to \u201cpass\u201d as human. There is a real thread of anti-vampire hatred in the book that surprised me as I wasn\u2019t expecting it. True, this is also seen in other vampire books, but it had a depth and reality here that really made me quite uncomfortable. I guess it was a good kind of uncomfortable, since it came from high quality world building, which meant I could easily believe in it. There\u2019s not going to be any easy peace between humans and vamps here and the hostility was painful to read. One thought that went though my head was that the \u201ccoming out\u201d of the vampires must have done great things for race relations in this world as now there were non-humans to aim all that hatred and vitriol at.The characters are well developed and I look forward to learning more about them in future books. I suspect there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about Alex yet (or about Varik for that matter), and I can\u2019t decide if her bad judgement as shown in this book was endearing or frustrating. She did some dumb things, but I think they came more from her personality than from any required plot stupidity. At the end, she knew she was doing something dumb, she recognised there would be serious consequences, but she did it anyway. And if it was me, I can\u2019t say that I\u2019d have done differently (assuming I was a strong and confident vampire and not the weak and wimpy human I actually am). As a spectator I can see what she \u201cshould\u201d have done, but I\u2019m not sure that the character as introduced to us would have done that. So I guess my feeling is that yes, I was convinced by Alex. She will be facing those consequences in the next book and I look forward to seeing how she does.I really rather do like Varik too. While I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not, he was portrayed as a simpler character in this book, but going on the blurb, I rather suspect his turn will come next time. He had aspects of the standard handsome, alpha vamp, but there\u2019s a feeling of a lot more under the surface as well. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing it.Despite the presence of vampires, I was expecting something along the lines of a police procedural \u2013 I\u2019m not quite sure why \u2013 so the supernatural element (beyond vampires) that showed up rather surprised me. I wasn\u2019t sure I liked it at first, but now I\u2019ve finished I can\u2019t wait to learn more.Hooray for Google+ and Dave\u2019s work connections, because I\u2019ve found a good author here and I\u2019m looking forward to more good stories from her. There are just so many paranormal books out there these days that they all start to look the same. I\u2019m generally not going to give something a try without a good reason.

In steps resident Enforcer Alex Sabian and FBPI to deal with a local Sheriff who hates vamps and the killer who seems to have his sites aimed squarely at Alex.

Will we find out who the killer is? By the time we do will we still care?Blood Law is a decent book, not great, not terrible. The story itself is pretty solid, if a bit overdone. The characters were about what I expected them to be, nothing new here. The romance between Alex and Varik seems more like lust than love and could have been omitted with no real detriment to the overall story. Their history felt like something out of a soap opera, as did many of their scenes together. Alex devotes much of her time to being frustrated at others or doing something really dumb in the name of moving the plot along. One of the human characters suffered character derailment so hard I actually wondered if I had imagined them being relatable earlier in the book. Vampires, as is sometimes still the case, seem to be a stand in for every minority ever plus sick people, but seem to have some fairly original differences to the norm. The author also seems to have some kind of smell fetish just based on the number of times that the way a vampire smelled was mentioned out of nowhere. There were only two points in the book that unique scents among vampires was important to, so take those and maybe two tops to make it clear that the scent is a symptom of vampirism and you\u2019re good. The author also seems to think that every time a cell phone rings she needs to describe the ring tone, but that she isn\u2019t allowed to show use something about the characters by making it an actual song. Needless to say, I have more little issues with Blood Law than major positives, but as it is the author\u2019s first book I am probably going to give the second book a shot just to see if it gets better."}, {"userName": "Vannessa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4218118-vannessa", "userReview": "Alexandra Sabian is a vampire Enforcer working in a little town called Jefferson where half of the 6000 population are vampires.

He had an old world appeal with a heavy dose of sexiness to him. As soon as he showed up I was definitely hooked. The relationship between Alex and her brother Stephen was interesting. It provided some lighthearted comic relief to an otherwise dark plot. I'm conflicted on what to think about Alex. Some of the time she was a really cool character. She knew what she wanted and tried to go after it. But other time she came across as being whiny. Also, some of her abilities were a little confusing to understand.In regards to the plot, I think it was well developed but overall the book was not very fast moving. Things unfurled at their own pace, and while I wasn't rushing to turn the next page I was still interested enough to keep going.

Some have described it as a romance - not sure I'd agree with that, I'd say it's more of a murder mystery/crime novel...the fact that some of the characters are vampires and that two of the leads happen to have a romantic connection is almost secondary.I found some of the descriptive language repetitive, especially when describing the vampire's scents, but I think this was deliberate - unortuantely, it did slow the pace of the book down a bit. I was also a little bit put off by our lead man Varik having really long hair! Not my personal preference, but each to his (or her) own I suppose! The storyline itself was entertaining, with a nice little twist at the end, although I found it slightly unbelievable that the vampire/human liaison officer was so easily swayed in her opinion of vampires - it felt like this had been written in just to make the plot work, rather than it being a genuine way in which her character would behave. And I did find it slightly difficult to follow who all of the peripheral characters were, as well as a few subplots along the way...maybe I was just having an off week though, as I'm sure it wasn't that complicated really!All in all, an enjoyable read and a very good first effort for a new writer, trying to find new ground in an already swamped genre.

The positives include interesting secondary characters, a decent plot, and a desire to know what's coming next in the sequel. The criticisms I have are varied. Perhaps the biggest drawback for me is that the vampires are so watered down as for it not to matter that they are vampires. What's the point of them being vampires if they have no discernible vulnerabilities and no particular strengths that set them apart from humans? I kept waiting for something to pop up that would make me care that the main character is a vampire and thus is vulnerable to ___ and has superhuman ___, but nothing appeared to fill in the blanks. Additionally, some tighter editing really should have been done to eliminate overusage of \"caramel\" to describe skin tone or \"sandalwood and cinnamon\" to describe a character's scent. It almost became comical. There is definitely substance here, and it is worth reading, but I did find it a bit slow, and some of the loose writing took me out of the story."}, {"userName": "Missy Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1773601-missy-ann", "userReview": "DNF I *may* come back to it later. I just couldn't read it. I've had it since July and have only made it about 1/3 of the way in. Too many characters. Or maybe not, but everyone I've been introduced to?

Also, the lead female character's MOTHER is coming to town. Seriously? Maybe this is not unforgivable on the author's part, maybe there are some real life mothers out there that are completely delusional and come from OUT OF STATE to interfere in their ADULT children's lives. I just can not handle that in a story. It makes me want to grab a knife and get stabby.

Obviously, no one in the history of civilization has ever wanted to behead and stake a vampire, it's only this one vampire killing that it could possibly be related to.

The first book in the series is fantastic, and I can't wait to read on. All the characters have a very unique personality, and unlike most books where the side characters are almost as good as the main ones, the protagonists of this book outshone the other characters by a great margin. I loved Alex's personality, and it's a very nice change to read about a relationship that ended for a reason besides the typical \"I did it to protect you\" agenda.

I think I always enjoy these type of stories on a basic level. They're nice books to read when you have all day to waste and you want some decent supernatural/crime/sex entertainment. Are any of them truly that awe inspiring or highly original? Not so much. There are just so many books out there in the Adult Supernatural world and yet they all seem the same. Smart, savvy, sexy female heroine-check! Government agent of some sort-check! Psycho serial killer-check! Psycho killers motive somehow relating back to the smart, savvy, sexy female heroine-check! Smart, savvy, sexy female heroine being torn between her heart and her head-check! And last but not least...the incredibly hot, absolutely perfect, with a bad boy streak with a dark past, sexy beyond belief love interest-check! Oh and did I mention the incredibly long hair? Do you see what I mean? I haven't read all that much Adult Paranormal novels, but the few that I have tend to stick to that basic storyline. Plus can someone PLEASE tell me why older women find guys with outrageously long hair (usually longer than the female characters) so overwhelmingly attractive?! I. DO. NOT. UNDERSTAND! Please, just please, someone! Explain this to me! I just can't comprehend! Okay... rant and heavy sarcasm is over now. Besides the cookie cutter plotline, I still found this story enjoyable. I liked the fact that the author really stressed the fact that vampires and humans were two different species living side by side. Ya, ya, somewhat evident right? But for some reason I always think of vampires as humans with a nasty parasitic disease that like to munch on normal people for a good midnight snack. She really stressed the fact that they were two separate species and were not in the slightest bit human, no matter what the physical similarities. As far as I inferred, humans can't be \"turned\" either. Vampires are born, not made. (I think! Don't quote me! That's the gist of what I gathered while reading) I really kind of liked this more separatist take on vampires. Fangs grow in at puberty and if pulled, they don't grow back. De-fanging is akin to losing a limb. I just really kind of enjoyed the slight spin the author put on it. Not quite the same old vampire novel. It had just enough originality to keep me interested. As far as Alex went, I have rather mixed feelings on her. While I found her character, for the most part, enjoyable, there were still a few things that kind of bugged me. I liked her personality and her casual attitude. She seemed like a pretty laid back and likeable person. Did she seem like a Bureau worker? Eh... so so. I don't know, she just didn't really strike me as the cop type. I think it was because of her volitile emotions that kind of put me off. It's just hard for me to think of her having any type of authority. I don't know, I'm probably the only one that thinks this, but meh. Her reaction and emotions toward Varik? They were completely uncalled for. Ya the horrible incident in their past that caused them to break up was pretty out of line. Did he do it on purpose? No. Was it bad judgement on his part? Yes. Yet once again, he didn't do it on purpose. I would have forgiven the poor guy. He obviously felt horrible about it, and yet Alex still took off like a bat out of hell (there was no pun intended there). I just felt that for what happened, he didn't deserve the violent reaction from Alex that he got. I actually ended up really liking Varik. Aside from that cursed long hair (shakes head) he was a very nice guy. I have no trouble what so ever thinking of him as a high up Bureau agent. He just radiates bad ass government guy. He just has this aura of authority about him, and a don't mess with me attitude. Plus he is an incredibly decent guy. He never once pushed Alex, and let her leave. He never contacted her, never forced himself onto her, and was the perfect gentleman. He wouldn't even have come to help with Alex's investigation if he wasn't on orders. He respects Alex's wishes and does everything he can in order to help her solve her case. And despite everything that has happened, and the fact that Alex left him, he still loves her. I just really liked his character. Okay, so a slight mini rant again. Don't you just hate it when the author switches into the killers POV? I HATE that! What is the point of having a crime mystery when you know what the killer is thinking and his motive?! Where is the drama in that?! Gah! Drives me nuts! It's no fun reading about the heroine trying to figure out what the heck is going on when you already know. Do you see what I mean? I wish authors wouldn't do that. Totally ruins it for me. :/ I mean I guess I can see where authors are trying to come from. That whole \"insight into a twisted mind\" type deal. Well it's not insightful! It just proves that there are some sick people in this world who have the most twisted reasoning ever. We don't need to know what the killer is thinking to understand that he's nuts. Plus villains are always way scarrier when they have that element of mystery about them. Let's see what's scarrier. The killer who tells you exactly why he's going to submit you to a twisted horrible death, or the killer who just lets you wonder and then has fun with you just to see you squirm? Exactly. Okay for real now, ranting done. While the plot did give me some pleasant surprises, it wasn't really all that wonderful. Will I continue reading this series? Maybe? Sometime... in the future. Uhm... ya. If you love this genre, then I guarantee you'll love this book. But if you're like me and generally dislike cookie cutter plots I would stay away. Not bad by any means, just not anything truly gripping or new. BTW, this was The Traveling Book Gnomes latest pick. Sorry I have no pics to accompany my review.

Well, become an Enforcer, that\u2019s what! Alexandra, aka Alex, is a vampire Enforcer. She investigates crimes that involve the vampire community. Since the vampires have come out and have been let live like \u201cnormal\u201d humans, not everything is gumdrops and roses. Turns out not every human is comfortable with vampires living among them. Even though the vampires are not supposed to use humans as food, it doesn\u2019t always happen that way, and this is what Alex investigates. She also upholds the law that vampires should not be killed or hunted just for being a vampire. Alex doesn\u2019t come into this book without baggage of her own. Her father was killed, beheaded, when she was a little girl and the murderer was never found. That is why she became and Enforcer, to help solve crimes, but not every crime is easy or able to be solved. What do you do if what you are endangers your life on an every day basis? How do you protect your family from harm if you feel like you are right in the middle of it all the time? When murders of vampires in Jefferson, Mississippi start occurring that look just like the one involving Alex\u2019s father is it the same murderer coming to town to unsettle her? Will she be able to do what others all those years ago couldn\u2019t and find out who is committing these crimes (copy cat or not)? How far should Alex go to get to the bottom of a case?I was easily drawn into this vampire mystery book. There was always something that made me want to keep reading. Every chapter ended in a way that made me want to read \u201cjust one more before bed\u201d. When I first encounter Alex my first impression was that of a cocky vampire who thought she could control other vampires actions and could solve any case. As the book goes on though, I found myself caring and feeling for Alex. She is simply a woman who does what she does because of the effect her father\u2019s murder had on her when she was a kid. I could tell this was a character who loved her job as an Enforcer. She was caring, but wasn\u2019t afraid to tell humans or vampires how it is and what she plans to see happen to enforce the laws that let humans and vampires co-exist in Jefferson. What she doesn\u2019t share with anyone is that she has left some unfinished business back in her hometown many mile away. She was engaged once and was happy in a relationship once, only to have a horrible encounter tear that happiness away and make her flee to another far away city. The icing on the cake for me was when Alex finds out the murders that look like her father\u2019s are way above what she, alone, can handle and more Enforcers are called in to help her investigate. Alex expects a few \u201clab rats\u201d to come and help her, but what she gets is a man from her past that she would rather forget\u2026the very vampire that she loved once and shares an unwanted blood bond with. Can Alex and Varik work together again to solve the murders without letting previous issues impair the investigation? Can Alex really say that she no longer cares about Varik, and be telling the truth? Things get even more complicated when Alex\u2019s brother gets kidnapped and his bar is set on fire. The question becomes, how close is too close before Alex can no longer do an accurate investigation? I would recommend this book to anyone who likes vampire books or mystery books. It is a mystery book with a twist of vampires and a little romance dashed into the mix too. I couldn\u2019t help get engrossed in the story once I started reading it. The author also throws twists into the story that keep you guessing all throughout the book. Really was a good read. The ending kind of threw me for a loop though, just when I thought I had it all figured out\u2026.BOOM, something else I didn\u2019t see coming. 4 out of 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Rhianna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2000093-rhianna", "userReview": "Okay for a debut novelist, looking forward to more!The Federal Bureau of Preternatural Investigations uses its resources to solve crimes against vampires. Enforcers like fiery, fierce Alexandra Sabian and her former lover/mentor Varik Baudelaire, face trouble on all sides as they attempt to keep the peace between vampires and humans. A shaky peace that wasn't even known to be needed until the murder of Alex's father back in the 60's. When her dad's grisly murder prompted the vampires to reveal themselves the world was turned upside down.Decades have passed and even with plenty of water under the bridge there are plenty of folks who hate vampires. Jefferson, Mississipi's sheriff certainly holds no warmth for the bloodsuckers making up half the local population. When murdered vamps start piling up with a creepy similarity in MO to the murder of Alex's father the humans do more to hinder the investigation than aid it. Enter Varik and the dirty laundry never aired out between the two Enforcers. If they're going to work together and find the killer they'll have to fight fires both of the physical kind and the romantic. First I have to admit I probably didn't love Blood Law as much as I wanted to because I had some strong preconceived notions about the strong Southern heroine type. Alex is definitely cut from the right cloth, she's just been put together by a seamstress still new to the craft. There are a lot of characters brought into this story, for me as a reader there were a few too many to keep track of. Many of them were good, in particularly I liked Tasha, the liaison between the FBPI and the cops, but I feel like some of them were under developed. I'm not an editor so I can't really offer anything from that realm but as a reader I think the lack of depth to them made me not care about their parts of the story.The romance\u2014a very complicated one at that\u2014between Alex and Varik was a bit frustrating. There was a lot of back story I felt I was missing for too long. Once I finally got enough to understand some of the conflict between them I had a bit of an \"uh that's all it was?\" moment. Anticlimactic! Argh! Even still they make a couple I want to read more of. The actual meat of the story, the vampire murders plot, is good. My only beef with it is that sometimes it felt driven more by Alex's getting into one bad situation after another to the point of feeling a bit contrived. A little more natural flow (maybe have someone other than Alex getting hurt??) would have been good. One area I felt was really left open is the world building. As far as I can tell the vampires of Holmes' world are basically blood drinking humans with a supernatural gift. Long lives are hinted at but not a lot is elaborated on. If you're a reader who doesn't mind waiting for more details in a series I think you'll get just enough to keep you interested in following the characters into further installments of this series. And yes, there is a sequel in the works, I checked with Holmes to find out.Overall, I can't say I loved Blood Law, but I didn't dislike it either. Some of the previously mentioned areas kept me from being able to quite give it four stars but as a debut novel I think it's worth recommending to urban fantasy junkies like me who are looking for something fresh. Holmes has the right ingredients for an enticing new series all she needs now is to keep challenging herself as a newly minted author and we should be reaping the rewards very soon!"}], "description": "To stop a vampire killer, she\u2019ll have to slay her own demons first.\u00a0A provocative and savvy vampire, Alexandra Sabian moves to the sleepy hamlet of Jefferson, Mississippi\u2014population 6,000, half vampires\u2014to escape the demons lurking in her past.
