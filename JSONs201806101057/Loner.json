Thoroughly smitten. As our boy David tells his story to us, he knows your name and tells us what it is...even making small quips that your monogram of VMW mimics the slick and well put together car made by the Bavarian motorworks. But in this story, he writes his retrospective memories of it to \"you\" and not to \"Veronica.\" Like the kids at Hogwarts, your name - your being - is so powerful, that he feels he cannot refer to \"you\" by name. He begins to woo you by assisting with a term paper on the work \"Daisy Miller,\" and in a smirking bit of either self-mockery by the author or perhaps foreshadowing, our boy David explains to you that the theme of the tale is \"scopophilia.\" Scopophilia, he explains, is the pleasure that comes from gazing at (perhaps stalking?) the object of one's desire. For your term paper - because you are a bit of a ditz and are seemingly incapable of depth (how did you get into Harvard anyway? your family's immense wealth?) - David writes the essay for you. He states, \"The heroine captivates the scopophilic Winterbourne because he can only surmise as to the mystery of the \u2018ambiguity of Daisy\u2019s behavior\u2019 beneath her deceptive, problematizing pulchritude.\" David explains that pulchritude means beauty. What a hideous word to describe loveliness - yet this is often how David expresses himself. He takes the semi-arcane, polysyllabic way nearly every time. He enjoys bantering about grammatical and syntax errors. His is the way of words. There is obvious irony of course in the scopophiliac nature of his own role but also in the fact that aside from his English class, he mentions his ETHICS course here and there. This author is having some fun, and I was too in reading it.David is not a likeable character, but because we ride along inside his head, we want to yell out a warning. No! Don't write that paper for her - she is obviously using you. If caught, you'll be thrown out of the one place in the world you have been dreaming of for years. This is Harvard!

From his first glimpse of Veronica, he could not get her out of his mind, putting aside new friendships, a young woman who actually cared about him and even the Harvard experience, all became meaningless. Things o be discarded. To say I disliked David from the very beginning would be an understatement. The same goes for Veronica, who though she did little in the beginning to draw onto herself the obsession, clearly thought she and her friends were better than others, entitled.So my dilemma, how to rate a book that so clearly made me uncomfortable? That does not leave one with a good feeling? The writing itself was quite good and obsession is the main theme of the book, so the fact that the author made me feel this way shows it accomplished what it set out to do.I think it was because these are ordinary people, things like this happen often. We see it in our news, sometimes with horrific results. There are some graphic sex scenes, this is a true time college environment with different mixes of people. Even the ending is true too often, deplorable really. So glad my children are out of college because I found this to be a rather frightening book.

A slow roll, this thought-provoking character study is so well done. The writing is excellent. I found the story so compelling that when I wasn't able to read, I downloaded the audio and listened to it. This story did something very subtle and seemingly impossible: it created a vivid, authentic setting that made me wax nostalgic for my own college days, while simultaneously drawing me in and making me feel more and more uncomfortable. There were inevitable questions that began to take shape for me as I was reading and suddenly my carefree college memories gave way to doubt and insecurity about my perceptions of safety, intentions, acquaintances, and missed opportunities that may well have been best left alone: that cute guy who was hanging all over me at a Halloween party, insisting I was beautiful despite the fact the my face was painted as a skeleton. He gave me his Red Cross card so I had to call him the next day to return it (I didn't); the super cute guy in Zoology who stared at me to the point that his cuteness no longer mattered and often followed me to my dorm to ask me out (no, thank you); the guy in my dorm who others claimed had assaulted them but to me this seemed inconceivable (he wasn't interested in me); the guy who came into my work to declare he couldn't stop thinking about me after I apparently waited on him weeks before. (Sweet? Or extremely creepy?). So many things I have wondered about, both in the moment when my well-meaning friends called me cynical and paranoid, and after the fact over the years. I'm sure I have mentioned here before that I am the daughter of a homicide detective. The world for me has never felt particularly safe. Still, this story left me shaken and a little off kilter. This is insidious. This is unique.

Teddy Wayne builds this relationship slowly at first, then deftly thrusts the reader into literary whitewater rapids in which I kept looking for the next dangerous rocks. The last 30 pages were like watching a long fuse burn toward a powder keg, or seeing another neurotic, introspective Hahvahd freshman, Quentin Compson, browse around Cambridge before diving into the Charles River--with Wayne's nod to Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, as near the novel's end the anti-hero David sees the plaque that is actually now on the Anderson Memorial Bridge above the Charles which reads \"QUENTIN COMPSONDrowned in the odour of honeysuckle.1891-1910\" Anderson Memorial Bridge in Cambridge, MA and Plaque to Quentin CompsonThis highly clever fireball of a relatively short novel has an explosive ending with a few unexpected surprises.

I\u2019m having trouble rating Loner. I really enjoyed it until the end, which I first found clever but ultimately quite disappointing. Loner is a first person narrative about 18 year old David Federman who starts his first year as an undergraduate at Harvard. Loner is also David\u2019s second person narrative addressed to Veronica Wells, who is also a first year student at Harvard. Most of the story is David\u2019s sad pathetic attempt to get Veronica to pay attention to him. Which she does every now and then, which makes David\u2019s efforts even more sad and pathetic. When I say I enjoyed Loner, I don\u2019t really mean that it was an enjoyable reading experience. It was actually somewhat painful and full of cringe worthy toe curling moments. David is really book smart but he\u2019s awful at reading people. But it\u2019s hard to feel bad for him because he\u2019s also really unlikeable -- quite awful really. Teddy Wayne does a really skilful job at conveying David\u2019s inner voice. And he throws in some great tidbits about literature, literary theory and life on an elite American campus. So, he had me reading along with admiring \u2013 albeit cringing \u2013 interest, until the end. And the end has a very clever twist \u2013 a form of poetic justice -- and then for me the end\u2019s cleverness was marred by an unnecessary final event that didn\u2019t seem to fit with the rest of the book. But I won\u2019t say more to avoid spoilers. Do read Loner if you like books about unlikeable characters, unreliable narrators and academic settings. And if you read it, let me know how you feel about the end. Oddly, Loner hit a personal note. I just sent my 18 year old son off for his first year in university. Fortunately, he\u2019s nothing like David. But Loner definitely fed my parental anxiety\u2026Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."}, {"userName": "Andrew Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith", "userReview": "David Ferderman is a bright boy, a very bright boy. He coasted through high school, achieving outstanding results \u2013 good enough to secure a place at that renowned institute of learning, Harvard. But he made few friends along the way; he was somewhat invisible to his classmates, a withdrawn, \u2018vanilla\u2019 presence (though maybe absence would perhaps be a more apt description). He\u2019s shy and withdrawn \u2013 as the title suggests, a classic loner. But in his own mind his world is about to open up, he\u2019ll meet new people, impress them with his intelligence and insight and start to experience all the social interactions he\u2019s missed out on thus far.His parents are New Jersey lawyers and as they drop him off at Harvard he bumps into a rather plain but friendly girl who will feature large in his life over the next twelve months. But this isn\u2019t the person who\u2019s going to occupy most of his thoughts during this period, that honour goes to the beautiful but frosty Veronica. As soon as he spots the her, David falls for her hard and he is determined to find every possible excuse to try to impress her. To this point I felt the narrative was leading me down the path of one of those campus romps where nice boy seeks pretty bad girl but is destined to see the light and, after ritual humiliation, settle for plain nice girl. But that is to under estimate the gifts of Teddy Wayne (a new to me author). Federman shows guile and perseverance in his quest to attract his prey but this starts to turn into something a little more sinister. His actions and his mindset begin to feel dangerously off-kilter. The guy now started to creep me out a little and I began, for the first time, to feel a bit uncomfortable.However, the descriptions of life at Harvard including interactions between staff and fellow students was so well done that I felt truly drawn into the story. I wasn\u2019t liking the lead character too much at this point but I was keen to know how the whole thing was going to play out. So it was through squinted eyes that I continued to follow events. I won\u2019t go into any detail regarding where the story goes from here but I will say that it didn\u2019t play out as I expected. I gobbled this book up in the course of a few days, during which I was curiously drawn back to it any time I had a few minutes to spare. But once finished I was confused as to my feelings about it. On one hand I\u2019d found it to be an intelligently written commentary on gender roles \u2013 what\u2019s acceptable and what isn\u2019t between males and females. But on another level I found it to be an uncomfortable insight into the mind of a relatively young adult which (to me) begged questions about parentage and the role of other influential people in his life. Maybe, because I\u2019m seeing this from a perspective of someone who has a son of similar age, who is also intelligent and introverted, I might be projecting my own concerns here. I\u2019m still not sure at this point. And deep down there\u2019s another troublesome thought \u2013 one even closer to home \u2013 a nudging worry that given the right circumstances could it be that we\u2019d all find we have a smidgen of Federman inside us? I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions but I do know that this is a book that has unsettled me more than anything else I\u2019ve read in recent times.My thanks to Simon & Schuster and NetGalley for providing an early copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jaidee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17295672-jaidee", "userReview": "2.5 \"overly assured, overly clever, overly cocky\" stars !!! I can understand why this book is a critical darling. It is razor sharp with lots of cleverness, witticisms and full of literary and political references. However, the book is lacking in depth, substance and the wrapping paper is so pretty covering an empty paper box. The book revolves around an upper middle class 18 year old boy named David who is accepted to Harvard. He has spent his life on the sidelines not understanding why the world does not see him as the special snowflake that he is. There he meets Veronica, a beautiful, mean and manipulative girl that is wealthy, worldly and has the world by the cojones. He becomes obsessed with her and projects onto her a romantic delusion about their place in the world as the King and Queen of Magnificent. However, Veronica, is a tad too smart and machiavellian and underneath her designer veneer lies a female sociopath but of the lower order variety. Sounds terrific huh ?

I tend to like stories that take place in and around College. Teddy Wayne is an award-winning author, and Federman is such a Jewish name ... I was curious just how meschugena ( crazy, insane ), David Federman might be. The blurp says David Federman is academically gifted - yet never felt appreciated. He was a forgettable classmate in High School. Early in the novel, we get a good idea that David doesn't want to be invisible as a Freshman at Harvard. I wasn't expecting him to be a mensch, ( a good guy), but I had no idea he was going to be a shmendrik, ( a person who is a jerk, only a MUCH bigger jerk than normal --basically, master of all jerks). He was so annoying while trying to impress his new friends that he could turn all their names around-backwards. His talent was to reflect the world in a linguistic mirror. \"Why is an apple not an elppa\". Desperate - lacking chutzpah - he is obsessed over a girl named Veronica. Completely out of touch with being able to read her signals - and respect them- that she is not interested....David has tunnel vision- is somewhat delusional. The purpose of his Harvard Days...( the author throws the word, Harvard, around like its confetti), is to get the glamor girl to melt over him. She doesn't. He's still a loner!*This story is easy to read - straight forward- no surprises- but what makes it good is our AWARD WINNING AUTHOR....and all that he didn't write. His prose and intelligence is top notch...qualified to write a tale on the HARVARD CAMPUS....but what I like is all that 'isn't' being said. All the things the author didn't write. Teddy Wayne leaves us with our emotions exposed....( irritated, angry, frustrated, a little frightened, sad, puzzled, and if you are my age, possibly reflecting back to your college and or High School days).

The quadrisyllable that halves its beats at the middle name, dividing again at its pluralized terminus of subterranean depths. The percussively alert 'c' drowsily succumbing to the dozing 's.' Perfectly symmetrical initials, the 'V' found twice upside-down in the 'M,' inverted once more in the 'W,' and, if spoken, easily confused with a German luxury automaker.\"David Federman is an academically gifted student, but he's never been able to make much of an impression socially. While he had a group of friends in high school, they all tended to be those on the social fringe. As an incoming freshman at Harvard, he hopes things will be different. He's ready to trade witty barbs with fellow classmates, become noted for his academic prowess, forge friendships that will last for a lifetime, and, of course, finally have some luc in the romance department as well.But his chance to reinvent himself socially doesn't seem to be working, and he finds himself part of a very similar group of social misfits as he had in high school, although this time there are a few female members, and he seems to have a reasonably easy rapport (and a great deal in common) with Sara, one of the group's members. And then David sees Veronica Morgan Wells. Veronica is beautiful, intelligent, worldly, and seems to carry herself with immense poise and social grace, the antithesis of David's life to date.David is convinced that Veronica is the one for him, and all he has to do is prove it. He does everything he can to set up situations where she'll get to know the \"real\" David, to see him for the smart, witty, generous, romantic guy he knows he is. But as David's obsession with Veronica grows, he starts to make questionable decisions that have ramifications for him academically, socially, and morally. Even as he realizes that Veronica isn't the person she seems to be, he still feels the need to finally be noticed by her as an equal.\nLoner\n is an interesting look at how someone who has always been on the fringes of life\u2014partially by choice and partially because of the social pecking order common to high school and college\u2014finally wants to be noticed by the \"in-crowd.\" It's a book about struggling to find yourself when you appear to be surrounded by a sea of people who already have found themselves, and how feeling you have never really made an impact on anyone starts to take its toll. It's also a book about how we fail to notice what we actually have as we strive for what we think will be better.Above all, however, \nLoner\n is about obsession. David isn't quite the stalker that we've traditionally seen in books and movies, yet you can feel just how palpable his longing is. As you watch this mild-mannered, significantly intelligent young man transform into someone completely different, you wonder whether these characteristics have been latent in him all along, or whether he simply began cracking under the strain of desire and the need for acceptance.I thought this was a good book, but my main problem was that I found David not particularly likable, which, I guess, is understandable given his actions. I understood his desire to be noticed, to transcend the social doldrums in which he always seemed to find himself, and his inability to recognize what he actually had right in front of him. But as his desire for Veronica intensified, I didn't find him sympathetic in the least, so while I was interested in seeing how the story unfolded, I didn't really care about his plight.I've never read anything by Teddy Wayne before, and while I didn't find David to be a particularly compelling character the entire book, I thought Wayne did a great job with the \"Harvard voice\"\u2014the types of things Harvard freshmen talk about when having social conversation. Even David's own thoughts, as evidenced in the quote that began this review, were well-voiced.

This is better than a 3-star.The Loner was a mixed bag for me. I'm not sure how to rate it. Teddy Wayne is a competent writer, there's no doubt about it. If he meant to create one of the most unlikable characters I've ever read, then kudos to him, he succeeded. Because, David Federman, eighteen-year-old Harvard freshman is a sociopath. He's sex-obsessed, like most young men. He wants to change his social status, from a loner to a more popular student. Nothing wrong with that. He's very articulate and his grasp of the English language is far above everyone else's. I like when authors use big words, I like to learn new words, yet for the most of the book I wondered \"who talks like this\"? Do any eighteen-year-olds speak/think like that? Even the very smart ones? It felt like too much. I also had many \"yewww\" moments. Let's just say that one is best kept in the dark when it comes to a young man's thoughts and observations on sex, intercourse etc. If Wayne tried to make David unlikeable through this, well, he was brilliant.In saying all that, I'm glad I didn't abandon the novel and read it to the end. Because, around the 85%, it got really good. I can't tell you why, because I don't want to spoil it for you, should you decide to read it. I forgot to mention, that, throughout the novel, Wayne switches from the first to the second person narrative. David is an unreliable narrator, who's obsessed with Veronica, a very beautiful, privileged freshman. The second person narration reminds me of You by Caroline Hepnes, where another sociopathic guy is obsessed with a young woman. So in conclusion, I appreciated Teddy Wayne's writing skill. He managed to create a very unlikable character, who's beyond redemption. I was so irritated with him, not even his nerd status endeared him to me (I usually go for the underdog). Again, if that's what Wayne intended to do, he did it very well. Come to think of it, I'm so ... I don't know what I am with this novel - because David is so real, he could be or is like many others we've met or could meet, which is scary. None of the scenarios are far fetched, so that makes the whole thing even scarier.There is more to this novel than a freshman's obsession with a beautiful girl. The Harvard setting is a good background to talk about social status, the obsession with succeeding, at all cost. Sexism, feminism, elitism, sexuality, relationships are addressed as well, some in more depth than the others.I'm guessing this is going to be one of those novels you either love or hate. While I hated the character, as you should, there's no denying Teddy Wayne wrote a good novel. I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.

An unlikable, reproachable, repulsive main character. That's why I loved Eileen. That's why Joe Goldberg from Caroline Kepnes' books is so delightful to me. Yes, you heard right. DELIGHTFUL.So, when I opened this book and began reading about David Federman, I was hooked. I was fascinated. He's very intelligent, he's super bookish, he's in his first year at Harvard. He's also a virgin, socially detached - a \"loner\". When he lays eyes on Veronica, the delicious and malicious obsession begins.In addition to the creepy main character, there's so much that I enjoyed during this compulsive read: 1) The setting - cerebral, high achieving Harvard and the academic-fused-with-social/sexual-hierarchy that is student life.2) The many references to literature, which included The Yellow Wallpaper, The Sound and the Fury, and others.3) Point of view - 2nd person narrative, which immediately had me think of You, but which ramped up the stalker tension as David intimately addresses his story to Veronica. This boldly illustrates his scopophilic (pleasure from gazing at the object of your desire) tendencies.4) The clever unraveling, which is truly unpredictable.This is a psychological, literary character study that will make your skin crawl. David is someone who you might pass on the street, meet at a party, and you would never guess what lies under the surface. What keeps this from being a 5 star read is the ending, which somehow fell flat for me. I haven't worked out exactly what I hoped for, but I think I needed more.

That was the first term that came to mind, but don\u2019t stalkers usually work from a distance? If so, then David would be different. Peripheral stalking is only a first step. He wants more. He wants to be a part of Veronica\u2019s life.As a character, David is pretty well unlikeable. Not a big surprise. I have to believe this was a wholly intentional move by the author. Shitheads aren\u2019t supposed to be liked. Supposedly Ted Bundy was a charmer, easily to like, but then again no one had the chance to see just what was going on inside that head of his. It\u2019s the outer shell we see, unless you pick up this book. How good is the actor, and how long can he play the part?So when a main character is hard to like, what\u2019s of interest? Well, the progression of David\u2019s game gets a little intense. I kept waiting (hoping even) for the mistake that would bring down the house of cards he had so carefully constructed along the way. Call me a stalker\u2019s stalker, but I wanted to know the outcome. A funny thing happened along the way. As much as I wanted to trip David up, a part of me felt sorry for his nutty self. He\u2019s insanely smart, yet weirdly naive at the same time. Add to this the realization that Veronica would have benefited beautifully from a kick to the heiney \u2013 the pompous gluteus maximus that she is. Who to root for then? If there\u2019s anyone to like, it is Veronica\u2019s roommate Sara, the one David uses as a pawn to reach his goal. Collateral damage sucks.Interested so far? Here\u2019s another reason to read this book: the final quarter throws a wrench in the works. I had a feeling that something different might be coming. Pretty good ending."}, {"userName": "Dita", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26261386-dita", "userReview": "Ughhhhh....this book had \"hcus esimorp\"!!

Instead of focusing on his studies, as I am sure a freshman at Harvard would be doing, he begins obsessively stalking another student.This is a fast paced book that is a real eye opener into the disillusioned mind of a young man. I thought it was interesting how Teddy Wayne slowly builds David\u2019s character; from the reader somewhat liking him in the beginning of the book, to then becoming creeped out and by the end completely disliking him. It is written in such a way as to make you feel like you are inside a stalker\u2019s mind. I read an interview with the author and he stated that he felt compelled to write about young men who are labeled the loners in society and researched teenage killers. You can definitely tell he did his homework on this one."}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38727943-jenna", "userReview": "From the time I was in the second grade, I'd go upstairs for part of the day and have my reading and English classes with the sixth and seventh grade classes. In all, it was a wonderful arrangement, with the only unfortunate consequence that I sometimes read texts that were within the scope of my reading comprehension, yet well outside the scope of my maturity. For instance, after reading an article about what would transpire on earth once the sun burns out, I could not be convinced by any means whatsoever that this would not occur imminently. For weeks I soldiered on bearing a sense of impending doom, casting anxious glances skyward to assess time remaining until oblivion. And the other most notable example of my eyes being bigger than my brain was in my reading of the Daniel Keyes novella Flowers For Algernon, which reminded me of Teddy Wayne's Loner in its fluent portrayal of an unreliable narrator whose level of insight ebbs and flows - or in the case of Loner, perhaps simply ebbs! - throughout the course of the book.So without spoiling either book, let me first try to explain what made Flowers For Algernon so traumatizing to little me. Basically, the narrator of FFA, Charlie, undergoes some radical brain-based changes that he's sometimes, but not always, able to anticipate and describe. However, even when his cognitive and behavioral changes lie beyond the scope of his awareness, the reader is fully able to tell what's going on, which creates a terrifying and helpless feeling of watching someone about to be hit by a train. In my case, reading at the very self-referential age of eight, my takeaway was that if Charlie could be undergoing such transformation unbeknownst to him, then the same could happen to me, and therefore, logically, MUST be happening to me at that very moment! As those who've read that novel will understand, this outcome would be equally as fearsome as the prospect of a burned-out sun, only even more so, because in this case, the sun would be my HEAD, which would surely result in my banishment from seventh-grade English.Now, Loner works in somewhat the same hypnotic fashion, only a little differently. Instead of just merely witnessing a narrator's progressive suffering as we do in FFA - and also in Loner, where the narrator, David, pushes the cringeworthy boundaries of social awkwardness from the very beginning of Harvard freshman orientation week - we also become progressively, uncomfortably aware of the narrator's potential to create, or perhaps even inflict, suffering as well. As FFA's Charlie increasingly loses touch with reality, we become increasingly aware of the catastrophe that may befall him, whereas as Loner's David increasingly loses touch with reality, we become increasingly aware of his capacity to generate catastrophe or generally precipitate and participate in chaos. Basically, the reader is slowly, deftly, inexorably led to believe that something bad is going to happen to someone, and it's somehow going to involve David and most of the other main characters, but we don't exactly know the whos, whens, wheres, or whats - or, as a surprise plot twist reveals, even all of the whys and hows. As with Flowers For Algernon, we simultaneously know both more and less than the narrator, and this makes for a hell of a mouse maze to navigate. (Flowers For Algernon inside joke!)As many have stated, Loner is a rapid page-turner that's hard to put down and easy to pick back up. I'd describe it as a character-driven literary thriller. Wayne deserves kudos for his unique and rather macabre twist on the Ivy League campus novel as well as the \"Say Anything\" or \"Can't Buy Me Love\"-type \"geek boy pursues golden girl\" story. Although the threads tie together quite neatly in the end, I must say the book sat a little lightly with me once it was over: it was an engrossing read while it lasted, with a resolution aided by a clever latebreaking surprise reveal, but I wasn't left weightily pondering it for days on end. I'd compare it to a perfectly executed egg sandwich, but that's not a knock. After all, sometimes nothing's more delicious than that perfect egg sandwich, especially after you've been subsisting on mysteries that all too often resemble the mush of campus cafeteria marinara, cereal, and soft-serve."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "Almost DNF'd.

He is a person of no redeeming value or traits. He's not attractive, talented or exceptionally bright and witty. A part of me had a difficult time accepting how he even managed to matriculate at Harvard.I was bored when I began this book. When I came to the end, I was still bored and now just annoyed.

No, not a nice guy. A nice guy. Trust me there's a difference.A nice guy is a good person who\u2019s nice for the sake of being nice. A nice guy? He wants you to think he\u2019s a good person. He\u2019ll go to an awful lot of trouble to show you what a wonderful, caring, genuinely good guy he is. He\u2019ll be there to give you a hand when that term paper isn\u2019t going well. His shoulder is available to cry on when you get in a fight with your boyfriend. He\u2019ll be your designated driver when you have one too many at the frat party. He\u2019ll always, always be there for you. But everything a nice guy offers you comes at a price. And when he comes to collect you\u2019d better be ready to pay him back with interest.David Federman is a nice guy. He\u2019s passed through high school as one of the nameless drones no one can quite place when they look through their yearbooks. Even his own sisters think he\u2019s strange and his mom is forever trying to make sure he\u2019s socializing enough. To say people are surprised when he reveals he\u2019ll be matriculating at Harvard in the fall is putting it mildly. But there he is at freshman orientation already working out how to elevate himself out of the mire of dorks and nerds he\u2019s been forced to socialize with all his life. He\u2019s smarter than all these losers, better than them. He\u2019s going places and someday soon everyone is going to see it.David\u2019s going to realize his destiny as a great man no matter what.Then he sees Veronica Morgan Wells slouch into the room. A daughter of privilege, calm, cool, and floating effortlessly above the rest of the rabble jockeying for better places in the grand social hierarchy. With a jolt he sees that she alone is the key to everything he\u2019s ever wanted in life. She will grant him entry into that elite world he\u2019s only managed to glimpse thus far. He sees inside her in those first few seconds, every dream, every desire, how closely linked they are in all things. It\u2019s like they\u2019re the same person. They were born to be together. There is simply no one else in the world who will ever understand her like he does. In the span of a heartbeat he knows she\u2019s his destiny, she is the instrument to set him above the rest, she is all he\u2019ll ever need. They are perfectly in tune and perfect for each other.He just has to make her understand that.What follows is an agonizing story of one boys increasingly desperate attempts to get the girl he wants to even notice he\u2019s alive but on a scale that would make Tom Ripley blush. David is so cunning and quietly cruel as he lays his careful plans and arranges \u201caccidental\u201d meetings. Before long he\u2019s dating Veronica\u2019s roommate and making himself available to help her get through her homework. To say he doesn\u2019t care about the people he steps on or rules he breaks would imply that he has some level of feeling about them at all but he doesn\u2019t. Everything and everyone are just little stepping stones to his goal. His moves are calculated and executed with a kind of indifferent military precision down to the way he sighs in a conversation or how he\u2019s standing when Veronica comes around a corner.The narrative, told in David\u2019s voice, is all directed at Veronica. Everything is done for \u201cyou\u201d and because of \u201cyou.\u201d Everything is \u201cyour\u201d fault.Because eventually it\u2019s clear that all the careful planning and crashing of elite private parties isn\u2019t going to make a bit of difference because Veronica has some plans of her own. And maybe David isn\u2019t quite as smart as he thinks he is.This was a creepy book no doubt about it. David is a horrifying character because he\u2019s so calm and matter of fact about everything. He\u2019s completely disconnected from everyone but manages to maintain a perfect mask of typical college boy that\u2019s all the more terrifying because the reader is the only one aware of it. To everyone else he encounters, with the possible exception of Veronica, he\u2019s exactly what he appears to be, sweet, a little awkward, super smart and funny in a dorky but adorable way.When the mask slips the book also takes a different turn and I\u2019m still coming to terms with what I think author Teddy Wayne was going for with his twisty turny ending. When David loses his cool he does it in spectacular fashion and going to such dark extremes, and so quickly, may stretch the boundaries of believability for some readers.But there\u2019s another aspect of Wayne\u2019s story that makes me even less comfortable. David is a character who feels the world owes him something. He deserves the sexy, smart, rich girl. He\u2019s entitled to her. Hell he\u2019s entitled to whatever girl he wants because he\u2019s a nice guy. I get that. There are guys like that in the world. The one\u2019s who tell a total stranger how pretty she looks and then call her a bitch when she doesn\u2019t say thanks. The guy\u2019s who want a list of reasons when a girl says no to a date because just not wanting to say yes isn\u2019t enough. I know those guys. The guys you see spouting off on the internet about sluts only dating a-holes while the nice guys get stuck in the friendzone. That\u2019s the kind of nice guy Wayne\u2019s created in David and I have no trouble buying it.What Wayne stops just short of outright saying with his strange, unsettling finale is that David has a right to his anger and his revenge when he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. There\u2019s a hint of righteous, personal anger in this book that left me feeling like Wayne might have had a little nice guy in him somewhere that needed to stick it to every single jerk who didn\u2019t see him for the amazing, brilliant, genius, sex god he knows he is. There\u2019s a hint that the people David hurts deserved it.And it\u2019s that uncomfortable, nasty little knot Wayne\u2019s left in my brain. That nagging worry that this book is meant to say \u201csure he was a creep but couldn\u2019t she have been nicer?\u201d or \u201cyeah what he did was bad but what she did was worse!\u201dMaybe that\u2019s how I\u2019m supposed to feel after a book like this. Lost and sickened that people are capable of such casual, barbaric treatment of one another if it means they\u2019ll get to sit at a \u201cbetter\u201d table in the dining hall or have a cooler girl on their arm. That something as pure as love can be so easily confused with coveting someone like they\u2019re an expensive pair of jeans. That a woman can deserve to have her safety compromised, her security and sense of self destroyed because she wasn\u2019t nice to the guy who was so nice to her. That she deserved it."}, {"userName": "Maha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23423831-maha", "userReview": "What happens when the bright but shy boy meets the attractive and popular girl? Teddy Wayne brings to us this story in his very suspenseful book, Loner. The premise Teddy Wayne chose for his book is a very interesting one. The bewildering university classes and campus with all its alluring brightness and meanwhile struggle. Yes. Struggle. The struggle to enter the adult world and leave behind the teenage and childhood long years.David Ferderman is a very bright yet shy student. He has always been that good boy. Always adhering to rules. He is one of those unpopular boys who sought the company for each other as a means of survival among the overwhelming dynamics of school teenagers. He had never been outstanding so no one noticed how hard he had worked, until it happened. He was accepted at Harvard.Yes, he was accepted at Harvard, which seemed to thrill his parents even more than him. His parents had worked all their lives to afford the average standard of living and an acceptable life style for their kids. It\u2019s true it was nothing above average, yet it was all they could get them and for sure David was their very precious golden child. In their overprotective way, they denied him the social life that might have enabled him to face college society and later on life. Their only focus was on study. And may be that was the reason for what came later on in this interesting story.David had all the enthusiastic dreams about his upcoming life at Harvard. He was very proud for sure, and he had a deep belief that he had super intellectual capabilities. Yet, his problem was his inability to engage with social activities. He was always awkward when it came to socializing. Of course he didn\u2019t admit it to himself.But, when David laid his eyes on Veronica, this was the start of all the inevitable. Veronica, the most attractive and prettiest girl he had ever seen. And also, the mysterious Veronica. And like when two orbits collide, David\u2019s life was completely changed when his path collided with Veronica\u2019s. Two people coming from totally different backgrounds and leading completely different lifestyles. Yet, David couldn\u2019t take Veronica out of his mind. This was the collision, and all what happened next was the result of this collision!This is a very interesting story. And trust me when I say, it\u2019s not the usual story of the loner and nice college boy meeting the very popular pretty girl and falling for her. No. There\u2019s more to this story than that. It hovers over many other edges that it will be kind of spoiler to reveal.One of the things I liked most about this book was the suspense. I was always eager to know what comes next. I went from one chapter to the other with wide eyes. I had some guessing, yet none of my guessing came true. At first I thought it was the classical story of the unpopular good boy falling for the popular bad girl, but as I read I was thrilled to see the story twisting beyond that.Loner was a very interesting and quick read. College life is one of the most interesting reads for me. Who can forget that? Don\u2019t we all have those memories of college life?**Special thanks to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for supplying my copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
