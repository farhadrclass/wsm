The O'Briens run the local shop, they're working class and Clare is only able to further her education by being gifted and winning scholarships. The Powers are 'to the manor born', David is off at boarding school for the early parts of the novel but eventually follows in his father's footsteps by studying medicine. You can already guess where this is going, yes, this is Maeve Binchy's Romeo and Juliet. Of course the plot involving Clare and David is actually only one storyline in this vast 737-page novel which spans the entirety of the 50s and the early 60s in Castlebay. Binchy is at her absolute best when she is juggling several plots. Where many authors struggle to tie everything together, Binchy has an almost Dickensian talent of making everything connect and tie-up naturally. However, where in other novels Binchy is fully able to fill her usual 700+ page count with ease, in Echoes it seems that for every page of plot there was an accompanying page of filler. It also does not help that I found this novel to be uncharacteristically sentimental for Binchy. She always writes stories of love and marriage but she usually balances that out with some genuinely moving and, sometimes, shocking content. Who can forget the abortion in Light A Penny Candle for example? Binchy teases us in the prologue of Echoes by telling us about the body of a dead man floating in the sea off the cliffs of Castlebay, but she does not return to this ghastly scene until the very end of the novel - 700 pages later. Meanwhile you've got to deal with the just-about-bareable Clare and the posh daddy's boy David. I feel that I've talked about the length of this novel quite a lot in this review but honestly that is my biggest criticism. There is absolutely no need for this book to be as long as it is. Binchy writes big books, but this isn't a big story. I often found myself getting bored and realising that I had 400 or more pages left. It is unfortunate. Echoes is a vast and well-written novel. There are many characters in here that would be considered 'classic Binchy' and it is often very funny. However, tweeness and boredom set in after the first couple hundred pages and never really leave. Overall, it's a fine novel that displays Binchy's wit but the editor should hang their head in shame."}, {"userName": "Jenna St Hilaire", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4665623-jenna-st-hilaire", "userReview": "For the first three-quarters of this story, I loved it. For most of the last quarter, I had my arm drawn back, ready to send the book flying against the far wall. Binchy held off anything resembling resolution for the main characters to the last two or three pages, and all I can say about that without spoiling it entirely is that though it was nowhere near a rainbows and unicorns ending, I didn\u2019t throw the book across the room after all.Binchy, despite her stylistic licentiousness regarding commas and her tendency to pose questions without using a question mark (one of my pet peeves), is a fantastic storyteller. Her people live and think and feel with the beautiful and awful, hilarious and poignant inconsistencies of reality. The situations she describes are relatively everyday\u2014at least, the everyday of small-town Irish Catholic life circa 1960\u2014but they hold the reader\u2019s attention nonetheless.The history, odd as it feels to use that term for something as recent as the Fifties and Sixties, was interesting. Set in the last years before Vatican II unleashed its mixed bag of major changes upon the Catholic Church, Echoes snaps a picture of the time within the place: firm country traditionalism, unexamined and unfair as it often is, and yet both beautiful and correct in its way; young people caught up in education and city anonymity, trying their strength against the boundaries of morality and stigma and scandal.The one fault I found with this book was that in a couple of respects, it was Circle of Friends, second verse. In both novels, the boys did what they did for the same halfwitted reasons and justified themselves with the same witless excuses. I'd have appreciated it if one of them had at least pretended to understand that he was in the wrong. But in this case, it was worse; it seemed an unnecessary, even irresponsible inclusion\u2014a method not of developing the primary characters, but of bringing the Gerry Doyle plot thread to its climax. It's not unimaginable that I've missed the point, however.All that aside, I had little trouble understanding and loving most of the characters. Angela O\u2019Hara might have been my favorite; brilliant and beautiful and single, desperate to do the right thing while avoiding scandal. She was absolutely sympathetic. Clare suffered so much that I could not do less than love her, though at one point\u2014maybe two or three\u2014she could have used a stiff talking-to, not that it would have worked. Mary Catherine and Valerie and Josie are humanly lovable friends with very believable weaknesses and strengths.There were a handful of characters who were unsympathetic or difficult at some level, and in every case the author controlled this fabulously. Molly Power and Gerry Doyle and Sean O\u2019Hara are too ordinary to seem like villains, but they come off all the more villainous because of their ordinariness. Shuya makes herself both problem and solution. Chrissie is a mess and a mystery.I don\u2019t know how I feel about David. I may never decide that. I don\u2019t see him as loathsome as, say, Kristin Lavransdatter\u2019s Erlend, but he\u2019s not Taylor Caldwell\u2019s Luke either.Dick Dillon, however\u2014there\u2019s a man and a hero for you. Father Flynn, likewise.Perhaps I should say one more thing about the ending. As noted before, it\u2019s not rainbows and unicorns. It\u2019s not entirely satisfactory, and everybody doesn\u2019t get their perfect understanding of just how bad they were and how they ought to go on. It is, however, a step toward redemption. And I appreciated that."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1676789-melissa", "userReview": "Anyone who knows me knows that I am in love with the world that Binchy so easily creates. So, they may be surprised that I am only giving \"Echoes\" a 3 out of 5. While her setting, cast of characters and storytelling abilities are as top-notch as ever, this book left me strangely unsatisfied. My main issue seems to be one that is \"echoed\" forgive the pun, by many of my fellow reviewers. Mainly that the love story of Clare and David is not given enough time to develop in comparison with the rest of the book.I'm all for falling in love fast, but their love just didn't seem real to me for most of their relationship. In my opinion, David, who was stifled by his overbearing parents was drawn to Clare because he knew his mother would disapprove. My suspicions of this are given weight by how easily cheats on her with Caroline, and how little regret he feels.Clare, did eventually prove to me that she loved David, but only after she burned the pictures and was willing to forgive everything. She certainly is an amazing character with rarely paralleled strength. However, all that being said, even though I know what the final scene of the two leaving Gerry's funeral together was meant to portray, I still can't shake the feeling that the only reason they were sticking it out is to prove to everyone that they weren't wrong. I wasn't left with a feeling that love conquers all, but more that stubbornness conquers all. While I love the realism, I still am not as enthralled as I wanted to be."}, {"userName": "Maureen Mullis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4447292-maureen-mullis", "userReview": "Imagine it's a rainy night, and you and your best friend are sitting in comfy chairs in front of a fire.

I really don't like giving low ratings, but this book sucked the life out of me, that I couldn't even give it 3 stars. Looking at the back, I would think it was all a love story and all about Clare and David, but in the first few pages, there were so many characters in it, I couldn't tell who from who. Probably blame it to me just reading at a moving vehicle, but still! First 300 pages were meant to emphasize how different Clare and David were. No romance or whatsoever. And a little pages meant for Angela O Hara's miserable life. When it finally reached page 300, the characters just suddenly blurted out that they loved each other. Really frustrating for a book which I patiently read 300 pages for, plus the fact that the book had a really tiny font and letters looked stuck to each other.Anyway, I willed myself to finish this book. Perseverance paid off, only to end up in more than a stack of disappointment. Clare had a really really bright future ahead of her. But she settled with David. She lost her career, and was stuck at home, taking care of her daughter and endlessly trying to please her mother in law. But that's not the worst part. Despite her sacrifices, damn David Powers had to have an affair. But the worst part isn't over. Maeve Binchy had to end the book with a cliffhanger. This is actually the first Maeve Binchy book I read, and I'll probably pick not another of her works in the future."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3269646-amanda", "userReview": "The village of Castlebay is a tiny little place atop some cliffs on the coast of Ireland. In the summer visitors flock to the little caravan park and the houses for rent, but in the winter the place is deathly quiet. In the late fifties three restless children grow up together in Castlebay: Clare, the daughter of the shopkeeper, who works and works to earn a scholarship to college; David, the son of the doctor, destined to follow in his father's footsteps but dreaming of much more; and Gerry, dark and gypsy-like, and a total heart-breaker. Echoes follows their stories as they intertwine over the next decade - they all manage to break free of the paths set by their parents, but will they ever escape the echo of their past?I read Maeve Binchy for the comfort - the falling into a different pace of life, where villagers gossip to each other, and often marrying right is the only ambition a girl might have. At the same time as being slightly frustrated at the backwards attitudes on show, I like to reflect on how such a short time ago abortions were completely taboo, women didn't study and classes mattered so much more than they do these days.Echoes is a different breed of Binchy - rather than the usually uplifting and ultimately hopeful tale she tells, this is a dark and disturbed tale in the most part. The ending is truly tragic and few of the characters are very likable.I struggled to read to the end - it felt akin to watching Eastenders or Coronation Street (unnecessarily bleak and gloomy). When your escapist go-to comfort read is a little too much like real life, it becomes less escapism and more realism.Having said that, I enjoyed Binchy's portrayal of life in what seems to be a foreign land. The idea of a village who couldn't accept a priest who had decided to marry; the fact that gay people were referred to in horrified terms; the way that post-natal depression is laughed away (how can any woman be depressed when she has achieved what God intended her to do?) It is almost a form of historical research, since Binchy shows easily the fishbowl view of living in a village.This particular quote emphasises the attitudes of the time: \"Don't boast of it, you little tramp. Don't stand there like a slut in my kitchen and tell me what you were eager for and what you weren't. You've ruined us all in this family. We'll be the laughing stock of the place - marrying into the Powers no less. Do you think that Mrs Power is going to let the likes of you cross her doorstep? Do you think that woman is going to let her son, with the fine education he has, marry a girl from a shop in Castlebay?\"As I said, there are very few truly likable characters - even the best of them have moments where you wish you could throw the book across the room because of their manners, or beliefs, or actions. I never like adultery in a book, and the occurrence of it in Echoes is particularly heart-breaking, which made it very hard to endure.I wasn't a fan of the story. I enjoyed the writing and enjoyed the historical relevance of the novel, but the actual plot and characters let Echoes down in a big way. If you're going for a Maeve Binchy novel for the comfort, I would suggest either Circle of Friends or Firefly Summer. If you do happen to like dark and bleak sagas with a heavy dose of tragedy, then this should prove very satisfactory."}, {"userName": "Trish at Between My Lines", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15939692-trish-at-between-my-lines", "userReview": "I must have originally read this book about 25 years ago and it's one of my comfort books. Yes, I know most people have comfort food but I have comfort books! This book is the literary equivalent of wrapping yourself up in a warm blanket, settling yourself on an old but comfy couch and having a long gossip with a good friend. It's heartwarming (but still gritty), the characters are multi dimensional with lots of flaws but remain engaging. Echoes gives a lovely snapshot of Ireland as it used to be in the 60's (No!, I wasn't around then! But according to my mother it's authentic). Not that it's rose tinted, there is a lot about social class divides and the ending is not a happily ever after one but it is realistic"}, {"userName": "Ilse Van den Langenbergh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27776242-ilse-van-den-langenbergh", "userReview": "Wat gaat dit ontzettend traag vooruit.

It's a story about many different people in a small town on the coast of Ireland. Some set goals and work hard for them, others do not. One fellow had movie star good looks, was very smart, but never committed to anyone or anything. Girls loved him. It was fascinating watching what happened to these people over the course of many years. Some people I loved, others I disliked. The only negative for me was the ending.

Genre: relationships fiction.CAUTION SPOILERS:It was sad because a guy cheated on his wife. She suspected it all along but never wanted to admit it to herself. When a friend proved it to her, her husband was sorry but couldn't say so and he couldn't make any promises for the future. Yet, she forgave him and I assume stayed with him. That was too sad for me. I wished there was more explaining why he did it, or reasons to trust that he wouldn't do it again. I'm writing this a day later, and I'm still sad thinking about it.

There is love, betrayal, family dramas, friendships and the town itself. Reading Binchy's work is always so restful and I can just imagine it in an Irish accent. It also makes me want to visit and live a life in a small town....though the whole thing about everyone knowing about your business I could probably live without.I learned about Maeve Binchy's demise as I was reading this book, I was very sad, but at the same time very grateful to have her works live on.

It is not a short book nor a quick read, but is so emotional in so many ways that you nearly want to cry at one time or another for most of the characters! You will also likely find yourself genuinely caring about the people who you will spend years getting to know\u2014years of their lives, not years spent reading this book : ) \u2014and hoping that they eventually get what they deserve: good or bad. It is sad, it is heartwarming, and it is a worthy book to undertake. I also felt compelled to add it to my 'religion' shelf, as it is clear that the religion in the southern part of Ireland is a significant aspect of their lives. This is the second book where Catholicism has played a major part in the story. The first was a history of Ireland and both that book (Ireland: A Novel by Frank Delaney\u2014also very good!) and this one spent a great deal of time pondering and describing the Catholic faith and what it means to the people of Ireland. As I am not a Catholic, I do not understand the depth to which that religion drives their followers.

This is 1950s/1960s Ireland, and I think the ending is in perfect alignment with the mentality of the time and place. The fact that Clare's first reaction to the news of Gerry's death is 'thank God' just says so much about how all consumingly-devastating it would have been to her if those pictures got out, if the problems in her marriage would have been made public, etc.Just as frustrating to the modern mind, I felt, was Angela's despair over everything to do with her brother Sean. But it's mostly frustrating that she was more than likely dead on in her anticipation of the town's reaction to the news. I loved the stretch of time this book covered. Despite its absurdities, I love stories from that period in Ireland, and I feel like these characters so perfectly illustrated it over the course of their lives. The hardship, the severity of the class system and the strictness of their religion, but also the innocence and simplicity of the time.

But I admire most her ability to capture the nuances of people, especially those who live in and/or come from small towns. _Echoes_ offers astute characterizations, but it is not a light read. Other readers have commented that they did not like this book as well as some of her others, in part because it is not an \"escape read\". I recommend this book because it is an unflinching tale of people in small-town Ireland in the late 1950's to early 1960's.

It was a desire that knew no class, no barriers, only the urgent hunger of two people destined to love and ready to defy any convention used by a world determined to keep them apart.Even at fifteen, David Power knew eleven-year-old Clare O'Brien's dearest wish, to win a school prize. But it was years before Dr. Power's cherished only son recognized in the huckster's daughter his own heart's desire. Here in Castlebay, perched precariously on the seaside cliffs, the lines between them were clearly drawn. Clare's only hope is to leave the town where time stopped, propelled by scholarships to Dublin, fueled by her own drive and brilliance, far from the insular, gossipy world of Castlebay and those held in its thrall...Angela O'Hara - beautiful, insolated, a teacher trapped in the convent school, who risks everything to help Clare escape...Gerry Doyle, the town charmer who finds in Clare the woman he vows to have at any price...Caroline Nolan, the beautiful, rich outsider who comes to plunder.For Clare, that was before the wild freedom of Dublin, and love. And David. Before fate drove them back to Castlebay, and the past. I truly enjoyed this book, as I usually do with any book by Maeve Binchy that I read. Reading Maeve Binchy's books, even rereading some of them, as this particular book Echoes was for me, is almost like returning to familiar places and visiting old but very familiar friends.

This is the first book that I've read by the author. To be honest, the first third of the book seemed extremely slow going to me. I thought that the character backgrounds that Binchy plotted out were extremely vast and overdone. BUT, by the time the storyline really picked up, I was entranced. I'd already developed emotions and opinions about every character, and Binchy really has a way with using a plot to play on those emotions and question your loyalty to those characters. Brilliant. As the title might suggest, Echoes is a book that might echo the lives of many young-and-deep-in-love couples today, even though this book takes place in the 1960's.This book offered a lot of surprises, and though I'm sure that even though many would categorize this novel as \"chick-lit\" that I certainly don't.

The lives of the 3 are closely intertwined, and we follow them through the 1950's and early 1960's. Clare rises \"above her station\" and wins a scholarship to secondary school, and again to university. David becomes a doctor. Angela finds happiness, after years of trouble and care. Binchy depicts the minutia of daily life in a very small Irish village brilliantly, and while at times, the story threatened to get bogged down in details, overall the details were what brought the characters to life. The ending is bittersweet, and I think came too quickly. After the years of build-up of the relationship between David and Clare, I felt that the denouement deserved the same amount of attention.

My favorite character should have been Clare but she is just too much for me...I liked Paddy...the town doc...he was just so down to earth and nothing seemed to phase him. A great read...especially in summer at the pool. I plan on picking another one of her books as my next read. I guess I plan on keeping my summer reading light...."}, {"userName": "JodiP", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7247043-jodip", "userReview": "I've really come to appreciate Binchy. She can write about really tragic things so beautifully. This one was a bit of a meandering tale, but I enjoyed the characters and how they grew. In some ways, she puts a pretty gauze over all things Irish; the week I read this, the story of the 800 children in a cess pit came out. But, I suppose one could argue taht the kinds of thigs she writes about also happened: the gentler side of Ireland. I was so sad for Clare, and how her pregnancy completely ruined her dreams. No dual career in those days!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth (Alaska)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska", "userReview": "As good as any Maeve Binchy I've read, with her characterizations of good and caring people, none of them perfect but all trying to make the best of the life handed them. This book is a bit longer than most and a bit more tension than usual. It opens with a prologue which has the towns people finding a body on the beach. Whose body is it - murder, accident, suicide - and who will care deeply when all is said and done?"}, {"userName": "Michaela", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61119483-michaela", "userReview": "Enjoyed reading Echoes but found parts frustrating where there was lots of build up to events like Sean arriving back in Castlebay and then hardly a mention of him after his return.

But it was years before Dr. Power's cherished only son saw in the huckster's daughter the answer to his own heart's desire. Here in Castlebay, perched precariously on the seaside cliffs, the lines between them were clearly drawn. Clare's only hope is to leave the town where time stopped, propelled by scholarships to Dublin, fueled by her own drive and brilliance, far from the insular, gossipy world of Castlebay and those in its thrall... Angela O'Hara, beautiful, isolated, a teacher trapped in the convent school, who risks everything to help Clare escape... Gerry Doyle, the town charmer who finds in Clare the woman he vows to have at any price... Caroline Nolan, the beautiful, rich outsider who comes to plunder...For Clare, that was before the wild freedom of Dublin, and love.
