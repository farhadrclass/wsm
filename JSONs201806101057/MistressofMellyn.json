It's the quintessential \"governess in peril falling in love with someone above her station\" plot. It's a pretty good, old-fashioned novel of its type, one of the better Victoria Holt novels I've read here and there over the years.Martha (Marty) Leigh is an impoverished gentlewoman forced to become a governess due to her circumstances. She takes a job in Cornwall, a corner of England that, I was surprised to learn, actually has a subtropical climate (palm trees!). Her duty is to teach and care for the obstinate, emotionally neglected daughter of a widowed (of course!) master of the mansion, Connan TreMellyn. Connan's wife Alice disappeared a year ago and died in a train crash while running away with another man ... so they say. But Martha still feels Alice's presence around the TreMellyn mansion.To thicken the plot, we have Peter Nansellock, a handsome neighbor paying Martha some extra attention; his kind sister Celestine; Gillyflower, an emotionally disturbed young daughter of a dead servant and a gentleman who abandoned her; Lady Treslyn, a vividly lovely, young former actress and the wife of an elderly lord, who seems to be waiting for him to die so she can marry Connan; a devoted and gossipy housekeeper with a taste for whiskey in her tea; and various other characters.Victoria Holt's writing style is prosaic; it's never going to inspire me. But she draws a good plot here. The murder mystery bubbles along under the surface until surfacing with a vengeance late in the pages of this book. There's just a little spookiness here (is Alice really haunting the mansion? maybe...) to flavor the plot.Recommended for readers who like old-fashioned gothic romances. March 2017 buddy read with the Retro Reads group."}, {"userName": "Carol  \ua9c1\ua9c2 ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25867535-carol", "userReview": "[ I find it hard to believe ending up with ten children of her own, plus Alvean & Gilly is a happy ending.

I did not remember that! What a great read! I am still thinking about this book after finishing yesterday. This was really good! I know I read it as a teen. My mom had all those Victoria Holt's from the Doubleday Book Club. I remember this title quite well. And I read all of her books when she finished. I just don't remember any of this story. Great characters and setting. Oh so gothic!I really enjoyed it quite a lot. So atmospheric. I didn't like Marty at all until about halfway thru. She was annoying at times. Her whole \"don't look down on me bc I am just a governess\" attitude was tiring. But, I might would have felt/acted the same way back in the day. Midway thru...the dance...awwww, I could picture it. I wish this had been made into a movie. It would make a really great one. Wonderful ending. Big smile on my face. I love the way the conflict was resolved on this one. I sat outside on a Sunday afternoon in the sun and read most of this one. Pure escapism. Very good romance/suspense novel. I highly recommend it for those that enjoy those good old gothics and the setting of Cornwall. And great old houses with a stubborn child, a governess, a very desirable employer and father of the stubborn child, coastline, murder, mayhem. It's all right here.

And when I read the opening words I was so glad that I did.\u201cThere are two courses open to a gentlewoman when she finds herself in penurious circumstances,\u201d my Aunt Adelaide had said. \u201cOne is to marry, and the other is to find a post in keeping with her gentility.\u201dAs the train carried me through the wooded hills and past green meadows, I was taken this second course; partly, I suppose, because I had never had an opportunity of trying the former.Martha Leigh \u2013 known to her family and friends as Marty \u2013 was travelling on the same journey that I have made many times in real life and a few times in print too. She was travelling through Somerset, through Devon, and across Mr Brunel\u2019s bridge into the Duchy of Cornwall.I liked her. She was sensible, she was bright, she was curious and she was understanding; in just the right proportions. And she was to be a governess, to the young daughter of a wealthy widower. I thought that the position might suit her rather well, and indeed it did.She quickly wins over the household staff, but it takes her a little longer to win the confidence of her young charge Alvaen. And no wonder, when she has lost her beloved mother, when her father, Connan Tremellyn, was cold and remote, and when a number of governesses had come and goneMarty could understand Alvaen. She could build a relationship with her. She could lay plans to help her win the approval of her father that she so desperately craved.But she couldn\u2019t understand Alvaen\u2019s parents.How could Alice, who it was clear had been happy and loved, leave her daughter and her husband and run away with an old lover? Maybe she hadn\u2019t \u2026How could Connan neglect his daughter so? How could he take up with the younger wife of an elderly neighbour? Maybe he had a plan \u2026There are echoes of Daphne DuMaurier and Charlotte Bronte here: a grand mansion on a Cornish cliff, haunted by its former mistress; a plain young woman set against a dark and brooding hero; hints family of family secrets \u2026Fortunately Victoria Holt had the ability to take those familiar ingredients and create something a little different. A well executed work of gothic suspense, where as soon as one question is answered another one appears, as soon as one crisis is averted another has to be faced, until one final drama resolves everything.She brought that that house on the cliff, and the surrounding countryside to life with wonderful descriptive flourishes. I could see Marty and Alvaen in the schoolroom, I could see then watching a grand ball from above, I could see them on horseback out in the grounds \u2026And I could understand them. The governess who was happy in her role, but who struggled with her position in between the family and the household staff. The unhappy child who blossomed when she was shown real care. And all of the others; every character rang true.There were some lovely touches, in the dialogue, in the descriptions, in well chosen details, and everything was held together by good old-fashioned storytelling.I can see similarities between Victoria Holt and Mary Stewart; they were near contemporaries but Victoria Holt\u2019s settings are earlier and she seems rather more gothic; from the start though, I thought that her heroine could have fitted into a Mary Stewart novel quite beautifully.Sadly there were some weak spots. When the romance came to the fore it didn\u2019t seem as natural as it had when it was mixed was the suspense. The ending seemed a little rushed, and I would have prefered a fuller conclusion in the final chapter to the epilogue that was offered instead.None of that stopped me from loving Mistress of Mellyn, but it did remind me that the books that inspired it were far finer.So I\u2019d like to read them again before long, and I\u2019ll give any of Victoria Holt\u2019s other novels that cross my path a fair chance too."}, {"userName": "Veronique", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12371602-veronique", "userReview": "3.5 (for Retro Reads)\u201cThere are two courses open to a gentlewoman when she finds herself in penurious circumstances,\u201d my Aunt Adelaide had said. \u201cOne is to marry, and the other to find a post in keeping with her gentility.\u201dI\u2019d never heard of Victoria Holt but this gothic romantic story was full of suspense. The plot follows the well-known plight of the governess, having to find a position to survive, finding such role only to realise that all is not as it seems. Martha Leigh, vicar daughter with no prospect of marriage, accepts a post to take care of 8-year-old Alvean, who has lost her mother in tragic circumstances. Upon arrival, our heroine is faced with a resentful and defiant child, gossipy staff, well-meaning neighbours, an orphaned girl left to haunt the place, and an absent master. That is until he arrives on the scene...Let\u2019s not forget the setting. We have the huge old house, bursting with nooks and crannies, a potential ghost, and also the beautiful and atmospheric Cornish landscape.It was inevitable that this book would remind me of Jane Eyre. It is however quite different. I enjoyed the thriller aspects, from the growing feeling of uneasiness and doubt, to the big reveal at the end, as well as the growing relationship between Martha and the two children, Alvean and Gilly. However I found the romance to be the weakest link, not being able to \u2018accept' either of the male suitors. Holt does shape them from typical 19th century patriarchal moulds but neither was hero material for me. I wonder if this is due to the author\u2019s writing style or the characters themselves? I had no such qualms when I read Bronte\u2019s masterpiece...

For a Gothic romance it had the spooky house, strange happenings and the broody hero. That was about it. Most of the events were pretty much everyday things, with a few clues drops from time to time, but not enough to figure out what happen to the wife who all of a sudden- up and took off with the local man-hoe and then was killed. The clues that were dropped were far and few between.  The romance was on the \"meh\" okay side. I didn't understand why Martha fell in love with Connan, and sorta understood why Connan fell for Martha even if it was sudden (marry me! I love you!). The surprise twist was the best part and made alot of sense, but again I would have liked a little bit more clues and maybe a bit more suspects. With Martha following the clues then worrying about Connan's mistress and if he loved her or not. It was a nice book to past the time with and great writing style that I may read more Holt in the future, we shall have to see."}, {"userName": "MomToKippy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4631503-momtokippy", "userReview": "This is my second Holt and I am still thrilled with her. I think she will prove to be one of those authors I can pick up anytime and be assured of a good read. I see many similarities with her construction and characters compared to The Shivering Sands but that does not detract for me. I still love the way she slowly weaves the mystery, reveals the characters bit by bit and gradually builds the gentle romance. Just as in TSS, I found all the characters to be intriguing and developed. I love the banter of conversation amongst them - humorous, revealing, flirtatious, mysterious, heartfelt. I find her writing style in general very easy to read and flowing but not insulting to one's intelligence. Again, I was unsure of the culprit until close to the end.

In addition to Alvean, there\u2019s a mysterious young child, Gillyflowers, who sings to herself and whose mother committed suicide. Martha determines to win both children and show Connan he is wrong about them all.So she teaches Alvean, who supposedly can\u2019t ride a horse, to ride well. And she begins to teach Gilly, who all think a bit daft, to read.But there\u2019s a mystery surrounding Connan\u2019s wife\u2019s death and the goings on around the large house on the edge of the sea that soon capture Martha\u2019s attention.

There are the siblings from the neighbouring mansion, who are both friends and rivals of the TreMellyins. Clementine wants to marry Connan and mothers Alvean constantly, while Peter is a flirt. Over time, Martha realises there are far too many secrets in the small household and she begins to pry them out little by little.

She was right! This book gives a new meaning to a five star rating: \u201camazing\u201d\u2026 Amazing in the sense\u2014How could this book have been published?!I\u2019ll admit the story had potential. When I first started it, I thought it would be like those old Catherine Cookson novels I used to love to read in my early teens. Once I was a third of the way into the story, I was embarrassed that I even made that comparison. Cookson\u2019s books are much better written, with better storylines and good developed characters. Though I\u2019m truly surprised that Cookson\u2019s books are for the most part out of print, while books like this are still in circulation.Holt\u2019s story is a mess. Some ideas are introduced, but never fully explored. The ending\u2019s rushed and the concluding events are never fully explained. The murderer never explains the motive behind his actions. It\u2019s all left to conjecture by the narrator, the governess. And when you really consider all the things the murderer did, you begin to wonder how that person could have done it all without an accomplice. For example, loosening and tossing a boulder from a cliff. You also wonder what was the real motive behind those actions. Did that person have a prior claim to the house? And this suppressed hatred the murderer supposedly \u201cfelt\u201d seems strange, when throughout the book, that person was genuinely nice and affectionate to everyone, without fault\u2014that kind of feeling is rather hard to fake. It all seemed too easy.Also, the book lacks historical accuracy. For instance, in Victorian times, it wasn't common for women to attend a funeral procession; only men witnessed the burial of the loved one. So for the governess to witness the body of Sir Thomas, a neighbor of her employer, being placed in a tomb is highly unlikely.The characterization made me laugh. Connan, got to love that name, is never developed in the book, yet he\u2019s the main heartthrob for the governess. They hardly ever speak, only a brief word to each other occasionally, but only about business. Holt develops her secondary character Peter, the neighbor next door, more fully than Connan, and because of that I almost wished that he were the leading man. At least he was entertaining. Though in all fairness Connan does have some gem lines when he suddenly professes his love:\u201cShould I have prepared you for the shock? \u2026 I am sorry, Miss Leigh. I thought I had managed to convey to you something of my feelings in this matter.\u201d\u201cI want to marry you because I want to keep you a prisoner in my house.\u201d\u201cI am a dissolute, degenerate philanderer. I am going to say was. Because from this moment I am going to be faithful to one woman for the rest of my life.\u201dWith a few laughs, it was an easy read, but left me ultimately unsatisfied."}, {"userName": "Graham", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1760824-graham", "userReview": "NOTE: I've just discovered, purely by chance, that Goodreads have deleted a couple of my old reviews from the site. Luckily, I had a backup of this one:This Gothic romance packs plenty of punch thanks to the myriad plot ingredients to be found lurking within the pages. The wonderfully Gothic setting is Cornwall, more specifically an ancient castle on the clifftops; it is a location haunted by tragedy, where people die, go missing and walk into the sea, never to return. There are secret peep holes and priest holes and a wood nearby that it\u2019s easy to get lost in. The sea cries mournfully against the rocks and the castle itself may well be haunted by the spirit of its previous mistress, who died in a terrible train wreck.All is well and good, but what of the story? Victoria Holt was one of the many pseudonyms used by the insanely prolific author Jean Plaidy (the name in itself is a pseudonym!) during the \u201860s and \u201870s. Under the name of Victoria Holt, the author turned out dozens of similar Gothic romances, all packed with brooding heroes and mysterious plots. This book is one of them. The template is clearly Jane Eyre, which is no bad thing if you\u2019re a fan of Charlotte Bronte\u2019s classic. Indeed, Connan TreMellyn, the taciturn, mysterious hero who is saddled with a daughter whom he doesn\u2019t love, is in many ways a Cornish variant of Mr. Rochester.The author goes for the \u201canything goes\u201d approach, weaving lots of different strands into the narrative. Some are more effective than others. The romance, always kept understated and virtually in the background, is handled admirably. The mystery of the story is very slow paced \u2013 it\u2019s not until the final pages that we learn the real truth of Mellyn\u2019s history \u2013 and I would have liked to see a little more incident. However, the writing is strong, simple and fluid, making this a book that is very easy to read and follow. Holt has a gift for natural-sounding dialogue and the period setting is expertly captured.And so the story goes on, the pages filled with all kinds of ingredients: there\u2019s the whisky-sipping gossip of a housekeeper; a mysterious mute girl, almost spectral, who hides in the woods; a secret assassin; a poison pen and more charged, fizzling sexuality than you can shake a stick at. Martha Leigh is an eminently likable heroine; she\u2019s clever, smart and shy, and the scenes in which she dances in the darkness with Connan are wonderfully sexy.As a whole, this is a work of popular fiction that has been authored to delight a specific readership: those who like their romances full of mystery and tragedy, with hints of the supernatural thrown into the brew. While some of the plot ingredients might today be seen as clich\u00e9d, the writing is fresh and engaging enough to make it a winning read."}, {"userName": "Misfit", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1375548-misfit", "userReview": "\"There are two courses open to a gentlewoman when she finds herself in penurious circumstances.......One is to marry, and the other to find a post in keeping with her gentility.\" With no other prospects in sight, Martha Leigh takes a position as governess for eight-year-old Alvean TreMellyn at her family's estate Mount Mellyn in Cornwall. Alvean's mother Alice has been dead for a year, after she ran away with her lover they both died in a tragic train wreck - burned beyond recognition. Her father Connon is cold and withdrawn, especially with his daughter. Martha settles in and builds a relationship with both Alvean and the waif-like Gillyflower and she also finds herself attracted to the master of the house (well of course!), but then things soon begin to go bump in the night in typical Holt fashion. Does Alice's presence still live on at Mount Mellyn? Did she really die in the train wreck? Why is Connon so remote from his daughter? What about Connon's relationship with the beauteous but haughty Lady Treslyn? Who framed the last beautiful governess for theft so that she lost her position and was forced to leave? Does someone want Martha out of the way as well? What about these mysterious blinds in the house where one can watch what is going on in another room without being seen? Does the house have more unknown secrets? That's as much as I'm going to tell - read it for your self! Like a couple of the other reviewers, I noticed a definite similarity between parts of this story and Rebecca and Jane Eyre (but that's a good thing), although she's still got a surprise or two in store for you that will keep you turning the pages until the very last reveal (gad, what a nail biter). While she's not quite up to the perfection that is Du Maurier, I think you'll find this a perfect comfort book to curl up with in front of the fire with a glass of red wine and chocolate. 4/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Misha  Mathew", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3809685-misha-mathew", "userReview": "Review:Books by Victoria Holt are a must for all lovers of Gothic suspense/romance, I have been told. My mom devoured her books when she was a young girl herself. The problem was actually finding her books . Not many people read Victoria Holt , I guess . After a lot of searching, I spotted 2-3 Victoria Holt books in a library. Since Mistress of Mellyn was among her best known ones, I chose this.I love anything gothic. Gothic Suspense had been one of my favorite genre since I discovered and read Rebecca when I was 15.Mistress of Mellyn though having undertones of Rebecca was very engrossing. It was unputdownable.Martha, the heroine enters as a governess as a last resort in a wealthy family living in a mysterious house called Mellyn Manor. She's given the responsibility of Alvean Tremellyn, the only daughter of charming yet cold and mysterious Conan Tremellyn. Martha is drawn to the mysteries and secrets that lie behind Conan's wife's mysterious death. She's sure there is more to her death than what meets the eye...Mistress of Mellyn was a very enjoyable read for me. I did nothing else while reading it. Comparisons to Rebecca are unavoidable, for the very obvious reason. The main premise of both novels revolve around \"mysterious deaths.\".Mistress of Mellyn lacks the haunting quality of Rebecca. There was a creepy feeling while reading Rebecca ...a feeling that something bad's going to happen.Still, Mistress of Mellyn was a fun intriguing read. The suspense was well done.Nothing brainy or anywhere near to Rebecca but gripping gothic suspense!Overall:Engrossing suspense!Recommended?To all fans of the Gothic genre, fans of Victoria Holt,Bronte sisters and Daphne De Maurier."}, {"userName": "The Lit Bitch", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4537892-the-lit-bitch", "userReview": "This book was a cross between Rebecca and Jane Eyre with a dash of The Woman in White. I adored it! I wasn\u2019t crazy about the ending but that said I LOVED this book!I thought the motive for the crime wasn\u2019t substantial enough. I had hoped there would be more justification and explanation at the end but there just wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t think the motive justified the crime. The ending was WAY too fast for me\u2026.there was so much build up and then suddenly it was over.But other than the ending, the novel was fantastic! It was very atmospheric and suspenseful. There are a couple of different mysteries going on which make this novel enjoyable on so many levels.There was a lot in the suspense forum as well as the romance category. Connan TreMellyn was Mr Darcy of sorts\u2013arrogant and proud but at the same time, he was charming and gracious. I could see why Miss Leigh was so taken by him.I loved Miss Leigh. She was educated, sassy, and strong. As a heroine, particularly a Gothic heroine, she was perfect! I loved that there was a strong equestrian theme in the book, as a hunter/jumper equestrian myself, that made the novel all the more of a favorite for me!There is a lot to love in this classic Gothic romance! Victoria Holt holds a special place in my heart as an author. She\u2019s the queen of modern Gothic Romance/Suspense novels. I love her story-telling style and would read any of her Gothic novels without question.See my full review here"}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2805400-rachel", "userReview": "I read this book as part of a Gothic challenge; I selected it because my task was to find a book with a Gothic looking cover on it. This cover obviously has everything you would want in a gothic novel: A woman looking ghost-like at twilight, near a rocky ocean side, with an old, foreboding mansion in the background. The content of the book is classic Gothic romance as well: the governess is taking care of a petulant child whose mother, Alice, is dead, and the father/man of the house, Connan, could be involved in something nefarious, and questions about Alice's death are raised. Of course there is also a love story, which is that the governess, Martha, is falling in love with Connan! What I liked about this book is that the story moved along very quickly (although at times I thought it could have been a little slower) and I couldn't predict the ending. Maybe other readers did, but I thought I had the mystery of Alice figured out and to my surprise I did not! There were moments when I was sure things were going to go very bad, and I was nervous for many of the characters. Martha is a strong female character and I loved how she stood up to people (particularly men). I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a quick read and who wants to get their feet wet in the genre. I thought the story could have used a little more creepiness, but that's just my personal taste. Ultimately it was a good read and actually my first Victoria Holt book."}, {"userName": "Lisa (Harmonybites)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites", "userReview": "This Gothic romance first published in 1960 is one of those rare romance novels I read as a teen that I remember--and remember fondly; it still holds up on a read decades later. These days you find Holt in the general fiction section in my neighborhood Barnes and Noble, not the romance section--indicative of its near classic status as a work of \"romantic suspense.\" Set in Victorian-era Cornwall, the heroine, Martha, is entering a position as a governess at Mellyn. This is a well-written first person narrative, though the prose style isn't the equal of du Maurier or Stewart, it's better than all but a handful of the books found on the romance aisle. There are some memorable lines--Martha to someone flirting with her: Since I resemble a hedgehog, at least I'm not spineless. And she isn't, although I think she harps too much on her lowly social status as a governess. Comparing her again to Stewart (and there are a number of similarities to Stewart's Nine Coaches Waiting) Holt strikes me as melodramatic--but certainly atmospheric and spooky. I liked Martha's relationship with the two children in this story, Alvean and Gilly--the last so striking a character she's the clearest memory I had from my first read decades ago. The book works well as a mystery with a good twist."}, {"userName": "Hasan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5694494-hasan", "userReview": "One of the books on my father\u2019s bookshelves. Bought back in the year 1981. Over all, it was an interesting read with colorful characters. I haven\u2019t read a suspense novel in a while so I suppose I enjoyed it a bit more. Miss Leigh is the most dim-witted governess ever. If one believes in the stereotype, that women are confused creatures, Miss Leigh, surely lives up to that stereotype. I really enjoyed the ending more than the start of this book.The finishing lines by the author are worth mentioning here. \u201cWe are born, we suffer, we love, we die, but the waves continue to beat upon the rocks; the seed time and the harvest come and go, but the earth remains\u201d.It\u2019s certainly not one of those books that you will read again, but it\u2019s worth a read."}], "description": "Mount Mellyn stood as proud and magnificent as she had envisioned...But what about its master--Connan TreMellyn? Was Martha Leigh's new employer as romantic as his name sounded? As she approached the sprawling mansion towering above the cliffs of Cornwall, an odd chill of apprehension overcame her. TreMellyn's young daugher, Alvean, proved as spoiled and difficult as the three governesses before Martha had discovered. But it was the girl's father whose cool, arrogant demeanor unleashed unfamiliar sensations and turmoil--even as whispers of past tragedy and present danger begin to insinuate themselves into Martha's life. Powerless against her growing desire for the enigmatic Connan, she is drawn deeper into family secrets--as passion overpowers reason, sending her head and heart spinning.
