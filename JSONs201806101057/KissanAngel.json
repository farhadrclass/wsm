Please. I\u2019m begging you, fellow readers.This is not your typical story. This is not your typical book. This is a story that you have never read\u2026.trust me. It is anything BUT typical. The story begins with an arranged marriage. No, it\u2019s not set in the medieval times. It\u2019s a modern arranged marriage. Say what?! I know. It seems off-putting at first. But we quickly get to know Alex and Daisy, and the reason for the arranged marriage takes an approved back seat for a while. This story is set at the circus. Yes, I said the circus. Weird?? Absolutely not. Mainly because SEP is a genius. Alex is a trained expert with bull whips. Yep, it\u2019s gets dirty real fast, ladies. No, he doesn\u2019t actually whip her (for those of you who are afraid of reads that are too dark, although I wouldn\u2019t mind a little whipping, heeheehee), but the promise of whipping is there. The sexual chemistry and witty dialogue are off the charts. \nWe can do this easy, or we can do it rough. Either way, I'm going to win. You decide how it'll be.\nMy Alex:Alex. Alex. Alex. I would die for him. What a fantastic character. He was abused by the whip when he was a boy. He believes he is literally incapable of love. He is mysterious because he doesn\u2019t reveal much about himself to Daisy. He purposefully tries to push her away because he doesn\u2019t want her to fall in love with him. He doesn\u2019t even want her to get comfortable, so he puts her through hell, expecting her to give up. I love LOVE/HATE relationships! They make the best sex!!!!My Daisy:\nBut I don't love you, Daisy, and you can't begin to know how sorry I am about that because if I could choose anyone in this world to love, it'd be you.\nEven though Alex is trying to make Daisy give up, she won\u2019t. She is stubborn and strong. Daisy is all heart. She might have a spoiled side, but when she loves, she loves with everything she\u2019s got. She forms an attachment to the circus animals, and to say that the attachment is endearing would be an understatement. The way SEP writes these animals captivated me.\nLike the circus animals, she was held captive against her will, and, like them, her keeper had all the power.\n\nShe was in a warm elephant cave. She pressed her cheek to his scratchy, gunnysack body just between his legs and heard the strong thud of his sweet, mischievous heart. She knew she should move, but even though she was resting beneath a ton of baby elephant, she had never felt safer. As she sat there, she thought of Alex and wished he were small enough to fit where she was, right beneath Tater's heart.\nSEP has a talent for writing a complete, no-page-unturned, no-character-left-behind story. She always includes a full story of the B characters, and I always love it. She gives everyone an HEA. Here are a couple of the B characters that I loved.Sheba is the circus owner. She is hard-headed, stubborn, prideful\u2026.a bitch. She cares for the circus and the people in the circus with everything she\u2019s got\u2026except for Daisy, which makes it interesting. I can\u2019t help but love her.My Sheba:Heather is a teenage girl caught in the middle of growing up. She is trying to earn the love of her father by trying her best to be a good circus performer. She plays a key role in the story, and forms an attachment to Daisy.My Heather:Note to Susan: Dear Susan,Cheers. Cheers to this book. Cheers this story. Cheers these characters. Cheers to YOU.This book is officially in my top 3 favorites SEP books. This is a must-read. This is a re-read. Read it."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6010839-lisa", "userReview": "Kiss an Angel was my first Susan Elizabeth Phillips book and it may be my last. I am usually pretty easy to please when it comes to what I choose to read. I don\u2019t often dislike books that I read. Further, I really hate it when a book rubs me the wrong way. Alas, that is what happened with this book. I did not connect with either the hero or the heroine and I came away from reading the story not liking either character very much. I realize that I am in the minority when it comes to my opinion regarding this book. I will state that I respect all the great reviews out there and by no means do not take my review as a reason to not give this book a go. Kiss an Angel was just not the book for me.Let us meet Daisy Devreaux. She has led a charmed and carefree life where she has been spoiled and sheltered. She definitely comes across as an airhead and a simpleton. Daisy is blindly optimistic about every situation, sometimes to the point of foolishness. She is full of optimism, love, bubbles and sunshine.\n\u201cShe (Daisy) dug her nails into her palms and told herself she had no choice. \"I, Theodosia...\" She gulped for air. \"...take thee Alexander...\" She gulped again. \"...to be my awful wedded husband...\u201d\nNow, let\u2019s meet Mr. Condescending, Alex Markov. He is intense and most people give him wide berth. Alex is definitely not a man who seems easy to get along with. I found him mean, condescending and moody.\n\u201cI told you from the beginning how this was going to be. I don\u2019t respect you \u2013 I don\u2019t even like you very much \u2013 and I sure as hell don\u2019t have any intention of playing the bridegroom.\u201d\nThis tale begins at the nuptials between Daisy and Alex, both individuals being forced into the marriage. Daisy was foolishly irresponsible upon the death of her mother and spent away any money left by her mother until the debts piled up so high that creditors were after her. Her father, the wonderful man that he is (*sarcasm*), gave her two choices: she could either go to jail or marry Alex Markov. As for Alex, he was indebted to Daisy\u2019s father and the marriage arrangement was the hefty price he was paying in to order to even things out with his debtor. The \u201carrangement\u201d was for Alex and Daisy to remain married for six months. Alex was left with the charge of taming the simpleton and introducing her to the real world while Daisy was to stick it out for the full amount of time if she ever wanted to see another penny from her father. It was a recipe for disaster from the start.So, Alex takes Daisy with him to the circus....yes, that\u2019s right....the circus. This part I actually found very enjoyable. He is a performer and a manager for the Quest Brothers Circus and introduces Daisy to this rough world fully expecting the dim-wit to run for the hills once she got a taste of the life. Daisy surprises everyone when she rises to the challenges set before her. She is determined to prove something and stupidly is determined to make her sham of a marriage work. Ok, I was fine everything up until this point. Yes, Daisy and Alex were irritating but I fully expected to warm up to them.That did not happen. I usually love innocent and sweet heroines but Daisy just rubbed me the wrong way. I am not sure I can even pin point the specifics that attributed to my feelings towards her. I understand that the author was trying to make Daisy out as a sweet girl who wins the boy with her unconditional love and determined demeanour. That did not work for me. I hated how she just allowed Alex to treat her like crap and walk all over her. She never stood up for herself, specifically when she was accused of a \u201ccrime\u201d and it was something she was punished for. I never felt that she had the upper hand at all expect maybe towards the end. I also hated the fact that she was so determined to make something of her relationship with Alex when he was such an ass-hat to her. I did not find it believable that even an airhead would want to continue to be in a marriage with someone who treated them so wrongly and unjustly. I really disliked Alex for the majority of the book and by the time he actually did something self-less and sweet (at the 80% mark!), I simply held no more compassion for him and could not muster up enough energy to care about his redemption. Alex was rude, domineering, arrogant and an ass. I want to explain that I usually have no issues with these types of males. I actually usually like to read about an alpha jerk. However, what bothered me the most about Alex is that I felt he was so condescending, mean and haughty. He was just too irritating and insufferable for me. No amount of time would have redeemed him in my eyes. Perhaps if we saw more glimpses of his humanity earlier on in the storyline I would have been able to come around and forgive him. That did not happen, at least not for me.My intention is not to turn off anyone from reading Kiss an Angel. I am just expressing my opinion, which again is in the minority. If you have not read this book, give it a chance. You may end up discovering a story that is very enjoyable. There was some humour that had me laughing but it simply did not make up for my dislike of both the main characters.That is all."}, {"userName": "valee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2320890-valee", "userReview": "Do you know that feeling when you have just finished a book you adored but you just can't figure out how to express that on your review? Well that's exactly what happened to me but I'll do my best to try to explain it to you all.This was my favorite book from this author, I even liked it more than the Chicago stars series and I already had adored that one, I gave 5 stars to most of the books in it. But it was so different this time. I couldn't put the book down, that's how FREAKING amazing it was for me. I loved this book so much. I even cried like a baby with it. My heart felt like it would break into a million pieces more than once, while some other times I felt like I would go crazy for feeling so happy about fictional characters, lol, but seriously I totally connected with them.In this book we get to meet Alex, our sexy Russian hero. He was so lost and suffering so much through life without even realizing it. He had been abused by his uncle as a child (by being knocked down and brutalized) and was sure he just wasn't able to love anyone or anything. It's not like he had not tried, he had, but he thought he could never get to love someone, that he was broken inside. It was so heartbreaking to see how he could not accept so many great things that started to happen to him but at the same time it was so emotional to see him accepting them at the end. He was the best part of the book IMHO. The rest of the characters were amazing as well. So be ready for a great ride with this book because you'll experience tons of emotions in just a couple of hundred of pages,lol.I just can't understand how this author keeps surprising me this way. I'm so obsessed with her right now! Its like every new book I read from her is even better than the last one. I never thought I would like Contemporary romance but I know I do now. Can't wait to read another book from this author, I just can't get enough."}, {"userName": "\u25c6 Anna's \u01a6\u00aa\u03fb\u0181\u2113\u2139\u057cg$ \u25c6", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22324639-anna-s-g", "userReview": "[none (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Val \u2693\ufe0f Shameless \u2693\ufe0f Steamy Reads", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11626803-val-shameless-steamy-reads", "userReview": "I can't believe I'm about to read this because I LOATHE everything about the circus and I usually avoid any books involving them.

Me ha hecho re\u00edr, emocionarme (la mayor parte del tiempo), suspirar totalmente embelesada por esas escenas tan preciosas llenas de amor y por esos dos protagonistas tan inolvidables. \u00c9l, Alex, muy duro, serio y lleno de secretos, con un pasado oscuro que lo ha convertido en el hombre que es hoy d\u00eda, un hombre que no ha conocido ni el amor ni el cari\u00f1o. Ella, Daisy, una joven mimada, aparentemente superficial y caprichosa, que tampoco ha conocido el amor de primera mano, pero que en realidad esconde un coraz\u00f3n demasiado grande, dulce y sensible.La relaci\u00f3n entre ellos es fascinante. Resulta muy divertido y atrapante de leer cuando los protagonistas comienzan llev\u00e1ndose muy mal y se odian pr\u00e1cticamente, para luego ver como cada uno saca lo mejor del otro y el amor va surgiendo muy lentamente. Algo que me encant\u00f3 de esta pareja es la qu\u00edmica que va naciendo entre ellos: las escenas rom\u00e1nticas est\u00e1n cargadas de erotismo y sensualidad. Son muy apasionados y hacen algunos juegos y travesuras que te tienen pegada a las p\u00e1ginas mientras re\u00eds con sus ocurrencias. Ador\u00e9 a estos dos chicos, la lengua filosa que tienen ambos, su car\u00e1cter y los momentos entre ellos que son pura explosi\u00f3n.Es una historia de amor preciosa, con partes bien dram\u00e1ticas, dolorosas y emotivas as\u00ed como otras que te hacen morir de risa, muy divertidas y geniales. Su historia de amor surge poco a poco y concluye de la mejor manera posible. Un final precioso que le hace justicia a ambos y que claramente se merecen al haber pasado por tantos momentos dolorosos, los cuales son los culpables de haberme pasado casi toda la lectura con la lagrimilla en el ojo (aunque tambi\u00e9n tengo que decir que en alguna ocasi\u00f3n ha sido de alegr\u00eda).Cuando un libro me llega tant\u00edsimo como es el caso, me es dif\u00edcil expresarlo. Y es que Besar a un \u00e1ngel ha sido un c\u00famulo de situaciones que me han fascinado. Para m\u00ed es novedoso el ambiente que rodea al mundo circense, la trama en general, las situaciones que se dan a lo largo de la historia (unas tan preciosas y otras tan dolorosas y tristes)... En fin, todo lo que rodea a Alex y Daisy, me ha maravillado por completo. Es una historia que merece ser le\u00edda, tan demasiado emotiva y rom\u00e1ntica que se hace memorable."}, {"userName": "UniquelyMoi ~ BlithelyBookish", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1113032-uniquelymoi-blithelybookish", "userReview": "5 beautiful, brilliant stars!\u201cDon't dare a person who has nothing else left to lose.\u201d It's official!

I didn't just love this book; I'm in love with it!!Admittedly when I started to read this I thought this was not going to work for me. Boy was I ever wrong!!! Even with the over-the-top unrealistic circumstances that surrounded the characters, this book STOLE MY HEART!! Daisy, oh my goodness, talk about wearing your heart on your sleeve, she did everything\u2026 everything out of love!! She was one of the sweetest, kindest, most determined heroines I've ever had the good fortune to come across! I adored her, and just thinking about her now just warms my heart. Thrown into circumstances she's totally unprepared for, Daisy makes the best of the situation. She finds herself married to the cold-hearted, yet devastatingly handsome Alexander Markov. He throws every obstacle he can at her, but she is determined, keeps her chin up and pushes through. I was fascinated by her, she was delightful! I did not like Alex at first, but as Daisy works her magic and he starts to come around, she falls for him and so did I. Alex was carrying around some heavy baggage and he built a fortress around himself and his heart, but Daisy is so damn irresistible that his walls begin to crumble ever so slowly. He puts up a great front, but the reader can feel how much he cares for this woman who shares his bed and his life. The deal for the marriage calls for 6 months, but how can he ever let her go?! Her father and step-mother, I don\u2019t even want to talk about them, they\u2019re not worth the effort\u2026BLECH!Hear that crack?!?! It\u2019s my heart breaking in half and it wasn\u2019t the only thing cracking and well\u2026you\u2019ll just have to read it and see for yourself!! OMG\u2026even now it all just takes my breath away, my heart pounds and I\u2019m anxious all over again. It was a defining moment in the book and I can\u2019t say any more than that! The ending took me totally off guard. I never expected it to play out the way it did. It was such a pleasant surprise, my jaw just dropped to the floor and it took a while for me to lift it up and put it back in place. I read the last 12% of this book over and over\u2026I had a hard time putting this one away. So many amazing characters that took front and center, but the two that stole the show were Sinjun and Tater! Their special relationship with Daisy, well it was just that\u2026SPECIAL! However unrealistic it was, it worked in a big way. So much fun, SEP outdid herself with this one. This book stirred every emotion in me\u2026it was head-spinning! The dialogue was amazing; I was captivated by the story and charmed by all the characters, especially Daisy and Alex. The passion they shared felt real and they had amazing chemistry. SEP does intimate very well. The book was not lacking for heat, that\u2019s for sure. \nKiss An Angel \nis now a comfort read on my shelf; I can pull this out anytime and know that it will leave me feeling good, and that\u2019s saying something!!! I can\u2019t recommend this book enough!"}, {"userName": "In\u00e9s Izal", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25759167-in-s-izal", "userReview": "Doy gracias a Dios por habernos dado a SEP y que esta nos haya regalado este libro.No s\u00e9 las veces que lo habr\u00e9 rele\u00eddo, pero siempre me emociona y conquista en las mismas partes.\u201c-Esta noche no, Daisy.

Theodosia (Daisy), la protagonista me enamoro su personalidad y adem\u00e1s me identifique mucho con su necedad, errores y temor por los animales.Alex, OMG es uno de esos protagonistas que te enamoran por completo, es atractivo, de descendencia Rusa y con una gran habilidad con el l\u00e1tigo. No dir\u00e9 mucho de lo que trata, porque lo que m\u00e1s disfrute fue lo inesperado, el no saber hacia d\u00f3nde se dirig\u00eda la historia. Lo mejor del libro es que se desarrolla en un Circo. Y como es contado en tercera persona, la autora nos muestra mucho de c\u00f3mo es la vida en este ambiente. Un libro muy recomendable de Amor, rom\u00e1ntico pero no clich\u00e9 empalagoso. Es simplemente lindo y f\u00e1cil de leer. Ame este libro por completo, esta fue mi cara todo el tiempo mientras lo leia."}, {"userName": "Patry Fernandez", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21837756-patry-fernandez", "userReview": "RELECTURA: 01/02/2017No importa las veces que lea este libro (ya perd\u00ed la cuenta) pero siempre consigue enamorarme y hacerme disfrutar de esta preciosa historia.

Now that I have read and loved enough of her books I have put her on the dreaded author pedestal. I know I shouldn\u2019t but I have and thankfully I absolutely adored Kiss an Angel from start to finish. I won\u2019t go on and on about the characters or the plot simply because there are a few FANTASTIC reviews written by Karen, Angela and Ingela that you must check out if you haven\u2019t already. Their words are spot on and their pictures capture some of my favorite moments in the book too.But I will say\u2026..The two main characters Daisy and Alex were pretty amazing. The moments between them were endless. There was humor, sweetness and sexiness. \u2764 And one thing I always love about SEP books are the side story and side characters. In this one, SEP had me falling for a baby elephant named Tater and a Siberian Tiger named Sinjun. The plot was creative and filled with SEP originality. The candidness of the dialogue was perfect. It provided for laughter, romance and endless sexual tension. Which I must say I loved! As the story starts to peak I found myself completely invested in not only Daisy and Alex\u2019s love story but the relationships of the others characters. It really was a wonderful story.While my favorite SEP books are her Chicago Star\u2019s Series, I highly recommend this one too!"}, {"userName": "Geo Marcovici", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36316784-geo-marcovici", "userReview": "M\u0103 bucur c\u0103 am cedat presiunii prietenelor mele Dana \u0219i Tyna \u0219i am f\u0103cut cuno\u0219tin\u021b\u0103 cu aceast\u0103 autoare.

In love... In this wonderful story. Therefore, this is an exuberant, completely one-sided tribute review and must be read with an ounce of sanity. Because I never want to stop and will say again and again in different ways how much I love this book. Please be patient!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWelcome to the Circus!\n\n\n\nI just want to scream - What a great novel!! I'm so impressed, almost 20 years old (written 1996) but it outperforms most in the genre even though it is in a traditional romance style. Maybe nothing new under the sun but in this case it doesn't hurt. I don't think you get a story who is in anyway hyped, vulgar, to sugar sweet or overly fuss to keep us, the readers, on the rack - you just get a good well thought out story. Sure it's steamy with a very hot, handsome alpha hero (Alex, you are a favorite!). There is both happiness, tears, laughter but above all an absolutely incredible wonderful heroine in the lovely Daisy (an angel is really the right term). When it comes down to it, it's mostly novels with a heroine I really can love who will also be the most memorable in the long run. No doubt; highest rating!\u2018She dug her nails into her palms and told herself she had no choice. \"I, Theodosia...\" She gulped for air. \"...take thee Alexander...\" She gulped again. \"...to be my awful wedded husband...\u201d Daisy Devreaux can either go to jail or marry Alex Markov, the man her father has chosen for her. Arranged marriages in a contemporary romance? Yes, poor Daisy have debts and her father has a condition to help her. She, his daughter, must be married to, and live as wife, with the stranger man her father picked out in six months. When the time has elapsed, they may go separate paths and Daisy will get access to a trust fund and can choose how she wants to live her life. What do you do as a 26 year old woman with debt and without a job? - folds up to fate...\u201cDon't dare a person who has nothing else left to lose.\u201d \nJust a few minutes after the wedding drags Daisy from her NY life to the airport. A few hours later, they're in Florida and she faces that her new married life to a stranger is going to be with a traveling second class circus. Her new husband is nasty, lasting, superior and menacing and is pointing to a mangy old-fashioned caravan; her new home. As if that were not bad enough, Daisy is terrified of animals...\u201cWell alright then,\" His eyes glittered. \"I get my kicks whipping woman I have sex with and you're next on my list. Now I'm going to take a shower.\u201d ~ ~ \u201cWhat are you gonna do, angel face? Stab me with your eyebrow pencil?\u201d There is so much to tell. Here are a lot of lovely second characters and their stories. We have the charmer Brady, the bitter but so tough Sheba and the young insecure teenager Heather. It is whining whips, horse arts and one for me quite new and unknown circus world. It's humble, lives in mobile homes, muddy, constant travel, much gossip and bullshit, but also caring and warmth.\n\u2018... the troublesome baby elepahant, the shy gorilla, the old, reagal tiger.\u2019Very important was also all the animals. Tater the baby elephant in love, Glenna a lonely female gorilla and of course the poor old \"talking\" tiger Sinjun. Animals in cramped cages and with rather dire living conditions which Daisy came to take care of and started to love. I really liked that part of the story and I'm barely even an animal lover. But above all it was the love. The love between two very different people, with different backgrounds and ways to show emotions. One gave us everything. Her heart was open to everybody, animals like humans. The other one had long since lost his. He could no longer love. First there was wrangling, viciousness, fuss and digs. Then came the attraction and heat. Then acceptens, friendship - but could it be love? Sometimes I was so mad at Alex. He was so unfair, stubborn and stuck in his old beliefs. I almost cried after getting this three so, by me and by Daisy, awaited and needed beautiful words. I Love You. ...just say them, please.\n\n\nMy heart hoped, was torn apart, healed and became contented. It was an ordeal to get through. But a good one which was awarded.\u201cYou foolish man. Of course there's love. Don't you know? I love you.\u201d As you already understood; I LOVED it. I loved Daisy and Alex, their grand lovestory, their friends and all the cute animals in the circus. Yes the whole thing! Beautifully told, entertaining, very funny and enjoyable to read and of course super romantic. There are good and there are better novels - GREAT novels. This book definitely belongs to the group for the better, the great ones. For me is it unforgettable one. A story I know I will read again.... and that doesn't happen every day.

I am aware this is a rather widely beloved classic of the genre and of her backlist, and I can even see why to a certain extent, but I guess I'll have to take my turn at \"unpopular opinion time\" in this case. There are copious great reviews already covering both ends of the scale, so I won't delve into the plot and details and just explain why this story really didn't work for me.Despite being a vintage release (1996), the narrative style was crisp and engaging as ever, the dialogues infused with humour and, like the lovely Heaven, Texas and Lady Be Good, written around the same years, the book didn't feel dated at all in that regard. My gripes stem from elsewhere, namely the over-the-top storyline and, even more so, the romance between the leads, Daisy Devreaux and Alex Markov. In fact, I couldn't stand Alex, right from the beginning to the very end. There, I said it.When encountering such exceptionally good writing, I usually tend to have more patience with overdone characterisations and circumstances, but this time the outlandish premise set in motion by Daisy's hateful father and the hero's retrograde attitude were just too much to pass. Alex belongs to an old-school bodice ripper, possibly taking place no later than the 18th Century (hey, some of those Victorian guys could be very forward-thinking compared to our hero here!), but in a contemporary context his arrogant behaviour toward a woman who has done him absolutely no wrong to boot, felt so irritating and off-putting as to ruin my whole reading experience. His troubled past is no excuse and till the very last page he acted as if he knew what was best for Daisy in a selfish and dramatic attempt to clean his conscience instead. As for Daisy, while spending entire portions of the book alternatively being overwhelmed by him or justifying his actions, she crossed the line between \"accommodating\" and \"doormat\" one time too many, and her naively cheerful disposition more often than not seemed like passivity covered by a thick layer of forced optimism, a type of heroine I'm totally incapable to relate to.At the end she sounded so drained and resigned, like anybody would if put through the emotional wringer by an uncaring partner, that letting the self-important windbag have his way and shut up and be done with it started to look like an option. Not my idea of romance at all.The itinerant circus setting was well-portrayed and original, but even the secondary characters were mostly exaggerated stereotypes, like Sheba, the \"strong\" woman of the situation, and the quasi-preternatural connection Daisy develops with some animals further detracted from my enjoyment, since I usually don't care for unexpected paranormal abilities popping up to show a character's specialness in what is initially presented as a realistic background, especially when contemporary.If I don't regret having read this book, for the always delicious writing, the fast moving plot and a little bit for having finally slaked my curiosity, I can't see myself picking it up ever again, nor would I recommend beginning one's acquaintance with SEP's oeuvre from here. At the risk of repeating myself always bringing him up as an absolute paragon, Heath, the hero from her irresistible Match Me If You Can, is worth ten Alex Markovs (and maybe some more)."}, {"userName": "V.

Its a beautiful love story with a strong cast of characters, each playing a vital role to make this story a worthwhile read.Alex Markov was rescued by Daisy\u2019s father Max when he was twelve years old from the constant physical abuse he was facing under his uncle Sergey. Max had bought Alex from his uncle and seen to his education. Alex had shaped into a cold, aloof man who has a strong sense of honor and pride which he holds onto with his life.Daisy is the direct opposite of Alex. An illegitimate child, the only mistake her diplomat father had made in his entire life, Daisy had lived her whole life trying to gain the approval of a father who has never really seen what a remarkable woman Daisy had turned into, regardless of the promiscuous lifestyle Daisy\u2019s beautiful mother had subjected her to. Vulnerable, kind and easy going to a fault, Daisy\u2019s father considers her to be a fluffy scatterbrained individual whom he arranges to be married to Alex for a period of six months. Broke without a dollar to her name, Daisy has no choice but to go ahead with the marriage or face prison for maxing out her credit cards and finding all the creditors after her, the result of shopping extravagantly to make up for the profound sense of loneliness she has been feeling since her mother died.Alex thinks no better of Daisy than her father and vows to give her a fair chance to work through the temporary arrangement which Alex has agreed to with Max. Alex introduces Daisy to the life of living and working in a circus, and for someone like Daisy who has a perpetual fear of animals this doesn\u2019t prove to be an easy feat. With a husband who doesn\u2019t want to have to do anything with her except grudgingly acknowledge the intense feelings of passion that Daisy is able to arouse in him, Daisy finds herself unprepared for what is about to hit her.Alex doesn\u2019t trust his wife one bit and when she is framed as a thief, Alex serves her with the sentence of cleaning up the muck of the animal stalls at the circus. Daisy proves she has a backbone of steel when with determination she surpasses everyone\u2019s expectations of her by sticking to her punishment regardless of the fact she is innocent of the crime.Regardless of the cold layer of indifference Alex tries to put up with, he soon finds himself intrigued with his new wife, whilst Daisy slowly teaches Alex how to care, love and share with his better half.Things get interesting when Daisy gets pregnant, something which Alex had made Daisy swear she would take all the necessary precautions against. In a moment of anger, Alex loses the woman he only realizes too late that he has fallen for, and the lengths Alex has to go through to win Daisy\u2019s love back would touch any romantics heart.The author is known for her talent in weaving a romantic tale filled with laugh aloud moments together with moments of intense passion that makes this book one worth re-reading from time to time. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance.

Yes alot of parts pissed me off but I was always feeling something so that's why I gave it 4 stars. Even when she was sleeping with the tiger I was so moved!
