I had a fantastic time reading this story; the book is written in such an easy, readable manner, yet the story is a complex web of suspense, emotion, and deceit. The amount of effort behind such a flawless execution must have been immensely time consuming and brain melting; however, anyone who follows McKenzie knows how insanely brilliant and talented she is, resulting in pulling off a book that few could accomplish. Fractured is one of those books that doesn't easily fit in one genre; yes it is a mysterious and suspenseful tale to boot, but it is equal parts domestic fiction brimming with emotion and appeal to all genders.The mystery aspect had me completely fooled. I thought I knew where it was going and that I had it figured out but I was wrong. There's no greater pleasure for me in reading a mystery than when I've been duped and this gave me those feelings galore. At last count I've read 214 books in 2016, and I'd say about 70% of those would fall in the mystery/thriller/suspense category. This is in the maybe 10% that I didn't have figured out before the big reveal. I think this alone proves that McKenzie is a seasoned writer who knows how to fool her readers, even those who are proficient in the genre and become wary of books claiming to give the reader a good twist but utterly disappoint in the end.I also really enjoyed the layers and depth the author gave to her characters. The sole focus of the book isn't on any one aspect, so for me I found reading about the personal, dramatic relationships between characters just as enjoyable as the suspenseful scenes revolving around the mystery. My only complaint (and one only based on personal tastes, not quality of writing) was that I felt a few sections could have been shaved down a bit. If the page count had been lowered by 30-40 pages, I think this would have been a full 5 star read for me. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to mystery and fiction lovers alike. This is a rare instance where you find a compelling mystery and fleshed out characters in one book! I find it rare that a writer doesn't sacrifice one or the other in their tales, but Catherine has managed to include both, making this one of my favorite winter reads. Get your hands on this one; you don't want to miss out! As if she wasn't enough of a winner, the author has also published a companion novel as mentioned in the details above from the perspective of her main character Julie; this book is \"the book\" discussed in Fractured and I can't wait to pick it up as well to complete my reading experience!*I'd like to thank the author and publisher for my copy; it was a pleasure to provide an honest review in return."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9684061-melissa", "userReview": "4.5 starsEvery time I pick up a new book, I\u2019m hoping for an experience like this one. The clever plot, the mixed bag of characters and the frantic need for the truth, had me turning the pages at a rapid pace. It was exciting. Addicting. Unputdownable. I loved the entire premise of the story. Julie, an author that's penned a popular bestseller, relocates with her family to a picturesque neighborhood in Cincinnati. Being in her head and seeing her writing process was so interesting to me. I always imagined that people who were meant to be writers could just sit down and let the words flow. It's nice to get a dose of reality - it isn't easy for anyone. Anyway, back to Julie. This is her chance to start over and crank out book number two. To leave behind the constant fear brought on by her very own stalker. Or is it?\nWhen do you cross the line from curious to obsessed? From fan to fanatic? Compliment to threat?\nWhat she doesn\u2019t expect is to connect with the married man across the street. Or for her new neighbors to turn on her after a few mishaps. The neighborhood is rampant with gossip, ridiculous bylaws and nosiness. I would\u2019ve packed up my family and gotten the heck out of there.\nClose neighbors make good neighbors!\nThe way the author tells the story is engaging. She switches between the past and present, from the perspective of Julie to the husband from across the street, all while leading up to the major incident that essentially changes everything. Did something happen to Julie or was she responsible? Did her stalker track her down or was it someone living much closer? I had my theories, ideas about how things were going to play out, but I missed the mark. Which only made the story that much more enjoyable. I love when I'm wrong.There are a ton of twists and turns and even a companion book. One I\u2019m incredibly excited to read. \u201cThe Book\u201d that Julie Apple wrote is actually a real book being released by Ms. McKenzie.

This book sucked me in from the very beginning..... told from dual viewpoints... Julie a successful author who moved her family across the country to avoid a stalker.... and John the husband and father who lives across the street, who might be a little too interested..... it is also told from different time periods... from before the incident... and after the incident... the incident that changed everything... the incident that you don\u2019t have any idea of what it is until very late in the book... did Julie get killed? Did Julie cause something to happen? Or did it have to do with somebody else? These are questions I asked myself throughout this book....This book had such lively and well developed characters... in particular Julie, the author trying to get that second book written after the amazing success of her first novel.... the first book that was said to have been loosely based on real life events, but how close is reality and fiction? And now that Julie has moved across the country to escape her stalker has she just found herself in the middle of another nightmare? The nosiest neighborhood ever? Throughout this book there were exerts from the neighborhood newsletter that were downright hilarious and over-the-top! (Well they were hilarious if you didn\u2019t live in that neighborhood)So as I said this book sucked me in and I literally stayed up all night reading and then at about 85%...... when things started getting revealed, I was like did I miss something? This book was way too amazing to end like this.... I was expecting a firework show and I got a sparkler(Just one sparkler) that\u2019s not to say I hated the ending... I was just expecting so much more.... it was a nice pleasant happy ending.... but I guess I didn\u2019t want nice, pleasant,and happy.... I wanted fireworks!I would absolutely recommend this book, it was a fabulous page turner, the ending just was a little lackluster... but the book as a whole was wonderful!~~~ interesting note you can also read a copy of Julie\u2019s first best-selling book \nJulie AppleBrilliant right?

Pine Street in Cincinnati is run by one woman, Cindy Sutton, and it has become her own private fiefdom with many rules and regulations to follow. She constantly sends emails to all the neighbours on a regular basis with some serious guidelines to follow which seem to become more outrageous as time goes by. There are several other captivating main characters besides quirky Cindy. Fearing a stalker from her past, Julie Prentice has recently moved in with her husband Daniel and two children, unaware that the neighbour across the road, John Dunbar has taken a keen interest in her. He cautiously peeks out from the lacy curtains every morning waiting for Julie to start her early run so he can join her hoping his wife doesn\u2019t catch on to what he\u2019s up to. The plot builds slowly with each chapter creating tension with a splash of edginess thrown in.

Julie Prentice and her family arrive in a seemingly bucolic community tucked in the corner of Cincinnati, hoping to put their past behind them. Having fled Tacoma because of a stalker, the Prentices hope to hit the proverbial reset button on Pine Street. Greeted with a welcome basket and note from Cindy Sutton, the self-proclaimed Chair of the Pine Street Neighborhood Association. (PSNA), Julie and her family soon realise that this is not the laid-back row of houses with picket fences for which they were searching. As a full-time writer, Julie is home all day, alone while her husband and children attend work and school. In the early stages, her only social interactions are with John Dunbar, the neighbour with whom she runs early mornings. This fitness regimen soon blossoms into a friendship, where they can swap ideas and complain about the mind-numbing and fascist ways Chairperson Cindy seeks to regulate every aspect of the Pine Street community, down to pet walking and suggested curfews for those with children under 17 years of age. When John loses his job, he ends up spending more time at home, which offers Julie the chance for more time around her neighbour. An IT specialist, John soon notices some weakness in Julie's computer network and offers to assist. This seemingly innocent act sticks in the craw of the reader, who is fully aware of the stalker situation that has pushed the Prentices to Ohio. While she is proud of her first novel, The Murder Game, Julie is torn about admitting who she is to those around her, though her secret is soon revealed in one of the weekly PSNA e-newsletters. As John grows closer to Julie, the latter continues to make a bad impression on most of her neighbours, particularly Cindy and John's wife, Hanna. As the story unfolds, McKenzie takes the reader through an ever-advancing timeline, a twelve-month arc, where an event has occurred, vaguely defined but that is fleshed-out as the narrative advances; something so horrid that no one wishes to mention it other than to call it 'the accident' but that also requires legal intervention. As Julie alienates herself from the neighbours and must sever ties with John for reasons of marital stability, she finds herself feeling more isolated than ever before, which creates a feeling of instability and heightens her sense of vulnerability. This is exacerbated as new actions and events occur around her home. Has Julie's previous stalker returned, or are the neighbours trying to drive her off Pine Street? All this, and the elusive 'accident' to which McKenzie refers as she advances the plot, keeps the readers guessing until the last sentence. A well-crafted piece of fiction that will keep readers guessing, wondering, and hoping as the peaks and valleys of the non-linear plot develop. This is the first novel of Catherine McKenzie's that I have read and I am kicking myself for waiting so long. When I received an advance copy of her next book (read on to see how it ties in), I thought I ought to begin here, laying the groundwork to better understand the author and her writing style. McKenzie shows that she is able to create wonderful characters, all of whom are believable and varied, which caters to the vast array of readers who will pick up this book. The plot is wonderfully paced and, while it advances over a year, it is peppered with flash-forwards to the present, which deal with a vague and somewhat opaque legal issue that has a number of the characters testifying before a grand jury. McKenzie uses the interesting technique not only of segmenting events in month-long chapters, but also by handing the narrative voice to a few key characters, Julie Prentice and John Dunbar. This allows the reader to feel a stronger connection to these protagonists, rather than a beige omnipresent narrator who can only present superficial thought processes. Of greatest interest is the novel for which Julie 'Apple' Prentice is so well-known. Its plot is hinted at throughout and the eventual dust jacket summary appears in an early chapter. Whether this is based on an event from Julie's time in law school remains unknown, though McKenzie does offer the backstory of a friend's death in Julie's student days. The Murder Game, this blockbuster story hinted at in this novel is the next published work that McKenzie will release in the coming weeks (and the book I mentioned above that NetGalley has offered me). So, while there will be little to resolve the cliffhangers or ideas that fall within this novel, The Murder Game might pave the way towards better understanding Julie Prentice and some of the characteristics she presents in this McKenzie novel. Why not read The Murder Game first, as it stands two years before the happenings of this novel? I thought I ought to check out all the hype and discover how lured in I would get, then see if I can create some 'aha!' moments for myself by reading the Apple novel. Bring on 'The Book' as Julie calls it, which I am sure will be stellar, as it is sure to hold McKenzie's powerful writing punch. I might, however, need a night to pick my jaw up from off the floor, as I remain amazed at how drawn I was to all aspects of this story.Kudos, Madam McKenzie for this stellar piece of work. How have I not known about you for all these years? I won't lament it and be glad I did. Now then, The Murder Game awaits!Like/hate the review?

Julie Apple is an author who was being stalked by a reader of her first novel. She and her family move to a tight knit neighbourhood in Cincinnati where they hope to find some peace and get away from the stalker. But the neighbourhood has its own issues, and it turns out to be harder than expected for Julie to shake off her past. What makes this one a page turner is the structure. The story is told from the alternating points of view of Julie and her neighbour John. It also goes back and forth in time over a one year period, letting the reader know that something bad happens at the end, but exactly what that event is does not get revealed until the last few pages. It\u2019s a tangled web that comes into focus at the end. This is not a book made up of likable characters; rather, the ground feels like it keeps shifting, and it\u2019s never clear who can be trusted and whether anyone\u2019s motivations are straightforward. I found that there was a bit too much thrown in at the end, but otherwise I was glad to let McKenzie take me along on this ride. This one seems less literary and more aimed at a mass market than McKenzie\u2019s earlier books. But she pulls it off, and I would be happy to read her books in the future. In fact, it looks like Mckenzie has written another book -- The Murder Game -- to be published soon under the pseudonym Julie Apple which is meant to be the book that triggered Julie\u2019s stalker. This seems a bit hokey, but has me curious enough to want to give it a try.

Cindy Sutton, self-appointed neighborhood watch coordinator, makes and modifies the neighborhood rules and thereby sets off the many events that suddenly unfold.Julie, unnerved by Heather, is in need of friendship. Someone has tried to access her account from an unusual IP address and location. Julie is depressive and has had bouts with alcohol. Is Julie the architect of her own difficulties?John Dunbar lives across the street from Julie Prentice. John, having lost his IT job has time on his hands. He becomes Julie's morning running partner and computer expert. The magnetism between them sets off a series of tragic and unforeseen misfortunes.Using a non-linear timeline and the voices of Julie and John we learn about \"the accident\" that occurs in the so-called \"tightly knit\" community of close neighbors. Assumptions about the Prentice family cloud the judgement of the residents. Is Julie's tome \"The Murder Game\" based upon her experiences? After all, shouldn't writers write about what they know?\"Fractured\" by Catherine McKenzie is a suspenseful, page turning mystery with many twists. The story is told in alternating voices. The author, by contrasting the writing techniques of present day and flashback keeps the reader guessing. The ending is a surprise. McKenzie has released \"The Murder Game\", a companion book written under the pseudonym of Julie Apple, this novel's central character. I can't wait to read it! Kudos to Catherine McKenzie.Thank you Lake Union Publishing and Net Galley for the opportunity to read and review \"Fractured\"."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15865336-jan", "userReview": "3.75 starsA bit too many things go wrong for the main protag for me to give this a full 4 star rating, but it's so close! I enjoyed the writing style and there was a good message here that hit close to home for me: There is a fine line between friendships that can easily be crossed and lead into an emotional relationship. These types of relationships are just as harmful, if not more, than physical relationships outside of the marriage. I think the author did a nice job of portraying just how innocently lines can get blurred, but felt the resolution of this could have been addressed better. I'm a bit cool on the ending, but do give credit that the storylines were all resolved. I found I wanted more from all the main characters after the 'big event' happened. It all felt a bit rushed compared to the build up.There is a lot of good here, so I do recommend for all mystery lovers. Told from 2 points of view, bouncing from past to present, it certainly kept me guessing as to what happens, and who was behind it.My thanks to NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz", "userReview": "A mystery writer is forced to move her family to Ohio to escape a stalker after she writes a bestseller. Something happens in the new neighborhood, but we, the readers, aren't privy to that info. The story is told from her perspective along with that of the neighbor across the street, John. It's also told from present day and one year before, when her family first moved in. It teases you, giving you clues piecemeal. It seems this trick of multiple POV and multiple time periods must be the new hot idea. Or am I just picking books that contain both? Sometimes it works better than others. Here, it works. I found the characters well developed and both sides sympathetic. The one character that grates is Cindy Sutton, the self appointed block leader. I kept hoping whatever nasty happened involved her. Well written and fast paced, this book kept me riveted. It\u2019s one of those books you find yourself trying to make time for just one more chapter.

Throughout this story, the two main characters, who alternate points of view, blamed the outcome on mistakes that they made but I, as an outsider, formed a different opinion. I held the entire community responsible, based on their \u201cmob-like\u201d mentality when it came to a newcomer not fitting into their mold.Fractured tells the story of Julie Prentice, new to a close knit neighbourhood in suburbia. She and her family had moved to escape a stalker. As the story began, introducing Julie\u2019s neighbour John Dunbar, I had an inkling of where it was headed. As each chapter passed the how's and whys were slowly filled in and I knew something dark had happened, though I admit to being surprised that I hadn\u2019t correctly figured it all out.Shortly after Julie and her family moved in, paranoia rose in Julie. Her neighbours started ganging up on her in ways I felt were quite unfair and Julie started to doubt everything. Even though half of the story was told from Julie\u2019s point of view, Catherine McKenzie left us in doubt as to what was real and what was not in such a clever way, by having Julie doubt herself. After all, it seemed unlikely that so many people could turn on her for no apparent reason, similar to when her book, \u201cThe Murder Game\u201d came out. But as I mentioned, people can be so cruel and being different is often unforgivable to some.\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s upset and i\u2019m taking her home. You want to play detective to a bunch of unreliable witnesses, you go right ahead.\u201d\nThe mystery did sometimes get in my way while reading this story. I often had to remind myself to slow down and enjoy the story - I was so anxious to see what was going to happen next. It was a real push/pull for me. Julie and John\u2019s growing attachment had warning bells going off in my head all while the story crept towards revealing what the aftermath would bring. I didn\u2019t want to put the book down. I\u2019m being purposely vague so as not to spoil it for those who have not read the story yet.

With alternating timelines and characters POVs, it all gets very exciting. I loved the whole storyline and premise - the author is an excellent a storyteller. I'm not sure, I may be in the minority here, but the ending fell flat for me. I can see how it would be appealing, however (and I say this time and time again) I fall into the trap of wanting twists or a major WOW! moment with my psychological thrillers and this one was relatively straightforward. All in all a great read, I'm looking forward to the reading the main character's \"book\" - what a cool device - to write a book that was supposedly written by one of your characters.

I thought I had the ending pinned for sure and man haha I was totally wrong! And what I REALLY loved is how Catherine actually published \"The book\". Very very clever!!

Unfortunately, she picks an area that takes Neighborhood Watch and community regulations to a whole new level. I kept wondering whether such neighborhoods really exist? I just could not imagine living in such an environment. But anyway, I'm digressing. So, Julie's fresh start soon turns into a bit of a nightmare. But is that simply due to her new neighbors or is there something \"off\" about Julie as well? How much is she to blame for everything that occurs?From the start, the reader is aware that something tragic is going to happen, but Catherine McKenzie keeps the reader guessing to whom, how exactly and who is responsible. While I sometimes find this withholding of information quite annoying, it worked well here. The author did a great job of dropping the odd statement here and there that would make you wonder about different characters' intentions, secrets, and reliability. The alternating first-person perspectives of Julie and John, the married guy from across the road whom Julie befriends, combined with the non-linear time frame worked surprisingly well, and although these two characters had their flaws, I really liked both of them. All the way through, I was trying to predict where the story was heading and even though I amended my theories several times, I was still way off the mark. I love it when that happens. I was getting rather grumpy over the last few days because I couldn't find enough time to read this. I really didn't want to put it down. Well-written, with believable characters and an exciting and clever plot this was a very engaging domestic psychological suspense novel.This was my first book by Catherine McKenzie, but I intend to catch up with her back catalog and am now looking forward to reading The Murder Game, the book that McKenzie's character Julie wrote about committing the perfect murder, and which will be released in November.

It got me all confused, so I'd think I knew who did what, but I was wrong. And I really enjoyed that. Not knowing the truth until the author gave the right clues.\nJulie Prentice and her family move across the country to the idyllic Mount Adams district of Cincinnati, hoping to evade the stalker who\u2019s been terrorizing them ever since the publication of her bestselling novel, The Murder Game. Since Julie doesn\u2019t know anyone in her new town, when she meets her neighbor John Dunbar, their instant connection brings measured hope for a new beginning. But she never imagines that a simple, benign conversation with him could set her life spinning so far off course.After a series of misunderstandings, Julie and her family become the target of increasingly unsettling harassment. Has Julie\u2019s stalker found her, or are her neighbors out to get her, too? As tension in the neighborhood rises, new friends turn into enemies, and the results are deadly.\nThe story is told from both Julie's and John's POVs, and it takes place in both the present and the past. The past is actually a countdown from a year ago. And it is clear right away that something very bad happened. As we read more, we find out that somebody died, and that the Dunbars (or at least one of them) are (is) responsible. So the mystery of the victim and what happens begins. Only this is not the only mystery. There is another one as we keep wondering ourselves what really happened to the victim in The Murder Game. Was she really killed? Did Julie kill her and write about it as fiction afterward? Lord Ruler, did I love not knowing and wondering.And I loved Julie. She's a 42 years old woman with a husband and a pair of twins. She became famous two years prior to the events in Fractured, and was stalked for it. Julie also suffers from depression and has mild issues with alcohol. As a person who's been acquainted with depression for more than three years now, I could relate to her and her problems. And I can tell you Catherine McKenzie does an excellent job at portraying Julie's struggles. The sadness and numbness, both at the same time. The tears that come at the most inappropriate moments. I know them all too well. I also like her husband, Daniel. He's very supportive of her, and I have my very own Daniel at home.As for John, he's also a good person. He's a husband and a father of two teenagers. He recognizes Julie as he's read The Murder Game. Throughout the book he's supportive of Julie, which makes his wife, Hanna, angry. It is true that he feels attracted to his neighbor, but their relationship is exaggerated by the gossip in the neighborhood. Which brings me to Cindy, the self-proclaimed leader of the neighborhood. She represents everything I hate in a woman: meanness, hypocrisy and nosiness. Most of the characters in the book support her and say that she has a good heart, but I fail to see that. She dislikes Julie almost immediately and does her best to shun her. Julie is eventually avenged, but it's bittersweet. I loved the writing style. It flows beautifully, and you just have to read one more chapter. Then one more. And so on until you discover you finished the book.And you know what the best part is? Julie's book, The Murder Game, actually exists. That's just so clever of McKenzie. Bottom line is you need to read Fractured and see for yourself what it's all about. \n*I thank NetGalley, Lake Union Publishing, and Catherine McKenzie for this copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Maxine (Booklover Catlady)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22943325-maxine-booklover-catlady", "userReview": "My actual rating is 3.5 stars for this novel. I just could not quite stretch to 4 stars and had to really have a bit of a think why. Which I will explain in my review. I was eager to read this book, I thought it had some real promise to it with the plot and potential to be a stunner. Whilst an enjoyable read that was not boring it did lack some pizzaz and key moments that could have elevated it to a 4/5 star read. Missed opportunities I would say.An author moves to a new neighbourhood in a new town with her husband and two children. Escaping a slightly tarred past and looking for a fresh new beginning. It's not long before things begin to be a bit sour in the neighbourhood that sees everything and misses nothing (sounded like my worst nightmare of a place to live to be honest). The entire neighbourhood and street has a somewhat dysfunctional amount of interaction and \"rules\" - this is not the place to move to if you want to mind your own business and by anonymous.Through an early decision a course is set that gradually unrolls into a set of really uncomfortable and eventually devastating consequences. It's one of those books that has a slightly apprehensive undercurrent and I was really expecting some shocking, stunning reveals or twists that took my breath away as it was all geared up for them. That's where it underwhelmed me - it wasn't like that at all for me. In fact the lead up to the ending was a let down considering the long build up to it.In saying that however it has a lot of positives - the writing is easy to follow, the characters are well-done and I had many that I liked and many that I did not, I read the book quickly and was not bored or distracted or tempted to lay it to one side. The plot held me enough to keep going to the end and I had so hoped for a really big grand finale but well...it just didn't go there for me.A likeable novel with a lot going for it but I wish the author had pushed out some more wow factor into the plot, the potential to insert that into it is there for the taking. However a book I would recommend and do think it will sit well with a lot of readers. I had just hoped it had offered me that bit more to stretch my rating.

In this novel, an accident happens on a quiet street in the middle of the day, and it leads all the residents to accuse each other and point fingers, blaming others and themselves. The story is not told in order, but in fact it jumps around, from right before the accident, to right after, and back again. I normally do not enjoy this kind of storytelling, but with this novel, it helps build the anticipation and adds to the plot in a pleasant way. McKenzie also adds to the intrigue and mystery by not revealing who the victim of the accident is until the very end, leaving readers guessing throughout the novel. McKenzie\u2019s characters are genuine and (for the most part) likable and relatable (those that aren\u2019t likable, are designed to be that way). Above all else, they are human and sincere, and this is part of what makes the novel great. The plot is plausible- on any neighbourhood, in any city, these events could believably occur\u2014and the dysfunction of the characters add to the honesty. I am always pleased to read any of McKenzie\u2019s novels, and I was happy to receive this one through NetGalley. This novel sticks with you and a reader will definitely hold a personal connection with at least one of the characters.
