That is to say that it has elements of magical realism and cooking but there's something too soft, too milquetoast about it. Everything seems to wrap up too neatly in the end, and despite being about cooking none on the characters have much flavor to them. The \"magic\" here comes from coincidences and the grandmother's fortune telling stones, but again it was really lacking in that department as well.^This is sa cordula, the big hubbub of this book. It was foretold the person who enjoys it will love the MC because it's disgusting. From what I remember, there's some inadvertent hijinks that ensue that lead to the male lead eating it. I'd say *spoiler alert* but you see it coming from a mile away."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100360-jennifer", "userReview": "I always have a hard time reading romances because they tend to be plot driven instead of character driven. This is not one of those occasions. The Love Goddess' Cooking School is a wonderful, romantic Food-Lit and I can't wait to share it. I think Melissa Senate's writing is much like Sarah Addison Allen without the magical realism... and you all know how much I love Sarah Addison Allen.Melissa Senate has created characters that are incredibly easy to identify with - flawed but redeemable. It's been a long time since I read a novel where I felt connected with almost every character. Ms. Senate does an incredible job of making them empathetic. I loved them all. From Liam, the single dad trying to keep his daughter's world from crumbling without her mother, to the recently divorced Simon who is finding his way as a 'weekend dad', to Mia who is trying so hard to figure out where she fits, to Tamara the frustrated serial dater, and Juliet the heartbroken -whose story definitely struck a chord. It's Holly, however with whom I identify the most. Holly can't seem to find a place for herself, falls for the wrong guys, and sometimes sets too much stock in fate and destiny. I love her determination and her desire to see things through. I love that she chose to continue her Nonna's legacy, even though it meant facing her fears and striking out on her own. As I mentioned, this book is not plot driven, but the unfolding of the character's lives pulls the reader through it at a wonderful pace so that I wasn't racing to see what was going to happen next, but enjoying what was happening now. Did I know where the book was headed? Yes. But it was one of those rare times when I wasn't in a hurry to get there. I was just enjoying the world of Blue Crab Island and it's inhabitants. The only thing that seemed a tad out of place were the recipes at the end of the book. Not that they weren't related to the story, they were certainly recipes for the meals made at the cooking school. Perhaps it was because the story was so fabulous, but, in the end, the recipes seemed a little superfluous. I can see not wanting to break the continuity of the story by placing them at the ends of chapters, but I think to be included, they needed to be incorporated into the book somehow because it came off feeling like an afterthought. Though not a bad afterthought and that is only my opinion...I've used the word loved a lot in this post but that's because I thought this book was marvelous - I'm actually running out of synonyms for excellent. This review has been difficult to write because I don't want to gush about it, I'd rather just curl up inside it. It's the perfect balance of love, friendship, and of course, good food. http://girlsjustreading.blogspot.com/..."}, {"userName": "Kerry", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1874367-kerry", "userReview": "There is a genre of books where a group of people (usually women with one lone guy thrown into the mix) gather together in some sort of club or class (knitting, quilting, Jane Austen books or in this case, cooking) and by the end of the book, they have formed close friendships and had a major problem in their lives resolved through the magic of whatever interest had drawn them together in the first place. Sometimes, this genre can produce a good book or even a good series of books (for example - The Elm Creek Quilt series). And sometimes, it can result in books that are a little cotton candy-ish. By that I mean, they are light, fluffy, fun to consume but really don\u2019t have much substance. The Love Goddess\u2019 Cooking School is one of the better examples of the genre. It sort of reminded me of the Friday Night Knitting Club meets the Under the Tuscan Sun (more the film version than the book itself but still) with little hints of Laura Esquivel or Joanne Harris thrown in for flavor. While it does end in the typical \u201ceverything-worked-out and everyone-is-perfectly-matched-up-and-happy\u201d sort of way, it doesn\u2019t cut corners getting there. The characters and the plotlines felt honest and realistic. And while The Love Goddess\u2019 Cooking School will never be considered great literature, it was a fun, easy-going and satisfying read."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1025797-lisa", "userReview": "Good Chick Lit1 lost character named Holly Dash of magical realismAt least one hot guySeveral interesting charactersSecrets, angst and a fun plot to keep readers interestedDelicious recipes to make your mouth water1 wish"}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2161011-pamela", "userReview": "A friend sent me this book in exchange for the Cookbook Collector which I lent to her.

After Nonna's passing, Holly finds herself the proprietress of her business.However, Holly doesn't possess the magic touch that her grandmother had with food and definitely can't see the future.

I have her other books but haven't had a chance to read them yet. I don't think anything was keeping me from reading them, but now that I've finished this book, I definitely will be reading more from Ms. Senate.\"The Love Goddess' Cooking School\" is about Holly, a woman who loses a serious relationship, gets fired from her job and is kicked out of her apartment within a short period of time. She flies across the country, back to her grandmother's home and cooking school in Maine. Her grandmother passes away shortly afterward, leaving her home and cooking school in Holly's care. However, Holly doesn't know how to cook the way her grandmother did. It doesn't help that her grandmother was a fortune teller, a skill that Holly does not possess, which also set a reputation for her with the townsfolk and Holly's own mother. With the help of some new friends, Holly learns how to navigate the world of cooking, teaching and even love in this heartfelt and romantic story.This novel flowed beautifully with a strong female voice, sympathetic characters, delicious sounding food (except for sa cordula, of course) and breathtaking descriptions of an island in Maine. I loved everything about it and had a difficult time putting it down. I stayed up last night just so I could finish the rest of it in one sitting. There was a sensitive topic that was tackled during the story, which was hard to read about as a mother. However, Ms. Senate handled it gracefully and made it more comfortable for the reader to handle. (Seeing that she's a mother too, I couldn't even imagine her doing it any other way.) The dialogue was natural and realistic throughout the story and each character was portrayed vividly, making them even more dynamic and interesting. The only criticism I have is that Ms. Senate's editors weren't careful before letting this go to print. I found some spelling and grammatical errors scattered throughout the story. (If she needs an extra set of eyes in the future, I'd be glad to help.) This did not detract from my enjoyment of a truly wonderful story that I hope everyone gets the chance to read.originally posted here: http://chicklitcentraltheblog.blogspo..."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "This is such a fun and charming book!

Fortunately, Holly learns to love cooking and is able to take over her grandmother's Italian cooking class.I don't read much modern chick lit, but I'm glad I gave this one a try.

I've pretty much hated every chick lit book I've ever read. So much of it is about women who care most about shopping, getting into the latest hot new club, their weight, their makeup, and snagging that enormous diamond ring and great big expensive wedding. These characters tend to be so shallow and the books tend to be so thinly written that I end up loathing them. One exception to this is The Devil Wears Prada, although I probably adored the wrong character - I think Miranda Priestly is a goddess and loved that the book was filled with the kind of couture that transcends fashion and becomes art. The Love Goddess' Cooking School by Melissa Senate just made this list.The best thing of all about this book is how simple it is - a good story, simply told. No unnecessary embellishments, no cliches, no stereotypes, just an honestly told story about being in your thirties - a time of life when for most people everything is up for grabs. Everyone in this book is at a crossroads in their lives with their old life down the toilet for whatever reason and the course of their new life still uncertain. It made me think of the time after my divorce when I had to try to sort out who I was going to be, how I was going to live. It was a hard time for me, for my son, and for my ex-husband. Although I never thought it would come to where it has today, it did work out for the best. The thread that runs throughout this book is all the ways that cooking and eating and sharing both things bind people together and how having a strong connection to the past, like the one Holly has with her grandmother, is so essential to grounding you in the present. The cooking in this book isn't highlighted in any special way, but rather is a constant in the book, as it should be in real life. It's full of as many burnt bechamel sauces as it is sublime risotto. It acknowledges that the fun is in the process, not necessarily in the product (although it never hurts when the product is great, too). There's an important message here about not being afraid to risk, not being afraid to fail that really resonates with me.The other thread is Holly's relationship with her recently deceased grandmother. They had a very special relationship and that touched my heart. It made think of my grandmothers, both gone now, and how much they each meant to me and how many things I learned from each of them even though they were very different from each other. They were both an enormous part of helping me become the person I am today and I miss them both almost every day.This is a warm and beautiful book with an honest simple story that is filled with the good smells of garlic and onion and olive oil filling the house with love and companionship. I adored this book."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1310192-susan", "userReview": "What a lovely novel! I treated myself to THE LOVE GODDESS' COOKING SCHOOL after a crazy deadline. Then my cat got sick, which didn't exactly alleviate the stress. So I was very grateful for Melissa Senate's new book, which (like those old Calgon commericals), took me away for awhile. It was a pleasure meeting Holly Maguire and learning about her relationship with her Italian grandmother Camilla. Holly just broke up with a man she thought she was in love with and flew to Maine to see Camilla before her grandma passed away. She inherits Camilla's Cucinotta on Blue Crab Island, although she barely knows how to cook. But she practices working on her grandma's handwritten recipes daily and keeps the business alive. She even gets enough confidence to run a cooking class, as Camilla had for many years. Her first group of students includes a 12-year-old dying for her divorced parents to get back together, a woman who's lost her only child, a thirty-something woman looking for love, and a divorced man who can't seem to please his daughter. Through their cooking classes--always adding a pinch of memory or something equally magical to the mixture--the students and Holly grow and find what their lives have been missing. This was a very sweet novel that I could recommend to all readers. Let THE LOVE GODDESS' COOKING SCHOOL take you away for awhile, as it did me.

Holly has been waiting years for her unlikely fortune: her true love will like sa cordula, an unappetizing old-world delicacy. But Holly can\u2019t make a decent marinara sauce, let alone sa cordula. Maybe that\u2019s why the man she hopes to marry breaks her heart. So when Holly inherits Camilla\u2019s Cucinotta, she\u2019s determined to forget about fortunes and love and become an Italian cooking teacher worthy of her grandmother\u2019s legacy. But Holly\u2019s four students are seeking much more than how to make Camilla\u2019s chicken alla Milanese. Simon, a single father, hopes to cook his way back into his daughter\u2019s heart. Juliet, Holly\u2019s childhood friend, hides a painful secret. Tamara, a serial dater, can\u2019t find the love she longs for. And twelve-year-old Mia thinks learning to cook will stop her dad, Liam, from marrying his phony lasagna-queen girlfriend. As the class gathers each week, adding Camilla\u2019s essential ingredients of wishes and memories in every pot and pan, unexpected friendships and romances are formed\u2013and tested. Especially when Holly falls hard for Liam . . . and learns a thing or two about finding her own recipe for happiness.People have been telling me for ages to read See Jane Date by Melissa Senate but I\u2019ve never gotten around to finding myself a copy. When I saw Melissa had a new book coming out called The Love Goddess\u2019 Cooking School, I loved the sound of it and when a preview finally came up on Amazon, I had a quick sneak peek and I thought the book sounded like my kind of thing so I bought myself a copy. As soon as it arrived, I quickly finished my previous book and got stuck into this one. It took me about a week to read, but not a moment of it was dull.The Love Goddess\u2019 Cooking School has a wonderful plot, and I was drawn into the book immediately as we find out that when Holly Maguire was told her fortune by her grandmother Camilla and all that she\u2019s told is that the great love of her life will like Sa Cordula, an Italian dish made of lamb intestines that nobody likes. It was a great way to start the novel and I was sad I couldn\u2019t dedicate more of my time to the book. We learn Camilla has recently died and left her business Camilla Cuchinotta\u2019s to Holly so Holly rapidly has to learn how to cook her grandmother\u2019s famous Italian dishes so she can teach Camilla\u2019s cooking class as well as sell her wares. I thought the cooking class plot was fantastic and I enjoyed getting to know Holly and her students, Tamara, Simon, Juliet and young Mia. Throw in Mia\u2019s dad Liam and we have a fantastic and well-rounded cast.I truly didn\u2019t know what to expect from the novel. Just because the Amazon preview I had was good didn\u2019t mean I would necessarily love the rest of the novel so I was pleased to find that I did enjoy immersing myself in the book. I thought Camilla\u2019s recipes were wonderful, and I liked the way Senate made them unique by making sure every time Holly or one of her students cooked, they added in a memory or a wish to help it along the way. During the novel we also have some diary entries by Camilla written way back when she first started her fortune telling and Camilla\u2019s Cucinotta and I found them incredibly interesting. In fact, I could have read an entire book dedicated to Camilla\u2019s diary during the 60\u2032s at Blue Crab Cove. I must also mention where the book is set, in Blue Crab Cove in Maine. It\u2019s fictional, but it sounds like a wonderful place to live.I was thrilled that I took the chance on the book. I loved it so much that I\u2019ve ordered myself another Melissa Senate book and should I love that, too, I\u2019ll definitely be getting Melissa\u2019s other books. The setting was perfect, the plot was everything I expected and more and I absolutely loved each and every one of the characters and was rooting for them to get their happy endings. I would hugely recommend the book to all Chick Lit fans. It\u2019s a very sweet read, and one I am so so glad I took a chance on. It\u2019s lovely when you buy a book and it ends up being a fantastic read."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2262926-maria", "userReview": "I must confess I have a thing for books that are somehow related to Italy. And when it's through food? Even better! Oh, the wonders of testing a recipe you have read about. Reading a Melissa Senate book is like sitting down for a long conversation with a best friend. We talk about everything and nothing. There are ups and downs, smiles and tears, laughs and silences that long ago stopped being awkward.Some might call it a light reading, an easy escape, but I believe The Love Goddess' Cooking School is whatever you need it to be (and whatever you are ready for). It can be just another chick lit (even though I quite dislike that expression), or a revelation...You find yourself rooting for these characters for, at some point in your life, you have been in their shoes, you have been one or all of them at the same time. We all have doubted ourselves and others, we all have had to let go of something we once thought to be the only thing we truly had, we all have had to get up after running into a brick wall that we were so enchanted by that we didn't recognize it for what it was... Life plays its tricks on us and we all have different ways of dealing with said tricks. I usually find that writing them down or reading them/seeing them portrayed by a character makes it easier to acknowledge them for what they truly are, something you can overcome.

Quero aproveitar, antes de mais, para felicitar a editora pelo seu trabalho - esta edi\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 muito bonita e o cuidado com a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o, not\u00e1vel. Esta obra, que foi apelidada de romance m\u00e1gico do ano, eleva assim as expectativas do p\u00fablico de uma maneira exponencial. As cr\u00edticas da imprensa s\u00e3o igualmente lisonjeadoras e assim, \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel resistir \u00e0 leitura do livro, nem que esta seja apenas para poder comprovar se as cr\u00edticas est\u00e3o ou n\u00e3o correctas. Eu n\u00e3o fui excep\u00e7\u00e3o e n\u00e3o resisti a ler este livro. Camilla Constantina, cozinheira ex\u00edmia e conhecida na sua ilha de resid\u00eancia pelos seus dotes culin\u00e1rios e tamb\u00e9m pelos supostos dotes de sapi\u00eancia \u00e9 dona de uma escola de cozinha italiana chamada \"Camilla's Cucinotta\". Quando esta morre, a escola \u00e9 deixada como heran\u00e7a \u00e0 sua neta, Holly Maguire. Holly h\u00e1 muitos anos que deixou de acreditar no poder da culin\u00e1ria. Desde que acidentalmente, fez uma sandu\u00edche para a sua av\u00f3 que continha veneno de rato, ganhou um medo irracional \u00e0s cozinhas e \u00e0 arte de cozinhar. Mas agora que \u00e9 dona da escola de culin\u00e1ria da av\u00f3, tem que dar o exemplo e tornar-se uma cozinheira, sen\u00e3o admir\u00e1vel, pelo menos mediana. Ainda que Holly ache que nunca conseguir\u00e1 chegar ao n\u00edvel da av\u00f3, deseja ser uma professora aceit\u00e1vel para os alunos que se inscreveram no seu curso e poder continuar a leccionar o curso de cozinha italiana que tanto sucesso tem tido ao longo dos anos, pelas m\u00e3os de Camilla. Holly, que anda triste com a sua pr\u00f3pria vida e desejando desesperadamente a felicidade e um amor verdadeiro, vai conjuntamente com os seus alunos aprender que a culin\u00e1ria e as receitas que a\u00ed s\u00e3o criadas na pequena cozinha da sua escola, podem mudar muita coisa que n\u00e3o apenas as habilidades culin\u00e1rias....E v\u00e3o aprender que a felicidade pode estar ao alcance de todos eles, basta que eles consigam agarr\u00e1-la e mant\u00ea-la. Para ter, basta querer.Este \u00e9 o t\u00edpico livro considerado literatura feminina. J\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 a primeira vez que a culin\u00e1ria \u00e9 usada como justifica\u00e7\u00e3o para escrever os mais variados tipos de obras. E este n\u00e3o \u00e9 o primeiro livro deste estilo que eu leio. De qualquer forma e sendo eu uma f\u00e3 entusiasta de comida italiana, vi desde in\u00edcio este livro com outros olhos. A escrita da autora \u00e9 muito envolvente e todo o enredo fluiu de uma forma muito natural. As personagens, apesar de pouco aprofundadas, foram bem constru\u00eddas e exploradas da melhor forma. O enredo, que todo ele gira \u00e0 volta de Holly e de culin\u00e1ria, tornou esta uma leitura muito prazenteira. Al\u00e9m da culin\u00e1ria, a vertente amorosa tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 presente. A rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre Holly e Liam foi constru\u00edda de uma maneira muito suave, mas muito bonita e rom\u00e2ntica: capaz de derreter qualquer cora\u00e7\u00e3o. Gostei imenso desta obra porque a autora conseguiu captar pequenos pormenores importantes referentes \u00e0s emo\u00e7\u00f5es e relacionamentos humanos e consegue com isto, aproximar-se muito do leitor. At\u00e9 fiquei com vontade de estar sempre a cozinhar. \u00c9 um livro com um enredo leve, rom\u00e2ntico mas acima de tudo inspirador."}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3423663-meg", "userReview": "A word of caution for those picking up Melissa Senate\u2019s new novel, The Love Goddess\u2019 Cooking School: don\u2019t read on an empty stomach. I\u2019ve issued this caution before, I know, but trust me this one time, friends. Since beginning this warm and engaging novel, I\u2019ve been dreaming of tiramisu, spaghetti with Bolognese sauce, lasagna and ricotta cheese. As someone who feels she must have been Italian in another life (pasta, I love pasta!), the odd stains scarring the pages of my copy may or may not be drool. The prose was just . . . scrumptious. And Senate describes Holly\u2019s creations so well, you\u2019ll want to throw this one down and make dinner every time you finish a chapter.What I love about this work, Senate\u2019s latest in a long line of great books, is her ability to create likable, friendly and interesting characters who captivate you right from the start. Like the men entranced by the exotic, lovely Camilla Constantina, an Italian immigrant who arrived in America with her young husband and was widowed in the U.S., I was immediately drawn into Holly\u2019s world and felt like I was reading the story of a dear friend. Have I read the running-away-to-find-yourself plots before? Yes, of course. But in Senate\u2019s hands, a familiar story takes on new nuances.Holly is a bumbling, uncomfortable woman when first we meet her \u2014 aching from loss and grief, both in the form of her relationship with John and her grandmother\u2019s unexpected passing; lost as to what to do with her life. Having spent most of her adult years following men from city to city, she has no career or aspirations. She has no calling. And Camilla, when she was living, could tell her little about her future . . . aside from the premonition about sa cordula. She needs guidance. And through her grandmother\u2019s magical recipes, she finds solace and direction.Liam\u2019s slow pursuit of Holly was magical, too, and felt honest. Though initially attracted to one another, Holly and Liam don\u2019t suddenly find themselves locked in a passionate embrace. There are so many factors to consider: rules to follow; guidelines that should be met. And it takes a whole lot of thinking and analyzing for them to move forward. Of course, when they do? Well. Love can\u2019t happen along someone else\u2019s guidelines . . . sometimes we make the rules up for ourselves.I\u2019ve read and loved many of Melissa Senate\u2019s novels, including The Solomon Sisters Wise Up, and this was a departure from her usual fare. Still about women, love and family, yes, but there were no sisters here to speak of \u2014 and sisters appear often in Senate\u2019s works! I\u2019m happy to report this is my favorite Senate read of all, and a book I\u2019ll still be thinking about in the months to come. Holly is an inspiration.Now, where\u2019s that tiramisu?"}, {"userName": "Amberalba Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20882739-amberalba-dawn", "userReview": "Bello, bello, bello. Non posso dire altro di questo libro. Mi ha veramente conquistata. Lo so che potrei essere condizionata dalla mia grande passione per la cucina, ma credetemi, poche volte ho trovato un libro cos\u00ec coinvolgente da fare una grandissima fatica a staccare gli occhi dalle pagine.Melissa Senate ha un grande dono, quello di saper raccontare in modo semplice sentimenti enormemente complessi. In pi\u00f9 lo fa con una saggezza che fa spiccare il libro e non puoi leggerlo pensando che sia solo una storia d'amore.E' vero, ce n'\u00e8 tanto di amore in questo romanzo, ma non \u00e8 una storia stucchevole inzuppata di felicit\u00e0. E' una storia come quelle che possono vivere tanti di noi tutti i giorni. L'amore non se ne sta da solo, avvolto nella sua bella velina rosa, ma si accompagna con tutti quei sentimenti complicati che spesso ci mettono in difficolt\u00e0 o ci fanno sentire al settimo cielo: tristezza, frustrazione, rimpianto, ma anche coraggio, speranza e felicit\u00e0.Nel libro non troverete una storia sola, ve ne sono tante. A cominciare da quella di Holly, ragazza che ormai \u00e8 giunta alla fatidica domanda \"Cosa- voglio- dalla- vita?\", ma non riesce a trovare la risposta perch\u00e9 si sente inadatta a tutto. Liam, che cerca un equilibrio tra il difficile compito di tirare su una figlia da solo e cercare di rifarsi una vita rimettendo insieme i pezzi dei loro cuori spezzati. Mia, ragazzina che sogna ed idealizza una mamma ormai lontana. Juliet, che deve cercare di andare avanti nonostante nuoti in un mare di ricordi causati dal dolore pi\u00f9 grande che mai si possa avere. Tamara e Simon, due persone molto sole che si interrogano sulla possibilit\u00e0 di trovare prima o poi qualcuno da amare. Tutti loro si incontreranno per caso, o per destino, in una cucina speciale, dove, proprio grazie alle speciali ricette di Camilla, impareranno una grande lezione di vita.Del resto mia nonna lo diceva sempre, che l'importante \u00e8 desiderare e ricordare... non che si avveri quello che vorresti, non che il ricordo faccia soffrire. Perch\u00e9 quando desideri qualcosa, chiedi. E quando chiedi, stai gi\u00e0 provando. E tutti quanti non possiamo far altro che provareLe ricette della cucina segreta dell'amore \u00e8 uno di quei libri da tenere con s\u00e9 e tirare fuori quando ci si vuole fare una coccola, un piccolo regalo per ricordarci che nella vita non bisogna tirarsi mai indietro. Se la si cerca, la felicit\u00e0 \u00e8 sempre possibile trovarla."}], "description": "From the bestselling author of See Jane Date and The Secret of Joy comes a charming, warm-hearted story about a woman\u2019s search for happiness after inheriting her grandmother\u2019s cooking school.When Holly Maguire inherits \u201cCamilla\u2019s Cucinotta,\u201d her late grandmother\u2019s home-based Italian cooking school in Blue Crab Island, Maine, twelve of the sixteen students for the upcoming fall class drop out.
