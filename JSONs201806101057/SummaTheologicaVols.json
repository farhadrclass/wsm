It is a monumental work, which in printed form extends over five volumes and three thousand densely printed pages. So it is not surprising that it took me this long to finish it. The fact is, though, that I probably would have never ventured into reading it cover to cover in the first place were it not for electronic publishing. The printed version costs $150, which is not actually much considering that most college textbooks these days can cost up to twice that much \u2013 if not more. The Kindle edition, on the other hand, costs 99 cents. Yes, it costs less than a dollar. However, it wasn\u2019t the price that made me buy it and read it, it was the convenience of electronic form, which made it incredibly portable and accessible. Over the years I would be reading Summa on my Kindle, iPhone, iPad, and in all sorts of common and unlikely places \u2013 my desk, my bed, while waiting for my haircut, while waiting for the plane to take off, on the elliptical machine in the gym, while listening to a boring lecture, and sometimes even while waiting for the light to turn green at the traffic stop. (I know, I know.)Summa is not an easy read by any stretch of imagination. It is a densely argued treatise on almost all topics of Christian theology. It is also written in terms of concepts and categories derived form Aristotelian and Medieval philosophy, which are largely unfamiliar to the modern readers. Reading it can oftentimes feel like going through a large advanced mathematics textbook, with all the proofs and carefully precise reasoning that this entails. I knew all of this fully well before taking this plunge, but it did not deter me. I can\u2019t say that I carefully thought out all the arguments that were laid out, and probably not much of it stuck with me in the end. However, at the end of it all I believe it was a more than worthwhile endeavor. First of all, it made me renew and deepen my appreciation for the Catholic Theology. It reminded me of the old saw that the Catholic Church is much bigger from within than form without. Catholic Theology is a vast repository of knowledge and insight that is well worth exploring throughout your whole lifetime. Furthermore, anyone who ever reads even a fraction of Summa could not in good faith ever resort to using the term \u201cmedieval\u201d in a derogatory and pejorative sense. The erudition, the intellectual firepower, and the appreciation of human knowledge in all of its forms and all of its extent is clearly at display in this monumental work. St. Thomas spent most of his professional life at the University of Paris, and the university system that we have to this day has been formed throughout the Catholic Europe around this time. This system fostered and sustained scholarship and research in all branches of human knowledge. All of us, whatever our field of expertise, owe a huge debt of gratitude to these efforts. Modern world without this strong foundation would never have gotten into the existence. At the heart of this system, and at the etymological root of the very term University, is the ideal of universality of all knowledge. This idea shines brightly in Summa. Unfortunately in recent times we have diverged from this ideal. Perhaps going back to Summa would be exactly the medicine for what ails the modern University. Finally, for me reading any type of good theological work is never just an intellectual exercise. It is, foremost in fact, a form of devotion. I\u2019ve read Summa oftentimes early in the morning at the start of a new day. I\u2019ve read it in conjunction with, or sometimes instead of, my scripture readings. Theology for me is the place where I can fully and completely love my God with all my heart, all my soul, and all my mind. I am grateful to St. Thomas for leaving us this great book that can help us in our Christian vocation. More than that could not be asked from anyone. St. Thomas Aquinas, pray for us."}, {"userName": "Conor", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1023840-conor", "userReview": "I started to read the Summa from the first question yesterday.

I am reading it for the second time now. Aquinas is incredibly important but ill-suited to our microwave and fast-food culture: he must be digested slowly, not scarfed down on one\u2019s tailgate in the stadium parking lot :-)Prospective readers should really have at least a minimal grasp of Aristotle. They should also possess the minimal intellectual virtue required to focus on something other than their own obsessions with pelvic issues, if they have them.

He proposes that a sex act is not immoral in itself, but that its permissibility depends on the \u201cright reason\u201d or appropriateness of the matter involved. Because the man is the agent in a sex act while the woman is \u201cby way of matter,\u201d the woman\u2019s status as property of a male and, by extension, the couple\u2019s suitability to raise the potential child according to perceived laws of nature determine whether a sex act is permissible or lustful and why. It\u2019s the creation and proper care of the potential child that are important to Aquinas rather than desire, affection, or egotism as in Plato\u2019s Symposium. I\u2019ll analyze Articles 1 and 2.\tArticle 1 assesses whether lust should be divided into subcategories. Aquinas asserts that it\u2019s the matter of sex acts that determines their permissibility rather than the fact of their occurrence. The act is permissible unless the matter (the woman\u2019s status and the man\u2019s relationship with her) satisfies one of two conditions. The first condition is if the act\u2019s intended not to result in the creation and proper care of a child because this contradicts a law of nature that sex must attempt procreation. If the act cannot cause insemination or if the parties don\u2019t constitute the married heterosexual couple nature requires it fulfills the first condition. The second condition is if the use of the woman in the sex act offends \u201cright reason\u201d by her belonging to another man (be it her husband [adultery], her father [seduction/rape], or God himself in the case of nuns [sacrilege] ) or if she\u2019s too closely related to the man (incest). It\u2019s the matter rather than the fact of the act that determine its permissibility, and it\u2019s right to subcategorize lust into species to reflect the kinds of infraction it may entail. \tAquinas\u2019 answer to Article 1 is problematic inasmuch as he equivocates the evaluative assertion that sex\u2019s value is limited to its procreative utility with an empirical law of nature that prohibits sex for any reason other than reproduction. It does not follow from any natural or empirical premise that because sex can result in reproduction, it must. As such, the first condition for the impermissibility of a sex act fails to provide the empirical justification Aquinas implies. What\u2019s appealing about his answer, however, is that it shows how our intuitions toward the permissibility of a specific act vary depending on context. In making the morality of sex acts contingent upon the social status of and relationship between the parties involved, Aquinas accounts for how we can have divergent judgements about identical acts. This is a more compelling argument than the citing of scripture alone since it attempts to explain our contextually dependent moral intuitions about sex.\tIn Article 2, Aquinas assesses whether \u201csimple fornication\u201d (sex between an unwed male and an unwed female) constitutes a mortal sin (one that directly harms a human life). He not only states that scriptural evidence makes \u201csimple fornication\u201d necessarily immoral, but also proposes a type of rule utilitarianism that deems \u201csimple fornication\u201d to be harmful to the potential child. As we saw above, Aquinas holds all non-procreative sex acts to violate a law of nature. This violation, in depriving the potential child of the requisite married heterosexual parents, directly harms a human life, and as such is necessarily a mortal sin. Importantly, even if there were a provision that the child would be properly cared for, if the parties share no tie of matrimony during the act, there is mortal sin because law is based on general trends. Since extra-matrimonial sex tends to overlook the potential child\u2019s need for wedded parents, it must, as a rule, be deemed a mortal sin.\tAquinas\u2019 answer to Article 2 is problematic both because, properly speaking, hypothetically harming a potential person can\u2019t constitute mortal sin and because he again equivocates an evaluative claim with an empirical assertion with regard to parenthood. He fails to acknowledge the fundamental difference between a person and a potential person in classifying \u201csimple fornication\u201d as necessarily mortally sinful. A mortal sin directly harms a human life, but it\u2019s a mistake to consider hypothetically harming a potential person as consequentially equivalent to mortal sin since no human life is necessarily harmed. At best, he could assert that \u201csimple fornication\u201d may constitute a mortal sin, provided a child is born. Moreover, there\u2019s the problem of his equivocating the evaluative claim that children ought to be raised by a married heterosexual couple with the empirical assertion that nature demands they be.\tThus, while Aquinas accounts for the contextual sensitivity of moral assertions, his arguments are weakened by his equivocation of evaluative with empirical assertions and potential persons with actual persons."}, {"userName": "Daniel Wright", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14201179-daniel-wright", "userReview": "204 days.

The Summa Theologiae is, without a doubt, one of the finest treatments of theology given to the church. One cannot simply do justice to such a work in an Goodreads review.However, I want to focus, in this review, on this edition of the Summa, published by the great folks at The Aquinas Institute. My short review is this: if you are going to get one copy of the Summa Theologiae, make it this one.In brief, here are a few reasons why I am convinced this is the best edition you can grab.1) You have both the Latin and the English text side-by-side for quick reference. This is a must especially for theological students and scholars.2) The construction is simply beautiful. The binding, the page type, the ink, the cover\u2014all of it. They have put together one of the most beautiful book sets I have come across in a world that loves to cut corners on books. Having sat with this for a few weeks now, I am convinced they could be charging double, but instead keep costs low for those looking for an affordable but handsome edition of the Summa. Also, the size of the books is quite large (think tall and wide), but that keeps them remaining quite slim.3) Thanks to the helpful construction of the book, you are able to read, at any page, with the book open flat. While this might seem silly to some, this in fact is crucial for the student who is wanting to reference while they read. For instance, yesterday I was reading Gilles Emery on Aquinas' Trinitarianism with Ia-27 open in front of me. The ease of reference was superb.The Aquinas Institute is currently working to publish all of Aquinas' works. You can learn more about them here: theaquinasinstitute.org After you purchase this edition of the Summa, I would also recommend that you get other works.

In order to understand the text well a solid background in Catholic history, theology, Greek Philosophy (Aristotle), as well as Scripture is necessary. Otherwise, the Summa is eminently readable for those who have an intellect to comprehend or appreciate. In terms of an introduction to the material, The Summa of the Summa by Peter Kreeft is helpful. The abridged version provides a picture that is beneficial for understanding the general composition of the entire body of work. Moreover, endless commentaries or journal entries have been written about the Summa. The Roman Catholic Church still considers Thomas Aquinas the official theologian of the Church. The Summa is worth studying (for Catholics especially) even when the reader has no intention of completing the volumes from start to finish.In sum, the Summa is divided into three general philosophical categories. The First part is concerned with Metaphysics, which is the more abstract subject matter, dense or difficult to read. The famous five proofs of God\u2019s existence are expounded in these sections. \u201cThe Nature of God\u201d section is terribly interesting and is still heavily debated amongst academics. The Second parts are concerned with the subjects of Cosmology, Epistemology or Anthropology. The Summa becomes more accessible, for the most part, in terms of lay readership at this point. The perennial philosophical issues regarding the freedom of the will and predestination, the nature of body and soul, or the existence of evil, all have been provided rigorist treatments here by Aquinas. Finally, the Third parts deal with the subjects of Ethics and Law. Even though many contemporary individuals rightly reject the \u201cMedieval\u201d or classical political world-view (in general) today, there is still a ton of relevant historical information and/or consistent reasoning about politics contained herein. The Summa laid an important cornerstone for the major political philosophies that underlie Western civilization. When reading the text, one can easily leave aside the respective aspects of barbarous Medievalism that for us demonstrate impalpable elements of political life. All the same, the Middle Ages were possessed of a particular kind of wisdom that is still highly relevant to certain types of political debate in the modern world, that is, when reconciled with contemporary \u201chistorical consciousness\u201d or scholarly methods. In the end, even denying that there is any relevance to the Catholic Church in the present\u2013age (which is hard to deny), or to the secular politics of the times (which is more debatable), the Summa still is without doubt one of the most important books of theology ever written, historically. In conclusion, the Summa was written in a scrupulously ordered fashion that makes reading the text quite easy when the basic structure is grasped. There is a learning curve, true, but understanding the text is rewarding nonetheless. For avid readers of Aquinas, the vision that comprehending the full sweep of the Summa or the theological world that Aquinas gives rise to is analogously akin to appreciating the beauty of a Gothic cathedral. Interestingly enough, the Summa was actually an introductory text for theologians in the Middle Ages. Aquinas here lays the groundwork for much of what would become contemporary catechesis in the present day Roman Catholic Church. In other words, Aquinas is the foundation for the method of teaching that educates upwards to a billion individuals the world over."}, {"userName": "Walter", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25109368-walter", "userReview": "Aside from the Bible itself, the Summa Theologica is perhaps the most informative source of information about the Christian faith than any source ever written. In it, St. Thomas Aquinas tackles pretty much every detail of the Christian faith, incorporating scripture, the writings of the Church Fathers and the writings of the ancient and medieval philosophers into the analysis. The work is divided into three books, the first of which deals with the nature of God, the second of which deals with the nature of man and the third deals with the union of God and man in the incarnation, the Church and the sacraments. Aquinas presents the arguments against each teaching, and then presents the teaching, defends it, and then addresses each of the arguments that he originally made against the doctrine. In this way, Aquinas supplies the Christian apologist enough ammunition to stave off any attack that is reasonably made against the faith. In my mind, if the Summa were more widely understood and studied then many if not most of the misunderstanding of the Christian faith would be eliminated.My advice to the aspiring Thomist is to approach the Summa as one would approach scripture. Don't try to read it all quickly. Tackle a question or an article each day and take your time in reading it. Reading the Summa too quickly would be like taking a ferry ride across the ocean, rather than deep diving in scuba gear to explore the riches of the depths. Understanding the Summa is a lifetime effort. The use of good commentaries is essential, and if you get into the Summa then you will want to familiarize yourself with the sources that Aquinas uses, such as Aristotle, Augustine, St. Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite and others. The technical philosophical language that St. Thomas uses would be explained in a good commentary, and it would not be a bad idea to identify a Thomist scholar who can help you with your questions.Overall, I am a huge fan of Aquinas and recommend him to anyone who is brave enough to delve into his works with a view to deepen your faith and your understanding of life itself."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12245422-tom", "userReview": "I've seen this work described as \"encyclopaedic,\" but I don't think that does it justice. While I don't remember it addressing how many angels can dance on the head of a pin (and I may very well have forgotten given that it's taken sixteen or so months of fairly consistent reading to get through), it covers just about any theological question you might think of and many, many more that would not have occurred to you from a 21st century vantage point.Admittedly, my interest in this work was primarily a result of its importance in the history of philosophy. It's one thing to be told that Aquinas sought to reconcile Aristotle with Christian theology and quite another to see how he does it. Going in, I thought I'd be most fascinated by the cosmological discussions in the First Part; it turned out that the ethical discussions of the Second Parts- especially as informed by Aristotle's model of human psychology- were most interesting. Aquinas did have to do some gymnastics to square the idea that goodness is a mean with some things that seem proscribed arbitrarily. But for the most part it became clear just how easy Aquinas made it for the Church to find purely secular justification for many beliefs with only a scriptural basis. There are also several discussions that put me in mind of George Carlin's routine on growing up Catholic where he talks about coming up with trick questions for the priest. For instance, did Adam and Eve actually excrete in the Garden of Eden? This is addressed in FP Q.97, A.3 Obj. 4. Or how about what happens if someone poisons the Eucharistic chalice after the wine has been consecrated? See TP Q.83, A.6 Obj. 3.A rating for this kind of work is somewhat pointless.
