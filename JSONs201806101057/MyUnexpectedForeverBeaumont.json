ENDING. EVER!!!!!  My Unexpected Forever\u00a0told a beautiful, emotional story about love and healing. It was never rushed and focused just as much on family bonding as it did on romance. It was both sexy and heartwarming. Seriously, there's just something about a bad boy rocker who is also a loving, caring dad that is absolutely heart melting!! I finished the book with happy tears in my eyes. Loved it!It is important to note though that this is the second book in the Beaumont series and despite it being about a different couple, I would not consider it a standalone. Book #1 in the series,\u00a0Forever My Girl, must be read first otherwise you will be missing a lot of context and character familiarity. The couple from the first book, Josie and Liam (and their son Noah), play a huge role in this book. Not to mention the fact that the heroine of this book, Katelyn and her twin girls Peyton and Elle are introduced early in Forever My Girl\u00a0 following the loss of her husband Mason, so that whole core group of characters play an essential role in this book. Basically, the series must be read in order to fully appreciate it.The story here follows Harrison, the drummer in Liam's band who since moving to Beaumont has found himself drawn to Katelyn. He's been a single dad ever since his three day old son he knew nothing about was dropped on his doorstep and since them he's devoted himself to be the best dad he could be for Quinn. He wasn't looking for anyone, but sometimes love is unexpected like that.But Katelyn is still mourning the sudden death of her beloved husband, Mason, who she had been with since she was 15. His loss left a giant hole in their lives and she's not yet ready to offer her heart to anyone else. Not to mention that with his tattoos and rock star life, Harrison is the polar opposite of Mason and just not her 'type'. But Harrison understood that and was willing to wait for her. He knew she needed time and didn't want to rush her in to anything despite desperately wanting more.But when the band goes on tour, their families all join in. Liam, Josie and Noah go, as well as Harrison and Quinn, and, as their new manager, Katelyn is also on board along with her two girls. Over the tour, bonds solidify and are built up and it becomes clear that the feelings between them aren't going away so... they decide to give their unexpected love a chance and maybe bring some healing to their two broken families.\n\n\"Imagining a life with her is as easy as breathing. I just have to find a way to make it happen without putting too much pressure on her.\"\n\nI absolutely love reading about heroes with kids. They just bring out this beautiful extra measure of protectiveness and caring that never fails to melt my heart. And Harrison was about as loving and caring and protective as you get. Seeing him with the kids just melted me over and over again.\n\nI supposed he's too big for me to carry, but in my eyes he's still my baby.\n\nAnd I have to say that I how flexible they all were. Their kids were the center of their worlds. In another book, I have no doubt that the idea of a rock tour with relationships and kids would be used as a major source of drama but these guys just took it all in stride. Separation was not an option and tour had to happen so they just all did it together. I totally loved their attitude. It gave the story such a wonderful family feeling.Now, given Katelyn's more hesitant, timid side, I wavered back and forth a little on how I felt about her. On one hand, I kind of wanted her to hurry it up and get with Harrison but on the other, I honestly loved how loyal she was to Mason. I knew he was gone but a part of me totally understood how she wasn't yet ready to let go.The story is told in alternating POV chapters between Harrison and Katelyn and for the most part takes place in present day but in many of the chapters were flashback scenes from both their lives. We saw Katelyn's memories of Mason and how dear he was to her and we saw how Harrison ended up with Quinn and how that changed his life.\n\n\"You can't replace Mason even if you tried, but you can find happiness and love if you allow yourself to.\"\nI wish I could offer her a place to sleep... on my chest. I could hold her in my arms. Rub her back until she falls asleep. I'd never let her go. I'd never let her nightmares haunt her. I can make things better for her.\n\nI actually really liked the slower pace of their relationship. It allowed them to genuinely bond first. Nothing was ever rushed and more than anything was how much I\u00a0loved how respectful Harrison was of Mason's memory and place in the family regardless of his physical presence. He respected Katelyn's love for him and never once tried to replace him. He just loved her enough to want a place in her life as well.That being said, Katelyn did have moments were she just plain, flat out messed up but she was scared and as frustrating as it was at times (especially the last time), I did understand it. She had loved Mason with all her heart, they'd been high school sweethearts and a cruel twist of fate had ripped him away from her and their family. Of course\u00a0she couldn't move on. And here she was fighting the feelings of falling in love with Harrison while still feeling loyalty to the man she had loved her whole life.\u00a0She had a lot of growing to do over the book and also had a lot of other areas too where she needed to learn to open her eyes a little.\n\n\"I don't think she like my tattoos\u2026\"\nQuinn rolls his eyes. He's far too smart for his age. \"I think your tattoos tell a story, maybe she should learn to read.\"\n\nHarrison and Quinn's realtionship was one of the highlights of the book for me. They had such a special, beautiful, tight bond. It was precious and heartwarming and was one of the most wonderful father/son relationships I've seen in a book.The romance was incredibly slow building but there was so much more to develop than just their relationship. There were three kids to think about and bond with and there was so much healing to go through and trust to build before the romance could be taken to the next level. I actually enjoyed the pacing. It was slow but steady and felt\u00a0right given their situation.The ending was absolutely\u00a0gorgeous!!!!! It was a 5++ star ending to me.\u00a0I read this book start to finish in one sitting ending at 5AM still glued to my kindle\u00a0with happy tears in my eyes and my heart filled to bursting. It was honestly one of the\u00a0sweetest endings I've ever read!!The story centers around strong themes of family, bonding, healing, friendship, and love. I truly love these characters and would highly recommend this series :)4.5 - 5 stars!!And one more Harrison casting pic for the road...**************************** For more of my reviews, book news and updates:\u2726 Main blog: Aestas Book Blog\u2726 Facebook Blog Page\u2726 Twitter"}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11284813-christy", "userReview": "4.5 Forever Stars!!!\u2028\nMy Unexpected Forever is the second book in the Beaumont series. If you haven\u2019t read book one, I would read it before starting this. This is not only Harrison and Katelyn\u2019s story, but Quinn, Elle and Peytons. It\u2019s a story about second chances, learning to love again, moving on, and family.Harrison James has always been a single dad. From the moment a one night stand dropped his infant son off at his door and never looked back. As the drummer in Liam\u2019s band, Harrison has always lived a life on the road, but thats never stopped him from being the best dad he can be his son Quinn. After Liam moves to Beaumont to be with Josie and his son Noah, Harrison decides to move there too. Then, the unexpected happens. Harrison never expected to fall in love. To start to feel things for a woman. Especially a single newly widowed mother of twin girls. But you can\u2019t help how you feel.\nKatelyn has had an extremely difficult year. After losing the love of her life, her high school sweetheart she had been with since 15, and the father of her twins, she has been struggling to get by. To get the twins adjusted to life without their father. Trying to work as the bands manager to support her family. Luckily, she has the support of her best friends, Liam and Josie. Then there is the unexpected. Harrison James. She never in a million years thought she would be attracted to someone like Harrison, but she is. He is so different from Mason, it just feels wrong. She is conflicted. How long is long enough to grieve the loss of your spouse? When is it okay to finally move on?\nKatelyn and Harrison do this dance for a good part of the book. They are in each others lives, they are \u2018friends\u2019, Harrison is there for Katelyn. Most importantly, he is there for her girls. For some reason, he can reach them better than she can. Her twins are still shook by the loss of their father, but Harrison makes everything a little easier. Katelyn is still afraid of the unexpected. She is hot/cold, yes/no, up/down for a good part of the book. Eventually, Harrison has to lay it out for her. He can\u2019t keep playing this game, she either wants him, or she doesn\u2019t. He needs to know where she stands. \nI shouldn\u2019t have to sell myself to you. You either like me or you don\u2019t. Thing is, you can\u2019t lie. I know you feel something, you just have to let yourself believe I\u2019m good enough to be a part of your life.\nEventually, Katelyn realizes Harrison is the man she wants. He will never replace her husband, Mason- he\u2019s not trying to, but he can be there for her and her girls, love them, and with his son Quinn, make a family. He was the unexpected, but isn\u2019t love always unexpected...\nLove doesn\u2019t know the way someone looks. Love knows the inside of who that person is.\n\nKatelyn and Harrison finally decide to give it a go. They keep it quiet at first. Of course everything can\u2019t go perfect... there is some drama. Mostly things with the band that come up. Katelyn has a bit of a freak out. She makes rash decisions before really thinking things through. She has trust issues. She kind of screws things up between them. Will she be able to get past those issues, move on and get to her Unexpected Forever with Harrison, or will it be too late? \n\n  I give him everything. My heart. My body. My soul. My life.Harrison James is just a dream. I mean, this man... tattooed rocker, loving father, sweet guy, sexy as hell, understanding, patient, kind, the list could go on and on! And those Christmas gifs he gave, wow. What a guy. It\u2019s safe to say I really loved Harrison, dare I say even more than Liam! And those kids! I just adored the kids in this story. We got a little bit of Noah, I loved Katelyn\u2019s girls, Elle and Peyton. I just adored their interactions with Harrison. Especially Peyton\u2019s once she started to come around. But I especially loved Harrison\u2019s son Quinn, I guess the apple doesn\u2019t fall too far from the tree because he was just as amazing as his dad, a little mini Harrison. The main reason this one isn\u2019t five stars for me is the heroine. Although I liked Katelyn and sympathized with her, I just hated how quickly she was to judge Harrison, and then to not trust him when he never gave her a reason at all to not trust. It was the exact opposite. He gave her every reason in the world to trust him. Not only are these books about love, they focus on family. These are not your typical rock star books, and maybe thats why I enjoy them so much. A fresh take on the genre. Overall, this was a very beautiful story. Broken hearts can heal, moving on is okay, and it\u2019s okay to give yourself a second chance to love again. I just want to throw in that I LOVE this books cover. It is gorgeous and it fits the story perfectly! This is a series I would definitely recommend. It gets 4.5 stars from me."}, {"userName": "Yvie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6488359-yvie", "userReview": "So what can I tell you about My Unexpected Forever? Firstly, I can tell you that it's the second book in The Beaumont Series and to be able to fully enjoy it, you should read Forever My Girl (Book 1) and My Everything (Book 1.5) first.What else can I tell you without giving away any spoilers? Hhmm, let's see...1. Liam Page has met his matchYep, I said it. Let me introduce you to Harrison James, drummer in Liam's band, 4225 West. Tall, green eyes, tattooed, rock star, dad; Harrison is everything you want in a book boyfriend and more. Whereas Liam had a history with the love of his life and his story was about winning her back, Harrison has a bigger fight on his hands to win the affection of the woman of his dreams and his story is about winning her over. And let me tell you, that boy goes ALL OUT to do that. Let's just say he pulls out some pretty neat tricks (I will never think of a fairground ride in the same way) and some pretty dirty tricks (cold shower anyone?) but its the way he acts towards the younger generation of the story that will make you open your heart to him and never let him go.2. There is one scene that will literally melt your e-readerI am not kidding you with this. When I read this particular scene in question, I had to step away from the screen for at least a good 15 minutes before going back to it. 'Hot' is an understatement. 'Steamy' doesn't do it justice and 'sexual tension' is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this scene. 3. Quinn will be the person you want to adoptOh my god. Quinn James is the most savvy kid I've ever come across in a story. Sweet, endearing, yet mature and matter of fact, Harrison should be proud of the son that he's raised. I want to babysit this kid. No, I want to be his mother. And I'm not the maternal type, believe me. The relationship between father and son will give you the warm and fuzzies, it's just so tender and heart warming.4. You will be overcome with emotionI won't lie to you, there is a fair amount of angst in this story. Both main characters come with their fair share of emotional baggage and Heidi handles this with sensitivity and feeling. I guarantee you will be bawling during at least two chapters in this story, if not more. Those who have read Forever My Girl will know the grief that Katelyn is going through and this is one of the main focuses in My Unexpected Forever. And I won't lie, Harrison has his own emotional baggage too, so what you're getting here, is how these two characters handle their pasts to be able to move on with their futures.5. There are some great one-liners that will stay with you for some time.One of my favourite things about Heidi's writing is the powerful way she can deliver lines and you get them in abundance in My Unexpected Forever. One of my favourites (and the response to it) is below:\n\"We can count our own steps\"\n\n\"I'd really like that, Katelyn\"\nNow, as is stands without reading the story, you probably think that's not so special. But trust me it is. It happens at such a pivotal moment in the story, that those two simple lines are almost a game changer. 8. You still get your fair share of Liam and JosieI know there are a LOT of Liam fans out there and I promise you, Liam, and Josie for that matter, continue to be a constant presence in this book. You won't feel their loss at all, despite the fact that this is not their story. In fact, I can tell you that after reading My Unexpected Forever, I fell in love with Liam even more than I did in Forever My Girl. And for those Team LiSie fans out there who still aren't convinced, then here's a little secret for you - there's a little something in My Unexpected Forever that's just for you...7. It will give you goosebumpsYou know that feeling you get when you're reading a book that you are absolutely engrossed in? The one that gives you goosebumps every time you think about it? The one that gives you butterflies and makes your heart jump when you think about what's going to happen next? The one that you think about constantly during your day when you're not reading it? My Unexpected Forever is one of those books. Ever since I've finished reading this story, I've been thinking about it 24/7. This is a story that you'll want to read and re-read over and over again.So, to sum up, if you like:A love storyAngst, tears and heartacheA hot rockerA hot rocker with tattoos;Men who are good with kids;Some steamy STEAMY sex scenes; andA story that will stay with you long after you've read the last page,Then you will LOVE this story, I promise you. If I could give it 10 stars I would. PS: A lot of you will know that I am a friend of the author's and I am also her beta. However, I've written this review as someone who loves reading books. Some of you may think the above is slightly on the biased side. If you do, please don't let that put you off reading this story. Give it a chance, I really don't think you'll regret it."}, {"userName": "Farah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10758976-farah", "userReview": "I'm waiting..."}, {"userName": "Catarina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11538033-catarina", "userReview": "4 Unexpected Stars!In this second installment we have Katelyn and Harrison. Harrison lives for his music and his son. He never expected to fall in love. And he especially never expected to fall in love with a woman raising her two twins alone and mourning the loss of her ex-husband. Katelyn can\u2019t deny her feelings for Harrison anymore. But she can\u2019t stop feeling like she\u2019s betraying her husband. Even knowing that he would want her to be happy and move on. But the most she tries to ignore her feelings and convince herself that he\u2019s just a playboy musician like so many others, the more she knows him, the more she realizes that is not true and her feelings grow even more. And so this story turned this book in a beautiful journey that teaches us how to mend broken hearts and how to move on after we lost everything. This was a very sweet (and real hot in some moments!) story. I loved Harrison, and I did like Katelyn although she pissed me off in some moments. I understood where she came from, but still, there\u2019s a limit for stubbornness. The kids in these books are awesome (as all the supportive characters!) but what I really liked the best was the moments where Liam and Josie would show up. They\u2019re still my favorites ones ;)Anyway, if you haven\u2019t started on this series\u2026 start!

For crying out loud Harrison is the drummer of a rock band, of course hes tatted up! I was so tempted throwing my tables across the room every-time this book repeated its self.

He is my new book boyfriend. He couldn\u2019t be more perfect! **swoon**. Honestly, if the rating was based solely on him, he\u2019d break the rating system :) Since the rating isn\u2019t that simple, let\u2019s talk about Katelyn. I was so frustrated by her. First of all, I get that her supposed bias is supposed to represent her fear of moving on but they made me really dislike her as a person. She had someone who was MORE than anything she could\u2019ve even dreamed of and she didn\u2019t appreciate or value him too many times to count. He deserved better. Her relationship with her daughters was something else, too. I felt that she could\u2019ve done more to bond with them, especially Peyton. She will never go down as favorite heroine for me but eventually she got her act together so I won\u2019t devalue the fact that there was some growth to her. The plot was very interesting to me. The pacing, imagery, and writing excellent. The ending was different and refreshing, which I appreciate a lot. I really did enjoy the story even as Katelyn was a source of frustration. Safety: No others for either aside from some flirting done while they are not together.

I loved every minute of Josie and Liam\u2019s story so when I heard there would be a sequel focusing on Josie\u2019s best friend Kaitlyn and Liam\u2019s best friend and band mate Harrison, I couldn\u2019t wait. And when I finally got the chance to read it, I was NOT disappointed. My Unexpected Forever completely out did my expectations and blew Forever My Girl out of the water.At the start of book #1 we learn that Kaitlyn\u2019s husband has died leaving her with twin girls Elle and Peyton. When Liam decides to move to Beaumont to be with his family, he is joined by Harrison and his son Quinn. Consumed by grief, Kaitlyn has no intentions of starting a relationship with anyone and especially not a tattooed drummer, who couldn\u2019t be more different from her husband. But love can be found in the most unexpected of people, and sometimes you just have to take a chance, to find your forever.This book was absolutely fantastic. I really didn\u2019t think that Heidi could top FMG but she really did! I felt the characters emotions as if they were my own and I suffered with them, cried with them, laughed with them, grieved with them and loved with them. It\u2019s safe to say I was a bit all over the place. I literally could not put this book down and even when I finished, I still struggled to let these go. And I don\u2019t just mean Kaitlyn and Harrison. The kids, Quinn, Elle, Peyton, and Noah (Liam and Josie\u2019s son) all stole a piece of my heart and I loved how they all came together as a family and helped each other when needed.My heart broke for Kaitlyn and the girls. Especially with Peyton because of her strong bond with her dad, and when Kaitlyn would have flash backs to moments when he was alive. I love that even though Mason wasn\u2019t physically in any of the books, he was there in their thoughts and memories and I really do love him as a character. And though I love Mason, I completely fell in love with Harrison. He\u2019s such an incredible guy. He\u2019s thoughtful, he\u2019s patient, he loves his son with every bit of his heart and he was a fantastic father. Even to the point of being there for the twins and helping them through the loss of their dad, and loving them like they are his own. You could tell how much Kaitlyn meant to him and it broke my heart that he constantly felt rejected by her.One thing I would have liked to know more about though was his tattoos. There\u2019s one part where Quinn says to his dad that his tattoos tell a story and Kaitlyn should learn to read them. And while he does explain the stories behind his ink to her, we as a reader don\u2019t get to find out what they mean and as a big lover of body art and the reasons behind it, I was a little disappointed. But that is literally the only thing I can say that I would have different because everything else was perfection.I feel like I\u2019m saying goodbye to friends now that I\u2019ve finished with the latest book in this series and that\u2019s stupid, right? I mean, it\u2019s a book with fictional characters but Heidi made me feel such a part of their world that I\u2019m sad to let them go. I wish that this series could just go on forever because I love it so much and I wait impatiently for whatever Heidi brings us next. My Unexpected Forever is without a doubt a book that I would recommend, and Harrison is officially my new book boyfriend!"}, {"userName": "Sarah Fitz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8489026-sarah-fitz", "userReview": "This will be the LONGEST 6 months!!

After my Reader\u2019s Block that made totally picky and unfocused on one book, My Unexpected Forever took me on heartwarming journey that made me swoon, laugh and enjoy myslef. Finally I could stick to one book and finish it. Thank you God for this book!My Unexpected Forever is lovely, touching story that made my heart swell with all this fluffy, fuzzy feelings. This is a second novel in Beaumont series, and this time Heidi McLaughlin tells Harrison and Katelyn\u2019s story. Story of moving on, getting another chance and creating loved family. Harrison is amazing man. He\u2019s incredibly sweet, caring and sexy single dad that I fell for instantly. They way he took care of his son was beautiful. Harrison is a drummer in 4245 West and as soon as he sees Katelyn, Josie\u2019s best friend, he falls. Deep, Instantly he knows he\u2019s found a woman that should be part of his family.But wowing Katelyn is hard task. Harrison knows he isn\u2019t the man she\u2019s looking for, his tattoos and rock star status aren\u2019t exactly working in his favor. His chances at making her his are pretty slim. Especially because Katelyn just lost her husband, man she loved very much and still hasn\u2019t moved on. Now Katelyn is alone with her daughters and dating isn\u2019t something she\u2019s ready for. Afraid of constant rejection Harrison burry his feelings with hope that one day, Katelyn will see the real him.This beautiful story is not a only great romance, but also novel about family. This book is about relationship between main characters as well as about their children. Quinn, Elle and Payton had really important part in My Unexpected Forever and made it more complex and heartwarming story. I\u2019m in love with Harrison, because of the fact how great he pulled a role of single parent loving his child. Something about rockstars that are sweet and caring make me hot and bothered. Man that is rough yet gentle for his children, caring and just so good is instant panty dropper for me. I couldn\u2019t believe that Katelyn was rejecting Harrison for so long, because I would be the first one to jump him and then force him to marry me. Oh and then pop few more babies for him. Overall, My Unexpected Forever is fantastic and unique rock star romance. Great, complex plot and phenomenal characters made reading Heidi McLaughlin\u2019s novel sweet experience. I am dying to get more of her flawless, easy style of writing as well as another mesmerazing plot. My romance addiction got a big, nice drag from this one book, this story is definitely something I would recommend.

You feel for her. You want to wrap her up in a blanket and watch movies with her and tell her it\u2019s going to be okay because you can\u2019t but just want to make her feel better. Oh and the twin girls! Oh they are capital A- adorable! I loved them. I love how they each had their own personalities too.HarrisonOh lord, how I love Harrison. You would think writing such a perfect Hero would be boring or blah, but no, it just made me want to jump through the pages and rip his clothes off! If you had to envision the type of man you would want to date, someone who is kind, patient, GREAT WITH KIDS, loves you for you, well that would be Harrison.\n\n\n\u201cI need her like I need to breathe\u201dYou either like me or you don\u2019t. Thing is, you can\u2019t lie, I know you feel something, you just have to let yourself believe I\u2019m good enough to be a part of your life.\n\nI said it in my previous review and I'll say it again, I am slapping myself in the face for picking up this series so late. Heidi is an exceptional writer, she can write flashbacks and make me (that\u2019s right! I admit it) LIKE FASHBACKS! What? Yes, it\u2019s true. A lot of things worked out for me in this read. I love single moms, I love the relationship Katelyn had with her past husband and of course I loved HARISSON who is my dream man.\n\n\nI want her around all the time. She excites me, makes me feel like I\u2019m about to skydive. I could live off the adrenaline I feel from her alone\n\nOh those flashbacks gutted me, I wept like a baby and I was just a ball of mess, but it was so good and I LOVED IT! YES, I LOVED crying because the writing is so good! You feel the emotions from page one to the finish. You root and cheer for them, you fall in love with the characters and side characters and it\u2019s a beautiful story.

From the moment they laid eyes on each other, we knew there was an immediate connection between them, and even under those tragic circumstances, we wanted to hope that there would be a chance for them somewhere in the future.\n\u201cI\u2019m a widow with two children and he can have his pick of any woman he wants, why would he want me and my baggage?\u201d\nFor almost a year, Harrison has admired from a distance the woman who stole his heart from the moment he met her, turning his affections into actions, offering her help whenever she or her daughters needed him, but never quite making his intentions known and giving her the time to mourn her husband. Katelyn did not fail to notice the sexy drummer in her life, everyone in her life encouraging her to move on with her life and give love another chance, but she does not feel ready to date again. She still perceives herself as married and as attracted as she may be to Harrison, she won\u2019t allow herself to admit it or embrace her budding feelings for a man who is not her Mason.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not my type and I love my husband, whether he\u2019s here to love me back or not.\u201d\nThrough frequent flashbacks into her past and the life she shared with Mason since she was fifteen, we watch her sorrow holding her back and keeping her heart in a past that she\u2019ll never have again. But the more time she spends with Harrison, the more her body starts betraying her and eventually she can no longer deny their physical attraction, regardless of the objections based on his rough stereotypical image of a rocker that her mind uses to fight her growing feeling for him. Every time they are around each other, her body fails her a little bit more each time, with a lingering look, a fleeting touch, a stolen kiss, and soon her heart is a battlefield of conflicting emotions.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the quintessential rocker and doesn\u2019t fit my life. I don\u2019t care that the way he looks at me makes me feel wanted. I don\u2019t care that the way he looks at me makes me feel desired. I don\u2019t care that the way he smells makes me want to crawl into his skin until I\u2019m enveloped in his scent. I don\u2019t care because he\u2019s not Mason.\u201d\nHarrison\u2019s willingness to wait for her to be ready for love again and to finally give him a chance to prove his feelings to her, as well as his eagerness to take care of her and her daughters, are heart-wrenching at times. Her hot and cold attitude towards him occasionally makes him doubt himself and his fear of rejection every so often discourage his efforts, but he never gives up. He is determined to show her what she is missing out on, but most importantly, how much he truly wants them to become a family.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me. I\u2019m nothing but a distraction. I\u2019m not the man she thinks she needs to help raise her kids. I don\u2019t fit the mold, the stereotype of the All-American husband.\u201d\nWhen Katelyn lets herself feel again at last, love finally heals the remaining shards of her broken heart and opens her life to a future she never even hoped to have again.Both prequels in this series, Forever My Girl and the novella My Everything, were beautifully executed stories in their own right, but this book sets a new standard in well-roundedness and flawless balance of elements, giving us a realistic and poignant account of a young widow\u2019s battle with herself and her reluctant second attempt at romance. We watch her inner struggle, we hear her fears, doubts, reasons for not giving in easily to her body\u2019s demands, and we cannot help but want her to be happy again. It is hard to blame her for not wanting to move on and put her past behind her when we are also shown the life and the dreams she once shared with her late husband, knowing she never expected to have to start all over again.\n\u201cWhat does he see when he looks at me? Does he see what I see? Does he see a single mom with two very young girls; a woman so broken and in pain because her husband was taken away from her far too early?\u201d\nWe are also given a hero who never yields, never lets her rejection discourage him from believing in them and in the growing bond being forged between them. There is also overwhelming emphasis put on the wellbeing of the children in the story, the attachments between adults and children being developed at their own pace and independently from the romantic storyline. This only adds to the overall completeness of the story, making the love connection between Katelyn and Harrison even more special and well-earned.\n\u201cI know she doesn\u2019t want me the way I want her, and I\u2019d rather be her friend than not have her in my life at all.\u201d\nI truly loved this book. I became invested in every single character because the perfect picture we could so easily envision for them was impossible to resist. This very emotional but much sexier instalment of the Beaumont series could theoretically be read as a stand alone novel, but knowing Liam and Josie\u2019s story as well is preferable.\n\n\u201cI could live a day without water if I was granted the permission to just stare at her.\u201d\n\nSee this review on my blog! | Follow me on Facebook! | Follow me on Twitter!"}, {"userName": "Kirsty", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10389044-kirsty", "userReview": "*5 big fat BEAUTIFUL stars.*I usually find it either so difficult to review a 5* book or the easiest thing in the world. I have a feeling this will be the latter. There was a million one things I love about it and I enjoyed every single word. I want to call it a 'feel good' book, and it is to some extent, I felt beyond happy whilst reading it, the majority of the time, but my poor heart also took a battering. I think Heidi McLaughlin is the only author I can recall that is able to have you fall in love with a character that we never met. Watching all of the characters - from Josie and Liam in Forever my Girl, to Katelyn now in My Unexpected Forever, mourn the loss of their old friend/husband, Mason, is so heart breaking. We know from reading Forever my Girl that Katelyn is trying to come to terms with the loss of her husband, Mason, the father to her twin girls Elle and Peyton. He tragically died in a car accident and I felt the pain of that death through every page of this book, as well as the first. In the first book, we briefly see a connection between Harrison and Katelyn and I was so excited when I knew this book was theirs. It can be a very fine line when writing a love story like this, with one mourning party, so I was nervous to see how Heidi would pull it off. How would Katelyn move on? Would Harrison push her, or let her come to terms with her feelings slowly? How would their children play in to this? I just couldn't see it happening without major heart break. \n\n\"You can't replace Mason even if you tried, but you can find happiness and love if you allow yourself to.\"\n\nI've seen a few quotes where people are complaining that Katelyn was annoying and had too much of a back and forth over her feelings. Yes, she was very wary about starting any type of new relationship. She fought her feelings for so long, trying to convince others (but mainly herself) that she didn't feel anything for Harrison, that there was no possible way she could be falling for another man whilst still mourning her husband. My heart broke for her over and over again when reading her POV chapters. \n\"I would never date a man who is covered in tattoos, wears a beanie and shorts all the time. He's the quintessential rocker and doesn't fit my life.\"\n I think had Heidi McLaughlin written the story in a way that Katelyn didn't fight her feelings and jumped straight in to a new relationship I wouldn't have enjoyed it half as much. It really wouldn't have felt real.Now, on to Harrison.. beautiful, beautiful Harrison \u2665. I'm beginning to think I have a brand new book boyfriend. A gorgeous, kind, warm-hearted, rocker book boyfriend. He was BEYOND perfect. There are so many sterotypes when it comes to rockers - the sex, the drugs, the alcohol, the ladies, the rock and roll lifestyle. Now, to some extent, that is life (minus the drugs) for Harrison, but only a small part of him. The other part, the huge part, the part I fell HARD for is daddy Harrison. Reading about this part of him.. the part where he is the most kind, caring and compassionate person to not only his own son, Quinn, but Katelyn's girls, Elle and Peyton. It was beautiful to watch. His POV were probably my favourites, albeit a little bit painful at times. He, like Katelyn, is trying to fight his feelings. He knows the sitution Katelyn is in and doesn't want to push her and he is forever hearing from her that he isn't her type and they can be nothing more than friends. Regardless of the deep connection that they both feel. My poor Harrison, my heart broke for him time and time again and I was just desperate for him (and Quinn) to get their HAE.\n\n\"Thing is, Katelyn, love doesn't know the way someone looks. Love knows the inside of who that person is.\"\n\nI LOVED THE KIDS. There is something so beautiful about having kids present in books, especially when the main characters are the father of said kids. It's rare and I love it. I really think the kids in this series need their own, or at least a book. I could read about them for days. I know they are not real (it was a shocking revelation, believe me) but they felt so real as did the situations and constant wise words coming from them. \n\n\"Quinn, you make being a dad the easiest thing I've ever done, but that's not it. I don't think she likes my tattoos and I'm very different from her husband.\"\"I think your tattoos tell a story, maybe she should learn to read.\"\n\nThe emotional impact of the story was something I thought I was prepared for.. not so much. I smiled, I laughed and I had tears on more than one occasion. It was so emotional. Heidi McLaughlin has written one of the most beautiful books. The ending was so beautifully perfect. It wasn't over the top, it wasn't unbelievable, it was the most realistic ending we could have hoped for, it fit the story of Katelyn and Harrison so well. I'm sad I've finished this book but I can't wait for more in the series. I love this crazy bunch.\n\n\"He's a part of your life and he's part of the girls' life. I'll never ask you not to talk about him when I'm around. I'll never ask you to stop loving him. If he was here, I'd hate him.\" I shake my head because that's not true. \"No, I probably wouldn't know you if he was here, and for that I'm both thankful and remoresful because his girls are the best, most beautiful girls that I've ever encountered and I want to do right by not only them, but him too.\""}, {"userName": "Jenn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3349239-jenn", "userReview": "4.5 LOVER of Harrison StarsWhat this book did to me:1.Sucked me in from page one.2.Made me feel like these characters were real people.3.Exposed me to a lot of different emotions.4.Made me fall in love with Harrison and his son Quinn.5.The author did a great job of making this story feel so real and alive that I forgot it was just a story and it didn't really happen.Harrison is my favorite man of this entire series so far. He is such a good guy, friend, and father. He feels an instant connection with Katelyn and wants to be there for her and her children while they grieve over the loss of a husband and father. He also wants to be there for them during the good times too. He wants to be a shoulder to lean on and to fill a father figure role in Katelyn's twin daughters lives. He doesn't want to take over the dad position but he wants to be there for them through thick and thin. Now if he can just get Katelyn to notice him and open up to let him in. Katelyn is having all of these mixed feelings. She judges Harrison unfairly as he is covered in tattoos, plays in a band and could be gone a lot traveling on tours. Should she trust him? What about all the groupies that hang around? Does he want her just for now or for the long haul? She's only been with one man, her dead husband Mason, since she was 15. They were practically joined at the hip. It's been 10 months since he died and she is feeling confused at the feelings she sometimes has for Harrison. So she tries to keep their friendship on a professional level as she manages the band and keep him at arm's length. Yet that's hard to do when she sees the connection her daughters seem to have towards him and all the nice things he does to help make her life a bit easier. This story takes you on a roller coaster of a ride where feelings and emotions are concerned. Harrison wants her but is trying to be patient and give her time yet at times feels jealousy if he sees another guy touch her. Katelyn isn't sure she could let another guy in and at times has jealousy issues too when another woman is around Harrison. Then there's the emotions you will feel when one of the children is missing their father or when Katelyn is feeling lost or overwhelmed. This story is told in Katelyn and Harrison's points of view and also from their memories in flashbacks. I really liked that we were able to get to know more of Mason during Katelyn's flashbacks. I liked that we get plenty of interaction with the cast from book 1: Josie, Liam, Noah, JD and Mr. Powell.We also get some drama in this book that wrecks havoc for more than just Katelyn and Harrison's relationship. This adds a little twist that intertwines Liam's past with Harrison's past and adds to the plot. Harrison did make me upset a couple of times but Katelyn's teeter-totter feelings drove me a bit nuts. I could sympathize a lot with WHY but after awhile it did get a bit old, unintentional or not. Also, Liam ticked me off with his temper a bit too and how it would cause Katelyn to react. What I LOVED about this book:1. Harrison2. The secondary cast3. Flashbacks4. The love Harrison had for Katelyn5. The little bit of humor I found in this book. 6. The connection and love Harrison had for Katelyn's daughters: Peyton and Elle. 7. The friendship between Quinn, Peyton and Elle. 8. DUAL POVs9. The ending10. Josie and Liam's wedding11.

But Harrison and Katelyn's story just melted my heart in such a different way.We experienced Katelyn's heartbreak in FMG, when the love of her life dies in a sudden accident, leaving her to raise her two twin girls without the man she loves by her side. But When Harrison comes to Beaumont during the holidays; she steals his heart in a moment. The only problem is, is that Katelyn isn't ready to let go of Mason and she doesn't know how to move on without letting go.Now please forgive me while I gush over Harrison for a moment. GAH!!! He is just freaking perfect.He has held his heart back to avoid confusing his son Quinn. His son became his world when that skank showed up and left him at his doorstep without a second glance. Can we get anymore perfect than Harrison ladies? I think not. He is completely understanding of the role that Mason must remain to play in not only Katelyn's heart, but in her daughters. He is a man, not looking to replace the man that was their world - but a man looking to find a place in their hearts. A place where he and Quinn can be part of a family. To give himself the love that he desires and to give his son the mother that he knows that he needs.But as we all know, the road to a happily ever after is not always easy. Harrison and Katelyn have their own obstacles to overcome. And at times Katelyn's denial of her feelings for Harrison were heartbreaking and frustrating. And we get all those feel good moments with Liam and Josie. This story just melts your heart. It was so much more than just a feel good romance. Heidi McLaughlin pulls out all the stops when it comes to the emotions. Watching the girls cope without their father and watching all the men step up to play their parts was so damn touching.

I knew this time to speed it up to 1.25 from the beginning so it helped. I absolutely love books with kids. Single dads, or men who take on another woman\u2019s kids like they are his own are my favorite male hero.Harrison (great name, it\u2019s my son\u2019s!) was both of these things! Single dad, willing to take on more kids like they were his, and he is also a sexy tattooed, motorcycle-driving rock star. Yum.One important note here. You MUST read Forever My Girl first. Though My Unexpected Forever focuses on a different couple, you were introduced to all of the major players in the first book, and their story really began there.Katelyn (please excuse me if I spell it wrong, I listened to it) lost her husband, the love of her life, and her twin girl\u2019s father 10 months before. She was with her husband Mason, devoted to him since she was 15. Harrison has been a single dad since Quinn was dropped off to him by his mom at 3 days old. When he moved to Beaumont to give his son a better life and live near his bandmate, Liam, he was immediately smitten with Katelyn.\n\u201cLife isn\u2019t supposed to be like this. I\u2019ve waited for the right one to come along, and when she finally does, she\u2019s so torn up after losing her husband that I don\u2019t stand a chance in hell.\u201d\nKatelyn pissed me off at times. At first, her biggest objection to Harrison was that he was a pierced, tattooed drummer. So not like her clean cut, boy next door, football playing late husband. She was so superficial at times! When she got into the real reason she couldn\u2019t get involved, which is her love for Mason, I warmed up to her more.\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve lost your husband. I know every day is a battle for you because you miss him. I\u2019m not trying to take his place with you or the twins. I just want to fit into your life.\u201d\nKatelyn really fought against falling for Harrison. There was a lot of angst in this book and a lot of back and forth on Katelyn\u2019s side. Harrison was such an amazing dad and an amazing guy, I felt awful for what she was doing to him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say. I shouldn\u2019t have to sell myself to you. You either like me or you don\u2019t . Thing is, you can\u2019t lie. I know you feel something, you just have to let yourself believe I\u2019m good enough to be a part of your life.\u201d\nHarrison was just a heart-meltingly good guy. I absolutely loved how he honored Mason and included his memory into their love.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a part of your life and he\u2019s part of the girls\u2019 life. I\u2019ll never ask you not to talk about him when I\u2019m not around. I\u2019ll never ask you to stop loving him. If he was here, I\u2019d hate him.\u201d I shake my head because that\u2019s not true. \u201cNo, I probably wouldn\u2019t know you if he was here, and for that I\u2019m both thankful and remorseful because his girls are the best, most beautiful girls that I\u2019ve ever encountered, and I want to do right by not only them, but him too.\u201d\nLikes:\n \u2022Harrison is the most amazing dad to Quinn. \n   \u2022Harrison and Peyton. \n   \u2022Very hot. \n   \u2022Harrison\u2019s little boy was amazing. \n   \u2022I loved the relationship between all 3 kids. \n   \u2022Dual POV. \n   \u2022How strongly the couple from the first book played into this one. \n   \u2022Love the flashbacks, but they were very hard to follow on audio, especially when the female narrator didn't pause at all before the flashbacks begin. \n   \u2022Amazing ending. \n  Dislikes:\n \u2022I can\u2019t stand the female narrator. She talks way too slow, and doesn\u2019t end her sentences and pause, she just continues. \n   \u2022Since you can\u2019t see italics when you listen, there was no way to know when a flashback is happening. \n   \u2022Katelyn's judgement based on looks alone. \n   \u2022Too much back and forth. Katelyn seemed much weaker in this installment than in the first book. \n  The Down & Dirty:\nI am so glad that I downloaded both Forever My Girl and My Unexpected Forever together. Had I not, I may not have listened to this one, as I really am not a fan of the female narrator. I love books with single dads, and I must say, Harrison's and Quinn's father-son relationship may be one of the favorites I have read. There is nothing I love more than when a man wins over the kids of his love, and seeing how all of the band families blended together was really special.Rating: 4.25 stars, 4.25 Heat, 3.5 Narration\nPurchase My Unexpected Forever by Heidi McLaughlin\nKindle\u00a0| Paperback\u00a0| Audible |\u00a0BN.com\u00a0| iBooks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnected standalones"}, {"userName": "Alaina Meserole", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50620706-alaina-meserole", "userReview": "My Unexpected Forever was pretty good for being the second installment in this series. However, it wasn't better than the first book in my opinion. Still enjoyable though!So in this book you meet Katelyn and Harrison. Harrison lives for music and his son. He never expected to fall in love with Katelyn so quickly .. nor did he expect her to have twins either. Their romance was cute and sweet. Mostly because their feelings were real and genuine. It was definitely an unexpected kind of love - which is probably why I enjoyed it so much.The kids in this book are probably what made me give this book a 4 star rating. They were so freaking awesome and adorable. Heck, if the book was just about them and from their point of views.. I probably would've given it 5 freaking stars. Overall, it was a cute, adorable, and enjoyable book. The characters were easily to fall in love with. I loved how they tried to ignore their feelings but in the end you knew that they would eventually end up together. Katelyn and Harrison were easy to ship and love."}, {"userName": "Aman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6039156-aman", "userReview": "Reviewed @ Enticed by BooksHoly Mother of Emotions!!! I don't know what I was expecting from this book, but it certainly wasn't THAT! I'm having a hard time expressing my feelings because they are all over the place. It's safe to say that My Unexpected Forever has blown my mind with all the feels it gave me. I couldn't be more happy with the way the author executed Harrison and Katelyn's story. Simply Brilliant! Books with kids do tend to make me very emotional especially when the kids are hurting, but when single parents are added to the story and make that two very awesome and completed devoted single parents who are also the potential love interest, then that turns into one amazing love story you don't want to miss. My Unexpected Forever deals with so many issues: losing a loved one, struggle with grieving, figuring out the right time to move on and getting over that guilty feeling. Katelyn had been living a great, happy life with her high school sweetheart and their twin daughter but that scenario took a 180 when Mason died tragically one night. Within a day, Katelyn was left broken and clueless as to how to handle her daughters and how to fill the role of both parents. I felt for her. Even if I don't know anything about being in her situation, her words were so powerful and heart-wrenching that it made you feel everything. Katelyn was hands down one of the strongest heroines I've come across in a long time, I loved that she wasn't perfect all the time, she did lose her mind and broke down at times, but that's what made the story even more realistic. I loved everything about this book. It was perfect! When I heard that Katelyn was going to be paired with Harrison, a drummer and single dad, I couldn't have imagined a more perfect partner for her. Harrison was everything that Katelyn needed, he was kind, patient, great with her girls, loved Katelyn with all his heart and more importantly, he understood the love she had for Mason and wasn't aiming to replace that. Seriously, who is that nice and understanding ? I need a Harrison in my life. Now getting back to the drummer part, YES he was very sexy, tattooed and pierced in the right places, big on flirting but only with Katelyn and definitely knew how to make her jealous. Oh, I loved their chemistry! It was playful, funny yet very sensual! One of my favorite part in this entire book was seeing the connection between Harrison and Katelyn's daughter's Elle and Peyton. Their moments really teared me up, especially the one on the end. My Unexpected Forever was a emotionally charged story about love, hope and new beginnings. At first I wasn't confident about the timing of the story, the dreaded \"Is it too soon?\" thought kept nagging me all the time, but once I opened the first chapter, I was so invested in the story that there as no place left for any doubt. I was hooked to Harrison and Katelyn's journey and didn't stop until it was over. And now I want more! I highly highly recommended every romance reader out there to give this book a try, but remember to read it in order because all the introductions happened in the previous book. Heidi McLaughlin has definitely made a fan out of me and I can't wait to see what she has in stores next!"}, {"userName": "M.R.

This book is one of my all-time- favorites. I can't say enough about it. It takes you on such an emotional roller coaster. I felt so much for Harrison and Kaitlyn reading it, and her kids, and Harrison's. Heidi McLaughlins writing is superb, and just gets better and better. This story will grab a hold of your heart, and not let it go. i read it on a plane ride to California, I'm a terrible flyer but this book eased my worries, and consumed my every thought. If you have read Forever my Girl by Heidi McLaughlin,, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read My Unexpected Forever. You will fall in love with the story, fall in love with the author, and want to or rather demand more from her!!!
