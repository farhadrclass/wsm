More a biography about a rock star with God tagged onto it. It is well-written and interesting but not from a Christian faith perspective.Stapp was the product of a broken home and was raised by his mother and step-father until his teens. It is clear that this step-father was physically and emotionally abusive and that unfortunately this abuse was carried out in the name of God as some form of legalistic attempt at purging sin. The devastating consequences of this were felt throughout Stapp's life.Stapp discovered rock and roll (he had always been taught that it was sinful) and formed a band \"Creed.\" The band became very successful selling millions of records which was at first Stapp's dream but resulted (as it usually does) in a chaotic mess of drink, drugs and sex. Stapp made various attempts at suicide after becoming addicted to prescription drugs and almost losing his mind. His turbulent thoughts during this period make for some difficult reading. He kept trying to straighten things out but was unable to do so. Stapp later married again and had children (he already had one child from a failed marriage.) I read in another source that his second wife has now filed for divorce and that Stapp has been in and out of rehab and continues to struggle with his various sinful vices. From a Christian perspective; Stapp repeatedly refers to himself as a Christian with a strong faith and belief in God. He sites this throughout his book and talks extensively about it. Despite this he repeatedly falls into all manner of sin and at times seems to justify this on the basis that God is a God of love and forgiveness. His latest band is described as a \"heavy metal\" band and it seems that Creek also had these leanings...Stapp was often asked about his Christian faith and described it as \"personal\" stating that his band was not Christian in lyric or purpose. Whatever ones views on Christian music I find it hard to understand why a genuine Christian would place himself in a culture that embraces and promotes the kind of vices that he knows he is susceptible to. It seems that Stapp became a \"Christian\" and then carried on living his old life, yes he made a few adjustments but there was no radical transformation or change in his basic direction. His life was still about him and his music career and making millions.....he even sued a former manager for negligent handling of his royalties. Should Christians be involving themselves in this type of legal action ....? Overall a confused picture of a man battling personal demons created through a sinful (and wasted) life fueled by fame, power and money. I wouldn't recommend this book to Christians; although Stapp doesn't glorify sin and admits his obvious flaws, the mixture of Christian values with secular will definitely confuse less mature Christians and may make them think that Jesus/God can just be added as a label to save them from an eternity in hell. But Jesus said \"If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.\" (Matthew 16 vs 24.)The book is free of bad language, there is some minimal violence and sexual content but it is not graphic."}, {"userName": "Debby", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2856670-debby", "userReview": "I have to begin this review with a disclaimer. I absolutely adore Creed. They have been my favorite band since the release of their first album. I felt heartsick when the band broke up and when the rumor mill blamed Scott for the band's demise. I was and still am a fan in large part due to the message of struggle and hope portrayed in their music. That being said, I was both excited and hesitant to read Scott's book. I didn't want my view of Scott or the other band members to be radically changed because of what might be revealed. The book arrived via UPS this morning and as soon as I got home from work I got busy reading and just finished it.I was not disappointed. Scott tells the story of his life from early childhood where he was raised in an abusive home to his reemergence as a confident child of God, a devoted husband, a loving father and a level headed rocker. I realize this story is told solely from his perspective, but I was touched by his seeming insight about his relationship with family, with God, with the music industry and his own failings. I think what touched me the most about Scott's story is the fact that he acknowledges that God was always there even during his rebellion from God's unconditional love. God was able to use Scott's darkest days and turn them into Scott's greatest successes. Furthermore, he points out that living a life in Christ does not come without struggle. It is a journey of ups and downs. I wish nothing but the best for Scott and his family. I feel blessed by his music and the message in this book."}, {"userName": "Jeanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5130755-jeanie", "userReview": "A honest look at lead singer of rock n roll band Creed. He is very much like the old testament King David who was called a man after God own heart but only Scott\u00b7s heart has been taken captive. It shares his struggles and his battle with depression. I am always wary of reading testimonies of this type because when you read something like this, you think I have cried out to God and I don't get the same results. The thing to remember is we come to God through Jesus Christ and what he has done on the cross, but the Lord uses different circumstances with each of us and the focus should always be on who God is and not the circumstances. I think this was the focus of Scott's life. He was not blaming his step father, however, he was struggling. Life is a tapestery and because of his past, he became a the singer he is today. Another question that came up while reading this that I never thought of before is does Rock N Roll and Christianity go together?! In Scott's case and many others that have searched their own hearts Yes. The group Kansas with the song \"The Portrait\" is a great example, but some Rock n Roll is a story and Jesus was a great story teller with his parables. It was told not to convert but show our struggles that so many can relate to. I loved how this book ended with the sinners creed which he lays all the struggles on himself and because of that he was able to go the Lord with arms wide open.I confess that I'm a sinner. Just like my old man. In word and in deed I enjoy my sin. In word and in deed my sin enjoys me. There is no one to blame. No one but me. Sin is my nature. I sin instinctually. Sin mimics the gates of paradise. Sin beats me to the floor. Sin is the dark shadow that no one can ignore. Sin screams \"What's yours I want\". Sin screams. \"What's mine I'll keep.\" Sin is forever knocking, beating at the iron door. Don't even open it for an instant. Sin always wants more. Sin forever stole the key. But you're not locked out forever. In this sinner's Garden of Eden where sin pretends to be a treasure. Sin wants to make you bleed. Sin cuts down every giver. Sin cuts every hand. Sin wants total control. Sin wants to command. Sin just wants to kill you. And yes, for you the bell tolls. So death came before life entered. In death sin was conceived. Sin will linger forever Blameless, it's part of you and me. But there's a silver lining to sin's story. And the silver lining is this-When I was out chasing sin. The truth was out chasing me and when it finally caught me. That truth set me free. Now I've shared it all. Perhaps I've shared too much. But in this you must believe. The only truth I have left is this, my Sinner's Creed."}, {"userName": "Harold Cameron", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7786049-harold-cameron", "userReview": "\u201cSinner\u2019s Creed is the uncensored memoir of Scott Stapp, Grammy Award\u2013winning leader of the multi-platinum rock band CREED. During CREED\u2019s decade of dominance and in the years following the band\u2019s breakup, Scott struggled with drugs and alcohol, which led not only to a divorce, but also to a much-publicized suicide attempt in 2006. Now clean, sober, and in the midst of a highly successful solo career, Scott has finally come full circle\u2014a turnaround he credits to his renewed faith in God.In Sinner's Creed, Scott shares his story for the first time\u2014from his fundamentalist upbringing, the rise and fall of CREED, and his ongoing battle with addiction, the rediscovery of his faith, and the launch of his solo career. The result is a gripping memoir that is proof positive that God is always present in our lives, despite the colossal mess we sometimes make of them.\u201d (From the Tyndale House Website).About the Authors: Scott Stapp is among the most successful artists of the modern rock era. As Creed's lead vocalist, he has sold over 35 million records, with 26 million sold in the United States alone. He has toured the world several times, selling out arenas and major stadiums. His song, \"With Arms Wide Open\" won a Grammy as Best Rock Song of 2000. One Rolling Stone writer has called Stapp \"one of the most influential and boldest rock writer/performers of the past 25 years whose fans must be counted in the legions.\" In 2000, Stapp founded the With Arms Wide Open Foundation, a charity organization dedicated to \"promoting healthy, loving relationships between children and their families.\" In early 2010, Stapp flew to Haiti to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. His first solo album, The Great Divide, has already been certified Double Platinum (2 million+ sales), and he is in the process of recording a second album, due out in 2012. Scott lives in Florida with his wife Jacyln (Miss New York USA of 2004 and Mrs. Florida America of 2008), and their three young children.David Ritz has written books with Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King, and many others. David is a born-again Christian, and his book on black Christianity, Messengers, was called \"inspirational and deeply moving\" by Time magazine. He has won a Grammy for liner notes and is the only four-time winner of the Gleason Music Book of the Year Award. Ritz lives in Los Angeles with Roberta, his wife of forty-two years.My Thoughts About the Book: From the moment I received this book and began reading it I found it nearly impossible to put down\u2026the memoir of Scott Stapp is so compelling and well written. Kudo\u2019s to Scott and David for producing such an amazingly candid, true-to-life, and no holds barred memoir of Scott and the band Creed.Scott Stapp is what I would refer to as a \u201cChristian\u2019s Christian.\u201d By the words of his testimony he proves himself to be as they say, \u201cthe real deal\u201d \u2013 an example to people out there in the world who are lost and trying to find their way to Christ without being victimized and traumatized by all of the hypocrisy, legalism, and deception that is so often seen in what is mistakenly referred to as \u201cChristianity.\u201d No, Scott bares his soul in his memoir and it is both touching and transformative in that his story and message gives hope to Christians who are living in the midst of this thing called life, dealing with the doubts, struggling with the sin and wondering at times whether we really are who we say and think we are\u2026born-again Christians living for Christ. Scott writes of himself, \u201cin the end I know that I\u2019m fatally flawed. In the end I\u2019m a slave to one master. The master is sin.\u201d After that you will read his \u201cSinner\u2019s Creed,\u201d But that is not the end of his story nor is it the picture of him that I want to leave with you. When you read the book you\u2019ll understand what I mean.Scott\u2019s story sounds altogether too familiar to me in so many ways \u2013 being abandoned by his father (as I was for a time in my early years of life); only to have a step-father enter his life to abuse him and his mother, his being a sadly misguided \u201cfundamentalist\u201d doing his evil deeds all in the name of the Lord I might add. His step-father claimed to have an understanding of God and his Word and a relationship with Christ, however, what he did to Scott and his mother is unconscionable and from a mortal perspective, unforgivable, but God can and does forgive all sin that is truly repented of and turned from. And what should have made Scott bitter at God and hate him in the end made him better and stronger as a person \u2013 more dependent on Christ and his power than ever and loving him as his Lord and Savior. Scott is no \u201csaint\u201d and the book portrays that very clearly but as a Christian who loved the Lord he struggled and still struggles with his sin and feels the pain of the wounds of his past but as he writes, \u201cWhen you serve a God of love, I believe forgiveness is possible. Not easy, but possible.\u201d And it is true, with man such things are impossible, but with God all things are possible.Scott\u2019s memoir\u2019s reveals the band Creed\u2019s humble beginnings as a rock band in Tallahassee Florida to their meteoric rise to fame and success worldwide. The book contains the good, the bad, and the ugly about Scott\u2019s life and his experiences as a rock and roll star. You\u2019ll have to read the book to learn the particulars but sufficient is it to note, Scott Sapp has literally been to hell and back and now today is on that straight and narrow path that Christ referred to that leads to eternal life. Oh I know there will be some who might scoff and piously postulate about how a Christian could do what Scott did living as he lived during the glory days of Creed\u2019s success, but who are you or who are we to judge? That was then \u2013 and yes, he has a past, but this is now, and Scott has both an awesome present living for our Lord as well as a glorious future looking for the celestial city those of us who are believers will one day inhabit. In Sinner\u2019s Creed you will find pictures of Scott, his family and the band. And at the end of the book you will find a section that contains the lyrics to his songs. And you\u2019ll want to read them as they are insightful and powerfully moving.I like what Scott writes at the end of the book, \u201cI\u2019ve come to see sin as separation from God. In that respect, I\u2019ve been a lifelong sinner, as evidenced by the countless times I\u2019ve separated myself from him. Those were acts of willfulness. I call this book, Sinner\u2019s Creed because I realize that my life as a Christian has always been-and always will be-challenged by these periods of separation. At the same time, sin is not the end of my story. I believe with all my heart that the living Christ, whom I love deeply, stays steady\u2026It feels good, after all these years, to say that I love Jesus and I love rock and roll. My passion for both is greater than ever before. I want to pursue my life as a Christian and grow my spirit, just as I want to grow my artistic expression. I thank God for all that is good and great in this world. I thank Him for allowing me to tell my story. The glory is His.\u201d And to that I say AMEN!If you are a fan of Scott Stapp and the band Creed you will want to purchase and read this book, and as I stated before, the lyrics to their music at the back of the book. Scott\u2019s memoir will leave you as it did me with much to think about and so much to be grateful for \u2013 that as sinners who throw ourselves every day on the forgiving mercy of Christ, that we do have a reason to hope and go on in this world. And as Scott wrote it best, \u201cThe glory IS all His.\u201dDisclosure of Material Connection: I received the book at no cost from the Tyndale House Publishing Company for review purposes.

Sorry Scott. I'm not a fan. And I despise U2's music and Bono's poor theology - so maybe you are in good company with your hero's. Not something to be proud of. (But you have a great voice. And i'm enjoying your solo albums.)Anyway,Thanks for sharing your life story with us Scott. Although it sure concerns me. I'm not convinced the bad parts are over - just different. Just when I really wanted to get into the heart of your future and Christian purpose...your book ended - kind of the way it began, from the outside looking in. You seem to muck about with religion but so what? How's that different from Mormons, Buddhists, J.W.'s, Charismatic Crazies or Catholic disciplinarians? You really didn't say much specific about your Jesus. Even the thief on the cross (beside Jesus) said more GREAT THEOLOGY in a few lines than you said in an entire book. Luke 23:39One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, \u201cAre you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!\u201d 40But the other rebuked him, saying, \u201cDo you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? 41And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.\u201d 42And he said, \u201cJesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\u201d 43And he said to him, \u201cTruly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.\u201dScott your story makes me think you might be stuck in Bono land: a generic liberal God follower who thinks Judaism, Islam, and Christianity all share the same God. Jesus is very different in those 3 accounts. And the Bible that you claimed to be an expert at (that was laughable, sorry buddy) says many very specific things about Jesus. Things your CREED songs don't even come close to capturing. Scott quote:\"My goal was never to make a clear statement about my religious beliefs through my music. It was enough to describe my struggle and hope that the message came through.\"What message is that Scott??? In this day and age we need as many clear statements as possible. It seems you have failed. Hopefully you aren't just addicted to fame and attention. But I understand if you are - WE all are in some ways.

Every day for 2 years I was forced to listen to his self-destructive lyrics and rebellious words as they played through the speakers of my co-workers computer. Every day I spoke to this co-worker about the redemptive grace of God and silently prayed that his computer would crash - except that that would put the two of us greatly behind in creating the forms needed by the various insurance people in the 2 buildings. So when I had the opportunity of reading this I was eager...then as I read it I found myself wondering when the true confession would come. Not only was I familiar with his prior music, I also was familiar with his Christian music. I am also intimately familiar with the demonic spirit of addiction and the devastation left in the wake of such spirits. Being the only one in my family not to dabble in drugs and alcohol it was a little hard to swallow this book. I felt that Scott Stapp did a lot blame shifting. I respect the fact that he has recovered from his addiction and that he is making an effort to leave this life behind him. However, I felt this book was almost a way to make him feel better about himself rather than giving glory to God or offering hope to those in the same circumstance. There comes a time in a sinner's life where we all must just suck it up and take responsibility for our own decisions. We must just look at our life and say - Yep - it sucked, I had a bad child hood, I had no dad, I had a terrible family, or I was abused, let down, beat up, forsaken....BUT I still had the choice. I did not feel that at any time Stapp took full responsibility for his own actions as being just that - \"HIS\" actions, \"HIS\" choices. He seemed to always point to other people or circumstances. I would also STRONGLY caution parents about this book as it is graphic in the sordid details of his life. There is little left to the imagination. I am sure that this is to appear to be transparent and to further point to the fact that he has come a long way from the muck and mire of addiction and demonic life styles that he was involved in.

And I've always been curious about Creed's insistence that they were not a Christian band when their lyrics were so obviously Christian. And even I--someone who doesn't pay attention to celeb gossip--had heard things about Scott Stapp that made me wonder what his personal faith was as well as that of the band as a whole.I took everything with a grain of salt, however, since this is only Stapp's side of the story and there is a lot of blame placed on the people in his life--people who likely have different stories to tell about those situations. Still, he does take responsibility for a lot, and I find it very brave of him to be willing to lay his life and faith out like this for the world to scrutinize.All in all, I found the book a very good read and I'm glad I bought it.

I was a fan of Creed after all, but hadn't heard anything of theirs for some time.Then recently, I saw Scott Stapp in the media basically having a mental breakdown in a video. He is convinced there is a conspiracy out to get him. That prompted me to start reading this book I had waiting, and maybe see what his meltdown was all about.This guy has had some really serious issues his whole life. A psychotic break was imminent. He is a diagnosed depressed person, and is suicidal at times. Then you throw in the religion, and you find him off-putting an extreme.I also feel very sorry for the man, as a human. This video may have been a public eye-opener, but the book shows how everyone's eyes could have been just blind for a long time. All the signs have been there all along.So all I learned about this rockstar I loved to hear belt out songs was that he is a lost and troubled soul with an extreme devotion of God and his love. I am highly empathetic to his tragic life as it is now."}, {"userName": "Josh Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3152075-josh-morgan", "userReview": "This review first appeared on my blog, Jacob's Caf\u00e9 (jacobscafe.blogspot.com).Somehow I made it through high school and college without knowing the band, Creed. I discovered them after finding lead singer, Scott Stapp's solo album during grad school. The music and lyrics were very meaningful to me and helped validate the pain and struggles I felt as my aunt died of cancer. Creed's music was also powerful. I've looked a few times to see if he was releasing another album, to my disappointment.But then last month, he releases his memoir, Sinner's Creed, and the lack of releases make sense. This incredibly courageous reflection on his life, faith, success, and struggles was quite powerful. I found it particularly relevant and moving from both a psychological and spiritual formation perspective.I've written before about God image, the psychological concept describing how we view and experience God. Stapp's book is a wonderful example of how experiences in life and relationships with others impact our perspective of and relationship with God. If someone did not believe in the incarnational way God works and how we affect each other's relationships we God, I don't know how they could doubt it after this book.Stapp's preface is particularly powerful, explaining how obtaining God's love required certain behaviors and work. Things had to be black-and-white clear. So clear that questions were banned. He goes on to say, \"And yet the story of my life is profoundly unclear... What remains clear, though, is my passion for the God of love\" (p. x). His life and story clearly demonstrate this process.At the same time, the end of the book seemed a bit strange, going back to a sin-centered narrative rather than a love-centered narrative. While sin is clearly important in the Bible, do we see everything through the lens of sin or through the lens of love? It has some major implications. Stapp seems to move toward the love lens only to almost awkwardly end on the sin lens. I actually wonder if this is in part due to the influence of the 12 step approach in his life in the last few years. While not originally true, in many areas, the 12 steps have taken on a neo-Calvinistic sin-focused condescension. Perhaps this continues to be part of Stapp's journey.The book is well-written (and narrated, although it would have been wonderful to hear Stapp narrating his own story). It was interesting to me, as a fan, but I'm not sure it would be as attractive to non-Creed or Stapp fans. It's another story of a celebrity's crash and redemption. At the same time, I think in our societal Cult of the Celebrity, it is important to continue to hear these stories to remember that not all is wonderful with fame. In fact, it can destroy life and faith more than anything else. I actually summarized part of Stapp's story in a parent education group a few weeks back when so many parents were more concerned about their kids' grades than their mental health.One powerful message of this book that we all need to hear is remembering our priorities. This will make all the difference. Despite Stapp's weaknesses, I was quite impressed with how hard he tried to maintain his priorities and keep his son's needs first. In fact, all-in-all, I have so much more respect for Stapp after reading his memoir and am an even bigger fan. I listened to his solo album and the Creed records for at least a week. The meaningful music became all the most meaningful.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher. I was not required to write a positive review.

They are one of my all-time favorite groups. So I was so excited to see that Scott had written a memoir and even more excited that it was up for grabs as a review book! I think I may have actually screeched a little.This book certainly did not disappoint me! It starts out when he was very young and talks about his family - his step-father and the abuse he suffered under him. With Scott, you go through him leaving for college, his first job, his first band, their first album, drug addiction, heavy drinking, his failed first marriage, the birth of his son, and then finally finding the woman of his dreams and realizing he had a problem and needed to seek help.But... the one constant during all this turbulence was his faith in God! Through all the drugs and drinking and the fame, he never once gave up on God. It was truly his strong faith that saved him more than once. \"I had gone from the poverty of my youth to considerable wealth - and I was only thirty-three. How could things be any better?\" \"How could things be any worse? I'd been assailed by a battery of pernicious drugs - Prednisone for my ailing throat, OxyContin for the injuries sustained in a car accident - whose side effects fueled my undiagnosed chronic depression. I was a mess.\" Their first hit song was \"My Own Prison\". All through the book Scott talks about how he felt like he was living in his own prison and how this song was so fitting for his own life. \"These lyrics sprang from my unconscious. I didn't deliberate. I didn't sit down and try to figure anything out. The words just flowed. The prison I wrote about was my own making, not God's. And I was guilty as charged - but of what?\" \"I was struggling to say goodbye to all the negativity. \"I am entitled to overcome\" I wrote. My message was simple - no matter how many times you fall, you have to get back up again. You never run out of chances. That's what God's grace means to me. through Jesus Christ we're all entitled to overcome.\" For those of you who are not familiar with Creed's songs - they are a Rock group, but... if you listen close you will find amazing lyrics! In each song you will find a not so hidden message, about prayer, about God, and Grace, and faith. They are not just a rock band and Scott Stapp is not just a singer song writer. He is a man of God with a strong faith and a message to sing about!This is a bare all memoir that takes you into the life of a rock star into hell and back.Another thing I loved about this book was that it really read like a story. You feel like you step into Scott's world, get to know his family and band members, feel what it is like to be in his shoes.At the end of this book is a section with all the lyrics of his songs from every CD. Scott says that his lyrics are his life and that you can't really understand him without understanding the songs. \"I thank God for all that is good and great in this world. I thank Him for allowing me to tell my story. The glory is his.\""}, {"userName": "Kaylea", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/883357-kaylea", "userReview": "Scott Stapp impressed me.As I read through his memoir, Sinner's Creed, I was impressed with his openness as he discussed the roller coaster aspects of his life.Stapp's memoir chronicles his journey, beginning in childhood. With amazing candidness, he talks about the things that helped mold and shape his faith and world view - including a step-father who both introduced him to a faith in Jesus, but also abused him physically and mentally.Then, without going into graphic detail, Stapp lays out the things that impacted him - and expanded on how someone from a fundamentalist background could find himself pouring out his soul into rock lyrics.Stapp is also blunt as he describes the rise and downfall of Creed - and the good and bad aspects of his lifestyle - and how his choices (along with those of his bandmates) played a role in it.If there's one thing that truly impressed me, is how Stapp only went into graphic detail only when necessary for the storyline. He did not \"point fingers\" or write a \"slash and burn\" memoir like some have released in the last few years. Instead he wrote a true, honest account of his life.While the memoir is graphic, it is not gratuitous in nature. I think I could hand this book to anyone - high school through adult - who might be facing similar struggles.I'll be honest. I identified with Stapp in many ways. I also found myself walking down memory lane as he talked about the background of many of his lyrics. I even pulled up iTunes, so I could sample songs as I read.I remember several of the songs well - they were either introduced to me by high school students in one of my early youth ministries - or were staples in the newsroom (my guess - the latter). Reading the lyrics with \"20/20 hindsight\" (and the help with his account), I continue to be amazed at the way Stapp struggled with his faith through his words.Maybe it's because I'm a \"wordy\" person. Maybe it's because, again, I identify with a few of his experiences. All I know is I picked this memoir up simply because I love the genre - and was ready for a non-fiction read.What I found, is a book that challenged me, made me think and honestly, left me wondering how God was using Stapp's words to minister to me - a simple children's pastor/writer in Arkansas.On the scale of one to five, I give this book a solid three and half to four. I think if you like memoirs, or the music of Creed/Scott Stapp, you'll truly find this book to be interesting. I also think this book will speak to people struggling through their faith journey.In my case, it left me wanting to purchase some of his past works - and left me looking forward to following his music in the future.I'm grateful he wrote about his life - because it helped me re-examine my own life in an interesting way.Note: As a freelance journalist, I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher.

I still remember waiting on my dad in his car, when I heard \"My Own Prison\" on the radio for the first time, immediately I was wondering who this was on 99.5 Kiss that was singing about \"the cross\" and \"crying out to God\". Later I learned the name of the band was Creed.I did pity the band with people constantly asking them whether or not they were a \"Christian band\" and I remember how the cheesy Christian subculture got so bent out of shape b/c Stapp said god-damn in one of his songs. Some bands have members who are humanist, atheist, Buddhist or hedonist and they express their worldview in some of their lyrics, but they're not constantly pressed by the media and subgroups to label themselves as a humanist band or a Buddhist band. But yeah, considering Scott Stapp's religious references that run throughout Creeds songs, I was curious concerning his life story and now 17 years I got to hear it.Stapp wrote how his first dad abandoned him and later on, how his mom started dating another who appeared on the surface like he'd be the most loving, cool and wonderful dad in the universe, while Stapp shared this, the scene from Toy Story 3 came to my mind, when the toys were getting the tour of the utopian play area that was their new home. It all is so wonderful, until nightfall, when they learn it was a facade and it is actually run by a totalitarian tyrannical teddy bear. Yeah, as Stepp wrote about how incredible his new dad was, part of me had this fear that there was going to be a BIG \"but\", and boy, was there ever. Soon after his mom married, the mask came off and his dad was seen for what he was; pathological, demanding absolute perfection and beating him for every infraction and using threats of eternal torture in hell-fire. Stepp horrific experience could have found it's place in Dawkins \"The God Delusion\" in his section of religion being child abuse. Of course, Dawkins would have then continued in bemuse bafflement and disgust of how Stapp somehow maintained his hope in God despite living under the roof of a twisted and abusive indoctrination. There is a lot more to his story, how Creed got started, the stardom with all it's miseries, the betrayal of band-members, his wife leaving him and his becoming a single dad, his wanting to end it all, dealing with alcoholism, his incredible second wife coming along, etc... etc...I enjoyed the book."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10819180-cindy", "userReview": "Scott Stapp~ SINNER\u2019S CREED~ A MemoirA true life story of spirituality, recovery, and the crazy world of rock and roll, as told and lived by Scott Stapp, lead singer of the band Creed.

It seemed like all they had to do was make a video for a song and it would hit #1. In the midst of it were all the questions: \"Is this a Christian band or what?\" \"Why can't Scott Stapp stay off the news by avoiding drunken stupidity and explosions of egoism in public?\" Everybody liked them..until everybody hated them. Stapp is pretty transparent here, even revealing a before-unreported incident in which he nearly died in a drunken, paranoid fall from a hotel balcony, from which he was rescued by a rapper staying in the room below.While there are places where Stapp seems to be making himself look just a little better than he really was, his story is quite fascinating, particularly in regard to the religion that was abusively put on him as a child, versus the faith that he spent his whole life trying to figure out in the midst of alcoholism.

Like any number of celebrity books, this is a book by Stapp and about Stapp. He has obtained a measure of wisdom that comes with his experiences, and evidences a sincerity about where he's at in life. While he notes his band mates and management were blameworthy in certain ways, the bulk of his reflection on the failures of his past focuses on himself. He understands that his own failings and struggles created a scenario for Creed's creation, but also the band's breakup as well. Stapp's reflections about his childhood are painful, and it's amazing that he has retained his Christian faith after the trials that his stepfather put him through. Stapp's life illustrates the failures of fundamentalist, rule-based Christianity (both in the mis-perception of Jesus and of the ways that it churns out guilt-ridden, graceless people)."}, {"userName": "Morgan Parabola", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43593977-morgan-parabola", "userReview": "I discovered Creed as an angst-filled pre-teen, appreciating the music because it spoke the words I struggled so desperately to find. I respected the vocalist for the honesty in his lyrics and grew up a less self-destructive person as a result of Creed's music. I had the fortune of meeting Stapp twice, once at a Creed reunion show, and the second time at a book signing in Glendale, CA for this very book. What's written in the book comes off very honest, the same as his lyrics and his way in person.I'm not a Christian myself, I've always been non-religious, and I can't say the religious tones bothered me. I respect a person's right to believe whatever they want... that being said I do feel that he tries very hard to live up to a standard set by his father and abusive religious upbringing.

Over the past few years, I've watched people leave ugly comments for this guy on the internet and I always wondered why people either loved him or hated him.

I think that he attempts be an honest storyteller, but his enormous ego gets in the way at times, casting shadows of doubt. Also, I was turned off by the Christian overtones. He seems to be Christian when it suits him, for instance, when Christians are willing to publish a book for him that other Christians are willing to purchase.

At the heart of these issues is abuse by his step-father, who was a minister. Scott's step-father punished him, once a week, whether he deserved the punishment or not. One of his punishments consisted of writing his step-father's sermons for him. This comes through in a lot of song lyrics Scott wrote for the band, including the song \"My Own Prison.\" Because of the lyrics, Creed was labeled by many people as a Christian band. In the book, Scott discusses his anxiety with regard to being labeled as such. Scott worried that he could never live up to this label, as he didn't view himself as a perfect Christian, not understanding that Christians are not perfect.

While I have dipped my toe in the pools of other genres from time to time, thankfully rock has always been my favourite. I\u2019ve always loved rock music. I\u2019ve always loved Jesus. I\u2019d never imagined the two could merge until one day back in 1999 when my brother Christian brought home the CD Human Clay, by a band called Creed. He walked into my room, said \u201cListen to this\u201d, and played me the song Higher. The opening riff had my hooked already and by the time the drums kicked in I had a huge smile on my face. I was in love with the song before Scott Stapp even started singing. Then came the lyrics. I looked at my brother and said \u201cIt sounds like he\u2019s singing about Heaven\u201d. Chris replied \u201cHe is singing about Heaven\u201d, and a whole new world was opened to me. I had never heard music about God in the Rock genre before. (I\u2019m not saying it didn\u2019t exist, I had just personally never heard it before). At the age of 14, Creed introduced me to the new medium combining two great loves of my life, and changed the way I looked at music. For that I will always be thankful, and for this reason Creed will always hold a special place in my heart. To this day Higher is one of my all-time favourite songs. Never could I have imagined that behind the man responsible for some of my favourite song lyrics ever, was a world of hurt. In Sinner\u2019s Creed, Scott Stapp shares the story of his life. A story filled with rejection, depression, betrayal and addiction \u2013 but also a story about the grace of God, the gift of redemption and the joys of unconditional love.Sin is forever knocking, beating at the iron door. Don't even open for an instant, sin always wants more - Scott StappSinner\u2019s Creed is a memoir you truly have to read for yourself, so I won\u2019t say too much in the way of spoilers. Scott starts his tale as a young boy with an absentee father, soon introduced to the man who would become his stepfather. The injustices committed against Scott by a man who should have protected him and shaped him, caused me so much anger. It\u2019s unthinkable how one man\u2019s warped perception of God can damage others, especially children! Some of the things he said about God\u2026Scott had many bad experiences with so-called believers throughout his life. He was even unjustly punished for confessing a mistake he had made and for telling the truth. It\u2019s truly terrifying how Christians can be responsible for sending other Christians running from the church. Having finally found a church where I feel welcome and at home, I have come to realise anew how important fellowship with other believers truly are. It\u2019s a miracle that despite some of the things other believers have said and done, that Scott never gave up on loving God even though he ran away from the church. The loving God his grandfather told him about is the One he held onto and it saved his life \u2013 a great piece of advice for parents! The foundation you lay for your child CAN be strong enough to withstand the storms of life.Scott furthermore shares stories of how he got screwed over (to my mind, at least) by everyone from his family, friends, his band members, his managers\u2026 it was quite disheartening at times to realise how much he had to go through and how unappreciated all his efforts were. Yet Scott never points fingers at others; he simply tells his story and shares how all of that led to feelings of abandonment and betrayal, which led to even bigger problems. Furthermore, Scott doesn\u2019t pretend to be a blameless victim \u2013 he comes clean about his own mistakes and takes responsibility for his actions. The reader gets an inside look at the pressures of being the frontman of a successful rock band, and the pitfalls of fame and fortune.What saddened me most is that Creed was labelled uncool because of the Christian imagery in their music. To me, this was the very thing that made them cool! While Sinner\u2019s Creed is a dark read at times, as it always does the light overpowers the dark. Ultimately it portrays how turning to God can save your life, and your spirit."}], "description": "Sinner\u2019s Creed is the uncensored memoir of Scott Stapp, Grammy Award-winning leader of the multiplatinum rock band CREED. Raised by an abusive stepfather, Scott was always aware of God's presence in his life, but it wasn't until years later, amid a life punctuated by sex, drugs, and rock \u2019n roll that Scott began to feel a need for God in his life.During CREED\u2019s decade of dominance and in the years following the band's breakup, Scott struggled with drugs and alcohol, which led not only to a divorce, but also to a much-publicized suicide attempt in 2006. Now clean, sober, and in the midst of a highly successful solo career, Scott has finally come full circle-a turnaround he credits to his renewed relationship with Jesus Christ.In Sinner's Creed, Scott shares his story for the first time, from his fundamentalist upbringing, the rise and fall of CREED, and his ongoing battle with addiction, to his recommitment to Christ and the launch of his solo career. The result is a gripping memoir that is proof positive that God is always present in our lives, despite the colossal mess we sometimes make of them.", "title": "Sinner's Creed", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13595616-sinner-s-creed", "average": 3.93, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1345756109l/13595616.jpg", "reviews": 174, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5814541.Scott_Stapp", "name": "Scott Stapp"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/108476.David_Ritz", "name": "David Ritz"}], "type": ["Biography", "Nonfiction", "Music"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13595616-sinner-s-creed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14330834-sinner-s-creed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18952225-sinner-s-creed"]}
