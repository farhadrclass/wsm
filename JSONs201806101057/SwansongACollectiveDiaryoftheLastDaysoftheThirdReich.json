I think you get insight and honesty in a letter from the Front that you'll never get from a history book written decades later, no matter how much context and hindsight it offers. Reading about food shortages is very different than reading a diary entry filled with excitement over finding a bit of meat in the rubble that wasn't too rancid. And that's why I was super excited to hear that this book was being released in English.The subtitle is A Collective Diary of the Last Days of the Third Reich. It chooses four important days at the end of the war in Europe (Hitler's Birthday, the fall of Berlin, Hitler's suicide day, and V.E. Day) and explores them through firsthand accounts from everyone they could find - anonymous German schoolboys, Russian soldiers, American journalists, concentration camp victims, Norwegian photographers, intellectuals in exile, up to the big names like Churchill, Stalin, Truman, and even Hitler. This technique gives a fuller understanding of what the chaos of those final days was like. You don't just see the Allies' grim determination to win and Hitler's crazed, manic overconfidence, but the exhaustion of German citizens trying to pick the ideal moment to fly the white flag. You get the exultation of Russian and American soldiers finally meeting as they fight their way to Berlin. Perspectives range from fanatical fascists planning the perfect suicide to people so beaten down that they can't bring themselves to believe, or care, that it will ever end. You get chatty letters home, pictures of marriages starting to crash and burn, diaries written in deep depression, and weighty philosophical musings on how this all was allowed to happen. It's absolutely fascinating. And seeing the same event from the same place through different eyes was just amazing. Whether it's two accounts of the V.E. Day celebrations at Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, or three accounts (from Russian Zhukov, German Keitel, and a Russian reporter) of the signing of the unconditional surrender, you can learn so much from the tiny details that differ, or the bits that are selected for inclusion, or left out entirely.Highly recommended to anyone interested in World War II, especially the fall of the Reich."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4669251-amanda", "userReview": "The tenth volume in what is considered a modern German classic, Swansong 1945 is the only volume to be published in English.

With the vise closing from all fronts, Germany continued to fight to the bitter end. While the Western Allies were grinding through western German cities and towns, the Soviet Union was engaged in a particularly vicious battle for the capital. Rather than focusing on a single narrative, SWANSONG 1945 incorporates the voices of those who experienced those climactic weeks \u2026 the victors as well as the vanquished. SWANSONG 1945 is essentially a massive collection of diary entries. The book is divided into four chapters dedicated to specific dates that represent critical/symbolic moments in the last weeks of the Third Reich:-\tApril 20, 1945 \u2013 Hitler\u2019s 56th birthday and the day the Red Army started shelling Berlin preceding its assault on the city.-\tApril 25, 1945 \u2013 The day the US Army and the Red Army linked up on the Elbe River.-\tApril 30, 1945 \u2013 Hitler\u2019s suicide-\tMay 8/9, 1945 \u2013 Germany\u2019s surrender (surrender documents signed on May 8th, but recognized by the Soviet Union as May 9 based on Moscow\u2019s time zone).Each chapter is simply a series of diary entries presented in the same simple format: Name, date of birth/death (if known) and the diarists\u2019 location at the time. What readers get is a more intimate idea of how the war\u2019s end was experienced by those who lived through it \u2026 in their own words. The wide range of voices represented is quite impressive: German civilians, concentration camp survivors, POWs, Allied and Nazi leadership and soldiers representing all combatants. Other than separating each diary entry, there is no additional narrative provided \u2026 the cumulative effect of individual experiences provides both clarity and impact. While I found reading 400+ pages of random diary entries rather tedious, I appreciated how there seemed to be a voice representing almost every perspective of the war\u2019s end. From deep inside Hitler\u2019s bunker, we get several accounts of Hitler\u2019s final days, including Hitler\u2019s own political testaments and those who disposed of his corpse. Even Mussolini\u2019s final ramblings are presented days before he\u2019s executed. Then there are the entries of German women fearing (or experiencing) the wrath of vengeful of Red Army soldiers; countered by the innocent letters of Red Army soldiers writing to their families. The book illustrates the dichotomy of victor and vanquished \u2026 the euphoria felt by Allied soldiers versus the dread and uncertainty facing German soldiers and civilians. What adds to the book\u2019s value is the varied nature of each individual account \u2026 especially among those who spent the final weeks of the war in Berlin. This is one of the few books that cumulatively views the war\u2019s end from the eyes of all combatants. The American and Soviet perspectives were particularly interesting because they both fought to defeat Germany, but were motivated to do so under completely different circumstances. The voices of those liberated from concentration camps illustrate that being free and being fed didn\u2019t necessarily put an end the misery. And even though defeat was eminent, there were still Germans who still steadfastly believed Hitler would somehow prevail. In essence, the end of the war evoked a myriad of mixed emotions that were more complex than simply elation for the victors or grief for the defeated. While there are many from all sides who expressed joy at the war\u2019s cessation, there was a palpable sense of loss, confusion and uncertainty of the future. In other words: After six years of seemingly endless destruction and death; what do we do now? SWANSONG 1945 is not a gripping or an exciting read, but it offers considerable insight regarding the war\u2019s impact on almost every facet of life in Europe. The vast array of perspectives alone is what makes this book a worthy read."}, {"userName": "Jonathan S.

But this book, a translation of the last volume of a German compilation covering much of World War II, struck me as less engaging. Much of that is because the last days of the war are already pretty thoroughly covered and well-known from other sources; Kempowski doubles down on that familiarity by structuring this collection around four specific days (though some entries cheat, being from slightly off their ostensible dates), and choosing four days when relatively dramatic events occurred. Even aside from that issue, a lot of choices here struck me as ineffective. The collection mostly includes the thoughts of people who are either German or in Germany, but then every so often entries will be someone else entirely. That would make sense if the perspective cast another light on events, or if enough such entries appeared to form another thread of events to follow. Mostly their inclusion just seems totally arbitrary, however, like the editor just threw something in because he had it on hand. And some of the writers included are pretty useless; someone may want to know that Ernst J\u00fcnger (or Mussolini, for that matter) managed to ramble his way through pages of impenetrable faux-literary metaphors even as Germany was collapsing, but I am not that someone. While some of the items and recollections here do have an undeniable power, there's a lot of chaff to sift through to find them."}, {"userName": "Ty", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1054481-ty", "userReview": "Fascinating collection of first hand accounts of the fall of the Third Reich, starting about two weeks before the surrender. Most of the accounts are from everyday Germans, some from the Reich High Command. Also a lot of accounts from Russians soldiers. Some Americans and a handful of words from folks like Churchill.The common voice, however, is the meat of this collection. Though much of it is translated into English from another language, some of the accounts have great literary quality.I think the concept worked best when the accounts were shorter, say a page or less. A few times near the end of the volume, several account went on for four or five pages, and they were not as enjoyable to read from a human perspective. (Though quite valuable historically.)War hurts everyone, even the victors to an extent, and that is one of the themes running throughout this collection. Other themes are how much (or how little) the average German civilian suffered after the war, despite they also being victims of Hitler's regime, the madness and continued suffering of populations even after the war was over, the deep distrust of the Soviets, and a pervasive weariness with the whole thing, dampening for many the expected ecstasy of war's end. Those that one are just too relieved and too exhausted to celebrate it, much of the time.It's the history we don't often get in our classrooms, but the type that shapes the world during and after such events, as much as, if not moreso, than the actions of Presidents and dictators."}, {"userName": "Karen Cowgill", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24312057-karen-cowgill", "userReview": "Very good book!
