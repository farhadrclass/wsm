Mercedes was my very first favorite author, when I was about twelve. I must have read Castle of Deception forty times; I can still call to mind entire paragraphs from it. But I know I was an idiot at twelve, and I really don't want to learn that Mercedes was never all that good to begin with, but I just want to read something totally unlike all the pomo super-modern lit fic I'm always immersed in, and this certainly fits that bill. So we shall see...Also, Tor? WTF is up with this hideous cover???***Yeah, so there's not a whole lot to say. All my fears were justified. This book is clumsy and lazy and horribly overdramatic and full of fake buildup and incredibly transparent plotting and beleaguered descriptions &c. It's a book for twelve-year-olds, and I am, thankfully, no longer twelve. I will probably reread Castle of Deception at some point, and I will probably regret it just as much. This is probably a good argument for non-hoarder-ing; if this wasn't just sitting on my shelf peering at me, I'd never have picked it back up and never have known how corny it was.

I was pleasantly surprised that it was set in 1970s New York and it was a refreshing setting. I thought that Lackey descriptions were well done, providing a realistic fiction version of what I would imagine New York City would have been like. I thought the characters were flawed, but likable, especially the main protagonist, Diana Tregarde. I thought the idea of a psivamps a fascinating concept, heightened by Lackey's integration of ancient mythologies. In particular, I thought Andre Le Brel completely charming and a match for Di. While I wish there had been more scenes with the two of them, the balance between the characters worked well and provided a wonderful pacing. I did struggle with the internal voice structure that Lackey employs. The technique was jarring and I found it to stifle the pacing of the unfolding story, especially during dialogue exchanges between characters. I eventually got used to it, for the most part. I would read another Lackey book in the future and I probably will revisit this one again in the future."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca", "userReview": "I'd originally read this book back in my heavy-Lackey, middle/high school phase. Now having lived and worked in New York for a few years (and no longer being a hormone-drenched teenager), I found myself curious about how it would stand up.Lackey was doing urban fantasy before it really caught on--if her vampires are derivative of anyone's, they're Rice-esque. So you don't have to worry about errant sparkles, at least.There may be some lingering affection biasing me here, but I thought this held up surprisingly well. Oh, the prose is purple and the plot angst-drenched. But for a psychic investigator whose day job is writing bodice rippers, Diana is refreshingly practical and down-to-earth. The dialogue flows with warmth and humor, the tension ratchets up nicely, the bad guys are a mix of the inhumanly creepy, the all-too-humanly evil, and the banally selfish who made some bad choices. Is it brilliant? No, not particularly. But it's entertaining, and succeeds at its own goals well. The vampire love interest is attracted to the heroine because of her strength and intelligence, not because she smells like the best steak dinner ever. And if anyone tried to pick her up and carry her around for her own good against her will, Tregarde would kick their butt into next week."}, {"userName": "farmwifetwo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1911280-farmwifetwo", "userReview": "DNF at 50pgs.I'm simply not interested.

She finds herself caught up in a complex series of what at first appears to be coincidence, but with the help of her friends and a man she just met, she puts the pieces together to find that many of the strange things happening were really linked together.Diana experiences every possible emotion in this book and Lackey is there to show them to us in a detailed way that leaves the reader grinning at her jokes, wishing we could give her comfort as she cries, and wanting to hide in the corner with her fears.Overall, quite a good book. The story was engaging from the beginning and had enough twists and turns to keep you interested without confusing or muddling the chain of events. Personally, I would have liked to see the characters of Lenny and Keith, who in their own way played quite an important, if small role, expanded on a little more as they seemed a bit flat. At times the story began to turn towards a romance novel, but before it could get too far Lackey reigned it in and got back on track."}, {"userName": "Lisa (Harmonybites)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites", "userReview": "Before Buffy or Hamilton's Anita Blake or Harris' Sookie Stackhouse, Lackey was writing Urban Fantasy with a strong heroine, Diana Tregarde, starting with Burning Water and also including, besides this one, Jinx High. Diana is a practicing witch and a \"Guardian\" sworn to protect innocents who get caught up in the supernatural.Of the three novels, I think this is the strongest. I've read the Tregarde novels didn't sell well, and that's why Lackey hasn't written more with this character. I find that a shame--I like these books as much as any by Lackey and more than many an urban fantasy featuring vampires that are bestsellers. I like the vampire character, too, Andre Le Brel, and how well he partners with Diana. This story is actually a prequel to the first published book, Burning Water, so you could start here first."}, {"userName": "Tarma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3503467-tarma", "userReview": "I read this book first of the Diane Tregarde series.

If for no other reason, this book gets 5 stars.Note: It is through reading the books of Mercedes Lackey that I was introduced to the idea that many things which I had experienced in life and thought were just my imagination had been experienced by many other persons and were actually going on, real. This was a wonderfully liberating thing. Yes, I really AM hearing/feeling/being this way. Yes, there are psychic parasites (as well as other kinds of parasites).

Diana ran the gamut for me, she wasn't the strong woman I had the idea she'd be, although I wouldn't categorize her as weak exactly. Unfortunately, it seemed to me that she spent an awful amount of time on either feeling sorry for herself or weeping, sometimes both. Good lord woman! Get it together! I didn't mind it so much earlier on because I thought she would grow by the last page, but it stayed pretty even throughout.The book takes place in the seventies, around the Watergate scandal, so there are some major differences in speech and how people act. I get the feeling that even though it wasn't published until 1990, it might have been written in the seventies. Maybe it wasn't and I'm wrong, but the book sure gives off that feeling. Anyway, I liked some of the ideas, especially the gaki (although stop calling him the \"Oriental!\" Gah!!) and dealing with psi-vampires, but I thought they could have been explored in further detail. Instead the book features some odd and goofy exchanges between Diana and Andre, one of which deals with her anxiety attacks in a truly hurried and unrealistic way. I don't believe in the matter of a few hours they could just disappear like that, it just doesn't ring true. Almost half the book deals with another character's side of things, Dave, and while I could have used a trim on his view (he too had a lot of self-pity), surprisingly he turned out to have grown more by the end than Diana did. What really got my goat was the phrase \"Christ on a crutch\" and \"gods\" used to the nth degree. At a certain point if I heard one of those one more time, I swear I would have thrown the book across the room. Ugh!Overall, while it wasn't the best book I read, it kept me reading and I didn't hate it. While I felt the short story I read in Trio of Sorcery (Diana Tregarde, #0.5) was stronger, I'd still give the next book Burning Water a go (even though it was published first, chronologically, it takes place after Children of the Night)."}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2715018-max", "userReview": "This was a fun book. It definitely starts off much more quickly than the previous installment of the series, since it opens with Diana's perspective. I was still disoriented by the setting a bit, since it turns out that this is a prequel to Burning Water and Jinx High, something that isn't indicated anywhere. However, I had fun reading about one of Diana's earlier adventures, as it answered some of the questions I had after reading Burning Water. It was nice to see Andre, Diana's vampire boyfriend. He was a good character, and he provided a good contrast with the villains, a group of psychic vampires. Diana herself continued to be a great character, and I actually liked her a bit better here because the story gets inside her head a lot more. She's snarky but also caring, which is a combination I always enjoy. I also appreciated the inclusion of some gay characters, who were handled quite well. The plot is generally good. Reading about Diana minding a shop was fun, and I liked seeing her in the days before she was a popular enough author to support herself on writing alone. Once again, the reader knows what's going on before Diana does, but Lackey does a good job of maintaining suspense and making the story interesting. The rock band was pretty fun to read about, and the idea of a rise to fame that comes as a result of psychic powers was entertaining. I also liked learning about Guardian House, the apartment Diana lives in, even if it doesn't quite seem to match up with how it's portrayed in the Bedlam's Bard books. I appreciate that as with the previous book, a fair part of the plot was research to find out who was behind the evil activities. Once again Diana and her friends considered creatures and magic from a variety of cultures, which I really like. Over all, I continue to enjoy this series while also being sad that it's so short."}, {"userName": "Phoenixfalls", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3265230-phoenixfalls", "userReview": "This is the first novel I've read by Mercedes Lackey, and it took me quite some time to get into it.I was initially put off by the style -- very purple, adjectives attached to every noun (sometimes multiple adjectives), half of each page written as Diana's stream-of-consciousness thoughts, which were equally frenetic when she was standing alone in a shop as when she was having a panic attack. And while it isn't Lackey's fault (her magical butt-kicking heroine predates most others) the whole set-up seemed too familiar by far. It should indeed appeal to Buffy fans, but don't expect it to take the now-familiar subgenre anywhere new.Then I was put off by a number of items that cropped up that read like anachronisms, whether they are or not. For no reason I could discover, the novel is set in the early 70s, after the Watergate scandal broke but before Nixon resigned in '74. Yet there is a mention of Diana wanting a personal computer -- and I'm pretty sure personal computers weren't available until '75. There's a mention of feeling like being in a Stephen King novel -- but he didn't get published until '73, and I find it unlikely that his was a household name THAT immediately. I grant, the times are close enough that there may have been a week or two in '74 when a person might have thought all those things, but they just READ like anachronisms, whether they actually are or not.But around 2/3 of the way through, after Diana joined forces with Andre, the plot picked up enough pace that I sped through the rest. Andre was my favorite character, though he doesn't break the ethical vampire mold in any way either, and though I cringed at the way the romance was handled, it was at least blessedly short.So overall, I have to say I liked the book, but I am very borderline about whether or not to read another."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3648009-heather", "userReview": "I was pleased to see when I posted this book that there's a new edition out with a different cover.

Maybe you'll have more patience than I did."}, {"userName": "Narariel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19500232-narariel", "userReview": "The first Diana Tregarde mystery, this book is set back in the seventies, yet doesn't seem dated. I enjoy the majority of characters, including some of the ones that are just hinted at. The story has a good magic/psychic system in place, one that meshes reasonably well with the \"real world\" so it's not jarring one out of the tale. I like the heroine's weaknesses and her approach to them. The hero presents an interesting twist on the traditional \"romantic hero.As a side note, this is another of Ms. Lackey's stories that has gay characters. Not the main characters in this case, but they are definitely there. I didn't find the relationship bothersome, but it's possible some might not enjoy that aspect. Personally, I enjoy the story a great deal & will continue to re-read it on a semi-regular basis probably."}], "description": "Rock band Wanderlust is about to hit it big, guitarist Dave Kendall is sure of that. They're playing better venues, in front of bigger crowds-and the people showing up at the after parties are increasingly good-looking and cool. Some even radiate power, like \"Master\" Jeffries, the tall, saturnine man who seems to have some sort of weird control over Dave's fellow bandmates.But Dave's too tired to pay much attention to Jeffries. He's tired a lot, lately, and making music isn't as much fun as it used to be. Probably he's just working-and partying-too hard.Luckily, Dave has a friend who takes what's happening to him very seriously. Diana Tregarde is a practicing witch and a Guardian of the Earth. It's her job to keep an eye on innocents like Dave and make sure they stay out of trouble and don't become someone's lunch.Jeffries has been on Diana's hit list since she first spotted him pursuing a young Romany. Di wasn't fast enough to stop him, but the Rom have their own protector-a dashing, charming, very attractive vampire named Andre Le Brel. Together, the witch and the vampire face Jeffries and his evil minions in a battle for the soul of rock 'n' roll.", "title": "Children of the Night\n      \n          (Diana Tregarde #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14012.Children_of_the_Night", "average": 3.93, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385445746l/14012.jpg", "reviews": 124, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8685.Mercedes_Lackey", "name": "Mercedes Lackey"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Paranormal", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14012.Children_of_the_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/847766.Children_of_the_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/847750.Children_of_the_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21953351-children-of-the-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17342329-children-of-the-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13986.Arrows_of_the_Queen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28759.Magic_s_Pawn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28734.Magic_s_Price", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14014.Arrow_s_Fall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28735.By_the_Sword", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
