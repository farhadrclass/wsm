It's best to read the books in order, but the mystery can be read as a standalone.*****Hollywood actress and private detective Sarah Booth Delaney hurries back to her home town of Zinnia, Mississippi when a mysterious disease breaks out there. Several people, including Oscar - the husband of Sarah Booth's best friend and detective partner Tinkie Richmond - are in the hospital, seriously ill. All the patients got sick after visiting Zinnia's run-down Carlisle Plantation. Each human victim experienced a burning fever and delirium before falling into a deathlike coma. The cause of the sickness is unknown, though it seems to be connected to the plantation's bioengineered cultivar. The Carlisle Plantation, which is no longer a profitable working concern, is being used to grow an experimental cotton crop that - in addition to being plagued by boll weevils - may harbor some unidentified infectious agent. The Carlisle estate is a source of contention between its two co-owners, brother and sister Luther and Erin Carlisle. Luther wants to sell the land to developers, while Erin wants to keep it in the family. Either way, the 'disease situation' may affect the plantation's future.The doctors in Zinnia do everything they can to treat the comatose patients, to no avail. Thus the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) sends two Ph.D. scientists to help. One of them - a gorgeous blonde named Bonnie Louise - immediately gloms onto Sarah Booth's ex-boyfriend, Sheriff Coleman Peters. Sarah Booth, who's dating a Hollywood actor, tells herself she doesn't care.....but she seems very concerned. \ud83d\ude11Though two trained scientists are now on the scene, Sarah Booth insists on investigating herself. The detective is determined to find out what's causing the disease, so she can save Oscar's life. (In real life, this would be ludicrous. Highly trained doctors and scientists can take years to identify the cause of a new disease. An amateur - who isn't even a biologist or physician - wouldn't have a chance. \ud83d\ude0f) In any case, Sarah Booth's other best friend - the fashionable transgender journalist Cece Dee Falcon - also offers to make inquiries. Sarah Booth's and Cece's interference leads to serious problems for both women. As all this is going on, Sarah Booth gets regular visits from her personal ghost Jitty, who haunts Sarah Booth's ancestral home, Dahlia House. Jitty is always changing her outfits, which is fun. She's also constantly pushing Sarah Booth to have a baby, which gets old. After considerable drama and trauma, everything is discovered in a climax I didn't predict.This is an enjoyable addition to the series, recommended to fans of cozy mysteries.

The \u201cghost\u201d in the series isn\u2019t a detective, but she\u2019s an intriguing character named Jitty, who pops up to offer words of advice and solace to the main character, Sarah Booth. (But only if she feels like it, of course.)Jitty, the resident haint of Dahlia House, gives new meaning to the word \u201cfeisty.\u201d She\u2019s fun, fearless, totally unpredictable and most importantly, she cannot be summoned at will. When she does pop up, usually wearing an outrageous costume, she invariably says something that\u2019s both witty and perceptive. Sometimes her comments \u201ddrive too close to home,\u201d as Sarah Booth ruefully admits and Jitty has a way of getting to the heart of the matter.This delightful series is set in Zinnia, Mississippi, but the eighth release, (Wishbones, Minotaur, June 2008 ) takes place in Costa Rica. A film company is doing a remake of Body Heat and Sarah Booth finds herself caught up in a murder mystery (as well as a romantic liaison.) The dialogue is crisp and lively and the description of the movie set is spot on.Ham Bones (Southern Belle Mysteries, Minotaur) June 2008, is another winner. When the New York cast of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof comes to Zinnia, Sarah Booth finds herself once again involved in a murder investigation, with the trusty Jitty providing ghostly guidance and support.Why are ghostly mysteries so popular? As Gail Link, romance writer (LUCK OF THE DRAW, Dorchester, 2006) and bookseller states, \u201cThese books have timeless qualities of love, loss and redemption. The ghostly detective is there to help, or work though something that was left unfinished on earth.\" For mysteries that have captivating characters, compelling plots and a touch of the supernatural, you won't want to miss this terrific series by Carolyn Haines."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1352473-lyn", "userReview": "Sara Booth Delaney and Tinkie Richmond are back in Zinnia, Mississippi where Tinkie's husband Oscar has succumbed to a plague-like illness that has even the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention stumped. Tinkie is afraid to leave Oscar's bedside. Sara Booth is on her own as she searches for clues that will help diagnosis this life threatening illness. Meanwhile, the number of victims increases.All the patients have in common is a visit to the Carlisle cotton plantation run by Agri-Team, a farming consortium. The cotton there is two feet tall while the rest of Sunflower County cotton is barely breaking ground. The Carlisle heirs are at odds about whether to sell the plantation to a land developer. Each accuses the other of prior bad acts, including murder.How does an unproven murder at the Carlisle Plantation fit in with an unknown illness, genetically altered cotton, and mutated boil weevils?

I got the feeling it flew off the keyboard and into the printing plant without an editor. What do editors do these days if they aren't actually editing books? This one has a lack of continuity-for instance, when Sarah Booth decides to go for a ride in the middle of the night, she \"whistles up her hound\" to go along, but the dog is never mentioned as accompanying her. Logic also is missing here-in her zeal to find out the cause of a deadly illness that's struck her best friend Tinkie's husband and three others, she goes without food and without sleep for days, and only once did she feed her horses and the dogs. I guess the author figured we'd be too busy figuring out who the dastardly criminal is to pay attention to little details like that. And lots of details are ignored in the mad dash to Find Out What's Going On.I'd think that experts from the Centers for Disease Control would be doctors-if not medical, then at least Ph.Ds, and the ones sent to Sunflower County are addressed as Ms. and Mr.. I had a very hard time believing that anyone who just survived a severe beating and a miscarriage (sorry if this is a spoiler for you but anyone could see that one coming a mile away), while having gone without food and sleep for days, would still have the strength to get out of a hospital bed and meet with a killer in an abandoned building without backup. It was a little too cartoonish for my taste. Sarah Booth has evolved into some kind of superhero P.I. who doesn't even have a P.I.'s license, yet she continues to ignore pleas to wait for the police, and rush headlong into the kind of situations where she could get herself and her friends killed. I just realized that I don't know what became of Bonnie Louise, and I don't care enough to pick the book back up and find out whether or not the author forgot to mention that little detail. Another problem I have with the series is the timeline-she keeps referring to the 18 months since she came back to Sunflower County, and in that time has had more than a half-dozen cases. Setting aside the idea that a sleepy little county in Mississippi could possibly have so many murderers and mysteries, that's an awful lot of exhausting cases in eighteen months. Most people don't even have the kind of adventures Sarah Booth has in their lifetimes. Then again, maybe that's part of the appeal-let a plucky heroine with a strange \"Delaney womb\" have the adventures for you while you read about it. I'm reading one more title that I got from the library, and after that I'm going to take a vacation from Sarah Booth for a while and see if it's my crankiness getting to me, or if my gripes about the books are right."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3445259-megan", "userReview": "I didn't set out to read this entire book yesterday, and yet I did. And I'm thinking of going to find another book in the series. I enjoyed the tone and characters in the book. I definitely think I'd like to read another one because this story line has the usual partners split up and the book is mostly Sarah Booth on her own (which I gather isn't the norm). It's hard to really judge the supporting characters based on this book alone. But that I want to read another one, that's a good sign.I did have one problem with this story though. I appreciate that there were a lot of \"who dunnit\" twists and turns at the end of the book (though, maybe one too many?) designed to keep you on your toes. I definitely never put the exact partnership of evil doers together myself. But here's the problem, while I didn't solve the mystery, it reads like that happened because the author hadn't either. Like maybe she just pulled two names out of the hat at the end of the book and Ta Da they did it. She definitely didn't explain the whys and hows of the final duo very well.There were too many coincidences that ALL the people involved had fabulous motivation to commit the crime but the ones who did it... didn't? What did they really hope to get out of this? How did they amass such a perfect team to lay the blame on? Could all the other characters' motivations really been at play and yet this is who did it? Just... we were left with too many questions after all this. And of course, the character I most want to have explain her why can't do so in the end. So that sucks.If what you are looking for a is a cozy book that reads like a light romp and distraction then this might work for you. (Despite the far from light subjects in it.)
