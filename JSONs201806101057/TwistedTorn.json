If you wanted another dose of Drake, you sure get it in this book. Theres so much that happens in this book I will not even go into detail. I can tell you that a lot happens for and to Chloe. She is really a likable chick, and some of the things that have happened to her are just plain sad. But she puts a smile on her face and trudges on, no pity needed. That's why I like her. Her mother, well we already know from Torn how evil she is. She gets what's coming to her in Twisted. You will also meet conniving skank bitch Kadi. I hated her! I was so onto her shit! But I like what happens to her too. Chloe isn't the victim in everything! Amber and Logan are in this book but not too much. They really are true friends, and how they help each other heal is truly heartfelt. You will get more of her cousin Danny and his BFF Jordan, who was Chloe's \"first\". What Danny goes through is so sad, and Jordan, well he for the most part had good intentions but got lost with them a few times. You still really like him anyway. The band, well you like them even more after this book. Now as for Drake....... You'll love him and hate him in this book. His demons come back to haunt him. He loves Chloe, you never doubt that, but boy does he screw up. In a way that makes you want to smack him because you know he's better than that. Things really did get a bit Twisted. Lots of growing and healing the place and Drake makes things right and make the reader happy :). Loved the epilogue. Very cute."}, {"userName": "Jenn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3349239-jenn", "userReview": "2.5 Fallen Stars I'm a bit disappointed with how this one turned out. I hate typing that however, I felt some of the drama was unnecessary. I also felt like some of the drama was recycled from book one. I would have loved for this one to:1. Focus solely on the mom drama. This could have lasted the entire book. and/or2. Focus on Drake's stardom and how that could have been an issue for the couple through out the book.Instead I felt like Drake lost his sweet and sexy charm. Also, I felt like Drake and Chloe acted very immature as well. I didn't like that something major happened to Chloe and how she hid the truth for a bit from Drake. As I didn't like that Drake did something and hid that as well. Both of their lies ended up causing the unnecessary drama that takes place the last part of the book. What Chloe does effects Drake's actions thanks to a third parties involvement. I really felt like we were over all the lies as we dealt with that in book 1. Anyway, I will continue on with the series so I can read Logan's book."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose", "userReview": "[***Chloe: Oh la la, my boyfriend and I are finally together, possibly forever even if I'm not of drinking age yet. His name is Drake and he's in a band and OMG he's so hot. We have sex, and it makes me happy, and it's so good to finally have something go right in my life after my tragic past with the abuse I suffered. But OMG, my aunt is dying and my mother's a bitch and soooo jealous that I could possibly come into a big inheritance and she won't get a single dime. I have to meet with my aunt before she dies to go over the details.Drake: I'm pretty well off too, but I'm worried about Chloe because her mom's a bitch, but I have to be on the road with my rock band and Chloe told me I shouldn't worry about her. I'm worried about the fact that she's reuniting with an old boyfriend, whose ass I would kick if Chloe hadn't assured me that things were fine. I'm on the road now, performing with my band, ran into an old girlfriend who's such a STALKER and just so happens to know Chloe's family. Chloe: Oh la, la. I'll send you a naked picture of myself on the phone. Better?Drake: Whaaaa? Oooooh. Oh crap, my bandmate accidentally saw her naked picture and I told him I would kill him if he mentioned it to Chloe. But Chloe's such a serious upgrade from the stalker bitch I used to date. Yeah!*Rose's note: Trust me, it gets worse than this.*Chloe: Oh, la, la, being without Drake is sooo lonely. And it's sad that I spend each moment with my dying aunt who's assure me that my mother will not get a single cent of her estate. When she dies, I ball into a corner and cry. The lawyer then meets with us and the estate's split between me and her children, but my mom's left with options to put her through a substance treatment program and an assurance that she will get nothing unless she goes through the program. While my cousins and me each get $600,000, my mom will only get $10,000, and only if she goes through the programs that are offered to her. My aunt's final message was for my mom to treat me better and not blame me for her circumstances. But OMG, the crazy bitch blames me for not getting her share of the inheritance. She tries to KILL me and beats me up and breaks my ribs. I end up in the hospital, but oh no, no, no - I can't tell Drake because then he'll be worried.*Rose's reaction: You'd think?!!!*Drake: I'm on the road with my band playing gigs and my old stalker bitch of a girlfriend calls me to say that Chloe's been cheating on me, and that she has proof because she went to Chloe's aunt's house and witnessed it first hand. Even after I told her to stay away from me and leave me the hell alone! But she keeps throwing herself on me! I told her even if Chloe's cheating on me, I don't want anything to do with her. Then she tells me \"You'll be sorry, Drake Allen!\"But all this stuff I did for Chloe and she doesn't even want me. Oh well, I guess that means I can go back to my life with my groupies...*Rose's reaction: Oh for the love of everything...*Drake: But no, I spent two days missing gigs from my band getting high as a kite and worrying everybody I knew. They even called Chloe to say I was missing. At first I had nothing to say and wanted nothing to do with Chloe, but then they said she left to try to find me and I got pissed. I saw Jordan, the \"friend\" she was supposedly staying with, and punched him.Chloe: Oh la, la - I'm so worried about Drake! Even after coming out of the hospital with broken and bruised ribs and a beat up face, I found him, but he's so upset.Drake: I'm so pissed that I confront Chloe about the damning pictures that my old stalker girlfriend (Kadi) took. She was practically hugging and in bed with Jordan, so I'm interested to see what she says about that. But it turns out he was just hugging her because she was upset about her aunt's death, and they were in bed because she had broken ribs and Jordan stayed with her because he was afraid her mom would come back and kill Chloe. I feel like an idiot. I didn't even see the bruises she had because she tried to hide them. And they looked bad...Chloe: Sorry.Drake: Sorry.Chloe: I can make it up to you by trying to give you a blowjob on the highway. Nevermind my ribs and the fact I have to take painpills for the pain, they're not that bad.Drake: Yaaaas. But wait, you're still in Jordan's arms even when we're on the road. This is not cool.Chloe: Stop being jealous! But OMG, you're with your groupies and taking drugs and WTF is wrong with you? Never mind that my mother killed herself! This is too much!Drake: Does it help if I ask to marry you? I promise I'll be better and I'm sorry I worried you. Please forgive me.Chloe: Yeah, sure! And I'll have your kid too!*** (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tonya", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4642570-tonya", "userReview": "Woohoo!!!!

The author used the exact same storyline as in Torn with the love triangle; except Logan is replaced by Jordan, Chloe's first. Her mom is back into her life and wants her to visit her aunt Jen who's dying from cancer and, from whom they are supposed to inherit a butt load of money. Her mom, Andrea, has to get Chloe to her sister's bedside to get her share. That's the only condition. So, now, Andrea is determined to make her daughter's life a living hell if she doesn't obey. Chloe accepts to make sure that she has a chance to talk to her aunt and convince her not to give money to Andrea.There, she sees her cousin Danny again and his best friend Jordan. While Drake goes on tour with the band and try to make a career in the music industry. Logan and Amber make an appearance or two in this book but that's it. It's mostly focused on the love triangle between Drake, Chloe and Jordan. Drake is jealous and handles his feelings the worst way possible. Besides, he has a stalker Kady who's ready to do anything to get him back... Chloe deals with her family issues the best she can and the rest on top of that. At least, she doesn't make the same mistakes. She's grown and is more mature. I had a lot more respect for her in Twisted. Drake on the other hand is the one to screw up. It makes for a good read but I was like, \"Come on, does everybody need to be so infatuated with Chloe? Come on!\". Andrea goes cray cray eventually and it provides some release from the love fest in the rest of the book. Most welcomed, dare I say.The ending, the happy ending, made me want to gag. But if I was to be honest, I'd say that I couldn't keep my phone away (kindle app) and was completely into Torn and Twisted.

RobinsonTwisted? More like \u2018Tail-spin.\u2019 A gripping and cleverly weaved sequel that will send you on a downward spiral. Hold on tight, because life is about to get a little, \u2018Twisted.\u2019I use the term \u2018downward-spiral\u2019 loosely, but in no uncertain terms do I mean the writing, I\u2019m referring to the scene after dramatic scene that shapes this page-turning sequel and one that has catapulted K.A. Robinson into the list of best-selling \u2018new\u2019 writers of 2013.Twisted has a totally different vibe to Torn. Whereas Torn was a college based love triangle between the \u2018best friend\u2019 and the \u2018promiscuous bad-boy lead rock vocalist.\u2019 Twisted takes Chloe and Drakes endeavours to a completely different level.*We knew that the beginning of Twisted was going to focus on the \u2018twisted\u2019 relationship between Chloe and her Mother, but I wasn\u2019t quite prepared to the level of which the author was going to take it. Child abuse is a subject that I find hard to swallow, even in a work of fiction and I found myself hating this woman with a passion, almost immediately. With the looming possibility that Chloe\u2019s Aunt is soon to lose her battle to cancer, she finds herself in a difficult position. Her Mother asks her to visit her sister with the promise that she will soon inherit a large fortune, if Chloe was to \u2018put in a good word,\u2019 and show that this one leopard has finally changed her spots. Chloe, wishing to see her dying aunt has no choice but to heed to her wishes. Seeing her Aunt, although sick, and her cousin Danny again reminded Chloe of \u2018good-times and better-days\u2019 and when Jordan, Danny\u2019s best friend and Chloe\u2019s ex-boyfriend makes a reappearance things easily fall back into a rhythm of old as the friends reconnect once more. With Drake\u2019s band ready to go out on the road and commence their tour, Chloe is left with Jordan and Danny to help care for her sick aunt. Then, that dreaded day arrives. With a funeral to plan, her alcoholic Mother disappearing for days and a jealous boyfriend, things start to take a tumble in Chloe\u2019s world as life starts to get very complicated.Things take an epic turn when the Will is read, and Chloe\u2019s Mum spits blood. With threats looming, an ex hook-up of Drake\u2019s on the stalker list and a friend with ulterior motives, it all starts to get too much.Drake is struggling with the gruelling tour schedule and a cold bed. He wants Chloe by his side, but she has a new rock in the form of Jordan, and Drake never was one to share. When \u2018Kadi the stalker\u2019 provides him with some damning evidence, Drake and Chloe\u2019s world is about to come crashing down and Drake only knows of one outlet, but one that could destroy them both, forever.*K.A. Robinson has done it again! I loved Torn, and Twisted certainly didn\u2019t disappoint. Her double POV unfolded effortlessly with each scene flowing on from the next with just enough angst to keep the reader entertained, but without unnecessary embellishment. The plot didn\u2019t drag and the dialogue was believable and witty, making this a riveting read that exuded a darker vibe than the first.The Epilogue was pure swoonworthy beauty, and on that basis alone, I think it\u2019s safe to say that Drakeyboy has definitely hit the book boyfriend list.

Sadly, my storm did come. Starting out as nothing more than a small rain cloud, it brought a hurricane with it, not just for me, but for Drake as well.\u201d\nThank goodness Twisted picks up right where Torn left off! With an ending like that, I had to jump right into this one because I absolutely HAD to know what would happen next.I\u2019m not going to spoil it for you because you need to read Torn in order to get the full effect of the \u201cstorm\u201d in which Chloe & Drake face. Not just hers but his as well. I will tell you this\u2026his storm did not sit well with me and I certainly lost a little \u201clove\u201d for Drake after reading this book.Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I still really loved the story and how everything unfolded, I just thought Drake to be a certain way after reading Torn and when I read Twisted\u2026\n\u201cDo you have feelings for him?\u201d\u2026\u201dAre you sure? Because I\u2019m not going to be a blind idiot like Logan was, living in my own blissful existence while you\u2019re off screwing around behind my back.\u201d\nWhere the HELL did that insecure, little man come from?!? I know love makes one do crazy things but never did Chloe give him any reason not to trust her. This made me angry because I loved that Drake had that strong (alpha-male), carefree, funny, we-can-face-the-world-together attitude. He lost it, big time, in this book\u2026and caved to his demons because of it. While it does make him more human and less fantasy, I really wasn\u2019t expecting it after reading the first book and let\u2019s just say it threw me for a loop. I do still love Drake (and Logan, Jordan & Danny too) but I wish his strength had held up; Chloe needed him and his vow to be there for her was broken. After I all but threw my kindle because of Drake\u2019s stupidity, he did something completely unthinkable and once again was very swoon-worthy! This story finished on a high note despite the challenges and heartbreaks, leaving me feeling content and even wistful. \n\u201cBefore I met Chloe, if someone had told me I would be down on one knee asking the woman I love to marry me, I would have kicked his ass.\u201d\nReading Twisted made me feel things I wasn\u2019t sure I would when the story began, I loved seeing things from both Chloe\u2019s and Drake\u2019s perspective. Although their weaknesses were brought front and center in this book, not once did I lose hope that all would work out in the end. Thank you K.A.

As long as the story line hooks me, I'm happy. I also want to say that I really enjoyed reading Torn, so I was excited to read Twisted as soon as it was released. Unfortunately, I think this book would have benefited from few more rounds of revisions on this one. The dialogue did not flow and the conversations were completely underdeveloped. I was so distracted by how disjointed the writing was, that I couldn't even enjoy the book. I was editing it in my head the entire time I read it. That does not make a fun reading experience.Every twist and dramatic turn was stated so explicitly, with no nuance or finesse that it truly felt like the type of story you would write in elementary school. It was so underdeveloped. I'm left wondering if the author dashed it off as quickly as possible to appease everyone who was excited to see what happened when Chloe's mom showed up & how it would play out for Drake & Chloe.I also had a problem with the same story line/drama of the love triangle being repeated in this book. This time instead of a Chloe-Drake-Logan triangle, it's Chloe-Drake-Jordan. Ugh.... Also, the ending. I felt like it needed so much MORE! It was so abrupt & did not leave me feeling like everything was resolved. The book was definitely filled with drama and I was happy to find out what came after Torn, but I am bummed that it really doesn't come close to the first one. I am torn between wanting to go back to re-read Torn to see if the writing was similar and I just didn't notice it, and afraid that re-reading it will be as difficult as reading Twisted was."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9432322-wendy", "userReview": "Damn I can't wait for this book!!

Seriously, go and buy it!!!I cannot even begin to describe just how much I enjoyed this book. It totally and completely blew me away!! Packed with even more drama and angst than the first one in the series, I wish I could go back in time are read both books all over again with a fresh pair of eyes!Picking up right where Torn (review) left off, Chloe comes face to face with her abusing mother for the first time in years. Determined to get \u2018her share\u2019 of her sister\u2019s money when she dies, Chloe\u2019s mum blackmails Chloe in to visiting her dying aunt in order to ensure that she gets her \u00a3600,000. Agreeing to go in order to get her mum out of her life, Chloe plans on telling her aunt about the kind of person her mum really is in order to ensure that she gets nothing, even if it does mean that she has to face her mum\u2019s anger. However, her mum\u2019s wrath isn\u2019t the only thing Chloe has to deal with, as her cousin\u2019s best friend Jordan develops feelings for her, and Drake starts to drift further and further away\u2026Chloe\u2019s life is especially dramatic in this book as she not only has to deal with her mum, but also the death of her aunt, and Drake\u2019s ongoing mood swings. Despite everything she goes through in this book, she always stays strong, and makes hard decisions to ensure that she does what\u2019s best for her while still trying to help everyone else. I really liked her in this book, and felt genuine sympathy for her over everything she had to go through.After the death of her mum you really see just how good a person Chloe really is. Always wishing good things for her mum, even when she was using drugs, abusing her and telling her how much she hated her, Chloe always hoped that one day she would get help and be the mother to her that she was supposed to be. It was extremely touching as even though her mum didn\u2019t deserve anything from Chloe, even the sadness over her death, Chloe still saw her as her mum and was truly upset when she died.I can\u2019t even think about Drake without my throat constricting a little bit, as every time it got on to a chapter from his POV I got a sinking feeling as he was self destructing more and more. Having battled with addiction in his past, after believing that Chloe was cheating on him with Jordan, he goes off the rails and his addiction comes back in full force. Even after everything is sorted out with Chloe he continues using, convincing himself that he will just finish what he has bought and then stop, but one bag is never enough and soon he can barely function without it.When on drugs, all of Drake\u2019s insecurities really showed through as he constantly worries about Chloe leaving him and hating her being around other men. The part when Drake lost it and started fighting with some random guy who just started talking to Chloe broke my heart, you could immediately tell that everything was coming to a head and was about to reach breaking point and although Drake clearly loved Chloe more than anything, he was pushing her away.The relationship between Drake and Chloe is rocky to say the least, but in a very subtle way. At the start of the story they seem like their unbreakable, but as Drake has to leave to join his band on tour things start to change. After the death of her aunt Chloe is looking for support and Jordan is there to comfort her, then after both an attack, and then the death of her mum, again Chloe needs someone, and as Drake is away getting high and she can\u2019t get a hold of him, again Jordan is there for her. Despite this Chloe lets this slide, and tries hard to believe Drake when she asks him where he has been. She clearly loves him more than anything and doesn\u2019t want to lose him.I generally liked Jordan as a character, despite the fact he clearly didn\u2019t like Chloe being with Drake, I could totally see it from his point of view as he was only trying to protect her. He was always so sweet, caring and protective of Chloe, even after she told him that she didn\u2019t feel the same way about him. I would really love to hear a story about Jordan as I thought he was such a genuinely nice character and I would like to see him get his happy ending.In my opinion this whole series is right up there with Easy, Beautiful Disaster, and the Thoughtless series and would HIGHLY recommend this series if you have read any of these books. I can not fault them one bit and if anything the only thing I\u2019m not happy about is that Drake and Chloe\u2019s story is over because I would LOVE to read more about them. Luckily Logan\u2019s story \u2018FORBIDDEN\u2019 is set to be released in July 2013 ~ can\u2019t wait!!5 GINORMOUS stars!!"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5654159-kim", "userReview": "4.5 starsBoth my happiest and my most painful moments seemed to revolve around one person though. Drake. Even saying his name brought a smile to my face. There was no one who had touched my life the way he had. When we had our lows, they were horrible, a whirlwind of pain and regret. But our highs, oh they could bring me to my knees with joy. ...I knew that we were meant to last, that he would stand by my side through any storm I was forced to face. Sadly, my storm did some. Starting out as nothing more than a small rain cloud, it brought a hurricane with it, not just for me, but for Drake as well. Oh my! This book had me all twisted and in knots! I loved Chloe and Drake in Torn and was ready for them to have a little happy time. Ding Dong, the doorbell rings and that was it! Chloe is sucked back into the whirlwind that is her crazy mother and ends up back at her Aunt's house with her cousin and his best friend Jordan. Danny is a sweetheart and you cannot help but like him and be glad that Chloe has someone in her family that cares for her. Jordan is a hot, musclebound football player that shares a past with Chloe and still has strong feelings for her. He is a good friend, protective, and caring...but also territorial. Drake and the band have to go on tour. And the drama begins...\"You mean the world to me baby, I hope you know that. I feel like I'm complete when I have you around and I don't want this time apart to change anything about us. I don't think I'd survive without you, now that I've found you.\"There are separations, misunderstandings, danger, jealousy, drama, insecurities, meddling exes, outside pressures,and past problems that just wreak havoc on this poor couple. I spent the whole book biting my nails as situations spiraled out of control. Through it all, I really came to like Chloe so much more than I liked her in Torn. She is now strong, devoted, and knows what she wants. She has grown up so much since the first book. Drake...oh how I love Drake...but I cannot lie...I wanted to throttle him a few times in this book. He definitely still had some demons to face. It seemed we just kept going round and round in an emotional whirlwind.\"...I thought I lost the one person that I truly loved and couldn't deal with it.\"\"I love you Jake...I'm in so deep with you, I don't think I'll ever surface. But I'm ok with that. If I'm going to drown, I want it to be with you.\"\"Do you know how corny we sound? I think I just threw up a little.\"I wanted more than anything to wipe it away, but I knew she wouldn't let me. That wall she used to keep people away was up and this time it was for me. I hated to think that I had hurt her to the point where she would never let me in again. I seriously did not think my poor heart could take anymore. And finally we came to the end of this emotional roller coaster... and I am always happy to have an epilogue in a book. KA Robinson plans to have at least 5 more books in this series focusing on the secondary characters Jordan, Logan, Danny, Adam, Eric, Jade, and Amber. I still love Amber and Logan is back in my good graces. I like the band members and that we got to get a little more attached to them in this book. Her cousin Danny certainly deserves some happiness. And Jordan would be great, if he was not after Chloe. I think I could love him with someone else. I am really looking forward to more in this series. I really enjoy KA Robinson's writing style. It moves effortlessly, you get both POV, and you can feel the emotions of her well developed characters. Will be posted at Reviews by Tammy and Kim."}, {"userName": "Kendall {Book Crazy}", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11385469-kendall-book-crazy", "userReview": "This book was so much better than the first one! As much as I loved the first one I loved this one more! At times this book felt like the first book of a series to me as it had that potential apart from Chloe and Drake already having a relationship but I loved that! I also thought that I knew what was going to happen after the massive ending to Torn so I thought I knew what to expect but what I got was so much more! Twisted really was an amazing book and it completely blew me away! I also loved that you could tell that the author started to feel more comfortable with writing and the characters as Torn was only her first novel! The plot continued straight on from where Torn left off from and I loved it! So much happened in the plot and at times it made my head spin! The plot got quite dark at some scenes and I felt myself feeling more emotion with the characters during their darkest hours! I think that Twisted had the right amount of romance, suspense and plot development to make it phenomenal! The characters were even better in this book than what they were in Torn! I adored all of them! I loved Chloe in this book! I wasn't so sure about her after the impression she left me with in Torn but she really impressed me in this book! My opinion of her completely changed in this book as she was so much easier to connect with! As it was a lot easier for me to connect with her in this book then I enjoyed reading from her point of view more and I also felt like she was a completely different person as she had grown so much! My heart went out to Drake in this book! He went through a lot in this book and it was hard for me to watch him go through it! I really felt for Chloe as well as she was kept in the dark for so long about how bad Drake had gotten! I adored Drake and Chloe as a couple in Torn but I loved them even more as a couple in Twisted as there was a love triangle in this book between Chloe, Drake and Jordan! I was completely Team Drake but at times I did have a teeny, tiny soft spot for Jordan! I loved that Twisted was written from both Chloe and Drake's point of views as this was definitely essential as there was so much going on and at times in the book there was two different stories happening! The ending was beyond amazing! I was sort of expecting the ending but I adored that the author made it absolutely beautiful! I am really sad to let Chloe and Drake go as I loved their relationship but I am really excited to read more from K.A. Robinson as this series is definitely one of my favourites! I also love the cover for Twisted as it really suits the first cover to this series! Big thank you K.A. Robinson and to Shh Mom's Reading for having me on the Blog Tour!"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13126896-michelle", "userReview": "Twisted starts off just where Torn ends. Chloe's mom is at Drake's door...after realizing that she won't go away Chloe hears her out. Her aunt is dying and she wants to see Chloe before she passes. But her mother has her own motives. Getting her hands on her dying sister's money is at the top of her list and she needs Chloe in order to accomplish it.Chloe and Drake were days away from setting out for his tour, but they make their way to her aunt's house first. Things are looking up for Drake and Chloe - all the drama of Logan is behind them and they seem to be ready to give their love the proper shot. But throw in Jordan who took Chloe's virginity and Drake is seeing red. Drake has been sober for four years, but after thinking the worst he is thrown back into the world of drug use. Able to hide it from his band and Chloe doesn't last and their relationship is tested when she walks away. Now this where I had my only issue with the story. We get a fast forward of 6 months and within a few words things are all fixed...I just expected there to be more of a fight to win her back. It just felt rushed, I understand that the time apart did not make her fall out of love with him - but it just seemed like there should have been more involved with the whole forgiveness scenes...Drake was his typical sweet self until he lost faith and trust in Chloe, reacting without talking it out with her led him to go back to his old ways of numbing himself. Now we all loved the Drake in Torn, this Drake was just as sweet but more broken - which just makes us swoon a bit more. We love our boys battered and broken. I enjoyed this sequel but it fell short for me from Torn, which I loved. I am not sure if it was just that so much was thrown at me in this book and the reunion was just so fast that it put me off a bit or if it was just a mood issue...but I wished this had just a bit more of a punch. I got my HEA but after all the drama of the first 90% of the book I really needed more than a few pages of bliss to put me at ease.I look forward to Logan's book though and reading more of K.A. Robinson's books."}, {"userName": "Cari Sury (Girl+Book Love Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8041968-cari-sury-girl-book-love-blog", "userReview": "**See more of my reviews at www.girlbooklove.com!This book is like a rollercoaster in so many ways. Emotionally, you will be up and down. You will love Drake and Chloe one moment, the next you\u2019ll hate them. You will most likely want to punch them at least once. Then, when you\u2019re getting towards the end and you\u2019re so frustrated you aren\u2019t even sure you can finish\u2026they redeem themselves and it\u2019s all smooth sailing from there! This book picks up where Torn, book 1, left off. Chloe is dealing with \u201cmomma drama\u201d and her aunt is dying. Chloe and Drake head to Ocean City so she can see her aunt and make sure her mother isn\u2019t given any money after her aunt passes. We meet Chloe\u2019s cousin, Danny, and their friend, Jordan. Drake doesn\u2019t like how Jordan flirts with Chloe and doesn\u2019t handle it well. Obviously, Chloe and Drake\u2019s relationship is very intense. While sometimes this is totally ok, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always healthy\u2026.even if you think it is\u2026.\u201cShe was my newest coping mechanism, and by far the healthiest. With Chloe, I felt alive again for the first time in so long.\u201dBut LIFE happens, and people can\u2019t stay plastered to each other\u2019s sides for forever. What happens when that super intense relationship is tested? Chloe and Drake deal with a bat shit crazy mother and ex-girlfriend, deaths in the family, Drake being away on tour and Chloe\u2019s old flame in this book. (rollercoaster, anyone?) I felt so dragged down towards the end of the book, that I was really glad for the 6 month jump! (I love when books do this) It really brought a brightness back to the story that it needed. While, if it had been me, I think I would\u2019ve made Drake work a little harder. That would probably be my only complaint. The epilogue though is super sweet! \u201cAren\u2019t you going to kiss me or something now? You\u2019re not very good at this, you know.\u201d \u201cI was getting to that part, smart-ass.\u201d**I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Debra Presley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12224389-debra-presley", "userReview": "4.25/4.5--addicted to Drake--stars\nFollow Me:www.thebookenthusiast.netwww.facebook.com/thebookenthusiastTwisted is the second book in the Torn Series (Torn) by K.A. Robinson. In Twisted we get more of Drake and Chloe. Another book that will drive you crazy...at times I was yelling at my screen and wanting to jump in there and slap a few people. Besides all the yelling I shed a few tears and had a couple of laughs. It's a great combination of emotions.Chloe and Drake have this awesome relationship that is solid and no one can come between them. Right? Well mommy dearest is back and she has some other plans. This bitch is CRAZY!With the arrival of Chloe's mom it sets off a chain of events that just had me flipping out! Drake and Chloe try their best to make it through all the crap that is thrown their way but outside influences and past demons come creeping into their relationship. Will it all be too much? Will they be able to dodge it all?Twisted is the perfect title for this book because my stomach was twisted in knots. There are a few things that happen in this book that come out of left field and then there are other things that you can sort of see the writing on the wall but can do nothing but sit back and FLIP out!!!There is NO doubt that Chloe and Drake have the steam and attraction but do they have the stamina to make it through all life has to throw at them? Will they be able to survive the antics of mommy dearest and oh yeah, all those things that happen that you just won't see coming??Overall awesome read! Some slow spots for me when I compare it to Torn but still just as addicting as the first book.

Twisted.Twisted was Absolutely amazing. It starts out exactly where Torn ended and it takes your emotions on a ride from start to finish. K.A. Robinson has a way of drawing me in and making me feel the emotion that her characters are feeling. I had a love/hate relationship with a majority of the them. I still love all the members of Drake's band as well as Amber and Logan. I hope that there will eventually be books for Danny and Jordan. I need to know their stories too. Chloe's mom, well lets just say that I was happy with how the book ended for her. I adored Chloe in this book. I might have handled a few situations differently than her but she certainly didn't make me want to scream like she did in Torn. Drake. oh my, Drake! My emotions felt the strongest while reading about him. I wanted to jump inside the book and hug him, love him, slap him, scream at the top of my lungs at him. I cried for him.

I LOVED Torn (book1) so much that I really have to say that I was slightly disappointed with this book. My biggest complaint was it felt like all the drama between Drake, Chloe and Jordan was a replay of book 1 with Logan. I figured since that was the main drama in book 1 we wouldn't see it again in book 2. I also didn't like Drake in this book as much and that really PAINS me to say that because I loved him in book 1. I understand why he changed in Twisted but I really did miss the sweet and lovable Drake. I will say that I did like Chloe better in Twisted because she stood up for herself better and didn't make as many dumb decisions. I will say that I felt so bad for her in this book with everything her mom did to her. I was extremely glad to see that her mother finally got what was coming to her. Overall I am glad that I read this book, I just wish we would've seen a happier Chloe and Drake in this book without all the triangle drama. I will definitely continue on with this series because I can't wait to see what happens to Logan, Danny, Jordan, Eric, Adam, Jade and Amber.

This book took me on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Chloe continued to piss me off with her dumb decisions in the beginning. However she was extremely strong toward the end of the book and made some very hard decisions and stuck to them. And Drake! This time he was an idiot! He infuriated me at times. But I really enjoyed all the emotions it pulled from me. Along with all these dreaded emotiins was playful banter between Chloe and Drake that I loved! I really liked the supporting characters in this series and glad they will get their stories told too. I can't wait for Adam's and Jade's especially.
