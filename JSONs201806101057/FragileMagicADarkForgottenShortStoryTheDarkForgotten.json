I\u2019d love to see more of Selina, Jake, and Gary. And I\u2019ll gladly be diving into the rest of the world of The Dark Forgotten, which is sure to be just as fascinating."}], "description": "A short story in the Dark Forgotten universe! No furry friend is too unusual. The sign on the local veterinarian clinic should be warning enough. Fine art dealer Selina Pearson doesn\u2019t embrace the extraordinary, or messy, or chaotic, and the last thing she needs is the injured baby gargoyle she rescues from the cereal display in the grocery store. Dr. Jake Hallender is a smoking hot veterinarian and leader of the local werewolf pack. Selina\u2019s focused on her career in a prestigious art gallery, but Dr. Jake\u2019s bedside manner is a masterpiece in itself. Things go from frisky to fabulous before she can summon the will to refuse. But bliss only lasts so long. Jake is the healer, but his pack needs Selina\u2019s fey talents to thrive. Revealing her powers will cost Selina everything, and then what? Can she trust the fragile magic they\u2019ve built between them?", "title": "Fragile Magic: A Dark Forgotten Short Story (The Dark Forgotten)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36233495-fragile-magic", "average": 4.1, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1505312141l/36233495.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1880316.Sharon_Ashwood", "name": "Sharon Ashwood"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36233495-fragile-magic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36658460-ravenous", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289933-scorched", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9689046-frostbound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7095653-unchained", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20414163-possessed-by-a-warrior"]}
