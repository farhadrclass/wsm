My family is comprised mostly of hard-working European immigrants who value education above all else. In many ways, I should be the last person able to appreciate or understand life in small-town Texas with its conservative values and its unhealthy obsession with high school sports. Yet, I actually did attend a private junior/senior high school with a hockey program that is probably the best in the country. We won the state championship every single year of my six years there, which was in fact part of a twenty-six year streak of consecutive titles. Dozens upon dozens of students from my school have been drafted by the NHL. So perhaps the whole concept of \u201chigh school sports are the most important thing you\u2019ll ever do in your life and enjoy it because it is all downhill from there\u201d shouldn\u2019t be so foreign to me after all.But nope, it is still foreign to me. Very foreign.This book reminds me of about a handful of John Mellencamp songs that praise the glory days of youth and that try to recall a feeling of nostalgia for a simpler time and place. Mostly I feel sorry for anyone who actually identifies with any of that, as it just perpetuates the nonsense that one will spend the majority of his life with his best days behind him. To me that\u2019s a bit pathetic. This book, though, is a complete embodiment of the Mellencamp philosophy. It is the story of the 1988 football season of Permian High School in Odessa, Texas. It is the story of the town itself, insular and deeply rooted in social conservatism, unabashedly ignorant of the larger national political scene, and seriously, seriously racist. Oh my God, how racist. But above it all, town pride for its high school football team shines through\u2014pride that is fundamental to its nature, to its identity.\nNo connection in all of sports was more intimate than this one, the one between town and high school.\nOn the surface, the intensity with which the townspeople of Odessa embrace their high school football team is rather endearing. It gives the kids something to do on a Friday night; it gives them something to work for and to be proud of. But as the author delves further, the intensity starts to seem a little grotesque. These people depend on high school football to survive. More than just an escape from the financial ruin that has set in since the Texas oil bust, high school football is the only thing that matters. They live vicariously through these teenagers, these children, as if they are somehow their only connection to anything good or right in the world. That\u2019s a pretty heavy burden for a 17 year-old to bear. And more than that, these 17 year-olds start to believe it themselves\u2014that there\u2019s nothing else for them beyond high school football. They are hit in the head with this concept over and over again as very little concern is shown for their academic progress. To their peers, their teachers, their counselors, their parents, town officials, and to basically everyone else in their sheltered world, high school football is the most important thing they will ever have.And yet as sad as this is, I found myself getting caught up in it: the excitement, the rush, the adrenaline of the game. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s dangerous to glamorize something that should really only represent a small part of someone\u2019s life, but it was easy to understand how one could get wrapped up in it. I think this book is worth reading. I think it\u2019s important. And I don\u2019t think you need to be a high school football fan, or even a sports fan in general, to appreciate it.\nPermian High School Panthers: 1988 Football Season\nvs. Palo Duro Dons \u2014 LOSS (Pre-Season)vs. El Paso Austin \u2014 WINvs. Marshall Mavericks \u2014 WINvs. Odessa High Bronchos \u2014 WINvs. Midland High Bulldogs \u2014 WINvs. Abilene High Eagles \u2014 WINvs. Dallas Jesuit \u2014 WINvs. Cooper Cougars \u2014 WINvs. Midland Lee Rebels \u2014 LOSSvs. San Angelo Central Bobcats \u2014 WIN_________________________vs. Amarillo Tascosa Rebels \u2014 WIN (Post-Season)vs. Andress Eagles \u2014 WIN (Post-Season)vs. Irving Nimitz Vikings \u2014 WIN (Post-Season)vs. Arlington Lamar Vikings \u2014 WIN (Quarter-Finals)vs. Carter Cowboys \u2014 LOSS (Semi-Finals)\nDon\u2019t mess with Texas."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307364-paul", "userReview": "I was on an airplane one Friday night when I was reading this book. As the plane took off from Cleveland I noticed a high school football game in progress. I could see the lights.. the two teams on the field.. the crowd and the marching band. I watched the field as long as I could. Just at the point when I couldn't see the stadium anymore my eye caught the lights of another football field. Then.. when I looked out over the countryside I noticed that there were football games in most of the small towns we were passing.

I played along, and ended up reading an Amish romance and this sports book. One reading friend talked about this book on an episode of the Reading Envy podcast and made it sound pretty compelling, sports or no sports.\"You'd watch these kids play, and it seem like somethin' burning would be inside of you and want to come out.\"And it is compelling. Enough that they made a movie and a television show based on the book (neither of which I've seen.) It isn't just about football, but about social order, small town culture, racism, new money, the education system, conservatism, etc. I freely admit that I read the non-sportsing parts more closely than any play by play scenes (of which there were few, thankfully.)\"We fit as athletes, but we really don't fit as a part of society... We know that we're separate, until we get on the field. We know that we're equal as athletes. But once we get off the field we're not equal. When it comes time to play the game, we are a part of it.

There is a fair amount about football, but this book is really a sort of sociological study of a small Texas town where Football is played. There is a lot about the difficulties of the local economy after the oil slump, and in general the book gives what I thought was a fairly negative view of the people and their preoccupations. I almost never like movies better than books, but in this case I thought the movie did a really excellent job of cutting out the boring parts of the book and of bringing out the good qualities and the passion of the locals instead of focusing more on negatives."}, {"userName": "Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32865-taylor", "userReview": "I didn't grow up in a football-watching family. My father, who apparently loved the game, passed away when I was young. My mother was much more interested in baseball, and had coworkers with season tickets, so I grew up going to the Kingdome to watch Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Joey Cora, Edgar Martinez, Jay Buhner, Dan Wilson... I even spent my high school prom night at Safeco Field, watching Freddy Garcia pitch a great game against the Yankees (who he'd eventually join, years later, sigh) instead of going to the dance. My high school football team certainly wasn't any good, and had I'd known that my college football team (Hofstra) would eventually a) have so many pro-level players, and b) get entirely nixed a few years after I'd graduated, I might've gone to more than one game. Maybe.I came to football late in life, and have grown to love the game for any number of reasons. My knowledge of football certainly has a ways to go, still, but I do admit to being a total sucker for player stories and backgrounds - it's part of the reason why I fell in love with the Seahawks when Pete Carroll and John Schneider came along and shook things up - they found themselves a bunch of guys who were hungry to prove themselves, who'd been told over the course of their careers that they weren't good enough. If you saw this year's Super Bowl, you know how that worked out.I say all of this because while I love football now, if you'd have told me a few years ago that I'd fall so in love with a book about football, I probably would not have believed you. But the thing is that the television show version of \"Friday Night Lights\" has a lot to do with why I opened my eyes to football to begin with, because much like Friday Night Lights the book - it's about so much more than football. Friday Night Lights takes place in Odessa in the '80s, which becomes its own sort of character - an oil-boom town that never quite recovered from the bust, full of people living it up, thinking they were invincible... but then that whole business in the middle east was sorted out, and gas prices dropped off, and millionaires and banks in Texas found themselves broke.Odessa was also dealing with its own particularly stagnant brand of race relations in the '80s, so much so that they had segregated schools for so long that eventually the government came in and said, \"No, really, you can't do this anymore.\" But of course, once they realized that Black people were good at football, they were far more accepting, and drew town lines based on what demographic of people lived where (so that Permian could get more Black people). Yikes.Most of all, Friday Night Lights is about the team and the coaches of Permian - the character traits and flaws that brought them failure and success, the single moments in games that came to define them, the dreams they held of greatness and the reality of life post-football, the toxicity of being held on a pedestal at such a young age contrasted with the question of, if they hadn't had football to be great for, then what?Even though I totally understand why Bissinger uses the distinguished H.G. at the front of his name, a part of me wished he used his nick-name, \"Buzz,\" because it perfectly describes his prose. His writing is just teeming with energy, with life, like the humming of a street light or a telephone wire. Bissinger shines when he's writing about people - their hands, the way that they eat, the look in their eye - you feel as though you've met them before.I also was a bit sad by the fact that the most recent time I remember Bissinger being in the news was when he wrote about his shopping addiction - it made for a rather depressing juxtaposition when he was writing about issues of class and economics in Friday Night Lights so gut-wrenchingly well. At the same time, though, there's clearly something in him that deeply identifies with some of the bigger picture issues here - the striving for something seemingly greater, wanting to fill some kind of void. If he uses designer suits instead of football, I suppose that's just his poison of choice.Whether your interest in the sport falls at zero or 100%, Friday Night Lights is an incredible look at the role that sports play in a community - the good and the bad - and an incredible study of Odessa, the '80s, the educational system, high school kids... so much more than just football - but plenty of that, too.Update, Oct. 28: Continuing my \"watching the movies of the books I've read this year\" project, as I'm also a big film lover, I watched the movie adaptation of this, though I'd seen it before. The main problem is that this book is about so many things - the history of the town, the lives of the people in it, and obviously, football. To distill the book to just the football portions is to miss a lot of the point - which is by no means the movie's fault, since that's the most adaptable aspect. But, having read the book, I can see why making the film was not totally satisfying for Berg, and why he went on to make a TV show about it - there's just too much under the surface to get into during a two-hour film. The movie is much more faithful to the book than the TV series, which is more \"inspired by\" the people and the place as it is loyal to the story of anything that actually happened. Still, even though it's not connected to the story in the book at all really, the TV show does capture the same spirit, the idea that football is what gives this run-down town a purpose and a dream, what gives these people hope and possibly a chance to escape, or at least gives them glory days to wax poetic about when they've put away a six-pack..."}, {"userName": "Shirley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35683-shirley", "userReview": "It's not a surprise that I loved this book. It is about high school football. I watched a lot of football growing up (Friday nights: high school football; Saturday: University of Colorado football; Sunday: NFL football - I was a huge 49ers fan). I probably could have done something great with all the hours I spent watching football. Ah well. My high school football team won the state championship, and I remember it as a glory day - it was snowing, the team was playing in then-Folsom Field (the University of Colorado football field). I had rushed back from Denver to see the game, having taken only 2 out of a possible 3 standardized subject tests (now called the SAT2?) so that I could get back in time for the game. Because of this book (which I first read about 8 or 9 years ago), I watched the FNL TV series, which is my favorite TV series (with the caveat that I don't really watch TV outside of HGTV and ESPN). Then I named my son Dylan, and I think I've mentioned elsewhere that it didn't hurt that his name was a phonetic homage to Dillon, Texas, the fictional town where the FNL show takes place... Anyway. I argue that, even if you are not a sports fan, you will be riveted. Those in my book club, all women, half of whom had no interest in football, all enjoyed it (although some confessed they skipped the play-by-play descriptions of the games in the book). This book clearly lays out the cultural and social context in which high school football was revered over all else. Odessa was in a downturn in the oil boom-and-bust cycle. Odessa schools didn't racially integrate until the 1980s (Brown v Board of Education was decided in 1954), and then there was football-motivated gerrymandering of school lines, effectively sending most of the African-American running backs to Permian High rather than to its rival crosstown high school. Unemployment was high. All this was forgotten under the lights of a Friday night if the Permian Panthers won before 20,000 people whose greatest hopes and dreams rested on a bunch of 15- to 18-year-olds.To be on the Permian Panthers football team (at least in the 80s, when this was written) was to be king. For girls, the next-best thing was to date a football player or be a Pepette - the personal cheerleader of a designated football player - to bring him homemade cookies before games and put banners on his front lawn with his jersey number. The Panthers coach was God if he won the game that Friday night. If the team lost, he knew he could count on having \"For Sale\" signs put into his front lawn. If the team lost twice in a season, he would not be surprised to lose his job. Eighth graders who hoped to play for the Panthers some day would be lauded for playing through their league games with a broken arm. At a rival high school, teachers would slip football players the answers to the exams so that they could maintain the minimum GPA required to play football. Several of these players, having secured college football scholarships, then decided to go into armed robbery. Having been raised to believe that consequences did not apply to them, they were honestly shocked when the judge sentenced them to lengthy prison terms. High school football in Texas is life. If that seems crazy to you, you may be persuaded otherwise after reading this book."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23315273-carol", "userReview": "If you love football, Friday Night Lights likely will be the best sports book you've ever read.

I had only heard of it on blogs before then and never really paid any attention to it.Wow, was I late to the party. The television show is excellent and I highly recommend it, even if you don't like football.Being the bookworm that I am, I had to find the inspiration for the television show. I actually bought a copy of the book for my friend Matt for Christmas and the four of us eventually decided to read the book and have a little book discussion afterwards.The book is a fast read and is mostly enjoyable. The parts that are not enjoyable are mainly because of the subject matter and now the writing. Reading about the town of Odessa, TX is very difficult because the society there is completely foreign to me. There are times when you want to shake the book and say, \"What is WRONG with you?\" Many of those moments happened, for me, when there were detailed descriptions of academics being flushed down the tubes in favor of football.Overall, though, the writing is good. Bissinger can be a bit over the top at times, though. He uses hyperbole and metaphor a bit too much, but he creates a solid image in your mind of what this town, this school, this team is really like. The hard part is accepting the fact that there really is a place like Odessa that has all these problems."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-chris", "userReview": "Dear Mr. Bissinger,I think watching the Intelligent Squared debate you were in is great.

I felt sick to my stomach reading it.I played football in high school in a place where there was much more than high school football for most people to do on a Friday night. I can relate to some aspects of the story: football games were the only sporting events in my school where admission was charged, they drew probably five times the attendees of any other sport, and we wore our jerseys proudly to school on pep rally days and were probably afforded more attention as a result of being on the team. I can recall all the feelings the author describes as a player, from fear/dread of an unknown opponent to the drive to smash someone on the opposing team, not just to tackle them but to make them feel pain and fear and not want to line up against you the next play. (High school boys are basically emotional basket-cases, what with all the hormones and the expectations they heap on themselves.)But it just makes me feel sick inside to read about these kids who come from a nothing little town in the middle of nowhere, kids who have, with a few exceptions, little going for them whether or not their season ends in championship or ignominy. These kids (and at seventeen or eighteen, they are absolutely children) are lifted up as the focal point for an entire town, are worshipped and glorified and girded for battle as if their conquests mean something. And the really terrible thing is that they fundamentally don't.That's not to say that I think sports are meaningless when growing up--nothing of the sort. I played in lots of sports as a kid and I think they teach you incredibly valuable lessons about working with others, dealing with stress, anticipation, frustration, victory (yes, that's challenging too) and defeat, and they develop camaraderie, mental resilience and lots of other important character traits. But, crucially, they do those things whether you end up as the state champion or at the bottom of the standings, provided that coaches, parents and kids keep their focus in the right place.The story of Permian high is so clearly one where everyone, from the school administrators and teachers to the parents to the local businesspeople and boosters to the college recruiters to the former players to the kids themselves have completely lost sight of what the goal of student athletics should be--building the student (as a person), not the trophy case. The least of the blame falls here falls on the players themselves...I just don't know how anyone could expect them to behave otherwise when every aspect of their upbringing has been preparing them for this moment, and everyone, in ways large and small, has been telling them all their lives that winning isn't everything, it's the only thing. It's a wonder that several of them made it out to conduct relatively normal lives.What is absolutely terrifying to me reading this book is how many people, the author included, seem caught up in the spell of what is at its heart a completely meaningless event. I say this as someone who loves sports--loves watching them, loves playing them, loves arguing about them--: sports are meaningless. It's one of the reasons we can love them so much in the first place, because they are the one place in life we feel totally free to be irrational. (As in, I hate the guy on the other side of the field because his jersey has a different logo on it than the logo that I like best.) Sports appeal to our basest instincts, to identify with a group and pit ourselves against \"not-us\", whoever that might be. I can't tell you how many times I've been on a team, be it baseball, football, track, soccer or anything else and we've found ways not just to oppose the other team, but to revile them--to question their motives, to accuse them of poor sportsmanship, to look for any character trait or action which will let our team feel like it has the moral high ground. That's not just a feature of organized sports either--it happens in pickup games of basketball and in random pool games at the bar. We love to demonize the people we play against.And we love to invest meaningless competitions with an almost sacred significance. What difference does it make to the US economy or world peace or anything else of lasting significance if my kids beat the neighbor kids in tag football at the local park? Nothing. But there is fundamentally no difference between that and the Super Bowl, except that we've all agreed that it has significance, so much so that it generates billions of dollars in economic activity around the world every year.The same public religion is on display in the book, except that in Odessa, TX where the book's events take place, football is a preoccupation that consumes the whole town every year during football season and beyond. It's heartbreaking to read the several direct quotations from Odessa residents who say, effectively, \"Without Permian football I wouldn't have a reason to live.\" It crowds everything else out to where education is an afterthought, and no matter how the last season ends, everyone is left reminiscing and wishing for just one more hit of the adrenaline drug, the taste of glory. The fact that it's set against the backdrop of objectively one of the least desirable places to live in the United States just makes that sense of futile longing even more pathetic. (Pathetic in the sense of pathos--I feel terrible for just about everyone in this story.)I don't really know what else to say about this book. The writing is excellent. The author touches on issues of race, class, divisions within the city, impacts of the mid-80's slump in oil prices on the town's economy. Putting aside football, the race issue is disturbing in itself, and he unflinchingly reveals the prejudice and outright bigotry that existed in that community at the time. (It must be said that this is clearly not just a feature of Odessa, TX in 1988.) The economic story is interesting as well, but ultimately I found it less compelling--there are lots of places in the US that have experienced economic downturns, and they didn't turn to cult worship of the local high school football team. What a petty, pathetic god before which to kneel.Anyway, I feel like I got rather preachy with this review, but this book disturbed me so deeply. So, kudos to the author. I understand why the town (and probably most of West Texas) hated the book, but sometimes a mirror can be an ugly thing to look at."}, {"userName": "Sera", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/576203-sera", "userReview": "Great book that Bissinger wrote while embedded with the 1988 Permian Panthers and living for a year with his family in Odessa, Texas. Bissinger's book not only focuses on the high school football team's quest to win state, but he also provides an understanding of the people who make up the town, its history, and their views on everything from politics to race. For those people who are looking to understand white people in rural America who are likely Trump voters, I found that this book provided more insight that many of the books that have attempted to address that subject in present day.

I wanted to feel like I was in the town and one of the football players.\"Clear eyes. full heart. Can't lose\" - Coach Taylor I like this quote because it's the team motto and the players love saying it. This quote meaning be a proud Permian football player and putting pride into being on that team means that they can't lose if they play their hardest.\tThe essential question it relates to I personally think is. What turning points determine our path to adulthood? I think being a Permian football player means you are going to be in the town of Odessa for your life you just want to keep watching the team you played for. Their isn't much work in the city but the people take pride in what they do. Being on that team means everything to the town and the players who are on or used to be on that team.\tI recommend this book for kids that are in high school. I feel like that's the best time to read it when you are actually in high school you understand what's going on you have a better grasp on the book.

Bissinger was born in New York City in November of 1954. He spent time writing for the Philadelphia inquirer. Friday Night Lights by H.G. Bissinger is about a small town in Texas called Odessa. Permian High school football is a way of life and almost every kid dreams of wearing the black and white under Friday night lights some day. Permian\u2019s goal in the 1988 season was to reach the state championship. The competition is high and the road is tough, but will they find a way to get it done?\tWhat I found interesting in the novel Friday Night Lights was the descriptions of the characters and the setting. For example, in the beginning of the novel they described Odessa (the town) and Boobie Miles (star running back) extremely well. The descriptions were always clear, and I felt like I knew the characters and I lived in the Odessa. I also found the point of view changes very interesting. In the novel there were many point of view changes; in one chapter the point of view was from Boobie Miles. But the next was from a former Permian High player from the 1960\u2019s. Next I found that the language was interesting because the novel was based in Texas and some words I have never seen before or spelled differently. For example morning was spelled as mornin. Finally I thought that the plot was interesting and it had twists and turns. \tThe weaknesses I found in the novel were that there wasn\u2019t too much plot about the football games, more about practices and the day of a game. In the novel there was not much game plot. Another weakness I found was the racism. I realized that people are still racist and it made me feel uncomfortable. The next weakness was that there wasn\u2019t a main protagonist. It was many peoples point of view and the book could have been better if it had a protagonist. Finally a weakness that came to my attention was the adjectives.\tEven though the novel Friday Night Lights had many weaknesses, it still was one of my favorite books. The strengths towered over the weaknesses and it was very enjoyable to read. I am looking forward to seeing the movie this weekend.

On the surface, it tells the story of the Permian Panthers, the high school football team from Permian High School in Odessa, Texas. It focuses on 6 of the senior players and some of the coaching staff. It gives us accounts of their backgrounds, families and their feelings about school, life and playing football. The season in question (1988) was supposed to be the year where the team were too good, they were meant to win the state championship. They had the players, they had the coach and they had the fans. Twenty thousand fans who queued a week early to get tickets for the local derby. The fans who took more interest in the high school football team than they did in the drop in oil price that was destroying the city. The fans who worried more about the form of their star running back than they did about the education of their children.The story is superbly written. The descriptions of the matches are visceral: you really can almost smell the blood, sweat and tears. This contrasts with the sections about foundation of the city and the background of the families and fans. To someone who played sport at school, I found the behaviour of the fans incredible. 20,000 people watched a SCHOOL match - unbelievableThe priorities in some of these schools seem completely crazy as well: More money spent of medical tape for the football team than was spent on the entire school English department; Teachers doctoring grades in order for players to pass and be eligible to play; Football players barely attending classes to concentrate on training. A shocking indictment of how the US school system was set up to favour the few.

I always read the forward of any book and this one, the author tells you up front he is looking for a sport to bash to be the next \"A Season on the Brink\" and Texas makes an easy target. The writer tells you he has an opinion of Texas before he heads south and writes the story based on his preconceived notions, not anything he actually saw in Texas. The writer finds negative stories about Texas history and writes like we are against educating our children. OK, public education isn't great in Texas but the same can be said for all 50 states. The writer prints people's responses to his questions as if they came up to him and just started talking. If you read this book, keep in mind it is local people answering a writer's questions after he said he was writing a story about their historic football program. No one knew it was a smear job until the book came out. The writer only covers athletes he can belittle in some way. For example, he barely mentions the biggest star on the team, Lloyd Hill. Hill only gets mentioned because he makes a big play in a big game. Lloyd Hill was a good kid, from a good family, and going to a big time college the writer never heard of, Texas Tech. But since Lloyd Hill was a good kid with nothing the writer could exploit and not going to a college non football fans knew, he wasn't worth writing about. The writer only focused on people he could mold into his preconceived notion of Texas being backwards and uneducated."}, {"userName": "Kirsti", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti", "userReview": "Affecting, amusing, alarming, appalling account of the winningest high-school football team in Texas.

There are hundreds of thousands of kids that play football in Texas but the small town of Odessa has some of the best players in the country on the Permian football squad. The Permian Panthers are just 52 men looking to be number one in the football world of Texas. H.G. Bissinger gives the reader a look into the life of a coach and his kids in a school rich with a winning history and the want to be great. Bissinger illustrates what it takes to be a student athlete and the struggles that go with it. Friday Night Lights is an insightful and thrilling book because of its emotionally moving story, with a flowing plot line, and stimulating characters.\tThe story line of Friday Night Lights is very emotionally gripping. Winchell, one of the main characters in the book, is putting everything he has into his final season of football. The fact that it\u2019s his last season is what makes this emotional. All the seniors mentioned are pushing everyone on the team to great lengths to make sure that they get to the State Championship for their last season in the program. Also the back stories of the players make the reader feel connected to them, especially Mike Winchell, Bissinger brings out his emotions more than a lot of other peoples in the book. In the State Championship he especially makes all that emotion come to life. The feeling of defeat and turmoil really sets in after reading that final chapter. There are also the happy feelings, like when they dominate an opponent and that\u2019s what makes this book very good, it grabs the mind and helps it feel connected. This novel is also fantastic in the way it flows and doesn\u2019t lose its place and get off topic.\tBissinger has a talent of not getting lost and going on random rants during the book. This makes the book easy to read and follow. During the course of the book it changes characters a lot, but it never moves its place in the season. No matter what player\u2019s point of view it is in, it\u2019s during the same game, or even the same preparation day during the week. A good example is when the team is nearing the state championship, Bissinger keeps all the thoughts that he mentions in one specific spot of the journey. This keeps the book thought provoking and the need to read more. This keeps the book moving, it makes it flow really well. This is what makes Friday Night Lights a must read, it doesn\u2019t get lost, and very few novels do that. The characters help the story move and flow very easily, but they are also very interesting and relatable.\tIn many books characters can make or break a book and in Friday Night Lights they make it. All the characters are relatable and make them life-like in a sense. On a personal level Winchell was the one Bissinger tried to really bring out and make him seem like a real person, not a super hero that most books have. Bissinger makes him human and puts Mike through the trials and stipulations of a real Division 1 high school quarterback. Failure and success is what makes all of them relatable in some way, because after a loss or a win they either are devastated or overjoyed which is what you can expect from any kid in a sport. Bissinger did a wonderful job explaining the characters lives so there is nothing left to tell, which as a reader helped immensely to relate to them, and truly understand who they are. A lot of the time Bissinger would take whole chapters of the book to describe the character he was about to introduce and give an integral role to in the book. For example the chapter he wrote about Ivory Christian, he took a chunk of the book to describe him as a person and understand him more so there were no questions asked as to who he is. This book as whole is very good but the characters are what mold it and make it great.\tThe flow to the plot line, with the emotional story and characters really make Friday Night Lights a must read. There are very few books that connect the reader to the story and make it come alive and feel real. If everyone followed the lessons that Bissinger preached about in his book, everyone would have a better understanding of how to deal with adversity and all the different challenges in life. This book gives a great sense to how much of a family everyone really becomes when they play a sport like football and this could help kids all around the world feel connected and be a part of something beyond their imagination."}, {"userName": "Katelyn Loehrke", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46815495-katelyn-loehrke", "userReview": "Personal Response:Friday Night Lights was not one of my favorite books, and it was hard to read through at times because it became very boring. There where parts of the book that I liked, and parts that I necessarily didn't like. I constantly was comparing this book to my life. My hometown to Odessa is very similar in ways; they both have their struggles and the community members disagree very often with some political problems but always have a time were they come together. In both times, this time would be the Friday night football games, as well as any of the sports games depending on what season it is. I like how the author wrote this book, thoroughly explaining throughout the whole book the problems in Odessa and described them how they are: truthfully and harsh. I would like to see the movie based off of this story.Plot Summary:In the book, the football team plays in a series of games. Some of those games are won, making the town proud, even though a few of those are not, which leads to a big dispute to fire the head coach or keep him to see if they can still win. As the games go on, the importance of them increases throughout the season. This occurs even more so, when not one-but two of the starting lineup players become injured and must sit out, one of those players may play again further down the season, even though the other is not as fortunate. The season comes closer and closer to state, and for the seniors on the team the pressure really picks up. Pressure not only from their coaches, their teammates, their entire community, and their family, but also from within themselves. To play for the Texas High School State Football Game their is a three way tie. Since only two can go on to play in the final game, something had to be done to choose which two they will be. A coin toss is what they did to determine this. So the head coaches, assistant coaches, and one of the best players from each of the three teams from the east and west side of Texas, met together at a small cafe. The name of the cafe could not be announced since the whole ordeal was recorded and televised lived on the local TV station as well as other stations across the state and they didn't want any people peering in all the windows being real loud and obnoxious. Each team brought their own coin, which was all different. The two teams with the same of one side, (heads or tails) would advance on to play in the state competition. The coins get flipped and they land on the floor. No one touches them, and they read them one by one. Thankfully Odessa's team the Permian Panthers, advance on after some wrong thoughts. Originally they thought that all three coins were landed on heads; under closer inspection, one of the coins which is kind of worn, turns out to actually have landed on tails. This then kicks the team out of the running for state winners. At the state competition it is a very close game the entire time, but with Permian always trailing. The very last play Permian has the ball in hand and all they have to do is travel less than ten yards to receive a touchdown and win the game. The clock is ticking down, down to 2 seconds when the ball is snapped, and the pressure is nothing like it is before on the quarterback. After the play is made, and all the calls finalized, Permian is less than half of a yard short of receiving the touchdown they needed. So, they lost. All of the Permian players are furious and upset, but they can't do anything to change it.Recommendation:I would recommend this book to anyone who know what the pressure of being the best player on a large team feels like. I also think that this book should be read by people who are affected by racial differences in their community, because this books describes both points of view. I gave this book a rating of three out of five stars because it was a good book, for the point that the author was trying to bring across and show to the readers about the real world. Overall I enjoyed reading this and can not wait to watch the movie."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/991678-michael", "userReview": "\"Friday Night Lights: A Town, A Team, and A Dream\"By H.G. BissingerBefore I knew of the book, I knew of the TV show, which itself grew out of the film adaptation. And I knew it was about high school football in the heart of Texas where football and religion were one and the same. I don't count myself as a fan of sports movies but I do watch them from time to time, but you won't find me actively searching for one. So it went with \"Friday Night Lights\". The film adaption came and went in theaters and I thought nothing of it. The same went for its DVD release. And pretty much the same thing happened for the first season of the TV series. But slowly I started to hear things about the franchise, especially the TV series. One of the things I heard was that the TV series expanded on the themes and ideals that were explored in both the film and the book. And before I knew it, within a month's span, I picked up the first season of the TV series, the DVD of the film, and with luck on my side I found a copy of the book at the bargain bin center of the bookstore. I watched the film and the plight of the Permian Panther's bid for the 1988 Texas State Championships and for a brief moment realized the intensity that came with the game. But two hours was just not enough. I wanted more. So I went to the TV series and devoured it up. It touched on many things that movie danced around and by the time I finished the season, I decided I had to read the original source material that started it all.It's the middle of March now and I remember starting the book at the start the year. I had watched the movie back around November and I wasn't sure if I would remember the characters but sure enough I soon did. Before long, names such as Boobie Miles, Mike Winchell, Billingsley, Chavez, and Coach Gary Gaines lived in my mind as I read the book. Though I knew of what was going to come because of the movie, what I didn't account for was the wealth of information that H.G. Bissinger had incorporated in the book. There were histories towns, people, racism, and the Permian Panthers themselves. This book was not simply about football in West Texas but it is rather a bigger picture at a slice of life in this section of America. In some ways Texas is a microcosm of the nation. Both Texas and the nation went from boom to bust in the Eighties during the time of 'big oil'. Racism was as much as a hotly debated topic of concern as it is for the nation. Football itself for the area has strong ties to racism and town histories and state championships. But it's the concentrated concern of the high school football athletes that's always front and center. Just as most of the world seems concentrated at the years of high school and college, it is this sentiment seen at its height and ugliness with high school football. Boys have been brought up with the desire to play football and go all the way. Just like ancient gladiators or Spartans or Romans, do they fight with all their might on the field. The towns cheer for them. The towns cheat for them. The towns fight for them. The towns live through them. And all this comes to a head on a single day, on a single night: Friday nights.- Michael Midnight"}, {"userName": "Makayla Osterberg", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39129806-makayla-osterberg", "userReview": "Growing up a football watcher and managing our local high school football team, it is no surprise that I enjoyed H.G. Bissinger\u2019s book Friday Night Lights.\tBissinger does a great job of painting a picture while you\u2019re reading and letting you get to know the characters. You can imagine yourself with the six senior starters and part of the coaching staff in the run-down town, at the games, and attending practice while dying of the Texas heat and drinking the unsanitary water. Making you want to read more to find out about the next game, football is just a small portion of what is discussed in this novel. The book also focuses on the small Texas town of Odessa that is almost to the point of no existence. The only thing to keep it going is that the high school football team, the Permian Panthers, are the winningest football team in Texas history. It is a program that everyone wants to be a part of. \tThe town of Odessa was falling apart but that is not what the school and fans were concerned about. The priorities at the school were not that of a normal school. More money was spent on medical tape then the entire english department and teachers were changing students grades just to be sure they were passing. The players would stop attending class to get more training time and parents were less worried about their childs education, and more about how the team was going to preform. \tAlthough the team is good, it is not the strongest or the biggest. They start the season off looking great, but in the pre-season the star running back has to go out with a serious knee injury. They started losing and their biggest game was coming up. If they won, they would go to playoffs, but if they lost they would go into a three way tie coin toss. Come game time, the star player thought he was ready to go in, but when he did he got hit hard making his knee injury even worse. With the running back being out again, the Panthers ended up losing and going to the coin toss. They won the coin toss and were sent to the playoffs. In the playoffs, they had to go up against the Dallas Carter Cowboys. Not knowing what to do without the star player, they had to find new strengths in each player to try to beat this team. In the last play of the game, the Panthers quarter back, Mike Winchell, threw an incomplete pass and Permian lost 14-9. \tI think this book is great because it teaches you to never give up on any of your hopes and dreams. It also teaches you to keep going no matter what kind of situation you are in.

make it clear that Odessa is NOT a small town. It may be small compared to Philly, but in Texas, it is not small. Denver City, where I grew up has a population of less than 4,000. That is small!I read this after reading Mitch Cullin's brilliant \"Whompyjawed.\" Big mistake. Although Cullin's book is fiction, it captures the atmosphere of small town football so much better than this. I'm not saying that Bissinger's book isn't good--it's a fine read. It's just if you really want to know just how crazy small town West Texas people are about football, read Cullin."}, {"userName": "Joe Mccahon", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8486327-joe-mccahon", "userReview": "#4  The first third of the novel is the background of the little town in Texas called Odessa. In this little town, it may not have big corporations or a booming economy, but I does have one thing, high school football. The local high school team, the Panthers, has a great tradition of succeeding in football. To the players on the team and even the locals of Odessa, their \"American Dream\" is to win state. As one of the largest states in the US, Texas is also one of the best at football. That tall challenge is exactly what the town longs for.  However, unlike other books we read, the struggles to achieve their dream is not through one individual. It is not even through one team. The entire town as a whole longs for their dream to be fulfilled. No matter how work is going or how bad things are at home, football is their relief from the hardships of life. All year the town as a whole looks forward to those friday nights in fall to see their Panthers win. And thats exactly what they plan on doing. In the first third of the book it is only preseason, but the team, like any individual in the books we read, has set a goal to win state. They plan on doing everything in their power to achieve that goal.#3 Going along with what we are learning in class about the movements Martin Luther King Jr. started and such, this book gives more understanding of the struggles of African Americans in society. The second third of the book talks more about the racism and discrimination in society. I like to think that I understand that racism is barely evident in our society; however, even though MLK helped break down many barriers between whites and blacks, some still exist. This book has enlightened me that racism, even though not as bad as the beginning of the 19th century, is still happening.  It came to me as somewhat of a shock and even an embarrassment that things like racism still occurred up to the late 1980s and possibly even today. This book has given me a greater understanding and knowledge that racism is very evident in modern society, especially in the south. The southern culture, along with many older generations in the south, believe strongly that white people are better than everyone else. It is quite sad that in almost the 90s this was still happening. Fortunately for the town of Odessa, on the football field it doesn't matter your still color; football is all that matters."}], "description": "Friday Night Lights", "title": "Friday Night Lights : A Town, a Team and a Dream", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/927593.Friday_Night_Lights_", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356459350l/927593.jpg", "reviews": 2077, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/449547.H_G_Bissinger", "name": "H.G.
