I found myself setting aside the book several times early on in my attempts to read it because I had other things on my mind and realized I was doing it an injustice by skimming so much \u2013 because at least in the early parts of Alexandra\u2019s journey to and arrival in Spain, skimming the potentially optional descriptive passages meant skimming massive sections of the book. So I realized I either had to wait for a time when I was in the mood to slow down and see whether I genuinely enjoyed them, or just give up on the book because not enough was going to happen to capture my interest.Finally on a slow night I gave it a third try, and was glad that I did. I ended up finding Fielding's crafting of the environment to be a lot more effective than in a typical romantic sort of book \u2013 it came across unquestionably as well-researched as the best historical fiction, with a nice eye for unique details, especially since the setting is an uncommon one to begin with. (Sometimes with Regencies, you feel like the only research the author did was reading 5 other Regencies; but given the relatively low number of stories I've seen set in post-War Spain, it seems like Fielding did her own research and drew from unique experiences, and I really dig that.)There are at least a dozen interesting locations for scenes in the book -- many of them completely unexpected, like the buildings where a wealthy industrial family crafts and stores sherry -- the main building of which was a seventeenth century convent. I have no idea to what extent Fielding is basing her locations around real places and to what extent she is drawing on her travels for the basic elements of climate, geography, and architecture, but then using her imagination and recombining elements and creating details that make her settings so compelling and vivid. But Fielding even knows the Spanish name for the ladle used to taste sherry directly from barrels (and that it's made from whalebone). She'll talk for a couple of pages about fermentation and blending, and of course, taste. It's slow, sophisticated writing that assumes you have an attention span and an interest in detail. But then...The romance and characters\u2026 At times I felt like the romance has all the emotional subtlety and nuance of an episode of America's Next Top Model. Clich\u00e9s abounded, and I often marveled, trying to remember the last time I read a book where setting and environment were by so far the best aspects\u2026 It\u2019s not just that the love interest is a broody, tall, dark, handsome man. It\u2019s all the little things about how Alexandra feels about him: the fluttering and nerves and blushing\u2026 He has Issues! He sends mixed messages! Sometimes they kiss and she melts! Sometimes he ignores her and she acts like a high school girl trying to make him jealous! (And sometimes [yes I said sometimes, plural] almost gets herself raped by a freaky sadist with a dining room [yes, I said dining room] full of torture devices!)Other characters also fall into extremely broad archetypes \u2013 the sullen, bitter younger stepsister; the loathsome estate manager; the old dowager who most people think is intractable and irascible, but who might be something of a fairy godmother to our intrepid, pure-hearted heroine; not to mention the gypsies who are so classically Gypsy that they belong more in a magical realist novel than a realistic one. It\u2019s an odd mix, to combine Fielding\u2019s lengthy, detailed, occasionally very sensitive and well-researched descriptions with such rudimentary character construction. And because most of the book is so realistic, you can't let her off the hook for writing one-dimensional fairy-tale style characters. One scene in particular where this oddity came to a head was around the midpoint of the novel when Alexandra attends a bullfight... and the matador spontaneously dedicates the fight to her by throwing her his hat. There are all kinds of details about the trip to the bullfight and the fight itself that clearly reflect a love and knowledge of both the country and the traditions; yet suddenly in the midst of that realism (and brutality), the most famous matador in Spain supposedly singles out our charming heroine from an entire stadium of people and throws his hat to her because she is that damn hot? (Oh, and just in case you don't realize what a big deal this is, Ramon whispers, \"He's offered you his life as a gift. It's the greatest homage a bullfighter can pay a woman, and Don Felipe doesn't hand out his attentions lightly. Usually he dedicates his fight to the whole arena.\") (Oh, and also by the way, this takes place less than 24 hours after Alexandra almost dies in a car that is run off the road and nearly falls off a mountain cllff and has to be rescued by tall, dark, handsome Salvador. So... she's a busy girl. As well as the hottest thing in the history of hotness, apparently. ) I'm sure there are legions of fans of romantic novels who don't care how outlandish an event is -- if it's ROMANTIC, then bring it on. But I belong to a subset that isn't as interested in such over-the-top theatrics and fantasy. I'd rather read a book I can actually picture myself in, where the guy involved would have some chance of liking a reasonably cute girl who possesses conversational skills and some talent, and it's okay if it takes a little while for him to figure it out. (Mr. Darcy, for example, would actually <3 me back. This is a fact.)I think I can encapsulate my discomfiture with this novel most succinctly by referring to the issue of tone and expectations. Early on in the novel Alexandra meets a mysterious gypsy fortune teller who absolutely MUST read her fortune and acts all dire and scary about what she is about to reveal. Like fictional gypsy fortune tellers do. Said fortune teller tells Alexandra that she has two paths before her -- one for an easy, contented life... and one for a journey that will be (paraphrasing here ) long and arduous and complicated, rife with suffering, but with the ultimate reward of epic love. I dunno... somehow Fielding made me think I was going to be reading an epic work in the nature of Gone With the Wind. Or even Jane Eyre. But... though Alexandra takes the long path rife with all the stuff (duh), somehow the stuff never quite gets to the level of Stuff, if you see what I mean. She is saved not once but twice from being raped by the sadistic rapist with the torture dining room, and the first time she honestly doesn't even seem to KNOW it. The second time she kinda realizes something bad could have happened, but the rapist's godmother gives her some tea and soothes her and... eh, life goes on. The evil estate overseer HATES Alexandra.... and just kinda ends up getting taken out of the picture by the gypsies without ever getting to make his animosity a problem for Alexandra. Salvador's gypsy lover HATES Alexandra and wants to make her life miserable... but never does much more than shoot her dirty looks. (They get in a fight once, but Alexandra gives as good as she gets.) Alexandra's half sister HATES her and would love to ruin her... but doesn't do much more about it than make the occasional bitchy remark. Someone tries to scare Alexandra by shooting an arrow at her... and sure, it scares her for about 20 minutes. But it doesn't kill her and it doesn't scare her off, and I don't think she much cares about it a few pages later. There are so many people in this book who hate Alexandra -- way more than hate Scarlet O'Hara in her book -- but aside from being depressed/angsty over mixed messages from Salvador and spending a lot of time sad because she's not with him, I'm not sure Alexandra ever reaches a level of particularly interesting or complex suffering. ...And the ending. [Spoilers follow, I suppose, if you didn't know that Alexandra and Salvador will be sitting in a tree and k-i-s-s-i-n-g] It's happy, of course. But I really feel like it's one of those \"comes out of nowhere\" endings. Alexandra's been in England grieving over Salvador for over a year. She thinks he married someone else. She lost the love of her life. She has to move on. It's hard. Then... he shows up! And tells her he loved her all along! As a great believer in the Frabjous Day, I can't help but feel that one actually has to be witness to or participate in the slaying of the Jabberwock to... earn it, as it were. Alexandra mostly just sat around and waited and brooded (when she wasn't being immature and playing games to try to make Salvador jealous) and then suddenly... FRABJOUSNESS! Not buying it, Senator.Fielding also has a tendency as a writer that I don't much care for -- to recap. A lot. Take a random chapter (like 9, for example). Fielding begins it with pages and pages of recap. Salvador's character. His troubles. Alex's lusties for him and her tormenting, unrequited(?) luuuuuuuuv. Now, believe me, I realize that when you're falling in love and circumstances are difficult and the guy is all enigmatic and infuriating and sends mixed messages, you recap internally. A lot. (Especially when you're 16.) But at some point an accurate depiction of a person's internal wheel spinning turns into novel writing that isn't the most thrilling to read. For me, a generally self-indulgent dreamer, to be thinking \"Okay, get on with the stuff happening...\" means you're probably recapping too much. The rest of chapter 9 follows the same pattern as preceding chapters: Alexandra and Salvador have a nice interaction... then a romantic moment, then he pulls back, she tries to turn him on or make him jealous, he shuts her down... and then Chapter 10 begins. With a recap of her thoughts and feelings! Which are exactly the same as they were during Chapter 9's recap!Fielding makes some extremely odd choices in her narrative on occasion -- for example, she's mostly going on in simple past tense, but then will inexplicably and unnecessarily shift something into the past perfect -- including a major event that would have made much more sense to tell as part of a continuous, linear narrative. An example that really hit me over the head: instead of showing you as directly as possible when one character (avoiding spoilers) proposes to Alexandra, all we know in the preceding narrative is that they've been in the same place for a while, spending time together -- time which is accounted for in a linear, basic way. Then she skips a couple of hours ahead in time, and suddenly you learn how he \"had proposed...Alexandra had been at a loss for words... Alexandra had protested... he'd whispered.\" Might seem picky, but I don't understand how you can spend pages and pages talking about making sherry and then try to minimize the significance of a proposal by giving it just under three pages, shifted strangely out of focus and time by that tense change.Also, perhaps a small picky point... but nevertheless as it is my final thought while reading the final pages of this book, I will share it with you: please, please, please, whoever you are out there -- novelist, scholar, young, old, amateur or master in the ways of love -- don't ever use the word \"umpteenth\" in a sentence that is suppose to be erotic. (Unless of course you are one of my dear GR friends and want to take up the challenge in the comments section for the fun of it....)**Those troublemakers at Net Galley offered me a complimentary copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review. Hope you enjoy! (And hey, if you like slower-paced, sort of self-indulgent romance novels that focus a lot on locations and the fantasy of being in another life, in another time, give this one a try. I just don't recommend it so enthusiastically if your priorities are character and dialogue.)"}, {"userName": "Snooty1", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56024443-snooty1", "userReview": "To burn with desire and keep quiet about it is the greatest punishment we can bring ourselves-Federico Garcia Lorca This review is a tough one, because I really liked the book...it was just soooooo long.

I was immediately taken in by the cover of the book but as soon as I read the description on the back, I was keen to get started!Spring, 1950. Alexandra de Falla, a half-English, half-Spanish young writer abandons her privileged but suffocating life in London and travels to Spain to be reunited with her long-estranged family. Instead of providing the sense of belonging she yearns for, the de Fallas are driven by seething emotions, and in the grip of the wild customs and traditions of Andalucia, all of which are alien to Alexandra. Among the strange characters and sultry heat of this country, she meets the man who awakens emotions she hardly knew existed. But their path is strewn with obstacles: dangerous rivals, unpredictable events, and inevitable indiscretions. What does Alexandra\u2019s destiny hold for her in this flamboyant land of drama and all-consuming passions, where blood is ritually poured on to the sands of sun-drenched bullfighting arenas, mysterious gypsies are embroiled in magic and revenge, and beautiful dark-eyed dancers hide their secrets behind elegant lacy fans?I REALLY enjoyed this book from Hannah Fielding. I liked Alexandra straight away, as a character she is very likeable, I related to her personality and I really felt a connection with her. I think I connected with Alexandra because like me, she is experiencing Spain and everything involved in her move there for the first time, and so I felt as though I was learning alongside her. The customs were truly fascinating \u2013 the dances, the gypsies, the bull-fighting, and the flamboyance and drama too\u2026I was absolutely hooked to what I was reading and could not put it down! I did feel for Alexandra, I knew that this all was completely new too her and so another reason I was glued to the pages was because I desperately wanted to know how things would work out for her, both with this new lifestyle and traditions, and definitely how things would work out with Salvador! I was SO intrigued by Salvador, and Hannah\u2019s writing is so good that I could feel the connection and sparks between Alexandra and Salvador radiating from the pages! Wow.One thing that I love about Hannah\u2019s novels in particular is her settings and how she always brings them to life. In this case it was 1950\u2019s and Spain, and let me just say\u2026wow! Hannah\u2019s writing is so descriptive and flows so beautifully that you can\u2019t help but be completely lost in her words and transported to wherever it is she is writing about. I have very little knowledge of Spain but Hannah;s words brought everything to life and created very vivid scenes for me, and it genuinely felt as though I had been transported there and was standing next to Alexandra watching every scene unfold in front of me. I could feel the hot temperature of Spain, I really sensed the atmosphere amongst Alexandra and the people she was with, and I was completely taken in by dancers, gypsies, masked balls\u2026the beauty and glamour of it all and of everything else that was happening. I liked that this story was not an easy story, there is danger and tension within the pages and at times my heart raced when I was reading because I had no clue where Hannah would take me next!Indiscretion is a powerful story that really captures you and pulls you in. Full of passion, danger, love and a fantastic setting, Indiscretion is a stunning story that is truly consuming and gripping \u2013 you won\u2019t want to be parted from it!"}, {"userName": "Sofia T.

Thank you so much, Ms Fielding, for giving me this opportunity]Can I be considered a Spaniard now that I've finished the Andalucian Nights series? I\u00a0need\u00a0to thank Ms Fielding for introducing me to:Proper historical fiction; I never imagined that I'd ever be capable of reading Historical novels. I'm so grateful for this series. I loved each and every book to pieces. The characters are so precious and each one of them holds a special place in my heart.SPAIN. Okay, I had this insane obsession with everything\u00a0Spanish\u00a0back in the day. But this is different on so many levels. I mean, I ACTUALLY KNOW SOME SPANISH NOW. It's not much, but I genuinely know a couple of words, legends,\u00a0proverbs, some Arabic ones at that! So, yes, saying that I spent the whole time fangirling over the most typical things in this series would be the understatement of the century.What I noticed is that although the three books in the series took place in Spain, I did not find any repetition with the descriptions of scenery and landscape. And let's make one thing clear. I have never tolerated long paragraphs of scenery descriptions due to them boring me out of my mind, but Ms Fielding quite literally makes the scenery come alive. I'd read a whole book of her describing Spain's landmarks and landscapes and I wouldn't complain one bit.\u00a0Now, let's talk about Indiscretion.I knew I was going to like this book from the very first chapter. We were introduced to Alexandra, a half-Spanish half-English writer who lives in England with her aunt. When her father pays her a visit after 15 years and asks her to come back to Spain with him to meet her family, she decides to go ahead and do just that.\u00a0Meeting her aristocratic family was the funniest and most entertaining scene I've read. The grumpy stepmother, the spoiled stepsister, the sweet and amusing cousin, and the incredibly charming and mysterious 2nd cousin with a tortured past. Like, seriously, one cannot walk away from a book with such alive and interesting characters.\u00a0This is a coming-of-age story. A woman trying to find her roots, and stumbling across love on her journey.\u00a0Ramon is my spirit animal. That guy is incredibly underrated. The novel would have never made it without him, I can say that with one hundred percent certainty.\u00a0What made this book my favorite one yet is that scene with Alexandra and Salvador, where she's hell-bent on proving to him that \"she doesn't need the protection Spanish women seem to accept without question\". Yes, she was struggling, trying to make sense of those Spanish customs, which she doesn't find quite logical. That banter was honestly my favorite part of the novel. I can relate a lot to what she was going through, as I, myself, am trying make sense of those very same customs that are still present in my society.But the best part was the compromise the couple seemed to have reached at the end of the book. To swallow your pride for the sake of being with the one you love only to find that they've done the very same thing. To apologize and get an apology in return? It was all very overwhelming and absolutely incredible."}, {"userName": "Georgia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13555902-georgia", "userReview": "Find more in Chill and readAlexandra de Falla is a half-English half-Spanish young woman who was raised by her Aunt Geraldine in England, when her parents were separated and her mother was lost.

The de Fallas are riven with seething emotions, full of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts.

Even so, she founds affection in the person she never thought she would. Her grandmother, the duquesa, Dona Maria Dolores, was the one that never accepted her mother and that made Alexandra feel distant to her, while the two of them were living so far away from each other. On the contrary, once they are close, they make a strong family bond and Alexandra feels safe around the duquesa.Apart from a loving grandmother and a mischievous family, the young woman finds love in the face of a tall, handsome, masculine and honorable spaniard, Salvador. Salvador is heading the family business along with the duquesa, even though he is not a relative by blood, but an adopted one. However, he fully supports the family interests and honors his heritage. Alexandra falls from him from the first time she lays eyes on him and she is surprised by her own feelings.This is a story of love and affection and finding one\u2019s true identity.

She tells tales and legends of Spain and the Spaniard way of living. The rules that have to be followed, the climate of the post war Spain, the traditions that prevail over logic, and so on.The beautiful descriptions of the surroundings transfer the reader right in the heart of Andalucia. It is a fact that she can really transfer all the beauty of that marvelous region into paper and vividly create the wonderful setting behind the reader\u2019s eyes.

Some readers may not like this.What I didn\u2019t care for: The main character. Gosh, she\u2019s annoying. Listen up, ladies. If a man keeps changing his mind every chapter and oscillates between hot and cold faster than my wonky showerhead, you need to dump his sorry ass.Here\u2019s how every chapter in this book goes: Alexandra and Salvador have a moment. Alexandra happy. \ud83d\ude42 Salvador changes his mind and walks away. Alex sad. \ud83d\ude26Seriously, girl? Don\u2019t you learn?Oh, and while itty-bitty baby Alexandra mopes about everything through the entirety of this novel, I can\u2019t help but wonder why she thinks she has it bad. She doesn\u2019t. Here are a few examples of exactly how every difficulty Alexandra faces is quickly extinguished (by the author\u2019s God complex?):1. Her car hangs off a cliff after an accident. She safely jumps into our boi Salvador\u2019s arms.2. An arrow nearly misses her one day. The perpetrator is revealed a few chapters later, but nothing really happens to her again.3. The steward in the de Falla estate hates her. The steward is successfully eliminated from Alexandra\u2019s big list of emotional boo-boos after a run in with the gypsies.There\u2019s a lot more that can be added to this list, but I\u2019m leaving them out so as to not spoil the story. But, why do I still think it\u2019s a good read? It\u2019s fast-paced. You can read it really fast despite it being a tome.This is a good book despite its main character being a whiner. You should definitely check it out if you like romance, Spain, and/or hugely descriptive writing."}, {"userName": "Katrina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14392517-katrina", "userReview": "With Hannah Fielding\u2019s latest novel, she has pulled it off again. I was waiting for her next book and wasn\u2019t disappointed. This time, she takes us to Spain in 1950, and I could almost feel the heat of the Spanish sun on my face and hear the sound of flamenco guitars as I was reading. The writing here is just as atmospheric as her previous book, The Echoes of Love, and I loved Indiscretion even more because of the magic she weaves in bringing this vision of Spain alive: the wild and colourful gypsies, and the intrigue surrounding them and the de Falla family, not to mention the exciting aspect of Spanish bullfighting. I found the sinister rival, Felipe, chilling and fascinating at the same time, and a great addition to the story, contrasting nicely with our hero, Salvador (deliciously brooding), and highlighting Alexandra\u2019s fallible character as she fights to retain her sparky independence in the face of such a reactionary and traditional society. 1950s Andalucia was still living in a bygone age in some respects, not just because of things like an antiquated railway system and the fact that people still used horse and carts as much as cars, but because deeply Catholic Spain was still so very conservative towards women, something that the author conveys very well, in addition to depicting its religious piety. This was a time and place where a young senorita behaved in a certain way and certainly didn\u2019t go out without a chaperone, something which gives our heroine plenty to rebel against \u2013 and which gets her into hot water. The pace of the story was as cracking as an Andalucian horse whip, and kept me turning the pages avidly to see how Alexandra was going to extricate herself from both her suffocating Spanish family and the menacing warnings all around her (including Salvador\u2019s) \u2026and in turn how Salvador was going to untangle himself from his own web of mistakes and misfortunes to end up with the lovely Alexandra.What I also liked were the contrasts between Spain and England at the beginning and end of the story, and how that felt to Alexandra, brought up in a privileged but stifling upper-class environment. The small but telling details about London in that era brought it to life even more (I loved the atmospheric and nostalgic descriptions of Chelsea), giving it a glamorous, escapist feel while remaining realistic (the fact that the well-heeled still had butlers at that time, despite the post-war economic pinch, though even they were still subject to rationing). This is wonderful, good old-fashioned romance the way it\u2019s meant to be, with tension, drama, a brooding, irresistible hero and a gorgeous heroine battling against the odds in a world steeped in romance, moonlight, gypsies, flamenco and the heat of the Spanish sun.

She's twenty-five and though she writes about love, she's yet to experience it herself. Her Spanish family is...strange...to the say the least. They are wealthy; they tolerate a wild group of Gypsies on their land; and all the women are terrible bitches, it seems, except Esmeralda, who is just a coward.And Alexandra is just thrown into the middle of all their drama--the drama pretty much surrounding the incredibly good looking Salvador who is just oh so seductive...and crazy. He's got a secret baby, a fiance, and yet lusts after his cousin one min and tells her to go home five min later. That's pretty much the first 40%.I wanted to like this book. I normally really enjoy the Spanish setting and the heroine is very independent. But I didn't like it. I abandoned at the halfway point, as the most exciting thing at that point was that someone shot an arrow at the heroine. I was actually cheering that something besides Salvador drama and lust was going on.Things that put me off:--It does NOT feel like 1950. Not even close. The novel mentions how backward Spain is and that they are still recovering from war, but it felt like Victorian days, even the way they dress. And while the Spanish may be stuck in the past, for Alexandra, a British lass, to be that way...in 1950??? No.--The hero is a bipolar and runs hot then cold, hot then cold, and frankly, treats the heroine like crap. Her pining for this guy did her no favors with me.--It's predictable. The costume, the man on the pier...I saw it all coming from the very first.--The hero again...is obviously a man whore and Alexandra is this virginal angel...I hate that.--Did I mention all the women are bitches? The grandmother, the gypsy, the stepmother, the stepsister, the Isabel lady. Everyone but the heroine and the maid Agusta pretty much.--After all the cold reception, why didn't Alexandra just go home? What's keeping her in Spain?

Set in the fifties, this is a story about a colorful, passionate and traditional culture and a woman who in the middle of it all, has to discover herself and love.This romance is about more than love, it\u2019s about the choices we make to be the person we want. The characters have to discover what they really want and how far they are willing to go if happiness is the prize. It deals with the conflict that comes when different cultures collide and how destiny can be tricky at times.The story has a fast rhythm and despite its length (the paperback has more than 400 pages) the words flow by quickly and the story drags you into its deepness and it\u2019s hard to let go. The richness of the writing makes it even better.Alexandra is a nice character because she has a real personality and becomes a tridimensional character. Her flaws and strengths make her sound even more real and you can understand her doubts and actions. Salvador is a mysterious character at first but once the story unravels, we discover a man driven by the sense of duty, loyalty and honesty above all. He is a powerful man, handsome and hard not to love. All of him is consuming not only for Alexandra but for the readers as well.The author managed to capture the passion and intensity of the Spanish people. As a Spanish descendent I can assure you everything she says about them is true. Her words consume your soul and take you to a place where emotions are skin deep and it\u2019s easy to get lost in the feelings and the story.I have to talk about the sexual tension and the constant latent passion. This is not an erotic book but the physical attraction between the characters is a major ingredient of the story. It was overwhelming for moments and if it\u2019s was hard for them to live with it, imagine how hard is for the reader that is waiting to know what comes next.Overall, Indiscretion is an excellent romance book and I\u2019m looking forward to read the next book.*** I received a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review. ***"}, {"userName": "Alexandra Borthwick", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10878011-alexandra-borthwick", "userReview": "Un-put-downable romance just like they used to make Indiscretion is the third Hannah Fielding book which I have read and I must say it does not disappoint. It has all the hallmarks of the author\u2019s style: vivid, transporting descriptions, magical locations, danger and intrigue and of course unbridled and unashamed romance. I can honestly say that I picked it up and wasn\u2019t able to put it down until I had finished the last page - and then I was tempted to start it all over again! The story is written from the perspective of Alexandra de Falla, a beautiful, half-Spanish, half-English writer who, having grown up in England, returns to her estranged family in Spain to explore her roots and have an adventure. The reception she receives from her extended family on arrival is mixed and we are at once plunged into the shady throes of individual secrets, passions and ambitions. Against the backdrop of their magnificent ancestral home, El Pavon, Alexandra begins to discover her true identity and for the first time experiences what it is to fall deeply and madly in love. Salvador - her (and our!) hero - is everything you could ask for in a man: kind and compassionate, handsome and commanding, yet behind his clear blue eyes lie shadows and secrets which threaten to keep them apart forever. \u2018Indiscretion\u2019 it seems is Alexandra\u2019s enemy and the book allows us to share her tumultuous journey, encountering gyspy rituals, dashing toreadors and the dazzling sights, sounds and smells of Spain along the way. Hannah Fielding\u2019s passion and knowledge of Spain and Spanish culture lends the novel an air of authenticity and she writes with an excitement for her subject and characters which is infectious. With all it\u2019s twists and turns, Indiscretion is possibly my favourite of her novels so far and I\u2019m delighted that the next instalment in the de Falla saga - Masquerade - can take me back to El Pavon this weekend!"}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143983-louise", "userReview": "ISBN: 978-0-9926-7188-4INDISCRETION is an intense read. From the Spanish landscape to the homes, to the people to the relationships, to the entertainment of the bull fighting ring. The passion between Salvador and Alexandra runs deep. Although she couldn't understand his intermittent aloofness towards her, she loved him unconditionally. Salvador would go from talking to her, being passionate toward her to totally ignoring her and not even acknowledging her presence at times. Alexandra leaves her home in London during the Spring of 1950 to reunite with the family she's been estranged from for a long time. What she finds in Spain is not at all what she expected and she finds herself wondering if she's made a mistake by going there. Her only redemption in her visit there is, Salvador whom she falls madly in love with. The love and deep passion between the two of them is like one heartbeat.I kept finding myself wanting to rush them into their relationship, wanting to push them to the point of no return but it was not to be, I had to be patient. Their love story took my breath away and left me reeling and wanting more. I so didn't want this story to end. I thought Ms. Fielding had outdone herself with her second novel but she's done it again with this third one. The writing was so clear and descriptive that I could hear the crowds in the bull fighting ring, I could feel the dust in my nose and eyes and feel the scorching Spanish sun on my skin. I loved the gypsies, one of whom actually scared me! Indiscretion is filled with passion, intrigue, suspense, and a deep intensity that you'll want to read it again.

The story itself was breath taking and I felt like I can been transported to Spain, in the 50's by the use of the author's outstanding writing style. Fielding certainly has a talent for storytelling and it is a rare jewel that I was more than happy to discover within the pages of this book. Just on the writing style alone I would suggest reading this book however there is much more to this book that is to be devoured.I will start with the plot. It drew me from page one. I knew I was going to like this book, but I didn't know how much I would love it by the time that I finished reading the pages. The plot is bold, daring and romantic all into one. I have never read a book like this before and so I am still excited about the story even now that I have finished my reading and have started to write this review.The romance in this book was slightly different than typical romances. I think this book is more of an adventure read for me more than a romance, but the romance certainly highlighted the novel and was an added bonus for me. So another great job on Fielding's part to have written romance into this book.As for Alexandria I related well to her character. I enjoyed her personality and company. I rooted for her as I could not get enough of her story.Before Indiscretion I haven't read a book by Fielding and I don't understand how I have overlooked this amazing writer.

I read Fielding's novel The Echoes of Love about a month ago, and unfortunately I didn't enjoy it. As a result, I was hesitant to start Indiscretion. But I'm happy to say that it was a lot better than TEOL, even if I still didn't love it.It was a relaxing read, and it was easy to get lost in the exotic world Fielding created. The atmosphere was fully immersed in the story, and the setting was a character in itself. But to be honest, the description - which was exquisitely detailed and frequently vivid, though not as much as you would expect - was both a positive and a negative. Yes, it's vivid, and Fielding does a brilliant job of evoking all the senses and showcasing every possible detail in the scene, but the problem lies in that very fact: it leaves nothing to the imagination. And because there's so much detail, it's impossible to take it all in. I didn't find the huge amount of description boring, exactly, but there was just too much to absorb, and at the end of the scene I'd come away without having seen the setting and characters clearly in my mind. Or at least, without the level of detail Fielding had invested in it. The plot was incredibly threadbare, and had all the cliches of a stereotypical romance: dashing hero - dark and brooding - innocent heroine, equally dashing rival - but who, unlike the hero, goes just a bit too far over to the dark side. The language was cheesy and flowery, the dialogue unrealistic, and the passionate exchanges between Alexandra and Salvador made me roll my eyes. My favourite characters were Esmeralda and Ramon. I did like Alexandra's writing temperament, but I couldn't stand how perfect she was; and by perfect, I mean how beautiful she was. She had real flaws and I liked that, but I couldn't stand how literally every man in the novel was falling at her feet in adoration and begging her to marry him. She was beautiful - the author never missed the chance to remind me - and I just had no patience for a heroine that everyone seemed to be falling in love with and who put the looks of every other woman to shame. Salvador was not my kind of hero, but I can certainly see why female readers would swoon over him. Personally, I found him infuriatingly hot and cold (the way he treated Alexandra was aggravating, to say the least) and he had huge potential for becoming controlling, domineering, and overly possessive when it came to Alexandra. I didn't like the romance at all. Fielding's romances are always very physical, and I personally want more from a romance than that. The amount of lusting that went on between Alexandra and Salvador was tiresome and irritating, and I couldn't stand it. I wanted more relationship, and yet things were constantly coming back to the physical. I'm not denying physical attraction plays a part in romance - obviously it does - but in this novel it was the emphasis, and that didn't sit well with me. Here are some passages from the book that added to my dislike of the romance and Salvador: \"What about the night at Ronda, and this morning?\" she {Alexandra} whispered........\"They meant nothing.\" Salvador lent an arm on the cupboard door and ran the other hand through his unruly hair.\"Nothing?\" Alexandra stared in disbelief.\"Why must you always challenge me, Alexandra?\" He spoke without looking at her. \"You're a very beautiful woman. No hot-blooded man would be able to resist you. Can't you see that?\" WHAT? Excuse me? I have a huge problem with that conversation, and I feel like it summarises the characters' relationship: they'll spend a passionate minute or so making out in the shadows, and then Salvador will be all cold and distant to Alexandra and she'll have a little tantrum because she doesn't understand why he keeps pushing her away. Not to mention the fact that in this particular dialogue, he basically tells her that it's her fault he's attracted to her and unable to keep his hands off her, and it's all because she's just *insert sigh* too beautiful... URGH. Walk away, girl, walk away. And there's more: Salvador tells Alexandra when they're married: \"We Spanish men don't like to let our wives out of our sight. we suffer an innate feeling of insecurity which makes us possessive and jealous, and I......am no exception to the rule, as you've experienced.\" They both laughed and he drew her into his arms tenderly. You might think, by reading that last line, that he was joking. It's clear he isn't, though, as the rest of the story proves: Salvador is very jealous and possessive at times, and has said similar things to Alexandra throughout the course of the story.I still say: Walk away, girl, walk away. If you love heated, passionate romance amid radiant historical settings and bubbling with secrets and revenge, then I'm positive you'll love \nIndiscretion.\n For me, however, the cons stood out more prominently because I \ndidn't\n love the aspects I've described above."}, {"userName": "Amy Buckle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34739902-amy-buckle", "userReview": "This book intrigued me at first, as most romances do, and I wanted to see how the author\u2019s take on a fiery Spanish romance would pan out. Indiscretion follows the journey of writer Alexander as she travels to Spain to meet the family she\u2019s always dreamed of knowing. After her parents moved to England when she was a child and then her mother died, she had always wondered what her Spanish family were like.The problem I had with the novel is that it never engaged me at all. I never cared what happened to the characters and most of the time I was too confused by all the drama to even keep up with what was happening. I would have liked a more toned down version, with less complication and more raw chemistry. Also as much as Fielding\u2019s ability to describe the sights and smells in the book was undeniable, sometimes it was a little too much. It became so descriptive that I found myself lost from the plot. It also feels like this book has taken a few thousand steps back in terms of female empowerment. Yes, Alexandra is a successful woman but she spends the whole book pining after a guy who is clearly no good for her. Plus every other woman in the book is either a hag or a whore. Not exactly innovative.Something else off-putting about the book was that I kept forgetting it was set in 1950. One minute all the characters seemed to be wearing clothes from the Victorian times and the next I would read pages and pages of dialogue and description which could easily be placed in the 21st century. I feel like more work needed to be done here to keep the book grounded in its time.I don\u2019t like spending an entire review only citing negative points, so I will say what I did enjoy. I liked the authenticity of the Spanish dialogue mixed in with the English, it helped keep the book true to its Spanish setting. I also liked the gypsy characters who added more excitement and I enjoyed their superstition. My favourite character was Ramon who seemed to the most realistic and likeable; most of the other characters were always up and down but Ramon was a calming constant in the novel.Overall the novel was a bit disappointing. I found that Fielding\u2019s writing was nice and she clearly has a talent, but the plot just never gripped me. I also found that there was a lot of unnecessary description and that the narrative could become a little complicated at times, making for the story to be confusing.

The way the author described those places is so vivid, so full of appreciation and respect for history and tradition.

From bull fighting matadors and the mysterious Gypsy encampments in the grounds of the family\u2019s estate, to the passionate dances of the region and the incredible horsemanship of the local caballeros, Alexandra is instantly seduced by the drama and passion of her new home.When Alexandra inevitably falls for Salvador, the mercurial heir to her family\u2019s estate and the region\u2019s most eligible man, she finds herself entangled in a web of secrets, lies and indiscretion. Alexandra soon falls prey to scheming members of her own family, the jealousy of a beautiful marqu\u00e9sa and the predatory charms of a toreador, all intent on keeping the two lovers apart.But nothing can prepare Alexandra for Salvador\u2019s own dangerous liaisons with a dark-eyed Gypsy. Can Alexandra trust that love will triumph, or will Salvador\u2019s indiscretion be their undoing?I read backwards at first in this...I read Masquerade for a couple chapters and then stopped and went to this book. Hannah's an awesome writer and I must say had I not read a couple of chapters of the second book first, I might not have read it at all and I'll tell you why. This book was intense and at times I felt like the hero was a little wishy-washy. I don't like that. If a book is so long that you're looking for a noose...there's a problem. So why 5 stars? It was a good book but it wasn't my type of book. I'm not into this era and I couldn't get interested or invested enough to like it, like I could the second book. I think there are some people out there who will love it but for me it just wasn't my cup of tea.I was given a copy of this ARC from the publisher on Netgalley for a honest review.

I have always been intrigued about stories set in exotic places. One thing that appealed to me about this book was the setting, which was in Andaluc\u00eda, Spain. Did it live up to my expectations? Well, sadly it did not. Not that I did not like it. Actually, my feelings are mixed, as there were parts of the story I enjoyed, and some not so much. I must admit I was curious to discover how the events would unfold, but the rush to get to the end was not high on my list. A book this size (489 pages) would normally take me on average three days to read, instead it took me over a week.The story follows Alexandra De Falla, a romance novelist, who never experienced being in love. She left London for Spain to re-unite with her estranged family. However, she never expected her welcome to be frosty. She found herself with a stepmother who hated her, a sister jealous of her and a father who was weak and afraid to stand up for her. Secrets, lies and fight for position drove the De Falla clan. Besides the family drama, she found herself caught up in romantic debacle with her cousin Salvador, the man she never expected to fall in love with. She is embroiled in a situation where deceit, jealousy and feuding reigned supremely. Not only does she have to deal with his ex-fiancee; there is also a jealous mistress in the fray. What I admired about Alexandra as an individual was her willingness to embrace the unknown. She was not afraid to step out of her comfort zone. She is a woman who enjoys adventure and experiencing new things. Her stubborn trait, however, would either make her or break her. Unfortunately, my admiration did not extend to Salvador. I had difficulty warming up to him and by the time the story ended, I still was not convinced to like him.I enjoyed the initial set up of the romance, but as the story evolved, it frustrated me. The romance became overly dramatic. This was due in part to the actions of both protagonists. It would appear that he is torn between love and a sense of gratitude and honour, but I thought he was indecisive. I did not appreciate how he treated Alexandra. One minute he was hot and passionate and the next he was cold and urging her to return to England. Her response to his actions revealed her naivet\u00e9 in the affairs of the heart. She used another man to make him jealous, an action which I found detestable. For a moment, I thought I was reading about teenagers playing at love instead of adults who were truly in love. Because of this, I had difficulty connecting with them as a couple. .The story started out slow and it maintained that pace to the end. Readers are introduced to the lush beauty of Spain, its history, the customs and its people. I must confess, when I hear the term gypsies I think of Romania, I never knew that they resided elsewhere. Reading this book, taught me differently. They also live in Spain and appear to be a dominant part of the Spanish culture in the 1950s. The author\u2019s descriptive writing style made me feel as if I were present in every scene. However, there were times when I felt the descriptions were a bit too much, which contributed to the story being lengthy. In spite of this, it was actually my favourite part of the story.There was a particular scene involving Alexandra and her stepmother, which the author failed to follow upon leaving the issue between them unresolved. Gypsies fascinate me, so they being a part of the story was a plus for me. However, I was hoping for more interaction from them, especially seeing that one of their own was intimately connected to the De Falla family. However, the author did not take advantage of this set up, which was disappointing.Conclusion/RecommendationThis book had potential, but it did not grab me has I expected. I have seen where a lot of other readers enjoyed it more than I did, so if you have no problem with the issues mentioned above then you should give it a chance."}], "description": "A young woman's journey of discovery takes her to a world of forbidden passion, savage beauty, and revenge.Spring, 1950. Alexandra de Falla, a half-English, half-Spanish young writer abandons her privileged but suffocating life in London and travels to Spain to be reunited with her long-estranged family.Instead of providing the sense of belonging she yearns for, the de Fallas are driven by seething emotions, and in the grip of the wild customs and traditions of Andalucia, all of which are alien to Alexandra.Among the strange characters and sultry heat of this country, she meets the man who awakens emotions she hardly knew existed. But their path is strewn with obstacles: dangerous rivals, unpredictable events, and inevitable indiscretions. What does Alexandra's destiny hold for her in this flamboyant land of drama and all-consuming passions, where blood is ritually poured on to the sands of sun-drenched bullfighting arenas, mysterious gypsies are embroiled in magic and revenge, and beautiful dark-eyed dancers hide their secrets behind elegant lacy fans?\"Indiscretion\"is a story of love and identity, and the clash of idealsin the pursuit of happiness.
