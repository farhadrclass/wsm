Lucille is thirsty.\nA new era of The Walking Dead begins, and we get back to Rick Grimes and his group of survivors in a dystopian world where zombies roam it.At the ending of the previous volume, Rick\u2019s group realized that their world is larger than they thought. They meet the community at The Hilltop. Rick negotiated a deal with Gregory (Hilltop\u2019s self-appointed leader) that, in change of supplies (mostly food), to eliminate the threat of \u201cThe Saviors\u201d, a violent group that sells protection in change of half of everything of value of each community. Rick\u2019s confidant to be able to beat those so called \u201cSaviors\u201d. Rick was wrong, deadly wrooooong\u2026Enter: Negan\u2026\u2026the fearsome leader of \u201cThe Saviors\u201d.Rick\u2019s group has dealt with merciless enemies like The Governor and also The Hunters, but nothing, NOTHING of that was any useful to prepared them to face Negan, and soon enough they would know that they were out of their league, paying it that learning with precious blood.Negan isn\u2019t only the new villain, but also is the most complicated and hard-to-predict character ever appeared in The Walking Dead so far. Easily my new favorite character in the whole series (both in comic book than TV).Zombies are easy, humans are hard. You know what to expect from a zombie,......but a human? You never can be certain. Rick isn\u2019t certain of anything about Negan and his Saviors.And the blood, too precious blood, will start to run a lot soon."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "[ the scene where Rick and the others are helpless to do anything but watch as poor Glenn is beaten to death by Negan with a baseball bat was as hard to read as anything done yet in this series.

Something has to be done, and you can bet it's going to involve A LOT more bloodshed. Even if Rick's group triumphs against all odds over these animals, what would they have really won?

Some crazy shit happened in this volume, two characters that I liked died, and yet I'm just not as enthralled with this comic as much as I was in the past. I know that it must be insanely hard to write new and exciting stuff in this comic because it may come off as repetitive, unbelievable or overly-dramatic and so that's why I'm being quite generous with my rating. Robert Kirkman is actually good at adding little things in to change it up but when it comes to the plot I feel like the plot is going around in circles. It's just like - something bad happens, they overcome it, they have hope and then something worse happens and then the cycle starts again. The comic has that constant cycle but then I don't know what else Kirkman could throw into the mix to make it different. Aliens? Flying zombies? A crazy army of monkeys? I suppose another interesting thing to note is that I feel like when a character dies, it's not a big deal for me. I've gotten it into my head that all of these characters will die and I don't like them enough to be upset over it. The only characters I really care about are Andrea, Michonne and Sophia. If they died then I would be annoyed but if any other character died then I wouldn't be too bothered about it. Perhaps if I was more emotionally invested in more characters, I would like the series more. Maybe Negan will mix it up. His story might bring back that original excitement I had while I was reading these comics. He's ruthless and I love that he curses so much and the fact that he seems absolutely bonkers. He could be a character that I love and it could be interesting to see more of his craziness!"}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18202588-anna", "userReview": "Human nature never changes...

Action has been put on the back burner through most of the #90's issues in favor of more and more character development. I love character development, but it's comforting to get TWD back to its glorious roots. And this volume did not disappoint.What occurs here is remarkable, because it isn't action oriented like No Way Out or The Governor arcs. It's just goddamn' terrifying. Kirkman managed to create a new Road Warrior-esque villain that is exponentially more daunting than The Governor (who was previously my favorite comic book villain of all time). The Governor was in power, but paranoid; he constantly expected to be overthrown, and was unsure of himself. Negan just doesn't give a shit. He's in power, and he knows it. He revels in it. And for the first time in the series, I have no idea how Rick Grimes & company are going to get themselves out of this one.The fact that we are now almost 103 issues into this series, and Kirkman/Adlard are still finding fresh directions for this comic is a massive testament to their creativity and uniqueness. They are in a league all their own. This is yet another fantastic entry into what is easily one of the best books on the stands, and also includes issue 100 -- one of the most heartbreaking moments I've ever read in a comic book.5/5"}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "Once again, the carnivorous dead take a back seat to the absolute hell that is OTHER PEOPLE.

Also, when I sent my men to kill your men for killing my men you killed more of my men. Not cool.\" - BUT, he carries a very large and very nasty stick. One of Rick's tribe will learn a very, very awful lesson; a lesson that goes on for several pages, in nauseating detail, and left me quite glad, once again, that these books are not in color.This grisly lesson and Negan's parting words - \"Things have changed, Rick. Whatever you had going for you - that's over.\" - leave our fearless leader shaken, and he gives serious thought to surrendering to the zealot's demands.Or does he have another plan up his sleeve?

Now I know: they all joined together under the leadership of Negan, the latest big bad in The Walking Dead.On their return trip from Hilltop, Rick and co. (a name which makes them sound like a window washing company) encounter the first of Negan\u2019s bikers, a fateful tussle that calls down the full wrath of evil Fonzie himself. Rick\u2019s hubris toward Negan leads to the death of two major characters and a new challenge for the group \u2013 but how do they fight overwhelming forces and leather jackets?Negan and the others are a pretty one-dimensional group of people: they are bad, bad dudes who only bully/beat/murder people into getting what they want, and even threaten gang rape of children \u2013 one of them even has part of his face disfigured like a low rent Two-Face! And Negan himself? His opening speech used the word \u201cfuck\u201d so liberally, you\u2019d think it was verbal punctuation (and of course only the baddest of the bad say fuck all the time)! So yeah, they are most definitely the villains and not at all rounded characters.But what they lack in characterisation, they make up for in what they\u2019ve done to the series direction because suddenly the story\u2019s come roaring back to life! The best part of the series so far was when the Governor and Woodbury threatened Rick and co. in the prison, so to have another foe like him, but smarter, with more numbers and better trained men, is an exciting direction to take the series \u2013 far better than the stagnation of the last couple books.Robert Kirkman underlines Negan\u2019s significance by having him kill off two major characters, one of whom has been with the title since the start and whose death was quite shocking, in a way that the deaths of other characters have never been. As gruesome as that scene played out, it was absolutely riveting and showed how utterly compelling a figure Negan is. That said, the other character\u2019s death was unexpected but hilarious, so back to the usual standard for Kirkman! Speaking of poor characterisation, Kirkman suddenly starts writing Rick completely different, as a terrible tactician and leader \u2013 all contrary to how he\u2019s been portrayed so far. Rick makes arguably the worst decision he\u2019s ever made as leader after Negan\u2019s second small group, led by Two-Face, attack: he decides to take some of the most useful people in the group on the road, away from the defensible colony, and head to Hilltop for\u2026\u2026 what? Reinforcements? Except it\u2019s already been established that those people are soft and have no weapons! How useful would they be to the colony? None. Splitting the group compromised the strong position they were in and led to all the trouble in the second half of the book. That single decision was plain baffling, made no sense and felt totally out of character \u2013 Rick wouldn\u2019t be that stupid! It was contrived solely so that Rick and Negan could meet, establish their enmity and nothing else.This is just a minor aside but I found out in this volume that Heath is a dude! Heath was one of the new characters introduced since Rick and co. rocked up to the colony and I thought Heath was short for Heather (not sure why) and that she was a frumpy black woman. She kinda does look it \u2013 baggy clothes, kinda chubby, dreads, glasses \u2013 and there\u2019s no audible voice in the comic to distinguish between male/female. I know Heath was in a relationship with the female doctor but I just assumed they were gay. Then we see Heath without a shirt in this book and\u2026 ohhh. Heath\u2019s a dude! They\u2019re just an interracial couple rather than a gay interracial couple. Wow, Charlie Adlard really drew that character ambiguously \u2013 at least to me! So there we go \u2013 thankfully the spice is back in The Walking Dead in the form of Negan and his army of Fonzies. And how about this for an amazing setup for the next book: Jesus vs The Fonz \u2013 why has no-one ever done this as a comic before?Ayyy!"}, {"userName": "Artemy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39811979-artemy", "userReview": "Eh.

Even by The Walking Dead standards. Yow. In the last volume, Kirkman opened up his world by showing his characters that they were just one of many communities of survivors, and this volume explores some of the dark side of what that means. A terrifying new group of villains beats someone to death in one of the goriest and most heartbreaking scenes in what is already a gory and heartbreaking series. Rick shows some hard character growth as he has to adapt to a new challenge by finding some kind of a new strategy. Romantic relationships get enriched (or violently cut short, as this book tends to do). And the very last page hints at some awe-inspiring events to come in the next couple of volumes. This book is definitely difficult to read - think Red Wedding kind of pain - but a great next chapter in the story, and I highly recommend it for longtime fans of the series."}, {"userName": "Sesana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana", "userReview": "[the way that Glenn was murdered (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2850786-jennifer", "userReview": "The Good: The previous volume was slow and full of setup that we could only hope would pay off.

Two huge characters got killed off what the fuck. I'm so depressed. Negan is fucking crazy and I honestly think he's one of the worst villains in this series to date. So funny story about this particular volume. This might make me a bad person but oh well. I wanted to check it out form the library but for some reason at my local library volume 17 was checked out, but they had volumes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and all the rest. You get the idea. So I went to Barnes & Noble because I wanted to purchase this volume, but then I realized each volume is $15 and I finish these volumes in less than an hour and I didn't feel like dishing out the money. So I sat in the starbucks cafe area in the Barnes & Noble and I read this volume in about 40 minutes and then I put it back on the shelf and left. Hahaha that probably makes me a shitty person but I am so OBSESSED with these comics I couldn't stop myself. And I couldn't just skip a volume and go from 16 to 18, especially not with all the shit that goes down in this one! So... oops. I couldn't wait and I have no self control. It was totally worth it though, this volume is amazing!SPOILERS BELOWOh my gosh so right in the beginning of this volume Abraham dies. ): It mad me so sad because I was just starting to really like his character. I think he got an arrow through the eye or some shit like that as he was walking with Eugene. Negan's \"saviors\" are fucking insane. I couldn't believe how ruthless and cruel they are. There are so many of them and they all want to attack Rick's group. Then they have this terrible run in in the middle of the night, Negan's grabs Rick by the neck with this rope and yanks him off the car. Then Negan introduces his barbed wire bat named Lucille and he tells them that all their property now belongs to Negan, and that this is the beginning of their new lifestyle. He's so creepy and disgusting. Negan starts to play \"eenie meanie minie mo\" and starts to decide which one of them he is going to kill. Then he picks Glenn and it was the saddest thing ever. He hits Glenn over the head so hard that his eye falls out of its socket. Then he continues to bash Glenn's head in with his bat while Rick and the group watch helplessly. It was so fucking sad. Then Negan and his people leave and Maggie starts to beat up Rick cause she's so mad at him. Maggie announced earlier in this volume that she's pregnant with Glenn's baby which makes this all even worse. Maggie and Sophia decide to stay behind at the Hilltop and Rick takes the rest of the group back to Alexandria. Then Andrea tells Rick that Negan's people attacked Alexandria and she took one of them prisoner. Rick decides they can't go against them cause there is too many of them, so he lets the prisoner go, and he decides that they will live in peace with Negan's people. I'm shocked that Rick is basically just rolling over and letting them win but at the same time with all that they've lost and all that they're up against, I understand it.
