The first book, Rush introduced us to three best friends, Gabe, Jace and Ash who are billionaires and the founders of HCM Global Resorts and Hotels. Jace\u2019s character was portrayed as a kind, sensitive, fun/flirty man with a great love and protective nature to his sister, Mia. That Jace no longer exists in Fever, or at least in the first half of the book. Jace is now a controlling, dominant, hot-headed asshole, mimicking the hero, Gabe, of Rush. But there are several issues why this story did not work for me. One being, the initial execution of the plot.Jace\u2019s first encounter with the heroine, Bethany Willis, is at Gabe and Mia\u2019s engagement party. Bethany is working as part of the catering staff, cleaning up after the guests. She\u2019s homeless and trying to earn money for her next meal and then move on to find more work in order to survive. Jace sees Bethany across the room and feels an immediate attraction. Ash sees that Jace is interested and decides to approach Bethany with a proposition. Ash and Jace have always shared women in the past. Threesomes are their thing but Jace does not want that with Bethany. He immediately decides he wants this woman for himself. Ash approaches Bethany in the kitchen which leads to this:\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201dShe glanced up at him. \u201cUhm, does it matter?\u201dHe paused a moment, cocked his head to the side and then said, \u201cYeah. It matters.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered.\u201cBecause we\u2019re not in the habit of fucking women we don\u2019t know the name of,\u201d he said bluntly.conversation\u2026\u2026conversation\u2026\u2026\u2026Jace walks in and is pissed off that Ash has propositioned her for a night with the two of them.THEN Bethany asks\u2026.\u201cDoes this offer come with dinner?\u201dand agrees to a threesome with two men she just met for a cheeseburger, fries and orange juice and a night in a hotel room once she finishes the job.The absurdity of their meeting was such a turnoff for me as well as the heroine\u2019s weakness. Bethany is portrayed as a defeated doormat and in my opinion Jace needed a strong heroine to balance his dominant nature.Another problem I had was the excessive swearing and profanity in the dialogue. I don\u2019t have a problem with cursing when it\u2019s relevant to the emotion in a scene; however it\u2019s a major distraction and unnecessary filler when it\u2019s on almost every single page. When I start counting how many times a character is saying \u201cgoddamn\u201d it is a problem.\u201cBut fuck, baby, you\u2019re so goddamn sweet.\u201d\u201cJust read the goddamn report, Jace.\u201d\u201cEven with his instincts screaming like a motherfucker, he\u2019d allowed it to happen. Every goddamn minute of it, but he\u2019d still let it happen.\u201dThe plot had potential but the overall execution and dialogue in the first half of the story confirmed to me that Ms. Banks writing style has significantly changed from the books I\u2019ve enjoyed from her in the past. I\u2019ve been an avid reader of her Sweet and KGI series and the last few books from both of those series were major disappointments as well. So, at this point I am stepping away from Ms. Banks work and am grateful I will always have Damon (Sweet Persuasion) to fall back on for happy memories."}, {"userName": "Crista", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3194546-crista", "userReview": "[ Jace and Bethany\u2019s first sexual encounter involves Ash, and this creates a very interesting and uncomfortable situation for the remainder of the book.

I\u2019m too disappointed to censor right now.*Please don\u2019t let me put you off reading this \u2013 I\u2019m guessing I\u2019m going to be in the minority with this one.  I like Rush a lot. It wasn\u2019t the best book I\u2019ve ever read, but it was entertaining, and engaging. I LOVED Jace in Rush. After reading the teaser chapter for Fever, I was beyond excited to get my hands on it. I was SURE I was going to love the story.Nope. Not even a little.First, the m\u00e9nage scene in the beginning. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s there. Jace was sure he didn\u2019t want to share from the beginning. The whole time they were doing it, he was sure he didn\u2019t want to share. He could tell that Bethany was into him more than Ash. So why the heck didn\u2019t he speak up \u2013 at any point? I know he gave the explanation that she agreed, and he didn\u2019t want her to get away, but it was obvious, even to him, that she wasn\u2019t doing this for the m\u00e9nage experience. It wasn\u2019t like she was all like \u201coh, a threesome, just what I wanted\u201d As bothered by it as Jace was, even in the beginning, I cannot swallow that he just couldn\u2019t say something. Now, I have no issue with m\u00e9nage in general, but because of this, it felt like it was a totally gratuitous scene that was completely unnecessary, and out of character. Next there was the insta-love. Oh my god. It was bad. I mean, so so bad. It was as close to love at first sight as I\u2019ve seen in a book. I tried to push it out of my mind, I tried to pretend they had know each other\u2026 more then a week, but I just couldn\u2019t get past it. Ever time they would get down to the \u201cyou are my everything\u201d etc. I would just have to roll my eyes. I just couldn\u2019t take it seriously \u2013 at all.Then there was Bethany. If that girl cried once, she cried 50 billion times. I felt like every other page tears were filling her eyes. I don\u2019t have a problem with heroine\u2019s crying. I don\u2019t need every heroine to be independent - kick ass and take names, but Bethany was just SO fragile. And more than that, her being that fragile just didn\u2019t make sense to me. This is a girl who grew up in foster homes, who lived on the streets of New York City for four years. No one that fragile survives a life like that. A life like that might damage you, but it should also make you tough. I just could not like her, or feel sympathetic at all.Then there is the fact that, I still feel like I don\u2019t know anything at all about Jace or Bethany. It\u2019s like they were characters with no real personality or interests outside their relationship. They felt completely one dimensional.Ok, I could go on, but I\u2019ll stop here. Needless to say, my enthusiasm for the next book is nill."}, {"userName": "Komal", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5314014-komal", "userReview": "DNF (last page 258): My general thought process while reading this book: grrrr, meh, should I just quit? Yeah, I need to quit. No! What if things finally turn around?!? Grrr\u2026\" It got to a point where even the dirty sex wasn't worth sticking around for. It REALLY irks me when authors try to piggyback off a genre/author that's blowing up and then add nothing more to it. Billionaire dom + meek heroine, who turns out to be a sub + penthouse setting + a group of close buddies = generic. It wouldn't have been so generic if Banks actually gave life to the characters but they felt so flat and lifeless. Did Jace like anything more then kinky sex and dominance? Did he have a life outside of that? From what I could tell, no. Why were Gabe, Ash, and Jace even best friends? It seemed like they didn't have much in common besides their wealth and the college they attended. It didn't make sense nor did it feel natural. I love smut but there has to, at the very least, be some originality.

I loved that she was quiet and out of her element, yet had a backbone and a delicate strength and dignity. Jace was dominant, no doubt, but most enjoyable for me was the way Bethany stripped away a lot of the artifice and melted his heart. I'm fascinated by the character of Jack, Bethany's stepbrother. I hope we'll see more of him and get his story!Steffi: I absolutely loved the blend of romance and erotica in Fever. Jace is a badass alpha male, no question about it, but he also has a very sensitive and vulnerable side. Surprisingly enough, he has no problems sharing that side with Bethany. I am absolutely in love with the secondary characters, although they don\u2019t play a secondary role in the book. It is great to see Mia and Gabe as a happy couple and Ash\u2026.what else can I say about Ash but that I love him, he is one of my all-time favorite characters and I can\u2019t wait to get to his story.Crista: My favorite movie in the whole world is Pretty Woman starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. I don\u2019t know what it is, but the Cinderella factor always gets to me. The idea that a rich, classy guy could sweep in and rescue a woman in a desperate situation and become her knight in shining armor appeals to my fairytale loving self. Fever is a Cinderella type fairytale with an erotic twist!I thought the chemistry between Jace and Bethany really worked. It was obvious that Jace was completely mesmerized by Bethany from the first moment he saw her, and the initial spark only intensifies throughout the book.- What didn\u2019t work -Elizabeth: There were a couple of scenes that were a little bit overdone, but these were few and far between. Honestly, there was very little in this book that didn't work for me. Steffi: I have to agree with Elizabeth here and say that I loved almost everything about it. I think some people might be uncomfortable with a particular scene in the book but that was just necessary with Jace and Ash\u2019s history. The whole story wouldn\u2019t have been believable otherwise.Crista: The threesome. It is no secret, for those who read Rush, that Jace and Ash like sharing women. Jace and Bethany\u2019s first sexual encounter involves Ash, and this creates a very interesting and uncomfortable situation for the remainder of the book. I must say that the opening chapters that involve the three of them are the most erotic of the entire book, but I wish that Jace had stepped up, gone with his gut, and refused the threesome. It would\u2019ve made the entire book a bit more comfortable without that added complication!- Best Scenes -Elizabeth: My favorite scene was when Bethany went out with the girls to the club. There was such a sense of fun and friendship there. LOVED IT!!Steffi: I don\u2019t think there is a particular scene that I loved but the whole process of Bethany learning to stand up for herself and, more importantly, learning to trust herself, I loved. She learns to let loose, go with her instincts and builds up a kind of courage which she didn\u2019t have before.Crista: One of my favorite scenes was the scene when Bethany is invited to go out with Mia and the girls. They all get highly inebriated and Gabe has to go and deliver a very drunk and loose-tongued Bethany into Jace\u2019s waiting arms. The sex scene that follows is just pure hot, sexy fun.Another favorite scene is when Jace comes home and finds Ash and Bethany in an emotional moment and, in a jealous rage, makes a painful accusation. I loved Ash\u2019s response and Jace\u2019s necessary groveling that follows. I also think this is a big moment for Bethany. In this beautifully written scene, she sets clear boundaries for herself and for Jace.- Favorite Characters -Elizabeth: Bethany was my favorite character because of all that she had to overcome and the strength she found to do so. But, I also found her 'stepbrother', Jack, VERY compelling. I feel that he has a story to tell, and I hope that he'll get the opportunity.Steffi: I loved Jace for his honesty. He knows who he is and what he wants and he makes no apologies for it. He goes all out when it comes to Bethany and not once does he give up on her. I also can\u2019t stress enough how much I love Ash and how excited I am for his story. I think it\u2019s going to be the highlight of the series and an amazing finish to the trilogy.Crista: This surprised me because my favorite characters in this book were Ash and Mia. Jace is incredible and amazing, but there is just something about Ash. I love his personality, demeanor, and charm, and can hardly wait for his book! Mia is also a favorite because she is so accepting and loving towards Bethany, and effortlessly gives this book heart.- Overall Thoughts -Elizabeth: This was one of my favorite books from Maya Banks. FEVER read just a bit differently to me than many other books by this author, and I hope it's a change that's permanent. I felt the author tapped into an unexplored area of her ability and really dug deep to bring this story to life. I love a book and characters with depth and emotional hurdles. I appreciate the story so much more when the characters have to work for their happily ever after. I enjoyed RUSH, but I became absorbed by FEVER!! ~ 4.5 starsSteffi: I already really enjoyed Rush, but Fever knocked it out of the park for me. This is a series worth reading and Maya Banks exceeded my expectations. Don\u2019t be fooled by the billionaire erotica theme. The Breathless Trilogy is much more complex than that and shouldn\u2019t be put in a category and written off. Maya Banks is a master storyteller and her brilliance shines through in Fever. I know I\u2019m repeating myself but I am very much looking forward to the third and final book in the series when Ash finally finds his other half. ~ 4.5 starsCrista: I read this book during a flight, and I must say, between the man sitting next to me looking over my shoulder at what I was reading to the tingles this book gave my girly parts, I\u2019m not sure it was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made! This book is best read in private, preferably near a cold shower!I really enjoyed this \u201crags to riches\u201d tale of a beautiful woman who comes from nothing and a larger than life man who is brought to his knees when he falls in love. I was emotionally invested and felt connected to the characters throughout the book. This is a highly erotic novel that will reach you in all the expected places, but will also touch and engage your heart. Recommended for lovers of erotic fiction. ~ 4 stars**ARC provided to Swept Away By Romance courtesy of author and publisher in exchange for an honest review**"}, {"userName": "Vina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18492568-vina", "userReview": "I loved Jace in Rush but now I'm IN love with him!After reading Rush, the first book in this Breathless trilogy, I wasn't all too impressed. I wasn't that big of a fan of Gabe and his relationship with Mia just was not my cup of tea. I guess all I was missing was the perfect man because I absolutely loved Jace's story!This book has absolutely nothing to do with Rush..Where Rush was all about dominance and since-forever-crush and total obsession, this one comes a bit more intense and highlights the relationship between a very capable, wealthy man and a helpless, defenseless -not spineless, mind you- girl who has nothing at all.They way these three men are such playboys and gradually find women to tie them down is so sweet and I love watching them discover how to love one woman. Jace's need (well, practically obsession) to protect and provide for Bethany is so cute and I wish I had a man like him who wanted to shop and cook for me 24/7. Jace is by far my favorite of these three delicious men, but I've got to say I'm really excited to see Ash's story. That's right, I'm definitely making sure I get to read the last book of this series. The first book may have been okay, but Fever definitely makes up for it!

Don't get me wrong, if this was real life I'd probably look at this couple in horror surrounding the rapid evolution and healthiness of their relationship. Luckily for me, this is not real life--this is fiction. Therefore, I have no qualms enjoying the story. Also, what a way to begin a novel!

I don't know exactly what it was, but I think it had to do with the heroine (Bethany), or should I say the hero's obsession with her--I just didn't get it. Here's this uber-successful alpha-male businessman, with a wild and kinky sex-life (into threesomes with his best friend/business partner Ash), and he becomes obsessed with this uneducated homeless waif. They have nothing in common, he's about 14 years older than her, socially they're miles apart...and I just couldn't fully buy into it. I guess we're supposed to believe that it was sort of some \"love-at-first-sight\" thing, but I don't know. I think it was more like Jace (our hero) was at loose ends because he no longer had to take care of his younger sister (who he practically raised) since she became engaged. Controlling, protective Jace needed someone to take care of, and who better than (way) down on her luck Bethany? This was a sort of Cinderella story, with Jace showering Bethany with things she could never have before (a place to live, plenty of food, clothing, hot chocolate(!)). I did feel sorry for Bethany (she had a rough life with some bad breaks) and I was curious to see where this would all lead. They have plenty of adventurous sex (they match up pretty well here), and Jace lets Bethany in on all his kinks (he likes the whole pain-gives-you-pleasure thing). But all the while Bethany keeps feeling she's not good enough for Jace; questions \"why do you want me?\"--(yes, I'd like to know that too), and generally is an insecure mess. Now, I know what I would've liked to see her do to get over feeling that way (despite Jace's repeated reassurances) but we don't get to see that until the last page of the book! Finally.Jace...\nOh well. I do enjoy Ms. Banks's writing, and she does know her way around a sex scene, but sadly, this one was just ok.

They\u2019re powerful, they\u2019re imposing, they\u2019re irresistibly sexy, and Jace and Ash share everything\u2014including their women.When they meet Bethany, Jace begins to feel things he\u2019s never experienced before: jealousy, and a powerful obsession that threatens him, overwhelms him\u2014and excites him beyond control.Jace isn\u2019t sharing Bethany\u2014with anyone. He\u2019s determined to be the only man in her life, and it\u2019s jeopardizing a lifelong friendship with Ash. Bethany will be his and his alone. Even if it means turning his back on his best friend.I\u2019m not going to lie, I had serious issues with Fever.Jace and Ash are best friends and are known for enjoying a woman together. So when Ash notices Jace checking out one of the wait staff at Mia and Gabe\u2019s engagement party, he decides to proposition her, something Jace specifically asks him not to do. Jace is drawn to the woman and when Ash talks about sharing her, he doesn\u2019t know why but he does not like it. Ash doesn\u2019t listen to Jace and goes after the woman.Bethany, the waitress in discussion, needs this job. She gets to eat the leftovers and it gives her some much needed money. Right away the reader gets that Bethany is homeless. And to top it off, she\u2019s practically supporting her \u2018brother.\u2019Jace and Ash are rich (not quite the way the summary described them as the most powerful men in the country, that\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration) and Bethany is the exact opposite. But they don\u2019t know that.So Ash goes to Bethany to ask her if she wants to fool around. She\u2019s not interested until Jace shows up to get Ash to back off. When she realizes that it\u2019s a threesome Ash is proposing and that Jace is part of the deal, she\u2019s intrigued. She says she\u2019ll do it if they feed her. They think nothing of it and off they go.And this is where I had some serious problems. There\u2019s definitely a power imbalance here. Jace and Ash are in this to get off. And their dialog between the two of them while they\u2019re engaged in sex with Bethany proves that. On page 27 of the pdf copy I had (from Netgalley) Jace says \u201cHer pussy is mine.\u201d I know we\u2019re supposed to see that as some romantic thing, that he doesn\u2019t want to share her with Ash on some level but I did not take it that way at all. I was frankly disgusted that they would refer to Bethany in terms of body parts while she was right there. She\u2019s a flesh and blood woman with feelings who deserves more respect than to be broken down into body parts to be fought over.Contrast that with Bethany\u2019s reasons for the threesome. Yeah she\u2019s attracted to Jace (and Ash but more Jace) but she wants a warm place to stay for the night and a meal. Survival.I was put off by the whole scenario. But hey, Jace is smitten with Bethany and her tiny body and how vulnerable she looks, so this is a romance! I kept reading despite being very uncomfortable with that whole scene. So during the morning, Bethany sneaks off and Jace spends the next two weeks looking for her. He finds out pretty quick that she is homeless which makes him more determined to find her.Once he finds her, he takes over her life, almost completely (Bethany still tries to do some stuff on her own that always results in Jace freaking the hell out). And this whole scenario rubbed me the wrong way too.Jace is a control freak. And really, who else but a homeless woman who has to rely on him for everything could make him happy? Seriously. He wants to control every aspect of her life and he does. He has found his perfect woman.\u201cBut if having her own apartment gave her a semblance of power and at least the guise of having a choice, then he could deal. Because he knew she had neither power nor choice. She was his. Belonged to him. That didn\u2019t change because she had the appearance of independence.\u201d (p. 155)That whole paragraph sums up Jace and his feeling of ownership towards Bethany. He totally loves her right? How infuriating and patronizing and condescending!I like an alpha hero but this was too much. I was not comfortable with this story at all. I could go on but I\u2019m going to leave it there.

When I met Jace and Ash in the first book, Rush, I was highly curious about the woman who would break up this double duo in the bedroom. These two best friends find it highly erotic to be with the same woman at the same time. But now Jace has finally found a woman, who he has formed strong amorous feelings for, and he isn\u2019t willing to share. From the moment Jace sees Bethany serving at his sister's engagement party, he was drawn to her. When Ash notices who Jace is eyeing, he takes it upon himself to proposition Bethany to have threesome with them. This didn't please Jace. For the first time, Jace feels possessive of a woman and threatened by Ash being the third party. But he goes along with the deal anyway, for fear of not having her at all. This one night of passion and erotic sex leaves Jace craving more of Bethany. Jace is the kind of man, once fixated on something he wants, he goes after it. Yet when he wakes up the next morning, he finds himself alone in the hotel. Jace becomes angry and desperate to find Bethany. When Jace does find Bethany, she's bruised and starving in a woman's shelter. Like a knight in shining armor, he rescues her from living in poverty. Bethany, who was once raised in foster homes, was once a recovering drug addict, and is now homeless living on the streets. She comes with a lot of baggage that includes: mistrust, low self-worth, and a friend she loves like a brother, Jack, who continues to take her down a very dangerous path. After learning Bethany's heartbreaking story, Jace is even more determined to have this woman who has consumed his thoughts and feelings. \u201cThe truth is I\u2019ve never felt this way about another woman. The truth is I\u2019m fucking obsessed with you. The truth is I want you in any way I can have you. The truth is if you told me right now that you could never submit to me, never give what I want so badly from you, that it wouldn\u2019t matter. I\u2019d take you any way I could have you. The truth is I\u2019m not letting you go.\u201dI thought it was an interesting twist for the story to have a heroine like Bethany. She's different from a lot of the heroine's I've read here lately - being that she\u2019s homeless and a recovering drug addict. She\u2019s had a hard life growing up and living on the streets, yet she's not hardened by this life. She\u2019s a survivor. She overcame her drug addiction on her own, hoping to make her life better. But jobs don't come easily for the homeless. So when she meets Jace, for the first time in her life, she\u2019s given a second chance to start over. Jace is a great hero, he swoops in and rescues Bethany from a harsh life on the streets. He provides for her. Gives her whatever she wants or needs \u2013 luxuries Bethany is completely unaccustomed to but really appreciates. These two may be total opposites, but they fit well together. This story is has a lot of emotional moments between the main characters that were very touching. It's also super sexy. I really think lovers of erotica will be fanning themselves over the sizzling sexy times between Bethany and Jace. Whew. Unfortunately, this story has a bad case of insta-love, which I'm not a huge fan of. I really wish the author spent some time developing their friendship, slowly building up the relationship before they jumped into a relationship. It felt unrealistic when they were confessing their affections after only knowing each other for two days. I couldn\u2019t help but roll my eyes at times. I understood the fierce attraction, but expressing your heartfelt feelings for someone right away just didn\u2019t work for me. Eh, that may just be the skeptic in me talking too. Gabe and Mia play an integral role in this story which made me jump for joy. I really adore this couple. We also get quite a bit of Ash as well. Part of the story is seeing how Ash and Jace handle their friendship when they are no longer sharing the same woman for the first time. There is definitely a lovely bromance between Gabe, Ash, and Jace. Especially between Ash and Jace. I'm definitely looking Overall, I enjoyed this modern day Cinderella story.

What an explosive last 6% of a book!! I might just add that there is not cliffie though!! (Thank goodness for that!) I am giving Fever 4.5 stars; but definitely that half a mark got added due to the major emotional scene towards the end of this at times emotional book. I will start off in saying that I loved this book way better than the first in the series, even though the heroine tended to annoy me at times. I loved Jace, but I knew I would from when I read book one.Out of Gabe,Jace, and Ash, this story focuses on Jace Crestwall and his love at first sight woman that he spots at his sisters engagement party. Now, I will explain..Jace's sister is engaged to Gabe, and Jace and Ash have always been even closer friends than they were with Gabe. In fact, they were so close that they were in the habit of sharing their one night stands with each other--at the same time!! They were known for their threesomes, and they both wouldn't have it any other way. The night of the engagement party changed everything; but not at first. They do manage to share the gal Jace has set his eyes on,and to his surprise he was miserable during the whole sexual encounter. For the first time, he did NOT like his friend touching the woman in question at all.Bethany is homeless, and desperate to have a meal and a warm place to sleep that night. When she is propositioned by Ash and Jace, she grudgingly accepts their offer. She sneaks off before morning to Jace's dismay.When Jace eventually tracks her down, a heavy duty relationship between these two start. Jace is extremely dominating and needs to be in control in every aspect; both sexually and everything else too. He needs Bethany to submit to him, and he also needs to figure out how to tell her that he takes pleasure in delivering pain during intimacy. He fears that his personality and kinks will scare her off; but he can't change who he is inside. Jace is majorly intense, and I loved every minute of it!! Here are some quotes that capture who Jace is:\"Give me your pain. Give me your pleasure,\" he growled. \"I want it all, Bethany. Every sound. Every reaction. I want all of you.\"\"I'm going to mark you. I'm going to own you. I'm going to fuck you like you've never been fucked. Do you understand? Can you accept that? Tonight you step into my world.\"\"I will absolutely cherish and protect you. See that your every need is met. Your body will be mine, but mine will also be yours. I will love and adore you with everything that is me.\"Jace may be extremely possessive and controlling; but he is also very fair, and he has a protective streak a mile long. I am guessing because he had to take care of his sister since he was a teenager, that is why he is like this. I loved Jace, even with his extreme demands in the bedroom, he could also be gentle when it was needed. Bethany was perfect for him. Considering she had been living on the streets from a very young age, she needed someone who could take care of her and nurture her. My problem with Bethany was that as soon as there was any kind of misunderstanding, she would run instead of stay and try and fix what the conflict was. Also her blind faith in her \"brother\" who was nothing but bad news for her. I do understand why she was loyal to him; but she seemed extremely naive for someone who had been homeless for so long. This is where my 4.5 stars came in, she just tended to annoy me at times.I did enjoy this book immensely, and it loosely reminded me of a Pretty Woman type theme. Of course, Bethany was not a hooker..but just living in such poverty and then being swept off her feet by Jace reminded me of that movie! I highly recommend this series, especially if you are a Maya Banks fan. Like I said in the beginning of this review, the first book isn't near as good as this one; but it still should be read to get the full effect of the three men's friendship. This was a feel good read with some pretty emotional scenes thrown in. The sex was HOT!!! And yes, there were crops, paddles, and some bondage!! Hot,hot,hot!!! This is the kind of story I would read again!!"}, {"userName": "Lori McD", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5878249-lori-mcd", "userReview": "2.5, maybe 3 starsFrom the other reviews, I'm in the minority here. I'm not gushing over this book. Yeah... I really wanted to like this book, and it was a decent read. But it didn't GRAB me like Maya's and Gabe's story did in book 1. It's not a bad book... it probably deserves a 3 star rating, because I *did* read it, and I *generally* liked it. I just didn't feel the chemistry between Bethany and Jace, despite his obsession with her. It really did seem too much like a cross between Pretty Woman and FSOG (with a whole better setup and better, stronger characters).And, unfortunately, this story is completely predictable in almost every way. Sure, I want to find out what happens to them all from here, especially Jack. But was I one bit surprised at what happened? No. The story is fairly well-written and definitely has it's moments, but I didn't feel the *need* to read it to know how it would end.Bethany's lived a hard life, and I empathized with her, even her insecurities. I guess that for someone who's lived on the streets most of her life, this whole scenario would be more than a little overwhelming. While I can see how she'd appreciate Jace's 24/7 almost TPE (total power exchange) - taking almost complete control of her life, giving her a schedule, deciding what she wears and eats, when they have sex, etc. - after awhile, I can also see her rebelling. And because of the way that they've started, will they have built enough trust and love together that Jace will stand by his assertions that he'll take her any way he can get her. 'Cuz in future, I see her being much more independent. It's one thing to allow Jace total control/dominance in the BDSM way in the bedroom and another to allow that same total control/dominance in her everyday waking life.I guess that's the catch: Bethany's life truly has been SO DIFFERENT from Jace, Gabe, Mia, and Ash, that despite how wonderful and accepting and loving these people are, they don't KNOW what it's been like for her. To go from wondering where your next meal is coming from and whether you'll have somewhere warm to sleep tonight to literally anything her heart desires and total protection and control from a man obsessed with her... well, that's going from 1 to 10 in .5 seconds. That's the part of the book that doesn't fit. Doesn't seem real.IF Bethany had a fairly normal upbringing but then something happened and she was out on the street surviving, OK. I could accept it. But that's not the case.And the whole thing with Jack. OK, he's not the best person to be around her. OK, he's got his own issues. But living as Bethany has for so long, the fact that Jace can't see or understand what Jack is to her... the fact that he's so threatened by Jack... well, it says a LOT about Jace and how he's relating to Bethany.To be fair, Ms. Banks TRIES to bring those elements in. But most of it gets lost in the HEA of the romance genre. The harsher edges are smoothed down by appeasing the reader with mild BDSM scenes. Yes, Bethany's realization about TRUST and Jace is very good - very real. But it's not really addressed, front-and-center; it's acknowledged, barely discussed, and then swept under the rug in favor of Jace's determination to be forever with Bethany and provide everything and anything she could ever want.The way that Jace and even Ash talks most of the time, without a subject - \"Wanna blahblahblah...\" \"Have to thisorthat...\" - drove me crazy after awhile. It was totally overdone. No one talks that way all the time.So... I have a lot of mixed feelings about this one. I'm hoping that Ash's story is more in line with some sort of reality."}, {"userName": "Lady Allison", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2802505-lady-allison", "userReview": "This review & others also found on Red Hot BooksLet me preface my review by saying that I loved Ms. Banks' Sweet series. I think she's a talented writer and I have always enjoyed reading the relationships she creates. That being said, this book was hard to get through.This is the second book in the Breathless series, the story of Jace Crestwell and Bethany Willis. Jace is a self made millionaire who sees Bethany at his sister's engagement party from across the room and wants her immediately. Bethany is a homeless woman forced to do odd jobs to keep money in her pocket, since no one will hire her on a continuous basis. When Bethany is confronted by Ash, Jace's best friend and the man he shares his women with, what she sees for the evening is a guaranteed place to sleep and a warm meal for free. She agrees to go upstairs with them both, even though Jace doesn't seem 100% on board. After they spend the night together, Jace wakes up to find Bethany gone and goes crazy. He spends two weeks tracking her down and eventually finds her in a women's shelter and steals her away. This story is very unique in that I've never read about a homeless heroine, and it was very interesting to get inside her mind and watch her face situations most people don't have to. However, I was less than impressed with Jace. He completely took over Bethany's life without thought to how she might feel about it. Granted, she didn't have much of a life to live, but for me, a woman's choice is one of the most important things she has to hold on to. Which brings to me to my biggest issue with this story. I understand that there is a delicate balance between building trust and taking care of the person you love while being the dominant partner in the relationship. However, I felt that the dominance went over board. Jace was more than just \"demanding\" or \"exacting\". He was a pushy jerk. \"Do you understand that I would be in absolute control over every aspect of our relationship, Bethany? Do you really get that? That every decision will be made by me. Where we eat, what we eat, where we go, where you go. When we have sex. When we don't have sex. What you wear. Who you talk to. Are you getting it yet? I'm a controlling bastard and that won't change. Are you really willing to sign on for something like that?\"I don't mind a man taking care of me or not having to think about things for a while, but since when did becoming an all out asshat become a good thing in a hero? He crossed the line so many times it was hard to count. As soon as Jace had taken that step in exerting his dominance, a part of her had sighed in relief. It had been so freeing to hand over responsibility to someone who cared about her. Someone who took care of her and was insanely protective of her. It gave her a measure of security she hadn't enjoyed until now. It made her feel... safe.How can I argue with that? If that's what it took to make her feel safe, who am I to judge? It's just not my thing. My mind rebelled the whole way through. I liked Bethany a lot, even when her constant self hatred got tiring, I wanted her to have a better life and a better future. In the end, I think this may simply be a case of \"not my cup of tea\" - but it may be yours, who knows? Either way, it's a breathtaking cover; I still enjoy the author, but I won't be following up with this series.

This time around we're given the story of Jace and Bethany, a down on her luck homeless woman swept up in an instant and electrifying romance with the billionnaire.I liked the pacing of this book and have to say that although it didn't wow me as much as the first, Maya Banks writes romance extremely well. It was easy to be caught up in it and I found myself finishing it faster because of that.I like Gabe. I liked Jace. But I LOVE ASH! If I'm being honest, I read this partly for the story and largely for glimpses of the enticing Ash McIntyre. He melted me in Rush, even with his limited story time and although I didn't see as much as I would have of him in Fever, the scenes involving him made me want him more. Obviously I can't wait to read Burn!Back to Jace and Bethany. They were very sweet and cute together. Jace was, like his brethern, the dominating alpha male turned soft by the love of the right woman. He was tender and wonderful even when he was angry. And while I liked Bethany, I liked Mia a lot more. Bethany was sweet and deserved her life to change at the hands of a man that would cherish her but I just couldn't connect with her at all. Her naivety annoyed me sometimes but really I didn't empathize with her like I did Mia.Regardless of all that this book, like it's forerunner, was great to read. The chapters aren't excessively long which adds to the pacing and Maya Banks manages to instill interest in the vaguest of occurrences. Its also nice to read about men that have earned their wealth, at a realistic age, rather than the unlikely occurrence of being a billionaire in their twenties.

There were more things that annoyed me in this rather than entertain me. 1. Bethany is a 23 year old homeless girl who's been living on the streets for 4 years yet there is no mention whatsoever of her hygiene. How in the world does she keep herself clean? Showers? Grooming? Clothes? Considering the fact that she agrees to have sex with 2 men 2 hours after meeting them, yeah it was an issue for me. A big one.2. Jace performs oral sex and has vaginal & anal sex with her without using any protection knowing her history with drugs and promiscuity. He never bothered to get both of them tested before going on a sexual marathon (with no glove in some cases). Seriously dude??? You're an idiot.\n\n\n This went above and beyond realism and was just plain moronic. I found it careless and--I'm sorry MB but--irresponsible writing. There is no way you can convince me a girl who had multiple partners and had unprotected sex while doing drugs walked away clean. Yeah right. That's not the kind of fantasy I want to buy into. \n3. The insta-love. I wasn't a fan of this and don't think I ever will be. Sorry but it just didn't work, way too much too fast. After 24 hours of meeting Bethany, Jace is making grand overtures to make this girl his, wanting to own her, take care of her and be HIS forever and eva. Just didn't buy it for a minute. He's spouting words of forever to her and wanting her to live with him after just one week. 4. THIS:\n\u201cIt took two attempts before she managed to open the box and then she pulled out an intricate leather choker with a huge diamond teardrop in the very middle, designed to rest in the hollow of her throat.He\u2019d spent a lot of time searching for just the right piece of jewelry. It wasn\u2019t just a necklace. Far from it. It was a stamp of his possession. A signal of his ownership. It was a...collar. Not that he would tell her that. Later. When she was more comfortable in their relationship. For now, he was content with the knowledge that he knew what it was and that she would wear it.\u201d \n \n\n\nHe bought her a collar. A fucking collar.5. The cheese factor is at an all time HIGH. I don't know what was exactly worse, the incessant swearing that happens every two seconds or the cutesy petname that follows every line. I usually melt when guys get affectionate with special nicknames but the number of 'baby, baby, oh baby' Jace does in here made me want to physically reach in the book and punch the dude. It's not cute. The strangest thing was there was more talking about sex than actual sex. And for the supposed brooding 'quiet' guy Jace likes to talk. A LOT. The dialogue is what exhausted me the most. Very very repetitive and heavy on the saccharine flowery confessions. It's exhausting and I found it extremely hokey. Jace is endlessly described as a dark dangerous quiet guy but he's super emotional and over-the-top in his reactions. I love me some tender affectionate men, but no man acts like this. Ever. I honestly thought this guy was gonna shit rainbows and unicorns the way he carries on. The last 10 pages was a real chore to finish with all the suffocating cornball dialogue. I just wanted everyone to shut up. 6. The swearing. What's with all the 'damn, g-ddamn, fucking bullshit, fucking hell'? It's \neverywhere\n. When you are counting the number of times 'damn' is used in one sentence page then it's a problem. Nobody talks like this. And why the hell are Jace & Gabe using British slang?? The last time I checked guys from the States who are born and raised there do not use the term bloody.7. This was trying too hard. It's as if MB felt compelled to use the overtired 50 Shades template and insert it here with her own characters. And they aren't much different to be honest. Do the guys in all these erotica trilogies have to be arrogant rich jerks hellbent on being obsessive kinky pricks who like to swear a lot? It isn't necessary. And believe me trying to copy E.L James is no prize IMO. MB and every other author I've discovered so far can write circles around her. Similar to Rush, there was little-to-no plot in this, very little character growth or dimension for that matter. And I'm sorry but a girl who pretty much grew up on the streets cannot be as naive and oblivious to things as Bethany is in here. Just, unreal.8. Note to authors: If you have to have your heroine continuously tell readers that the hero is badass, then they are most likely NOT a badass. -__-The only reason this made it on my 'sexy' shelf was because of the threesome with Ash in the beginning of this. That was hot and pretty much the only exciting thing I got out of this.

I didn't feel the chemistry between Jace and Bethany that I did with Gabe and Mia.When Jace meets Bethany it's love at first sight.

When he wakes up the next morning she's gone.Jace tracks Bethany down, but finds that she's homeless.

I felt it impacted how I read their relationship.Bethany makes it clear she loves Jace and wants to be with him, but part of me kept thinking--yeah and the alternative would be what? Go back to the women's shelter.Also I didn't connect with Jace. He's tempermental and demanding, but it's never explained why. His constant swearing actually got repetitive after awhile.I still enjoyed this book and finished it in two days, but since Rush totally knocked my socks off, it was a little bit of a let down."}, {"userName": "Hannah (bookwormstalk)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12190532-hannah-bookwormstalk", "userReview": "3 1/2 starsI really liked that this was a character driven plot. Early on I thought things would go one way, but they didn't and it's a nice change to have a story go a different way than how I expected.Starting out I really liked the story...okay aside from the incredibly uncomfortable threesome, that is. And maybe it's my psych class that had me psychoanalyzing everything (especially b/c we're studying masochism and fetishism currently) but it was different in a not fun way. I don't really know how to describe it. But aside from my personal awkwardness toward that the story had a Pretty Woman vibe to it--which was acknowledged, and I appreciated that. Outside the bedroom I quite liked Jace, and no doubt he has a good soul. I think that a part of my problem is that I saw him as Mia's brother. I know that's a shit poor excuse for sex scenes being awkward but it just was. Maybe it's cause I have a brother--I don't know.All in all it was a good story. I felt like a lot of the conversations were repetitive, but I liked the story line."}, {"userName": "AJ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3143126-aj", "userReview": "3.5 Intense, emotional and smutty stars!Book two in the Breathless series, this book features Jace, the second of three gorgeous, controlling Alphas who are best friends, millionaire business partners and who have always lived by the motto \u201cplay hard and live free\u201d.Gabe has fallen in love but that doesn\u2019t mean Jace and Ash are ready to follow him into a life of monogamy. But then everything changes for Jace when he first lays eyes on Bethany and he is drawn to her like he never has before. He and Ash frequently share women for the night, so when Ash notices who has captured Jace\u2019s attention, he quickly goes about seducing her into their bed. Bethany is painfully shy but she is just as attracted to Jace as he is to her, so when Ash propositions her, her curiosity gets the better of her, and she agrees to join them. Their hot encounter feels all wrong to Jace as he wants Bethany to himself, but he goes along with it as a chance to get close to her and their time together only provokes his obsession with her. So when she disappears in the morning, he makes it his mission to track her down and claim her as his own. \nHe wasn\u2019t sure what the fuck had gone on here, exactly. All he knew was that Bethany was a complete game changer\nBut Bethany is hard to find, as she has a secret \u2013 she is homeless. She lives on the streets, sometimes in a shelter when she can find a bed, and she picks up casual work whenever she can find it. When Jace finds out about her situation he decides then and there that he is going to take care of her. So when he finally tracks her down, he goes all caveman and carries her away from her old life, and into his. Jace is just as controlling and domineering as his buddy, Gabe, but whereas the last book featured a relationship between long-time friends, this one is very fast. Jace is obsessed with Bethany and their need for each other is immediate and very intense, and leads into a deep and meaningful (highly sexual) relationship almost instantly. The book has a bit of a smutty Cinderella-story feel to it. Jace swoops in and rescues Bethany, and then gives her everything she\u2019s ever dreamed of \u2013 in and out of the bedroom. She has learned the hard way that she can\u2019t rely on anyone to take care of her, and she feels that she has nothing to offer him, but Jace is really open with his feelings, and he doesn\u2019t hold anything back from her, making her feel safe and comfortable, and an equal part of their relationship. It\u2019s technically a Dom/sub set up \u2013 but it\u2019s a very loose arrangement, with Bethany still very much her own woman and allowed to take control now and then. \n\u201cYou have more power, more control than you could possibly imagine. My heart is in your hands. That's not bullshit. I'm not saying stuff I think you want to hear in order to manipulate you. I can't be any more honest than this. I'm yours, baby. I'm putting it out there. My heart, my soul, it all belongs to you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s very intense and emotional, with lots of both dialogue and inner monologue from the both of them about how amazing the other person is, and how much they love each other. It was too fast moving for me to get swept away in it all, but I was still able to enjoy it for what it was. I really liked Jace. He did a good job of balancing his control and dominance with taking care of Bethany and letting her be her own person. And I thought Bethany did a good job of fitting into her new life with him. She\u2019s unsure about a lot of things, but she has an inner strength that I admired, and I like that she was able to talk to Jace about what she needed, and was confident enough to stand up to him when he was an ass \u2013 which he was\u2026 more than once. There\u2019s a bit of drama in the form of somebody from Bethany\u2019s past, and it\u2019s tied in nicely to the development of things between Jace and Bethany, and there is also some much needed lightness with sweet moments between them, and some great banter between Jace and his boys. And Bethany's first drunken girl\u2019s night out is fabulous. \n\u201cGabe thinks I look sexy,\u201d she announced when Jace stopped in front of them. \u201cAnd he totally said you'd fuck me in these shoes.\u201d She stopped and frowned, her thoughts suddenly muddled. \u201cOr maybe it was Mia who said you'd fuck me. Either way, I wanna be fucked in these shoes.\u201d\nOverall, I enjoyed this book. Jace and Bethany\u2019s relationship is incredibly intense, and all kinds of dirty, but their connection is definitely a deeply emotional one, and the romance was really nicely written. \n\u201cDon\u2019t let me go Jace. I\u2019m lost without you.\u201d\nI'm looking forward to finishing off the trilogy with Ash's story up next.3.5 stars."}], "description": "Jace, Ash, and Gabe: three of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country.
