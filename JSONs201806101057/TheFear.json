This one written by C. L. Taylor takes this from a different angle with a huge twist making this more of a thriller read. A teacher (Mike) progressively has his interested eye on Louise. Mike is a family friend of her Fathers which made me shudder.Louise finds the attention given to her from Mike at the tender age of 13 a very attractive feature in him.....he \u201cgets\u201d her like no other person does. Least of all her parents. He spends time listening to her, making her feel good about herself. She\u2019s not the most prettiest sought after friend in her school.When Mike decides to take her on a trip, it\u2019s a permanent trip.She\u2019s now on her own with Mike.Mike isn\u2019t the guy she knew and trusted and we, as the reader get insight to how he\u2019s treating her.What I\u2019ve never considered in true stories we hear about such as this, is, the effect it has on the child once she is older and has more knowledge and experience of life.The effect on Louise is tantermount to this thrilling captivating story.Mike is still not forgotten, he\u2019s there, he\u2019s doing it again.Louise is many many years older now.I was hunkered over my seat breathing in every word, every action, every chilling move and hanging on every sentence that the author wrote when I was pushed, yes pushed within this situation that Louise made.I feared for Louise that she would do something stupid.A situation that is known to readers because there have been factual events sadly like this.The concept taken on by the author and turning this into a nail biting gasping reading book just proves to me why I stalk (oops I mean \u201cfollow\u201d) this authors work eagerly awaiting her next book.This is an author that never fails to give me a great read.My thanks to Avon books and to the author."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "EXCERPT: 'Please,please don't do this.

Please, Mike.''I'm doing it because I love you,' he says as he shoves a sock into my mouth, presses the tape over the top and ties my wrists to the bedposts. 'Sometimes I think I love you too much.'ABOUT THIS BOOK: When Lou Wandsworth ran away to France with her teacher Mike Hughes, she thought he was the love of her life. But Mike wasn\u2019t what he seemed and he left her life in pieces.Now 32, Lou discovers that he is involved with teenager Chloe Meadows. Determined to make sure history doesn\u2019t repeat itself, she returns home to confront him for the damage he\u2019s caused.But Mike is a predator of the worst kind, and as Lou tries to bring him to justice, it\u2019s clear that she could once again become his prey\u2026MY THOUGHTS: That ending! I am sitting here, eyes gleaming, shaking my head in amazement! Didn't see that coming. Thought this was a good solid 4-star read right up to the end. But that ending deserves an extra half star on its own. I have read two of Taylor's previous books, The Lie and The Treatment, both good solid four star reads, but with The Fear, the ending makes it stand out from the others. Yes, I keep going on about the ending, but it was jaw-dropping!Okay, okay, enough about the ending. Let's get into the meat of the book. There have been a lot of books written about older men preying on young girls, insecure girls, lonely girls. But what about afterwards? What happens to these girls? What effect does that experience have on their lives? And the other people in his life, his wife, how does she cope? These are the questions that Taylor has used as the basis for The Fear. She takes these people, angry, damaged, vengeful, fearful, and places them in an explosive situation. At one point I didn't know who was sane, or if any of them were. I rooted first for one, and then another. 4.5 stars for an emotionally exhausting but supremely satisfying read.

A Must Read!Fear is absolutely brilliant. It's a perfectly paced Thriller that gave me chills.Louise is back home after her Mum dies.She is called home by her brother to help organise the funeral.However Louise wants to be anywhere but home. You see Louise knows if she comes home she will unlock all her painful memories.Louise was abused and groomed by her teacher Mike! He went to prison for his crime. But Louise fears he is at it again! She is determined to stop him! This story has many angles, twists and turns, secrets and lies. It's creepy, incredible addictive, things are not always what they seem or who they seem, illicit affairs, revenge, grooming, abuse.This is not an easy read at times but it's utterly brilliant.C.L Taylor weaves a fantastic story together that gets deep under your skin.Highly recommend this gem of a book.A Must read!

L. Taylor is one of my favourite authors and I was delighted to receive an ARC of her new book The Fear. I was hooked by this story from the first page. An excellent thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. I did not want to put it down. Louise was groomed and abducted by an older man when she was a teenager. This has affected her life and relationships. Eighteen years later she goes home to settle her fathers affairs after his death and finds that her abductor has started grooming another teenage girl. Louise has to stop this quickly at all costs.

This book is about child grooming and at times it's not an easy read. It tells how easy things can get out of control. This book is true to life, gripping and quite disturbing. It covers jealousy, dominance, paedophillia and revenge.

IT\u2019S FINE THE BOOKS LIVED.What I loved about this one mostly is the way the story pans out in strange yet such believable ways. Lou discovers that the man who groomed her in her youth has his sights set on another teenager \u2013 desperate to prevent another child from going through that horrifying experience she sets out to stop him. What follows is an utterly gripping, often quite scary and genuinely compelling story, with many clever little psychological levels exploring the fallout from all those years ago upon more people than just Lou..I did have to ignore (it has to be said) the random insertions of things that just didn't exist in the timelines that were in this book. I'm not sure about whoever copy edited this one but really, watch the technology folks! And the timeline if you are mentioning famous people in your plot! Most of it is more recent than it feels! But you know, this one was about the characters for me and the edgy feeling I had whilst reading it. The Fear is as emotionally resonant as it is entertaining, we learn what Lou experienced all those years ago and no punches are pulled \u2013 when in the present day Lou starts to get to grips with her trauma through the sheer determination she has to make sure no more lives are ruined, it is kind of uplifting. Even with the rather rash actions she takes, often with no filter, which kind of brings on the entertaining part\u2026Whether intentional or not, for me Wendy was the shining character in The Fear \u2013 for a start she is definitively divisive in that C L Taylor way, but oddly easy to love. It was another strong feature of this novel that the author didn\u2019t stick with victim and perpetrator but explored wider angles and implications which just gave it an added depth beyond that of twisty psychological thriller.Overall an excellent read. You\u2019ll be glued to the pages, enthralled, often aghast, compelled to the rather excellent end game.Big thumbs up from me."}, {"userName": "Warda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30036082-warda", "userReview": "[3.5 stars] That ending, holy moles!"}, {"userName": "Adrian Dooley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51106307-adrian-dooley", "userReview": "Wow what an intense read. My first experience of C.L. Taylor\u2019s writing and I really don\u2019t think it will be my last. The story of Lou Wandsworth and her involvement with her karate teacher Mike Harris. When she was 14 she ran away to France with him for a weekend thinking she was madly in love with him, but of course she soon finds out that Mike isn\u2019t all she thinks he is. Now 32, Lou finds out that Mike, now out of prison is grooming a 13 year school girl Chloe Meadows and Lou is determined that history won\u2019t repeat itself and let Mike ruin Chloe\u2019s life like he did hers. Wow this was one intense read. Delicate subject matter of course and it\u2019s quite disturbing in places but I found this an utterly compelling read. Lou is a great central character and the flashback device works great here as we find out slowly the horror of what went on in her childhood all those years ago. Another thing I liked was, when she was doing things that had me thinking \u201cwtf? this is a bit much\u201d she was also asking herself \u201cwhat am I doing\u201dThe story plays out great with several different threads that are all connected and don\u2019t play out like you originally think. All the characters were very believable, easy to remember who was who, always a sign of good characterization and writing. The ending and how it played out, I loved. It just felt a really satisfactory conclusion after having had so much invested in this tense and gripping read. Loved this one. Can\u2019t really find fault with it. My first read of this author but it certainly won\u2019t be the last. Many thanks to NetGalley, Avon Books and C.L.

Mike grooms Lou and following the start of a relationship he takes her to France to start a life together. Once they are in France Mike's personality changes and he keeps Lou locked in the bedroom.

Lou was groomed by a much older man when she was a young teenager and now it\u2019s many years later and she\u2019s still struggling to get past it. Grooming is one of those words that sends a chill down my spine as a parent to two girls, the manipulation and abuse associated with it put the fear into me, what an aptly titled book.This is told from multiple perspectives, Lou both in 2007 and via her diary entries when she was fourteen, then you hear from Chloe, the teenager who Lou fears is being used in the same way that she was and finally, Wendy. You\u2019re never quite sure exactly what Wendy\u2019s angle is or how she fits into the story, but when it\u2019s revealed I did one of those, oohhh I see what you did there moments, super clever! This is extremely fast paced and sharply written, it begs to be read in one sitting as there\u2019s so much tension and anticipation about what will happen next, both in the flashbacks and the 2007 storyline.I don\u2019t want to discuss the plot much more, just know that if you\u2019re a psychological thriller fan, this is a must read. The characterization is just as strong as the writing and the story is gripping, I really couldn\u2019t ask for more!The Fear in three words: Absorbing, Shocking and Thrilling."}, {"userName": "Book Addict Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7403283-book-addict-shaun", "userReview": "I am a big fan of C.L. Taylor\u2019s books and so I couldn\u2019t wait to read The Fear. It\u2019s an uncomfortable read in places due to the subject matter but it had a really strong opening that immediately had me glued to my Kindle as events began to unfold. We see Lou returning to Malvern after the death of her father to tie up loose ends and sell the property. Lou witnesses the man that she ran away with to France when she was a young teenager kissing another young girl in a garden centre and immediately knows that he has been grooming this girl too. And so Lou now knows that she needs to bring this predator to justice, but how she will do that is unknown to her and what\u2019s also unknown to her is the true danger that she is about to find herself in. We start to read about how Lou and Mike first ran off together and the story is disgusting in places but it is a believable portrayal of how a young girl was groomed and the character of Mike is despicable. Witnessing events in the past and the present starting to collide had me feeling genuinely sick but I couldn\u2019t stop reading to see how things would continue in the present day. Interestingly I never really took to Lou as a character, or at least the adult version. She makes some silly and naive decisions and the way the story goes involving her and Mike in the present day became almost comical rather than something serious. The situation she found herself in I felt was just stupid and as the story started to drag on I found myself getting bored and willed the story to just hurry along. The shining light in this tale I would say is Wendy. Whilst it\u2019s obvious early on who she is, it isn\u2019t revealed until later so I won\u2019t go into detail except to say that it was her character I enjoyed the most. However I found even her believability was stretched a little at times but she was at least a more interesting character to read about than the adult Lou. My biggest issue with this book though and what continued to throw me off as I read was the abysmal editing. The present day scenes are set in 2007 and I counted mentions of PS4s, Coldplay\u2019s Paradise, unreleased smartphones, vaping, 4G, Sia\u2019s Chandelier, Minecraft, the 5p bag charge, Terry Wogan\u2019s death and a very advanced Facebook. For those on it in 2007 it didn\u2019t have 1/8th of the stuff it does now and it certainly didn\u2019t have an app. You can expect mistakes in books whether it be accidental grammar or spelling errors but I don\u2019t expect errors as huge as this from an author like C.L. Taylor or a publisher like Avon. It is said that the predator in this story isn\u2019t on the sex offenders\u2019 register because he was released from prison before it was set-up, so was this added in at the last minute and the story then changed to be set in 2007? I just can\u2019t see why an author of this calibre would set her book in 2007 otherwise and then go on to make so many mistakes. It might seem like I am being dramatic but it honestly ruined the experience for me and I was constantly on the lookout for the next unreleased thing that would be mentioned and can\u2019t believe many others haven\u2019t picked up on it. The ending I felt was rushed and a little bit clunky and all over the place. Events just happened too quickly and as the story itself was dragged out, I don\u2019t know why this ending had to be so rushed. It also to me set quite a bad precedent to victims and was I felt the typical psychological thriller ending, written for that shock value ending rather than a realistic ending. Characters go from being nervous wrecks to suddenly being completely in control of situations and able to become manipulators rather than the manipulated. Whilst others have clearly loved this book, to me it was a huge letdown and so as always I say that enjoyment from books is subjective and so while I don\u2019t personally recommend The Fear, others do so take a chance on it and see what you think."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10281457-laura", "userReview": "Book reviews on www.snazzybooks.com I was completely gripped by this story of revenge and fear! It provokes a mix of emotions, from anger to fear to disgust (when you read more about Mike, you'll probably feel all these too), all taking place against a worryingly 'normal' backdrop - and I was completely sucked in!The characters in this novel really drew me in - I cared about main character Lou and the elements taken from her diary make you see what it's like to be an unhappy child with a seemingly less-than-loving family, and how worryingly easy it is for older men to prey on these kinds of teenagers. It really makes you think about this, and though it's not a pleasant topic, it is very interesting to read about. When Lou realises Mike, having been released from prison years ago, is grooming another young girl, she vows to stop him - and ends up taking things a lot further than planned! I also really liked Wendy, despite her many faults, and felt that her inclusion in the story was brilliant as it takes the reader away from just focusing on the victim and offender - there are so many other people affected by this kind of crime too, and Wendy made for a very interesting character to read about!I loved that C.L. Taylor writes in a way that makes you completely get how things can so easily spiral out of control - both for Lou as she confronts Mike and for poor confused Chloe, and in fact everyone around them (including family and friends) as they fail to recognise the importance of what is going on right under their noses. The story is written in such a way that you think you know exactly where it's going... but you really don't!I raced through The Fear and would definitely recommend it as a gripping read which is as much about the characters' struggles as it is about action itself - a truly thrilling read with an added layer of substance!* Many thanks to HarperCollins UK for providing a copy of this novel on which I chose to write an honest and unbiased review. *"}, {"userName": "Between The Pages Book Club (Gemma M) ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36095519-between-the-pages-book-club-gemma-m", "userReview": "WOW.

As a parent it put the fear of god into me reading about Mike and how he grooms girls. It was scary to see how easy someone can prey on someone so young and vulnerable. It was also so easy to see how a young adolescent would fall for it.Lou has tried to get on with her life but has struggled to form any lasting relationships with a man due to what happened in her past. Returning to her family home has her bringing up a whole load of memories and emotions that she would rather forget.Mike literally made my skin crawl, the more I read the more I loathed him. I was literally right there beside Lou willing her to put an end to what Mike was doing before he got his grubby hands on another unsuspecting victim.The Fear is a chilling read that sadly portrays what is happening now in the real world.

L. Taylor. The Accident seemed so full not only of unlikely events, implausible characters and occasional howlers that I seem to have perpetrated a go-to review for readers who found it distasteful. Then I won online a signed copy of The Lie, and after long choosing and beginning late found it excellent. So, seeing the number of five-star reviews for The Fear I let my experience cast my deciding vote to rank this author.To begin with what the author does well \u2013 a complex plot unwinds with endless invention. Just when it begins to feel that we\u2019ve a grip on what\u2019s unfolding, the story takes another turn or a new character comes into play. As in Taylor\u2019s previous books, we have a dual track time scheme, tho\u2019 strangely the main story is set in 2007, which places the backstory before 1990, when the 14 y/o Lou eloped to France with her Karate instructor Mike. There is no reason at all for that time frame, except I suspect that English law regarding sexual offenders has tightened and someone like Mike dealt with more severely these days. The mobile smart phones (they have a big role) in this novel also seem more intelligent that those we had in 2007 \u2013 at least mine. Just when it seems we have Mike immobilised, the situation is reversed.What Taylor does badly \u2013 most of the characters are both not only unlikeable but preternaturally stupid. Both the schoolgirl victims (Lou in the backstory and Chloe now) have a set of parents so negligent and insouciant that their dtrs should have been taken into care. Chloe\u2019s dad even encourages her relationship with Mike even tho\u2019 he\u2019d been banged up for five years for his escapade with Lou. The characters\u2019 stupidity and credulity helps keep the plot twisting, tho\u2019 at one point carelessness crossing the road restarts the story.I have read lots of these stories about adult-teenager amatory relationships, from comical/satirical like Tampa to full-scale classical tragedy such as Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls. To make the great ones succeed artistically requires the older character be at least superficially attractive, ideally representing maturity and sophistication to a teen who finds her contemporaries childish and boring. Mike, on the other hand, is an out and out boor who goes about beating up French waiters. Even later as a thirty-something Lou is several bricks shy a full load, given to lying to the police, her employer, her lover, and the girl she wants to rescue. I kept wanting to scream, \u201cTell the truth!\u201d both to her and to the other characters.The book also left me with some moral and spiritual questions. The unforeseen twist at the end that some readers raved about raised both artistic and ethical problems. Those who have higher expectations than the \u201cwow-I-didn\u2019t-see-that-one-coming!\u201d readers expect \u201cthe reveal\u201d not only to be a surprise, but to knit the story tightly into an organic unit. Here the opposite happens: the characters\u2019 failure to reveal all they know could well have had much more serious consequences than they realised. Even books that fall short of expectations can teach us something, and The Fear (poorly titled, BTW, not at all scary) has helped me clarify my rating system. An exciting plot gets three stars; four requires engaging characters, and for five add both artistic and spiritual value. I also wonder why I found The Lie so much better. Mostly I expect it was the exotic setting. It also features a sexually abusive dangerous lout, but it\u2019s easier to imagine finding him at least superficially attractive as a phony guru in an ashram in Kathmandu than driving as a white van man in Malvern."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11410830-paul", "userReview": "The Fear \u2013 Every Parent\u2019s NightmareCL Taylor is back, with yet another blockbusting, totally gripping, intense psychological thriller. This really will be disturbing if you are a parent of a teenager, especially one that may not have too many fans, and suddenly has secrets you know nothing about.Like all Cally Taylor\u2019s previous books, this will grab you by the throat, keep you enthralled from beginning to end. I lost a whole afternoon reading this, thought I would read a few chapter then watch the football. The football came and went of which I saw absolutely nothing, so engrossed by The Fear, gripped. Lou Wandsworth is now 32, and has attempted to forget about her teenage years, when she was groomed and went with her Karate teacher to France. For what she thought would be a weekend away turned into something more. When the police eventually catch up with them, she is too scared to give evidence against him when the case comes to court. When she returns home for the first time in years, she that Mike, that teacher has not changed.She sees him grooming a teenager, Chloe, and she will do all she can to make sure that what happened to her never happens to her. At first, she feels like she is screaming in the wind and nobody is listening.Wendy, has never forgiven Lou, and she has been stalking her from a distance and wants to get close to her. She knows Mike would never have gone to France if Lou had not tempted him and corrupted him. She will do anything to hurt Lou and make her suffer, just as she has had to when he went to prison, and when he came out and abandoned her.What, will Chloe, Lou and Wendy do as they realise they are all victims of Mike, who has a terrible violent streak, and not afraid to hurt them. What action will they take separately and together? What will unfold and who can stop Mike, the police just do not seem interested.With more twists than in a hurricane you will be totally gripped by The Fear, as you fear the only winner will be Mike. He has the power, he has the skills and he knows how to hurt. This book is gripping, disturbing, claustrophobic and utterly compelling. This book will bring to the fore the fears of every modern parent, grooming and their teenage child. The Fear reminds you it can happen to any child.This book will have you from beginning to the end and proves why Cally Taylor is a bestselling author. Her writing of psychological thrillers is as addictive as any drugs and you will not regret reading her latest hit."}, {"userName": "Poppy fairy ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18322003-poppy-fairy", "userReview": "Review by www.favouritenovels.wordpress.comTwitter@favouritenovelsExcellently written. I can see why this book is called The Fear, I had fear running through me. I couldn't stop turning the pages. I thought in a way that all the characters were psychopaths in their own way . I was hooked into this story from page one. For me I would say The Fear is totally my favourite by C. L. Taylor. Louise Wandsworth runs away to France with her teacher, Mike , where he surprised me by turning violent towards Louise.

Is this a humdinger or what?!When Lou Wandsworth was fourteen years old, she found herself involved with her much older karate teacher, Mike. On what was supposed to be a romantic trip to France, she is rescued and Mike is sent to prison. Lou and her mother left the village they lived in for London and never came back. But now Lou\u2019s father has passed away and Lou needs to clear out his house so it can be sold. With her life in pieces, she decides maybe the time has come to confront Mike, whom she blames for all the disastrous relationships she\u2019s had. But then she discovers, Mike hasn\u2019t changed at all and firmly has his sights set on yet another young teenager, Chloe.The story is told through the eyes of Chloe, the now thirty-two year old Lou and a woman called Wendy Harrison, whose part in the story isn\u2019t immediately clear though, I felt, rather easy to guess at. The Fear is very much a character-driven psychological suspense story. These three characters are all incredibly flawed and damaged in their own way and while not necessary likeable, they do evoke a level of sympathy. While this may not be a fast-paced plot, I found watching the characters develop and change throughout the story extremely compelling and fascinating.At almost 400 pages, this isn\u2019t exactly a quickie read and yet I devoured it in one sitting, flipping the pages faster and faster as I got closer to the staggering conclusion. There\u2019s a constant threatening vibe and some parts make for some incredibly uncomfortable reading, especially where Lou\u2019s past is concerned. But wow, could it possibly have been any more riveting?! I think not. The Fear held my attention throughout, had me completely captivated and I just couldn\u2019t put it down.I\u2019ve arrived rather late, though still fashionably I\u2019m sure, to the C.L. Taylor party and this is only the third book I\u2019ve read by her but it\u2019s most definitely my favourite so far. Some day, I will hopefully have the time to catch up on her older work but for now, I will eagerly await her next offering while you and you and yes, you as well, grab yourself a copy of this one!"}, {"userName": "Mandy White", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33018840-mandy-white", "userReview": "C L Taylor is definitely on my list of go to authors.... I have really enjoyed all of her books and this one was no exception. I was hooked on the story and finished it in a day. Great characters, all of whom had their secrets and reasons to not like them.The story jumps between the past where a 14 year old Lou is groomed by her much older teacher who then takes her off to France., and the present 18 years later where Lou discovers that Mike is doing the same thing again with 13 year old Chloe. We learn just why Lou is the way she is now and why she is determined to stop Chloe going through what she has.A great book, highly recommended. Thank you Avon Books UK and NetGalley for a copy of this book to read and enjoy in exchange for my honest opinions."}, {"userName": "Claire Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41673027-claire-wilson", "userReview": "As a big fan of the previous novels by CL Taylor, I was itching to get my hands on The Fear and it was worth the wait. With characters you love to despise and twists at every turn, The Fear was hard to put down. When Lou is groomed at an early age by Mike, her judo couch, her experience makes it difficult for her future relationships. When she returns to her hometown as an adult, and sees Mike kiss a young girl, Lou knows she cant let it happen again. Gripping. Thrilling. Fantastic. 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Cora \u2615 Tea Party Princess", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4166936-cora-tea-party-princess", "userReview": "5 Words: Trust, betrayal, manipulation, family, danger.Review to come, but I couldn't put it down."}, {"userName": "Joanne Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25524955-joanne-robertson", "userReview": "Strangely enough, both books I\u2019m reviewing this weekend have a similar issue at their hearts. Both feature the grooming of schoolgirls by men in positions of trust but both have very different (but just as thrilling!) outcomes!! The Fear builds upon the idea of revenge by a past victim as a way of saving the child he currently has his sights set on. But what if that girl doesn\u2019t believe she\u2019s in danger and what if there\u2019s someone else out there watching and waiting to dish out their own idea of justice? The Fear explores the reactions of three different characters affected by the actions of Mark Hughes, leading to some extreme acts of violence and vigilantism.The main theme threading its way through the plot line of The Fear is that of revenge. But can revenge be justified if it actually saves someone in danger? Lou has lived with the horror of what happened to her as a teenager for over 18 years but it doesn\u2019t take much for the terrifying memories to return. When she returns to her fathers house after he dies she starts to stalk Mikes home and place of work where she realises he hasn\u2019t changed. His relationship with 13 year old Chloe spurs her on to report him to the police but Mike is a clever predator so Lou decides to take matters into her own hands. Those scenes were very tough for me to read. They were filled with some very raw emotions and the palpable fear and tension between Lou and Mike was positively electric! And as the book continued to twist and turn towards its shocking conclusion my heart was hammering in my chest and my fingers whipped through those pages as quickly as I could.I\u2019ve been a fan of C.L. Taylor since her debut and every book she delivers seems to get better than the last. I loved the differing perspectives here of the women and children who\u2019s lives had been touched by the perverted actions of one man. As a parent who knows how fantastic it is to have the wonders of the internet and smart phones in our world, it\u2019s scary how easy this technology makes the grooming of our young people. Young girls especially don\u2019t even realise that what is happening to is wrong and it\u2019s not until they look back with the experience and knowledge of an adult that they realise how they were exploited. So it was an intriguing idea to create a character like Lou who\u2019s emotions we were able to explore as a 14 year old and also how they had then changed by the time she was an adult.This was a gripping thriller that I have no hesitation in recommending to fans old and new. Shocking, violent at times but utterly compelling I absolutely loved it!"}, {"userName": "The Book Review Caf\u00e9", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57975133-the-book-review-caf", "userReview": "There are a handful of authors books I would happily pick up without reading the book description and C.L. Taylor is one of them, she has the ability to turn a well used subject in fiction and turn it into the most twisted and extraordinary tale. The Fear is no different, Shocking, compelling, fraught with tension and guaranteed to keep you turning the pages as if your life depended on it.Anyone who is a parent with a teenage girl will immediately be struck by a sense of unease when they pick up this book as it deals with the uncomfortable subject of a grooming, although it\u2019s very much part of the plot it never felt unjustified and the author shows a great deal of sympathy and understanding towards the victims. Told from three POV Lou, teenager Chloe and the mysterious Wendy the author has an uncanny knack of breathing life into her characters so much so you feel their emotions and their pain but most importantly they are very credible. Lou and Chloe both take the same path, and \u201cfall in love\u201d with a predator, they are each at different points in their life, and yet they still share so many of the same emotions guilt, hatred and fear to name but a few.Another character who deserves a mention is Mike how I detested him, he literally made my skin crawl. Poor Lou and Chloe both starved of affection and desperate for attention as children made them the perfect \u201cvictims\u201d for Mike. It makes you realise how driven and manipulating pedophiles are in their pursuit of their prey, and how vulnerable girls are drawn into harmful relationships. What made this book an original read were the different characters perspectives of their relationship with Mike and the exploration of the after-mass of such damaging relationships and the complex emotions involved.The second half of the book takes an ominous turn and I\u2019m sure some readers may find this part of the book \u201cfar fetched\u201d I just thought \u201cwho knows what we would do if we found ourself in a similar dilemma\u201d so I was happy to go along with the direction C.L. Taylor took The Fear. The telling of Lou and Chloe\u2019s story is imaginative, compelling and shocking, it\u2019s a story that those who enjoy a book with moral dilemmas will find thought provoking, but at the same time a highly engrossing read.

I think I actually may have become slightly addicted to this book.Yes, it\u2019s an uncomfortable subject matter, child grooming, paedophilia and child abduction. Yes, there is extreme violence and underage sex. However, unfortunately we know from recent news reports this does occur in the real world, but C.L. Taylor has managed to create a page turning, gripping thriller which I thought was brilliant and easily give 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Donna Maguire", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7997643-donna-maguire", "userReview": "https://donnasbookblog.wordpress.com/...I love this author\u2019s books and as soon as I read the blurb and saw the cover I knew it was a book that I needed to get my hands on \u2013 I was intrigued and drawn in straight away and I just love that cover!I found the book to be a really addictive read, I didn\u2019t want to put it down and read it in a few hours. I was gripped by the plot as soon as I started reading and the flashbacks and memories from the main character really drew me further in to the story.I can easily see this happening and as a new parent it would be my worst nightmare when my daughter grows up, there have been a few news stories of Teachers abducting children and if must be a horrific experience for a parent to have their trust broken in this way. The characters are believable and it is an excellent psychological thriller. My only warning for readers is that the book covers grooming and sexual abuse and manipulation amongst what is often perceived to be darker subject matter. I don\u2019t want to give away any spoilers but the book won\u2019t be for everyone in view of the subjects covered but they are dealt with very well.Definitely five stars from me \u2013 another excellent book from C.L.

CL Taylor is one of them. With her trademark black cover and compelling blurb, there's a definite air of excitement in this house when her latest novel drops through the letterbox.Although I have really enjoyed all of this author's books, I do think that her writing improves with each and every book, and The Fear is, in my opinion, most certainly her best yet.The Fear deals with one of the most disturbing themes imaginable; the male authoritative figure who takes advantage of young girls that he is trusted to care for. We know that it happens, but it's rare that this is the subject of a fictional novel, and CL Taylor has dealt with it so cleverly. She pulls no punches when she describes, via Lou's teenage diaries, just how Mike groomed her. The desperate need to be loved and cherished that screams through Lou's diary entries are heartbreaking at times.Lou is now 32 years old and her experiences as a teen have shaped the rest of her life. She's unable to maintain a relationship and is still looking for that elusive feeling of being loved. She's returned to her childhood home after the death of her father; another man who let her down as a youngster, and despite his attempts to make up for the hurt that he caused, never really redeemed himself in Lou's eyes.When Lou discovers that Mike, the guy who groomed and abused her all those years ago, is out of prison and up to his old tricks, she is determined to stop him, and to make him pay.The reader then becomes a witness to Lou's deteriorating state of mind, as she desperately tries to get Chloe; Mike's newest victim and the police to believe her.Lou has managed to create a life that on the surface appears quite stable and normal but as her fears grow and she realises that Mike is outwitting her at every step, she begins to crumble. Rash decisions and dangerous mistakes time and time again, which the reader witnesses ... and it's often a difficult and disturbing reading experience.Lou is a brilliantly created character, but she's not the only one. Mike himself is sleezy, dangerous and completely bad, he will make your skin crawl, I can assure you. Nestled between Lou's story is the voice of Wendy; a character who begins as something of a mystery but turns out to be so integral to the plot. CL Taylors's teenage voices are incredibly well done too; both Lou's younger self and Chloe are desperately vulnerable, damaged and flawed.The explosive scenes towards the end of the story are fast-paced and frantic as these three female characters are brought together to conclude the book with an unexpected but stunning finale.Once again, CL Taylor has proved that she's up there with the very best of current psychological thriller authors. The Fear is without doubt, her best book yet."}, {"userName": "Jack Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37897404-jack-jordan", "userReview": "A very original, VERY twisty thriller.

Oddly enough though I didn't feel any fear myself while reading this! The Fear is a gripping look which deals with an uncomfortable subject matter, dealt with in a sensitive manner. The story is told from the view points of three ladies all which have the same man in common. For Lou, they ran away together to France when she was just 14, Chloe appears to be seeing him currently and she is only 13, and then there is Wendy who I never really took to, and stuck me as a bit odd, up until I realised how she fitted into the story at which point she becomes far more interesting. There are some twists and turns that although I wasn't gasping at, I didn't see coming, and they came at just the right pace to keep you on the edge of your seat as you were reading this. The Fear had a different feel to it the authors previous books, it didn't quite get under my skin in the same way but the writing was still fabulous, and the story was certainly different to other books in the genre. I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Fear and found myself completely absorbed by the story.

Infatuation and childish love can be all encompassing so it 's painful to read of a woman who hates to think back to this powerful love as she can now see what it really was.
