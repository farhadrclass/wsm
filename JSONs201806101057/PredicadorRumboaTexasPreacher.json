Then he hooks up with Tulip, his gun-toting ex-girlfriend, and Cassidy, a 90-something year old Irish vampire who likes whiskey as much as he likes blood. The three join forces on a quest to find God and kick his ass for his neglect of humanity as they fight an international religious conspiracy and the toughest supernatural killer ever seen in all of creation. It\u2019s not Richie Rich, that\u2019s for sure.It\u2019s really easy to get caught up in the shocking stuff that happens in Preacher. This is a comic series where a character casually states, \u201c Curiosity won\u2019t just kill the cat. It\u2019ll bite it\u2019s head off and stump fuck the remains \u2018til the sun comes up.\u201d And that\u2019s mild compared to some of the other stuff that gets said and done. Frankly, there are images in the panels of Preacher that I\u2019ve sometimes wished I could get out of my head.But look past the shock value, and you\u2019ll find a comic classic with almost limitless ambition and wildly original story to tell. At times, Preacher reads like Irish-born Garth Ennis\u2019s love letter to America. It\u2019s also his exploration of the legends of the American West, the nature of religion, the depravity of people, and the limits of friendship and love. Despite the gore, the sex, the language, and the violence, this is a series with a strong sense of morality. Jesse and his friends are outraged and disgusted by the depths people will sink too, and the quest to find God is a carry over from that. Jesse is angry with what he learns about the nature of God, and sees him as a vain hypocrite who created people and then just lets them suffer while expecting them to praise his name and not lifting a finger to help. And to Jesse\u2019s cowboy nature, that\u2019s an insult that deserves a reckoning.Joe R. Lansdale says it best in his introduction in this volume: \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a learning experience, but it\u2019s a thinking experience, but most important\u2026it\u2019s unique, and I hope it\u2019s uniqueness does not encourage a hundred writers to go out and try to repeat it. What they will come up with is just meanness for meanness\u2019 sake. It won\u2019t have the edge, the special feel of PREACHER. They\u2019ll just be imitations. Because there is only one Garth Ennis, and only one Steve Dillon, and only one PREACHER, a tale out of Ireland, dragged through Texas with a bloody hard-on, wrapped in barbed wire and rose thorns. And it\u2019s out to get you.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "This book is something else!

And I did.The story thrives on a combination of graphic violence, humour, and weirdness. The main character, Jessie, the eponymous preacher has acquired a rather fine super-power, he has the voice of God, and when he uses it everyone has to obey him. He is ably supported by his girlfriend (currently a freelance assassin) and a drunken Irish vampire. The opposition is provided by Jessie's less than lovely family, a Vatican hit squad, and also heaven and hell.Jessie proves to be a rather unusual preacher, a hard-drinking and dangerous man with a violent past. He has questions for God and is unsure what to do with his newfound power. The whole thing is off-beat and addictive.The art is well done and supports the story. When I finished I immediately wanted the next one. It's a series with gallons of potential. My experience reading on is that it goes gradually downhill but even by book 6 it's still a fun read.I've recently watched season 1 of the TV series based on the graphic novels. It's not a close match but retains the key elements and is good. Give it a watch.

Thankfully, there's plenty to enjoy!The Saint of Murderers is great and the bits about the angels is too sweet and delicious not to chortle over, but the best parts have got to be the interactions between Jessie, Cass, and Tulip.

If you've never read Garth Ennis before, this is a good place to start. Because odds are, you're going to love this series, or hate it. And, by no small twist of fate, odds are that you're also going to either love or hate Garth Ennis. Why would you hate Ennis? Well, because his work contains graphic ultraviolence, vulgarity, and blasphemy on pretty much every conceivable level. Why would you love Ennis? For pretty much the same reasons. So my thought is you might as well just in and learn what side of the fence you're going to be on right off the bat."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "This did not go the way I expected at all. I haven\u2019t heard a dissenting voice from anyone about Preacher. Not one, although I\u2019ve not looked at any of the reviews here on goodreads. In fact, I\u2019ve had numerous friends say, \u201cYou have to read this book,\u201d and, \u201cDude, you will love this book,\u201d and since it was all from people I trusted, loving Preacher was my expectation.Nope. I hated this book. First, this book is populated by the most idiotic array of stereotypes and caricatures (certainly these characters can\u2019t be called archetypes) outside of a Circus Sideshow:Foul-mouthed, sexed-up, lost his faith Preacher? \u2713Foul-mouthed, sexy, Preacher-loving-hating Moll? \u2713Foul-mouthed, ultra-violent Vampire (but he\u2019s Irish. Isn\u2019t that original? No. Not terribly.) \u2713Foul-mouthed, racist, Texas sheriff? Cormac McCarthy-style, unstoppable, amoral Saint of Killers? \u2713Cocky, arrogant, bureaucratic, disbelieving FBI Agent? \u2713Too butch, sado-masochistic, homophobic homosexual? \u2713Big city, throw-the-book-out-the-window, abusive super-cop and his bumbling partner? \u2713Overbearing warrior Angels, sexy Demons, idiotic heavenly functionary Angels? \u2713An absentee God? \u2713Dog-faced boy?\u2713I find nothing compelling about this cast of assholes, and I am usually a fan of assholes. I can care about assholes if they are unique and I can believe their behaviour. Not this bunch, though. Second, Garth Ennis is an Irishman writing about a Texan douchebag wandering the U.S., and there are times when it is distractingly obvious that Ennis is not American. His Texan characters speak in ways Texans would never speak. It might not happen often, but it happens enough that I noticed, and oddly enough, when they slip, they speak precisely like someone from Ireland. Go figure. Couldn\u2019t this story have been told just as effectively in Dublin or Belfast as the starting point? Couldn\u2019t the Preacher have been a priest? Perhaps the Vampire could have been a Yank, then? I think it could have been all of these things, and had it been I wouldn\u2019t have found myself constantly being yanked out of the comic by inappropriate vocabulary and regional cadences.Third. the humor was awful. Had one character been a smarmy dipshit, quick with the cutting, insulting banter, I probably would have loved him/her? But the fact that EVERY-SINGLE-CHARACTER (with the exception of Saint of Killers and a cop named Tool) was capable of smarmy dipshittery drove me mad. The dialogue was painfully one note -- and there was a ton of it. The dialogue just goes on and on, like a Quentin Tarantino table talk, but without the entertainment value. If this is any indication of Ennis\u2019 usual writing, my expectations have fallen into a muddy trench; one I\u2019d be happy to leave for the danger of No Man\u2019s Land.Sure there were some interesting moments and wannabe twists (all of which Ennis telegraphed too obviously), but they were not enough to save this comic for me. I worry that I expected too much, though. I truly expected greatness. I thought I was opening something on par with Alan Moore\u2019s best, and with expectations like that there was no way Preacher Gone To Texas could succeed. For that reason alone, I will take a crack at the second volume, but Ennis better hook me with that book or I am all out."}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "They're making a TV show based on the comic!!! This could be really cool! And it's got this guy (Dominic Cooper) playing the lead character named Jesse Custer.I can get behind this idea. So this story is about a - yes you guessed it - preacher who is having doubts about his faith. He gets possessed by a half-demon, half-angel hybrid named Genesis. This entity can make people do whatever it wants. Turn them into puppets. Nifty trick, that.Tulip is the whiny, angsty ex-girlfriend. (I hope she doesn't stay like that through the whole series. But she has a story and isn't quite what she seems either).My favorite is Cassidy, the vampire (of course). He don't give no shizz 'bout nobody. An Irishman, smoker, drinker, rabble-rouser. Badass. There were some funny moments in this. Like the introduction of a character named Arseface who tried to emulate Kurt Cobain by blowing his head off, but didn't quite do the job right and ended up surviving but with a mangled face, and you can't understand what he's saying, so there's this little translation box down in the corner. It's wrong, but so funny in an over-the-top, sick way. I didn't really like all the police stuff. There's a side story of a nice cop who has the worst luck ever and his partner who is of course the cop of the year - steals all the glory - but is also a racist and homophobe (yet secretly gay and into messed up BDSM orgies). Yeah, there's some weirdness going on here. But I like it.I didn't tear through this, and it's maybe more of a 3.5 star read, but I'm rounding up because it's twisted and right up my alley. Custer's also got some supernatural, can't-die cowboy dude after him (well, after Genesis) and it's kind of a road trip story also? There's a lot of violence and generally offensive stuff like racist police officers using racist language. But I still enjoyed it. The illustrations were cool. The story could have been a little better overall, but this is the first volume, so a lot of it was set up."}, {"userName": "Trudi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi", "userReview": "After reading Kemper's awesome review I knew I'd be getting to Preacher eventually -- now after having read the first volume I'm left wondering why the hell did I wait so long?! It's bloody, gory grit and gasoline pulp Texas style, with demons and angels and a possessed preacher, an Irish vampire and a supernatural gunslinger known as the Saint of Killers -- who reminded me instantly of Roland Deschain crossed with Randall Flagg.Something has gone very wrong in heaven: a terrifyingly powerful entity (the offspring of an angel and a demon known as Genesis) has escaped to earth and binds itself to a mortal man -- Jesse Custer (redneck preacher of a small Texas parish). Jesse needs answers fast as the dead bodies start to pile up around him and the po-po are hot on his tail. Joining him on his quest (and evasion of the law) will be his ex-girlfriend Tulip, and a ninety-something year old Irish vampire called Cassidy. There's a vicious serial killer on the loose too just to keep things from, you know, getting boring. The word from up on high is that God has left the building. Literally. Fucked off and left humans to fend for themselves. That's not going to stand for Jesse, and he's decided it's time to smoke God out of his hiding hole and get some answers. Maybe even a little payback, who knows? I surely don't, but I can't wait to find out. Yeah so make no mistake: this thing is profane. It's violent. But there's an energy and an aliveness running through the story that's absolutely addictive. I can see why this series has stood the test of time (and will continue to do so I'm sure). But don't take my word for it: in his introduction to the series Joe R. Lansdale calls Preacher \"scary as a psychopathic greased gerbil with a miner's hat and a flashlight and your bare asshole in sight.\" Heh heh. An effective metaphor to make any butt clench up I'm sure. But this is what really got me: Because there is only one PREACHER, a tale out of Ireland, dragged through Texas with a bloody hard-on, wrapped in barbed wire and rose thorns.

From the insane violence combined with the wildly original story, the first volume of Preacher did exactly what it was supposed to do: hook me and leave me begging for more.Following it's unexpected escape, the dangerous offspring of an Angel and a Demon bonds with Jesse Custer, a lone Texan minister. Now with the word of God embedded within him, Jesse forms an alliance with his ex-girlfriend Tulip and a drunken Irish vampire named Cassidy as they embark on a journey to find God - and not in the \"I'm saved/born again\" sense but the \"I'm going to kick your ass for deserting mankind\" sense.I'm going to try and give you my thoughts on the first volume but it would be hard for me to live up to the excellent review written by Kemper.- I honestly have no idea where this is headed, which is awesome.- The excessive violence and the profanity could be distracting IF the writing had been terrible (i.e. \nDie Hard 2\n). Thankfully, it's not. It never feels like Ennis is throwing all of this offensive material at you to get your attention, it fits right in with the setting and characters he's presenting.- I will admit to being shocked on more than a few occasions. I'm not saying that I have this wealth of experience in \"torture porn\" films or explicit writing but I've seen my fair share of gore.

So the story takes place mainly on terra firma with interludes to heaven, where the powers that be don't really want Genesis around, too dangerous and too powerful. So they send the mean old saint of killers down to take out our hero.\u00a0Jesse is a pretty cool character and tagging along we have his ex-girlfriend Tulip who didn't really push any buttons for me and the vampire Cassiday who was a little more interesting in typically violent blood sucking fashion.\u00a0The artwork was ok, the story was the clincher for me, ending in our three heroes setting out to find the one and only, God, who has forsaken mankind and is apparently wandering about somewhere after acquiring a suitable disguise.

When books are compared to movies it has been my experience that for the most part, the books are better than the movies, except for perhaps \u201cThe Wizard of OZ\u201d where the movie, in my opinion, is defiantly better. In the comparison of a graphic novel to a television show, it becomes quickly apparent that the story in the graphic novel could not presented on the in home screen. And let me be clear I don\u2019t want to disparage the television show in the slightest, it is what it is and it's entertaining, and comparing the two is an apples and oranges kind of comparison. For a comic that is 20 years old now (originally published in 1996) and tells the story the way it does, it holds up amazingly well.

Its as though a child wanted to prove how adult he was so he filled his book full of sex and swearing and crude jokes so everyone would know he was really mature. And so, as I have found with a lot of these adult comic books, it ends up feeling more juvenile than many of the ones that do not attempt to be labeled as adult. I really wanted to like this book. I had heard it was funny and thought provoking but found it was neither. It tried really hard to be funny, almost as hard as it tried to be shocking. The main purpose of this book though is to shock. But it even fails there since it starts to all feel so juvenile that I can be no more shocked than I could be from a junior high kid who is trying to sound tough. Demons and angels having sex, rapists, congregations exploding, and a kid trying to kill himself but ending up with an \"ass face\" make up just some of the events in this book put in merely in order to shock. If you want an intelligent funny story with religious, and moral commentary and compelling characters than don't read Preacher. If you want a comic for adults don't read Preacher since it clearly was not meant for adults.If you want obscenity and violence put in for the sake of obscenity and violence, as well as constant attempts to offend, then Preacher is for you.I'm starting to think I don't like Garth Ennis.

Take it from me, sometimes one read is not enough for something that's really different. Preacher is this insane mix of western, supernatural horror, romance, and black comedy. One of those \"impossible\" genre combos but it seems to work, at least for me on a second read. It's dark, romantic, creepy, hilarious, exciting, crude, and horrifying. It can definitely be offensive to the religious, the animal lover, the southerner, the Texan, the police, the criminal, the teenager, pretty much everyone. But that's good, because we're all too serious and self-important anyway. \"Christ, I think I'd grow old overnight if I lost you.\"Hidden under Garth Ennis' wild violence and profanity is a story of drama. Jesse Custer, our hero, suddenly has incredible power and finds himself in the company of an Irish vampire, Cassidy, and his ex-girlfriend Tulip. There's John Wayne, angels and demons, something called Genesis, and the Killer of Saints. But it's really Jesse's story of coming of age through absolute hell, and his arrival upon his well-deserved power and vengeance, that is the meat and potatoes of the book. And it's filled with brilliant writing like the quote above. Between Steve Dillon illustrating, one of my all time favorites Matt Hollingsworth coloring, and Glenn Fabry illustrating the covers, this is a fantastic looking book!

I didn\u2019t know much about the plot, only the few things I read in some reviews and on the book page. Nothing could prepare me to this. I heard the name of Garth Ennis for the first time with this comics, but I will not forget anytime soon.This is an incredible story, with at the center three unlikely heroes: Jesse Custer, a precher possesed by a spiritual force, able to compete with God, his old girlfriend, Tulip and Cassidy, an Irish vampire. The goal: find God, mysteriously disappeared and face him.The story is amazing, violent, blasphemous, with some ideas about religion and myth that are brilliant, intriguing and crazy. Ennis put many human question about God to a practical basis, using a disillusioned preacher for give a voice to them. Besides, he develop then in a excellent way, showing the worst side of the society through all the violence of which human beings are capable.The artwork is not so defined, but you have to think that it has more than twenty years. Besides, it reachs the top in the pictures about supernatural, for example in the different types of angels and their skills, but also in the representation of violent scenes, that in many cases are more efficient than words.Interesting to note that there is a western tone in this story, regarding the clashes between the team and the police, some of Jesse's principles, but also for a certain friend of him.Personally, I love this series, but I understand this is not for all."}, {"userName": "Oriana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana", "userReview": "book #11 for Jugs & Capes & my latest entry at CCLaPFirst of all, I understand that it is totally unfair to read only the first two volumes in a series and purport to have a reasonable grasp of said series. My friend Keith, a crazed comics fan who has become the unofficial backseat-driver of my comics tastes, criticized Jugs & Capes for this when we read the first two volumes of Fables a few months ago. He sees this as a problematic pattern: the indie comics we're reading are all self-contained, but then we're trying to \"get a taste\" of mainstream comic series by reading the intros to different series, thus putting mainstream comics necessarily at a disadvantage. But what else can we do? If you're not a die-hard comics-phile with limitless time to dedicate to seventy-plus-issue series, how else can you even get started? And listen: I get that you wouldn't try to judge an entire prose novel on the strength of its opening chapters, but you would decide from that whether you wanted to keep reading or just ditch the book and find something else. No one thinks that's unfair. So while I admit that I didn't read nearly enough to judge Preacher as a series, I do think I have the right to discuss how the first books affected me, and why I have little intention of reading any more.The other introductory comment I'd like to make is that we were all primed for Preacher by reading reviews insisting that this series was not for the faint of heart, that there was pretty much something here to offend everyone\u2014the blood and gore were horrifying, the language exaggeratedly profane, the plot obscenely sacrilegious, and on and on. So though I am a bit squeamish when it comes to violence, I love cursing and hate organized religion (more on this later), and I was kind of pumped to see if these books really could offend me. Turns out: not really.So. Preacher is the story of reluctant redneck preacher Jesse Custer, his sort-of girlfriend Tulip, who is a hitwoman and general bad-ass, and Cassidy, their angry drunk vampire buddy. Oh, and it's also about how God has abandoned his post in Heaven, a demon boning an angel to spawn a scarily powerful force called Genesis, Jesus as an overbearing prick, and a dirty, angry, cruel, horribly fucked world. As expected, the profanity didn't bother me, the blasphemy made me mostly giggle, and the violence... well, the violence did upset me, but not how I'd thought it would. The truth is, I was more upset when the violence stopped upsetting me than I was when it did. I don't mean this in the \"We're all going to become criminals because of desensitization to violence in pop culture\" way, but I do think that desensitizing your readers does a serious disservice to your book and your point. Preacher is supposed to be edgy and dark and devastating, but after you see a man whose flesh has been cut from his face, a hideously disfigured failed suicide, an angel with the back of his head blown off (brains visibly dripping through the hole), and dozens and dozens of shootouts and bar brawls and stabbings, it just stops being shocking. And then what's the point? I suppose I respect the fact that they kept finding new and different ways of hurting and killing people, but it was a somewhat bored admiration, a cataloguing of novelty rather than an appreciation of the intensity of the scenes. And to me, that's a failure. And speaking of failures? Racism / homophobia. I get that this story takes place in Texas, and I get that there are all kinds of closed-minded people in the South. But there are scenes that are just too much, like one where a band of cops bat about the n-word and f-word (not fuck, the other one) willy-nilly. No. What's the point? It wasn't even as if it were targeted; if one of the characters had been black or gay and the cops'd shouted slurs at him or her, okay, maybe. But this was a different thing, this was just racism as a shortcut to characterization, which is awful. There are lots and lots of other ways to demonstrate that these men are ignorant and stupid. If this was done as an attempt to shock and push the same boundaries that the extreme violence does, that seems juvenile as well as offensive. (So maybe Preacher actually did manage to offend me?) Worse than lazy characterization, I think the racism played a part in making the overall plot more clich\u00e9d. Even though our \"hero\" is a gun-toting, violent semi-psychopath, our ragtag cast of \"villains\" are even worse\u2014way worse. And one of the laziest ways to make a sharp distinction between the good guys and bad is to show that the bad cop is a racist homophobe. I felt the same kind of failure\u2014lack of nuance, lack of development\u2014in the \"good\" guys. Jesse and Cassidy are dangerous motherfuckers, but they seem to view violence as an itch that needs to be scratched, not a last, or even second, reactive resort. At one point they kill a dozen men in a bar because one of them denigrated Laurel & Hardy. Sorry, but that's fucking ridiculous, especially since Jesse is meant in some ways to be a moral arbiter. He's a preacher, for goodness sake! I get that he's also a \"good ol' boy,\" but that doesn't go far enough for me. In order to show morality, I need some gradual buildup to violence, I need to see him try to reason with people before breaking their fingers, I need to believe that he'd really rather not have to kill yet another yokel, but he will if he really really has to. Otherwise he's just a nasty thug, little better than the nasty thugs he's senselessly butchering. And finally, let's talk about the religious stuff. I'm a pretty staunch atheist, raised Jewish, and I tend to regard modern religions in the same way I do ancient mythology: as wild stories. Often allegorical stories, sure, but I have none of the religious hangups or residual guilt that so many modern (and especially lapsed) Christians do. So the Catholic guilt aspect of this story\u2014which is clearly another of its shortcuts to emotional intensity\u2014didn't affect me the way it likely would have if I were, say, a Catholic. I guess that means I'm missing a significant part of the impact of this story, but it also means I could treat it like a story, without bringing any emotional baggage to it. In any case, I'm not saying Preacher was all bad; I did find the plots engaging and the dialogue punchy and believable. The art was of a type, of course, but clearly top-notch, especially the poster-quality chapter openers (which Keith informed me are the original covers of the single issues). The cursing didn't seem nearly as overdone as the violence, and the religious themes were interesting in the same way any fantasy plot would be. But look, in such a massively overcrowded media landscape, when every book I read means at least a hundred others that I never will, this one (well, these two) just didn't do it. Of course, let's bring it back to the idea that these two books are possibly just an intro, a bit of throat-clearing and balance-finding, and most likely if I were to read more of the series, I'd get more and more enmeshed in the story. But I just don't feel like it's a story I particularly care to get enmeshed in. As with all epic fantasy, I'm sure the good guys are going to win, and of course Jesse and Co. will kick a lot of motherfucking ass while doing it, probably up to an including the asses of God, Jesus, and all the angels. I'm sure it'll be an interesting (and very, very bloody) journey to watch them get there, and I hope lots of people enjoy following it. I just won't be one of them."}, {"userName": "Danger", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5184971-danger", "userReview": "2ND READ-THROUGH: It\u2019s been about 8 years since I first read Preacher, and since I\u2019ve been watching (and loving) the new television series, I figured what better time to revisit the source material?

The show is ok to me, but the graphic novel is so much more. What can you really say about it? Psycho, dark, hilarious, brutal, disgusting, and excellent are some of the first things that come to mind when describing this. You have to read it to believe it.

My advice: give this one a pass and move on to something better, like \"The Sandman\", \"Persepolis\" or \"The Unwritten\".UPDATE: Upon reading many of the reviews I think I understand a little better the root of this series' popularity. It's got swear words! It's got brutal and unnecessary violence! It's got racist & homophobic epithets! It's got an insultingly-streotypical portrayal of the American South/West/SouthWest that is rivaled only by the Family Guy episode \"Boys Do Cry\"! It's got insulting portrayals of religion, religious people, and religious figures! Oh how DARING! In short, it's a lazy, crass appeal to the adolescent. It's the sort of thing a High School student would write/draw, believing their ideas to be SO original, but which even small children would recognized as tired, cliched and lowest-common-denominator-approved.

That graphic novel, my friends, is \u201cPreacher: Gone to Texas\u201d and man, was I in for a wild ride of my reading life!\nWhat is this story about?\nReverend Jesse Custer was a minister who was starting to lose his followers and his faith in God. But one fateful day, Jesse Custer is hit by a bright light which ends up destroying the church he was holding his sermons in. Jesse survives the catastrophe, but everyone who attended the church was all killed and Jesse ends up being on the run from the law while gaining the power called \u201cthe Word of God\u201d where he can control people into doing what he wants. Joining him is his ex-girlfriend Tulip and an Irish vampire named Cassidy (vampires? Yeah, this story is getting weirder) and the three companions set out on a journey to find God, who had quit his job in heaven, so that way, Jesse would get his answers about why Genesis is inside his body. Unfortunately, a hunter sent by Heaven is after Jesse and his gang in order to prevent Jesse from finding out the truth!\nWhat I loved about this story:\nGarth Ennis\u2019s writing: Wow\u2026just wow. Now before I get into what I enjoyed about Garth Ennis\u2019s writing, I would like to point out how shocked (and impressed) I was with the amount of language in this graphic novel. Never, had I read a graphic novel that managed to drop the \u201cf\u201d bomb on every single page along with some other coarse language. This actually interested me rather than disgust me because I was basically counting how many curse words popped up on each page every time a character was speaking and I had a fun time with it! Since this is basically the first graphic novel I had read by Garth Ennis, I was amazed at the creativity being put into this story, especially for the fact that Garth Ennis took a subject matter so controversial (in this case, religion) and turned it into an interesting fantasy story that was extremely well written. It was also interesting in how Garth Ennis explored American culture through Texas and how the main characters are the ones who are more sympathetic than the rest of the characters featured since they are trying to make the world a better place, no matter how TWISTED it may sound! My favorite character in this story was probably Cassidy, the Irish vampire as it was so unusual to see a vampire pop up in a story about religion. I also loved his personality as he is probably the funniest character in this story and I loved the fact that he was willing to help out Jesse and Tulip when they really needed it.Steve Dillon\u2019s artwork: Steve Dillon\u2019s artwork was pretty impressive as the characters\u2019 facial expressions are realistic and effective. I also loved the way that Steve Dillon illustrated the gruesome scenes of some of the characters being killed and the artwork was done so vividly that I found myself cringing at the murder scenes.\nWhat made me feel uncomfortable about this story:\nAll the negative things that I had mentioned (murders, controversial use of religion, language) are actually things that I did enjoyed about this story since it is rare for me to read a graphic novel that is basically covered from head to toe with offensive content, so it was basically second nature to me when I was reading this volume. However, this might not go over well for anyone who does not like coarse language and strong violence, so anyone who does not like violence and strong language might want to avoid this graphic novel. Now, the REAL REASON why I gave this volume a four star rating is because I felt that the pacing of the story was a bit slow in some places as the characters would spent a good majority of the book talking and not much action happens during these scenes. While I do want good character interactions and this comic definitely has some good character interactions, I also wanted to see more action play up in the story.\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall, \u201cPreacher: Gone to Texas\u201d is easily one of the most OFFENSIVE, CRUDE, CONTROVERSIAL yet INTERESTING graphic novels that I had ever read and I would recommend it to fans of Garth Ennis\u2019 works and readers who love reading controversial books!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "Garth Ennis is definitely one of my all-time favourite comic book writers. I forget which series I read first - his Punisher MAX run I think followed by The Boys - but I do remember coming to Preacher very late in the game, despite being told it was his finest work to date. And I remember reading it and thinking, no, it\u2019s not. Re-reading it recently, I\u2019m still not convinced and I\u2019m baffled at most readers\u2019 overwhelmingly positive response to it. Jesse Custer is a former bad boy turned preacher in a Texan town who one day gets superpowers from God and accidentally burns his entire flock alive. He meets his old flame/hitman, Tulip, and a random stranger called Cassidy who\u2019s also an Irish vampire, and together they look to hunt down God - who\u2019s on Earth somewhere - and tell him what a lousy job he\u2019s doing with Creation. Meanwhile, the Saint of Killers, an unstoppable killing machine, is on Custer\u2019s trail. The book opens with Jesse, Tulip and Cassidy sitting around a cafe table nattering away, and it\u2019s this setup that bothered me the most in the volume: they\u2019re always sat round cafe tables reminding themselves (and the reader) who they are, what they\u2019re doing, and why they\u2019re doing it. I guess Ennis really liked Pulp Fiction and Tarantino\u2019s other movies and thought it\u2019d be riveting to have his characters mimic that style - and that\u2019s fine, there were plenty of Tarantino copycats in the wake of Pulp Fiction - but he can\u2019t emulate Tarantino\u2019s dialogue successfully enough and instead his expositional summary dumps became extremely trite long before the end. The characters didn\u2019t grab me - I don\u2019t really care about boring Jesse whose quest to find God or whatever isn\u2019t interesting in the least, and the other characters like Tulip are about as two-dimensional as you can get. Cassidy plays the louche slacker (a quintessential 90s archetype that still annoyingly crops up now and then) whose jokes fall flat every single time. \u201cI\u2019ve got this brilliant recipe for quiche. You make the quiche, right, an\u2019 then you cook it, an\u2019 then you throw the stupid fuckin\u2019 thing out the window. Then you grill yourself a t-bone an\u2019 eat that instead.\u201d Ugh. He comes up with drivel like that all the time and it\u2019s so irritating. I\u2019ve seen lots of reviews that mention that Preacher is gory and bloody, etc., and it is but not enough to really warrant it being THE thing to know about the book. If you\u2019ve read Ennis before, you\u2019ll already know he writes gory comics - The Punisher, The Boys, Jennifer Blood, War Stories, hell, practically every Ennis book contains the same amount of gore as you see in Preacher, so I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s worth pointing out about this comic. It\u2019s a bloody story but no more so than any other Ennis and/or Steve Dillon book you\u2019ll read. The setup is just boring. Some weird thing from Heaven (which is real) called Genesis has escaped and become part of Custer who now has the Word of God, meaning he can will whoever into doing anything he wants with his voice. And because the world\u2019s gone to pot, Custer\u2019s going to find God and tell him to sort it out, make him care somehow, probably using the Word of God? Meh. I\u2019m not sure why Tulip or Cassidy are along for the ride either. I guess neither have anything much going on? Which is always a compelling motivation to have\u2026I really like Steve Dillon\u2019s art so seeing that here is always awesome, and Ennis\u2019 murder mystery in New York City at the end was ok. At least that had a story rather than characters standing about telling the reader about themselves and their situation while they waited for the Saint of Killers to show up. You can also see the prototype for Detective Soap from Welcome Back, Frank in Detective John Tool - the two are comically incompetent detectives chasing after much more competent criminals. And Arseface still makes me laugh - he\u2019s a Kurt Cobain fan who tried committing suicide the same way as his hero with a gun in the mouth but miraculously lived and whose face now looks like an arse! The scenes where he\u2019s trying to be upbeat and cheerful to his grim father who can\u2019t bear to look at his son were so damn funny. But overall there\u2019s very little to like in a 200+ page book that\u2019s hugely rated by the majority of readers. First volumes aren\u2019t always indicative of the series as a whole. I wasn\u2019t that impressed with the first volumes of Sandman, Y: The Last Man and Scalped but went on to adore the rest of the series. And Ennis has written enough brilliant books to warrant a level of trust other writers wouldn\u2019t, so I\u2019ll keep on with Preacher.
