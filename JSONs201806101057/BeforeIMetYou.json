Or a rapist. He was a legend.\n\n...and that folks, is where I cried. There is something about a story where the truth comes out of hiding that really does something to me. While I didn't quite make it to Jellicoe Road snot-inducing tears, there were still plenty of buried hormones which bubbled up to the surface - enough to produce a steady stream of tears to run down my face for a couple of minutes.I was about due for a book to stir up some emotions in me. Sometimes the apathy can actually get tiring! Experiencing Before I Met You felt like a jump-start to my soul. I needed these feels! The words were so pretty! I kid you not, I was lying on a screwdriver in my bed and was vaguely aware of something poking me, yet I kept on reading because I was completely enraptured by an extremely beautiful scene.The story is set in motion when an aging woman named Arlette dies, leaving behind an inheritance to a mysterious woman named Clara Pickle. Arlette's step-granddaughter Betty is due the money should Clara not be found within a suitable amount of time. Instead of Betty waiting out the time and collecting her inheritance, she decides to go on an adventure to find the recipient of the will. \n\nShe was here.She was here.Her life had finally begun.\n\nNow we're at the point where I'd normally say : adventures ensue. In the case of Before I Met You, I might have to word things differently. For the best adventure is not focused around Betty, even though it is her mystery to solve. All of the excitement comes from finding out about Arlette's past. The reader is hurled back in time to the 1920's as we get the pieces of Arlette's life which were unknown to the people who knew her best at the time of her death.In the case of many books told from two viewpoints in two different time periods, there's always one viewpoint which seems to stand out as stronger than the other. At first, I would have sworn that Betty's tale would be far more fascinating. She was on her own in a new city, she had a handsome and mysterious market man take an interest in her, and she had also become a nanny for a big name musician. And while that was all well and good, Betty's story was merely the catalyst for us to find out about all things Arlette. I never really warmed up to Betty or her cares. Betty's potential musician love interest was meh. I only liked Betty's part of the story when John was in it because he was quite yummy.Arlette stole the show. Her story captivated me. I could imagine the vividly painted picture of 1920's London, with the music and the frolicking (yes, dammit, people frolicked!) and the dancing. This was not a prohibition tale, for the atmosphere was more open in London during the time period than it was in the states. I fell in love with Godfrey, the charming musician who Arlette couldn't stay away from. This was a time where inter-racial romance was not widely accepted, except for in the clubs and dance halls, where it was all about living life to the fullest. Arlette found herself wondering if she should buck the rules in order to follow her heart, or if she should stick with the man who would be easier to have a life with.\n\nHere she was, torn between the man who kept her safe and the man who made her feel mad with wanting.\n\nSo how does Arlette's story tie in to the unknown Clara Pickle? Well now, I can't tell you that. The book is about following Betty on her journey to find out who Clara is. By the time we get there, I felt like I'd been put through the ringer. My little heart was palpitating like crazy when the pieces finally started to come together.This was my first book by Lisa Jewell but it will certainly not be my last. This woman can write passages which make me want to reach into the pages of the book and see the images for myself, which is so wonderful to experience. If you've read and loved Jojo Moyes (Me Before You, The Girl You Left Behind, etc.) and like books which bring together the past and present, this is going to be one you won't want to miss."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8840861-stephanie", "userReview": "I'm the only person on Goodreads so far to give this book one star. I have read all of Lisa Jewell's other books and thoroughly enjoyed them. But I just didn't care about this one. The writing was formulaic, you knew exactly what was going to happen, the characters were one dimensional and stereotypical, and overall it was rather boring.

The result was much too twee for me and also littered with silly and avoidable inaccuracies. Of these, for me, the worst was on page 430: \"a big, empty house on a cliff, with distant tantalising views towards the white cliffs of Dover\" . The house was in Guernsey, Dover is over 200 miles away! And if distance and the earth's curvature were not a big enough obstacle, the Cherbourg Peninsula in between the two would certainly block the view.

This book did not disappoint. Well-written, vivid and at once warm and funny and poignant and moving. It\u2019s a more mature read than some of Lisa\u2019s earlier novels \u2013 even with a relatively young heroine, it is less \u2018chicklit\u2019 in feel and deals with some serious rather than frivolous themes.I especially enjoyed the dual points of view explored in the book \u2013 of Arlette, a young woman in 1920s London, and her step-granddaughter Betty, in 1990s London. There are wonderful parallels and also juxtaposition of the women\u2019s experiences that made for a compelling and powerful read. The characters are multi-faceted and realistic and likeable, and I was rather sad by the end of the book that their story had come to an end.For me, the best part of this book is the sense of place that the author creates. I love the island of Guernsey, so I enjoyed the descriptions of that setting, but it is London that really comes alive on the pages. Having read this book soon after finishing The Paris Wife, which depicts 1920s Paris, I found myself drawing parallels and enjoying the glimpse of life in bohemian London during that era. I think the author does a marvellous job of capturing the heart of London \u2013 Soho \u2013 without over-romanticising it. Take the following extract:All she knew was that the day was dying and the night was giving birth to itself, and there was something electric, something magnetic pulling her down Carnaby Street, past self-consciously crazy boutiques, past grimy pubs, through the throngs of tourists and teenage girls just like her, girls from somewhere else with overblown ideas of themselves, girls having a special treat with dowdy mothers and bored father, a day in town with an early lunch at Garfunkel\u2019s, overfilled bowls from the salad bar, tickets for a West End show tucked safely in Mum\u2019s bum-bag. It wasn\u2019t real. Even to Betty\u2019s immature, small-town eyes she could see through the fakery and the stage setting. There was something both murky and beguiling beyond this plastic street of Union Jacks and Beatles posters, something grimy and flittering.By the end of the book, I found myself wanting to visit London and the locations that feature in the story, so alive did the characters feel to me.Of course, at the heart of the story is romance \u2013 that of Arlette and of Betty \u2013 and indeed all sorts of relationship are explored in the novel. The result is a touching and memorable book that I recommend to any reader who enjoys romance."}, {"userName": "Tara Chevrestt", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2544368-tara-chevrestt", "userReview": "I bailed at 72%. I just really hated this book and its heroines. I will give it points for keeping me intrigued. After all, I kept plunging along even though I disliked its heroines. I kept thinking, \"Well, I want to know what happened\" even after I figured out who the mysterious Pickle lady was. It was so obvious.But the heroines just totally suck. While I don't expect them to be perfect..they must have flaws as we all do, can they possibly be more unlikable and STUPID?The modern-day girl--she constantly wants to remind us she \"gave up her life\" to care for an old lady. What does she want, a medal? She likes one guy but beds another. She can't wait for the old lady to die but then just sells the stuff she looked forward to acquiring. And the Soho bit...why the obsession with living in a place that is a \"kingdom of sirens and neon and filth and chaos and double yellow lines as far as the eye could see\"?To say I don't get her or like her is an understatement. And the past story... The heroine is likable until she lets a man destroy her life. She is so weak it's disgusting. I hate women who allow themselves to be victims, who don't fight back. I wanted to throw up. And the romance was so dry... I failed to FEEL the love they supposedly had. Granted, he speaks politely to her and says things like \"violent urge\" but it's so dry and his character is so flat when it should be passionate and the romance totally misses the mark.Just a total miss for me, but I dedicated four days to it so I'm posting my two cents.

If I say it reminded me of the best of JoJo Moyes, I mean it as a real compliment. Betty\u2019s 90s story \u2013 part love story, part investigation of the past \u2013 is interspersed with the story of Arlette and her life amid the bohemian set in the 1920s. The transitions are effortless, and both timeframes have a depth of detail that is absolutely captivating. Both Betty and Arlette are wonderfully drawn characters, and both stories \u2013 with their overlaps \u2013 are totally engrossing. It\u2019s a tribute to Lisa Jewell\u2019s writing that I never felt any wrench moving from one story to the other \u2013 either thread would have kept me hooked.

The story takes Betty into 1920s London and a world of Jazz clubs and intrigue she didn\u2019t think her grandmother was capable of.  Unfortunately the novelty of the plot is all this novel has going for it. With flat, unrealistic characters, improbable romances with little chemistry, and little that leaves you invested in the outcome. I had high hopes for this book, but it did not deliver.Obviously, as a Jewell book, this novel falls in the chick-lit, light side of literature. I didn\u2019t come to this book expecting it to be a great workth (10) of literature like The Luminaries (also released in the US on 10.13) but I did expect a little more from it. Chick-lit lives and dies on the lovability of its characters and the reality of the romances. Betty starts of realistic and her relationship with grandmother Arlette makes the first third of this novel live up to what I thought the whole novel would be.But. When Betty movies to London things just get weird. There\u2019s the somewhat irrelevant side story and rockstar Dom Jones. The tepid kind of sort of romance with John Brightly, and the odd assortment of neighbors that seem to be thrown in as a caricature of what people expect to read about city life that lack the description to make them believable.Then there\u2019s the flashback to Arlette\u2019s story, which held up a little longer than Betty\u2019s but eventually fell in the trap of \u201churry up and make a plot\u201d and the characters started to fall apart, with an almost unbelievable rape side story that really caused the whole thing to take a strange (and confusing) turn.The writing is done well and there are some chapters that make things interesting, but overall I finished the story more grateful it was over than excited about the outcome."}, {"userName": "Cleo Bannister", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3162627-cleo-bannister", "userReview": "Before I Met You is written in my favourite style, it is set in dual time-periods. Betty is in her early twenties in the 1990's when following the death of her Step-Grandmother Arlette she moves from Guernsey to Soho to trace the mysterious Clara Pickle who has been left a bequest in Arlette's will. The family have no idea who Clara Pickle is, no-one has ever heard her mentioned and as far as they know Arlette spent her whole life in Guernsey.Lisa Jewell's writing drew me into the story immediately with the balance between Betty and Arlette's story handled well. The references to the early nineties were plentiful, l such as the status symbol of a mobile phone and the lack of anyone else with one to text, will be familiar to those of us who were there but I have to confess Arlette's story set in the 1920's was what had me hooked. Arlette had befriended an artist and some jazz musicians exploring in the time period where the social lives of well-connected young women were opening up to all sorts of new possibilities.This is a story of two young women each making their way in the world for the first time without their families both have their fair share of adventures, misunderstandings and friendships.

It's about two women - Betty in the mid 1990s and Arlette in the 1920s. So far so good. Betty nurses her step-grandmother , Arlette, for the last few years of her life in an isolated house in Guernsey. When the old lady dies Betty finds she's been left a fur coat and one thousand pounds and she must track down a lady called Clara Pickle to whom the bulk of Arlette's estate has been left. She has a year to do this and if she fails she gets the money and property which would have gone to the mysterious Clara.I actually quite liked Betty as a character. She starts out with a quest which it is in her interests to fail but she is determined to track Clara down and tell her of her inheritance. The story alternates between Betty and Arlette but it could almost have been told from Betty's point of view only. As it is the reader is mainly a few steps ahead of Betty in her attempts to track down Clara. I liked Lisa Jewell's writing style and found Betty an interesting character. I was much less interested in Arlette and I also felt that first two hundred pages could probably have been compressed into fifty leaving the salient facts to come out as the story progressed.I enjoyed the last third of the book and found the various people Betty came across while living in London well drawn and interesting. I'm not sure I shall be looking for other books by this author but I can understand why she is popular.

When Arlette has a stroke and the develops Alzheimer's, Betty's parents can't cope and move out, but Betty stays, becoming Arlette's caregiver for several years. Upon Arlette's death, the will mentions a beneficiary none of the family have ever heard of, Clara Pickle, and Betty sets off to London on a search that will take her places she never imagined.The story goes back and forth between Betty's search for Arlette's story and Clara, and Arlette's story in the years from 1919 to 1921 in London. Arlette's London is a London of fashion, music, parties, art, and love. From Liberty's to jazz clubs, parties with black jazz musicians, sitting for portraits, living a life full of happiness to heartbreak and tragedy, this is a life you won't forget. And Betty too, finds a life in London, from working in a burger joint, to mixing with rock stars, antique dealers, and others looking to make a life for themselves.This is a story of London, of a particular bubble of time in the years just after World War I, and of learning the stories of those we love.

This one is perhaps a little more hip, less gothic than Morton's tales. The characters in both time periods are fun - young women leaving home for the first time and looking for adventure in the big city. There are many parallels between the 2 women and the 2 eras, showcasing just how hip and happening the '20's were, what a free time that was for women. They live in the same neighborhood - Soho - 70 years apart, one of them enmeshed in the exciting world of jazz musicians and nightclubs, the other with pop stars. Both are free-spirited and independent, but one is wiser to the world around her, less naive, making better choices.

On the one hand, she was mature and sensible, but on the other, she used terrible judgement and was incredibly naive. I quite liked Arlette until she revealed that she hated her son, for the crime of being a boy! She had some serious issues, and when the source of those issues was finally revealed, it just didn't add up.

I didn't warm to either main character, nor did I understand them. Additionally, the storyline became a little predictable. Although I typically love those books that see-saw back and forth through time, this one fell flat: the sort of literary equivalent of a bottle of soda left uncapped for a day."}, {"userName": "Poppy fairy ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18322003-poppy-fairy", "userReview": "A marvellously written novel.

Betty\u2019s grandmother has died and she has left some inheritance to a woman no one knows. She finds out information about her grandmother along the way that surprises her. The book is told in two year zones, one is in the 1920\u2019s, it is Arlette\u2019s story (Betty\u2019s grandmother) and the other is set in the 1990\u2019s and is Betty\u2019s story of trying to find the mystery benefactor of the will in London. I really enjoyed this book and loved turning the pages to see what would happen next in Arlette and Betty\u2019s stories."}, {"userName": "Helena Wildsmith", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28241958-helena-wildsmith", "userReview": "This proved to be a fantastic holiday read! Engrossing, sweet and very moving, I loved this just as I have loved everything else I have read by Lisa Jewell."}], "description": "After her grandmother Arlette's death, Betty is finally ready to begin her life. She had forfeited university, parties, boyfriends, summer jobs - all the usual preoccupations of a woman her age - in order to care for Arlette in their dilapidated, albeit charming home on the English island of Guernsey. Her will included a beneficiary unknown to Betty and her family, a woman named Clara Pickle who presumably could be found at a London address. Now, having landed on a rather shabby street corner in '90s Soho, Betty is determined to find the mysterious Clara. She's ready for whatever life has to throw her way. Or so she thinks . . . In 1920s bohemian London, Arlette De La Mare is starting her new life in a time of postwar change. Beautiful and charismatic, she is soon drawn into the hedonistic world of the Bright Young People. But two years after her arrival in London, tragedy strikes and she flees back to her childhood home and remains there for the rest of her life. As Betty navigates the ups and downs of city life and begins working as a nanny for a rock star tabloid magnet, her search for Clara leads her to a man - a stranger to Betty, but someone who meant the world to her grandmother. Will the secrets of Arlette's past help Betty find her own way to happiness in the present? A rich detective story and a captivating look at London then and now, \"Before I Met You\" is an unforgettable novel about two very different women, separated by seventy years, but united by big hearts and even bigger dreams.", "title": "Before I Met You", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15721976-before-i-met-you", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1342381606l/15721976.jpg", "reviews": 414, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/93504.Lisa_Jewell", "name": "Lisa Jewell"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15721976-before-i-met-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17925090-before-i-met-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17571749-before-i-met-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17307537-before-i-met-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23080581-before-i-met-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18764826-the-house-we-grew-up-in", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30753651-i-found-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34806691-then-she-was-gone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276357-the-girls-in-the-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/923045.Ralph_s_Party", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
