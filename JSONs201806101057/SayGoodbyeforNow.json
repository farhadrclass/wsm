While the summary for the book focuses on the relationship between Dr. Lucy and Calvin, I felt the main character was actually Pete Solomon, who has become my favorite adolescent character in fiction today. Pete is such a kind and caring individual whose story is heart-breaking; I was rooting for him the entire book and was so thankful that he met Dr. Lucy. The story opens in 1959 in a small West Texas town. Dr. Lucy has lived on her own for a long time and has become very comfortable with her solitary lifestyle. Pete finds a wounded wolf-dog on the side of the road and eventually ends up on Dr. Lucy\u2019s doorstep seeking treatment for the poor animal. On his way to Dr. Lucy\u2019s house, Pete befriends an African-American boy named Justin. Numerous town residents including Pete\u2019s horrible father harass Pete for befriending Justin. Pete\u2019s visit to Dr. Lucy and his friendship with Justin set off a chain of events that will change all of their lives forever. Hyde's characters are carefully crafted, and the protagonists are exactly the type of people I would enjoy getting to know. Their relationships evolve authentically, and Dr. Lucy and Pete develop a beautiful connection with each other, as do Dr. Lucy and Calvin, Justin\u2019s father. Racial tensions in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s in the South frequently ran high, and Hyde realistically portrays this issue. My one small quibble was the novel\u2019s resolution was wrapped up a little too quickly.This was my first time to read a book by Catherine Ryan Hyde, and I cannot wait to read some more. Years ago I saw the movie Pay it Forward and thoroughly enjoyed it. Until I picked up Say Goodbye For Now to actually read it, I didn\u2019t realize she had written the book that movie was based on. I have some catching up to do with regard to her numerous books!I highly recommend this heartbreaking but redemptive tale. Plan to have plenty of Kleenex nearby when you read it. Thanks to TLC Book Tours and the publisher for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Carole (Carole's Random Life in Books)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5892196-carole-carole-s-random-life-in-books", "userReview": "This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life in Books.I enjoyed this book. I really thought that this was going to be a book about a dog based on the cover. I obviously did not read the book's summary prior to starting this audiobook. There is a dog in the book but that dog is really not the main focus of the story. This was a story about race, love, and what really makes up a family. I am so glad that I stumbled upon this wonderful story.This book is told from two points of view. Dr. Lucy takes care of animals and the occasional human that comes to her for help. She lives a rather isolated life on her ranch and likes it that way. Pete is a 12 year old boy that happens upon a wounded dog laying on the side of the road and feels compelled to help. Pete finds help for the dog in Dr. Lucy and so much more.The characters in this book were wonderful and they all had their own complex story to tell. Dr. Lucy has been through a lot. The book is set in a time where people do not want to take a female doctor seriously so Lucy uses her skills to help animals. Pete has had a lot to deal with in his short life. Despite the way he is treated, he is still such a good kid and works hard to do what he feels is right. Justin and his father, Calvin, are new in town. The town has not been welcoming to them and has treated them poorly because of the fact that they are African American.I loved the way that the relationships between these characters developed. If the rest of the world would simply go away, these four people would be very happy. Pete and Justin have so much in common and I loved watching their friendship progress. Lucy goes from being alone most of the time to have a real connection to Pete, Justin, and Calvin. Everything about their interactions seemed natural and it made me very angry that the local citizens did everything they could to not allow any of the connections to exist.The narrators both did a great job with this story. I really do enjoy it when audiobooks utilize multiple narrators. Nick Podehl did a great job with Pete's point of view which was no small task since the character is a 12 year old boy. Teri Schnaubelt voices the parts that were told from Dr. Lucy's point of view. Both narrators were able to bring a lot of emotion into the story telling and were very pleasant to listen to for long periods of time. I would not hesitate to listen to either of these narrators again in the future.I would recommend this book to others. This was a very well told story that really care about the characters. This was the first book by Catherine Ryan Hyde that I have read but I wouldn't hesitate to read more of her work in the future.Initial ThoughtsI thought that this was going to be a book about a dog. I obviously didn't read the blurb about the book before reading it probably because I was distracted by the pretty dog on the cover. There is a dog in the book. A wolf-dog but the dog isn't the main point of the book. This book is about race, love, and what makes a family. The narrators did a good job with the story.

Broken out in three parts from 1959 to 1967,  a reminder of the changing laws of our country; however, it may not always change the hearts and minds of the people. From civil rights, segregation, a divide, to the overturning of bans on interracial marriage. The patience to wait, while protecting those we love. Timing.  Texas 1959 Dr. Lucy (Lucille Armstrong) is a regular doctor, not a veterinarian, yet she takes in animals and lost souls. She lives in a remote area, a southern small town. Some may think she is eccentric  and cold-hearted. She is strong and outspoken. She lives in a time when there were not very many women doctors. She likes the solitude and prefers the company of animals versus humans. She has her own painful past. She went to medical school and her life did not go as planned. Now she prefers to shut herself off from others.  Many of Lucy\u2019s patients never leave, once they cross through her door. She has sixteen dogs, eleven horses, a pig, and an owl. Soon she will take in yet another animal, and three strangers under her wing while trying to keep the law away from her front door. Pete Solomon,  age twelve, liked dogs provided they were healthy and alive. However, when he sees a wounded large dog along the highway, he had to help. Of course, his friend Jack is more interested in fishing than a helpless stray dog. This dog is a cross between a wolf and a dog. The dog seemed to listen and his life depended on Pete. Without Jack\u2019s help, Pete gets the dog in a wagon and earns its trust, to a \u201cso called\u201d vet. They are not nice and inform they do not treat wild animals. However, someone gives him a tip. There is a Dr. Lucy which may help. After all, everything and everyone wants to live. It is called \"survival.\" Little does Pete, his soon to be loyal friend Prince (dog) and Dr. Lucy know --how they will become connected for years to come. Pete also has his own pain, too much for a boy of his age to bear. An abusive father. No mother. Dr. Lucy is like no one he has ever met. He wishes he could remain with her, the animals and his new wolf-dog friend, Prince, while he heals. He never wants to leave. (he is an old soul). He also meets another boy his age, Justin Bell  (African American) and they become instant friends. Justine has a great heart and he likes this new friend and ditches his old selfish friend, Jack.However, soon Justine and Pete learn the world of grownups are not so nice. People do not like this newfound friendship. Shortly, thereafter Pete\u2019s dad discovers this friendship and beats him for being gone (while looking after the stray dog at Dr. Lucy\u2019s house\u2014he keeps a secret), and second, for walking in public with his new friend, Justine down the highway.Hurt, and down on his luck,  Pete decides to return to Dr. Lucy\u2019s house. He cannot go on like this. He has to keep his visits a secret as well as his friendship with Justine. On his way, he discovers Justin badly beaten on the side of the road. He immediately goes to his rescue. Justine says he cannot go to the hospital or police. He has been warned. He has no one to turn to but Dr. Lucy. She immediately takes both boys under her wing, no questions asked. A woman who thought she liked living alone, cut off from the world. She is their protector, a rescuer; even when she thought there was no feeling left in her. When she calls the dad, Calvin to let him know of his son\u2019s issues, she soon discovers he is also a caring soul and is drawn to his kindness for his son. Calvin\u2019s wife died years earlier and he raises his son with love, and compassion; unlike Pete\u2019s dad. Pete sees this bond between father and son, and wonders why his life is so different.Yet despite the couple's strong attraction,  the town and those around them (outside of Lucy, Calvin, Justine, and Pete), are unkind. From racial tension and injustice. The boys learn the adult world is quite cruel and full of hatred. Soon there is more violence and Dr. Lucy once again is there to help. The couple soon falls in love; however, they know they cannot have a future or act upon their feelings until the laws change. After all, this is Texas in 1959. Patience.  In addition, Pete\u2019s father and the people in the town are violently against interracial friendship and relationships. Pete is around some great new role models; however, he still has to face his own father. Why should a child\u2019s life be so difficult?  He has the weight of the world on his shoulders. With the special love of strangers,  Pete now has a family, as well as the others. Each has hope. Strong bonds are formed. Both human and animals. However, each one may have to say \"goodbye for now\" in hopes they will meet again. Things are not always so simple and straightforward. Great themes and parallels here.

Calvin, a man of wisdom and patience, and a role model for his son Justin. Hyde illuminates  racial tensions, which still exist in our country today, while at the same time a perfect example of how small acts of faith can make big inroads to acceptance.

Losses can be restored. \"Things can turn out, long after you had accepted they never would.\" When you are willing to do what\u2019s best for others. Putting our own feelings aside.  Enjoyed the tie in, with the Supreme Court ruling Loving vs. Virginia case. A timely story even in today\u2019s world of racial injustice, evil, and violence. Plus our world of \"need it now.\" Rushing, immediate gratification. We all need a lesson in patience and waiting. (Myself included). Just finished Waiting for Wonder: Learning to Live on God's Timeline A great example of waiting! In SAY GOODBYE FOR NOW, there is unwavering love, kindness, faith, and caring. Sometimes things or people we meet, may not be entirely random nor accidental encounters. Life knows exactly what it is doing.

I felt as though I personally knew Pete, Dr Lucy, Calvin & Justin. I thought this was going to be mostly about a dog, and though that's what brings these unlikely friends together, the dog is not central to the story. It's about being a good friend, helping someone, and doing the right thing. It's also about unfairness & cruelty. I was in tears after a certain hospital scene.

I won a copy of Say Goodbye For Now from the author and was so exited as I\u2019ve had several of her books in my TBR and hadn\u2019t gotten around to them before now. I\u2019m kicking myself now that I waited this long to read one of Ryan Hyde\u2019s novels and I\u2019m vowing here and now to read some of her other work in the new year. This book totally hit the spot and was just the type of feel good read that I was craving.It\u2019s 1959 in small town Texas and though Lucy and Pete have both lived there for years, they haven\u2019t crossed paths before. Lucy is a doctor who quit practicing after many people had objections to being treated by a woman. She\u2019s distant and isolated, both physically and emotionally and surrounds herself with stray animals no one else wants. Pete is the sweetest kid and when he finds a dog hurt in the side of the highway he takes it to Dr. Lucy for help. Justin and Calvin are father and son and new to town and the young boys become fast friends. These four have no idea how their chance encounters will shape and define their lives in the future, but they all have lessons to learn and things to teach each other.Ryan Hyde sure knows how to write a page turner, I couldn\u2019t wait to see how this story would turn out. She wove a story that was both beautifully tender and brimming with heavy issues, but she managed to convey a strong message without leaving me feeling like I had read something emotionally draining. There is Lucy who is dealing with the loss of her son and husband as well as sexism, Pete who is an abused child, and Justin and Calvin who are African American in the fifties, enough said there. As these four struggle with their own issues, they manage to find solace in each other and it was a truly gorgeous thing to witness.This was an effortless read, the chapters alternate between Dr. Lucy\u2019s point of view and Pete\u2019s. The bulk of the story is told within the first few months the four meet, then the last half spans the course of eight years. I feel in love with all four of them, but Pete especially left a mark on my heart, he is a special kid who is wise beyond his years. This is begging to be picked for a book club read, there is so much to discuss and explore. Also, if you\u2019re an animal lover there are some really great moments here with all kinds of creatures."}, {"userName": "Ezinwanyi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4386752-ezinwanyi", "userReview": "This story grazes upon on a number of sensitive subjects. There was the issue of a female doctor, Lucille \u201cLucy\u201d Armstrong, whose husband left her as her professional standing exceeded his. In addition, her adolescent son resented her because of her work schedule. Adding insult to injury, Dr. Armstrong was lacking in respectable patients as many people in the rural area of Texas refused to be treated by a woman. Then author also deals with the issue of child abuse and abandonment as the reader was introduced to the life of twelve-year-old Pete Solomon. When Pete took pity on an injured wolf dog and got help from a ten-year-old black boy Justin Bell to carry the dog to Dr. Lucy, the author introduced animal abuse, racism and hate crimes into the story.I enjoyed how the author weaved the story together although I felt she didn\u2019t really delve deep into any of those issues. It was enough for the reader to consider each character\u2019s plight and how they dealt with their lot in life. These four people were outcasts or not part of the acceptable society\u2019s circle, but they found in each other an anchor. Many times, people say blood is thicker than water, but many families are \u201cchosen\u201d or \u201cformed\u201d by necessity. This was one of those times that a makeshift family provided love, acceptance, support and encouragement in a situation where it was badly needed.Once I started this book, I didn\u2019t put it down. It wasn\u2019t exactly tear inducing but there was a small dose of angsty. I definitely had an emotional connection to the characters because I felt bad for Pete, Justin and for Calvin and Lucy as a couple. That journey to lasting love certainly touched me. There were different kinds of love expressed in this book and it made up for the pain and hatred shown to the characters. There was an encouraging evolution in this book that gave me hope for society today.I didn\u2019t give this book a five-star rating because while the author did a great job developing the heroine Lucy as well as Pete, but I had a surface grasp on Justine, his father Calvin and Pete\u2019s father. I would have liked more information regarding Pete\u2019s father, especially from his own perspective. Still, this book was really a moving and poignant read.*Special Thanks to Lake Union Publishing via Netgalley for the e-book given in exchange for an honest review.\""}, {"userName": "Deanna Sletten", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1314150-deanna-sletten", "userReview": "Four lonely people find each other in a small, Texas town in the stifling time-period of 1959. When Pete finds a hurt dog/wolf on the side of the road, he takes the animal to Dr. Lucy, who lives alone on a small ranch and cares for injured and unwanted animals. Reluctantly, she helps the dog, and soon, her life becomes complicated as she becomes involved in the lives of Pete, his new friend, Justin, and then Justin\u2019s father, Calvin. Normally, this would be a good thing, but in 1959, a white woman befriending an African American man and his son was not very well accepted. And the people of the town make their feelings loud and clear.Author Catherine Ryan Hyde once again brings together a unique cast of characters who aren\u2019t looking for anything or anyone to change their lives and then slowly find each other and can\u2019t help but grow close. She creates perfectly flawed characters who sneak into your heart and make you care about them. And she takes on a tough topic with grace and candor.

The subject matters dealt in this book are certainly hard-hitting and made me sick in the stomach at times, but this is undeniably one of the thought-provoking books that I read this year.The story focuses on the main two characters, Pete and Dr. Lucy and they respectively have their own issues, Pete with his abusive father and Dr. Lucy with a dark past of having divorced and lost her son to pneumonia; she secludes herself away from others and avoids communication ever since, making a living by treating seedy patients who seemingly have done something illegal without asking any questions as opposed to other doctors.She was content with her life and assumed she'd continue living that way, but from the moment Pete appears at her doorstep with an injured wolf dog for a treatment, their paths collide and their lives start to take an unexpected direction.As the story is set in 1959, it is peppered with the issues of prejudice and racism. Pete is an incredibly nice boy with an innocent, right mind and can tell right from wrong. Sadly, though, others can't. His best friend abandoned the wolf dog just because it seemed wild, so does the vet to whom Pete brought the wolf dog first. Based on its appearance, they refuse to get involved which literally saddened me and frustrated me.Then we have another nice African American boy, Justin, who recently moved to the town. Pete and Justin get to know each other through the wolf dog but the adults, especially those on Pete's side are not having it; his father whipped (yes, whipped) Pete for just walking side by side with Justin, saying that Justin doesn't belong to this community and is NOT the right kind to hang out with.Such prejudice and sickening events happen an awful a lot in this book, but through the eyes of Pete and his friendship with Justin, this book tells us how base and mean we can be when we let our prejudice get the better of us. Both Pete and Justin are such nice boys that I couldn't help rooting for them, hoping others - especially adults - to come to their senses and accept what they have been\u00a0doing was wrong.But at the same time, this is also a story of a young boy standing up for his friend and sticking to his beliefs. Pete knows what he has been doing would never be accepted by his father and is afraid of what severe punishments that'd bring to him, but his conscience tells him to stand up and say \"NO\" to his father once and for all.Pete's transition from a meek boy to a strong, courageous one is a delight to read. It is no doubt one of the heart-warming scenes in this book.The change Dr. Lucy goes through is also nicely written. Like I mentioned earlier, she used to be closed-off and standoffish. She kind of seemed a bit distant at the beginning of the book, but as she gets involved with Pete and Justin, she gets emotionally attached to them and goes back to her true self.Although I found the spark of attraction with Justin's father, Calvin (quite\u00a0insta-lovey) a bit rushed and unrealistic, the progression from now onwards is rather slow yet nice, and this romance plays an integral part in the latter part and her perseverance leads us to a glorious, delightful ending.It was quite a surprise when I found that this story spans over as long as 8 years. This was not what I was expecting from this book, it literally took me surprise both on the direction this book takes and how long it spans over.Eventually, sad things happen and then Pete and Justin, and Dr. Lucy and Calvin, have to part ways. Now, this is one of the most gut-wrenching scenes in the book and I was literally frustrated by the injustice they have to go through. They haven't done anything wrong, but because of the circumstances, they have to resort to \"saying goodbye for now.\"\u00a0But I was expecting their separation to be a short term, I wasn't expecting it to be this long term.But then again, it highlights the element of perseverance, trust, and royalty. They literally waited until the world catches up with them and recognizes the neglect of basic human rights.The ending was quite therapeutic to read; Dr. Lucy's delight and surprise were heartfelt, making the scene really moving and touching.I really enjoyed listening to this book and how the main two characters develop themselves as the plot goes.Although I was mildly disappointed by the wolf dog not being featured as much as I expected, but considering how he connects those four individuals' paths, I think the author did a great job of weaving this beautiful, profoundly story by tactfully using the wolf dog as a key character that brings the story together.The narrators did an amazing job; both of them. Their performance was stellar and kept me engaged throughout. Although I was a bit confused by the change of tone of Dr. Lucy's voice upon the narrator change, other than that, their performance was beyond reproach. I highly recommend this audiobook. it was such a delight to listen to and I think many readers will enjoy this.I gave this book 4.5 out of 5 stars.N0te: As I briefly mentioned, this book's one of the subject matters is child abuse. There is a scene that was so hard-hitting for me, which literally made me clench my teeth, so if you are sensitive to such things, you might want to be cafeful when you ever decide to pick this up."}, {"userName": "Jenny Whetzel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18279274-jenny-whetzel", "userReview": "I have only read a couple books by this author but know that I want to keep reading more.

I have previously read another book by Catherine Ryan Hyde, \"Worthy,\" and although I adored it as well, I had no idea this one would be so much better.One early summer day Pete and his friend are headed out fishing. Along the way, they run into a large dog alongside the road who has been hit. Pete immediately wants to help the dog, because that's just the type of kid he is, while his friend decides to go ahead fishing. It takes Pete all day to rescue this dog. The town vet refuses to treat him since he is part wolf so he has to trek 4 miles out of town, wheeling the pup on a makeshift wagon, to seek out a recluse of a woman doctor who lives alone and rescues strays, both human and animal, from time to time. Pete's excursion changes his life. He meets Dr. Lucy and soon makes a new friend, Justin, whom he immediately likes after he quizzes him on whether he would help an injured animal or go fishing and Justin chooses the animal. The only problem if that Justin is black and it's Texas, 1959. While this is not an issue for Pete or Dr. Lucy, it is for the rest of the town and Dr. Lucy, who soon becomes attached not only to Pete and Justin, but to Justin's father, Calvin, soon learns what lengths people will go to make sure people \"stick to their own kind.\"This is a beautiful book about friendship and family. The dog actually mirrors Dr. Lucy in that he apparently has lived alone most of his life and is afraid to let people in. Even once he heals and Pete releases him back into the wild, he knows Pete loves him dearly and he takes it upon himself to continue to keep an eye on the boy from the fringes and make sure Pete is safe. This book covers a long time period and we get to see both the people and the rescued dog grow old both together and apart. Hyde does a wonderful job of showing how even in 1959, some didn't see the world as strictly black and white and also how people can make chose to make their own families despite what society dictates. I think this is a perfect book for this time of year. It's touching yet it sparks thought. It's also pretty ugly at times and it reaffirms my belief that sometimes the scariest monsters in the world are actually human beings. If you love great storytelling and the bond between people and their pets, please consider reading this book. I doubt you'll regret it!"}, {"userName": "Mrs Mommy Booknerd http://mrsmommybooknerd.blogspot.com", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4827402-mrs-mommy-booknerd-http-mrsmommybooknerd-blogspot-com", "userReview": "Another brilliant book by a very talented writer that keeps giving us stories that we cannot put down!

And yet, the antiquated views on race relations that were common in those times make it feel further away than it was. (Or, even sadder, that some still hold those views. But I digress.)This is the sort of book that pulls you into another time while making you happy that those times are (somewhat, anyway, we're learning) in the past. A boy finds an injured dog, a friend, and a new family, the story developing slowly, with grace. Major characters are well developed, while minor characters are drawn well enough to make them believable, with no excessive details that bore. A group of broken people - and animals - find each other and heal together, stronger for knowing each other."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13116274-jan", "userReview": "Wow this was a wonderful book! It was a thoughtful, heartwarming story that tackled the difficult subject of racial prejudice in the late 1950\u2019s. Hyde handled the subject well and with a lot of dignity.

I enjoyed watching Dr. Lucy\u2019s guarded heart open up to much needed healing. With the addition of Calvin and his son Joseph we have four hurt and oppressed human beings who find love and acceptance as they struggle with the hate and prejudice of this small community.

This story has such a lyrical, melancholy feel to it. The writing is so descriptive, every moment I felt I was there with Dr. Lucy as she took care of the gunshot wound of a thief, I was there as Pete's father berated him, and when Pete finds Justin after he gets beaten within an inch of his life, and for the tender, budding relationship between Calvin and Lucy. The writing had the feel of Kent Haruf, who has written so many great stories taking place in the west.As a reader and dog lover, the cover seeks to be read. The eyes of the dog, that we come to know as Prince in the story, half dog, half wolf, you want to know the story behind those eyes.The story starts in 1959, in a small Texas town. It's not often that adult fiction has a main character who is twelve years old, but Ms. Hyde has captured the voice of Pete, who is a respectful kid, but whose father doesn't appreciate him and is even cruel to Pete. Dr. Lucy is a loner and the only female doctor in town, but she prefers to take care of sick and injured animals, especially after the town's people don't take a female doctor seriously. Her farm is filled with horses, dogs, a pig, and even an owl. Pete meets Dr. Lucy when he finds the wolf/dog injured on the side of the road. Pete and Justin become unlikely friends in this unforgiving town, while Justin's father Calvin and Dr. Lucy, share a bond of loneliness, which like a flower in the dry Texas field blossoms after a summer shower.The story takes place in a simpler time, but the relationships between the characters are more difficult in some ways. Male and female, black and white, human and animal, adult and child. While there is a feeling of melancholy, the story is a beautifully moving one and is in no way sad. You will find yourself rooting for Lucy, Pete, Calvin and Justin Bell. Say Goodbye for now is a powerful story that will tug at your heartstrings.https://baerbooks.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47040064-diana", "userReview": "It is a rare book that captures the essence of a critical period in history in a way that resonates today. As I reflected on the impact of Say Goodbye for Now, I came to see that for me, and perhaps for anyone disheartened by the current unrest in our country, this is a story about finding a way to carve out, and protect, a space for possibility while living in a seemingly impossible time.Just as this novel was delving into the transformational power of woundedness, millions of the walking wounded were marching in cities across our nation. The theme of being a safe haven for others, as demonstrated by Dr. Lucy, Pete, and even the wolf hybrid, Prince, is as relevant in this day and age as it was during the Civil Rights Era.While wrestling with themes of injustice, isolation, fear, friendship, goodness, and difficult choices, Dr. Lucy, Calvin, Justin, Pete, and Prince learn to trust, to connect, and to keep a space open for the potential of restoration.\"It felt like a confidence in things. The normally empty chest space seemed to surge with the sudden notion that losses can be restored -- at least some of the time. That things can turn out, long after you had accepted that they never could.\"If, like me, you find yourself entering 2017 with some trepidation, this could be one of the most important books you read this year. I know it has deeply impacted me. After reading Say Goodbye for Now twice over the past few weeks, I find myself better equipped to deal with the losses associated with deferred hope.*I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2582387-marvin", "userReview": "I liked this in spite of myself. It's a sappy story told without much creativity or style, the characters are cliched, and the dialogue is stiff and unbelievable. Yet for what it is, it works. The straightforward chronological narrative carries you along, and you quickly learn to care for the characters: a crusty female doctor with a hidden heart of gold living on an isolated ranch in Texas, caring for a bunch of abandoned, damaged animals; a 12-year-old boy, also with a heart of gold, nearly perfect in every way except for his self-doubt; the wolf-dog he rescues after it's hit by a vehicle and takes to the doctor for healing; the 12-year-old African American boy he also rescues after a beating and, of course, also takes to the doctor for healing; and, finally, the African American boy's father. All of these characters, especially the last, help the doctor rediscover her heart, her ability to care for others in a world that has, and continues to, disappoint her. I guess I'm a sucker for stories, even if they're flawed, about good folks who struggle with how to relate to each other honestly and with integrity."}, {"userName": "Kari", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101554-kari", "userReview": "Say Goodbye for Now is a compelling and at times heart wrenching story. Initially set in 1959, it's the story of 4 people who find each other during unstable times and form strong bonds that sustain them through the ups and downs of the turbulent 60s. I found this book to be hard to read at times. Don't get me wrong, it was well written and the story is beautiful. What I found hard to read was how Calvin and Justin were treated just because of the color of their skin. Because of the time and town they lived in, there was no way Lucy and Calvin could be together. That was so heartbreaking. I'm not going to give away too much of the plot. This is a book you really need to experience for yourself. All through the book, I kept thinking of the saying: If you love something set it free, if it comes back it was meant to be. I just found that so relevant to this book. I'm a sucker for happy endings, so I was rooting for this little family of the heart.
