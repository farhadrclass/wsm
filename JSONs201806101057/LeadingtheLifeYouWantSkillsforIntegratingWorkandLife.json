The first half of the book was somewhat interesting. It contained 6 stories of high profile people such as Michelle Obama, Sheryl Sandberg and Bruce Springsteen. The stories highlighted the changes they made in their lives to integrate work and family. While I found them fascinating, there seemed to be holes in some of these stories. For example, Sheryl Sandberg said she works at home in the morning, works in the office from 9-5:30, then works again at home at night. As we finally put our kids to bed and look up to see the laundry, dishes and chores that need to be done, I'm wondering how that's possible without a full-time maid and chef. Her husband had a high-profile job as well so he couldn't do it either. It just didn't fit.However, I found that Michelle Obama's story gave actual tips on how to make your family a priority.The second half of the book I just didn't get at all."}, {"userName": "Rich", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65136057-rich", "userReview": "I found this book to be a bit disappointing and ended up speed reading through most of it. I felt that Stewart Friedman's other book, Total Leadership, was amazing. This is more of a complement/appendix to the prior book. One of the messages from his prior book on being an effective leader is to be a great storyteller. He leverages the first half of the book to walk through examples of 6 people (Tom Tierney, Sheryl Sandberg, Eric Greitens, Michelle Obama, Julie Foudy, and Bruce Springsteen) who have exemplified total leadership in the four areas (self, home, community, and work). The second half of the book has action items that you can take to help improve how you can: be real (act with authenticity)be whole (act with integrity)be innovative (act with creativity)"}, {"userName": "Susan Lauher", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/424178-susan-lauher", "userReview": "Great resource for coaches or for anyone looking to improve work/ life integration"}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12832115-greg", "userReview": "Is it really possible to live all domains of your life to the fullest? For several years, Stewart Friedman offers us this resounding answer: YES.In his latest book, Leading the Life You Want: Skills for Integrating Work and Life, Stew presented a very compelling argument that our life is not a zero-sum game. It is always possible for one to live his life in accordance with his values and aspirations.The first part of the book presented us the stories of six (6) remarkable persons who were able lead the life they want by having the right skills of total leadership: be real, be whole, and be innovative. These sets of skills were properly espoused by these persons in their respective domains of life such as work, family, community, and self (mind, body, and spirit).The second part of this work gave us several practical and very useful tips on how we can develop each of the skills in our life.Stew was able to produce a very compelling idea with the use of his superb writing skills. The book was very easy to understand and at the same time captivating. Moreover, not only that he narrated the respective stories of the six featured persons here but he did his analysis of each lives very clearly and vividly.Several reasons why one should read this book:You will learn that it is possible to live an integrated lifeLeading the life you want requires skills. Want to have these skills? Don't just read the book, practice what you will learn.You can share the wisdom from this book so you can help your colleagues lead their lives better.If you want to be a better leader, then you have to better lead yourself too.

The book was only okay overall, but a few of the overall points did sink in. Largely, the idea of integrating your life and not trying to segregate \"work\" from \"life\". Since having kids, I've always tried to keep a very firm dividing line between work and home. Living that way, I realize that it only magnifies the feeling that I'm somehow wasting the time I spend at work. It's not good. Instead, if you approach work as being part of your life, and working to get the important things out of it, it becomes so much more rewarding. For example, I want to volunteer more. Instead of viewing this as something outside of work that I need to make time for, I now work for a company that offers many opportunities to volunteer in the community. It's a bonus at work and in life."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28510596-diane", "userReview": "The book provides a refreshing look at the quest for work-life balance. Instead of looking at trade-offs, the author stresses creating harmony in four key areas (work/school, home/family, community, and mind-body-spirit) in one's life. As the author notes, \"Successful people make it their business to be conscious of what and who matter most.\" The author provides various activities to help a reader assess his/her personal values and to develop skills for being real, being whole, and being innovative. I also enjoyed reading examples of six prominent individuals on how they apply the principles of being real, whole, and innovative in their lives. I think this book can be a great source for anyone, especially those who want to make changes in their lives."}, {"userName": "Brad Feld", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7288218-brad-feld", "userReview": "While in Bora Bora, one of the books I read was Stewart Friedman\u2019s Leading the Life You Want: Skills for Integrating Work and Life.

The book is more about how to change your life along your goals. Maybe that is the way for work-life balance, but there are many practical limits to what high profile people can do and what everyday reader can do. The stories in the book are interesting, but I am not sure the points are convincing.I also dislike the fact that the author refers to his other book Total Leadership several times, and it feels like this book is an application of ideas in Total Leadership and you should read Total Leadership first, which I have not."}, {"userName": "Catherine Gillespie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39785846-catherine-gillespie", "userReview": "With an appealing title, best seller status, and glowing reviews from all sorts of respectable sources, I expected great things from Leading the Life You Want: Skills for Integrating Work and Life.However, to put it simply: if you have ever read anything on leadership, business, and work/life balance, you won\u2019t learn anything new from this book.

But does it really feel full\u2014or are you stretched too thin? Enter Stew Friedman, Wharton professor, adviser to leaders across the globe, and passionate advocate of replacing the misguided metaphor of \u201cwork/life balance\u201d with something more realistic and sustainable. If you\u2019re seeking \u201cbalance\u201d you\u2019ll never achieve it, argues Friedman. The idea that \u201cwork\u201d competes with \u201clife\u201d ignores the more nuanced reality of our humanity\u2014the interaction of four domains: work, home, community, and the private self. The goal is to create harmony among them instead of thinking only in terms of trade-offs. It can be done.Building on his national bestseller, Total Leadership, and on decades of research, teaching, and practice as both consultant and senior executive, Friedman identifies the critical skills for integrating work and the rest of life. He illustrates them through compelling original stories of these remarkable people:\u2022 former Bain & Company CEO and Bridgespan co-founder Tom Tierney\u2022 Facebook COO and bestselling author Sheryl Sandberg\u2022 nonprofit leader and US Navy SEAL Eric Greitens\u2022 US First Lady Michelle Obama\u2022 soccer champion-turned-broadcaster Julie Foudy\u2022 renowned artist Bruce SpringsteenEach of these admirable (though surely imperfect) people exemplifies a set of skills\u2014for being real, being whole, and being innovative\u2014that produce a sense of purpose, coherence, and optimism.Based on interviews and research, their stories paint a vivid picture of how six very different leaders use these skills to act with authenticity, integrity, and creativity\u2014and they prove that significant public success is accomplished not at the expense of the rest of life, but as the result of meaningful engagement in all its parts. With dozens of practical exercises for strengthening these skills, curated from the latest research in organizational psychology and related fields, this book will inspire you, inform you, and instruct you on how to take realistic steps now toward leading the life you truly want.", "title": "Leading the Life You Want: Skills for Integrating Work and Life", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23340775-leading-the-life-you-want", "average": 3.39, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428976162l/23340775.jpg", "reviews": 23, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/674341.Stewart_D_Friedman", "name": "Stewart D.
