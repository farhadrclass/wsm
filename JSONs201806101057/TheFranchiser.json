I adored the frenetic pace, the comedic chutzpah and cartwheeling craziness in the manner of Ishmael Reed or D. Keith Mano\u2019s Take Five. The language was serpentine, maximal and gushed out like golden fonts from a tyke\u2019s diaper (or nappy, if you\u2019re British, which you aren\u2019t, are you?) BUT. And here\u2019s a big but . . . I like big buts and I cannot lie. This exhaustive style, in today\u2019s hypertwitchy reading world, lends itself to the weary page-scan, the lazy skip-scan-skip until the dialogue kicks in or a paragraph break finally pops up from the descriptive shrubbery. So I think that\u2019s Elkin\u2019s downfall as a novelist: he\u2019s too damn sesquipedalian in this age of the decircumlocutious. But I thought the ride was a scream: Ben is a sublime comedic schmuck, a perverse inversion of the American Dream, and his adopted family of afflicted brothers and sisters tenderises the savage. BUT. There are moments of sexual wish-fulfilment (i.e. seventies retro stuff), a little tasteless satiric cruelty (killing off his cast of lovelies in ha-ha-disgusting ways), and that endless gush of words floods what would otherwise be a bitter and lean satire. Elkin\u2019s own troubles with MS are channelled through Ben in a detached but \u201crecognised\u201d way, i.e. he doesn\u2019t drown the problem in humorous abandon. But he leaves us too mired in his vast imaginative bog to touch a tangible emotion. I will read another Elkin. [P.S. This book has the ugliest cover Dalkey has ever designed!

Born from the sweat of immigrants, cut from the cloth of mass-produced materials, force fed The American Dream from an all-you-can-eat buffet. The Franchiser is about America told through a capitalistic insanity, a modern-day road novel about a sick man traversing a sick country during its bicentennial celebration, a man not only on a mission to acquire businesses--the golden arches, the dairy queens, the car washes--but have his voice heard in each of the 50 states, only to find himself losing meaning, losing himself. What makes this novel so brilliant is its language, especially Elkin's dialogue coming from the mouths of the morally unhinged, the ribald and ever so random moments of glorious madness. It is downright fucking hilarious at points, and terribly sad at its core. Case in point, his surrogate family made up of twins and triplets, and all of them stricken with carnivalesque illnesses (one born with her heart outside her lungs, and another born with rampant, uncontrollable racism), and of Flesh's MS, where his body betrays his senses, disallowing him any comfort in the modern luxuries of modern living, the tactile losing all its textures. This is a brilliant novel. Stanley Elkin is a genius and it's a shame we don't hear his name much in the literary circles of today.(advice from a hitchhiker)\"Get a normality. Live on the plains. Take a warm milk at bedtime. Be bored and find happiness. Grays and muds are the decorator colors of the good life. Don't you know anything? Speed kills and there's cholesterol in excitement.

Elkin's consummate style is sustained throughout. If you've read any of his other books, you'll want to read this one too. One character from another of his novels even makes a brief cameo! excerpt: He rises, intending to go to his room, when his eye is caught by the map on the big display board opposite the registration desk. The concentric hundred-mile circles make the states behind them a sort of target, twelve hundred miles of American head as seen through a sniperscope. He goes up to the map, to dartboard America, bull's-eyed, Ptolemaic-Ringgold. He examines it speculatively. And suddenly sees it not as a wheel of distances but of options. It's as if he hasn't seen it properly before. Though there are dozens of road maps in the glove compartment of his car, he has rarely referred to them. Not for a long while. Not since the Interstate made it possible to travel the country in great straight lines. Why, there are signs for Memphis and Tulsa and Chicago in St. Louis now. Signs for Boston and Washington, D.C. in the Bronx. Seen this way, in swaths of hundred-mile circles like shades in rainbows, he perceives loops of relationship. He is equidistant from the Atlantic Ocean, from the Gulf ofMexico and Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Centralia, Illinois. He could as easily be in Columbus, Ohio as in Petersburg, Virginia. New Orleans rings him, Covington, Kentucky, does. He is surrounded by place, by tiers of geography like bands of amphitheater. He is the center. If he were to leave now, striking out in any direction, northwest to Nashville, south to Panama City, Florida, it would make no difference. He could stand before other maps like this in other Travel Inns. Anywhere he went he would be the center. He would pull the center with him, the world rearranging itself about him like a woman smoothing her skirt, touching her hair."}, {"userName": "Cody", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48027559-cody", "userReview": "It\u2019s been too long now since I read this to give it a proper review.

No longer is the United States an \"are\" it has become an \"is\". Fueled by the efficiency of one size fits all retail America, driving through Dodge City is driving through Tallahassee is driving through Amarillo is driving through your town.Elkin's book \"The Franchiser\" captures the mid-life crisis of a consumer age, where comfort is found in the repetitive sameness of modern amenity and the ativism of unadulterated consumerism. In \"The Franchiser\", Elkin traps Ben Flesh in a familial version of this sameness with a collection of twins and triplets, his god-cousins, to whom he is bound by a death bed promise of the vig. Flesh translates his personal sense of duty to this unified mass of unrelated family into a personal conquest of the nation's highways and bi-ways as Flesh becomes a commanding officer in the war to spread uniformity to the masses through the purchase of franchise businesses. Flesh spends half an adulthood providing for and pleasing the god-cousins while he drives, alone and sullen, across the country checking on his fleet of franchises.In the midst of his travels, Flesh becomes symptomatic of multiple sclerosis. The man who spent his early years engulfed in the sounds and smells of suburbia, and all that its wage earners have to offer, suddenly has a terrifying internal short circuit of the senses. In large part, Flesh's MS focuses his attention to the vast gulf between himself and any real family.While the book is celebrated for its frenetic reference to the stalwarts of the consumer culture (it is, it seems, the economic companion to Robert Coover's 500 page pop culture pre-Wikipedia titled \"The Public Burning\" or a literary link to Tom Wait's lyrics to \"Step Right Up\"), many modern readers will struggle with the prose and the pacing. Still, \"The Franchiser\" is a good Polaroid of what we collectively once were when oil and inflation supplanted email and Facebook as a mis-mash of culture and national security."}, {"userName": "Rita", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990294-rita", "userReview": "I guess I don't need to read about another 1%er who helped make the united states the messed-up place it is today."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7014136-tom", "userReview": "A world of neon and numbing nuked food may make happy the many, but we're all the fool."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2053769-justin", "userReview": "A lightly ironic panegyric that seems the literary equivalet Road Runner #2, the stars and the radio towers, the highway your girlfriend, the magic powered bleakness, the weird giddiness that come from smoking too much fluorescence, etc. This is not surprising given both were written during the seventies. Plot revolves around one Ben Flesh, entrepeneur and 'franchiser' (or 'Franchisee' as Col.Sanders indignantly asserts at one point), one of the many invisible hands behind America's surburbanization. Book is uneven, though always carried along by the simple enjoyment of just reading Elkin's prose. The seemingly random changes between 1st and 3rd person was initially confusing(almost annoying), and over the long run just appeared unnecessary. This is not my favorite Elkin work, those being The Magic Kingdom and The Dick Gibson Show (Dick Gibson makes a brief appearance in The Franchiser), both of which rival (and appear as a precursor to) the manically exhaustive style and absurd black humor of David Foster Wallace. Still, the fight with Col.Sanders alone may make this book worth reading, and Elkin's descriptions of illness are fairly unparallel in my mind (though again, Magic Kingdom covers this terrain even more extensively). For those who have yet to read Elkin, go with the Dick Gibson Show. For others, this review is probably useless. In fact, I am having that kind of hollow-postmasturbatory self-loathing thing going on right now concerning my writing this review. I mean, why does anyone care what I think about this? Why I am I writing this?

Heck, Wal-Mart hadn't even gotten started, though there is one paragraph in the book (can't remember where) in which Elkin almost envisions its inevitability. At any rate, the story of a man named Ben Flesh who inherits the prime rate for loans from his 18 god-siblings (4 sets of triplets, 3 sets of twins, all born within 7 years) and uses the money to buy stores in franchises all over the country, and drives constantly to visit his managers, is funny as can be. Since Flesh also suffers from MS (a metaphor, of course, for the ways in which Americans can no longer feel things), it's also, well, not sad, but sometimes a little harsh. This was only the second Elkin book I've ever read, and he drops in tons of St. Louis tid-bits just for extra fun.
