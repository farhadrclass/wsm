This book pleasantly reminded me of another book about the magic of food from another culture--The Mistress of Spices. We learn of the sisters' experiences in Iran through flashbacks throughout the book, and I really appreciated Mehran's light touch in her descriptions of the sisters' painful memories. In my opinion, too many books are heavy-handed and overwhelming with sadness when they flashback to such events. Mehran had just the right combination of sadness and facts that made me want to learn more about this terrible time in Iran, but did not frighten me away from the violent history. In Ireland, the sumptuous exotic spices of the sisters' cooking reinvigorate the aspirations of the townsfolk in Ballinacroagh and bring them together. I (of course) was hungry the entire time reading the book and would love to try some of the recipes that Mehran includes before every chapter. A yummy light read that delivered all it promised. I am looking forward to discussing it at my book club on Monday and will post any other revelations our discussion brings. On a happy note, this might be my most successful book club pick ever--thanks Holyn for joining GoodReads so I could read your review!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer (JC-S)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s", "userReview": "Sometimes it is good to suspend belief and surrender your imagination to a form of magical realism which can transcend cultural barriers.Three orphaned sisters, who fled Iran seven years earlier, have found their way to a small town in Ireland where they hope to make a home. They bring with them their heritage, their demons and their hopes for a better future. Marjan, Bahar and Layla open the Babylon Cafe in the heart of Ballinacroagh\u2019s Main Mall. The smell of traditional Persian cooking wafting through the Mall works its own magic on many of the townsfolk: business is growing as is acceptance. But the past is not yet finished with the sisters, and their future is threatened. In part this novel is about the clash of cultures and inherent suspicion about what is different. It is equally about the power of hope and the unifying role of food and the role of senses in life. In many ways, both the characters and the setting are irrelevant to these unifying points. The setting could be small town anywhere, the sisters could have any different cultural heritage. At the same time as each sister confronts her demons, many of the townspeople find the courage to question their own assumptions and values.The novel contains some delicious recipes which some readers will wish to try, while others of us will simply enjoy the possibility. While many of the characters are lightly drawn stereotypes this doesn\u2019t really detract from the power of the novel. A comparatively light read to be sure, but one with a powerful underlying message for those who want to accept it."}, {"userName": "Mai Laakso", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49155830-mai-laakso", "userReview": "Jos kaipaat lukukokemukseltasi mausteita, herkullisia ruokia ja jopa reseptej\u00e4, iranilaisen Marsha Mehranin Lumoavien mausteiden kahvila (Pomegranade Soup 2005, suom. 2006) sopii sinulle.

Mehran builds textural layers of the senses, taking the reader on a voyage of food and places. In the process, she portrays food as the vehicle it is in bringing people together and introducing new cultures. Indeed, 11 fairly straightforward Persian recipes are included so the reader can do the same. This uplifting tale is wonderful tribute to family, community and new beginnings.

There was such lot to like about this book - I'm a sucker for a cozy novel about food, initially it seemed a lightweight derivative of \"Like water for chocolate\" - which is brilliant & of course you can't expect every novel to invent a new genre. There is quite a bit of interesting and quite dark material about fleeing from Iran & then her sometimes insightful & sometimes rather dismissive view of Oirland. However ultimately I found this novel really lacked the cohesion of a more successful work. The character development was poor, the pacing was awful, the story was okay but lacked direction. Incidents & characters just popped up & disappeared. There was a strange mix of fragmented past history (without much insight - neighbour mean, husband was abusive) & then silly jolly asides about leprechauns, naughty local pranksters & ambitions of a disco - which didn't really progress the story or add much dimension to the characters. Comparing to some pretty solid novels that I have awarded with 3 stars, I felt bound to be a bit cruel here."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/738261-cynthia", "userReview": "Fabulous story of Iranian women fleeing the revolution who land in a small Irish town.

It\u2019s here that Marjan, Berhar and Layla are planting their roots after having fled Iran during the Iranian revolution of 1979 via Pakistan to the safe shores of London. Having toiled in the U.K. for a while, they have found solace in the beautiful country of Ireland, where they feel they can put the past behind them and start afresh by recreating the wonderful foods they grew up with - dolmeh, red lentil soup, baklava, dugh yogurt drink, abgusht, elephant ears, lavash bread, torshi, chelow, fesenjoon, pomegranate soup, etc. Each chapter begins with a recipe and through the wonderful and exotic aromas and flavors of Marjan\u2019s cooking we experience the cathartic play of food and its significance in the lives of the three sisters. But Iranians settling in the village of Ballinacroagh is not an everyday occurrence; people are curious \u2013 the aromas emanating from the Babylon Caf\u00e9 are different, tantalizing, strange.

Ageism, sizeism, looksism. Apparently physical infirmities, such as urinary incontinence, are also signs of moral failing. I got to \"...Cecilia Devereux, the county mayor's two-hundred-and-twelve-pound nymphomaniacal daughter...\" and would have stopped but I'm reading this with a group. This book is a hot mess in so many ways. I wish the author had written a memoir; it sounds like she had a very interesting life. She died at such a young age; really sad and I have a feeling I would have liked her. But I can't recall the last time I read a (traditionally published) book that was so incoherent on so many levels. Just for example, the book shifted gears drastically at about the halfway point, with no foreshadowing of any kind. I would say that the end wound things up too easily and quickly but that would suggest there was more narrative logic than there actually was. I put two stars in as a placeholder but would prefer not to rate this."}, {"userName": "Moonika", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36287778-moonika", "userReview": "Lugu 3 \u00f5est, kes p\u00f5genesid Iraanist vahetult enne revolutsiooni.

The author presents very interesting and entertaining character descriptions, although sometimes I wondered why she went into such depth on descriptions of minor characters, but overall I really appreciated the character descriptions. The food was another character, and that was very well described -- I already had an appreciation for Persian cuisine, and these descriptions made me want to hurry to my favorite Persian restaurant.I felt that that the conflicts were resolved a little too neatly at the end, and so the end was not quite satisfying enough for me.I would rate this book PG-13 because of profanity (especially from certain characters) and because of the descriptions of the atrocities that some of sisters suffered at the start of the Iranian revolution."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11051453-heather", "userReview": "Another pleasant surprise! Picked this up off the shelf at the library and thought it was my kind of book. And boy was I right. This book is kind of Maeve Binchy meets The Kite Runner. On first glance it looks like a sweet book about three Iranian sisters who move into a tiny Irish town and open a cafe. But the flashbacks to Iran a the time of the revolution, the glimpses into the sister's lives and why they fled Iran make this a much deeper, richer book. It is also full of wonderful descriptions of food and every chapter starts with a recipe. I have many Iranian neighbours and this book gave me a new appreciation for where they came from and what it means to leave your home for a completely new world.This is a small book, a very quick read and I can't recommend it highly enough."}, {"userName": "Jenny Macdonald", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5913422-jenny-macdonald", "userReview": "Light and easy reading this is a tale of 3 sisters who escape the brutal and terrorising effects of the Iranian revolution and one of their sadistic husbands. Arriving at a small town in Ireland they set up Babylon Caf\u00e9 making sumptuous and exotic Persian foods and soon the town is seduced by such delights as fresh herb kuku, lamb abgusht and elephant ear fritters washed down with jasmine tea from a samovar. Braving the bullying and catty locals they win over the majority of the town and soon love and friendship helps soothe away the terrifying memories and the sisters feel peace and happiness. Like Chocolate and La Cucina food takes prominence and permeates the story with it's detailed preparation and spicy aromas. There's even recipes too if you want to really join in with the fun."}], "description": "Guidata dal vecchio giardiniere che curava in Persia le terre della sua casa d\u2019infanzia, Marjan Aminpour ha imparato sin da bambina a coltivare le piante.
