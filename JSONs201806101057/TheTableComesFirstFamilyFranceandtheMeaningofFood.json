He's brilliant and often funny. He loves his family, France, and food. Though not overtly political, he has liberal sensibilities. He has a wide range of interests in sync with my own, including urbanism, sports, classic novels, and music from Bach to the Stones. And he has interesting insights into aspects of daily life that most of us take for granted. So there are always some great nuggets in anything he writes, but this book is a disappointment. For starters, he takes far too intellectual and abstract an approach to earthy subjects; there are too many food critics here and not enough cooks and eaters. The structure of the book is bizarre: each section begins with a tangent to \"the table\" and ends with an e-mail to Elizabeth Pennell, a 19th century food writer (I get the idea - it's a way to comment on how radically cooking & dining have changed - but it comes off as strained). And way too many of the paragraphs have the same structure: opening abstract statement (usually about appetite or desire), some USA Today-style pop psychosociology (\"We\" want this or that), and closing bons mots based on more abstractions. If I'd ordered this book in a restaurant, I'd have sent it back to the kitchen."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6460479-sara", "userReview": "okay, you tell me...\"As museums cross, or so Updike tells us, with the mystique of women, restaurants cross in memory with the optimism of childhood, with birthdays, promises, quiet, and the guilty desires of childhood, too: special treatment, special favours. The Cardinal who never arrives, who sweeps you up into his carriage saying, 'Child, you please me,' becomes the Maitre d' who says, 'Ah, sir, we're so glad to see you!'(page 17)Come on, that is ridiculous writing. If you make an obscure reference, please let people know WTF you're talking about. Museums cross with the mystique of women do they? How, please tell me? And who is this cardinal you keep referring to, who never arrives but also sweeps me off my feet? What if I've never read Updike; it would help to know which book you're referencing and maybe the context.Or how about something Gopnik refers to as the dirty-sounding \"familiar wet progression'(p. 26): \"We would be have been struck, for one thing, by how odd their drinking habits were, with sweet wines offered throughout the meal - sherries and ports. The familiar wet progression - starting with champagne, and then a bottle of white wine, on to red wine, then liqueurs and brandies, ending with a sweet wine - is a late invention, and largely English.\" How odd, indeed! I know, I never go to a restaurant without having a wet progression. Those 18th century barbarians didn't start with champagne!I've only just started the book, but I have been moved by Gopnik's pompous, bourgeois writing to post my first-ever review.

Culinary, French, what could be better? I'm finding myself skimming, skipping much of the book; however, some parts are interesting. I'll reserve judgement.Okay ... I should just erase the above. As I picked up the book a second time, I knew I needed to start anew and read with a fresher and keener eye; in doing so I realized the full circle the author had come from beginning to end. Mr. Gopnik takes the reader on a tour of the history of food and food styles, changes along the way, the importance in society of sitting down to the table, the memories that are created in doing so. Along the way he creates a second story of sorts in his imaginary emails to English writer Elizabeth Pennell - they share a love of cuisine; the author also uses the emails to ultimately share a universal truth that seems not in keeping with the story but which ties into the beginning and end of the book. In all, The Table Comes First is a wonderful and interesting whirlwind into the wide world of food."}, {"userName": "Todd", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7324906-todd", "userReview": "Among the most self-indulgent, over-intellectualized works I've ever encountered--and I actually enjoyed law school. Given my enjoyment of Mr. Gopnik's other work, I am a little surprised to have been so annoyed by this one. However, after suffering through dozens of pages on \"taste\" as characterized by Hume, Rousseau, Veblen, Becker and others, I suppose I shouldn't. That said, the sparkle and wit so common to his writing occasionally shines through--in his \"correspondence\" with Elizabeth Pennell and the chapter \"In Vino Veritas,\" for example. Gopnik is unquestionably passionate about food and has thought deeply and carefully about the subject. However, the book seems far too overwrought to me, its efforts to elevate the everyday a stretch.

He can take the simplest of activities---like cooking, for example---and he can find great wisdom there. Half the time I don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s talking about as I\u2019m reading along; it\u2019s only later, when I\u2019m looking over his words again, that his thoughts become clear to me.Here\u2019s another example of Gopnik\u2019s wisdom that often goes over my head in a first reading, truth that is wiser than simple information about cooking and eating: \u201cIt seems to me that the real spirit of localism---the thing most worth taking from it---is the joke: the playful idea of the pleasure of adventure, the idea, at the heart of most aesthetic pleasures, that by narrowing down, closing up, the area of our inquiry, we can broaden out and open up the possibilities of our pleasures.\u201dAnd not only does he find deep wisdom in simple activity, but he shares his ruminations with a cleverness that few essayists display:\u201cYes, of course, everybody\u2019s recipe is someone else\u2019s recipe, with the exception of those few rare new things that someone really did invent\u2026.But there is a recipe that has, so to speak, through suffering become yours, unlike those that you have simply copied out of a book. We recognize the concept of sweat equity in recipe writing: if you have labored nightly over a stove in a restaurant kitchen cooking the thing, then you can write it down, even if its origins lie ultimately not in your own mind but in someone else\u2019s cooking.\u201d\u201cThe good food of twenty-five years ago always looks unhealthy; the good food of fifty years ago always looks unappetizing; and the good food of a hundred years ago always looks inedible.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, or in the other fork\u2026.\u201dAnd beneath his wisdom and his cleverness, Gopnik shares little tidbits of the craft that help us all:Gopnik suggests that everything is better by adding a little saffron and cinnamon or bacon and anchovies. He also shares the surprising truth that good cooks either go very hot or surprisingly cold. They have time."}, {"userName": "Maureen M", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/944992-maureen-m", "userReview": "Here's my review for the Star Tribune newspaper:For his last meal on earth, Adam Gopnik would have roast chicken with lemon and an apricot souffle for dessert. Or maybe beef with b\u00e9arnaise sauce, with chocolate pot-au-cr\u00e8me for dessert.Questions of food consume Gopnik in \u201cThe Table Comes First: Family, France and the Meaning of Food,\u201d an exploration of eating from the earliest restaurant in pre-Revolutionary Paris to what we find at our dinner tables now. Gopnik travels from the United States to Europe, from the past to the cutting edge, posing the question: Why do we eat what we eat?The book has the outline of a meal \u2014 starters through dessert \u2014 and the unevenness of a progressive dinner. Some stops are delightful. Others disappoint.Gopnik is at his best when he\u2019s out exploring, and is at his weakest when he\u2019s giving history lectures.This book lacks the charm of \u201cParis to the Moon,\u201d Gopnik\u2019s 1990s collection of essays for the New Yorker when he was a new father introducing his little boy to Paris. But he recaptures that spirit in places.It\u2019s there when he introduces us to the death-row inmate contemplating his favorite meals. It\u2019s there when he introduces Elizabeth Pennell, a Victorian-era food critic with un-Victorian attitudes toward food and sex. He is so taken with this \u201cNigella Lawson of the age of Whistler\u201d that he strikes up an imaginary correspondence, dropping e-mails to Pennell between chapters like palate cleansers. It\u2019s there when his son, now a teenager, makes a cameo appearance. Father, son and daughter forage Central Park in search of edible greens in an entertaining test of the eat-local movement. Gopnik\u2019s long experience with France and fine dining yields some fine observations. He sees the provocation in the word \u201cLe Fooding,\u201d concocted to poke French cuisine off its pedestal and back into the culinary game. He taps Minnesota\u2019s own Thorstein Veblen, a 19th-century economist, to explain food trends. In places, you feel as if you\u2019re sitting across the table from an amusing friend recounting his adventures. In others, you feel like the outsider at a dinner party where the conversation drones on about people and places you don\u2019t know. Then comes dessert, and all is well again. Like the \u201ctechno-emotional\u201d dessert wizards he visits in Spain, Gopnik saves his best for last: \u201cWhat is it that we want from eating? Comfort? Absolutely. A symbol of love shared? For sure. \u2026 We can have our cake and eat it, too, if we are willing to see that the point of having cake is to eat it and accept that then it will be gone.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Vuk Trifkovic", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4530266-vuk-trifkovic", "userReview": "Mixed feelings about this book. For a start, I felt starved for propert writing about writing about the food. We're all deluged with cook-books, culinary supplements, restaurant reviews, but there is very little writing about this trend. So, who better to do it but Adam Gopnik, essayist supreme of New Yorker fame.Indeed, he does a very good job, but perhaps he's little bit too good. The essays are great, but feel bit winding and not in 'this is where my mind takes me' and more along the lines of 'what was I saying again'. There are some very clever ploys too, like the progression of topics from the start of the restaurant meal to desert or imaginary correspondence with Elizabeth Purnell. However, there are slippages and missteps. After a while, the email series gets bit laboured and topics bit jumbled. \"Fooding\" movement for instance, makes two rather disjointed appearances even though it's quiet obvious that neither the author really finds there is much to it, nor they seem to be capable of keeping reader's attention.Having said all that, Gopink's writing is wonderful, UK edition hardcover is a wonderful object and there's precious little writing of this caliber out there. It's just frustrating that the author did not go the extra mile in this one, even though he's patiently capable of it."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Theiss", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss", "userReview": "Keeping company with Adam Gopnik is reminiscent of conversation at a long French dinner party where food, philosophy and life are woven into a deeply enjoyable tapestry. At the end, we sigh and move on with our lives and the happy memory of an evening well-spent. Gopnik's essays touch on some of my favorite topics--wine and Parkerism, the history of restaurants, the ethics of locavorism, food as art and the art of cooking. I can't say I always agree with him, but I invariably appreciate the ideas he brings to the table. Let's talk about wine for a minute. I cannot agree that wine quality is entirely a matter of individual taste. If you've tasted a first-growth Bordeaux or an excellent burgundy, it is hard to believe that you could then assert that a California zip code wine is somehow equivalent. Yes, descriptive adjectives help wine drinkers to distinguish subtle flavors, and the setting in which wine is served influences our opinions of it. Yet, a good wine is distinctive in the pleasure it provides and very different from a bad wine, which is likely to make an entire table wince."}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1155122-michele", "userReview": "Adam Gopnik reads like MFK Fisher, minus heart, charm, or lovely turns of phrase.While some of his writing did have humor, I could almost hear the New Yorker guffaws after punch lines.

A sort of history, evaluation of the current state of the culinary world, the progress it has made, from home-cooked to fine dining. It was, and it wasn\u2019t.It took me three weeks to read this book. And that involved a LOT of skimming. Because while Gopnik is full of passion about food and eating (mostly French/French-styled food), he enjoys a too long philosophical ramble, one which leaves more questions than answers, and sometimes it\u2019s all a bit too preachy like he\u2019s glaring at us from his high culinary pulpit especially when he\u2019s going on about the meat-vs-veg debate (nevertheless to say, I skimmed that chapter).I hesitate to recommend The Table Comes First to anyone, even if you are a foodie. I mean, I love to eat and read about food and all that, but how I struggled with this book. It was not a fun read, it wasn\u2019t all that insightful either. It was too Franco-centric, largely ignoring most of the non-western world. It is obvious that his target audience are those who have already eaten at Momofuku and El Bulli and all those \u2018top\u2019 restaurants.However, if I hadn\u2019t read it, I would not have come across to Elizabeth Pennell, whose 1900 book The Feasts of Autolycus, the Diary of a Greedy Woman (available as an ebook here) begins:\u201cGluttony is ranked among the deadly sins; it should be honoured among the cardinal virtues.\u201dGopnik decides to start \u2018emailing\u2019 Elizabeth Pennell, which is a little silly, but at other times, entertaining as he details his attempts in the kitchen.And even more so for that great bibliography at the end because with the exception of the Steinberger book, I have not heard of any of them.

Buried within the minutiae are some very intriguing insights about the meaning of food in our culture, but it was too easy to lose sight of that. Gopnik is in need of a good editor.

Gopnik's clear passion for the subject and his enthusiastic storytelling made it perhaps more enjoyable than it might have been to read.The history, stories, and anecdotes he provides are all entertaining and informative, and Gopnik's style funny and approachable, but the structure of the book was a bit distracting. Toward the beginning Gopnik states that in the current world of foodies, food writers, locavores, etc., the focus of the meal has become the food itself, not the joys of the table; the company, the conversation, the progression of the courses, etc. We nod our heads in agreement and expect him to then expound on this, showing us the error of our ways and how we should return our attention to the whole of the meal.However, what follows is a collection of rambling essays on the history of the restaurant, the history of recipe books, the state of contemporary chefs and so forth, all seen through Gopnik's Francophile eyes. These are punctuated by emails to a deceased food writer, which he uses as a device to tell his personal histories related to food and to relay his own favorite recipes or cooking tips.While I enjoyed the book from beginning to end, it seemed to me a bit disjointed and scattered. Almost as if the author were trying to cram too much in and lost his train of thought in the process. ADD: Currently half way through Gopnik's Paris to the Moon, which I quite like.

He name drops a lot which probably means a lot if you have a lot of money and can eat in these really posh restaurants or you just study food gossip.

An illuminating, beguiling tour of the morals and manners of our present food manias, in search of eating's deeper truths, asking \"Where do we go from here?\"Never before have so many North Americans cared so much about food. But much of our attention to it tends towards grim calculation (what protein is best? how much?); social preening (\"I can always score the last reservation at xxxxx\"); or graphic machismo (\"watch me eat this now\"). Gopnik shows we are not the first food fetishists but we are losing sight of a timeless truth, \"the table comes first\": what goes on around the table matters as much to life as what we put on the table: families come together (or break apart) over the table, conversations across the simplest or grandest board can change the world, pain and romance unfold around it\u2014all this is more essential to our lives than the provenance of any zucchini or the road it travelled to reach us. Whatever dilemmas we may face as omnivores, how not what we eat ultimately defines our society.Gathering people and places drawn from a quarter century's reporting in North America and France, The Table Comes First marks the beginning a new conversation about the way we eat now.", "title": "The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10529697-the-table-comes-first", "average": 3.34, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333576524l/10529697.jpg", "reviews": 175, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4747.Adam_Gopnik", "name": "Adam Gopnik"}], "type": ["Food and Drink", "Nonfiction", "Cultural", "Writing", "Travel"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10529697-the-table-comes-first", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10529698-the-table-comes-first", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13005682-the-table-comes-first", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13126463-the-table-comes-first", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13414675-the-table-comes-first", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7062.Paris_to_the_Moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7111.Through_the_Children_s_Gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7113.The_King_in_the_Window", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6071984-angels-and-ages", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4586825-the-best-american-essays-2008"]}
