Nothing more, nothing less. These issues exist to usher in the conclusion of the first compendium. It\u2019s filler material, appropriate filler material, though it\u2019s still a little dull. It\u2019s a foreshadowing of the climax. The group arm themselves and set up the prison\u2019s defences. An attack in the next volume is only appropriate. But this was a little dry. Carol\u2019s fate was aloes quite random. I mean we all knew it was coming. She\u2019s been degrading for a while, but to throw herself away like that seemed a little extreme even for her. I much prefer T.V Carol. She\u2019s a badass. She\u2019s very much a female Rick. It\u2019s a shame she\u2019s not stronger here, though I suppose a character similar to her may come at a later date.

So much happens! Really I think this, aside from the first volume, is the best so far at individual development of characters. After the Woodbury incident and story arc everyone realizes they need to restock on ammunition and supplies if they are to survive any possible attack by Woodbury which seems imminent now. Rick comes to terms that with his new disability he can't do everything and be the hero/leader anymore and needs to take a backseat role to the able bodies people they have. Yes this volume still has guns firing and bullets flying, even people dying, but the majority of it revolves around relationships being made, Rick and Lori having a baby, Glenn and Maggie debating about having a baby of their own and starting a family with things how they are, Dale having to cope with jealousy and some other new developments, Alice getting thrown into her new role as the doctor, Andrea taking the role of the group protector/sharpshooter/firing instructor, etc. A lot happens and Kirkman is true to form with a last page cliffhanger that leaves you screaming! A real great volume and must read for any Walking Dead fan."}, {"userName": "Gabby", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby", "userReview": "Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh! This volume was amazing! I love how this volume started with a flashback of Lori and Shane. It was nice to see what actually happened with them when Rick was still in a coma. Glenn and Maggie finally have their wedding! It's the cutest shit ever, with Hershel as their pastor and what not. I just love Glenn and Maggie so much. I really enjoyed the scenes with Tyreese, Glenn, Maggie and Michonne going to the National Guard place and taking out all the Woodbury men. It was epic. SPOILERS BELOWSo, Lori finally had the baby! And surprisingly, nothing went wrong. The baby was born naturally and Lori lived through it and decided to name the girl Judith. I was kind of shocked by this because as we all know in the tv show, Lori has a very unsafe, unplanned delivery and is killed instantly. Now I'm wondering when and how Lori will die? Or if she will die? I don't even know. But Dale got bit on his leg while trying to get gas for the generator while Lori was delivering the baby and they had to cut his leg off but this time it worked! Also, what the fuck? Carol already died? She basically committed suicide while walking up to a zombie? It's so ridiculous. Carol's character in the comics has got to be the most different in the actual tv show because Carol was a weak woman controlled by men in the comics but in the show she's so badass. I just don't understand. I was hoping she would turn it all around and become a badass like she is in the show, but no. Ugh, it's depressing. Also, Glenn and Maggie just decided then want to try and have a baby! Like what even. That just happened in the show in season 6 so this seems really soon. I mean they are still at the prison after all. Also, HOLY SHIT THE ENDING. THE GOVERNOR IS ALIVE AND HE'S COMING TO TAKE THE PRISON I KNEW HE WASN'T DEAD ASKLDHJAK. This was one of my favorite moments from the tv show and I'm so freaking excited to read Volume 8!"}, {"userName": "Fables&Wren", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42780417-fables-wren", "userReview": "WrensReads Review:Oh my word, what a whiplash.

Toodles, stupid. Otherwise, this one was a little slower than past volumes, except for The Night of The Nurse, in which all of the things happened. Then calm, hence the title, and then BOOOOOOOOOM.

The group are really settled at the prison and then just when they feel safe and secure, the Governor turns up at the end shouting to his crew to kill them all for a nice little cliffhanger ending. Lori finally gives birth to her daughter Judith, and it's actually nice to see her and Rick being happy for once. They always just seem to be pissed off at each other before this issue. I suppose that's married life ;) I don't particularly like Dale's insecurities in this issue. He gets bit on the leg and they chop it off (basically like Hershel in the TV show), then he gets all worried about Andrea leaving him for Tyreese for no reason whatsoever. It just seemed random. The other thing I didn't like as much was Carol's character. She has basically been on a downward spiral after she saw Michonne giving Tyreese head a few volumes ago. Then after a talk with Lori, she just goes and sleeps with Hershel's teenage son, then let's a zombie eat her. It just felt like they didn't know what to do with her character so they killed her off in a weird way. Maybe it's just me who feels that way.I prefer it when they are walking around and it's constantly nail biting because they don't know when a zombie will pop up.

Meanwhile, Maggie and Glenn tie the knot and Lori finally gives birth but still more death and tragedy befalls the small group. I thought after the craziness of Woodbury and the Governor that this volume would be much less interesting as it\u2019s more or less a return to the status quo but it\u2019s still chock-full of great stuff. Dare I say it - Robert Kirkman does some decent character-work in this book! Carol, the mother of Sophia who also tried to commit suicide earlier in the series, has been slowly unravelling these last few books and Kirkman does fine work in showing her fatalistic state of mind - her speech towards the end gives the reader a glimpse into her life in the group and her perspective on how she views them. It\u2019s a very real moment that made Carol seem like an actual person.Kirkman also keeps things exciting for the reader by having the group looking for the National Guard Station encounter some of the Governor\u2019s men while, back at the prison, Lori goes into labour at night with the generator about to run out of gas, and Billy and Dale have to venture out in the zombie-infested parking lot to siphon more fuel. It is amazing that before they sent out the most able among them to gather ammunition from the National Guard Station that they didn\u2019t ensure they had enough fuel for the generator. They didn\u2019t know how long they\u2019d be gone and they knew one of their group was about to give birth, but still they don\u2019t bother to top up the fuel containers from nearly empty to full? What a bunch of idiots! And the death and mutilation remains funny, to me at least, because it\u2019s so over-the-top. When zombies aren\u2019t popping out of the shadows like diseased jack-in-the-boxes, characters are happily dying, smiles on their faces! Still, The Calm Before is a highly enjoyable volume that\u2019ll keep readers deeply invested in the series - especially with THAT finale! The Calm Before, indeed."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "While my enjoyment of The Calm Before is way down compared to the other installments I've read of The Walking Dead, I think there was a real story telling wisdom behind the lull in action crafted by Robert Kirkman.Our crew of survivors are still hanging out in the prison, and time goes by -- for the characters -- rather quickly. Some shit happens: Lori give birth to Judith; Dale loses his foot (the first successful amputation of a Zombie infected limb) and starts to suspect Andrea and Tyreese or bumping uglies; Glen and Maggie decide to start making their own babies; Carol ends her whinging with a Zombie embrace (such a cool way to go in Zombie world); and a bunch of our Survivors raid a National Guard base for gas, guns and ammo and a Wal-Mart for canned goods.Then they wander around and pontificate while eating Herschel's fresh produce; or they practice shooting the Roamers while convincing themselves that the Governor and the folks of Woodbury will surely leave them alone; or they descend a little further into madness. But for the reader this is all slow, slow going. Which is probably good because this installment ends with the Governor riding in, one-armed, on a tank with his own little battalion of humans to take over the prison. I think we needed this break, boring though it is, before we are Made to Suffer. I hope it all picks up again, though, because I've not been a fan of the last 10 issues. Maybe the death of the Governor, if that's what's coming, will perk me up."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1774665-matt", "userReview": "For the most part, reviewing volumes of The Walking Dead seems pointless to me because, well, the idea's pretty damn basic - zombie apocalypse, civilization as we know it has toppled, people live in fear everyday while trying to still get by, survive, and hold onto things worth living for. Over the past 6 volumes, we've gotten to see people grow close to each other and lose loved ones, and Rick has definitely gone through his issues, realizing that it'll take more than being \"good\" to survive and protect his family. It's not a perfect series - some moments become a bit melodramatic, including an unintentionally hilarious illustration of Lori confronting Rick about her time with Shane - but it's still gripping and entertaining, with just enough investment given to each character so that the fear death hangs over each one.If this were the TV series, volume 7, The Calm Before, would probably be the stretch of episodes I'd hate because, well, nothing much happens. Yet, as Kirkman's talents as a storyteller have grown, I found this calmer volume to be one of my favorites, if only as a believable breath of fresh air, when danger comes not necessarily from zombies or other groups of people, but from despair, a lull in the action that allows the characters to dwell on their unhappiness and their sins. As the title suggests, danger's not far off, but that gives Kirkman all the time he needs to show what peace might be like in this post-apocalyptic landscape.P.S. You probably shouldn't read volume 7 unless you have volume 8. They work perfectly together, and the last page of volume 7 will send you to volume 8 immediately."}, {"userName": "\u2623Lynn\u2623", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7101656-lynn", "userReview": "[Carol is dead.

Robert Kirkman takes an entire chapter to lull his readers into a bit of complacency. Perhaps he is trying to get his readers to experience the idea he is driving home in this volume: sit in safety long enough and you will forget how to protect yourself.The lack of good times and warm moments seems all the more pronounced by the almost overwhelmingly good feelings provided here by things like a small wedding, and of course, the ultimate antithesis of death: birth. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t some bad moments. Another chapter falls, one loses a leg. Kirkman has established his mythos by now, A bite like the one that claims \u2019Roger\u201d in Dawn of the Dead is not a death sentence in Kirkman\u2019s world.As has been the case throughout, the characters in this saga act in very real, very identifiable ways. The insecurities and uncertainties in all of us are manifested by the small band of survivors. Their beauty, and the power of this series comes from their \u2018realness\u2019. The Calm Before exposes the frailties more definitely and does an excellent job of setting the reader. It\u2019s the thrill of sitting in a dark movie theater, knowing something is going to jump out\u2026then it does and you STILL jump. That is the last three pages of volume seven.The last page is a return to the gut-wrenching, aggravating cliff hanger. This is the one that leaves you furious. Fortunately, those of you reading these reviews have the option of having chapter eight just a page away (if you own the hardcover compendium) or sitting beside you.For those of you new to this series, I challenge you to just wait twenty-four hours. Savor the anguish of those inside the prison fence, living in their false security.

A wedding, a birth, a basketball game, some gardening, \"shopping\", choosing which movie to watch next and the like. As the title suggests, their opportunity to indulge in the little things they took for granted before the zombie outbreak was inevitably short-lived, leading up to a not-too-surprising last page attack.Of course, it wouldn't be an installment of The Walking Dead without bloodshed, of the completely unexpected and same-stuff-another-day variety. Even with Michonne's mounting emotional problems, she can still be counted on to butcher foes, both undead and alive. Complacency proves to be a danger, which thankfully motivates those remaining to remember that the danger beyond the fence is still just as dangerous while they are safely inside.Carol, crazy, desperate Carol has grown on me the last few volumes. Her need for love outgrew her need for survival a long time ago. She's at her needy best here and seems as though she may have finally found the acceptance she was craving, if in a really bizarre fashion.The Calm Before was a good deal less thrilling than some previous installments of The Walking Dead, but I was pleased with the end result. Given how the future seems to be panning out for the survivors, this may be the last time we see them do anything as normal as have sex or joke about stale cereal.
