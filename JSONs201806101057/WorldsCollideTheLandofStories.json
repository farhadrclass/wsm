The tears haven't come yet but I know once I start reading another book I will realize that this series is over. The series I grew up reading is actually finished. No more adventures with Alex, Conner and the other characters.\ud83d\ude2d I'm not gonna say any spoilers for this so it's fine if you read this review but I will explain why you should read it and how it changed my life. This book came out when I was in fifth grade when I wasn't doing so well in school. Before our book fair we were shown books and what they were about. When The Wishing Spell came on I knew I had to buy it because it was everything I wanted in a story. It had fairytales and other dimensions. I read in like two days. Over the years this series has changed my life for the better. It is a place I can escape reality and wish I was there with Alex. I really connected with Alex because her and I are so similar. She loves to read. She's smart. She doesn't have many friends. But more so that she wants fairytales to be real. Alex and I would probably get along amazingly. When Chris announced that the last book would be coming out this year I admit that I cried. I cried because the books that helped me leave reality when I had a hard day at school or at home or just felt lonely were ending. I will forever miss this journey but also in a way I'm glad it ended because it's time for me to start my own adventure. These books have taught me so much about my life and with friendships. I will say that even though you won't read this Chris thank you for publishing these books and allowing me to learn and connect with all of these characters. I hope one day my children will also travel into the Land of Stories and learn so much about themselves. It's been a wonderful adventure. \ud83d\ude18"}, {"userName": "Leona  Carstairs", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63240900-leona-carstairs", "userReview": "**I AM CHANGING MY RATING TO A 3.75 STAR, BECAUSE THINKING ABOUT IT, THE WRITING WAS CHOPPY IN THIS INSTALLMENT.**Guys, there is a HAMILTON reference in this book!

This was the same for me, I give this whole series a five because this series has inspired me, and made me love reading more then I could ever imagine!!!!

This book was a nostalgic rollercoaster and it was all I could've wished for. I remember reading The Land of Stories for the first time and feeling my love for fairytales grow. I just cannot put into words how I felt while reading that one book, I saw myself represented as a bookworm and as the extremely insecure child I was. This series, oh God, even though it may sound stupid and all, this series helped me through quite a lot. I grew up together with this series and I kept lookig forward to getting the next book in my hands and after that devour it in one sitting. As I grew older (OKAY THIS SOUND A BIT LIKE I AM AN OLD GRANNY BUT STILL), these books were always there for me to read whenever I needed to. OKAY ENOUGH CHEESINESSNow about the book.Pros : *I liked the characteral development *I loved being reunited with all my favorite ones (CONNER, ALEX, RED, MOTHER GOOSE OFC)*SPEEKING OF MOTHER GOOSE, she is GREAT *I liked the way we got to see Evly again and the closure we got when it comes to her*Actually, I enjoyed seeing how almost all the characters got their own happily ever after *THE QUOTES IN THIS BOOK WERE SO SO SO INSPIRING *YAS ALEX and YAS CONNER *The setting YAS YAS YAS *I liked how we got to read a flashforward and see how a few of the characters were doing Cons :*Uhm, why was Charlotte such a distant mum? Like okay I get it, you are used to these adventures by now BUT LISTEN MA'AM they are your KIDS!!!! It seemed as if she wasn't even bothered in the slightest bit about Alex and Conner ugh*Did Arthur get the Holy Grail in the two months he promised it would take him to do so? *The writing was a bit weak in some places as if the author was hurrying to get over with it *Hero was brought into the adventure by Goldilocks but LISTEN he is a BABY he shouldn't need to be in danger of being eaten by WITCHES??!???!! Right???!!*Okay so we had Medusa right? But what happened next? I get that she needed peace and that's why she retreated but STILLL*Also, Evly. So she decided to be good and all however, why didn't she help our characters out? Okay I guess that that's about it, and I hope that everyone will read this series as it is a nostalgic explosion and will make one love fairytales to THE MAX. Thank you so so so much for writing The Land of Stories Chris Colfer!"}, {"userName": "Cc", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27234652-cc", "userReview": "***SPOILERS! BIG ONES! SERIOUSLY! BEWARE!***So, The Land of Stories series.Before I get to my review of the final book in the chapter, a bit of context:My daughter, age 5, heard of this series thanks to an appearance by the author, Chris Colfer, on the Netflix series \"Julie's Greenroom.\" My wife checked the first book in the series, The Wishing Spell, out for her, and she was totally hooked. And, admittedly, I was, too.The whole series is, to sum up, good-hearted and clever. It follows twins Alex and Connor Bailey as they enter another dimension called the Land of Stories--the source of all of *our* world's fairy tales. It deconstructs and mashes up almost every major fairy tale and fantasy story (at least those written by famous authors of European descent, anyhow) into an epic tale. It's intricately plotted, and its secret sauce is focusing on the characters' personal growth and overcoming obstacles--all in the midst of having adventures with dozens of fictional characters.It should be noted that the author, Chris Colfer, is the award-winning actor from TV's Glee--and he's completed an epic six-book fantasy series by age 27. He's got oodles of clever ideas, but tends to fall back on stock phrases over and over again (forms of \"tears came to their eyes,\" and \"their stomachs felt like they fell out of their bodies\" pop up conspicuously often, for example) ... and he's also exacting in his descriptions almost to a fault, oftentimes saying something in 20 words that could just as effectively have been said in 10. And, for the most part, almost every major character makes it through all six books virtually unscathed, with countless \"just in the nick of time\" moments saving the characters.But that said, he tells a heck of a yarn that pulled me in, and I had to see how the big finale would play out. True to a statement Colfer made in an interview, if the final book someday gets turned into a film, it'll be a very, very expensive one.So it's a shame that, despite note-perfect and true-to-character emotional beats throughout all the books, two flaws pop out at me in the final book. One, a relatively minor quibble ... and another, a massive plot hole that effects half the series (or based on the complex timelines of the series, the whole thing).Minor quibble: the final book has a connected prologue and epilogue that touch on Connor at age 80, offering a charming glimpse into who the young man becomes, as well as hints at the story we're about to read. Connor, you see, became a beloved children's book author, and wrote... a six-book series that's almost exactly like the Land of Stories series.So far, no biggie. But there's a passage that I'm assuming Colfer thought would be an amusing wink at the audience, but comes off as unintentionally, obnoxiously precious: Connor's series, its explained, became a profitable film series, spawning hefty merchandising and helping improve literacy.Ahem.Look, Colfer can write funny scenes and one-liners, but this bit of meta-commentary was played very matter-of-factly. For all the positive messages Colfer includes in his stories, *this* moment seemed smugly satisfied. \"Well of *course* my stories are loaded with positive messages. You're welcome!\" Maybe not his intent, but still.As far that other problem...So the last three books in the series are basically one big story arc, teed up by the events of the third book. They all boil down to the villains trying to use a magical Portal Potion--it can turn any work of fiction into a portal *into* that story's world--and the efforts of the heroes to stop their nefarious plans.The big bad of books 3, 4, and 5--and the one who gets the whole Portal Potion plot rolling--is The Masked Man, aka the Fairy Godmother's secret first son, aka Connor and Alex Bailey's secret uncle.The potion has very specific rules, but to sum up: three drops on the first page of any fictional work turns it into a portal. Step in, and there's a copy of that same book to use as a portal back. Get out before the story's over, and you're golden; if not, you're trapped.So far so good; rules established. Hinted at in book 3 and made explicit in book 4, the Masked Man's goal is to rule over the Land of Stories--and basically any world he can get his hands on--by using the Portal Potion. Indeed, he spends all of book 4 recruiting Captain Hook, the Wicked Witch of the West, and the Queen of Hearts (along with scores of their armies and minions) to help him succeed.In retaliation, Connor and Alex decide to counter by recruiting characters from *Connor's short stories*--all the better to relate to and understand characters of your own creation in order to conscript them into your army of good and right. That takes up book 5--in which Connor and Alex bring all of hundreds of recruits into their world, and manage to stash them in an unfinished hospital wing until it's time for the battle.And book 6? Worlds collide, and so do all of the armies.But...But...... Wouldn't it have been far easier for Alex and Connor to write a one-paragraph story called \"The Big Comfortable Hotel Where We Kept Our Army Until it Was Time for them to Fight our Uncle's Armies\"? I double-checked--yes, I had to--and nowhere is there a magic rule against writing a fresh story and turning *that* into a portal.Yes, Colfer gets a lot of comic mileage out of cramming scores of fictional characters into the same confined space--and in \"our world,\" no less--but given the resourcefulness of the twin protagonists, that seemed like either a massive oversight, or Colfer just wanting to play out the mother of all fish-out-of-water scenarios ... but at the expense of internal narrative logic or economy.... Taking it a step further ...We're told explicitly that the Masked Man (aka Uncle Lloyd) has literally spent almost his entire life plotting to rule the world, after having his magic taken from him as a child by his mother, the Fairy Godmother. He literally dreamed of it as a child. He's exacting, meticulous, patient, intelligent, and thorough. And, crucially, his mother *made the potion to cheer him up as a child,* so he knows its rules intimately.... So, with no rule against using a freshly-written tale to dive into, and after finally obtaining the potion as an adult...WHY didn't he write a story called \"The Tale of How Lloyd Gained His Magic Again and Recruited an Army of Millions of Indestructible Creatures Only He Could Control to Rule Over Every Dimension\"? He's a flashy villain to be sure, but he's more of a pragmatist than a showboat. I simply can't imagine how that wouldn't have been his only plan for decades. Instead, he goes on the most convoluted mission possible.That plot hole nagged me from the moment the Portal Potion came into play. Perhaps I'd missed something? Perhaps there was a rule that it had to be fiction, but, you know, written a year or more in the past?So through books 4, 5, and most of 6, I managed to convince myself that there must be some underlying rule preventing someone from whipping up a quick story to serve their portal purposes.And then...Characters in book 6 do exactly that. Twice.At critical points in the story.With no mention of \"Hey, we should of tried this before!\" or \"Good thing Uncle Lloyd never thought of that!\"One involves writing literally *just* the names of authors James Barrie, L. Frank Baum, and Lewis Carroll. (Charlotte, the twins' mother, needs to pick the authors' brains on how to defeat the villains they created. It's only mentioned in passing--a real shame we didn't delve into *that* more!)Further, by any definition, writing down three names, any names, with no context, isn't a work of fiction; it's not even a story. So, sub-plot hole there.The other, frustratingly, is at the climax of the book. The climax itself is beautifully written and appropriately tear-jerking... but looming over the whole scene like a stormcloud was the gaping, series-spanning plot hole. Sadly, it robbed what should have been the emotional high point of the entire series of its weight, as it was only manifested by hundreds of preceding pages built on a massive narrative snafu.That said, it's an optimistic series that champions the power of imagination, self-confidence, and believing in oneself despite impossible odds. Hopefully young readers will be inspired--and hopefully turn into young writers who can avoid gaping plot holes in their own stories...."}, {"userName": "Leela Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6971241-leela-martin", "userReview": "When I picked up this series 6 years ago, I instantly fell in love with the story and the characters. It was funny and charming! It quickly became one of my favorite series. However, I found the last two books to be a bit of a disappointment. In my opinion, none of the characters matured and developped much and some of the events in the last two books of the series were extremely unrealistic. *Small spoilers ahead. In this book, it really pissed me off when Connor and his friends climbed up into Central Park from the tunnels, because Connor comments on how weird it was that it took his friends 5 minutes to follow him yet he does nothing about it!!! He's been dealing with magic for 4 years yet doesn't think this is weird at all?!?! Especially when Red respond saying that they were right behind him... Another thing, I get that Goldilocks and Jack are strong and adventurous people, but really, bringing an 8 day old baby across the country to fight an evil army and not expect anything bad to happen.... It just seemed useless to bring the baby along. It's little things like this that made it hard for me to truly immerse myself in Colfer's story. None of it seemed realistic...

Bless. Due to what I presume was some kind of glitch in iTunes, I only payed a dollar for this book - which is about all it was worth. I enjoyed the first book A LOT, I liked it waaay more than I originally thought I would, but since then, the quality of this series has been falling steadily. I had to read the conclusion, though, and while I'm happy it was a fast and easy read, it wasn't as mind-numbingly boring as #5 (which I listened to while painting my apartment, and it was about as much fun as literally watching the paint dry). It was still boring though? Like, the fights? Why even bother writing them? Large parts of books #3-6 have just felt tired and drawn-out. I mean, I realize that I'm not the target group for this book. The target group is like 6-9 year-olds, I think? Possibly 9-12, but anyway, I'm still about 15-20 years \"too old\". However, since I very much enjoyed #1, I figured it wasn't a big deal. Also, I'm a massive fan of Rick Riordan, who also writes contemporary fantasy, for the same target group. I can make actual relevant comparisons, and in five years, they've never once been in Colfer's favor. My biggest annoyance with this series has always been its complete lack of representation and diversity. Five books, all over 300 pages long, and they contain ONE single mention of a gay character, in passing. An alcoholic, drug-abusing grandmother is apparently okay, as is an inter-species relationship between a queen and a frog, but a gay character? Absolutely not! Also like... race. Gender identity. Stuff like that. The whole series is depressingly cishet and white. Especially considering the weird self-congratulatory prologue where he literally writes \"As writers we have the profound privilege and responsibility to create a new world when the current one takes a turn for the worse. Storytellers are more than just entertainers, we're the shepherds of ideology, the street pavers of progress, and the scientists of the soul\" \u2013 yet he takes none of this responsibility in this series? And this is not me ~analyzing~ shit just for the sake of it \u2013 this is me literally yawning and skimming the loveydovey parts while reading.But now it's over!

Meine Meinung: Nachdem ich den 5ten Band bereits vor einem Jahr gelesen habe, habe ich einiges wieder vergessen. Mir ist es teilweise besonders schwer gefallen die Charaktere aus Conner's Geschichten richtig zuzuordnen. Mit anderen Charakteren wie Peter Pan und Robin Hood hatte ich nat\u00fcrlich keine Probleme, aber Conner's Geschichten haben mir damals nicht so gut gefallen und deswegen ist mir vieles wohl entfallen:). Chris Colfer's Schreibstil gef\u00e4llt mir nach wie vor recht gut und man merkt wirklich wie er von Buch zu Buch besser wird. Mit diesem Band ist die \"Land of Stories\" Reihe abgeschlossen und ich bin ein bisschen traurig diese tollen und lustigen Charaktere gehen zu lassen. Trotzdem konnte mich dieses Buch nicht so mitrei\u00dfen wie manche der Vorg\u00e4nger. Ich kann euch nicht mal genau sagen warum, es hat einfach das gewisse Etwas gefehlt. Auch wenn ich nicht so begeistert war wie von manchen anderen B\u00fcchern der Reihe, hat es mir trotzdem Spa\u00df gemacht es zu lesen :).

Also I thought there was only three of the ziblings. Also I know I said I liked the first three better but the fourth and fifth were also good. I just like the first 3 better.  ***KIND OF SPOILERS***But the Alex thing was ok. I didn't really like it. I couldn't tell who was a main character I assume it was supposed to be Connor but I don't really remember much of either of them in the book. I also seemed to be a bad guys winning then suddenly the good guys win. Nothing that bad happened to any of the characters practically no one died. Just rook who I completely forgot existed."}], "description": "The epic conclusion to Chris Colfer's #1 New York Times bestselling series The Land of Stories!In the highly anticipated conclusion to the Land of Stories series, Conner and Alex must brave the impossible.
