That's how the ending is going to be? I'm floored - I thought (in the way back recesses of my mind) that it may have been that way...but I was still surprised.Enjoyable apocalypse story - I so love the stories that revolve around women and how they handle themselves during the fall. Especially how they change for the better and become kick-ass heroines!Wolf?? I think I would have liked to have seen more of him in this ---- it breaks my heart. Sorry, can't say much more without giving away spoilers!"}, {"userName": "Jenessa David", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7942605-jenessa-david", "userReview": "Right off the bat, this series reminded me of 'Blue Plague: The Fall' by Thomas A. Watson. However, this book is what that book WISHES it could be. Everything Watson did wrong--showing instead of telling, pages of insignificant repeated details, inappropriate jokes (i.e. rape), unlikeable perfect Mary Sue characters--J. Walker got right. The few things Watson got right, Walker did BETTER. I read both this book and the second in the series in just two days because I couldn't put them down. This series excellently balances the survival and action/fighting aspects of the zombie apocalypse. And it definitely leaves you wanting more."}, {"userName": "Carey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24745430-carey", "userReview": "Great storyline!! I loved the choice of do you tell and share the knowledge or not. That struggle would be heart wrenching!

I really enjoyed this book and I hope part 2 comes out soon!This is an up and coming author!"}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10285365-donna", "userReview": "I finished this book in a day. It very much captured my attention. I like post apocalyptic books with or without zombies. This one has zombies. It is pretty much your standard zombie story told from a woman's viewpoint. This woman is one I did not particularly like in the beginning, as she was one to avoid facing hard choices and sort of buried her head in the sand for as long as she could, even with stern warnings and entreaties not to. When she finally does face the dread coming she rises to the challenge and continues to step up to meet them. She is separated from her husband but is able to take friends and her daughter to prepare for the zombie apocalypse that is coming. And as in most zombie stories, the most dangerous creature out there is man who without laws think they are entitled to take whatever they want....just because they can. And it does get intense.I am hoping a second book is coming. This one set a good foundation but there is much left to tell and I won't go into all the story lines here because it would ruin the power of them. Do read this book. It goes quickly and I did come to like the female protagonist much more than I did at the beginning, which was not at all.I guess I still have to question the wisdom of smoking pot and drinking booze when you may need all your energy and quick responses to respond to an incursion of some kind at any moment. But perhaps with nerves always on edge relaxing once in a while is okay, but when you are two people out on your own? Not wise in my zombie book. I do hope this author has a second book coming soon. I usually don't read series that aren't complete but this one grabbed me."}, {"userName": "Lucas Darathy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27597430-lucas-darathy", "userReview": "Damn. This was intense.I was sure it'd end like that, but it was still emotional.As for the plot... it's interesting that they had so much time to prepare. As in... unrealistic. However, I still liked it. It's better than the books where the characters go to the supermarket while it's all chaotic and still manage to get enough supplies. At least this made sense.Characters: I love them all. Sometimes I'd forget who was who, though. Amy, Amber, Ashley. So many names with A. And Matt, Mike, Marcus. John, Josh. So many names with the same initials... it can get a bit confusing sometimes. But I liked them all.Four stars. Well deserved. It's well written, it pulls you in. You care about the characters.

This story is amazing, it's different from most books in this genre. The characters having time to prepare rather than being blindsided was really interesting.

I understand we want the negative to be untrue and unfortunately the world does not work that way. We see her struggle with the apocalypse and what it might mean for her family. As the apocalypse comes closer we see how much she sacrifices for her family. I like how the characters meld with the story and they take a life of their own.

The actual zombie outbreak is kind glossed over but it works in the context of the story. There is still zombie action but not the relentless gore and attacks you get in other books. It works in this story though.There is a rape in this book but its done in a way that is not graphic but still brutal. So if you have a rape trigger you need to be aware that it is in the book toward the end. It works as part of the story and sadly is the reality of the breakdown of civilization. The story is told from the perspective of a woman. At first, she is annoying. I mean \"bury my head in the sand and pretend the evidence is not staring me in the face\" annoying. I wanted to smack her... a lot. But she gets it together and end up being pretty tough.There were a couple of.... yeah right moments. Like find property cheap with two farmhouse that are completely furnished including clothing and personal items like the previous occupants just got up one morning and walked out. Or the storage unit filled with pallets of hard to find equipment you need for your water purification unit. And why would you install a water purification unit if the replacement parts - like filters - are hard to get a hold of. There are other options for water purification out there - and I don't mean just boiling water. The marijuana use. Personally, I think it is stupid that we outlaw marijuana but alcohol is legal but that aside, when it was used in the story bothered me. For everyone out there, when you are on guard duty because there are zombies and possibly human killers outside your walls, that is not the time to smoke a joint. When you are a scavenging run for supplies and going into a situation where zombies could be lurking anywhere, that is not the time to smoke a joint. When you are off guard duty, not so much of a problem. It's better option than alcohol.Oh and when you have that feeling that you are being watched - you probably are. When the very experienced soldier tells you that your gut feeling is usually right and that you are probably being watched - you are. That is not the time to get drunk, smoke a joint and have a booty call. Seriously!Also, when the very experienced soldier who has special forces training thinks you've been watched but the watcher has covered their tracks really well... DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN. So no surprise that 3 days after the military presence has left the compound.... wait for it.... you get attacked by military trained personnel who want to take your stuff, your compound, rape your women, etc. I was surprised that the main character was surprised. I mean the bad guys did everything short of leaving a note on your front gate that said, \"Hey we've been watching you and as soon as your military guard is far enough away that they can't help you, we are going to attack, take your compound, your stuff, and your women. See you real soon. Sincerely, the bad guys.\"Other then those eye rolling moments, the story is actually really good. I love a good zombie story but I really love a good survival story. I love seeing a group of people coming together and building a community. And you got that in this story without it being survival/prepper porn. It bordered a bit on the buildup but I'll let it pass because the prepping didn't start until the main characters knew that things would get bad.There were a LOT of smart things done in this book. Things that I would think of doing. None of the dumb stuff like trying to ride out the apocalypse in a Walmart. None of the tropes like soldiers are always bad guys who never help civilians or the main character must be ex-military or ex-police. You didn't get the annoying whiner survivor and not every group that came to the gate was helpless. Teenagers didn't act like brats, who act out while zombies are pounding on the gates. Teenagers can be self-centered but they aren't stupid. I hate writers that treat them that way. It was nice to see them treated with a bit of reality. This was a really good start to a series and I look forward to reading the next book. Overall, despite the flaws it was a good story. That is the most important thing to me when I read a book. Did the author tell me a good story that I enjoyed."}, {"userName": "michael alan cast", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41310177-michael-alan-cast", "userReview": "Giving four stars for effort.Imagine: your not a hero. Your not an ex marine or special forces. Your not even a life long prepper....your just an average house wife. You've got kids. Your separated from your husband. WHAT DO YOU DO? Well, the character in this book by J. Walker steps up and tries to deal with the circumstances as best she can. It's obvious that the author doesn't have a great deal of knowledge about weapons, or other survival gear, but she gives an accurate account of what would happen to just an ordinary housewife in extenuating circumstances. I know how hard it is to break into the world of \"writing\". So I'm going to give the author an extra star for writing a book that was at least readable, (which is much better than some I've chocked down in the past)...So, J. Walker, do some research on some weaponry and other cool ordinance. Spend a little more time on the action instead of the mundane. That's just a suggestion you understand. At least you have actual books out on the market, so, bravo. That's a lot better than some of your critics can say."}, {"userName": "Bethany Compton", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9349840-bethany-compton", "userReview": "Good story.

So when her ex John and wife Amy arrive to share news about the so called bird flu outbreak in China, she is reluctant to listen. However when she and Marcus view the evidence, the four adults throw themselves into a joint rural compound where their families can be safe, before the zombie virus hits Canada. But however prepared you are, it can hit without warning and the families are scattered when the time comes to flee so they must all take the journey to the compound and hope everyone gets there safely.There was plenty to like about this zombie story. I liked the whole preparing for disaster beginning which others find slow, as I read a lot of similar books. I enjoyed watching what they were doing, the tension building as the outbreak creeps nearer. I also enjoyed the way the outbreak suddenly hits Windsor without warning, while everyone is collecting family from various places. It shows that you can never be totally prepared. The whole escape from Windsor was good, and the original set up of a new life in the compound was enjoyable. I liked the ending of the book though I was expecting it to happen-and I was pleased to see it happen. I also liked the raid on the compound story and the way it was written.I had an issue with the MC Emily. After not speaking in person to your ex husband for about a decade, you really think he and his wife came to visit you to tell you about a zombie apocalypse just to play a prank on you? Oh please! The fact John and Amy looked terrified, phoned continually to beg you to watch the flash drive that Derek sent them and gave you video evidence wasn't enough? It took ages to forget her personal feelings about John and work with him. Thankfully Marcus showed more sense. Emily elects herself leader despite having no clue how to do it, spends her time wallowing in personal misery instead of getting things done. She thinks they are being watched but instead of warning the others to put them on alert, she spends days having a self pity party and not getting a plan ready! She is very frustrating at times.There were good characters in this book who rarely got page time as everything was about Emily. Sam is a natural leader yet after his introduction we barely see him. His sons are relegated to potential love interests for Ashley and Sarah, or babysitters for the kids. John's story is shown impacting on Emily but not really on Amy. Bree and Amy are there only to give Emily someone to moan to or get comfort from. They were vastly underused which was disappointing. There was too much time spent on Jenna, who was obnoxious and reckless in her decision making. New characters kept being introduced but it seemed they were only brought in as love interests for other characters as they didn't seem to do much else.There was too much tell and not enough show-Bree's disaster happens over three lines so we don't get to feel the emotional storyline, we are told about what they are doing to get supplies but not letting us be there to experience it. There was not a great amount of exciting zombie action which I would have liked to see. I didn't feel any chemistry with Derek's romance and I'd have preferred to see him and Sam running things instead of both being supporting roles for the women to sleep with. Even the setting up of outposts seemed to be to further Derek's romance rather than provide an exciting development.These were personal niggles with the story but my main annoyance was the fact that the adults spend most of their time smoking dope and growing it at the compound. This really hacks me off. I'm not interested in hearing how nothing productive can be done until a joint has been shared. They smoke dope on guard duty despite zombies being there and a vicious militia gang operating nearby. Emily can't get out of bed in the morning to do her duties as she was up all night dope smoking with the girls as that was so much more important than spending time with her kids or running the compound. The whole group were smoking dope on the way to raids on the highways as well which is hardly sensible! If I'd wanted to read a book about dopeheads getting high every day, I'd have picked another genre to read. This plot ruined the book for me.Am I going to read on with the series? I'm not sure. I don't really want to read another two books about how great dope is and have the characters high all the time. The lack of show and abundance of drugs has really put me off what could have been a really great zombie novel.2.5 stars."}, {"userName": "T.
