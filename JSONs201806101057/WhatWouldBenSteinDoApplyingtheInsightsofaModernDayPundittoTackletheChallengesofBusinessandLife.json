I don't know what it is about this guy - his schtick is so low key but somehow it appeals to me (and apparently many others). I mean, in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, the scene where the author, then in his role as an actor, repeated Bueller's name over and over for roll call is iconic, and yet, for me, my favorite line in the movie was when Bueller's friend asked, \"OK, now that we're playing hookey, what're we gonna do today?\" And Bueller says, \"You're asking the wrong question. The real question is, 'What AREN'T we gonna do today?' \"Anyway, on to the book. It's another collection of \"essays of the obvious\". Again, I don't know why I'm drawn to these like a moth to the flame, but who am I to second guess my inclinations? Anyway, the editing (Or is it the writing? Let's hope not.) is pretty sloppy at some points, but Uncle Ben's mensch-ness shines through nonetheless. He repeatedly called himself \"your humble scribe\" and \"your humble servant\", and he repeatedly mentions his involvement in 12-step programs. So, he's easy to take, and not a holier-than-thou type.Anyway, as this review is getting to be a real meandering mess, let me just conclude by mentioning that reading these essays is like having a lunch conversation with someone who's really with it, really interesting, and who really cares. With the Stein patented dry humor added for seasoning. Give it a peak."}, {"userName": "NK", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/533391-nk", "userReview": "Plain old funny shit, really it is. I was pretty amused reading this book but also thought it was nice to see him add these personal elements to it as well regarding his life. It wasn't all rainbows & sprinkles. Even though most people recognize him from being in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, he had his tv show \"Win Ben Stein's Money\" back in the 90's. I think it's interesting about how he discusses marriage in various ways from how he & his wife went their separate ways & then were brought back together. He speaks highly of what it means to be married & how it's not easy. He speaks the value of working hard & not expecting people to just give you things willy nilly. He is adamant about character & values as a human being & making sure you do things you say you will (follow though). There are some really great life lessons that everyone can take from this book. Having it be funny is just a bonus."}, {"userName": "K2 -----", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3641623-k2------", "userReview": "Although I don't share the political slant of Ben Stein I do think he's fairly clever and well educated. A friend gave me this book and I am astonished that Wiley would even publish it. It is a quick read and certainly something that could be given as a gift by business people to other business people who don't have time to read a real book. It's a collection of his thoughts on life in a very very light form. If it weren't for the many blank pages it would hardly be a book, more like a list. I can imagine it being a gift for a twenty-something but not for someone who is more mature. There just wasn't enough there there for me, it cheapened his brand for me, disappointing indeed. I don't mind wading through a book for one important tidbit and that's why I kept reading... alas."}, {"userName": "Peregrine 12", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4597960-peregrine-12", "userReview": "If you'd like a few laughs and want to know someone else's opinions on day to day stuff, this would be a good choice. There is a tone of optimism in these pages that is nice to read.I know a lot of folks will pick at Stein's point of view on different things in this book, but I really, really liked his writing. Stein has opinions I didn't necessarily agree with, of course, but I still found his advice on work and love to be clearly spoken and rock solid. The part on respecting one's parents really struck a cord with me, and for that chapter alone I'm glad I read this book."}, {"userName": "Breandan \u00d3", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7931780-breandan", "userReview": "Common sense for a society that is in dire need of it.

For instance, Ben Stein wouldn't marry someone who refused to work or was a diva or had a drug problem. Any of those choices would be really bad. He wouldn't spend his entire paycheck and leave his bank account empty. He wouldn't arrive late to an appointment. (Most definitely not!) He wouldn't drive an ugly car. He's fairly certain he wouldn't pierce any part of his face. He also wouldn't preserve tax cuts and expect money to trickle down from the sky. And he would never invite a drunken stranger into his home (again).\"What Would Ben Stein Do?\" Read this book, and find out.
