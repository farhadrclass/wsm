I had never heard of Sijo before, and Linda Sue Park gives a very nice introduction to it - both in her introduction and her author's note. She also gives a list of tips for writing your own sijo. I thought the illustrations were just okay. Some were cute, but nothing spectacular.Sijo is similar to haiku with a syllabic structure, yet each line in the poem has its own purpose. The first line introduces the topic, the second develops the topic further, and the third always contains some sort of twist such as a pun, play on words, or humor. Since the lines can be long, sometimes the poems are written in a six-line format. Some of Park's poems are quite clever. She opens with one of my favorites: BREAKFASTFor this meal, people like what they like, the same every morning.Toast and coffee. Bagel and juice. Cornflakes and milk in a white bowl.Or--warm, soft, and delicious--a few extra minutes in bed.I also really liked:WORD WATCHJittery seems a nervous word;snuggle curls up around itself.Some words fit their meanings so well:Abrupt. Airy. And my favorite--sesquipedalian,which means: having lots of syllables."}, {"userName": "Hannah Cooke", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51993992-hannah-cooke", "userReview": "This book is full of clever poems called Sijo. I was drawn to this book because of its title. I have danced my entire life and tap dancing is my favorite. I thought this might be a poetry book about tap dancing, but I wasn't that disappointed when I found out it wasn't because it is still such an enjoyable book. I have not heard about Sijo, so this book exposed me to a new form of poetry. It highlights its origin, history, and form, and it provides lots of examples that are organized by topic, each with its own charm.I would use this book in the classroom during a poetry unit in a 3-5 classroom. This could be used as a read aloud book to introduce Sijo. By exposing students to what these poems can sound like and how fun they can be to read, it could spark students' interest in learning how to write their own. I would then place this book in my classroom library for students to reread and refer back to. This is a WOW book for me because it introduced me to a new form of poetry. Because the third line in each sijo tpically contains a pun or some form of word play, these poems are clever and fun to read."}, {"userName": "Bernice", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2750235-bernice", "userReview": "This wonderful poetry book is written in Sijo, a type of poem originating from Korea.

The format is square and smaller than most picture books. Inside, the paper is of good quality and provides a nice gleam to the whimsical illustrations. Linda Sue Park introduces young readers to a Korean form of poetry, sijo. They are short poems that try to end with an unexpected, sometimes funny, twist at the end. The poems provide plenty of material for the Hungarian illustrator, Istvan Banyai. His figures barely stay on the page as they rollick and zoom around. While color does make an appearance here and there, the majority of the illustrations stay in a grey-black-white scheme more familiar to graphic novels than kids books. In color or not, the roly-poly tot that traverses the pages is endearing and sometimes more compelling than the poems. The poem from which the title takes its name is one of my favorites, \"Long Division.\" \n  \"This number gets a wall and a ceiling. Nice and comfy in there.But a bunch of other numbers are about to disrupt the peace---bumping the wall, digging up the cellar, tap dancing on the roof.\"\nBanyai has a bunch of tots swarming over a huge long division symbol that reminded me of a construction crew. Sometimes the illustrations are a bit much for the small page they must occupy. Another favorite poem, \"Important Announcement,\" describes a delicious moment heralding spring, but I must admit, the scene is more apocalyptic than joyous with a giant shadow looming over the bunny rabbits and squirrels. But, overall, the illustrations are excellent. Sometimes, Park's poems get overwhelmed by Banyai's dominating pictures, but I did appreciate most of them. These are definitely lines to be read aloud and not just in your head. Park hones in on the daily life of children and colors scenes with a child's non-linear imagination. There are three ways to explore this book with children: plum vocabulary, searching for the \"twists,\" and going coo-coo for the illustrations.Not for people who like the cutesy end of the kid lit spectrum. Definitely for people looking to put poems in their pockets during April, National Poetry Month."}, {"userName": "Mary Ann", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1610575-mary-ann", "userReview": "Tap Dancing on the Roof is a collection of original poems written in the Sijo style, a traditional Korean form. The poems are funny, but it a way that makes kids think and then laugh. All of these poems have a twist in the last line. Here's an example of one of our favorites in our family:BreakfastFor this meal, people like what they like, the same every morning.Toast and coffee. Bagel and juic. Cornflakes and milk in a white bowl.Or -- warm, soft, and delicious -- a few extrea minutes in bed.(c) Linda Sue Park, 2008.Sijo is similar to haiku, a traditional Japanese poetic form, because they both have a fixed number of stressed syllables in each line. Sijo has 3 short lines or 6 long lines. But instead of focusing on nature themes, like haiku, Siju poems always have an ironic, unexpected twist in the last line. Here's another favorite from the collection:Ocean EmotionThe red flag waves its stern warning:DANGER -- NO SWIMMING TODAY.The ocean churns, foams, roars, dashes,hurles huge breakers at the sand!The next day it's all tired outand takes a long nap in the sun.`(c) Linda Sue Park, 2009.This is a book that will appeal to kids in 3rd through 6th grades.

Each and every poem is a modern English example of the classical Korean form of poetry called sijo. All of them are short, pithy, and end with a twist: think the very best haiku, but about anything(not just nature) and slightly longer. These particular sijo, being written for young readers, were light and funny: my favorites were \"Long Division\" and \"Breakfast\" but they were all good. This would be a great way to share the joy of poetry with little kids, especially for the person tired of the heavy rhythm of a Jack Prelutsky or Shel Silverstein.

Sijo is a traditional Korean form of poetry, almost similar to that of a haiku. Through the flipping of each page students are able to make personal connections to the poems addressed in each poem of the book. The poems write about breakfast, shower, brushing teeth, and even randomly a poem on frogs and souvenirs. An introduction to shijo poems would benefit students of all ages to grasp the basic structure of learning how to write poems.

Sometimes there's rhyming and sometimes there's not. I think my favorite of these was \"Summer Storm\" though \"Souvenirs\" was a close second and many of them were clever.

It is a fixed number of stressed syllables used in three or six lines. Sijo\u2019s are different than Haihu\u2019s because Sijo\u2019s have a surprise ending at the end of them (joke or twist).
