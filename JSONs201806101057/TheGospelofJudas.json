It is not the gnostic gospel of Judas that has actually been found, but rather a scroll that may really date from Judas himself (which the gnostic one does not). It's fictional, well-researched, and rather dark in all time periods that are dealt with. It's really good, but intense and not the easiest read due to some difficult subject matter."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "Mawer, Simon. THE GOSPEL OF JUDAS. (2001). ****. After reading the author\u2019s previous novel, \u201cMendel\u2019s Dwarf,\u201d I decided to read more of his work. This novel was the next one he wrote. It was totally different. Once again, the author lets us know that he has done his research on his topic thoroughly, and proceeds to write in such a way as to draw us into his story. A new discovery of a scroll from the Dead Sea area is made. Although it certainly shows signs of age, it is still reasonably intact and its lines of Koine are still legible. A priest from Rome, Father Leo Newman, is called in to provide translation and interpretation leadership for the scroll. He is an acknowledged expert in Koine. He soon discovers that the scroll appears to be a fifth gospel \u2013 one that tells the story of Jesus\u2019 life, crucifixion and resurrection from the point of view of Judas Iscariot. If the story told by Judas \u2013 the self-proclaimed writer \u2013 is true, it will require a whole new re-thinking of the basics of Christianity. While Father Leo is working on the translation, he is also caught up in a love affair with Madeleine, a married woman. This obviously puts him under severe stress both as a priest and as a man. We also get to learn of Leo\u2019s mother and father and their lives during World War II. The three sets of narratives all merge in the end in the behavior of Father Leo regarding the scroll itself, and the measures he takes to ease its effect on the world. Once again, we are presented with an extremely well-written novel by this writer.

I'm sorry, I just can't bring myself to finish it. A priest has an affair with what appears to be a flibbertygibbit, he gets an interesting scroll in the course of his research, and then as a fallen priest he takes up with a woman who doesn't speak English but models for porn and paints on the side. In both attempts to read this I have yet to get to anything to do with the Gospel of Judas in the manner the book cover suggests, unless it is some oblique symbol of all the betrayals going on in this priest's life. And I haven't the time nor inclination to plough through this to get to it so that the light dawns on me and I understand what all this initial tedium was about. If I want to read about priests having affairs with social twits then I'd go for some bodice rippers who make no pretense about it. As for the GoJ, there were no redeeming aspects to any of the characters, which rendered absolutely no interest in their lives and therefore the book.

The theme of betrayal was returned to again and again, in ways that seemed simultaneously inevitable but also deeply unexpected. The main character, Father Leo Newman, comes from a lineage of betrayal. We see his mother betray her husband with her lover, her lover to the Nazis, and her own identity in order to obtain a new life. The themes of Leo's own role as a betrayer are fascinating. He betrays almost every character, every institution, every principle of belief that he seems to hold. And others betray him in ways large and small. But throughout the entire plot, it never becomes hackneyed; it never seems forced. The plot twists and turns in ways that are still surprising, no matter how well you feel you know the characters and their limits. This is all extremely well done, and very apt.The only reason that I am not rating the book higher is because of the confusing time jumps throughout the narrative. I could not, no matter how hard I tried, get a sense of how much time had elapsed between Leo's affair with Madeline, his time at the World Bible Institute, and his later relationship with Magda. It was disorienting and also distracting every time the story jumped to the (presumably) later frame of time. This section was also the least interesting, the least compelling, portion of the narrative. And the ending of the book, overall, left me wanting. More explanation and less ambiguity as a literary device would have made the conclusion of the novel much more satisfying."}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2796628-erica", "userReview": "A beautiful, intelligent, and moving novel.It's important to remember that this book is a work of fiction. That should be an obvious statement, but I've read several ignorant reviews that indicate that some readers forget what \"fiction\" means.The Gospel of Judas is the story of a Roman priest, Leo Newman, who experiences a crisis of faith at the same time he meets and eventually falls in love with an intriguing yet unstable married woman, Madeleine. Leo is also a scholar who is called to investigate a mysterious papyrus document which could be a firsthand account of Jesus' disciple and betrayer, Judas. It is to this fictional document that the title refers, not to a gnostic gospel that would date much more recently. There are two other storylines: Leo Newman as an older man, embarking on an affair with a strange young student, and a seemingly unrelated story of an extramarital affair between a diplomat's wife and her son's tutor in WWII-era Italy.This novel has been referred to \"The Da Vinci Code for smart people\" which is accurate in a way but not the whole story. The Gospel of Judas is a profound psychological novel that explores the collusion of religious ecstasy and romantic and sexual love and its devastating consequences."}, {"userName": "Teresa Xuereb", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29108146-teresa-xuereb", "userReview": "This novel is extraordinary in the way it combines different themes and different time periods together. A scroll written by the biblical Judas is discovered near the Dead Sea, while on the other hand, Leo Newman, a Catholic priest, is going through the greatest dilemma in his life. He needs to choose between having faith in God and falling in love with a married woman, Madeleine. What will he eventually choose and in whom will he seek comfort? Will his decision be the end of him or the end of her? Will Catholic faith come to an end with the discovery of the gospel of Judas? The novel is very intriguing and thought-provoking because the crisis and the transformation that Leo Newman goes through, reflects how people may react if the Biblical story of Jesus is told from a different viewpoint. The irony is that while studying the newly-discovered gospel of Judas, Leo could become the new Judas of his time."}, {"userName": "Tereza Pec\u00e1kov\u00e1", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5421767-tereza-pec-kov", "userReview": "Asi jsem zklaman\u00e1.

What I got was a priest and his personal life with women...and then some of his translating a scroll on the side. Ugh, the story I wanted was pushed aside to make a moral statement concerning the implications of infidelity and betrayal.The concept of being a \"Judas\" or a betrayer, is a predominant and obvious theme in this novel. The story follows Father Leo Newman in three phases of his life. One in which he is having an affair with a married woman and deciphering a new scroll found to be the gospel of Judas. In another he is no longer a priest, so assuming a future tense, where he is shacked up with a random student he teaches. And then a far past tense in which he is a child (I think) and it tells of the affair his mother had with an Italian man. Honestly, the motivation of affairs and sex was boring and cliche. The idea of resurrection from Leo was confusing, though the idea of betrayal more full formed. Honestly, I didn't connect with any of the characters and I hate a story that is driven by sex alone. I just wanted a dusty manuscript that changes the course of history! Instead I get a confusing rendition of a priest going through several life blunders. Sure, sex makes religion more interesting.

He is simultaneously drawn to and repelled by Madeleine, the middle aged, married woman who seduces him, in a way that struck me as highly realistic. If you had been celibate all your life, with a single unsatisfactory sexual experience as a young man, you would clearly have very mixed feelings about sex, with a generous helping of repulsion mixed in with your lust. This was brilliantly portrayed.The tension between truth and faith also drew me in. Father Newman is a scholar as well as a cleric. He can't deny the apparently genuine nature of the Judas scroll, no matter how badly this upsets his world view and the rocks the foundations of the church.I liked the ending, too, the way that the main character adapts to a world in which everything he cared for has vanished. My quibbles center around two issues: melodrama and the use of language.I want to avoid spoilers, but let me just say that several extreme events occur, events not really pre-figured by the plot up to that point, events that I thought damaged the credibility of the novel. The quiet revelations of the priest's internal life were quite compelling, for me. The plot twists that ensue felt as though someone had inserted exploding cars and tsunamis into an Ingmar Bergman film. One knows at the outset that the priest's affair with Madeleine cannot end well, but the way it actually does end struck me as implausible and overdone.The other issue I have with the book is its overuse of obscure vocabulary. It's not often that I have to stop when reading to look up some word in the dictionary. That was a frequent activity with THE GOSPEL OF JUDAS, to the point that I felt the author was trying to sound erudite, rather than to communicate. It's true that his main character is a scholar, but I found the multitude of the polysyllabic Latinate words disrupted my involvement with the story. Furthermore, when I did consult my dictionary, in at least a few cases I felt the author's use of the vocabulary was inappropriate. All in all, though, I enjoyed this book. I'd love to be able to do as good a job at portraying emotional and sexual ambivalence in my own writing."}, {"userName": "Kamilla", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9926284-kamilla", "userReview": "What a horrible book! What a load of crock! I'm surprised that I persevered and finished it. The story is fictional - not even based on real historical elements, the writing is so bad, that during the first 100 pages I either kept falling asleep or didn't even know what the hell I was reading, what on earth was the purpose of it all, whpere the hell I was, given that the timeline kept changing. I think the first 100 pages could have easily been left out, it still would have made more sense. The story of a priest who seemed to have major psychological issues regarding his faith, his attraction to a married woman, his remblings about how all of these feelings of his are sin, quoting disturbing pieces from the Bible, irritated me to no end. Given the synopsis of the book, I thought this will be interesting since I am drawn towards such subjects. But the book is so badly written that it is hard to read, it only picks up a bit after 100 pages, which is when he finds the scroll. Now this part would be interesting, even theoretically, but the cold writing just ruins it all. It's like reading a running commentary. There is no depth to any of the characters, nothing likable about them, the writing is seriously flawed primitve, ordinary and vulgar. Either the writer has some issues with women in general or he has no idea how to write with literary excellence. I think both, actually. So, if you are thinking about reading this, think hard. You could find many more appealing books on the subject that are brillinatly written. Give yourself a break and don't bother with this one. What a waste of my time!"}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17445290-steve", "userReview": "This book is fairly uneven. There is enough going on with the book before the author introduces a parallel story surrounding the protagonist's mother. I see the point of the side story, but it is weak. The real point of the side story was to make the book bigger. Without it, the Gospel of Judas is a novella. The writing too is uneven. Mostly it is good. I like high brow language, but this author seems to go way out of his way to use words in outdated forms or words that no one ever uses. Maybe my biggest gripe is that the author takes a well known story of betrayal - maybe the classic story of betrayal - and a story that has the mist of uncertainty swirling around it, but does nothing with that uncertainty, in fact uses the uncertainty to be ambiguous about what his characters have actually done. There is a certain beauty to writing around facts and leaving the story that maybe was and maybe wasn't. I tend to think of it more like cowardice, lack of conviction."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2582387-marvin", "userReview": "A marvelously written book about a Catholic priest and early Christianity scholar who gets called in to translate a newly discovered Qumran scroll, a first-century account of the life of Jesus attributed to Judas that undermines crucial aspects of the gospels. The book is informative without being didactic, searchingly devoted to questions of faith without being pious. In dealing at the same time with the main character's own personal crisis of faith and life, it's also an account of the destructive potential of love and faith--no redemption here. Unfortunately, the conclusion is not as satisfying as the development. And it was never clear why another alternative vision of Jesus' life and crucifixion--no matter how radical or how early--should be as serious a threat to the faith as it was presented here. Despite this reservations, the writing alone recommend this book highly."}, {"userName": "Carlotta", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3172936-carlotta", "userReview": "This book was at times fascinating, but it left you without closure on so many issues.

Or I guess that translates to a 1.5 here. This book took an entire month to get through. I kept falling asleep while reading it. It was a great insomnia helper, I'll give it that. Actually, the middle of the book moved at a reasonable pace and the plot was close to interesting. One thing that really struck me was how much the author must hate women. Some of his descriptions of the female characters were brutal, not to mention the fact that they're all cold, calculating bitches who have no self control when it comes to sex.

Already beset by a crisis of faith and on the brink of his first sexual affair, Father Leo Newman must tease out the meaning of this document even as he wrestles with its authenticity and what its revelations mean for him. This is a profound book about loss, faith, redemption, and the possibility of a complete re-interpretation of Christianity.
