I have read several of his books and have admired him and his preaching for many years, so when a friend asked if I wanted to borrow her copy of this book, I jumped at the opportunity! I knew I wouldn't be disappointed, and I was right. I was so impressed by his unswerving faith and how he has let God fight his battles for him especially when things looked bleak. I grieved for him during the loss of his marriage because I was going through a divorce at the same time, and I could empathize with him. The love of his life had walked away from him, just as the love of my life had walked away from me. I was sorry to read of the difficulties he had with his son, Andy, but happy that they seemed able to mend their fences. I could identify with many of the situations he described, and was glad that by giving God complete trust and control, he was able to rise above the strife. And isn't that what God wants from all of us--trust, obedience, and following God's plan for our lives? I'm going to recommend this book to my pastor and all of my friends."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17471200-janet", "userReview": "Tracing the chronology of his life by showing how faith influenced each turn, Charles Stanley gives a clear portrayal of how a life lived in gratitude, submission, and obedience to God can be used for His glory and encourages the reader to follow his example. Dr. Stanley writes, \"I pray that through my life's story, you can see all that the Savior can do through the life of an ordinary person who serves an extraordinary God.\" Throughout the book, Dr. Stanley's unswerving faith and dependency on God in the face of all kinds of trials is truly inspiring."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/657426-chris", "userReview": "A Birthday present from my mom. Perfect timing. God's will for my life is where I want to be. Other distractions are just that. It seems so simple, but it takes practice. So many things demand our attention, while we run around feeling inadequate to do it all. This book reminded me that God has the strength that I don't. He has a plan and a purpose in all things. I trust Him with everything."}, {"userName": "Ronni Aguilar", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67299304-ronni-aguilar", "userReview": "Lean on the Lord, go to Him in prayer for everything, exercise courageous faith always! This is Dr. Charles Stanley's thesis. Reading about his life, the events that propelled him into ministry and the wonderful ways in which the Lord worked in his life was inspiring.

His story is very similar to the apostle Paul. There were many hardships in each's life. Charles Stanley also points out things we should be doing in our lives to glorify God.

Stanley is a man who worked very hard and deliberately towards his unshakeable goals and principles against some pretty long odds coming from his place of entry into the world. The message ultimately is, in my opinion, God has a plan for you, listen to him carefully; don't miss it, act on it."}, {"userName": "Alicia Ruggieri", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24824029-alicia-ruggieri", "userReview": "Charles Stanley\u2019s sermons and walk with God have strongly influenced my outlook on life in general, as I\u2019ve heard him preach since I was a little girl\u2026 My mom listened to his sermons on radio and cassette while she did housework and drove \u2013 such a blessing! (Even if your children don\u2019t seem to be listening, I really believe, from my own experience, that hearing godly teaching is so beneficial to their walk with God as they get older.) So, when I heard that Dr. Stanley was writing an autobiography, I was thrilled. This autobiography was not a disappointment, either \u2014 Like he always has, in his autobiography, Stanley continues to give God all the credit for any \u201cachievements\u201d and continually points his readers to \u201cobey God, and leave all the consequences to Him.\u201d If you are looking for incredible encouragement from a man who has withstood \u2013 by the grace of God \u2013 incredible trials in his walk of faith, pick up this not-too-long-to-read autobiography.

As he walks us through his ups and downs, he shares how the biblical principles he\u2019s taught all his life affected the way he\u2019s actually lived.In this new book from Dr. Charles Stanley, he looks his readers in the eye and says, This is how my faith has worked for me at the most challenging times of my life and how it has led me to the victories God had in store for me. As Dr. Stanley looks back over his long life of ministry, he is now ready to share how his personal faith choices directed his every step. He shares how God walked with him through his most difficult days as a pastor when he faced internal conflict in a church he\u2019d led for years. He gently shares painful family issues that brought him to his knees and taught him to look to God for answers when life wasn\u2019t simple and trite answers didn\u2019t work. Dr. Stanley reminds us that choosing to follow and obey God when life is hard can be both the toughest and best thing we\u2019ll ever do. As Dr. Stanley reflects on the biblical teachings that have led him through his difficulties and joys, he always comes back to this principle: Do what God says is right and leave the consequences to Him\u2014no matter what that means.", "title": "Courageous Faith", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276221-courageous-faith", "average": 4.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1474824329l/27276221.jpg", "reviews": 30, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/39628.Charles_F_Stanley", "name": "Charles F.
