I was not compensated in any other way for this review. All opinions are my own.This book is interesting, but not very good. There's a couple nuggets of story that are somewhat compelling, but the overall lack of editing and polish completely distract from what could be a good story about genuine characters. Rae's heart seems to be in the right place, but she needs to fire her editor, Samantha March.I'm actually really not sure why March is credited as editor unless she contributed to the book so heavily she was almost a co-author but didn't want that credit. There are just so many glaring errors and inconsistencies I'm not sure of what her actual role was. Either or both of them are all mixed up about how to use semi-colons and they're often just tossed into the middle of a \"sentence\" before a simile or the end of a thought that contains no verb. The women talk to each other like paragraphs of a Cosmo advice column. (\"Here are all my thoughts and feelings.\" \"Here are all my thoughts and feelings about everything you just said.\" There's no back-and-forth. It's like conversational precis over and over again.) And the few men act like dudebros with each other but when they're with their women they are ultra-sensitive and nurturing, completely in touch with their feelings, saying just the exact right things all while performing perfect oral sex. The actual plot is thin and super contrived. I would be peeved I didn't figure it out along the way, but there isn't any setup that would allow you to. It's just a few McGuffins followed by a completely incongruous \"reveal,\" which seems to be more about creating tension for the sequel than anything else. To use the gun analogy, every shot was followed by someone noting, \"Oh, by the way, that gun was there all along.\" And then there were the beyond glaring inconsistences-- the character who was introduced as Irish who later says he's from New Jersy. There's a suddenly sprained ankle that is never mentioned until it's time for the hot mister man to pick up the main character. Yeah. I stopped reading back and forth after about four of those, finally convinced I hadn't missed anything. It was just that poorly put together.I did learn a new word: \"anfractous.\" It's an archaic word for \"circuitous.\" And it was so jarring in the middle of this book where the language was otherwise so simple and unstyled that I will never forget it. How do Rae and March come up with anfractuous? How do any of the other eight \"beta readers\" not flag that one?And maybe that's the clue right there. Self-publishing can be a great thing, but I think maybe Hugh Howey spoiled it by being really great. Just because you enjoy writing it and your friends enjoy reading it does not make it mass-market material. I'm a little sad, because Rae wrote \"Sarah, from one southern (at heart) girl to another,\" then put a litte heart in her autograph. So I feel disposed to be her friend. But a good friend would teach her how to use a semi-colon, nix anfractuous, and let her know that an entire page on how Nashvillians call the San Antonio Taco Company \"SATCO\" is just plain incongruous. Also, Lynchburg is not practically a suburb of Nashville. Okay, I have to stop typing now or this will be a (bigger) litany.I tried. I didn't like it. I'll pass on the sequels. I'd recommend you do the same."}, {"userName": "Carly Pollard", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7042501-carly-pollard", "userReview": "Oh boy. I don't even know where to start with this, but I suppose a positive would be good. So, first off, kudos to Karyn Rae for writing and publishing a novel. Seriously. Cranking out a novel is rough, so I applaud her for accomplishing that. But. But, but, but. \"The Achilles Heel\" is so full of grammar, spelling, and word choice errors that I can't even really tell you what the story was about. I honestly spent more of my time reading this book compiling a list of mistakes than actually paying attention to what was happening in the story. When plural and possessive forms of words are consistently getting mixed up, lead is used when led is what's meant (and numerous other similar mix-ups), and there seems to be zero understanding of the correct use of semicolons vs. commas and dashes vs. hyphens, it becomes very difficult to take the writer seriously. That said, it dawned on me, as mentioned in another review, that Karyn Rae credits an editor. I assume that Samantha March must have contributed a significant amount of time to \"The Achilles Heel\" in order to warrant \"Edited by: Samantha March of Marching Ink LLC\" being printed on the copyright page. If that's the case, then shame on you, Samantha March. You did Karyn Rae a grave disservice with your work on her novel. An editor's job is to take an author's draft and clean it up until it sparkles. Samantha March performed her role very, very poorly. I feel like Karyn Rae had a solid idea for a novel but her editor did nothing to make it as good as it could be. Instead, it oozes with mistakes that a professional editor should have easily caught, making it incredibly frustrating to read. Incidentally (and possibly why I'm as irked by this as I am), my career IS that of proofreader and copy editor, and if I let a quarter as much slide as Samantha March did, I'd be out of a job. I really, really hope that Karyn Rae didn't enlist Samantha March's assistance on the second book. Anyway, Karyn Rae, if you want some help on your next book, or would like a list of all the things your unfortunate editor missed so you can spruce up \"The Achilles Heel\" for its next printing, hit me up."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1127405-brenda", "userReview": "This first time author's story involves mystery romance.

Annie Whitman finds herself a widow to a man with secrets. From the moment her husband's car and body were consumed by fire in a one man accident to the pre paid arrangements, followed by the reaction of her brother in law at the will reading and mysterious lockbox and keys that lead her to St Criox. Those secrets came with the price of her husband's life and it is possible that it might come to hers before she uncovers everything that was left behind for her to find. The one thing she didn't count on was finding love on the island.Kessler Carlisle was tired of the music scene and ready to retire. He finds that he wants more from life and heads to a tropical paradise to hide away. There he finds something special, though at first he hides just who he is, and realizes that he wants to make a go at it - but something dangerous is lurking about, hopefully, this won't end before it gets started.I found at times the book was very intense and thrilling in it's writing style, other times (just a few) it lagged. A great story, had me wanting to reach the end. The love story did happen a little too quickly, but the mystery was well drawn out. I think this is just the book to read on the beach on by the side of the pool this summer.*****This is a First Reads, Thank You Goodreads*****"}, {"userName": "Gabriele Pfaff", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23554831-gabriele-pfaff", "userReview": "Laugh out loud funny and bought book III loved all the connected characters Andrea(Annie, Anna), Jake, Jamie, Liz(Elisabeth), Holly, Mama D, Wade, Kessler, Hutch and Annie's girl friends.

I loved following Annie's journey as she searched to uncover her dead husband's secret past. The danger that lurked and the unexpected twists and turns kept me engaged and turning the pages. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that I loved the romance that blossomed between Annie and Kessler. In my mind I pictured Kessler to be a mix between country music stars Blake Shelton and Kenny Chesney ... wow what a yummy combination! I loved the raw emotion, passion, friendship, and sassy banter that made up their relationship, it is a testament of the heart's ability to heal and move on.With a realistic cast of characters who are easy to relate to; witty dialogue and dramatic interactions; and a rich description of the settings; The Achilles Heel is a captivating romance suspense novel that will draw you in with its intensity and drama, and leave you wanting more with its unexpected and surprising conclusion.Disclaimer: I received a copy of the book from the author in exchange for my honest review and participation in a virtual book tour event hosted by Chick Lit Plus Blog Tours.http://jerseygirlbookreviews.blogspot..."}, {"userName": "Samantha March", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4681357-samantha-march", "userReview": "Karyn Rae is on tour now with CLP Blog Tours and The Achilles HeelQuick disclaimer before I start the review: I did work on the editing process of this book.

Thirty-five and failing at life as a widow, she turns to the comforts of vodka in an attempt to camouflage the cold sheets of an empty bed. The necessary inebriation helps her to cope with Jack\u2019s death, but proves to be a deterrent in recovering any sense of normalcy. After spending several months at the bottom of a bottle, Annie stumbles upon a lockbox in the crawl space of her basement. Opening this box also opens her eyes to the likelihood that Jack Whitman might not have been the honest and doting man she married. Annie embarks on a mission to the Virgin Islands to uncover the truth about her husband\u2019s past and seek safety from her brother-in-law, who seems to be the captain of his own sinking ship. While settling into paradise, she meets the wickedly handsome, but surprisingly reserved Kessler Carlisle, who is struggling with his retirement from country music superstardom. With Kessler\u2019s help, Annie discovers the heart\u2019s uncanny ability to heal, and the possibility that dead men don\u2019t always keep their secrets-even if they\u2019re buried in the Caribbean waters of St. Croix. The Achilles Heel delves into the formidable fact that everyone harbors darkness, and some will go to the depths of the ocean to keep their secrets hidden.", "title": "The Achilles Heel", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22025424-the-achilles-heel", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1398849885l/22025424.jpg", "reviews": 35, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8177932.Karyn_Rae", "name": "Karyn Rae"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Business", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22025424-the-achilles-heel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22239234-the-achilles-heel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22008989-the-achilles-heel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24237661-the-achilles-heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39914144-harlow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34997756-state-of-affairs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35100932-the-51st-state"]}
