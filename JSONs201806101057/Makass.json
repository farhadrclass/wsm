That was sort of exciting. Written by a doctor that traveled to a Doctors Without Borders station in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Originally published in an anthology for Doctors Without Borders anniversary. The story is a fictionalized account of a woman who contracts AIDS. The story was good enough, but it left a lot of loose ends for me. Main character points went unexplained. There was a great moment in the book that needed further explanation (is what happened legal? because it sure doesn't seem like it and if not, what were the repercussions?). The ending was so abrupt that I thought I'd missed a couple of pages. All that aside I read the story over the course of a day. It's only about 70 pages long and is certainly compelling enough. Some really fantastic phrasing.I'm hoping someone else reads this, so we can discuss."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7606431-alison", "userReview": "kindle (true story) Africa"}], "description": "In 2010, Dr. James A. Levine was commissioned by Doctors Without Borders to travel anywhere in the world where they have a station and write about the experience \u2013 in an effort to give voice to people who would otherwise have none. The novella was published, along with nine other major international authors, in Italian, in the anthology, Dignit\u00e0, for Doctors Without Borders\u2019 50th anniversary. Dr. Levine traveled to Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo where he visited AIDS clinics and witnessed the remarkable medical care that\u2019s being provided. He almost wrote about that. Until he spent time with some of the people living in the community. There, he met Paulit, an extraordinary woman who refused to be victimized, a woman whose capacity for love will be an inspiration to all. Paulit, through a translator, told Dr. Levine about her life and how she came to live and thrive in this particular community in Kinshasa. Though she's endured unspeakable trauma, Paulit's story is one of survival, hope and the powerful promise of a brighter future. Now, for the first time in English - this is her true story.", "title": "Makass", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20323269-makass", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388180999l/20323269.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1309839.James_A_Levine", "name": "James A.
