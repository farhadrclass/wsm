When she arrives, she finds her betrothed is ill. Not thinking it anything too serious, she gets to know the other people that belong to the Evangelistic Crusade that Eli (her betrothed) has dedicated his life to. When Eli passes away, June wonders if her decision to become a mail-order bride was God's plan for her. Confident that it was, she decides her new calling is to stay on and help see Eli's dream of building a tabernacle dedicated to God realized. When Eli's best friend, Parker Sentell speaks of his displeasure about the tabernacle, June realizes not everyone is as excited about the Reverend Inman and his crusade. June soon begins to spread herself thin working with the crusade, ministring to logging camps in the vacinity, and helping out her friend whose Aunt runs the local orphanage. When the needs of the orphange begins to pull at June's heart strings, she begins to wonder if it is really God's will that the tabernacle be built, or just the obsession of Reverand Inman. When her feelings begin to grow for Parker Sentell she finds herself in a quandry of a different sort.June was an enjoyable book. Though it was slow in places and predictable I continued to read, wanting to know how it ended. This wasn't a fast past book or page turner, but I enjoyed the characters, the setting, and Lori Copeland's easy way of writing."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Meadows", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40096125-elizabeth-meadows", "userReview": "I am really enjoying this series about 3 sisters who answer ads to be mail-order brides.

There was a little more gospel relation in the plot, but there was still the struggle of June trying to find her way in the world and the know what direction the Lord wanted her to go. Like her sisters her journey to becoming a bride wasn't cut and dry. She arrived in Seattle after meeting a wonderful friend, Samantha to find that her husband to be is sick and then he dies. She decides to stay and help to raise money for the Church and then finds resistance with one of Eli's friends, Parker. Parker wants the Reverend to use the money for the orphanage, but the Reverend wants to erect a tabernacle to liken those in England in his wife's memory. June is torn between the two good endeavors and neither one wants to give in helping the others cause. When all things don't go as planned and more problems arise, June decides to call it quits and go visit Faith. She doesn't think there is anything keeping her in Seattle.

Parker begins to notice her more, even takes her on a romantic, moonlet picnic. Then suddenly she becomes angry at him for no reason! He just called her Sweetheart, yet she thinks he has no feelings for her. I don't think this author has a CLUE about her subject! I've read better stories written by 12 year olds!
