From the afterward in the author's notes Herman Wouk sum it all up. \"The purpose of the author in both War and Remembrance and The Winds of War was to bring the past to vivid life through the experiences, perceptions, and passions of a few people caught in the war's maelstrom. This purpose was best served by scrupulous accuracy of locale and historical fact, as the backdrop against which the invented drama would play.\"That is exactly what this author delivered. I started this journey with Herman Wouk asking the question \"What was WWII about?\" He gave the settings and the mechanics so to speak in Winds of War but War and Remembrance was a masterpiece. There was a depth that completely surpassed the first book. It was more thorough, gripping and at times raw. I asked a question and this author told so much. And though it was very lengthy and I at times felt weary with the undertaking of the comprehension of such a piece, I asked, I was curious, I wanted to comprehend and I asked for it. Although my curiosity is more than satiated and I comprehended the story and the information given I must say I will never and refuse to accept explanation for some things. This is a good book and I'm glad I took the time to take it on. 6 stars. It's an undertaking but I do recommend it to all who want to take it on and for those who really want to try to understand a lot more about WWII the Pacific, the European front and the Holocaust. It's not the only account or view but it is a pretty broad one. Personal note:Years ago working in admissions in the Cancer center of a local hospital I registered a man who had a number tattooed on his thick gray hairy arms. I remember behaving with the utmost professionalism but not being able to to stop myself from stealing glances at it. I knew generally what it meant. For his being admitted for a Cancer treatment he smiled, laughed and joked with me a lot. At the end of the registration as I placed an admissions bracelet on this exact wrist he said, \"Deb I survived this tattoo, I'll beat this Cancer don't you worry.\" I don't remember my response now. I don't remember seeing him again while I worked there. But as I read this book, I wondered...about the nice man with the numbers on his arm. I hoped he survived twice. Just something I remembered & shared here."}, {"userName": "Matthew Klobucher", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14494-matthew-klobucher", "userReview": "This review covers both books in this story of World War II,  The Winds of War and  War and Remembrance. Together they follow the experience and growth of Victor Henry, a U.S. Navy Officer, his family, and the many people they meet (American and otherwise) in the great events of that global conflict. As with all great novels, these books are not meant merely to entertain, but to teach and communicate something of the human condition. Here, the auther attempts to reveal the depth of human goodness and evil; to document the human ability to strive, to suffer, to hurt, and to love; and to show the final virtue in individual goodness. I sometimes feel like placid, comfortable lives tend to obscure humanity: there is no need for greatness and no opportunity. This is also dealt with in the story, for though the events of this story take place during a world war, a relatively small part of the book takes place during actual combat. All in all, this is a masterful work, equally attractive to those who enjoy romance and those who enjoy battle. In my mind it stands with  War and Peace as one of the greatest novels of all time."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "[(The Jewish young lady manages to get trapped inside Nazi Germany and set up her emotional adultery as her American love serves on a submarine in the war)....If I want a soap-opera I can watch TV.

It is, along with The Winds of War, the Gold Standard of historical fiction for World War II.Readers should seriously consider reading The Winds of War before reading this book for two reasons. One, the first book in the dualology is a prequel and the understanding the story and the characters makes reading the second book that much more enjoyable. The second reason is to be sure you like how Herman Wouk writes and treats history. Most people do but if you\u2019re one of those ultra-picky readers, you may find his canvas too broad, his characters too perfect and his treatment of historical figures too narrow. If that\u2019s the case, you need not waste your time reading the second book.For me, however, Wouk is a master storyteller and these two books are fantastic. They deal with a period of history that is my passion and I certainly tip my hat to Wouk for his thoughtful and thorough research. For wonderful thought-provoking entertainment and a history lesson all rolled into one, these two books are the best you can get!John E.

I read this before Winds of War which is actually supposed to be first. I would recommend reading them in order, but I do believe that War and Remembrance is slightly better. It's the story of a family during WWII, and you grow to absolutely care about everyone, and really understand all the complexities and personality flaws of the characters. Some are in America, some are in Europe, some feel strongly against Hitler, some aren't sure, some are fighting, some are waiting, some are suffering, some are stuck in Europe, some are in love, some are out of love, some are cheating, some are faithful till the end, some are hunted, some are hunting.

There isn't a more unbelievable, unappealing, sexless \"romance\" than that of Pamela and Pug. Fortunately, a few of the characters I disliked in The Winds of War have redeemed themselves or at least become more interesting and less obnoxious. The only woman who comes off with any growth or dignity is Natalie, and she only ends up that way through unimaginable suffering. Pamela is a pathetic martyr, Rhoda is a selfish, dishonest twit, Madeleine is ignored through most of the book, and Janice turns into a slut (except at the end, when she turns into a frumpy former slut!)Reading both novels back to back, I started out reading von Roon's \"excerpts,\" but ended up skimming them at the end, only reading Victor's notes. I also skimmed the Leyte Gulf chapters as they were technically and historically thorough, but did not contain much plot.

It turns out that I did.Historical fiction, when written well, has a way of creating lasting memories of important events in a way that no text book can. For anyone interested in World War II, especially the war in the Pacific, this is a great place to firm up your understanding of the chronology of events. Especially noteworthy is the Battle of Midway sequence, which is truly a poorly appreciated event during which the future of the world turned on the actions of a very few men and some lucky circumstances."}, {"userName": "Z-squared", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13235258-z-squared", "userReview": "Occasionally I get a craving for something a little different, especially in audiobook format since I share them with my husband. And his tolerance for romance is loooooow. So I stepped outside of my usual comfort zone to give the Winds of War (the preceding book to War and Remembrance) a try, since it's considered to be THE quintessential WWII historical fiction novel. I schlepped through W of W on my daily commutes, alternately bored to death or white-knuckling my steering wheel, and when I got to the end, I wasn't honestly sure whether I wanted to listen to the sequel. Impulsively, I went ahead with the purchase, as much because Audible credits make it a good bargain as from any desire to continue the story.War and Remembrance didn't really improve on the experience of its predecessor. I still enjoyed the sweeping nature of the narrative, the way characters were conveniently flung to the far corners of the world to give the listener an intimate view of mind-bogglingly epic events. I also felt like I got a good education in parts of WWII that were skimmed over or skipped entirely in history class, such as the Paradise Ghetto, the Tehran talks, and the battle of Leyte Gulf. I even enjoyed the long-winded digressions of the fictional German General Armin von Roon. But I found the writing itself to be jarring at times, particularly the wavering between limited- and omniscient-third-person viewpoints. The inclusion of occasional flowery, essay-like passages on the war direct from the author also bugged me. I don't like my opinions spoon-fed to me, I'd rather have characters and plots speak for themselves. It was also very, very clear that the author was writing in the 60s/70s, and some of Wouk's more dour elegiacs weren't nearly as prescient as he likely thought they were. The big downside for me, which will keep me from ultimately recommending this book (and its prequel) to anyone, is how difficult it is to root for any of these characters. Terrible things happen to most of them, and almost all of them bring it all on themselves. The women in particular tend to be vain, vapid, and stupid. The men don't always cover themselves in glory either; even Victor Henry, the paragon of virtue, tends to wallow in indecision at key moments. I slogged through nearly 100 hours of narrative with the hope that at least some of these characters would redeem themselves by the end, but for the most part, I was disappointed. Towards the end, it seemed like Wouk himself started feeling like it was a slog, too. The narrative seemed to speed up, as if Wouk was eliding important character-driven moments and skimming through the last year of the war in the hopes of just finishing the damned thing before being buried alive by it. I guess I'm glad I read it, but I kind of feel like I want 100 hours of my life back, too."}, {"userName": "Carol Storm", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm", "userReview": "I can't resist this book. Every time I pick it up in a library or at a book sale I end up standing there leafing through it for twenty minutes at a time. The only problem is, the only sections I ever read are the excerpts from WORLD EMPIRE LOST by Armin Von Roon, the German general Pug Henry befriends before the war. The strategic analysis and the vast battle descriptions are a lot more real than anything that happens to the characters in the books. Their lives seem to have no reality even to the author himself. Lots of reviewers have mentioned that all the female characters in this book are weak, shallow, spoiled and stupid. What's really disturbing is that there's almost no description of America, the home front, or even the every day experiences of ordinary enlisted men. It's interesting in that these books are consciously patterned after WAR AND PEACE by Leo Tolstoy. They focus on worldwide events and a lot of the characters are actual, historical, movers and shakers. The difference is that Tolstoy could effortlessly conjure up the humanity of a scene -- a peasant girl watching General Kutuzov make plans on the night before the battle of Borodino -- whereas Herman Wouk has no interest in the human dimension of war. He's more like Von Roon than he realizes!"}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3705706-david", "userReview": "I liked Winds of War and I loved reading War and Remembrance. This is a historically accurate book describing WWII from Pearl Harbor until the wars conclusion. It continues the characters and theme of Winds of War with Pug Henry as the primary character who manages to put himself in many of the critical decision meetings and actions for both the Pacific and the European theatres. The action, details and perspectives presented regarding the Doolittle raid, Midway, Guadalcanal and the Battle of Leyte Gulf were excellent. I have read many books on WWII but Wouk made several observations that I had not heard before, such as that the Doolittle raid pushed the Japanese into speeding up the timetable for Midway such that they did not implement their new codes until just before the battle, a crucial reason we knew they were coming. The fiasco in leadership on both sides at Leyte Gulf was an eye opener as well. In Europe, the odd German attempt at control information at the Paradise concentration camp is told along with the gruesome mass killing of Jews at Auschwitz. There are love interests in War and Remembrance that are somewhat less central to the story than they were in Winds of War. As would be expected in a War story, some characters reach there end at the hands of the enemy. It is a tribute to Wouk's character development that the reader feels a loss when these interesting characters meet their maker. This is the best book that I have read in over a year. I give War and Remembrance a must read."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/312691-daniel", "userReview": "This wasn't supposed to be my Holocaust spring. Who needs such a thing? But Bloodlands was on hold for months and months; I finally got it. War and Remembrance was on my cousin's bookshelf, an old mass-market paperback, 1400 pages of pure pulp that I'd promised to read if an easy opportunity arose. By the end my head was filled with battleships and cattle-cars and the sheer brutality of the 20th century; it left me feeling edgy and tearful.Herman Wouk is an interesting writer, mixing history, reportage, and character-driven narrative into a frothy, \"as it happened\" account of WWII. He was a better writer in The Caine Mutiny, certainly; wartime service aboard a naval ship in the Pacific gave his observations a primary reliability rarely achieved in W&R or The Winds of War, and nothing in these latter books impacted me as much as CM's astonishing conclusions on the requirements of service and the nature of command.Still, the \"War\" books have several things going for them. First, they are immensely readable and, where length becomes a burden, skimmable. Secondly, Wouk wrote them late, in the 1970s, and touches upon the dichotomies of American hegemony (Cold War, the middle east, genocide) which came to dominate the second half of the 20th century. As a Jew looking at America, as an American looking at the world, and as a writer looking into himself, Wouk lays out a vast array of material to ponder, and does a wonderful job of getting out of the way.Now I must have a Jane Austen chaser."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/234387-mary", "userReview": "Wouk's earlier THE WINDS OF WAR was a book I tore through, but this sequel I found a bit slower.

I lasted a week and I was back into their lives in this even longer second book. I had come to know and love these characters and I simply needed to know what happened to them all.I did learn the fates of all the family members and a few more besides. I also learned that Wouk did a tremendous amount of research for this book, just as he did with the first in the series, but in this case, he crammed most of it into the story. Wouk did a fantastic job in giving the reader a sense of the absolutely massive scale of this war. His descriptions of the advance of the German army into Russia give you a whole new appreciation for the endless landscape and the sheer audacity and insanity of the assault. And this was just one theatre of the war! Wikipedia tells me that Wouk spent thirteen years researching for the two Henry books and I cannot help but wonder that after the success of the first book his editor was a little lax and allowed Wouk to show all that research. This was most evident in the description of battles which were often recounted from more than one angle and prefaced with expository statements from the author. This made the book feel bloated and endless and not in a good way. I often felt impatient for Wouk to get back to the action! When reading \u201cThe Winds of War,\u201d I really didn\u2019t want it to end and with this I really did wonder if it would.Nonetheless, Wouk tells an amazing story. His characters are brilliant and I cared for each and every one of them. It is my understanding that Wouk moved closer to his Jewish roots as he got older and became more orthodox. This is clear from his focus on the treatment of the Jews in the war. His storyline involving Natalie Jastrow was very well-done and he treats the whole issue with great sensitivity and pathos, making clear how little regular people knew about the activities of the Nazis and the reluctance of the western powers to act on what could be perceived as war propaganda.Another aspect of the story that Wouk did an amazing job on was the plight of refugees. So often in war stories the focus is on the war and not on the impact this has on the civilian populations. Wouk captures the uncertainty, griminess and sometimes terror of civilians travelling in Europe during war time. I read this book travelling cattle class to Australia, a fifteen and half hour trek on one flight and a 32 hour total journey from start to destination and so I found those sections, while in no comparable, particularly compelling.I also really liked his telling of the American involvement in the war. As an Australian who grew up on a history of our country\u2019s involvement in both the first and second world wars from the giddy-up, I have often teased Americans about coming late to the party. Wouk\u2019s story gave me a new appreciation for the American contribution to WWII. The number of America lives lost in the conflict number in the hundreds of thousands, and should not be denigrated, it far exceeds the number of Australian deaths, but pales in comparison to the millions of lives lost in Europe. Nonetheless, America\u2019s involvement ended the war. The American soldiers fought bravely, but it was the industrial might of America that swayed the course of war in favor of the Allies. Wouk\u2019s description of Lend-Lease and the scale-up of American industry after Pearl Harbor is boggling and very impressive. Wouk\u2019s suggestion that Roosevelt long wished to enter the war, but needed to manage public opinion was balanced well with his telling of these backdoor efforts to help the Allies. While I knew all these things, there was something about Wouk\u2019s book that captured the massiveness of it all and what an accomplishment it was. While the teasing is all fun, the western world owes much to America\u2019s effort.I enjoyed this book even though it was bloated. I miss the Henrys now I am done. Unfortunately, it was just not as well written as the first installment.

Perhaps it's because in this book I will finally have some closure and the war is going to finally end... and most of all, I will finally find out what happens to Natalie! I don't think I blinked during the last 10% of the book. My breath was caught in my throat. And I felt light headed after it all came to a wrap. Wouk does a fantastic job describing the family troubles of the Henry family. At times, I felt like I was reading about the characters in my own life. I love that he tries to stay objective instead of black vs. white moralistic through out the book. Even Hitler, the true villain in the book got his share of positive remarks as a person, thus enabling readers to understand at a deeper level, how the German people could have worshiped him so.

One description was so detailed and vivid that it actually upset my stomach and I couldn't eat for a couple of days. But that's what makes this a stunning work as a novel.

Probably too much detail. Then, there is not a whole lot of time devoted to the last 14 months of the war -- as if Herman Wouk wanted to rush the ending. I would have balanced it out a little more.

For them there can be no new earthly dawn. Yet though their bones lie in the darkness of the grave, they will not have died in vain, if their remembrance can lead us from the long, long time of war to the time for peace.\"One of the most beautiful, thought-provoking and important books I think I have ever read. Worth the dedication of reading over 1300 pages (over 2000 if you also include the prequel Winds of War, which is also wonderful and makes this book all the more meaningful). I am truly glad I read this and will be pondering it for quite a while."}, {"userName": "Tessa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4053477-tessa", "userReview": "These two books took me a while to get through, to the exclusion of all other reading, but they were so worth it. What a powerhouse history of World War II. Wouk had an incredible grasp of the geopolitics behind the war, both in Europe and the Pacific. The lengthy battle scenes were not as interesting to me but seemed authentic and were easy to skim over for the gist of the drama. The melodramas of the fictional Henry family sometimes felt inconsequential next to the gravity of the historical events, but they still illustrated well the effects of war on a family, especially a military one. Pug Henry's uncanny way of being in the right place at the right time to experience these great events at times stretched credulity, but he's a good character. Characterizations of Hitler, Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt, were all fascinating and the treatment of the \"final solution\" heartbreaking, with a sense of dread building throughout the books. The books are long, but really essential reading for a layperson's study of World War II."}, {"userName": "Phil", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2935621-phil", "userReview": "Wow! I have been immersed in the pair of these novels for a good few months with the little time I've spared for fiction. A good friend recommended this to me and I was not disappointed. I think all readers can relate to at least one character in the larger Henry family circle. Everyone has their moment of strength and/or glory, juxtaposed against the incredible onslaught of the fascist and incessant evil mania of the Nazis. Although over 70 years have passed since WWII, the power of the endless stories brought out by the best and worst of humanity, never ceases to amaze, disturb and humble me. The fantastic amount of research behind each of these books is evident from one stage of the story to the next, with the reader reliving the war with each of the characters. After finally completing this epic, it was probably two or three days before I stopped thinking about the characters.Highly recommend tackling this mountain of a story if you haven\u2019t already done so."}, {"userName": "Melissa Powers", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11157635-melissa-powers", "userReview": "Absolutely stunning! This is a must read. Continuing the same trend as The Winds of War, this sequel was packed full of historical content. The difference for me was the emotional impact it had. Wouk did a great job portraying the strength and resilience of the Jewish people, even during the most horrific circumstances. I can go on and on about this book, and my love of the Henry family. But the the biggest thing I'll take away is this: the human race is capable of incredible endurance and heroic defiance, and also unimaginable evil..."}], "description": "These two classic works capture the tide of world events even as they unfold the compelling tale of a single American family drawn into the very center of the war's maelstrom.The multimillion-copy bestsellers that capture all the drama, romance, heroism, and tragedy of the Second World War -- and that constitute Wouk's crowning achievement -- are available for the first time in trade paperback.", "title": "War and Remembrance\n      \n          (The Henry Family #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42986.War_and_Remembrance", "average": 4.39, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1422331351l/42986.jpg", "reviews": 738, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9020.Herman_Wouk", "name": "Herman Wouk"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "War", "War", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42986.War_and_Remembrance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386650.War_and_Remembrance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1160461.War_and_Remembrance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8225078-war-and-remembrance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10680257-war-and-remembrance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20877029-rat-i-sje-anja", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13397230-war-and-remembrance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27306965-war-and-remembrance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7663272-war-and-remembrance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21401681-war-and-remembrance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19191494-war-and-remembrance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21484.The_Winds_of_War", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/368772.The_Caine_Mutiny", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14504.Marjorie_Morningstar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42988.Don_t_Stop_the_Carnival", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42989.The_Hope"]}
