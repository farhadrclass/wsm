Language is a key topic in Canada:The land has sixty unique Indigenous language dialects, and, according to census data, more than two hundred languages reported as a mother tongue or home language.It is hardly surprising, then, thatLanguage becomes its own landscape in this issue of Granta. Language falls apart, twists, reformulates, shatters and revives itselfIt is an interesting collection to read. I found the articles translated from French into English to be the most powerful and stimulating and once again found myself wishing my French language skills were better and would allow me to read the original.And thanks to Douglas Coupland for the following quote taken from a short essay introducing a set of images of CanadiannessMy mantra since Brexit has been 'Democracy needs morning-after pills'..."}, {"userName": "Susan Emmet", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3856714-susan-emmet", "userReview": "A phenomenal collection of poetry, photographs, fiction, memoir and so much else. The focus is often on language and Canada is full of languages. How can language capture the nuances of translation, of native dialect, of mixing of old and new (Cajun and French and English), of the wilds, of ancient traditions, of recovery of history, especially that which is unquestionably disturbing.I was especially drawn to the work of Rawi Hage, Douglas Coupland, Kim Fu, Lisa Moore, Naomi Fontaine, Alexander Macleod, Daphne Marlatt, Chloe Savoie-Bernard, Anosh Irani and Larry Tremblay.I think the editors captured the size and scope, the vastness, that is Canada.A wonderful anthology!"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38987378-anne", "userReview": "On the whole I enjoyed this less than some of the most recent editions of Granta. Much of the writing was more experimental than I was in the mood for.

For this reason that experience became symbolic, then relative, that memories receded, that they sometimes altogether disappeared. Forgetting was as simple a defence mechanism as sex, or flight, the evolution of which (as the girl concurred) could be traced back to the very origin of the species...' (Johanna Skibsrud, 'The Rememberer')\"Language, after all, is not designed to either imitate or replace, but instead to _represent_ the objects of our experience. It's a complicated code - purposely indirect. Intended to suggest _affinity_ rather than to reproduce substantial structure.\" (Johanna Skibsrud, 'The Rememberer')\"You draw a line, you put up walls and gates and such, you say some people can't come in and other people can't go out, you say everything inside this country is a certain kind of thing and that's how it is done inside the line you've drawn, you make laws, you have customs and a language, or two languages, or fifty-four languages, it depends. You have a flag, which is a piece of cloth with some sort of pattern on it, and it waves around in the wind. Unlike mushrooms: we don't wave anything. Maybe you have national outfits. You have a special song that you're supposed to sing, it's a ceremonial thing on special occasions. You're supposed to look really solemn and have deep emotions while doing it.\" (Margaret Atwood, 'The Martians Claim Canada')'I've rather come to suspect that our relationship to our mother tongue is not primarily sentimental or emotional, but deeply physiological and that constant and untimely disruptions and repetitive stresses induced by changing language cause what would be called a linguistic neurosis.' (France Daigle, 'What is it that Hurts?')'I sometimes think that I am not much of a writer, lacking the depth often born of tragedy.'

It is the \u201cmagazine of new writing\u201d. Their website describes that \u201ceach themed issue of Granta turns the attention of the world\u2019s best writers on to one aspect of the way we live now\u201d. Founded in 1889 and named after a river flowing near the Cambridge University, it is a quarterly celebrated for its\u2019 themed issues. Although it is categorized as a magazine, it is a really more like a book, an anthology or a collection of stories.Thank you to Louise for sending me this gift. I have enjoyed the first issue with short stories, poems and photo essays by Canadian authors. Edited by Madeleine Thien (Do Not Say We Have Nothing) and Catherine Leroux (The Party Wall), I was moved by the first story, Mangilaluk\u2019s Highway, describing the deadly trek of 3 boys escaping from residential school. One boy survived yet has spent his life wondering why?Lagamorph was a curious tale of a pet bunny submitted by Alexander MacLeod. Parents can relate to the experience of a pet becoming their task and being much more work than initially anticipated. The scene with the snake will be forever etched in my mind!Margaret Atwood submitted The Martians Calm Canada which accompanied an original drawing by the author. Her tale describes Martians accidentally arriving in Canada on their way to a musical in New York. They encounter mushrooms who describe Canada to the extraterrestrials. In true Margaret Atwood style, she comments on the current events through her writing.Granta is a magazine, an anthology really, that shares a unique mix of storytelling by Canadian artists. A few of the entries were very creative head scratchers. I am not sure what to make of them and was happy that they were short but these were mixed in with some great writing.Overall, Granta was a collection of writing to read a little bit at a time, to slowly enjoy and to appreciate the creativity of Canadian writers. I am looking forward to the next collection which is called Animalia."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40763848-michelle", "userReview": "Granta is a literary magazine out of Britain that I was unfamiliar with but picked up when I saw Madeline Thien was one of the curators of a Canadian themed month. Its a collection of short stories, essays and poetry around the theme of what is Canada, what is imagined, here, now. How to share a land etc. What is memory, who decides what stories are told. My favourite pieces included Alexander MacLeod's Lagomorph, Lisa Moore's The Fjord of Eternity, and Johanna Skibskrud's The Rememberer all short stories and Nadim Robert's Mangilauks Highway a beautifully written look at the impact of residential schools on not only the children but their communities. What a great snapshot of Canadian literature.I will definitely continue to search out Granta."}, {"userName": "Wwmrsweasleydo", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6330152-wwmrsweasleydo", "userReview": "Another mixed bag from Granta.

Madeleine Thien's strong introduction in both French and English opens the issue with a beautiful nationalist tone. Then, Nadim Roberts' terrifying, honest, and brutally brave portrait of three Canadian residential school escapees (Bernard, Dennis, and Jack) and the repercussions of the country's decades of coming to terms with its mistakes, missteps, and reconciliations. Margaret Atwood's story about mushrooms communicating with a visitor from space was as beautiful as it was humorous.
