One of the best books I've ever read. This book took me to Radcliffe in the 1950's. All subjects are talked about-nothing is restricted. My favorite thing, is the setting and how real she makes it. Some of these characters are just shallow, awful, and terribly annoying...but it honestly doesn't effect the awesomeness(yea i said it) of this book. Anyone who has missed out on Rona Jaffe- get out and get some. Most of her books are out of print, but available on Amazon for super cheap."}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/174900-autumn", "userReview": "Why doesn't anybody write Rona Jaffe books for our generation? \"I really liked Tesla, then I bought a lot of baby tshirts, then Sept 11, then all my old friends and enemies reunited on Facebook.\" Or something.

Rather, my rating is based on the impression it made on me as a young teen. It was one of the first \"racy\" books I ever read, and also one of the first novels I encountered with gay male characters in the mix. It had a profound influence on me as a reader, and probably as a writer, too...who knows?

WHY is this book not more popular? I loved it, despite the fact that most of the characters are so unlikable- I guess that is one of the reasons that the story is so interesting- you really want to know what crazy mistakes and decisions these absurd people make. Still, some characters are endearing... Also, it's fun to read about such prevalent issues (women's rights, homosexuality, sexuality in general, success, careers, marriage, divorce, children, etc.) through a very 1970s/ early 80s lense."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1715963-christine", "userReview": "This is IMO Jaffe's best book. It follows the lives of four American college girls who get married, have children and meet from time to time.

I LOVED it like crazy. I was so thrilled with the adult subject matter that I had never before been exposed to. Reading the forbidden pages as fast as I could in between being checked on by my parents, coupled with the fact that each page provided shock value, filled me with extreme excitement. I was completely addicted and continuously daydreamed about what might happen in my book and could not wait for the next time I could be alone to find out. I can't even tell you exactly what happened in the lives of the 4 characters. It is my impression, and not necessarily the actual story, that has remained with me all of these years later."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9475-elizabeth", "userReview": "I was reading this book for a Bryn Mawr alumni bookclub. I suppose it was chosen because it is the story of four Radcliffe graduates who return for their reunion. I thought it could be a fun read. It was, however, so dated (it was written in the early 80s) that it was nearly impossible to enjoy and I gave up pretty quickly. If this is what passed from a fun read in the early 80s, I think novels have improved!"}, {"userName": "Renee Rosen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5446595-renee-rosen", "userReview": "I'm taking a look back at this novel for research purposes. I remember this book being all the rage when it first came out and Rona Jaffe definitely sucks you right in and keeps you turning pages whether you like the characters or you don't.

I'm not sure this book would be quite as celebrated if it were published for the first time in today's climate, but I can tell you that this book stayed with me through the years and that has to count for something."}, {"userName": "Kirsten", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/349438-kirsten", "userReview": "I wanted a trashy book, and this fit the bill perfectly. The \"class reunion\" thing is really just a frame for the main action, so the title is a bit of a misnomer. The section set in the 1950s (when they are all at Radcliffe and Harvard) is the most fun - comparing the rules and expectations to modern times. Occasionally the foreshadowing was a bit obvious.

It was very interesting to revisit the 50s and 60s and the lives of college students, what was expected of them by their parents and what they wanted to accomplish - mainly a good marriage for the girls and great careers for the boys.

Epilepsy! Beards! Diaphragms! I loved every melodramatic page, Rona Jaffe."}, {"userName": "Bookish Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24821260-bookish-jen", "userReview": "If you\u2019re looking for a fun, quick, juicy read you can\u2019t go wrong reading anything by Rona Jaffe. Ms. Jaffe is her generation\u2019s Carrie Bradshaw. She chronicled the love lives of women coming of age in the prim and prudish 1950s where gay men were still on the down low, straight men were all cads and women were pretty much expected to go to college and the workplace to find a husband.I must have read my mom\u2019s copy of Class Reunion when I was a middle school, and at the time it was probably pretty salacious to my 13-year-old brain. By today\u2019s standards where any kid can access porn from the Internet, Class Reunion is probably pretty tame stuff. However, it\u2019s also an engrossing, entertaining and page-turning read.Class Reunion follows four main characters during their years at Radcliffe and the years after they graduate. Anabel is a high-spirited and flirtatious Southern belle. Chris is the mousy intellectual. Emily is insecure and eager to please. And Daphne is the campus golden girl. However, all of them have their trials and tribulations like anybody else.Anabel, Chris, Emily and Daphne pretty much arrive at Radcliffe with one thing in mind. Marriage! Sure, they all desire getting an education, but having available men at nearby Harvard is just an added bonus. A Harvard man? Be still my heart!As I mentioned, Class Reunion begins in the 1950s, a time of white gloves and pearls. Women were supposed to aspire to be wives and mothers and they better be virgins on their wedding night! Of course, plenty of people had sexy time before their nuptials. And in Class Reunion a few characters indulge in carnal delights. Anabel, the Blanche Devereaux of the group, is one of the first to have sex, and is immediately branded a whore. And mousy Chris sleeps with Alexander who she later finds out is keeping a deep, dark secret. Emily falls in love with an aspiring doctor, and Daphne tries to hold on to her golden girl status hoping nobody will find out she has epilepsy.All the women do find love as graduation appears. And they believe marriage, children and life in suburbia will be blissful. But of course, following a linear path so in-grained in the 1950s course doesn\u2019t come to fruition. And the upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s definitely affect our heroines. Daphne gives birth to a child with Down \u2019s syndrome. Chris\u2019 husband Alexander is gay. Anabel\u2019s bestie, Max, is brutally murdered. And Emily realizes being a doctor\u2019s wife isn\u2019t exactly a picnic.The Radcliffe grads meet once again at their 20th class reunion. They are older, maybe wiser and try to come to grips of how life has changed for themselves and the world around them.Class Reunion is hardly groundbreaking. And the characters fit into stereotypical female archetypes found in everything from the Golden Girls to Sex in the City. In fact, while writing this I kept thinking to myself, \u201cOkay, Chris is the Miranda. Emily is neurotic like Carrie. Daphne reminds me of Charlotte. And Anabel is totally Samantha.\u201d Still, Class Reunion is the perfect retro chick-lit and a great trashy read.Originally re-published at The Book Self Blog:http://thebookselfblog.wordpress.com/..."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4427991-mary", "userReview": "There are just some friendships and some people you can never forget - even after so many decades. So it was for the Class of 1954 - they went to Radcliffe, and to Harvard in the '50s. It was their golden chance to win everything they ever wanted and to live happily ever after...There was spirited Annabel; romantic Chris; Emily, the perfectionist and the golden girl, Daphne. These four women's friendships - and the relationships that they have with the men who touch their lives - are intertwined, and shaped by their time spent together in college - when they had such wonderful dreams of becoming wives, mothers, career women and lovers. Over the next three decades, in a journey that is at times hilarious and heartwarming - but also poignant and sentimental, these women's lives are changed by events that no one could have foreseen.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. For me, the plot evoked similar memories from my own college experience and how much I enjoyed it. I give this book an A+! I will certainly be keeping my eyes open for more books by Rona Jaffe to read in the future."}, {"userName": "Christine Lowe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26831694-christine-lowe", "userReview": "Fun ReadClass Reunion was written in 1979 and is probably seen as old fashioned by todays reader. The basic story is still good with well developed characters. It's the story of four young women going off to Radcliff to get an education and find a husband. It begins at their twentieth reunion and segues back into their lives as they head off to college. The reader must remember that 1959 is a lifetime away from the freedom of life today. In 1959 it was perfectly reasonable to have a dress code forbidding pants being worn to classes. The students accepted a curfew on weeknights as well as weekends. They also knew they would be punished for breaking the dress code or curfew. Today those rules would be ignored or protested. If the reader can overlook that disparity, they will find good character studies of how women (and men) were expected to conform to the mores of their time and how conforming affected lives.
