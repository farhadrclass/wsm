This installment of the series is great. Kylee is a kick butt diva that comes up with some real zingers even though she is out to get eaten.

This book was the SHIT!!! I definitely was laughing my ass off. Hey K.B. was a certain character based on you by chance? LOL. I mean cotton candy vodka was not a dead giveaway or anything :) best part of the whole story was when Kylee went flying over the airplane seat haha. Oh and a certain famous signing teen who may have possibably had \"beaver fever\" HAHAHAHAHA!!! Although I did find Kylee to be the more reserved charcter, Jade was more brave. Jade also had the whole survival/ killing zombies down pact, almost like she may practice in her basement when she isn't writing? But anywho, enough rambling, everyone NEEDS to read this short story.

Thank you K.B. Miller for this chance to read the amazing book!I loved every part of this story...Kylee is so funny to read and go along with!! She has a strong personality and is very girly, but don't get me wrong she can hold her own when need be... Jade on the other hand is more down to earth and would like to be left alone. They make the perfect best of friends. I have a new found love for high heels :) But feel sorry for Kylee at the same time, when will she catch a break? I know she is strong and can handle it. I have read Jade's version by Jennifer Malone Wright also and I must say I am impressed by both authors.

I loved it!Kylee Mahafferty is a character who is very business orientated. She is comfortable with the pressure and stress of rushing from book conventions to book signings, and back to conventions. However, the stress of fighting off zombies may just break her!I liked her sarcastic and witty thoughts as she observed the world going to hell around her. She is an incredibly brave woman, and she can run in high heels! I can't even walk in them without tripping over something, even imaginary things! She has my respect for that talent!This is a fantastic zombie novella! I'm not a huge reader of zombie novels, but this story is an extremely entertaining read! The story starts out innocently enough, but little did I realise what I was in for! This is one heck of a ride! I read this in one sitting, as the book was extremely hard to put down! The action was quite intense, and there are some scenes that could be disturbing for some readers. I am now looking forward to reading more of these novellas, as I am dying (no pun intended!) to find out what happens next! I'm also looking forward to reading Jade's point of view of the same timeline, which has been written by Jennifer Malone Wright.This series is a collaboration between two great authors, K.B. Miller and Jennifer Malone Wright. Their writing styles are slightly different, but I have a feeling that they compliment each other beautifully. I love K.B. Miller's writing style, as the story flows effortlessly off the page. I was a bit unsure as to whether she could write horror stories, as she had previously only written YA romances, but my fears were unfounded. I am a huge fan of her work, and will read any other books she writes in the future.Due to the violence in some of the scenes, I do not recommend this book for younger readers. However, I highly recommend this book if you love horror, or if you are looking for a change in genre. - Lynn Worton"}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2195441-jackie", "userReview": "2nd POV for same story, Jade's POV was first and now it is Kylee's turn.

This book cracked me up. I adored Kylee and my favorite scene was the fence. I can't wait to read the next book in this series. It highly reminds me of the show Walking Dead although this has much much more humor. The book is wonderfully written and does contain curse words. This is a highly entertaining read that is short novella which is a very fast paced read with lots of action. I love this authors writing and look forward to reading many many more fun and awesome reads. The characters are wonderful. They interact well and their personalities lend to the feel of the story. I just love Kylee's humor through this whole horrible ordeal.

It has moments of laugh out loud funny and moments of horror for those of up with the \"what if\" mentality regarding a zombie apocalypse and being caught without a change of clothes or decent shoes. The world building is fantastic and you have to love the characters, who frankly I wish were my besties. I will admit to having read Jade's story first and I think I liked it a little more. There were a few technical issues with this installment and perhaps a quick reedit is in order. It is a very short read and I really wish there was more, but it is my understanding the series will continue on with more installments to come. As mentioned there are two installments of this same story, each written from one of the main protagonists' point of view and this was Kylee's perspective. I eagerly await the next book in the series and can only hope it will be a little longer with a little more attention to the minor editing issue to feed that need I have for more. I would recommend this book for mature audiences due to graphic violence and language as is stated in the synopsis / description.

I loved every part of it and flew through it. I did think the graphic language warning and violence warning was a bit overkill. I have seen quite a bit more cussing and violence in some YA novels. But oh well. :PI definitely loved that this one took place mostly in a plane. Yes, I have read quite a few zombie books but never have I had one that took place in a plane. On the airport, yes, but an actual real flying in the air and oh boy you don't want zombies there plane? No. So I was definitely delighted, and creeped out. Would our girls survive this, because when stuff goes to hell, stuff goes to hell real fast and real horrifying. It was definitely a bit standard, it starts of with peace and quiet, just a few hints here and there that something might be up, that something will go down. People coughing, people half-vomiting, people acting a bit weird, not getting a connection to loved ones. But I really love it when that builds up to a good zombie. :PIt was a bit sad that the blurb already spoils how the zombies came to be. That wasn't mentioned until the last few pages of the story.The two MCs, or well, I do call them that though Kylee is the one we follow on this crazy ride. I loved both of them to bits. They were just so kick-ass. Nothing like how some people are during the zombie apocalypse, with these 2 we might just stand a chance. Unlike most people who would just try to restrain a zombie even when it is clearly not going to stop eating and munching, Jade just tackles zombies left and right, and even Kylee is getting into it quickly. They really saved a lot of people that day, though I do wonder how many will survive in the end. :(Cheri was a nice addition to the story, and I can't wait to see how she will survive. She got 2 kick-ass ladies helping her out, so I am sure she will be able to survive.I will check out Jade's story in a bit, and then see if I can find the second book. I am quite sad that I can't find anything further than book 2. I did find a cover reveal for the third book, but that is over 3 years ago. Such a shame if this series never got any further than book 2.I am glad I decided to go for this book, the blurb definitely pulled me in, the cover just said NOPE to me (sorry if that is harsh but I love a good book cover and often get turned away if a cover is just meh/bleh/urgh). I would recommend this book to everyone. It is short, quick, but full of zombie action, kick-ass characters, and much more.Review first posted at https://twirlingbookprincess.com"}, {"userName": "Diana Blick", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3287532-diana-blick", "userReview": "FunThis one was as much fun as Jade's perspective.

I am not a fan of zombie books, but this was surely a treat. With a nice blend of kick ass zombie moments, funny adult humor, and real life anguish. Each character has their own traits that are a perfect duo that balance each other out on their venture back home to their families. *Now I read both Jade and Kylee's stories, and personally I feel that there was no real need for both. There were only slight changes in each story that I feel could have all been placed in the same book and still had the same affect. You get a little more insight to each characters feelings over what is happening, but the story line is the same as the other. It when reading the 2nd story, I just wanted to skip around till I found something different that I had not seen in the previous book, as I am not a fan of re-reading because I already know what happened and it just spoils it for me.* Just my opinion, and my only reason for rating it a 4 instead of a 5."}, {"userName": "Markus W", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17203306-markus-w", "userReview": "[\"Shit, I hoped we were on the tarmac\"  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tanya Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17382369-tanya-johnson", "userReview": "Jade and Kylee are authors who are on a book signing trip.
