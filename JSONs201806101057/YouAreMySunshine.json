I had no clue it was a book until I walked into Barnes and Nobel and saw it with my own eyes. It\u2019s a literal take on the children\u2019s song that we all know and love. Little children hold onto their teddy bears and sing them the song. I had never pictured the song to be about a child singing to their toy but it is a darling little book.\t Something I really liked about this book was the way the text was laid out. Because we want to sing it when we read it, it is laid out in a way that makes that possible. The words flow in waves on the page and swirl around the illustrations for a fun reading experience. Sometimes the text stands out boldly against the pages, while other times it calmly stays in the background and lets the picture speak of itself. The cover is a perfect example of how the words fit around the illustration! \tAnother thing that really caught my eye in this book were the illustrations. The children with huge heads and little smiles are adorable to me! The bears also have huge heads and little facial features, which I just can\u2019t get over. I think the illustrator\u2019s style was captured perfectly in this book, but at the same time the illustrations are not distracting from the text or song as a whole. Rather, they add to the overall experience of the book and make it a great children\u2019s book for all ages."}, {"userName": "Rachel Kinney", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63912834-rachel-kinney", "userReview": "I chose this book for one of the baby and toddler books. I love reading this story to babies and toddlers because it is short enough that it keeps their attention. The pages are also shiny and bright with pictures of a young child that they love looking at and the book can be sung as well as read. This is an adorable story to enjoy with children. The children also love just looking at the book."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3434680-emily", "userReview": "This book was excessively cute, but in this case excessive was a good thing. I loved the board book style that makes it so easy to read with toddlers. The illustrations were also very adorable. The pictures, plus having the words of the song written on the page make this book a fun learning activity. I can definitely see myself reading this with me kids."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8164191-maureen", "userReview": "This simple board book is a good companion for the song \"You are my sunshine.\" The words follow the lyrics of the song exactly so a caregiver could sing or read the story. The pictures are simple and appealing to toddlers. Each 2-page spread shows a different child with their favorite stuffed animal. A very sweet, but simple book for caregivers to share with their little ones."}, {"userName": "J", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7189810-j", "userReview": "What a lovely book.

Awards: Jimmie Davis was awarded the Grammy Hall of Fame for this song2. Grade Level: Preschool to Kindergarten3. Summary: This song book expresses the love someone has for another by comparing them to sunshine. The illustrations explain the song through a child\u2019s love for his/her stuffed animal. The children are shown cuddling, playing with, and falling asleep with their stuffed animal. 4. Review: Calling someone sunshine is such a beautiful metaphor because the sun is one of the brightest and warmest thing in existence. The illustrations are child-friendly which makes the song book relatable to children. It is a warm song that any person at any age would love. 5. Possible In-Class Use: Children could create their own stuffed animal out of paper. They could cut out each part of the body and glue them together. They would cut out the head, body, arms, legs, nose, ears, eyes, tail. Once they are finished putting it together, then they can glue it onto a stick. This activity fosters creativity, imagination, motor skills, and they can practice making shapes the same size. Another in-class use, which also can tie to the previous activity would be to have the children sing this song as a chorus holding their sticks with their animal of choice. Their family and/or friends can come and watch. There would also be snacks and drinks for the audience. This allows children to gain comfort in the classroom with each other and builds a bond with the children\u2019s families to get everyone together."}, {"userName": "Krista Lockwood", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64729818-krista-lockwood", "userReview": "Awards- noneGrade- Pre-KThis book is a great book for young children. The children in the book are showing the reader how much they love their teddy bears. The book is short but it is heartfelt. The book is a hard cardboard that is durable for young children. The song that goes along with the book is catchy and very simple, which makes it easy for young children to learn quickly.You are my sunshine is a wonderful book to read to a child that you love and care for. The illustrations are well drawn. This book can be relatable to little children because they may have a stuffed animal that they love and care for very much and they may sing the song to them. In the classroom this book can be read and sung to the children before nap time in a preschool or daycare. It can be nice a relaxing for them to calm down and sing a song. Another classroom activity is to have each child draw a picture of something or someone that they love very much after reading the book as a class."}, {"userName": "Rachel Devine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59439036-rachel-devine", "userReview": "1) Awards: None 2) Grades Preschool 3) This book has the chorus to the song \u201cYou are my sunshine\u201d with pictures of children and their teddy bears.4) I like this book because it is simple. It has simple pictures with little to no background detail and simple depictions of the children and their teddies. It is a board book with thick pages which is great for small hands to turn. 5) This book is great for small children, in class it can be used with the song or with just the teacher and class singing the chorus. It can help children see the connection between the words of the song and the words on the page. It can also help to talk about emotions and make connections between self and text. The song talks about being happy and how someone in their life makes them happy when they are sad."}, {"userName": "Schuyler", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27341354-schuyler", "userReview": "If you like to sing to your children, this is a good book to sing to them.

I love this illustrator. Each page spread shows an adorable young child with a special lovey toy. This book can be read as the reader (most likely a parent or other loving relative) expressing her love, or as the children expressing their love for their special toys. I liked that idea. I read this hoping to find another book by this illustrator to use as a special birth day book for my second child, but I felt this wasn't specific enough like How Do I Love You? and I Love You Through and Through are. Might change my mind though. I did about the former and have greatly enjoyed reading it with Natalie."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7120170-sarah", "userReview": "Maybe I am missing something here.We all love the \"You Are My Sunshine\" song, so that's why I got this book.
