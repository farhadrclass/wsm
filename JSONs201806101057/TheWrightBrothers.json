The Wright brothers were very careful to document each stage of their development not only with photography, but also with journals.\u201dThe best dividends on the labor invested have invariably come from seeking more knowledge rather than more power.\u201d Wilbur and Orville WrightThey were brothers.As close as two peas in a pod and you could make it three with Katharine, the little sister who also at times provided the role of mother and first wife to flight. (neither brother ever married) There were two older Wright children, both boys who lead fairly normal decent lives. They grew up in a more traditional home with the mother and the father, but by the time the three younger children came along their mother was not alive to raise them, and their parson father was travelling extensively trying to build up followings in churches all across the nation. Orville dropped out of high school to start his own newspaper. Wilbur soon joined him. It became the first of many alliances between the brothers, though claiming not to be very good at business, their resume shows something quite different. Despite how close they were their devotion to one another was not always based on harmony.\u201dWilbur...believed in \u2018a good scrap\u2019. It brought out \u2018new ways of looking at things,\u2019 helped \u2018round off the corners.\u2019 It was characteristic of all his family, Wilbur said, to be able to see the weak points of anything. This was not always a \u2018desirable quality.\u2019 he added, \u2018as it makes us too conservative for successful business men, and limits our friendships to a limited circle.\u2019\u201dIf you have strong family ties your need for an extended circle of friends certainly diminishes. Sometimes family does not provide friendship and many of us have to find that solace elsewhere. As I always told my kids it is better to have one really good friend than an extended circle of \u201cfriends\u201d. Those \u201cfriends\u201d may believe that they are your friends, but I\u2019ve found when the chips are down those \u201cfriends\u201d suddenly become \u201cacquaintances\u201d and sometimes very distantly so. The Wright Brothers may have fought vigorously with each other, but each was a sounding board for the other to clarify their thinking. A good battle would often have them getting together the next morning with each brother switching to the other\u2019s opinion creating yet another skirmish as they tried to prove the other right. When the bicycle craze began, the brothers were on the leading edge by opening the first shop in Dayton to repair those bicycles. It wasn\u2019t long before they decided they could make a better bike and in the basement of their shop they started making bikes to order. They named them Van Cleve (launched 1896), after an illustrious ancestor of theirs who helped settle Ohio. They were successful business men yet again. Wilbur first turned his thoughts to flight. He may have followed Orville\u2019s lead into the printing business, but this time Orville was following after Wilbur. It was a true partnership and like the Paul McCartney and John Lennon alliance they took equal credit for all that they created. First in flight was plural. They flew!\nOrville on the left was always a bit more dapper than Wilbur on the right. Here they are on the Wright Flyer 1 in 1910.I\u2019m not going to go into the trials and tribulations that lead to the first powered, controlled flight of an airplane on December 17th, 1903. You\u2019ll have to read the book to find out those details. I will say I was surprised at the length of the process. I thought that after 1903 they were lauded and celebrated, but it actually took much longer than that for the world to take notice of exactly what they accomplished. The French showed much more interest than the American government which was a source of disappointing to the Wright Brothers. I do wonder if H. G. Wells, with his creatively conceived books of the future, was already contributing to the French fascination with flight.In a reversal of roles from what I expected the Americans were sceptical while the French felt that anything was possible.It was interesting to me that the venerated Samuel P. Langley of the Smithsonian was competing with the Wright Brothers. He had raised over $70,000 in funds to build his airplane. The Wright Brothers in comparison spent $1,000 building their airplane using only funds raised from profits from their bicycle shop. We do not celebrate Langley as the first to fly so you might be able to ascertain that his expensive prototype did not fly. As the Wright\u2019s heard about the progress of their competitors it never bothered them. They had a vision of where they had to get to and never wavered from their intended course or worried about whether someone else would fly first. \u201dIt wasn\u2019t luck that made them fly; it was hard work and common sense; they put their whole heart and soul and all their energy into an idea and they had faith.\u201dThey built a concept out of a garage before America even had garages. If Steve Jobs were alive today and had read this book he would certainly have identified with the ability of the Wright Brothers to take an idea and refuse to let it go. One thing we know is that all over World there are people tinkering in their basements, garages, and on their living room floors. They are taking wisps of ideas and turning them into reality. As they drive to work, as they sit at a desk at work, as they turn a bolt on an assembly line, they are dreaming about contributing something new to humanity. \nWalking in tandem.The Wright Brothers did become wealthy, but certainly not as wealthy as they could have if they had been showmen or if money had really been the be all and end all of learning how a man can fly. They were focused on the HOW, fame and fortune would take care of itself. I couldn\u2019t help but admire them and be inspired by their bred in the bone entrepreneurship that took them from a printing press to a bicycle shop to conquering the sky.\u201dOn July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong, another American born and raised in southwestern Ohio, stepped onto the moon, he carried with him, in tribute to the Wright brothers, a small swatch of the muslin from a wing of their 1903 flyer.\u201dTo see all my book and movie reviews visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.com"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "\"The Wright Brothers\", by David McCullough, is FANTASTIC!!! I was 'hooked' instantly listening to the audiobook! Soooooo Good!!!!!!I was immediately inspired by Wilbur, Orville, and their family values. Their dad was a Bishop. There mother may have been shy but was a gifted 'fix-it' woman. There wasn't anything around the house that broke, that she couldn't fix. Wilbur and Orville credit their mother for their engineering talents. Don't you love it that these terrific guys credit their 'mother' for their creative curiosity and abilities?/! Their father, a Bishop, encourage reading in their family. Go dad! There wasn't indoor plumbing -- but there were many books in the house. If any of the children felt like staying home from school for a day, to stay home and read a book, it was alright with their father. I couldn't get over the 'life-changing' story about Wilbur when he was smashed in the face with a hockey stick by a neighborhood bully. Something about that story- ( his original plans for college changed instantly)...stayed with me (deeply), while engaged listening to the rest of this novel. I'm soooo moved by these brothers and their accomplishments. This is seriously a fantastic book about two brothers - a sister - a mom - a dad - their integrity - from family - to business - their passions - their sense of humor - hard work - determination & dedication- - fascinating mechanics of aviation ( fly like birds), ...the historical moments were exciting. The magnitude what they manifested....is miraculous. I've been 'nutty-excited' about this book -- (a chatter-box to my friends) --for days!!! Many details moved the hell out of me. ( and will move you too). Just think -- their work began in the little town on Kitty Hawk...( they slept in tents, shared a community with the mosquitos, and cooked their food over the open fire).An outstanding enjoyable book about two brothers who became a world sensation. (with heart-connecting side stories)As for the author,.....David McCullough, .... he is *Viva-la-TERRIFIC*!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "This is a gem of a book. McCullough is one of my favorite history writers, and I think The Wright Brothers is one of his best works.Wilbur and Orville Wright make for a fascinating story. Born in Dayton, Ohio, the brothers were so clever and mechanically gifted that it seemed they could fix or create anything. They became interested in human flight at a young age after playing with a toy helicopter, made from just a stick and some rubber bands. The guys read everything they could about flight and they studied birds obsessively, understanding that birds had a natural design that should be emulated.McCullough tells stories about the boys' childhood, their strong relationship with their father and sister, their early attempts at gliders and flying machines, those famous first flights in 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and finally of their international fame and travels. My favorite stories were about how intelligent and determined the brothers were. They never seemed to give up hope that they would one day solve the problem of human flight. They kept modifying and improving their flying machines, and even after several crashes, the brothers insisted on continuing to fly. They never seemed afraid to go up in the air.McCullough had access to hundreds of letters and diaries from the Wright family, and those passages were especially illuminating and enjoyable. In the acknowledgments, McCullough praised the Library of Congress for its collection, and wrote: \"In a day and age when, unfortunately, so few write letters or keep a diary any longer, the Wright Papers stand as a striking reminder of a time when that was not the way and of the immense value such writings can have in bringing history to life. Seldom ever did any of the Wrights \u2014 father, sons, daughter \u2014 put anything down on paper that was dull or pointless or poorly expressed. And much that they said to each other, and only to each other, was of great importance.\"I knew little about the Wright brothers before reading this book, and now I'm so keen on them that I want to visit that famous beach in Kitty Hawk, and to see the museum that has their bicycle shop, which is where they did so much of their inventing.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history or aviation. Favorite Quotes\"From ancient times and into the Middle Ages, man had dreamed of taking to the sky, of soaring into the blue like the birds. One savant in Spain in the year 875 is known to have covered himself with feathers in the attempt. Others devised wings of their own design and jumped from rooftops and towers \u2014 some to their deaths \u2014 in Constantinople, Nuremberg, Perugia. Learned monks conceived schemes on paper. And starting about 1490, Leonardo da Vinci made the most serious studies. He felt predestined to study flight, he said, and related a childhood memory of a kite flying down onto his cradle.\"\"Orville's first teacher in grade school, Ida Palmer, would remember him at his desk tinkering with bits of wood. Asked what he was up to, he told her he was making a machine of a kind that he and his brother were going to fly someday.\"\"On July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong, another American born and raised in southwestern Ohio, stepped onto the moon, he carried with him, in tribute to the Wright brothers, a small swatch of the muslin from a wing of their 1903 flyer.\""}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "THE WRIGHT BROTHERS. (2015). David McCullough. ***.Even a writer as fine as McCullough couldn\u2019t bring any excitement to the page in his attempt to chronicle the lives of these two brothers who brought the science of aviation to its ultimate realization. These were two boring guys. They were dedicated to their goal, and followed the precepts of their father to the word while on the way there. You can\u2019t belittle their achievement, but following their steps to reach it soon becomes boring. There is never a surprise on the next page. One of the steps to their success, however, was pretty much minimalized: the obtaining of necessary data using a self-designed wind tunnel. That instrument allowed them to obtain the data they needed to design and optimize their first planes. Without those data, they would have been \u2018flying blind.\u2019 Other men were working on achieving flight at the same time, but all the rest of them had to rely on trial and error in the design and building of their crafts. Although well written, Mr. McCullough was still dealing with sliced white bread as his subject. When I finished this book, I felt that I really didn\u2019t know anything more about the brothers. I felt, instead, that I had just finished reading the outline of a Boy Scout\u2019s manual."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "I don't read a lot of non fiction , but I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to read this book which tells the story of how two men changed the future. Having read David McCullough's John Adams, I knew that I would get an education at the very least .Two of the chapter titles so aptly reflect what Wilbur and Orville Wright were all about - \"The Dream Takes Hold\" and \"Unyielding Resolve\". Their ingenuity, perseverance, thirst for understanding of the scientific aspects of a flying machine was fascinating even I don't understand aerodynamics. They were in the printing business and the bicycle business before their attempts to fly . They read books and pamphlets and studied birds and what others before them had attempted and worked on for years . \"A friend told Orville that he and his brother would always stand as an example of how far Americans with no special advantages could get ahead in the world.\" Orville responded \"But it isn't true to say that we had no special advantages ...the greatest thing in our favor was growing up in a family where there was always much encouragement to intellectual curiosity.\"What was missing for me was a little more of the personal . McCullough does give a glimpse of their childhoods and their family relationships with their father and sister and the encouragement, but it was hard for me to connect with them on that personal level. In spite of that, it was a compelling read to see their progress and ultimately what they achieved . Those interested in life changing historical achievements , in aeronautics or are fans of David McCullough will enjoy this book. The meticulous research that is that hallmark of this great historian is evident in the numerous source notes and extensive bibliography . Thanks to Simon & Schuster and NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "A beguiling tale of how a rather ordinary pair of brothers invented the first successful airplane and thereby changed history. A wonderfully told story with a lavish picture gallery that I think most readers could appreciate. It leaves you with the illusion that if you have enough persistence you might achieve personal ambitions of your own that could prove important. Yet they have some combination of the \u201cright stuff\u201d at the right time and the right place that appears to be quite special and not easily replicated. McCullough does a great job in laying out these qualities and circumstances and conveys the wonder and magic that lies between the ingredients of a recipe and the kind of creation achieved by a master chef. The setting of the Wrights\u2019 origin is the industrial town of Dayton, Ohio, at the turn of the 20th century, which is blessed with a congenial combination of working and middle class families. Wilbur is 4 years older than Orville, but they are inseparable. Their father is a Protestant minister who takes over the management and editing of a national newsletter of the denomination. Their mother dies when they are young, leaving their older sister Kathleen to run the household. The family environment was very supportive of the brothers to fulfill whatever life they might seek. Calvinist moral principles of hard work, humility, and modesty prevailed, but strong expectations about religious practice were not enforced. Wilbur was accomplished in math and science in high school and might have gone to Yale if he hadn\u2019t gotten laid up for a long time by a hockey injury. Orville was more playful and less studious, but he had ambition enough to start a local newspaper after high school. When that failed, he and Orville start a bicycle repair shop which advances to a small production operation. Kathleen goes to Oberlin and takes a position as a high school Latin teacher after she returns to the household.Orville and Wilbur, inseparable as twinsWilbur plants the seeds of their journey by sending away to the Smithsonian Institute for literature and resources about the science of flying and history of attempts at human flight. He was always fascinated by nature and curious about the methods by which birds achieve that capability. Their new hobby becomes fooling around making kites and gliders just for fun. Orville is engineer enough to conceive of a mechanism to change the shape of the wings and thus control lift. He seeks a setting where they have steady winds and a flat place without trees for safe testing of their evolving glider models. That\u2019s how they ended up setting up a summer camp at Kitty Hawk on a sandy island of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks. Their limited financial resources and the challenges of weather, mosquitoes, and remoteness of the setting called for much sacrifice to attend to their obsession. Only a few members of the remote fishing community witnessed their early successes with gliders in 1990 and 1901. Orville\u2019s correspondence with another enthusiast, Octave Chanute, a civil engineer in Michigan successful in hang-glider innovations, led to an invitation to give a presentation of their glider work at an engineering society in Chicago, which was the first step to outside knowledge of what they were beginning to achieve.The instabilities in control their craft made Orville lament that they were 1,000 years from safe controlled flight. Their designs were hampered by inaccuracies in the equations to predict lift and drag. Orville led extensive efforts back in Ohio to use a homemade wind tunnel to make measures for various wing shapes, which led to better wing designs. With the added invention of the first moveable vertical rudder they achieved controlled glider flight (i.e. with turns and landings) in 1902, and, in 1903, with the addition of a motor and primitive props they accomplished the first well controlled flight of fixed-wing motorized airplane. Lateral roll was controlled by wing-warping, pitch (up and down motion) by a forward elevator, yaw (side to side)by the rear rudder. That sounds so fast, but it belies the thousands of launches they made, numerous failures and modifications, and occasional disastrous and costly crashes. They lucked out in having access to a gifted mechanic in their bicycle shop, Charlie Taylor, who devised and machined a lightweight gasoline engine to power their craft. Controlled glider flights like this one by Wilbur at Kitty Hawk in 1902 represented the big breakthrough in airplane development. I am impressed with the craft's elegant design. Somehow they took a licking and kept on ticking. Their particular teamwork in thinking seems to have been critical for their successful problem solving, the way they challenged each other, thrashed out positions in argument, then ended up persuading each other to move toward alternative viewpoints. The special skills they developed as pilots was almost as important as the technology for their long range success. That the two remained bachelors, a mystery in itself, contributed to their long range focus. Media coverage was minor, and the world at large remained ignorant of the milestones they made. Their 1903 patent application was rejected. McCullough provides tantalizing clues to their amazing perseverance: What the two had in common above all was a unity of purpose and unyielding determination. They had set themselves on a \u201cmission.\u201d\u201cThe strongest impression on gets of Wilbur Wright,\u201d an old schoolmate said, \u201cis of a man who lives largely in a world on his own.\u201dWilbur also, it was agreed, had \u201cunusual presence\u201d, and remained imperturbable under almost any circumstance, \u201cnever rattled,\u201d his father was proud to say. All this is only half the story. McCullough\u2019s narrative makes an equally fascinating tale out of the years of effort it took the Wright brothers to create and demonstrate practical models, garner widespread appreciation and understanding of their accomplishment, and attract financing for commercial production. In a field outside Dayton, accessible by trolley car, they devised a derrick catapault and tested models that could accommodate a sitting pilot instead a supine one, turn in good control, and stay aloft as long as fuel permitted. Lots of people came to witness their feats, but what little local media coverage they got was distorted, and their success was disbelieved by the authorities that counted. The first accurate accounts were made by a beekeeper they befriended in his column in \u201cGleanings in Bee Culture.\u201d Meanwhile, other aviation pioneers had some disastrous failures, including a killing crash by a French glider innovator and well publicized crash of an expensive, publicly funded attempt by the Smithsonian Institute on the Potomac River.The Wright\u2019s tried and failed to get the U.S. Department of War interested in a demonstration and sale but succeeded with government and private industry representatives in France. McCullough creates a great perspective for abstemious Wilbur travelling in style to France by a Cunard line ship, a stay at a first class hotel in Paris, and presentation of a convincing business case to investors and government military representatives. Though shy and prone to avoid public speaking, he was amazing in his articulateness and capabilities in expressing himself in writing. Money, power, and class did not impress him as much as competence and honesty. A hefty offer of a sale was rendered pending successful demonstration that met certain performance standards. However, the official aviation club snubbed him and cast doubt and insults in the media.Orville remains quite a cipher as state of mind and feelings in this period can only be read between the lines in his terse letters home. McCullough, who has written another book about the charms of Paris, spends some time reflecting on his choices for leisure activities while there. Instead of monuments, festivals, night clubs, it is the gardens, opera, church architecture, and art museums which he most appreciated. A bit of a surprise to some for this provincial small businessman with a high-school education. He succeeds in securing a racetrack in Le Mans for a demonstration site, but he has to do a lot of engineering to repair and replace the plane after it arrives terribly damaged in its shipment. The demonstration amazed thousands and garnered full accolades from world media and the doubtful community of aviation peers and competitors. Orville initiated a parallel process of demonstrations at Ft. Myers, Virginia. Despite overall success, a prop failure led to a terrible crash which crippled him and killed a lieutenant assigned as passenger on the flight. After the family recovered from the disaster, more demonstrations in France, England, and Germany were pursued, a patent was awarded in 1906, and many lucrative contracts ensued. Ideas for use of planes grew fast, with postal delivery and military reconnaissance among the first. The dream of humans conquering the flight of birds was fulfilled, and the harnessing of air travel for innumerable benefits was at hand. An uplifting and human story told well. Kind of makes one proud to be human and to appreciate the American capacity for ingenuity."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "How did two brothers without any funding or engineering education become pioneers in aviation? David McCullough answers that question in his superb book, \"The Wright Brothers\". Wilbur and Orville grew up in a family that loved learning. They were also very intelligent, focused, persistent, and hard working. The brothers owned a bicycle shop, possessed exceptional mechanical ability, and designed their own bicycles. They were interested in flight, and gazed at birds for hours to study how wings were tilted to catch the air before they set up their first experiments. They had caught the spirit of invention that was prevalent in America at the turn of the century.In 1900, they flew their first glider which was funded from sales of their bicycles. In 1903, the first motorized plane carrying a pilot was flown on the sandy Outer Banks of North Carolina. The brothers not only built the plane, but also had to build a shed for storage and housing, and dig a well to obtain fresh water. They faced dark swarms of mosquitoes, sandstorms, and freezing temperatures in the Outer Banks. They risked their lives, and Orville was seriously injured in 1908. France was the first country to embrace the Wright brothers, and a good portion of the book is about their work there.The book includes many photographs, and quotes from letters from the brothers to family and others. In addition to being a good historian, author David McCullough is also an exciting storyteller.

I have yet to read a book by this author that doesn't make history fascinating. Aeronautics isn't a topic that draws me, but McCullough had me thinking about the miracle of flying. He had me observing birds with a different eye.This is a relatively short book. That covered is that which a \"normal reader\" will want to know. There isn't a whole lot about the Wright Brothers' childhood, neither the patent lawsuits that arose after their accomplishment was a fact. The central focus is the years between 1899 and 1912, and how they came to be the first to ever fly. 1912 was the year of Wilbur\u2019s death, and I am not going to tell you more about that. The book briefly skims major life events of all family members through to their respective deaths. Orville died in 1948. The wide scope of advancements in aeronautics is scarcely even mentioned. The focus is Orville and Wilbur's flying achievement. You get a detailed picture of their world - in Dayton, Ohio, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina and in Paris and Les Mans and Pau, France. Wilbur spent almost an entire year in France. In 1903 the brothers had flown and by 1906 the sale of the airplane had begun. What the book well draws is the excitement and incredulity of man being able to fly, and it looks at how these two brothers did this. The two brothers are, in my view exceptional people, not really for what they achieved but for their steadfastness, their determination and hard work. Both had only a high school education and they financed their work on the sales from their bicycle company! They were not backed by big money! Others were, and they failed. For me the book imparted a clear picture of the personality of the two brothers, their father and their younger sister Katherine. She too was part of their team. I appreciated that McCullough took the time to elucidate her role. I very much enjoyed the quotes from the brothers\u2019 letters and speeches. I loved Wilbur\u2019s heartfelt response to his reception in France. I loved the small details describing people; sometimes it is the unbuttoned button of a jacket or a shamrock in a buttonhole. McCullough\u2019s works are not just well researched but that which is put there in the book is interesting. He doesn\u2019t throw too much at you; he sifts through what is important, relevant and amusing, so you see the people and the times. BUT\u2026..I close the book with some questions. I want to know more about Wilbur's, Orville's and Katherine's childhood years, and more about their older siblings. I want to know more about the split between Orville and Katherine after her marriage in 1926 with Henry Joseph Haskell. I want to know how it came to be that the children were not religious; their father, Milton, was a Bishop of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. What the book gave me was very good, but I would have been pleased with more, more biographical details. I wonder if some of the less complimentary personal characteristics are not here?!The emphasis is on their flying achievement. I do though have a mania for biographical details. You might be satisfied with a little bit less rather than more!The author narrates his own book. I liked the narration, because it is very slow. That may not please others. Sometimes he mumbles a bit, but heck I understood. I could feel when he wanted to emphasize the importance of an event. You could almost hear the thought, \"Hey, pay attention!\" I felt he wanted to give me time to absorb all the details and the importance of what was being said. So, I personally liked the narration very much."}, {"userName": "Jill Hutchinson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson", "userReview": "I hate to admit it but I never knew much about the Wright brothers beyond the basic story of their invention of the \"flying machine\". Now that I have finished this well done biography by one of my favorite historians, it appears that there wasn't much to know about them in the first place. Their whole lives were dedicated to the premise that man could fly and that they were going to find the secret. They had very few friends, no lady friends, no hobbies, were secretive, shy, and as close as identical twins. Their great talent was mechanical and they started with bicycles. Once they built the best bicycles on the road, they turned their eyes to the idea of flight. And history began.Man had flown in hot air balloons but this was not what Orville and Wilbur were trying to achieve.....they wanted a machine driven by an engine that could be controlled by the operator and could perform turns, dips, fly at different altitudes and speeds and land safely. They looked for the perfect place to work in isolation and that had the geographic features necessary for their project. They decided on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, in those days a practically deserted area of the United States, and built their workshop. Their work ethic was almost supernatural and errors and accidents were quickly overcome as their determination grew. And on December, 17, 1903, Orville Wright and his Flyer 1 took to the air. He only flew 120 feet in 12 seconds but it was a turning point in history.The book follows the perfecting of the flying machine, the world-wide acclaim of the Wright brothers and their invention, and the aviation work of others such as Glenn Curtiss and Louis Bl\u00e9roit (which often resulted in legal suits over patents). This is a short book, especially for one written by McCullough, but it covers in detail the work and dedication of the Wright brothers which changed the world. But you will not find out much about the brothers themselves since there isn't much to know....their lives were aviation and all else was just incidental.

David McCullough is a great admirer of the Wright Brothers. He mentions, over and over again, how passionate and single-minded they were. They focused on their purpose; to develop the science of aeronautics to the point where flight would become possible. They worked very very hard, all day long, under less-than-optimal conditions. I did not realize that for a few years they flew only gliders at Kitty Hawk, before attempting to use an engine for powered flight.Both of the Wright Brothers were detail-oriented. They had to be, because the alternative would have been failure or worse; fatal. When they gave demonstrations of their inventions, they did not give any thought about the celebrities or leaders in the spectator stands; if conditions were unfavorable, they would just pack the airplane back into the hangar, and wait for more favorable winds.Wilbur was a true Renaissance genius. He had a broad range of knowledge about virtually every subject. And Orville was mechanically brilliant. Over the course of several years, the two of them developed the science and their inventions; living for months at a time under primitive conditions at Kitty Hawk, their activities and materials cost them a total of about one thousand dollars. They did not really care about fame or fortune. They did, however, care that they receive proper credit as the inventors of the airplane, and protected their interests through patent lawsuits. The book also discusses their sister Katherine, who was indispensable to their journey.Their flights were risky; any number of components could malfunction, leading to a crash. They were reluctant to take passengers who were national leaders. In fact, they were reluctant to fly together, lest a crash would kill them both without someone to carry on their work.After reading this book, it is hard not to be extremely respectful of the amazing dedication of the Wright Brothers. David McCullough has done an excellent job of helping us understand the brothers and their family. I listened to this book as an audiobook; the author is the narrator, which is a bit unfortunate.

David McCullough, a favorite for many of us, weaves another powerful tale. I\u2019ll confess in my looking forward to his next book that I was disappointed when I saw the press clippings for it some months ago. I wanted another John Adams or 1776. I don\u2019t feel that way after actually reading the book. In the hands of this master writer, we learn both how important and interesting were Wilbur and Orville and how revolutionary flying was when they brought it about. I don\u2019t believe anything in my lifetime has equaled taking to the skies in the early 1900s.Wilbur and Orville were unique. Never showing any interest in getting married, never afraid to go their own way no matter what anyone else thought, and never deviating from the raising of their preacher father, they do not fit the common mold. Dismiss out of hand any comments that the characterizations here are one-dimensional. The Wright brothers simply do not fit the modern mold especially. Mr. McCullough obviously felt no need to manufacture some speculations that tantalize our generation. He just gave us the Wright brothers as they were. I enjoyed getting to know them and have nothing but respect for them. The saw the prize out ahead of them and never rested till they had it.The setbacks, the hardships (Kitty Hawk was not pleasant then), the secrecy when fame was dangling in front of them, the danger, the crashes, the occasional family drama but unwavering devotion\u2013the story never sags. The competition with others trying to get the title of first to truly fly was always part or the story. The initial reluctance of the U.S. to show interest while France was ready to embrace them is interestingly portrayed. You admired the brilliance of these amateur mechanics as you read and are amazed at the mathematical and scientific ground they covered in their relentless research.This volume can proudly take its place on the hollowed bookshelf of Mr. McCullough\u2019s writings.

In his look at the Wright Brothers, the author basically focuses on the 15 years between 1895 and 1910. These are the years of the brothers developed an interest in flight, proved their concepts, and then concluded a very successful tour of Europe, demonstrating their mastery of the air.In telling their story, Mr. McCullough also looks at their close family ties, especially with their sister Katherine. As lifelong bachelors, she basically ran their home life and lived with them until her marriage quite late in life. After the marriage Orville refused to have anything more to do with her and even refused to attend the ceremony. Their relationship with their father is also explored, although not to the same extent as with their sister. However personal stories are a very minor portion of the book.The main focus is their invention of powered flight and its aftermath in their lives. In fact the story of the first heavier than air powered flight actually comes quite early in the narrative, about 1/3rd mark. Their selection of Kitty Hawk for their experiments is explained and the fact that at the time of the first flight was the brothers 4th annual trip to the site. Each year they brought an improved glider to test the control system among other things. I found the story of Wilber\u2019s first trip interesting. It was a 2 day trip by a broken down sailing ship and he was seasick most of the way. Another example of their resourcefulness is the story of the development of the engine for their first airplane. The put out a Request for Proposal for an engine and didn\u2019t get any satisfactory responses. So with the help of one of their employees at their bicycle factory, they designed and built their own.In telling the story of the invention of powered flight, Mr. McCullough illustrates the methodical way the Wrights worked. While both were high school drop outs, they were mechanically gifted and have a good grasp of mechanical principles. Their study of birds and how they controlled their flight led to their development if wing warping. He also mentions their development of a homemade wind tunnel to test the wing designs.In additions to the Wrights, the author also looks at who was doing what in the race for powered flight. He does a pretty good job of telling Samuel Langley\u2019s story. According to the author he was the Wrights main completion for the title of the first man to make a powered flight.The reaction to the news of the first flight was enlightening \u2013 almost none. When they wrote to the US Gov\u2019t, the reaction seemed to be, \u201cThat\u2019s nice. Prove it.\u201d It seems it took a few months and some demonstration flights in Dayton for the news to sink in.The last portion of the book covers the Brother\u2019s trips to Europe in 1908, 1910 on what were basically business trips. They were trying to interest European Gov\u2019ts and esp their militaries in their invention. The author does a good job of telling the enthusiastic reception they received, both in England and in France.While they were relatively successful, they didn\u2019t become wealthy. Mr. McCullough states that when he died in 1912 Wilbur left an estate of appox $120,000 and when Orville died in 1948 his estate was valued at just over $1 million. As Mr. McCullough says, they were well-to-do, but not really wealthy.All in all a very solid read, but not extensive.

He credits those whose work inspired them and details how the brothers studied those materials, the flight of birds, and ended up inventing the wind tunnel to get accurate data. He explains the reluctance of the press and governments around the world to believe that manned flight had been achieved by these men.

This book brings the Wright family dynamics and personalities to life. The brothers really did work hard on their project. One of the things they learned after finding that their glider's flight was unstable is that all existing literature of the time about wing design was little more than guess work. The Wright brother designed their own wind tunnel and tried out numerous configurations before they came up with a wing design for stable flight.The comparison of the Wright brothers' work with the efforts of Samuel P. Langley of the Smithsonian is a classic David versus Goliath tale. Langley with government funding managed to spend $70,000 on flights that did little more than flop into the Potomac. The Wright brothers using inexpensive materials and technology learned from building bicycles to accomplish powered flight for a total cost of about $1,000. One of the biggest differences between the two endeavors is that the Wright brothers had a machinist friend who in retrospect was a genius craftsman. He was able manufacture a light gas powered internal combustion engine to use on the flying machine in about six weeks. Langley's engineers in contrast took years to do the equivalent. This book goes into more detail about their time spent in Europe than any other source I've read. The European governments were more interested in (and willing to pay for) flying machines than the Americans. In retrospect they were visiting Europe during the prosperous climax of the Edwardian age a couple years prior to World War I.The brothers spent much of their time in later years defending their patents. I guess we shouldn't be too critical of this because tech companies today probably spend as much money on patent defense as on technical research. The Wright brothers won all their contested patent suits.Wilber Wright died at the relatively young age of 47 (of typhoid). With him gone and the death of their father soon after, Orville Wright and his sister Kathryn were left at their home in Dayton, Ohio. When Kathryn decided to marry an acquaintance from her College days Orville refused to attend the wedding or visit her afterward. Orville's behavior is regrettable, and I can't help but think that if Wilber had been living his presence would have ameliorated the family relationships.The following book review is from the PageADay Book Lover's Calendar for March 27, 2018:Wibur and Orville Wright were bicycle mechanics from Dayton, Ohio. Neither of them had a college education or much money, but they had a lot of ingenuity. Together they risked their lives in the first attempts at human flight\u2014and their success paved the way for the future of airplanes. David McCullough brings empathy and a sense of wonder to the Wright legend, and also reveals the crucial role that their overlooked sister, Katherine, played in their story.

This is my second and I loved it.The story of the Wright Brothers is as fascinating as it is incredible. From this book I learned that they were hard working men and SO determined. Never did they give up-despite the failure of numerous tests. Neither did they ever become anyone's pawn-they refused many offers of financial backing. Even though there were times when I'm sure they could have used it, they preferred to remain independent. They may have been disturbed at times by newspapers and various magazines that described them as crazy and wasting their time, but they paid no heed. They camped out, in tents and outbuildings when performing their aerial testing-often coming close to running out of food. They were attacked by mosquitoes-once so severely they almost gave up and went home.I think the trait that stuck with me the most was their humility. In much the same way that they ignored the doubters and naysayers, they also ignored those who wanted to put them on pedestals. They always kept their heads down and their eyes on the ball. From their interesting family life, to their bicycle shop and all of their various ups and downs, I found the Wright Brothers to be interesting and amazing examples of American entrepreneurship. I find myself inspired by their story and proud to be from a country that could inspire men to such greatness. I recommend this book to anyone even slightly interested in learning more about the Wright Brothers. I checked out the audio book from the library since I loved McCullough's John Adams so much, and I am so pleased that I did.

At times the author presents some fairly technical details but he does so in a manner that can be appreciated by all.The focus of McCullough\u2019s book is the development of the airplane between the years 1900 and 1909 by the Wright brothers. Year after year, the brothers returned to Kitty Hawk to perfect the wings by gliding. In a stiff wind, the brothers would fly the plane like a kite. In their time off they would lean against a fence and observe how birds fly so that they could apply these concepts to their plane. After perfecting the wings and fuselage, the brothers had a trusted bicycle shop employee by the name of Charlie Taylor, build an aluminum 4-cylinder engine. Meanwhile, the brothers designed and built propellers. Amazingly, the brothers were self-funded by their bicycle shop. They would sell bicycles to fund their development activities and annual trips to Kitty Hawk. Meanwhile, there were other well-funded consortiums trying to develop an airplane. The Smithsonian was funding Langley\u2019s aerodrome. The Langley aerodrome currently hangs from the ceiling of the Air and Space museum. It is a good thing it hangs there because that is the only way that thing would get off the ground. Wilbur went to France to demonstrate the capabilities of the new Wright Brother\u2019s airplane. The French were also trying to develop a plane but their efforts could barely get off the ground while the Wright Brothers were flying figure-eight patterns and staying airborne for 30 minutes at a time. The French loved Wilbur Wright and the brothers became heroes there. The feeling was mutual and there were no accounts of rude Frenchmen. Many so-called experts of the day wrote technical articles indicating that it was impossible to fly. This was at the same time the brothers were developing their plane. This reminds me of the 4-minute mile. That was another milestone that the experts said was impossible to surpass. This book stands as an example of what humanity is capable of when they can conceive and believe it. Look how far we have come!During the wars that followed, Orville was asked about their invention being used as an instrument of death. He compared the invention of the airplane to man's discovery of fire.

While McCullough has stretched the traditional definition of biography with some of his past work, another unique approach is used in creating a single narrative for both brothers. As the reader will see, McCullough is not off base in doing things from this perspective, as Wilbur and Orville Wright were alike in many ways. These similarities extend to the three themes the author presents throughout the book, depicting the brothers as Dayton inventors, Ohio innovators, and American dreamers. These distinctions, while interconnected, arise independently throughout the narrative and offers the reader a better roadmap (or should I say flight plan?) when absorbing McCullough's work. A great piece to interest any reader curious about the dawn of flight.Wilbur and Orville Wright could easily be called the great Dayton inventors. They came from modest means and had a mid-sized family in Dayton, Ohio. Their sister, Katharine, was always close at hand and supported them through their exploratory phase, where the Wrights sought to better understand the world around them. Wilbur and Orville both had a penchant for inventing things, having left small projects scattered around the house from a young age. Although four years separated them, the brothers were inseparable and soon became partners in their printing business and opened and bicycle shop together, when that mode of transportation was all the rage. While raised in a religious household, Wilbur and Orville saw something else when they turned to the skies, the possibility of flight. They constructed numerous contraptions, formulating wings akin to those of birds and not flat bands of cloth over wood or metal skeletons. As McCullough argues, while European gliders were already taking to the skies, the Wrights wanted sustained flight, not entirely tied to wind velocity and clement weather. With no formal engineering education (nothing post-secondary at all), they worked on ideas to invent something that would allow them to soar in the air, at least for a time. The issue of flight did not originate with them, for as far back as da Vinci, scientists speculated about flight in a concrete manner. McCullough shows throughout the text that neither brother would accept the common argument that man was not meant to conquer the air, choosing instead to find a way, through their inventive minds, to bridge the gap.Once they'd developed a prototype idea, the Wrights set their sights to become Ohio innovators, honing their craft outside Dayton. With the supplies needed and the intuition on how to turn an idea into reality, Orville and Wilbur devised a flying machine. After an exhaustive search they spent a few summers in the hamlet of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina fine tuning the machine and its core components. McCullough discusses how early prototypes sought to secure the wings in one spot, but the brothers soon learned that movement of the wings, outside of a sedentary position, was key to aeronautical success. By December 17, 1903, they took to the air and opened a new and exciting chapter in their lives. These innovations were not without stumbling blocks. Not only were the Wrights forced to wage war against the weather and physics, but a severe outbreak of mosquitos. Acting as their own personal Waterloo, these winged fiends drove Wilbur and Orville to shorten their experimental periods during at least one summer and proved an essential hurdle in the larger battle to see the inventive spirit blossom into innovative output that would change the world forever. The Wright Brothers took their invention and chose to become American dreamers, as they marketed the ideas for the world to see. While Wilbur headed over to France to firm up financial backing for the machines, Orville remained in America to show off the new machine. Both used this time to demonstrate the lengths to which their machines could function, performing death-defying feats of bravery, figure-8 loops, and sustained aeronautical abilities. Both caught the attention of the general public and royalty alike, offering primitive air shows and answers questions to the best of their abilities. McCullough posits that this was how Wilbur and Orville lived the American Dream on opposite sides of the ocean, both seeking a life of adventure while demonstration the lengths to which the machines could travel. They continued working on their flying machines, but had passed on the knowledge and tutored various military officers from a handful of countries about the art of flying. Making an indelible mark on history, Wilbur and Orville will forever be remembered for taking flight from a scientific question to a concrete reality, and all by chasing a dream.McCullough uses the brief space he has to tell a wonderful story and keep the reader highly interested. As I have read a number of his past pieces, I was certain this tome would prove just as intriguing. Flight in general is too large a topic to handle in a biography, though the Wright Brothers as individuals is also too difficult, mainly because they were so interconnected. As McCullough discusses in the early chapters, they sounded alike, wrote alike, and even thought alike on occasion. Differentiating these men proves highly daunting, though their accomplishments can be equally attributed and therefore fits nicely in this joint piece. McCullough opens the door for the reader to learn more, should that be their desire. As with all McCullough pieces, the reader can pick or choose how much they want to take away, with so much from which to choose. Kudos, Mr. McCullough for your wonderful insight into early 20th century innovation. You have touched the historical and biographical world with so much of interest and yet you never cease to amaze me.Like/hate the review?

Contemporary yet conservative. Frugal but not selfish. A supporter of science in conjunction with religion, an avid reader, active promoter of women's rights and human rights.

The last sentence of the book read \"On July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong, another American born and raised in southwestern Ohio, stepped on the moon, he carried with him, in tribute to the Wright brothers, a small swatch of the muslin from a wing of their 1903 Flyer.\""}, {"userName": "Praxedes", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4413597-praxedes", "userReview": "Once again McCullough regales the reader with his skillful portrayal of prominent figures (as he did with Truman, John Adams, etc.). His writing is crisp as always and his talent in mixing primary sources seamlessly into the story line never ceases to amaze.He spent quite a deal on the Wright's visits to Europe, of which I knew little, and would have enjoyed more technical specs on their flying invention. But it's still a fun and didactic read."}], "description": "The #1 New York Times bestseller from David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize\u2014the dramatic story-behind-the-story about the courageous brothers who taught the world how to fly\u2014Wilbur and Orville Wright.On a winter day in 1903, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, two brothers\u2014bicycle mechanics from Dayton, Ohio\u2014changed history. But it would take the world some time to believe that the age of flight had begun, with the first powered machine carrying a pilot.Orville and Wilbur Wright were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity. When they worked together, no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education and little money never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off, they risked being killed.In this \u201cenjoyable, fast-paced tale\u201d (The Economist), master historian David McCullough \u201cshows as never before how two Ohio boys from a remarkable family taught the world to fly\u201d (The Washington Post) and \u201ccaptures the marvel of what the Wrights accomplished\u201d (The Wall Street Journal). He draws on the extensive Wright family papers to profile not only the brothers but their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them. Essential reading, this is \u201ca story of timeless importance, told with uncommon empathy and fluency\u2026about what might be the most astonishing feat mankind has ever accomplished\u2026The Wright Brothers soars\u201d (The New York Times Book Review).", "title": "The Wright Brothers", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453537-the-wright-brothers", "average": 4.14, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437504162l/24453537.jpg", "reviews": 4928, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6281688.David_McCullough", "name": "David McCullough"}], "type": ["History", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "North American Hi..."], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453537-the-wright-brothers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609391-the-wright-brothers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22669004-the-wright-brothers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203.John_Adams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1067.1776", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2279.Truman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2368.Mornings_on_Horseback", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10131648-the-greater-journey"]}
