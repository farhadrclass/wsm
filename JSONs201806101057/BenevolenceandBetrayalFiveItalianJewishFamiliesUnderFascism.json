It\u2019s structured in exactly the way I complained The Last Jews in Berlin wasn\u2019t \u2013 that is, an unbroken account of each set of characters so that you\u2019re able to fully immerse yourself in each narrative. The characters are almost all fascinating. There\u2019s the fervent Jewish Fascist who had the offices of a Jewish newspaper in Florence burnt to the ground because he thought they were too critical of Mussolini\u2019s government; there\u2019s a notorious Jewish novelist who works as a spy for the fascist secret police; there\u2019s a playboy aviator who ends up saving hundreds of Jews from the Nazis and one night even sleeps at the German Embassy so brazen is he; there\u2019s the plight of the poor families of the Roman ghetto and in particular one woman who never stops shouting at Nazis and miraculously survives Auschwitz where she takes lice from her body and plants them in the trousers of SS officers (it\u2019s her job to sow buttons on SS uniforms). It\u2019s heartening to learn how much help the Catholic Church provided and in particular a few very courageous individuals. Also to learn that Schindler wasn\u2019t alone; a few very powerful Italian businessmen provided funds for DELASEM, the organisation that helped the Jews. One Jewish Italian though remained bitter about Italy\u2019s role, pointing out they stamped all Jewish identity papers with a tell-tale mark, making it impossible for them to hide and handed over lists of addresses to the Gestapo. And as a mark of how petty people are there\u2019s the story of how the Jewish community in Rome demonised two Jewish sisters who survived Auschwitz because they assumed the girls had offered sexual favours to survive. Extraordinary how after what happened during the war such blinkered prejudice could still find a voice. I whole heartedly recommend this for anyone interested in the subject matter."}, {"userName": "Violet wells", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells", "userReview": "A brilliantly and thoroughly researched account of the plights of five different Italian Jewish families during WW2. Alexander Stille, the author, has interviewed surviving members of each of the families and presents a narrative history pulsing with riveting and profoundly moving anecdotes. The families live in different cities \u2013 Turin, Ferrara, Rome and Genoa. There are several truly memorable characters. There\u2019s Ettore Ovazzi who is a militant fascist and remains so even after the anti-Semitic racial laws are introduced. He runs a newspaper which condemns unpatriotic Jews. There\u2019s the writer Pittigrilli who works for OVRA, the Italian secret police and informs on the activities of all his Jewish friends, including the writer Carlo Levi. There\u2019s Franco Schonheit from Ferrara who together with his father survives Buchenwald and Franco\u2019s mother Gina who often stands up to the SS and miraculously survives Ravensbruck. There are the men and women of the Di Veroli family in the Jewish ghetto in Rome who are the poorest of Italian Jews and their narrative includes the moving story of how many Catholics donated gold and money when the Jewish leadership was ordered to supply a ransom of fifty kilos of gold. And there\u2019s Massimo Teglio, an aviator, who comes across as a Schindler character, instrumental in saving many lives and greatly helped by the bravery of members of the Catholic clergy. It really is a tale of benevolence and betrayal and highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject matter."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "Different cities and districts in Italy during the 1930's and 1940's all seem to have had greatly varying numbers of Jewish populations. Multiplied by so many various class and/or work occupation status. And the reactions and complicated levels of anti-fascism as varied, as well. So this is researched history with literally hundreds of documented characters within 5 family groups and their lives and outcomes during these years. It is a difficult read, it does not read as a novel. Turin so different from Rome, and smaller town groups different again. And the Jewish families themselves of completely varied political, religious attachments, and class level degrees. Like nearly everything in Italy, even today, who you know or what town job you have inherited and/or other factors of association to power or bribing influences never far out of the picture either. The photographs were interesting and the after war outcomes told in an epilogue, excellent too. For me the back story of Carlo Levi (attached to the Fao group) was known but not entirely understood. Now I comprehend one of my favorite books \"Christ Stopped at Eboli\" much better."}, {"userName": "Marian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5969278-marian", "userReview": "Walking around Rome you occasionally notice small brass squares embedded in the sidewalk, each one engraved with the name of an Italian Jew who was sent to Auschwitz. In some cases entire families including babies were deported and killed. This story is horrifying but fairly well-known. Benevolence and Betrayal goes beyond the familiar horror into the more complex nature of the experience of Italian Jews, who were (and are) deeply assimilated into Italian society, and reluctant to believe that they were in danger. Many were fervent fascists, army officers, government officials, and respected members of society, where their religion seemed irrelevant. Some were poor, entrenched in former ghettos, oblivious to the ominous changes about to occur. Some were resistance fighters. Some bravely stood their ground in an attempt to strengthen and hold their community together. There had been persecution, but no threat to their lives. After the Nazi invasion in 1943, this changed. Italians met the change in extremely different ways. Non-Jewish Italians sometimes betrayed their Jewish neighbors; but many others hid them, forged new identities,took them to safety, paid enormous sums to meet Nazi ransom demands, and saved their lives. This may explain why, unlike most European Jews, after the war the majority of Italian Jews returned to live again in Italy.Stille's report on this time features vivid characterization and suspense enough to drive the best thriller. I thought it was important and engrossing, and would especially recommend it to anyone interested in Italy, World War II, or the European holocaust."}, {"userName": "Robyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1779701-robyn", "userReview": "This book provides fantastic insight into the plight of Italian Jews during the Holocaust. I found it especially poignant to read while living in Italy, so close to many of the events. The fate of Jews during this period was not cut and dry and neither was the response on the part of the Italian government. I was most impressed to learn the pivotal role played by the Catholic leadership in Genoa (where we currently reside), who worked alongside the Jewish underground to rescue thousands of Jews. Although it's a harrowing subject, the book is a breezy read (lest for some overlap/repetition that should have been edited away). Highly recommended to anyone interested in Italian and/or Jewish history."}, {"userName": "Joan Brown", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732856-joan-brown", "userReview": "Fascinating book. At first I felt a bit like I was reading a textbook, but, especially with the later families and with the updates on these families at the end, I feel that I know the people, though as always I stand in awe of their bravery. I can't imagine risks like this - the hiding and running from, or risking the dangers of providing sanctuary for...The wealth of primary source research made this come alive. The letters and diaries and reported conversations are those of real people, not just historical figures. It makes me wish that I'd spoken more intimately to my grandparents, and that my parents, especially my dad would speak more openly about his early life and the war etc. with my kids.This is a book that I'll continue to think about."}, {"userName": "Cynthia Alice", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29767997-cynthia-alice", "userReview": "Enjoyed it so much more than I initially expected to! The author has such a strong love for the Italian people generally, such an understanding of the history, uniqueness, and diversity within both the fascist and antifascist movements.  This one book taught me more about Italy, Italian fascism and resistance to it, than I've learned in a lifetime!"}, {"userName": "Lorri", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3879812-lorri", "userReview": "Benevolence and Betrayal: Five Italian Jewish Families Under Fascism by Alexander Stille is intense, compelling and extraordinary in its details and depths.The stories within this compelling book revolve around five Italian Jewish families preceding and during World War II, and their plight, idealism, their commonalities and their differences. Put together the stories read like an intriguing and profound historical novel, rather than five separate accountings of Italian Jewish families whose lives are affected in different, yet similar, ways.Benevolence and Betrayal (the title of the book), stems from the fact that the Italian Jews and fascism seemingly coexisted for almost two decades before the Anti-Semetic roots dug deep into the skin and earth of the Italians, gripping like a vine, and causing some to betray Jews, and others to rush to help them.Although the families come from different backgrounds, social classes, occupations and geographical areas of Italy, their stories are strong and vivid, and each one represents a part of the whole, in the Italian-Jewish structure.From the accounts of the lives of a Jewish facist family and an antifacist Jewish family, a Jewish family living in the ghettos of Rome and a family in Genoa, and finally to a family whose members were deported to Germany, the book is a revalation on the actual issues and almost unknown situations that happened to occur in Italy during World War II.Stille\u2019s book is more than compelling, it is a profound and historical accounting of events in Italy leading up to, and including, World War II, and it is eye-opening, heart-wrenching, mesmerizing and absorbing read. I was astounded by what I read, and realize how ignorant I had been about the Italian Jewish factor during World War II. I read the book straight through in one day."}, {"userName": "Kelly Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/299102-kelly-hicks", "userReview": "First Stille book I read, and I was totally hooked. Such a compelling history of these families. I had no idea of the details of Italian Jewish families under fascism, usually because Hitler and Nazism takes center stage.
