James Patterson, in my eyes, has sold out to commercialism as of late. He seems all about publishing as many books as possible to collect royalties. I read two of his series, Michael Bennett and The Private franchises. I do enjoy his book shots, as the short length seems to fit the Storylines better. He doesn't have to combine stories to make it full length. His full length novels that I have read over the past couple of years have been subpar at best. I only continue because I have some strange sense that I must read all of a particular series. I was intrigued by this book because it was based in Chicago, but didn't give it much of second thought. Then I was browsing the new reads at my local library, and I saw it. I picked back up and the little blurb Patterson wrote on the back line caught my eye....\"Best book I have written in a while.\" I decided to give it a shot, and boy am I glad I did. The story is split between the past and the present. Billy Harvey is a Chicago cop who busts a high end prostitution ring with his partner. Shortly there after he is the only survivor in a shootout that claims this partner and assistant district attorney, both of whom he was sleeping with. One problem, he has lost his memory of the events leading up to the shootout. Patterson and his co-author, David Ellis, do a masterful weaving between past and present to tell the story. The storyline is solid, and full of interesting characters. I couldn't make up my mind who was behind it as there were so many options. In the end I was completely off the mark. The ending was excellent and the whole thing was a page turner. Overall an easy five star that any mystery reader will love. I highly recommend picking up this book."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/672625-susan", "userReview": "The Black BookJames PattersonOMG!! You have seen the TV commercial where James Patterson says THE BLACK BOOK is his best book in twenty years right? Well ladies and gentlemen, he isn't lying! Holy cow people!! THE BLACK BOOK blew my mind, totally screwed with my head, and then blew my mind once again! It was that good! All while I was reading, I totally had it figured out only to be wrong over and over again! I love when an author keeps me guessing. THE BLACK BOOK goes back and forth between the past and the present. It's the story of Billy Harvey who is a detective in Chicago. His twin sister, Patti, is also a detective and his dad is the chief of detectives. Billy is a good detective, just as his sister and Dad are but Billy's world is about to change in ways he never imagined. It all happens the night he busts the mayor and a half a dozen other big names in a prostitution sting in a brothel downtown. The woman who runs the brothel, kept a black book with all the details in it. THE BLACK BOOK is now missingNot long after this all goes down, his long time partner Kate, his new girlfriend Amy, and Billy himself are all found shot in a bloody condo that is Amy's. Kate and Amy are dead and soon everyone thinks Billy did it. He got shot in the head and has no memory of what happened. He truly believes someone is setting him up but he isn't sure. He can't remember and he isn't sure of who he can trust. Does a story get any better than this?The twists and turns in the BLACK BOOK are going to keep you up late into the night trying to figure it out. One minute you believe Billy killed his partner and girlfriend and the next you are sitting there shaking your head, wondering what the heck just happened. I had my suspicions, I had it all figured out, or so I thought, and BAM.......wrong again! Once you start reading, trust me, you aren't going to be able to stop! When the black book finally shows up, I was shocked at who had it!"}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "Billy Harney, his twin sister Patty and their father were all cops.

Who could Billy trust as he gradually, painfully tried to find the truth?The Black Book by James Patterson is a fast-paced thriller which I thoroughly enjoyed. Set in The Past and The Present \u2013 prior to the shooting and after the shooting \u2013 the gradual release of the lead up to the dramatic events which changed Billy\u2019s life were extremely well done, with a brilliant twist to conclude!

A complete page turner from start to finish. The back and forth from past to present is expertly done to tell an entertaining, gripping, and thrilling story. I agree with James Patterson that this is his best work to date so far. I will continue to support one of my favorite authors and read all his novels (my favorite being the Alex Cross series)."}, {"userName": "Monnie", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie", "userReview": "Call me flamboozled. Call me chastised for all the potshots I've taken at Patterson's works of late (on second thought, check that - I meant what I said). Above all, call me happy that I ignored my previous rants and read this book.The title, as one might expect, refers to a missing \"little black book\" that didn't turn up after a raid and thorough search at a house of ill repute at which some of Chicago's finest are customers. Needless to say, the house madam ain't talking - and without it, finding even more high-level patrons (including cops on the take) and others who weren't present during the raid, may never be found.At the epicenter is police detective Billy Harney and his partner, detective Kate Fenton. Billy's sister Patti is a cop as well, their dad, Daniel, was chief of detectives, and dad's friend (and Billy's beloved mentor) heads up Internal Affairs, so clearly copness is a family affair. As the raid is analyzed, Billy insists he had every right to initiate it; but Amy Lentini, the beautiful assistant state's attorney, seems out to prove that it wasn't justifiable (and therefore was illegal), thus putting the kabosh on potential prosecution of everyone captured.In reality, that event took place in Billy's fairly recent past; his present has taken a very different turn that has left him unable and/or unwilling to remember details (including, perhaps, the whereabouts of that little black book). Chapters shift back and forth, with \"past\" chapters peeling away more clues to what really happened. Usually, I'm not fond of this technique - nor did I love it here. But it's actually done very well and helped keep me on the edge of my seat even though I guessed pretty much from the start who was behind everything. In fact, besides an intriguing, fast-moving story, my desire to find out if my guess was right (it was) and learn the how and why was a big part of what kept me going.All in all, it's a totally engrossing book. The Patterson-Ellis collaboration hasn't always produced such stellar efforts - I'm referring specifically to The Murder House and Mistress, to which I gave 4 and 3 stars, respectively - but this one hit the mark. More, please!"}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4852457-suzanne", "userReview": "The Black Book is by far is my favorite James Patterson book I have read recently!

I believe this book \u2013 The Black Book \u2013 is the best work I\u2019ve done in twenty years. Hope you enjoy it\u201d \u2013 James Patterson. I must say that I read a lot of Patterson\u2019s books and I found this self-promoting promise a bit annoying. For over the past ten years, he\u2019s published a book every other month in one of his several continuing bestselling detective series or stand-alone mysteries. That\u2019s a lot of books! And he\u2019s now saying this new book is one the best he\u2019s ever written. That almost borders on arrogance. Should we just ignore everything else he\u2019s published as unworthy of reading? It seems a bit insulting to the readers\u2026I\u2019ve generally enjoyed reading Patterson\u2019s books, which I get from the library because I don\u2019t find him good enough to buy and keep in my library. He\u2019s mind candy \u2013 simple, fast-paced, detective and mystery oriented adventures that can be read in about two to three days and easily left behind. Nice escapism, but nothing super memorable.Anyway, I put the self-promotional blurb to the test as I read the book. I really hate to say this, but guess what? He\u2019s right. This was one of the best books of his (and his list of many co-authors) that I have read in a long time. I enjoyed Cross Justice a lot two years ago, the first Private novel a lot, but this one brought me back to the intense moments of Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls. It is a detective story of Billy Harney, who survives a shooting with his girlfriend and partner while investigating corrupt government officials and police officers in Chicago. As expected in a Patterson story, the plot unfolds at a frenetic pace, being told in both current and flashback stages. I must say the characters were interesting and had more depth and personality than usual. The big kicker is that the mystery is well thought out, has multiple layers, and even more important (for those of us who confidently feel that we can figure out the guilty party before he/she is revealed), the outcome is surprising and extremely well-delivered! What a payoff ending!Overall, this book was an absolute joy to read. Patterson is right \u2013 it is one of his best books. I just hope that I don\u2019t have to wait another ten years (and twenty books) for him to deliver on his promise of quality again.

This is because while The Black Book delivered some positive elements I look for in a mystery/thriller, it fell far short in delivering several other key elements I require in a book I'd recommend to others.On the plus side, The Back Book is a very fast-paced, attention-holding, plot-driven thriller that has an above average amount of twists and turns. However, for me, these pluses were far outweighed by the following key negatives: ...Characters that were very so weakly developed that I could never get a good picture in my mind of what any of them physically looked like, nor could I get anything more than a tissue-paper thin understanding of their motivations for their actions. As such, I never came to care one way or the other about any of the characters....Dialog and prose that very often were clich\u00e9-ridden and didn't \"ring true.\"...Several of the plot twists and turns intended to provide reader suspense too often seemed contrived and strained credulity, and...Perhaps most disappointing to me is that I was able to figure out the so-called surprise ending of \"who really did it and why\" halfway through the book.Quite obviously, my opinion of The Black Book is much less favorable than the large majority of reader reviews and, thus, runs the risk of generating a lot of \"No/not helpful\" votes. Nonetheless, if my review provides some \"food for thought\" in helping decide if The Black Book is a book for you, I'll feel it's done its job.1 \u00bd stars rounded up to 2 stars."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17042835-tim", "userReview": "Finally, I give up trying to find a good story by the Patterson brand.

In a narrative set in the 'past', Billy Harney and Kate Fenton are hardworking members of Homicide in Chicago. While tailing a suspect, Harney makes the decision to raid a brownstone, which opens up a new and troublesome revelation; this is a brothel visited by the city's rich and powerful men. During the raid, a 'little black book' goes missing, with names that could bring even more of the rich and famous to their knees or serve as strong blackmail fodder. All eyes turn to Harney, who must try to clear his name, when it is presumed he pocketed it. As Fenton begins a power struggle with her partner, Harney must find out who is trying to frame him, adamant that he knows nothing of the book. With the case against the defendants caught in the raid fast approaching, Harney works with a hot-shot prosecutor, Amy Lentini, to ensure his testimony is flawless. Her icy exterior soon melts and she turns up the heat with Harney, which only clouds both their judgements. In a parallel narrative, set in the 'present', Harney is found naked, in bed with Lentini, while Detective Fenton lays on the floor. All three have been shot and the two women are dead, with Harney clinging to life and a bullet lodged in his skull. As the story continues, it appears Harney is being blamed for the murder, unable to remember anything from the past as it relates to the lead-up to the shooting or anything he may have learned about the black book. As the reader braces for an ever-evolving rollercoaster ride, the story takes twists and turns with everything centred around a list of names and the people will do anything to hold all the power. A powerful thriller that shows Patterson has the ability to rise to the occasion, with the right author at the helm. Highly recommended to any who enjoy losing themselves in quality writing.I have often said that James Patterson's writing has waned in the past few years, his lustre buried under many mediocre novels. However, when David Ellis comes to partner, their cooperation produces stellar writing and offers the reader a literary treat. While it may be a standalone, the novel offers an array of superior characters, wonderfully crafted to push the narrative forward without getting caught up in the minutiae. Working with the parallel narratives, Patterson and Ellis keep the reader guessing, while forcing a constant mental gear switch as the story develops, layering a revealed past with a present that is just as murky. If the reader can handle this mix, they are in for a punch to the gut during the numerous plot twists, which only adds the the overall flavour of the piece. Dark, but peppered with some dry humour to keep the reader smiling, Patterson and Ellis know the perfect recipe for a fast-paced thriller.Kudos, Messrs. Patterson and Ellis for joining forces again and showing that there is never an end to your abilities. I know I am in for a treat when your names grace the cover and hope to see more of your collaborative efforts soon.Like/hate the review?

I do not care for this book, and I do not think it is just because I dislike Chicago. At times, it seems as though the authors are just trying to play to male fantasies. This is not the first book in which Patterson does this, and it did not bother me as much as the book's absurdity.I write \"absurdity\" because there are several instances in which Patterson and Ellis are unsuccessful at getting me to suspend disbelief. Here are eight of them:1) If characters aligned with the brothel are trying to discredit the arresting officers, they could have used Billy and Kate's sexual relationship, which they were barely trying to hide even though they could have gotten in trouble for it. 2) The Quarterback of the Packers does not need to go to brothels. I have seen the women he dates.3) The Chicago Bears winning NFC? Maybe this book should be in the humor section. 4) Billy's miraculous recovery from being shot in the head is just ridiculous. 5) What is so comical about a camel coat? 6) The piece of evidence that becomes available at the end of the book does not make sense and is pretty much a reach. 7) and 8) The identity of one of the villains seems as though it is sort of just thrown in for shock value, and some of the reactions from some of the characters are also unbelievable.
