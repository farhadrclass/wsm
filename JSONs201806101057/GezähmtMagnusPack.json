If I could only use one word to describe this book it would be fun. This book was an absolute delight to read. Filled with witty banter, sarcastic undertones, an ill-tempered shape-shifter who is in over his head and a super bitchy heroine \u2013 what is not to love?????Sara Morrighan lost her mother as an infant and then at yet another young age her father was killed when they were attacked by mountain lions. Incidentally, this attack left Sara\u2019s face badly scarred as well as left her with a badly damaged leg. After the death of her father, Sara\u2019s psychotic and cantankerous grand-mother obtained custody of her moving her from California to a small town in Texas. Needless to say, Sara has not had the easiest of lives. When her crazy grand-mother finally passes away when Sara is twenty-eight years of age, Sara celebrates with the rest of the small town. Needless to say, there was no abundance of love for the irrational old coot. Six months have passed since her grandmother kicked the bucket and Sara is now dealing with indescribable and unbearable pain in her leg from her old injury and it seems to be getting worse. There can only be one explanation....she is definitely dying. Zach Sheridan has come to this small town in Texas with his pack to take Sara back to where she is originally from and to also let her in on the secret of her heritage. Sara\u2019s parent\u2019s belonged to Zach\u2019s pack prior to their deaths and they have waited long enough to explain to Sara that she is also a shape-shifting wolf. They tried to come for her immediately after the death of her father but her grandmother prevented them from taking her. Zach and his pack are also there to protect Sara from the Pride, a group of shape-shifting lions who are responsible for the death of her father. They are now after Sara seeing that her grandmother no longer poses a threat to them. When Zach finally meets Sara he is instantaneously attracted to her and this simply pisses him off. One, he is not one who wants to be bogged down with a mate when he is so close to becoming the pack Alpha. And two, the bitch is psychotic and he needs to stay the hell away. So why does he find her bitchy attitude and crazy demeanor such a turn on?Sara has no understanding as to why every time she gets near Zach her body lights up like the fourth of July. Zach's intensity and his animalistic growls leaves her all warm and fuzzy, not to mention turned on beyond belief with her special parts all tingly. Zach finds himself being unable to deny his connection with Sara. It is much more than a simple lustful attraction. She calls to his inner wolf and primal instincts and he is unable to decide whether he wants to mount her or slap her ass. When this aggressive, snarky and feisty heroine and the dominant alpha who is a jackass finally do get together the explosion is nuclear. It also leaves Zach knowing that he will never be able to walk away. She is his as much as he is hers. When danger comes to the forefront threatening Sara, Zach will stop at nothing to protect the woman who has claimed him in all her bitchy glory.All in all, Pack Challenge is a funny and sizzling hot paranormal read. This is my first Shelly Laurenston book and it certainly will not be my last. I love the mix of crazy humor and the supernatural world that this author has created. This book is not overly complicated as many paranormal reads tend to be. You get a pretty awesome hero and heroine and some hilarious secondary characters.

Of course a pack of werewolves who are a biker gang-slash-rave promoters are in town and they are there to protect her and help her become her wolfy self. We think. They are also putting on a huge rave in the woods.Living in Texas, and being around some of these small towns, I can say with authority that there is nothing redneck bikers like better than some pumping techno rave music with a European DJ. Let's get on our Harleys and roll, y'all!So, yeah. A little strange. But, I like strange sometimes, like in the latest books by this author with the crazy Nordic people. It's just that this book didn't have actual likable characters to pull this one off. Instead of funny and quirky, the main girl and her friends just came off as bitchy and immature. They were the kind of girls you avoided in high school because they thought it was funny to call each other sluts and to loudly talk about their sexual antics.Also, the sex was too much and too icky. It was like a gas station bathroom. Sure, the basic functionality is the same as a nice bathroom, but there is a definite feeling of squeamishness and the hope of getting through it as fast as you possibly can. The good thing about this book: it was short."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "[Fucking OUCH!

Even before you marked me, I belonged to you\u2026 as much as it annoys the shit out of me.\u201d\nOkay, I give in...I'm a sucker for a shifter story. I love the whole dynamic of the mate for life thing, there's almost always a great storyline, and most importantly they are always hotter than hell. That whole claiming thing...gets me every time. This story was no different.This story starts out with Sara, drunk in a bar, stirring up her normal amount of \"Drunk-Sara\" trouble. Little does she know she's playing a very dangerous game that night. If it wouldn't have been for her \"pretty boy\" rescuer and her crazy friends she could have been in a whole lot more trouble than making out in an alley with a stranger. \n\"You're to picky. Because I remember a few interested individuals that weren't too bad. Troy.\"\"Too strict.\"\"Fred\"\"Too Neat.\"\"Bobby Joe.\"\"Too Tall.\"\"Mike.\"\"Too short.\"\"Wait. There's still my personal favorite. Kenny Ray.\"\"Too Nice in bed.\"\"I bet Zach's not nice at all. In bed or out.\"\nZach has sworn no women will ever make him weak or hold him down. He has plans for his life and he's not about to let the love for a woman get in the way of them. But every since he was groped and kissed by the sassy little drunk girl at the bar he can't stop thinking about her. However, he has one mission, protect the girl, turn her and go on about his life. But something has changed and changes even more the night he watches her howling with the wolves on her front porch. After being invited to a party by the new bikers in town, Zach is apart of, Sara and her friends are a little hesitant to go but decide it's something they have to see. Once there, they end up having a really good time until Sara is talking with Zach and becomes in unbearable pain. He rushes her away and tries a little \"experiment\" on her to see if it will help her. What happens next is a surprise to everyone. Sara has no idea that she's a shifter and it's up to someone to tell her, however she ends up finding out without being told. I expected her to freak out a little more than she did, but she took the news quiet well. Of course, finding out she's a shifter is the least of Sara's problems at the moment. Turns out others are after as well and unlike Zach's Pack, the others want her dead. \n\"I've found that it's never the animals you have to worry about, Miki, It's the humans.\"\"I'll remember that when we find your torn, headless carcass.\"\nThis book was awesome! Yes, the first night I read it I passed out at 9%, but that is only because I was dosed up with Benadryl. Once I started today, I could not stop reading. The characters were amazing. OMG, Sara, Angelina and Miki said the funniest things to each other. I loved Sara's sassy attitude and how her girls knew one another and always had each others back and could second guess what they would do next. The chemistry between Zach and Sara was scorching hot. And that claiming scene,...wowza!! Did I mention I love when these shifters do their claiming, ahaha. If I was going to complain about anything, it would be that it was too short and left me wanting more in the end. Lucky for me, there are two more stories in the series so that should make me feel better, but they aren't about Sara and Zach and I felt like I barely got to know Sara and Zach and then the story was over. I still recommend, especially if you like shifters and paranormals. :)"}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2413680-audrey", "userReview": "This book wasn't bad, but it felt like a lot of the same thing - sex, sex, and more sex.Unlike the characters in this book, my world was not rocked by their constant world-rocking sex and physical attraction. The \"romance\" comprised mainly of the main characters' finding each other insanely hot and rip-your-clothes-off desirable. I just couldn't see what they saw in each other...other than their emphasis on the other person's being a \"hot piece of ass.\" Most of their scenes (once they got past the open distrust and wariness of the first 1/3 of the book - distrust laced with pent up lust, of course) end up with them naked and humping. After the fifth \"slipped his fingers in my pussy,\" my eyes began to glaze over in the sex scenes. Because the majority of the book is the sex scenes, that was a lot of eye-glazing, to be frank.I never thought I'd say it, but what it boils down to is this: less sexytimes, more storytimes, please.Oh yeah, and a group of female friends who can show their affection beyond just calling each other (and themselves) bitches, sluts, and whores would be a nice touch, too. I'm not opposed to the language; I was just bored by the repetitive nature of it. With not much else to show their relationship or affection, it was annoying and felt rather contrived."}, {"userName": "Ezinwanyi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4386752-ezinwanyi", "userReview": "The reader meets the very feisty Sara Morrighan with her girlfriends at a bar, where Zach Sheridan, Beta of the Magnus Pack, has ends up saving her from an attack. Sara has facial and physical scarring from an attack by a Pride that left her parents dead, so Sara has learned to make due with Mr. Right Now rather than hold out hope of some happily ever after.But there is an attraction between Zach and Sara, and when they become intimate, it begins to reveal things about Sara\u2019s true nature. The more time they spent together, the more Sara became stronger until those who meant her harm decide to finish what they started all those years ago.This audiobook was entertaining. It was fully of aggressive women and aggressive men (shifters). This story alternated POV between the hero Zach and the heroine Sara so it gave us just a little insight into both. Sara used her snarky mouth to hide her pain and vulnerability. After all her secret pain and the scars was something even her best friends could protect her from. It was in Sara\u2019s unity with Zach that allowed her maturation into who she was supposed to be. Since this story was short, there wasn\u2019t a lot of character development but there was a small introduction for the series to build upon.

She was all over the place but I settled for just not liking her. Zach didn't even seem to like her, and I had to agree with him but then he went and fell in love with her, so I was left by myself on the not-liking front.Lots of disrespectful chit-chat that is more annoying than it is cute. Lots of rough-ness, especially rough sex. It felt out of place and unnecessary. When I was reading this I was thinking that these people were acting like a bunch of 15/16 year olds would if they were openly looking to \"mate\" and had pack wars. They were too \"cool\" but really just seemed like jackasses.The first part of the book was slow. Lots of attitude while Zach watches over Sara and Sara becomes progressively more scared of her attraction to Zach and Zach keeps asking if she is coming to the 'party' (whoo).

There are reasons I'm not a huge PNR fan, and this book contains more than a couple of those reasons. Some PNR kicks it up a notch and actually gives us a bit of plot and character development along with the sexy times. And some doesn't. This book falls into the latter.I find it to be a major cop out when characters are so crazy sexually attracted to each other because of their shifter half, even thought they don't know each other and/or can't stand each other. So they don't know squat about the other person, and the little bit they do know they hate, but...Hey! I need to jump your bones! NOW! Because I am wolf! Hooooooooowl!So basically, the author doesn't have to try to create a believable relationship becauseHey! I am wolf! I must mount you!Ok, so we have these 2 characters who can't stand each other, but really want to rub on each other for no reason other than the wolf bit. So they finally succumb to their hormones, and have a wild night of crazy, rough, animal sex. Guess what? Now they love each other! How romantic is that? And when I say crazy, rough, animal sex, I'm being literal--there was no kindness, no tenderness, no gentleness. Not even a teensy bit. But did I mention that they're in wuv? Soooooo believable.And throw in the fact that the chick talks about her own sexual organs using the word \"pussy\" repeatedly. I guess I'm a prude, but it grossed my shit out. Honestly, male would walk into the room, and female would think to herself, \"Holy shit. My pussy is so wet.\" :vomit:And...male repeatedly called female wonderful terms of endearment like \"crazy bitch\", \"insane bitch\", \"psycho bitch\", etc. while he was screwing her. I think it was supposed to be funny, but I just thought it was stupid.Oh, and don't let me forget the chick's two best girlfriends. Holy shit--what a bunch of psychos. Was this supposed to be an example of healthy female relationships? Because all they did was fight and insult each other.

The night she stuck her tongue down the throat of her \u201cpretty man\u201d set everything in motion that would change her life forever. Zach show up on the back of his bike with the rest of his pack, and their friends see the sexual tension coming off the two. Her two crazy best friends have a difference in opinion, Angie will stop at nothing to get the two together while Miki will stop at nothing to convince Sara she can\u2019t trust the big handsome biker. \n\n\u201cDear God, woman. Are you talking about him fucking the aggression out of me?\u201d\n\nNow that the grandmother is out of the picture there are others who want to hurt her and Zach will do anything to protect the pack and that includes Sara even though she doesn\u2019t know it yet. Sara is floored with her reaction to Zach, every time he is near, her body takes over and she turns into some kind of \u201cwhore\u201d. The way he looks at her is so different, she not used to guys like him looking at her as if she was the hottest piece of ass in the room, rarely do guys look past the scar and the limp\n\n Oh, man\u2026 no one had ever kissed her like this. This man\u2019s tongue owned her. And he knew it, too.\n\nZach realizes there is something about Sara that calls on ever primal instinct he has buried deep, no matter how hard he fights his reaction, Sara is proving to be everything he wants but doesn't need in his life. Sara drives him up the freakin wall, you never knew what she was going to do or say, each day her body changes, she is stronger much more aggressive.

And that\u2019s when he decided\u2014 she was his.

They came to finish what they started \n\n\u201cMy first change? You mean I\u2019ve popped my change-cherry?\u201d\n\nReally good short yummy paranormal read, loved the fact that Sara was a little crazy and as alpha as Zach was, made for the perfect pair. There was a little bit more emphasis on their primal instincts that their human ones, it was very animalistic, which made it hot in its own unique way.

Cripes!The first book I read by Shelly Laurenston was Beast Behaving Badly. The heroine was one of the most irritating, hyper, unlikable characters I've ever seen in a romance novel. (For the record, I thought the hero-polar bear was adorable, thank God).But that was before I read Pack Challenge. In this book, the hero, the heroine, and all her side-kicks, are equally horrible. The hero Zach is horny and single-minded, and totally lacking in any leadership qualities as far as I could see. He is supposed to become the alpha male of the pack, but he spends the entire book worrying about getting it on with Sara, the heroine. Not such a hot leader. He borders on being disrespectful to her because of his extreme horniness, something I don't like in my heroes.Sara, the heroine, is a sarcastic, snarky bitch. She is emotionally stunted due to her upbringing by a vengeful and hateful grandmother. She is so immature (as are her best friends) I thought perhaps I was reading a YA book. Speaking of the word \"bitch\"-- Sara and her 2 side-kick girlfriends, Angelina and Miki, spend most of the book insulting each other, calling each other \"whore,\" \"bitch,\" and other terms of affection. Their maturity level appears to be stunted at the tweenie-I'm-10-years-old-level. Miki and Angelina's other favorite activity is getting into slapping, screaming fights. I wanted to bang both of them over the head with a cast-iron skillet.I am flabbergasted by this book. It is well-written, the pacing is excellent, the storyline was engaging, and the shapeshifter paranormal aspect was superb. I love shapeshifter books, and Laurenston does a great job with the animal instincts and pack behavior. But it's extremely difficult to stomach a book where the major characters are unlikable jerks.The worst part of the book for me was the final-declaration-of-our-love scene. Zach is attempting to tell Sara he loves her (which is freakin' hilarious, since all these two have done for the entire book is ball each other...how the heck they've \"fallen in love\" has escaped me), but he keeps getting distracted by the sight of her naked arse. Sara answers a ringing phone, and has a chirpy conversation with her bud about how Zach is trying to profess his love for her. Cute, right? No, not really. Not charming, not cute, unless you are maybe 8 or 9 years old. These two are now the alpha leaders of this wolf pack? This pack is so totally screwed.After just finishing Molly Harper's adorable werewolf book, this one fell flat for me. The humor and characters were too immature for an adult paranormal romance. If anyone knows of a Shelly Laurenston book where the characters are more likable, speak now or forever hold your peace. I'm willing to give her one more chance, but I want a sure thing.

The banter between the heroine and her two friends had me laughing so hard. That was quite an unexpected treat. This is a story about a female wolf shifter who is unaware of her heritage. She's the kind of heroine I love. Smart, feisty, strong without being a ball buster. She's scarred and walks with a limp, so she's not your conventionally pretty heroine. The hero is a tall, dark motorcycle riding wolf shifter. He's ultimate alpha male, but doesn't go far with his chest-thumping or possessiveness. The story is set in a small town in the west where it seems most of the people are shifters. I would read more books from this author. This was the first book of hers I read. I like her style and humor. Highly recommend this book for those who like paranormal fiction."}, {"userName": "Ronda  Tutt", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2216375-ronda-tutt", "userReview": "FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC! SCORCHING HOT EROTICA!This book was the greatest read, I haven't ever laughed so hard in my life from a book. I literally had tears running down my face at some of the interaction between Sara and her two friends along with the Magnus Pack. I was hooked immediately and couldn't put the book down. Sara and Zach's romance was perfect and their erotic scenes were totally HOT! I loved Sara's kick ass attitude and action and her friends were just as awesome. Zach made the perfect Alpha male. Shelly Laurenston now has a new fan, I look forward to jumping right into the next book in this series."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34530235-carol", "userReview": "4 stars.Sexy and captivating paranormal romance.

In fact, I\u2019m more apt to DNF a book before I\u2019ll rate a book that low. While I technically did DNF this book around the 70% mark, there\u2019s no way that I couldn\u2019t give this book a one star. I was so outraged and offended\u2026..it pretty much deserved it.First of all, I want to say how excited I was for this series. I thought that it was going to be similar to the Psy-Changeling series by Nalini Singh, and the ratings were super high on Goodreads. It sounded awesome! It wasn\u2019t.This book actually started out really good. It seemed like the two main characters had a lot of chemistry and would really work out together. I really enjoyed how Sara seemed to be having a reaction to Zach that would eventually lead to their mating. Pretty soon, though, she was acting like she hated him, which was SO WEIRD because she was acting like she couldn\u2019t resist him for most of the book. And then all of a sudden she could & she didn\u2019t like him and blah blah blah? Where did that fit in?My absolute biggest 100% complaint with this book was the complete disrespect to females. There was such slut shaming going on in this book\u2026.mostly between the females. Okay, sometimes it\u2019s not that big of a deal for friends to jokingly call each other names. That being said, Sara DID NOT LIKE being called a whore or a slut. THAT IS NOT OKAY. If you\u2019re friend obviously doesn\u2019t like it, DON\u2019T DO IT. I wanted to punch those girls. And THEN, they acted like she was completely overreacting by getting upset. Like it SHOULDN\u2019T bother you to be called those names. THAT IS NOT OKAY. I am OUTRAGED.And it wasn\u2019t just the females who were slut shaming, it was also the males slut shaming the females. And, for real? If Zach called Sara a bitch ONE. MORE. TIME. I was going to lose my shit. Don\u2019t let your man talk to you like that! What the hell? And guys? Don\u2019t let females talk to you the way that Sara talked to Zach. Seriously\u2026.there was NO RESPECT in this book.Another thing that really bothered me in this book was the absolute cheesy storyline and sarcastic writing. It\u2019s like the author was trying to be funny 100% of the time, and it ruined any seriousness that the book could have existed. And since the writing was like that 100% of the time, all of the characters blended together and had no uniqueness or individual personalities. PASS.Overall, I\u2019m really disappointed and disgusted in this book. I will NOT be continuing this series!"}, {"userName": "DarienMoya", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3069494-darienmoya", "userReview": "^^SOCIALLY CHALLENGED!^^What a surprise Pack Challenge was, I thought I would kinda like it but I ended up liking it a lot. It won\u2019t be for everyone, because the females are a little bit unrefined, and the story is far from spectacular. I did laugh though and I came to a realization, that I really enjoy my h/h unrefined (by unrefined I mean; brass, bold, and without polish).Sara has scars on her body and in her heart. She finds it hard to trust, and only has a handful of close friends. She lost her parents at a young age and the scars on her body are proof of her survival. As the immense pain caused by the accident, which left the scars on her body, intensifies, Sara is finding it hard to pretend anymore. How long can she keep up the drinking, and finding reasons to get in to bar fights? Until a group of bikers show up on her home turf, and the sexy Zach makes an appearance. Sara starts feelings things, and she is feeling like an animal.Zack does one thing and one thing only protects his pack. He has job to lookout for a female who has no idea she is a shifter, and he is finding himself wanting this woman with a serious chip on her shoulder (more like a branch). Zack knows Sara is one-step from crazy, but he wants her bad. He came to Texas to do job, not to find a mate and her crazy friends.Therefore, to add some action, another bunch of shifters wants Sara dead in the name of pride, honour, revenge and all that. A crazy lion shifter cannot let bygones be bygones. Sara deals with being a wolf shifter like pro, which explains why her fuse is so short and easily combustible. In addition, why she feels like an animal when it comes to Zack and all she wants to do is rut, rut, and rut some more.I liked the fact that Sara is one crazy B.I.T.C.H, with an attitude problem and no manners to speak of. Sometimes all these perfect heroines becomes tiresome, here\u2019s a woman with flaws and all that. Zack is sexy, and knows how to throw down, nothing surprising here. I look forward to her friend\u2019s book cus they be crazy. I realized that I like my women crazy *who know*. This is light fluffy and will go buy in no time, if you looking to laugh a little then this book is for you."}, {"userName": "Carolyn F.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2624012-carolyn-f", "userReview": "Just a comment before I even read this book, I wish it were just about 1/2 inch longer on the bottom. I'm just saying. Fantastic book. I just love Sara, Miki and Angelina. They are so funny and great together. Sara is a girl who works in a motorcycle shop. She meets Zach at a bar where Miki is the bartender. Angelina has some kind of shop, but they don't really talk about it. Sara gets drunk, some guys try to kill her, Zach saves her and Sara kisses him as thanks. Now he can't get her of his mind. The Pride that killed her mother and father are after her and Zach is trying to save her because her mother and father where in his Pack. Although Sara knows nothing about this because Grandma didn't tell her. I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series.

It's the first book in a trilogy & the first Shelly Laurenston that I've read & believe me, I will definitely be reading more.Sara works at a chopper shop, chills with her outrageous & slightly psychotic pals Angie & Miki & is completely unaware of her unusual heritage. She is a slightly damaged, very aggressive, antagonistic girl who has no idea how attractive she is to just the right male. Zach is a hot shapeshifting wolf, soon to be Alpha of his pack, the pack that Sara's parents used to belong to. Zach arrives in Texas with his pack to protect Sara from the pride of shapeshifting mountain lions that killed her parents.The plot is simple but well drawn & effectively developed for such a short read. The pace is just right, the dialogue is wicked, especially between the three friends, sarcastic, humouress & bitchy & the banter between Sara & Zach also had me laughing out loud. The sex is incredibly hot and steamy and the language while realistic for the characters, is rude & crude so delicate readers consider yourself warned.

Though the story was short, it didn't seemed rushed at all. I loved the characters and the interesting development of the story. In a nutshell, Sara is raised human by a local pack alpha--never knowing shifters exist. As she matures, her aggression as a (pack) leader becomes a very dominant emotion in her life. Unbeknownst to her, she has 3 different pack looking out for her well being...then there is a pride of lion shifters who want her dead. As her body and mind begin to change, she sees herself as more than the \"crippled\" wallflower she as been her entire life.Looking forward to sassy Mikki's story...her yummy little love interest is up for a major challenge...can't wait for that to unfold.\u2733\u2733 Reviewed on I \u2665 Bookie Nookie Reviews___________________________________________________If you like this type of book, you might enjoy one of these groups.
