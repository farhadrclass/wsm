Translator Michael Hoffmann describes the Weimar Republic as a tiny period of history, (1918-1933) with \u2018a whiff of fragility, of scandal, of doom about it. \u2026 an interval of tremulous republican government, between monarchy and dictatorship, between one catastrophic war and the approach of another; but most of all a period that was fast and febrile and fun\u2019.It was characterised by political violence, assassinations, unemployment, crisis and instability. Berlin, the setting for most of these pieces, was sprawling, ungainly, a place \u2018created for the purpose of existing\u2019, already an island city well before the 1960s, outside the rest of Germany and Europe, morally ugly and chaotic. Popularised by Isherwood, it became practically synonymous with the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties and a totem for Weimar. Roth, a journalist all his life, was passionately committed to \u2018saying true things on half a page\u2019 in the feuilleton form and saw himself as painting the portrait of his age through them.Originally from Galicia then Vienna, Roth moved to Berlin which he hated \u2018but permitted it to exercise him. \u2026 the perspectives he seeks out are those of the unfortunates, the people who fall between the cracks, the immigrants, the Jews, the released lifer\u2026, the homeless living and the nameless dead. Those who appalled him were those \u2018of organized Berlin, as a centre of fun, of transport, of government, of nightlife and literary life, and of sports. His natural sympathies were with the outcast and the underdog and Berlin gave him plenty\u2019. (p17)Hoffmann notes that the collection is \u2018varied and purposive, \u2026 and covers the breadths of his concerns admirably. It even seems to pick out a sort of narrative line, widening and darkening from airily whimsical beginnings to take in exile, assassination, the spread of fascism and the uncertain prospects for German-Jewish civilization\u2019 (p13). Perhaps it's a difference in approaches to humour, but I found the humour heavy rather than whimsical, borne down by the weight of Roth\u2019s disillusion, whether the subject is nature, railway junctions, skyscrapers or nightlife.It\u2019s clear from the first story that Roth does not love this city. As I read further, antipathy towards Berlin, its government and society, is the dominant tone. His prevailing mood is dark. In the first piece 'Going for a Walk\u2019, he describes himself as a curmudgeonly soul. Throughout, the writings tell a story of disillusion and antipathy, his emotions ranging through melancholy, outrage, anger, despair; Roth\u2019s writing is brilliant. The vivid pictures he created in words are wonderfully enhanced in this collection by archival photographs that connect with the subjects of the feuilletons."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5273746-mark", "userReview": "These newspaper pieces are incredible, in some ways so much more approachable than his fiction. HIs novels, so wrapped up in bitterness and irony, are somewhat less affecting than his sharply observed journalistic pieces. Roth saw and noted everything in Weimar Berlin, and his observations are frequently chilling. One piece in particular jumped out at me: in The Steam Baths at Night, from 1920, Roth anticipates with sickening clarity the events in WWII that he did not live to see:\"The grotesque spectacle of a hot room at night, containing sixteen naked homeless people, trying to sweat out the soot and coal smoke of a train journey, gives rise to a positively infernal range of interpretations. A series of illustrations, say, to Dante's journeys in the underworld. The only creature permitted to be fully clothed, standing there purposefully and conscientiously with scrubbing brush and torturer's gauntlet in hand, could quite easily be some underdevil, if you happened not to know that his infernal character will be appeased, and his true character revealed by a small tip, once you have withstood his torments.\"Later, in the 1929 essay Architecture, he writes:\"It happens from time to time that I fail to distinguish a cabaret from a crematorium, and pass certain scenes actually intended to be amusing, with the quiet shudder that the attributes of death still elicit.\"Roth's vision was horribly accurate, but it's a mercy that he did not live to see his visions come to pass."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james", "userReview": "This is the wonderful selection of essays by Joseph Roth collected as What I Saw: Reports from Berlin 1920-1933. In this selection of \"reports\" by the novelist and journalist Joseph Roth, best known for his masterpiece The Radetzky March, we are presented with a picture of the Weimar Republic through the eyes of one of the finest writers of the twentieth century. Roth was a young foreign correspondent for various newspapers, only twenty-six years old, when the earliest of these pieces was written. During the period he would also write some of the novels that have brought him posthumous fame.The reports in this selection chronicle the underside of Berlin including Jewish immigrants, criminals and others. There are 34 pieces organized by topics such as Displaced Persons, Bourgeoisie and Bohemians, Berlin's Pleasure Industry and Look Back in Anger. In the essay \"The Kurfurstendamm\" he writes, \"In the evening I walk along the Kurferstendamm. I slink along the walls like a dog. I am on my own, but I have a certain sense that destiny has me on a leash. . . . And so the Kurfurstendamm stretches out endlessly day and night. Also, it's being renovated. These two facts need to be emphasized, because of the way it's continually ceding particles of its true self to its designated cultural-historical role.\"It is the essay of the last section, \"The Auto-da-Fe of the Mind\" that resonates in my memory looking back on my reading of this book. Let me quote:\"Let me say it loud and clear: The European mind is capitulating. It is capitulating out of weakness, out of sloth, out of apathy, out of lack of imagination . . . Now, as the smoke of our burned books rises into the sky, we German writers of Jewish descent must acknowledge above all that we have been defeated.\"The essays in this book ring loud and clear over the decades and they bring home to the twenty-first century a sense of the life and decay of the era witnessed by Joseph Roth."}, {"userName": "AC", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac", "userReview": "This book consists of a collection of 34 of Roth's feuilletons (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feuilleton), each of which runs roughly 3 or 4 pages, mostly from the early 20's, tiny slices of daily life in Berlin, with the last from 1933 discussing the plight of Jewish writers in the \"Auto-da-F\u00e9 of the Mind\" of Nazi book-burning. Many of the pieces are charming, but they are light - though the first one (\"What I Saw\") contains a remarkably concise statement of the spectacularization/commodification of nature that Dubord himself must have read and admired. It is quite interesting. Michael Hofmann's introduction is also quite interesting."}, {"userName": "Al Maki", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20454189-al-maki", "userReview": "Roth's reports of life in Berlin in the aftermath of the Great War. Like his other work, it contains a mix of the humane, the sardonic and the funny. There were two currents in the book that I was particularly struck by. It's partly an account of the lives of the people whose lives were shattered by the collapse of three European empires: the German, the Russian and the Austrian-Hungarian. I was struck by how much their lives resemble those of the people fleeing the chaos in the middle east today. I hope they find a writer of Roth's gifts to describe their situation. It's also an account of a city in the process of modernization: traffic jams, giant department stores and mass entertainment were new phenomena at the time and Roth's descriptions of them are worth reading for their freshness and insight.I have imagined this period in German history as little more than a cabaret show, a prelude to Nazism, but reading a contemporary account it comes across quite differently, as a vibrant world, confusing, crass, harsh, but full of possibilities that were not realized."}, {"userName": "\u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20729246", "userReview": "\u0394\u03b7\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03c9 fan \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0393\u03b9\u03cc\u03b6\u03b5\u03c6!\u0395\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1,\u03bf \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03ae... \u0398\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ce \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf Hotel Savoy (\u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf)"}, {"userName": "Sharon Barrow Wilfong", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16212447-sharon-barrow-wilfong", "userReview": "These brief chapters are written as though Roth had a Go Pro camera strapped to his forehead. He describes all the sights, sounds, smells and people he sees as he walks through the streets, shops, bath houses, police stations and morgues of Berlin in the years between the World Wars.He starts with the Jewish Quarter, then takes us to see the homeless. He describes the modernization of Berlin with the development of skyscrapers and architecture. This was written in the early 1920s. Little could he realize that any further development would come to a standstill for the next eighty years when East Berlin became part of a Soviet Bloc country.Roth describes bourgeoisie and Bohemians and amusement parks and museums. He ends with foreshadowing the rumblings of the rise of Hitler and makes some acute observations about the capitulation of the Protestant and Catholic churches and the ousting of Jews. He asks, do these \"Christians\" not realize that Hitler is murdering Christ when he murders the people who produced Him? He makes an interesting comment about President Hindenburg. Hindenburg bragged that he never read a book. Roth comments, if someone doesn't read, is book burning far behind? He also asserts that the majority of the German literati were Jewish.When the Nazis rose to power, Roth left for Paris in 1933. He lived there until his death in 1939. He drank himself to death, due to his disillusionment and hopelessness over the condition of his beloved Germany.It's too bad. If he could have held out, he would have seen Hitler's ultimate demise and the fall of the Reich six years later."}, {"userName": "Boyd", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1907260-boyd", "userReview": "This is a superb collection of Roth's impressionistic newspaper dispatches from Weimar-era Berlin. It's a sort of walking tour of the city, but unlike writers of other such works, who tend to be warmly appreciative, Roth displays a real ambivalence and even antipathy toward Berlin. Many of the his sketches are little vignettes of human unhappiness and dislocation, yet despite his crabby pessimism his prose is beautiful and full of poignant and funny images. In \"The Steambaths at Night,\" a fat man \"might be advised to borrow the equator from the earth as a belt for his dressing gown.\" In \"The Very Large Department Store,\" the merchandise assumes a doleful character because \"where there are so many things close together, they can hardly help not thinking of themselves as precious. In their own eyes they shrink, and they lower their prices, and they become humble, for humility in goods expresses itself as cheapness.\" (This must explain Walmart.)  Roth displays scorn for many of the trappings of modernity while writing about one of the most radically modern cities of the time. He despises urban traffic and the mechanical conveyances that snarl it; he sees the city itself as \"a distressing agglomeration of squares, streets, blocks of tenements, churches, and palaces\"; he visits a Berlin nightclub \"not to cheer [himself:] up... but to take a malicious pleasure at the phenomenon of so much industrialized merriment.\" Yet his portraits are sensitive and nuanced, and the early photographs of the city are wonderful.A fabulous, deceptively complex little book."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29405459-cheryl", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. The author wrote these essays/articles from 1920-33 for German newspapers. They are a descriptive account of what he saw in Berlin. The writing was so good. It is descriptive, poetic, sarcastic and in some cases comical when you realize he is making fun of something. I plan on reading more of his work."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20785080-jess", "userReview": "I tried to read this for my coursework, so this abandoning is long overdue."}, {"userName": "Murtaza ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13716226-murtaza", "userReview": "This book consists of a number of short newspaper vignettes published by Joseph Roth when he was working as a journalist in early 20th century Berlin. Having said that, this is not \"journalism\" in the sense that we usually think of today. Rather, they are simply Roth's observations from walking around town and visiting the various small and large sites of interest in his city. As he writes in \"Going for a Walk,\" one of the first vignettes:\"It is only the minutiae of life that are important. Strolling around on a May morning, what do I care about the vast issues of world history as expressed in newspaper editorials? Or even the fate of some individual, a potential tragic hero, someone who has lost his wife or come into an inheritance or cheated on his wife or in one way or another makes some lofty appeal to us? Confronted with the truly microscopic, all loftiness is hopeless, completely meaningless. The diminutive of the parts is more impressive than the monumentality of the whole.\"Roth really does have a gift for observing the small details of life. He sorts through the clutter of the modern world, observing all its small absurdities and trivialities, and proclaims that, \"in the face of a sunshine that spreads ruthlessly....whatever is heralded our touted can only be of little weight or consequence.\" The ultimate task of an artist is to have their finger on the pulse of reality and give expression to what they observe, and he does that impeccably in many of these short essays. My favorite ones were \"Going for a Walk,\" \"The Resurrection,\" a vignette about of old man encountering the machinistic clamor of the modern world after spending 50 years in prison, and \"The Large Department Store,\" which as its title suggests is simply Roth's reflections on the architectural and moral implications of such a store opening in his city. Roth also has a well-established gift for depicting the lost Eastern Jewish communities of Germany, and does so again here to great effect in the \"The Orient on the Hirsenstrasse,\" the product of an evening spent observing the traffic in the city's Jewish quarter.The vignettes provide a fascinating insight into how an intelligent and observant person viewed changes in their society during the 1920s and early 1930s. But what really distinguishes them are the beautiful writing and metaphor that Roth employs in making his observations. Light doesn't just come into the room through the blinds, it pools in like \"bars of gold bullion.\" The mute objects of daily life are enchantingly anthropomorphized. Traffic lights throw \"temper tantrums\" of green and red, while the lives of the city's passerby are imagined in a way that transcends \"the inaudible, sleeping melody of a distant, even unreal life.\" This is a rare gift for a writer and it is a pleasure to read.None of these reports were never written with any intended larger purpose or aim. They were merely Roth's daily observations for local newspapers. But they are arranged here in a way that forms a teleology of German history of that period. Roth starts the book carefree, walking through a city he clearly loves and which he feels himself to belong to. But as time passes, the vignettes show a foreboding of the dark times ahead for his city and for Jewish intellectuals like himself. Beginning with the assassination of Walter Rathenau (a deeply intellectual and sensitive man who is movingly eulogized in one of the vignettes), before heading to a visit to the Reichstag to observe the competing political factions, the book concludes with a final essay written from Paris that serves as a j'accuse towards the Nazi Party and Germany as a whole. The Nazis ended up burning the books of Roth and other German Jews on pyres in the middle of the same Berlin that he once walked and lovingly depicted. Through his anger Roth saw the irony of this, but he also saw, somewhere in the yawning distance, that he and his contemporaries would one day be vindicated by history - as they were.All in all this is a fascinating slice of life of a very important time and place in 20th century history. But for those who write or simply enjoy good writing, there is a lot of aesthetic beauty to reflect on here."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6032685-shelley", "userReview": "This book should be required reading for voters in the U.S. 2016 election and for anyone interested in history and the essay form of writing. This is not a history book, per se, it is a collection of short essays published in Berlin newspapers, but it gives a rare view of a certain time period that has relevance to today's political situation. I don't know if it's partly the art of translation or what, but the writing itself is beautiful. Not at all like our typical cut and dried just the facts style of newspaper writing. Mr. Roth wrote novels in addition to writing newspaper reports so I guess that's why his writing is a big step up from the usual journalism. His sensitivity and sensibilities seem very modern. Many of these pieces would be believable as blog posts from the current era. He simply spent time walking around the city and documenting his feelings and experiences.Mr. Roth focuses on the real life experiences of people and places in Berlin at that time, everything from the cabarets to the department stores to the homeless shelters. His work documents there was hostility towards the Jews as well as nationalist violent behavior in the 1920's, way before the time we usually think of it starting. Mr. Roth died in 1939.

W. Norton & Company in 1996 and translated into English by Michael Hofmann in 2003. \"Roth, unlike any other German writer of his time, ventured beyond Berlin's official veneer to capture the essence of the city, chronicling the lives of its forgotten inhabitants - the war cripples, the Jewish immigrants, the criminals, the bathhouse denizens and the nameless dead who filled the morgues - as well as more whimsical aspects of the city - the public parks and the burgeoning entertainment industry.\" (Roth, 1996)In What I Saw, Roth passionately writes of his observances in the city of Berlin, Germany during the Weimar Republic, the democratic government in place prior to the reign of Hitler and the Third Reich. The words Roth writes paint a very good picture of the various environments he saw as a journalist. I was alerted to this while reading the second page of the book where he described watching as a beggar discovers a nail file; he wrote \u201cA war cripple who finds a nail file. Someone, a lady, has lost the nail file in the place where he happens to sit down. Of course the beggar starts filing his nails \u2013 what else is he to do? The coincidence that has left the nail file in his possession and the trifling moment of filing his nails are enough to lift him about a thousand social classes, symbolically speaking.\u201d (Roth, 1996, p.24) I thought that was excellent writing and it really got me interested in the book.Throughout the reading, I felt as if the police and some other state officials in the stories were very empathetic with the lower-class Jewish people. When writing of the homeless, Roth writes \u201cAll the officials were humanity under their uniforms. Anyone called upon to supervise misery will view criminality differently. All state officials should be required to spend a month serving in a homeless shelter to learn love.\u201d (Roth, 1996, p.65) \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Roth both loved and hated Berlin. Love-hate is a most tantalizing approach, and it catches one with flashes of grim significance in the midst of enjoying the pleasure and humor he finds in the ordinary as he walks the streets of Berlin. \u201cWhat I see\u2026What I see is the day in all its absurdity and triviality.\u201d (Gordimer, 2002)I felt sorry for Roth, being a German Jew journalist in an anti-Jewish country. The Jews worked very hard to contribute to a promising society in the Weimar Republic and they were treated horribly by many Germans who feared influential roles and overall power was transferring away from the German people. With the rise of Hitler and Nazism, most of the Jewish business people fled to the United States, the United Kingdom, or other countries and those who stayed behind either ended up in concentration camps or jail. Roth writes \u201cWe German writers of Jewish extraction are the first to have been vanquished for Europe. We at least are not guilty of blindness or falsehood. All we have is honor \u2026!\u201dI highly recommend What I Saw: Reports from Berlin, 1920-1933 as a rare historical glimpse into the auspicious souls from exotic Weimar Berlin.Roth, J. (1996).

These are not political, but more about everyday events or, better, random musings.The book starts with some articles about Jews - refugees from the East (Poland, Hungary and many from Russian POW camps following WWI) and their area in Berlin, including an article about a model miniature rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon.There are then a series of articles on various locations or events in Berlin that have caught Roth's attention - night dives (cafes etc), the homeless refugees, the steam baths, the police morgue, the traffic system, new buildings and the pleasure industry.These sometimes soar, such as the article on skyscrapers:\"It is impossible for the proximity of clouds to have no effect on human beings. The view out of the window, taking in the full boundlessness of the horizon, works on both heart and soul. The lungs take in the air of heaven. Clouds wander past the brows of mortal man as previously only around the brows of Olympians.\"and\"Oh\u2014 and already you hear that the first skyscraper in Berlin is to contain a great entertainment palace, with cinemas, dance hall, bar, Negro bands, vaudeville, jazz. Because human nature will not deny its weaknesses, even where it is seemingly in the process of overcoming them. And if it were possible for us to build a \u201cplanet scraper\u201d and to construct settlements on Mars, the expeditions of scientists and engineers would be accompanied by a delegation of bartenders. I have a shining vision of a bar in the clouds. It\u2019s raining champagne cocktails.\"Sometimes the effect is far more prosaic, but still enlightening of a different time.The final, longer essay written in 1933 and published in Paris after Roth's \"voluntary\" exile when the Nazis came to power is about the Nazi rise to power. This is a powerful essay and although it is easy to be clever with hindsight, this was wise at the time. The article opens:\"Very few observers anywhere in the world seem to have understood what the Third Reich\u2019s burning of books, the expulsion of Jewish writers, and all its other crazy assaults on the intellect actually mean. The technical apotheosis of the barbarians, the terrible march of the mechanized orangutans, armed with hand grenades, poison gas, ammonia, and nitroglycerine, with gas masks and airplanes, the return of the spiritual (if not the actual) descendants of the Cimbri and Teutoni\u2014 all this means far more than the threatened and terrorized world seems to realize: It must be understood. Let me say it loud and clear: The European mind is capitulating. It is capitulating out of weakness, out of sloth, out of apathy, out of lack of imagination (it will be the task of some future generation to establish the reasons for this disgraceful capitulation).\"Overall it is a powerful collection and, through the overall impression of the times it portrays, is more than the sum of its uneven parts."}, {"userName": "Alec", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5729058-alec", "userReview": "The 2004 book cover by Norton & Company features a Dadaist foto-montage which the conservative scribe Joseph Roth would likely have despised. Yet this cover is appropriate since the foto-montage embodies the b\u00eate noire which Roth denounces in his writings: Modernity. A political reactionary, Roth loathes Modernity itself. He grieves for bygone monarchies, denounces \"ill-considered newspaper articles\" which \"undermine the authority of the police\" and tut-tuts \"the undisciplined character of the postwar generation.\" He views \"cinemas, dance halls, bars, Negro bands, vaudeville and jazz\" as grotesqueries; he laments the illogical charades of modern times. Such denunciations are uneven in quality and wholly polemical.Despite such reactionary screeds, Roth's articles about rapidly-vanishing Old Berlin are nonetheless interesting and poignant. He is confused and heartbroken by what he sees. His sorrow for the passing of the old ways of life is \"like the grief of some antediluvian creature\" mourning \"the disappearance of a prehistoric habitat.\"During one of these extended bouts of mourning, one wishes Roth might have encountered the more pragmatic H.G. Wells who would have pleasantly reminded him: \"Adapt or perish, my dear fellow, is Nature's inexorable imperative.\""}, {"userName": "Jos\u00e9Mar\u00eda BlancoWhite", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28440635-jos-mar-a-blancowhite", "userReview": "Extra\u00f1a traducci\u00f3n del -por otra parte- altamente valorado escritor espa\u00f1ol Eduardo Gil Bera.

I'm interested in the thoughts and observations of ordinary people as they lived through two world wars and the time between and after. Joseph Roth was a German reporter, and this book is a compilation of his newspaper columns and daily observations in the early 1920's, a difficult between-the-wars time in Germany. I liked his mini-stories and essays on daily life in Berlin, and found them fascinating in view of the fact that we now know the Nazis would soon be in control. But his columns became more and more cynical because of the path Germany was taking, and understandably less fun to read. Before long he left his homeland for a more enlightened environment in France...and wrote columns of a totally different tenor from there. At least for awhile....See the next book for that."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764456-kat", "userReview": "To be honest, I did not finish reading this book.I didn't dislike it, it just wasn't what I was looking for. It could have been my own problem for just loaning out this book at the library, without a care for what it really is. In any case, I believe this could be a very good book, once my own mindset has been adjusted.I was looking for a more academically-approach history book (I'm not sure what I mean by that). This, however, is a collection of essays by Joseph Roth. I couldn't really understand well much of the context of his essays. I believe I have to familiarize myself with the whole pre-war and war situation in Germany first, in order to understand some of the nuances in the essays.So, I'm returning this book to the library for now.

Joseph Roth provided a detailed glimpse into the lives of the people of the capital city. His talent as a writer and his sensitivity to the human condition were useful tools for creating short essays on life in Berlin. Those people lived in the analog world which stressed face-to-face conversations, bicycles, buses, books and newspapers not the Internet and smart-phones. Roth\u2019s writing preserves the scenes of daily life in Berlin. Roth described miserable war refugees, people with heavy baggage riding the trains. He shares with his readers the sweating, shouting, spectators at the all-night bike races. On page 96 he tells about riding the train and what he sees when the lights come on at dusk, \u201cIts illumination is oily and greasy.\u201d The book was required reading for a class I took."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2747745-chris", "userReview": "Brilliant little pieces done for German newspapers in the 20's. Witty observations on Berlin society are leavened by Roth's sympathy for, not only the outcasts of that society, but the prosperous bourgeois too; as they are tossed about by a city supposedly built to serve their pleasures.Roth's sardonic observations darken as strident politics appear near the end of the book, with nationalist election rallies, and visits to the Reichstag and the home of the assassinated Walther Rathenau. The final piece, written in Paris, is a deeply serious and eloquent denunciation of the violence that drove him and many other Jewish writers out of their homeland."}, {"userName": "Jacob Benjamin Paramore", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44729814-jacob-benjamin-paramore", "userReview": "\"What I Saw\" is a powerful book giving insight into what it must have been like to live in Berlin between 1920-1933. From the beginning of Wiemar to the uprising of Hitler, the essays collected in here show a vast amount of emotion and intellect from the eyes of an Austrian Jew. The diction is poetic and flows very much like one short story to the next, providing an easier read for those not capabe of pushing through historical text. There is joy, such as the marvel of the Skyscraper, and there is sorrow, such as Genadierstrasse (Grenadier Street) becoming \"one Wailing Wall after another.\" Joseph Roth saw an awful lot."}, {"userName": "Peach Berry", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27522208-peach-berry", "userReview": "a very beautiful and rare insight into daily life in Berlin, as seen through the eyes of writer Joseph Roth. from his experiences of German Nightlife, his apolitical satire to a particularly poignant piece about the persecution of Jews in 1933, What I Saw reads much less like a piece of historical non fiction and more like several untold stories.Roth's writing is wonderful, humour-filled and poignant in many places. I particularly liked some of his musings about people and characters that had so easily left their mark from his long observations. A fantastic read and well worth a look if you're interested in that era, the last piece though, will stay with you."}], "description": "The Joseph Roth revival has finally gone mainstream with the thunderous reception for What I Saw, a book that has become a classic with five hardcover printings. Glowingly reviewed, What I Saw introduces a new generation to the genius of this tortured author with its \"nonstop brilliance, irresistible charm and continuing relevance\" (Jeffrey Eugenides, New York Times Book Review). As if anticipating Christopher Isherwood, the book re-creates the tragicomic world of 1920s Berlin as seen by its greatest journalistic eyewitness. In 1920, Joseph Roth, the most renowned German correspondent of his age, arrived in Berlin, the capital of the Weimar Republic. He produced a series of impressionistic and political essays that influenced an entire generation of writers, including Thomas Mann and the young Christopher Isherwood. Translated and collected here for the first time, these pieces record the violent social and political paroxysms that constantly threatened to undo the fragile democracy that was the Weimar Republic. Roth, like no other German writer of his time, ventured beyond Berlin's official veneer to the heart of the city, chronicling the lives of its forgotten inhabitants: the war cripples, the Jewish immigrants from the Pale, the criminals, the bathhouse denizens, and the nameless dead who filled the morgues. Warning early on of the dangers posed by the Nazis, Roth evoked a landscape of moral bankruptcy and debauched beauty\u2014a memorable portrait of a city and a time of commingled hope and chaos. What I Saw, like no other existing work, records the violent social and political paroxysms that compromised and ultimately destroyed the precarious democracy that was the Weimar Republic.", "title": "What I Saw: Reports from Berlin 1920-1933", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57791.What_I_Saw", "average": 4.07, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388190177l/57791.jpg", "reviews": 49, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/30681.Joseph_Roth", "name": "Joseph Roth"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16118708.Michael_Hofmann", "name": "Michael Hofmann"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/126234.Michael_Bienert", "name": "Michael Bienert"}], "type": ["History", "Cultural", "Nonfiction", "Writing", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57791.What_I_Saw", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30300913-1920-1933", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/430645.What_I_Saw", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21024724-what-i-saw", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19012264-what-i-saw", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25087832-what-i-saw", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8344635-el-juicio-de-la-historia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54258.The_Radetzky_March", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57785.Job", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/819535.The_Legend_of_The_Holy_Drinker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57792.Hotel_Savoy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57787.The_Emperor_s_Tomb", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
