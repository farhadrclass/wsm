What can we say that hasn\u2019t been said countless times before? The man has had such an influence and his books are simply imperative reading for any human being. Powers and Prospects collects Chomsky\u2019s lectures in Australia in the 1990s which were supposed to cover East-Timor. But we get so much more.Unfortunately, the first two chapters have Chomsky either at his most philosophical or academic, and they\u2019re a bit difficult to follow. These deal with human knowledge and linguistics. As far as I could understand, Chomsky makes the point that the human language is just a \u201cpoorly\u201d designed software to communicate the language and images we create in our heads, topics discussed extensively in Stephen Pinker books (which are based on Chosmky\u2019s work). After the first two chapters, the bulk is dedicated to topics all related to the crisis in East-Timor.Like most of his books, this one is a tour de force as Chosmky discusses a wide range of subjects ranging from the responsibility of intellectuals and the double standards we apply to them depending on what position they take on their country, the meddling us the US in foreign countries\u2019 affairs and trying to promote the right kind of Democracy (Nicaragua and Indonesia are just some examples), how US policy is the opposite of popular preference (and yes, that includes Clinton's policies), the problems facing the middle east and Palestine, and a thorough discussion of the crisis in East-Timor and how it\u2019s fueled by American greed and fear of communism. What Chomsky stresses throughout is that, especially in the case of East-Timor, the problem is easily solved as long as the population puts pressure on the US to withdraw. At least that's what I could gather on a single reading, because Chomsky\u2019s writing is so dense and detailed that we would benefit from repeated readings to uncover the layers of this onion. Noam Chomky\u2019s books are vital because they improve our understanding of the world around us. Powers and Prospects is no different."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/846698-doug", "userReview": "Perhaps not amazing for those who have a much greater knowledge of the history of science, but for me, amazing -- and I'm judging this by the first two chapters, going against etiquette, I suppose, but I can only review what I've read...Anyway, if you want to know more about the mind-body problem, as Descartes knew it, and the collapse of the mechanical philosophy via Newton's assessment of \"occult forces\" at work, e.g., gravity, as well as language's place in all this, read, I say.

Chomskys point is that \"[t]he responsibility of the writer as a moral agent is to try to bring the truth about matters of human significance to an audience that can do something about them.\" He draws as examples the atrocities that occurred in East Timor and Cambodia at almost the same time and of roughly similar dimensions relative to population. The contrast between media coverage and moral outrage regarding events in Cambodia, and the media black hole that the events in East Timor disappeared into, is doubly disgusting when one takes into account that the Indonesian dictator was a US ally, supplied with US aid and weaponry (and when congress cut that other Western countries took up the slack). It would have been possible for the U.S. and the West to have brought to a halt the atrocities in East Timor (as in fact happened in 1999 though nearly twenty-five years after Indonesia invaded). Instead Government and media outrage was focused on Cambodia, where leverage was approaching zero, and the culprits were ostensibly Communist.\"Goals and Visions\" reflects on the need to be pragmatic about distinguishing goals from what is, more or less, immediately possible in a given context, and the need to have a vision regarding how a decent and fair society might function. \"Democracy and Markets in the New World Order\" is a cogent summary of post \"Cold War\" developments in the economic sphere. \"The Middle East Settlement: Its Sources and Contours\" is a summary of the early stages of the \"peace\" process, prescient in that Chomskys appreciation what was happening and of how it would evolve has been largely, and rather depressingly, confirmed by subsequent events. \"The Great Powers and Human Rights: the Case of East Timor\" and \"East Timor and World Order\", the last two essays in the collection, are directly relevant to the situation in East Timor, and describe events there within a global context.Prefacing all the essays outlined above are two essays on Language and Linguistics that frankly appear out of place. I suspect there is a minimal amount of correlation between an interest in global affairs and linguistics; it is certainly not necessary. No doubt someone who reads it for the linguistics will end up doing some interesting and unexpected reading. The majority who will read this primarily for Chomskys analysis of global affairs, and whose knowledge of academic level linguistics is somewhat spartan, will find themselves scratching their heads. That small criticism to one side, there are a number of excellent essays in this collection, some of a very high standard and well worth reading."}, {"userName": "Siv30", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5260037-siv30", "userReview": "\u05de\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9. \u05e1\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05e8\u05ea \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05e0\u05e2\u05e8\u05db\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dd \u05d4\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05e4\u05e1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9. \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8\u05d7\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05e4\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05e2\u05dc \u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05e5 \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05d0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7 \u05d8\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05e8. \u05de\u05ea\u05e7\u05e4\u05ea \u05de\u05d7\u05e5 \u05e9\u05de\u05ea\u05d0\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05d2\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05dc\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5 \u05db\u05de\u05e2\u05d8 10 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05d0\u05d6 \u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05d9\u05de\u05d5."}, {"userName": "Angelbaghdad", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24870482-angelbaghdad", "userReview": "soogood"}, {"userName": "Doron", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19479558-doron", "userReview": "Always provocative and thought provoking"}, {"userName": "Mario Russo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46820306-mario-russo", "userReview": "Reflex\u00f5es bastante abrangentes sobre pol\u00edtica externa americana.
