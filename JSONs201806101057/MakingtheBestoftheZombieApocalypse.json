I've read Flesh Eaters, and Zombie Gras by Alisha Adkins, and loved them both. She is quickly becoming one of my favorite horror/zombie apocalypse survival writers. Therefore I was excited when she gave her approval for me to read a review copy of Making the Best of the Zombie Apocalypse. Unfortunately, I found the book very underwhelming, at least compared to the other books that I've read by her.Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy most of this book. As much as it was a stupid decision on his part, it was interesting to see how Nathan dealt with the situation with his mother. It was also cool to see the dynamics of the group, and how everyone bonded together, even though they were completely different. That being said, there was nothing in this book to set it apart from Alisha Adkins' other books. The book had the same scenario as the other zombie apocalypse books I've read by her, rehashed with a couple of different variables. The first time I read one of her books, the cannibalism aspect was new, and intriguing. It was something that I had never seen in a zombie apocalypse book before. However, by this point it's kind of boring. It no longer holds the shock value that it once did. I'm over it. Also, the ending of Making the Best of the Zombie Apocalypse was a letdown. I was expecting something so much better, and shocking.This is the first one of Alisha Adkins' books that I've read that I didn't love. It completely missed the mark for me. However, I will continue to read her backlog because I've loved most of the books I've read by her. I can see how someone would love this if it was the first book by her that they've read."}, {"userName": "Bryan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8823313-bryan", "userReview": "An occasionally lighthearted story depicting daily life after the world has been overrun by Zombies.

This is a quick read (a couple of hours in my case which is unheard of) about life in the zombie apocalypse. It follows two people who met after it all hit the fan and shows what life is like durring this time. The book came with a bookmark that said \"Twisted tales for twisted minds\" and this qualifies. I won't give it away but this has some disturbing things in it (but I liked it so what does that say about me?). It's a bit low on action but its a nice story, almost a love story which I would recommend."}, {"userName": "Bryan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8823313-bryan", "userReview": "An occasionally lighthearted story depicting daily life after the world has been overrun by Zombies.

Was very interested about their monthly survivor meetings which i thought was very useful for social needs and abel to share thoughts and feelings about the world ending. I did however thought the end was a bit lack luster and the way the zombies destroyed the last meetings was a bit rushed and not as detailed as i would of liked but overall was great quick read lol"}], "description": "Extreme circumstances dictate extreme behaviors.
