I really hated Summer this time around which is sad since I really enjoyed her internal monologue in the first book.I absolutely loved the chapters from Graham's point of view, I would have loved to read more from him. Like Summer walking down the aisle, and the reception... I did like the fact that Jon saved the day multiple times throughout the book and I'd live to see the dress she picked out after the alligator incident... It sounds amazing. Sadly I won't be reading the next book in the series, but I will definitely be picking up more books by Beth :)"}, {"userName": "Tracie Banister", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5070200-tracie-banister", "userReview": "The fun continues in this follow-up to one of my favorite reads of 2016. A few years have passed and our beleaguered heroine is about to wed the man of her dreams . . . at his parents' retirement community. The odd and continuously problematic location, plus a spacey wedding planner and a bunch of interfering seniors, add up to one comical situation after another and a lot of headaches for the bride and groom. Sunset Havens is about the least likely place I can imagine for a young couple to get married, so kudos to the author for her originality and delightfully warped sense of humor. The obstacles Graham and Summer encounter on the road to getting hitched are increasingly hilarious, but I really felt for the poor bride-to-be as it seemed like nothing was ever going to go her way. It was nice to see that her parents, who were such a neurotic handful in the first book, had grown and were supportive of Summer throughout this story. Her mom even comes to the rescue like a champ on more than one occasion! I liked that there were several chapters written from Graham's POV so that the reader gets to see what's going on in his head during all of these calamities. He and Summer aren't always on the same page, but he really does love her and wants her to be happy.Although things don't go as Summer hoped or planned, I think they pan out in exactly the right way for her and Graham. Their relationship started out very quirkily, so why wouldn't them tying the knot be the same? The ending of this book left some loose threads hanging, so I think there may be another Summer story in the offing. I would love to see Summer and Graham with a baby. I'm sure Joan and Richard would be a riot as grandparents. (I can totally see them carrying Graham, Jr. around in The Duffle!)This was another very entertaining read from Beth Labonte that I recommend to Chick Lit lovers. You're in for a few surprises with this one!"}, {"userName": "Kim Nguyen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61951181-kim-nguyen", "userReview": "A bit over the topGot to be a bit of a tedious read after awhile.

All were equally awesome and I couldn't decide between them. So you're getting all below. :)#1It's rare to find a fellow Whovian who shouts their slight obsession from the rooftop also. Or the pages of all of their books! So when an author mentions your fandom within the first chapter of their new novel, one who doesn't normally \"squee\" finds themself, in fact, squeeing loudly. Thankfully, said \"one\" was in the car so no one heard me--I mean, \"them.\" Oh who am I kidding? It was me. Definitely me. #Whovianforlife #mykitchenistardisthemed #actuallymywholehouseis#2Imagine that you've read a book that you instantly fell in love with. The author's writing, the characters, and the hilarious story sucked you in and spit you out wanting more. Hoping for more. Dreading that more might ruin the story for you. Sequels are rarely as good as the first, right? I mean, yes, sometimes they're just below the original, and sometimes they just suck. I always go into the next book in a series with reservation and a slight expectation that this book will not be as funny or perfect (yeah, I said it) as its predecessor. Then there's that moment. You get through the first chapter and breathe a sigh of relief. So far, so good! You continue reading (or listening, in my case) and are pleasantly surprised to find that you're laughing more than you have in a long time. Possibly more than the first book in the series. Is that possible? Can the second book be even more hilarious than the first? Am I just in a better mood now so the laughing comes more easily? Could be, but I'm willing to bet that it's the story itself.#3I'm working on a blog post about book boyfriends and book best friends. I was 90% sure I knew where I stood on each, but Graham Blenderman might have changed my mind. Or maybe I change the blog post to Book Boyfriends, Book Besties, and Book One-and-Onlys? Do men like this really exist? It's no secret that I'm single. My dating history isn't too lengthy and the guys that graced my presence with their doucheness...well...\"doucheness\" should cover anything I need to say.#4Audiobooks are a glorious invention. I work a LOT so there isn't much time to read. Enter Audible (and talking iPhones, but that's another blog post that's coming). Most audiobooks that I've listened to have one narrator. Beth wrote SUMMER AT SUNSET in dual POV and hired TWO narrators. And I'm freaking in LOVE!!!See? Couldn't decide. Lol! All of that said, Beth Labonte's sequel to her novel, SUMMER AT SEA, has quickly jumped to one of my top ten books. Ever. Ok, I don't actually have a list, but I should make one. On it, you would see SUMMER AT SEA right next to her new little book sister SUMMER AT SUNSET. I'll write a blog post soon about the rest of the list. While you're waiting, head over and buy ALLLLLL of Beth's books. You won't be disappointed. If you are, I'll...ok, I won't do anything other than try to convince you that you really do like her books. Because, you've got to. Who wouldn't?Edit: I wrote the above when I had about two hours left in the audiobook. I wanted to make sure I was able to get my thoughts out before I got to the end so I couldn't spoil anything. Now I have an hour left and have to add, \"Damnit, Beth! Did you really have to go an make me cry? At work?!?\" Yes, I totally just teared up. A lot. But completely happy tears. This is just your warning to make sure you have a tissue available. ;)"}, {"userName": "Rosie", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24529029-rosie", "userReview": "After meeting Graham Blenderman on a cruise ship two years ago, Summer Hartwell is dreading her upcoming nuptials which are only weeks away. With a free wedding won by Summer and Graham, to be hosted at the luxury retirement complex where Graham\u2019s parents reside, followed by a honeymoon in Jamaica, Summer\u2019s nerves are pushed to the absolute limit while witnessing flirtatious behavior from the elderly residents towards her betrothed. Unapproved alterations have been made to her wedding dress, the wedding plans have been sabotaged, and strange accidents seem to be constantly happening to her family, but it is not until a direct threat comes crashing through the window that Summer realizes somebody has her in their crosshairs. Investigations bring shocking results, as Summer follows the clues to the culprit behind it all.Beth Labonte\u2019s second book in the Summer Series really had me scratching my head, as a simple wedding turns into a shocking, yet hilarious, game of cat-and-mouse which left me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Summer\u2019s incredible sense of humor was well honed and in perfect form throughout Summer at Sunset, causing raucous amounts of laughter in my home causing the cats to hide. Beth Labonte has a real knack of telling an exciting and entertaining story which keeps her audiences captivated from the first page to the very last. The hidden clues throughout the text made me want to re-read the book over and over, not only in case I had missed something during the first read, but so that I can relive all of the hilarity once more. I thoroughly enjoyed Summer at Sunset and cannot wait to get my hands on the third book in the series, after having read and enjoyed the first book, Summer at Sea, so long ago. I wholeheartedly recommend this fine tale to all fans of comedy-romance, mystery and suspense, and personally cannot wait to read it all over again... and again and again.- Rosie Malezer for Readers\u2019 Favorite"}, {"userName": "Rachael Benson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19123904-rachael-benson", "userReview": "HUGE Disappointment After Book #1 - Not Funny, Just RidiculousSuch a disappointment after the first hilarious book. I may have let out a short little unenthusiastic \"ha\" here or there after reading the forced writing and a few far and between supposedly funny moments in this book, but that's all. Definitely a bummer, as last time was such a riot.The situations in this story, as other reviewers have noted, are absurd. I can put aside reality when reading of course, but these situations were just so out there and unrealistic as to pull me right out of the story. Maybe one or two, but all of them?? And the ending, again as others have noted, just bizarre?? Not even a cliffhanger (especially as evidenced by the start if the next book) - just weird. Leaves the reader wondering with an alarmed and uneasy feeling. Terrible way to end a book. Finally, Summer, our neurotic heroine. I was able to roll my eyes at her annoying ways during the first book because the humor was so fantastic, but this time around there was no hiding behind her no longer funny parents. She is spoiled, immature, blames everything that happens in her life on everyone else, paranoid beyond reality, bitchy, unappreciative, jealous to a fault, and controlling. I will say she did mature an ounce by the end of this book, but her character is still nails on a chalkboard annoying. If this was real life I would be urging Graham to run for the hills! But then again, if this was real life no one in their right mind would be in a relationship with someone like Summer Eve. An almost 30 year old brat. So -- do yourself a favor and skip it. Poke around and find a better book. This one is just a giant, annoying, waste of time."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10713729-mandy", "userReview": "I love Summer.

Our main character is now engaged to be married and wins an all expenses paid wedding at her in-laws retirement community.It was nice to be reunited with the quirky cast of characters, including Summer\u2019s neurotic parents. Ironically she learns that she may not be all the different from them. You know what they say \u201clike mother, like daughter.\u201d We are also introduced to several of the residents from the retirement community, who are young at heart, enjoying their golden years in the Florida sun. Only their daily routines mirror more of a college fraternity than that of a rest and relaxation.While I found it to be an enjoyable read, I didn\u2019t rate it as high as Summer at Sea. I didn\u2019t like the characters quite as much as I did upon their initial introduction to me. Although I found it perfectly understandable that she would be stressed out, I found Summer to be a bit annoying at times and I wasn\u2019t a fan of her fiance. An inflated ego isn\u2019t a trait that I find attractive at all. The conclusion of this story was more over the top, than I expected.However I enjoy the way Beth Labonte weaves pop culture into her stories and the personalities of her characters. There were several laugh out loud moments and I especially enjoyed the visits to Disney World.I look forward to the next installment in this series and I would recommend it to fans of contemporary chick-lit."}, {"userName": "Ivonne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8012979-ivonne", "userReview": "Proper chick lit Nice and easy to read.

Sunset Havens is quite the place, full of boozing, promiscuous seniors having one last go-round in the fast lane (via golf carts). Hijinks abound, especially when the hilarious Hartwells arrive for the nuptials. This time around we get to see more of her brother as well as meet her future in-laws.But it isn\u2019t all fun and games in the Sunshine State. There\u2019s a bit of a mystery, too, as Summer is convinced someone is out to sabotage her wedding. As Summer encounters glitch after glitch on her way to getting hitched, her mother steps up, turning out to be more than just annoying comic relief.I love the relationship between Summer and her mother and would like to see that explored in even more depth in future stories.We\u2019re also treated to some scenes in Graham\u2019s point of view. This was a nice surprise. Not only does popular Graham get to explain himself and his people-pleasing ways to the reader, but we get to see Summer through the eyes of her man and his love for her. Always one of the joys of reading romance.As the couple's wedding day--and the climax of the story--draws near, the antics rev up. It almost became too much for me, and honestly, I skimmed parts of the final thirty pages or so until the final, final ending, which, when it came, seemed just plain weird and a bit dark.I would have loved more emphasis on character depth and less on wacky hijinks, especially in the final act, but that's my own personal taste. Fans of screwball may find the balance here more satisfying.There are some instances of profanity and crude sexual jokes involving Summer\u2019s bachelorette party, but generally, \"Summer at Sunset\" is a PG-13 read.If you\u2019re a fan of the first book in the series (and if you haven\u2019t read it, do!) \"Summer at Sunset\" is a fast fun time (I read it in a day, and I\u2019m a slow reader) that will have you looking forward to the next installment.

While I was TICKLED to get more of the Hartwell family shenanigans and also get introduced to the Blenderman family, I wanted more romance! I wanted more between Graham and Summer. We already know the family hijinks are going to be hilarity at its best, I would have liked to feel the connection between Graham and Summer grow. Summer wins a free wedding at Graham's families retirement community and this place is full of characters. I seriously laughed and smiled through the whole book. Beth Labonte has a serious knack for writing characters that are hilariously relatable but to the extreme. We all have those family members that make us shake our heads and Beth makes you look at those family members in a way that makes them more funny than mortifying. Just the way that Graham does for Summer. I can't even talk about the level of excitement I felt when I saw Christian Fox was added to the narration cast. He is TOPS for me and his narration added that little bit more to make this book even more fantastic. Erin Spencer nailed it in book 1 and keeps the ball rolling in book 2.

Now John and Babette are running down the driveway and everybody is hugging and shaking hands and The Duffle is being unloaded from the trunk like a coffin from a hearse, and it\u2019s all really happening now. I take a deep breath and watch everybody file into the house from the safety of the driveway. The front door shuts with a satisfying thud.

I could steal a golf cart and be at the airport in, like, three days. \nFor Summer Hartwell, holding her and Graham\u2019s wedding a thousand miles from home seemed like a good idea.

Between the swingers parties, the Viagra jokes, and the copious amount of alcohol, Summer\u2019s not so sure her parents will make it out of there alive. Then there\u2019s the matter of Graham being Grade A top choice meat to every woman over sixty-five, a few of whom Summer suspects of trying to sabotage the wedding!
