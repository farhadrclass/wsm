Like, the bulk of the summary are things that happen within the first few pages. The rest of the book is really that tiny little third paragraph, Nate and Emily dealing with their own issues, and some family issues, and the fact that they're both secret keeper extraordinaires, and not in the cool Harry Potter secret keeper sort of way.A lot of what drives Nate and Emily is their angst over not having enough money in New York. It absolutely consumes them, and they drive themselves into stress and a lot of debt just trying to keep up with their wealthy friends. On some levels, I get this; money is a huge motivating factor and it can be easy to obsess over, especially when the people you surround yourself with have much more than you do. But I hate it when people make New York out to be this mythical playground that only the uber-rich can afford. I have plenty of friends living there on very modest salaries and they love it and make it work. I even have a friend/acquaintance who has lived in Manhattan on $1,000 a month. She's even writing a book about it. Is it the same lifestyle that Nate and Emily's wealthy friends have? No, but she has fun and has amazing experiences and lives a very full life and is probably much more personally fulfilled than these two were. I just had such a hard time identifying with them or feeling any sympathy for them and their very narrow, elitist world view. I'm like, dude, move to Brooklyn or Queens or Washington Heights or something, your life does not start and end with gigantic high rises on Park Avenue. Not every book needs to have likeable characters who make smart decisions all the time; that would be boring. The Exiles features a cast of terribly unlikeable people whose catastrophic decision making nearly ruins them. Like I said, Nate and Emily are hard to sympathize with, which made me roll my eyes a lot as I was reading the book. Their problems are almost entirely of their own making, and their lack of ability to communicate with one another about important things is super frustrating. They're both nearing 40 and haven't figured any of this out yet. Proving that this phenomenon isn't isolated only to YA books, I spent a lot of time wanting to reach into the book, shake them, and tell them to use their words. Or, at the very least, get them referrals to some therapists and psychiatrists and real medical professionals instead of letting them stew in their own angst and assumptions. I enjoyed the book but I've got to admit that one of my main motivating factors for getting to the end was waiting to see who would snap first.That said, I thought this book was a great character study of all the characters involved, which is what made this a worthwhile read for me. While their start in Newport is rocky, with lies and accusations and theft and illness overwhelming them, by the end of the book you have a glimmer of hope that Nate and Emily will get their act together in the future. And in the meantime, you get to see what happens when a whole lot of stress piles up on two people and essentially breaks them. It's fascinating, and a little bit sad, with a few laugh out loud moments to lighten things up along the way."}, {"userName": "jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40158-jennifer", "userReview": "A little too much suspension of disbelief with the main plot devices and their \"resolutions.\""}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara", "userReview": "The heart of this story takes place over a 3 day holiday weekend.

They are escaping a horribly expensive lifestyle in Manhattan, where they pay $5,000 a month for a small two bedroom, 1 bath apartment.

The hollowness of this privileged lifestyle comes through in this novel, and yet, Nate and Emily are not sure relocating was the right decision. They are quickly thrown into crisis when their Jeep Cherokee and all their belongings and financial information packed in it, is stolen. To further complicate things, Nate is struggling with a secret he hasn't shared with Emily, because the time never seems right. While one of the cover blurbs used the word hilarious to describe this story, it is anything but funny.

She steals from people she is using to give herself some semblance of power and screams insults at good friends who try to help her.

At the opening of the story, the reader finds the young pair has recently been joined by an infant son, Trevor and they all are in the process of moving from Manhattan to Rhode Island where Nate has acquired a new job and a new home and hope for a new life for his fledgling family. On their first day in Rhode Island, their car is stolen along with all its contents and the saga of Nate and Emily then unfolds over the next three days.This is a story that sees two individuals, drawn together, yet seemingly unknown to each other, for each has a secret of sorts. On the one hand Nate is overwhelmed with dealing with his genetic odds at mortality and Emily is overwhelmed by her inexplicable moral turpitude. These are the fabrics of the tale. In the process of revealing the relationship between Nate and Emily, one is drawn to the fact that the lives of these young people are mainly drifting, undefined and virtually empty. The makeup of their existence to date is all materialism and it is elusive for they cannot afford the material life they try to lead. Those that Nate and Emily see as their friends are sorely derided by them in private, the dichotomy being the attempt to emulate those that seem to be detestable.The writing is good and the story moves right along. It is, however, uneventful. At least that is to say nothing happens that concludes from any rising anticipation for the reader. It is, in the end, just mildly satisfying \u2013 a chronicle of events, short on intrigue or passion but not entirely uninteresting. If you like the \u201chuman interest\u201d sort of novel, then \u201cThe Exiles\u201d should be considered reading. I would recommend you add it to your list.

I found it to be well-written -- the prose tight and beautiful -- and thought both characters were equally compelling, although, yes, as some people have mentioned, Emily is not necessarily likeable, but for me that made her real and interesting and made the conclusion of her story that much more compelling. As the book developed it got more and more tense as the characters had to face their pasts and its impact on their future and I could not put it down. The book touches on relevant questions of our time as well -- what it means to fall short of the ideal vision you have for your life as you grow into middle age, how more and more families are falling short of the prosperous \"American dream\" in this economy and the exiling nature of that, and how keeping so much of one's self secret, most notably from those closest to you, creates its own form of exile. I thought Allison picked the perfect setting to play this out, from the excess of Manhattan's financial scene to the \"townie\" side of rich Newport, making the couple move from one form of cultural/societal exile to another. That Nate and Emily find their way back to each other and finally, truly come to terms with who they are, and what they can be together, made this book especially moving for me. I look forward to reading what Lynn writes next."}, {"userName": "Mia Tat", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9112785-mia-tat", "userReview": "This is a slight stretch for me, and I'm honestly not sure what made me pick it up. As I was trying to figure out what shelf to put it on, I realized that I needed a whole new one, because it didn't specifically fit onto any that I already had. It's a story of Post-9/11/2001 NYC, economic downturn, what it means to be related to a famous person, coming to terms with grief and abandonment, starting over, greed, and how hereditary illness can re-map an entire family.The complex web of circumstances at the heart of the story and how they layer upon each other was a high point for me--I realized mid-way through the book that if any of the storylines had been the most prominent, or any of them had been left out, the book would have fallen completely flat. As such, there is a lot of back and forth, though I didn't find it hard to follow (but then, I like that kind of book). I dithered back and forth between three and four stars, and settled on four, because I think the ending was really masterful, and resolved everything as well as could be expected. It is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. The main raps I've read on it are the characters are whiney and unlikable, and the overall premise is too weird, as in, why would people need to be priced out of NYC?

I'm always sure a book I am struggling through will get better. Wonder of wonders, it did! Or, maybe I finally got invested in it. Any disease which is genetic and can be inherited is terrifying for anyone in the line and the information should be shared with anyone who could possibly receive the faulty gene. It's hell to know and hell not to know. Huntington's is horrific and there is no treatment and no cure. Most of the book is about that. There is a side plot involving stolen art and someone trying to find herself while dreaming her life away.
