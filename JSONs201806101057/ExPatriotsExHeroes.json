The story centres on the mysterious Project Krypton, which I can\u2019t really talk about in any way for fear of spoiling the story. The previous book, Ex-Heroes was a little too zombie-riffic in my view. This book still features zombies, but does so in a much better and original way. To me, this is the closest you can get to a great novel about comic book characters. The audiobook production for this series is phenomenal and one of my favourites. Final thoughtThese books are great fun and great if you\u2019re looking for something light after reading something heavy or serious. Will I give any of the next books in the series five stars? I\u2019m doubtful, but I will enjoy them. You know what did get five stars, though? Cline\u2019s 14 and The Fold, both of which are absolutely fantastic! I still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth living in a world with no more donuts.Check out all my book blogs at  http://constantreaderpauloneill.blogspot.co.uk/."}, {"userName": "Andre", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2877069-andre", "userReview": "Whenever you have an issue with a tiny aspect of something you read or watch, there often comes a fear that the follow-up book/movie/whatever will spend more time on that aspect and, therefore, infuriate you. This was the case with my reading Ex-Patriots. In my review of the first book, Ex-Heroes, I noted that the racial dynamics of the characters were bothersome. There was so much time spent introducing readers to the heroes that this wasn\u2019t a really big issue. This time around, however, I couldn\u2019t ignore it.It started right off the bat. Four paragraphs into Chapter 2, we are introduced to a young Latina who is participating in a celebratory cutting of St. George\u2019s hair. It turns out the girl is only an excuse to introduce us to Cesar, her uncle, who wants to disclose his own superpower to St. George. Cesar was previously a gang member. So we\u2019re not into Book 2 of this series and we haven\u2019t yet met a Latino\u2014in Los Angeles, mind you\u2014who isn\u2019t associated with a gang. A little later, the heroes decide it\u2019s finally time to be nominally inclusive. Of course, most of the team objects, but St. George insists. \u201cI expect to see at least one person with a tattoo,\u201d he says. When they finally choose a former gang member to go out with them, he voices his disdain for the team\u2019s new armor: \u201cShit looks gay.\u201d Come on, man.The most hilarious racial moment occurred when Colonel Shelley, the man in charge at Yuma, asked one of the heroes how they were able get chickens in the Mount. Shelley was told, \u201cThere were a bunch of families from Mexico and South America who kept them in their back yards. Lots in Chinatown and Little Tokyo, too. Some of them found shelter with a group calling themselves the Seventeens.\u201d That is practically an admission that the Mount had been free of Latinos before taking in survivors after the war with the Seventeens. It is confirmation that all the Latinos in this series are associated with the gang.At least one of them is treated like a good guy at some point. I can\u2019t say the same about Asian people. Throughout the first two books of the series, there have been three named Asian people. There are Sandra Oh, described as being \u201cThe bitchy Asian woman,\u201d from Gray\u2019s Anatomy, a Korean ex-hero who was Gorgon\u2019s underaged girlfriend and went by the name Banzai, and Christian Nguyen, a citizen of the Mount who was very anti-hero.I don\u2019t mind her being anti-hero, but Christian Nguyen represents part of how the plot was not, in my opinion, very well thought out. The survivors of the Mount had been living there safely under the protection of the heroes for about two years when the Army showed up out of the blue one day. There is no way you can convince me that in a post-apocalyptic scenario, the most enthusiastic voice of the \u201cHey! We\u2019re rescued because the Army is here!\u201d is going to be a non-White person. Not in this America.In Ex-Heroes, there weren\u2019t really any named Black characters. That changes in Ex-Patriots. In this novel, the heroes of the Mount contend with a band of genetically enhanced super soldiers from a base in Yuma, Arizona. These soldiers, the Unbreakables, are led by a Black man named Captain John Carter Freedom. This guy is a piece of work. Captain Freedom is \u201cSix-eight, maybe six-ten, easy, and built like a fucking linebacker.\u201d What a patriot this guy is. \u201cThe Army was where I was supposed to be and I was going to serve until I died. I had a duty to serve my country. The United States had fought a war against itself, spilled its own blood, so my great-great grandfather could be free. So I could have this proud name.\u201d Oh yeah, Freedom\u2019s special gun is called Lady Liberty. Writing from the point of view of the oppressed requires skill and nuance not many people have. Ugh.It wasn\u2019t just race. This book is seriously flawed in dealing with gender as well. From Danielle, who is too frightened live when not in the Cerberus suit\u2014she sleeps under her kitchen table for crying out loud\u2014to Sergeant Kennedy, who is an eager-to-pleaser under the guise of being a strong soldier, this book is downright demeaning to women. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to freak out,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cGirls freak out.\u201d The best part was this: \u201cMom says having three girls was murder on him. He loved us, don\u2019t get me wrong. He was the greatest dad in the world and he spent every minute he could with us, but it was rough on him not to have a son to keep up the military tradition\u2026I was the youngest. And the tomboy. As soon as I was old enough to understand Dad\u2019s quiet disappointment, I knew what I was going to do with my life.\u201d Right.In Ex-Heroes, I thought that Stealth was the author\u2019s sexual fantasy put on paper. This is another area in which Ex-Patriots is worse than the original. The text is fairly explicit in this regard. When Stealth asked St. George how he was able to resist someone\u2019s powers of persuasion, he told her he thought of a loophole. \u201cThat soldier hit you with his rifle. The second he did that, I realized I didn\u2019t want to beat the bad guy. I just wanted to save the girl.\u201d Stealth says to him, \u201cYou have heroic fantasies where I am \u2018the girl.\u2019\u201d And then Stealth, the stoic, aloof Vicki-Spock woman, says, \u201cAt the moment I find your heroic fantasies somewhat endearing.\u201d What? Essentially, this entire series has been a nerdy hero too afraid to tell the object of his desire how he feels about her saves the damsel in distress tale.And I haven\u2019t even brought up the Obi-Wan Kenobi zombie. That was too much for me. Had I been reading a paperback, I would have thrown it against the wall. No, man. Just\u2026no.I thought the autobiographical chapters in Ex-Heroes helped moved the plot. I felt the opposite this time. They took me out of the rhythm of the story and, in some cases, gave away too much as to take some of the intrigue away.For the most part, I did like the way Peter Clines wrote John Smith. He was actually a great character. From his first appearance, his dialogue and actions were perfect. Everything involving him was very well done\u2026until the end. John Smith had been too smart throughout the entire novel to make the mistake of creating a situation in which he could not be heard.This book was not for me. If the series continues, I doubt I\u2019ll pick it back up. Interesting concept, but not my style."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2786617-eric", "userReview": "(Does anyone remember Happy Feet?) Ramone: Let me tell something to you.Because of the length of the audiobook and the fact that I need sleep somewhere during the night to do the annoying things in my day like work I had time to put down some of my thoughts. At the time I was seriously considering dropping down to at least 4 stars due to my feelings on having such a predictable plot. Cliche some would call it. There were even moments when lines from the book that had quoted movies were about how cliche the the situation would be in a zombie-pocalypse. Looking back I must say I think it was a pretty intelligent decision. I'm not going to call it a red hearing but you definitely have to rethink it all once it happens. Now that being said I'm so glad I didn't check out because once I got back into the book on day two I realized all my gripes were me nitpicking because I felt I'd been played. I was ready to bash all the heroes over the head for their stupidity starting with the woman in black herself. All of that would've been a terrible mistake.You know I'm not going to give any of it away and I genuinely hope no one goes in looking for \"the moment\" but man after everything that had happened I was just amazed at how well it all turned out. As I said before Clines has an ability to juggling the story elements without losing the reader and keeping an eye on the situation from the present and in the past, from a lot of different POVs, all while throwing in some parts comedy, drama, action, and a couple little pop cultural references that keep you smiling. I'm a fan, honest. I know I'm new to the club but after the preview of The Junkie Quatrain I'm all in. I do have one small worry though. The rate he seems to be releasing these books (Junkie will be out \"soon\" says the publisher) I hope that it doesn't become predictable in its own right. We all known Shyamalan was amazing at once point... then... so if he can avoid that pitfall I'm all for an abundance of more.That's enough.

Ex-Patriots is superheroes with super soldiers and the left over government. Now, I don\u2019t know about you but the one thing that I have learned, from every zombie movie ever, is in a zombacalypse never trust the United States Government. But, let\u2019s see how that works out for our superhereos. \n\u201cThe real supervillians wear business suits and paisley ties with full Windsor knots.\u201d\nThis has a great blend again of a story told in the past and the present (much like LOST) to tell the story. There is a little backstory to the heroes but most of the backstory follows an extremely smart scientist and the Super Soldiers that he helped create. When the heroes discover they are not alone and there are other survivors possibly even a left over government they are excited to meet them. Barry/Zzzap is there to keep the pop culture references coming and when meeting the Army\n\u201cIf someone asks if you\u2019re a god,\u201d said Barry\u2019s voice, \u201cyou say yes.\u201d\nI loved the bad guy/guys in this. It had just enough of a twist to it that I wasn\u2019t really expecting the outcome of the story. I really like the Stealth/Saint George semi-romance that is happening and there were a few cute moments but just because you are a super hero does not mean you have any player skills when it comes to women. Both Saint George and Barry seem to find it difficult to get anything going with the lady of their choice. Stealth is a favorite character of mine now. I didn\u2019t love her in the first book but she really grew on me in Ex-Patriots. It could be because she is so smart and we got to see more of her fighting skills. I really like how she examines everything and when the \u2018government\u2019 shows up she seems to know how to ask all the right questions. She is even more personable in this one where you can see she really cares for and trusts her team. All in all this is another action packed adventure where you are not sure who the good guys and the bad guys really are. I really want to see a little more into the past of a few heroes but I really like the multiple POVs and rotating past/present story telling. Peter Clines has done another fantastic job at telling a story that seems much like a summer blockbuster. Again like I said for ex-heroes, if you are a fan of audiobooks this one is fantastic!"}, {"userName": "\u2730\u263d\u2730RaeleighReads\u2730\u263e\u2730", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17755572-raeleighreads", "userReview": "For this and other reviews, visit RaeleighReads.The saga, and misogyny, continue. Le sigh.In Ex-Patriots, we pick up our hero vs. zombie story two years from when we ended Ex-Heroes. The heroes are holding down The Mount in L.A., but they soon discover they are not the only survivors in The States when they encounter a drone while on a supply run. And you know what drones mean\u2026military.I\u2019m disappointed in how disappointing this series is turning out to be. The action scenes are a little boring and some of the characters are starting to seem one-dimensional. And someone please tell me this: why would you spend an entire chapter providing back-story for a misogynistic @ss-hat when the character is barely mentioned in the rest of the book? How on Earth does it advance the plot to spout off derogatory and violent comments towards female soldiers? Oh, it doesn\u2019t? Right. Then let\u2019s cut that. Kthanks.So, why the three coffee cups, right? Well, the hinky parts are minimal. They irritated me to no end, but they were a very small part of the whole. The majority of the book was well-written. And, um, zombies. You\u2019ve found my Achilles heel. Not sure I was ever really that subtle about it.In the first book, the characters were introduced one by one with chapters that followed their stories before the zombie apocalypse and after the zombie apocalypse. This book followed the same before and after format as the first book, but it also focused more on the heroes as a group \u2014 as a functioning unit. And that was nice to see. Who doesn\u2019t love a good ensemble cast AMIRIGHT? Zzzap, Stealth, St. George, and Cerberus really come together in this to solve problems and salvage a really bad situation.I\u2019ll say again, if you like zombies and superheroes, you\u2019ll probably like this. It\u2019s nothing ground-breaking. Some of the characters have some pretty messed up views of women.

Thus, I had pretty low expectations for Ex-Patriots and it pretty much was right in line with those expectations. In Ex-Heroes I really got to see some of the heroes develop through the \"THEN\" and \"NOW\" chapters (now that I think about it that was one of the best aspects of the \"Lost\" TV series as well), but in this installment of the series there was little else revealed about these heroes (perhaps not coincidentally, I also lost interest in \"Lost\" when flashbacks became non-character-growth focused). Both the carry over and new characters in this book seemed too one dimensional - all of the new characters were super strong drone soldiers - all of the carryover heroes were invincible and had a beyond-saintly mentality. All of the predicatable meandering between the US Army and the Heroes made all the zombies just seem like a side story, not the focus of the book, which I disliked since this was a zombocalypse book. The return of the villan from the previous book was lame, as was the newly introduced villan (whom was easily identified as a villan on the first page of the book, literally). Additionally, the motives of the villans were very unclear and illogical.I spent the last half of the book wondering how the heroes were going to stop the villan, only to be disappointed that they did not stop the villan - instead they just ran away (from a villan who is potentially everywhere) and then the book ended."}, {"userName": " Linda (Miss Greedybooks)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10696812-linda-miss-greedybooks", "userReview": "I read this to my husband, it was a fun read.

Clines is trying so, so hard to make characters that are Diverse and Representative, but in so doing is only highlighting his own internal biases all the more. So we have Stealth, Female Character #1, incredibly beautiful, sick of being objectified--so she spends all of her time in a mask not using her real name because she's sick of men just falling in love with her all over the place. Yeah. OK. Do you know an incredibly beautiful woman in real life who is sick of being objectified? I'll bet you do. I know a lot of them. Do ANY of them SPEND THEIR LIVES IN MASKS? No. They don't. Why? Because as it turns out, Mr. Clines, being an \"incredibly beautiful and intelligent woman who is sick of being objectified\" is only part of a full personality. Other motivations, other feelings, and the need for basic fucking human interaction do come into play. Same with Danielle. Oh good, she's a doctor! And she wears an enormous fighting soldier suit that makes her all but invicible! Go Dr. Ass-kicker! Except that she is a bundle of fainting terrified nerves whenever she is not in her suit. So Danielle gets to be the Girl Who is Very Smart But Still Fragile and Scared. And that's it. That's her entire personality. But it was Captain Freedom who really did me in.Captain Freedom, the Black Character. The character who is Motivated by Freedom Because His Great-Grandfather was A Slave. Can you come up with anything more offensively racist. I read about his back-story and his need to fight for Freedom everywhere because of the history of slavery in his family, and I saw the rest of the book laid out before me: Captain Freedom, fighting for the wrong side because they represent the old government of the US, the government who (formerly enslaved but then later) freed his great-grandfather, and who apparently has no mixed feelings or ambivalence due to the significant residual racism in the US since that time, but wait! This army he is fighting for! They have enslaved the superheroes! Then he will switch sides and join forces with St. George and Stealth, and they will win the day. Nothing could make it clearer that Mr. Clines does not see people of colour or women as actual people than his insulting portrayal of them as one-dimensional cut-outs motivated by nothing more than some half-assed understanding of one part of their racialized or sexualized experience.This isn't a book about zombies.

Superheroes + zombies: it's a novelized comic book, and it reads like one. I thought the first book (Ex-Heroes) was pretty cheesy and mediocre if enjoyable. The second book is also cheesy, maybe just a notch above mediocre. Clines's writing has improved in this sequel, and it particularly shows in the plotting. Instead of a dumb boss fight with a predictable conclusion at the end, there are several fairly clever (if very much conforming to standard superhero tropes) twists, some of which made things that initially had me rolling my eyes suddenly become more credible. The battle at the end is more complex and has more factions and is left a little bit inconclusive (well, in typical genre fashion, you can't ever have a villain decisively killed).In Ex-Heroes, we were introduced to a gang of superheroes who were defending \"The Mount,\" a fortress inside what was once Paramount Studios in Hollywood, where human survivors have barricaded themselves against the zombie hordes that have overrun the world. In this second book in what is obviously meant to be an ongoing series, we're introduced to a group of \"super soldiers\" who were engineered by the U.S. Army just before everything went to apocalypse. Led by \"Captain Freedom\" (yeah, yeah), they discover the Mount when they fly a predator drone overhead. The heroes send out Zzzap, their energy form hero, and soon the superheroes are meeting the super-soldiers, there is the obligatory initial misunderstanding leading to a completely unnecessary hero battle, followed by the two groups deciding to join together, followed by the discovery of sinister secrets, a hidden bad guy, a returning foe, and more \"killing dead zombie celebrity\" jokes.I gave the first book 3 stars; I give this one 3.5. I don't think Peter Clines is going to be putting out anything really fantastically well-written or brilliant, but although falling a bit below my usual quality threshold for series I want to keep following, I have enjoyed both books enough that I will probably snap up the next book when it's released.

I was wrong...in my opinion, it was better. It would be best for a reader to read the books in order, as there is not a lot of character development for the Heroes we were introduced to in the first book.

I especially enjoyed Agent Smith & Captain Freedom as new characters.The Ex-series is very self-aware that it is pulpy good times, and makes constant references to movies, comics and even some Buffy references, all with a wink and a nod. It's to the author's credit that while the subject matter is serious, it never takes itself too seriously. That doesn't mean the book doesn't stand on its own - it does a very good job of doing so. You grow to really like the characters, who are well written, and the setting does a good job of making you feel like you're surrounded by chattering teeth and the characters may get eaten at any moment.

The first book in the series, Ex-Heroes, introduced us to quite some cool stuff. The first being superheroes, the second being zombies and not to forget chock-full of action! In Ex-Heroes, Peter Clines had created a interesting view upon both genres and his envisioned superheroes weren't cliche at all, he gave each one of them a bit of twists and turns (and yes, you will undoubtly see familiarities with the more famous ones). But Peter Clines does drop a few humorous and mocking hints in the story. In Ex-Patriots the story picks up a few year after the events of Ex-Heroes having defeated the threat of the Seventeens. And it's business as usual for the survivors and superheroes living in the Mount, trying to get by for just another day. They are still scavenging the outskirts of Los Angeles for food and other useful items, but even for the survivors the zombiepocalypse is being a more than dire situation. Now during a regular screen, some of the superheroes stumble upon a military drone and Zzzap, makes contact with the military. To everyone in the mount this news comes as a big relief, as with the promise of more power, they will be able to survive. But even though the army is to some a relief, other still remain a bit reluctant about the whole situation. Because why hadn't the military made themselves known before? This really is the start of Ex-patriots and proves to be just as it's predesscor, an enjoyable action packed readMost of the superheroes that we have seen in Ex-Heroes make a recurrent visit in Ex-Patriots. You have The Mighty Dragon AKA St. George, Stealth, Zzap and Cerberus. St George is I think the more prominent hero of the book and a lot is being told from his perspective, he also has the ability to lift heavy objects, breath fire, fly and is unable to get bitten by the exes. Stealth though she doesn't have flashy superpowers she is a bit of the mastermind behind all the heroes coordinating their next moves. Zzap is for me one of the coolest heroes out there, able to turn his body into pure energy and move accordingly so. Cerberus is a suite of battlearmor and operated by a human. Now I was really hoping that with being this being the second book in the series that there would be more exploration on the side of the heroes, but unfortunately it wasn't at the level I had hoped it would be. Of some heroes we do get to learn more, and with Zzzap being one of my favorites I was happy to learn about how his powers work exactly and how he had evolved them a bit in the end to use it in another way. More over the heroes do remain of what they were in Ex-Heroes. But the wonders haven't left the world just yet as Peter Clines introduces one new superhero in the mix \"The Driver\" able to reanimate mechanical stuff like cars. Now you might be wondering is that a useful superpower? Well the heroes of the mount don't think so... The Driver' power won't handle a bunch of exes... And he gets discarded, however in the end there is a nice follow-up involving The Driver and he just comes to show that he has an unexpected versatility in his powers. The way the Peter Clines described these scenes and the conversing with Zzzap and Danielle and what happened after was a fun to read. Now the for the element that makes Ex-Patriots go round. The U.S. army and their base called Krypton. Well we all know to which superhero this relates. Secretely the army has been making their own superheroes. Drug and other chemical stimulants to boost their muscle powers, making a set of supersoldiers. After various attempts only a few have become super and their leader is called Freedom. Now as a reader you might think whats all the fuss about. Now that America has supersoldiers they can save the day again. Well it doesn't go quite like that. Because early on you learn what their real motives are and if America can't control it... no one should... But back to Freedom and his buddies. These guys are massive and obey any command said by their superiors but even by this, Freedom is the one who does have the most personality of the bunch. A lot of guilt made him where he is now, he wanted to become the soldier his father would be proud of. You can't fault Freedom with a lack patriotism. I was very pleased with how Peter Clines came to show the military, it wasn't a straight forward set-up and in revealing the plot line there were quite some twists and turns and as you got further up the rungs it got a bit more intricate. And then there is an even bigger twist. One of which the bad guy of the army couldn't have imagines and one that hit our superheroes out of the blue as well! this was good stuff. The way the story is told is being done in a similar way as Ex-Heroes with the Now and Then times, cleverly introducing flashback moments for showing the history of several characters and how their actions or events they lives by led up to the actual set of events in the Now time. Peter Clines does introduce an engaging way of telling the story in this way, when I read these parts I always try to relate them and sometimes you do see links with it a few chapter back. Next to this there is also a bunch of humor and a lot of pop culture references, like referring to marvel or DC superheroes, like with Captain Freedom and a shield, but also a lot of places and other stuff that is being visited in Ex-Patriots. Some of the readers might think that it is too much or doesn't fit, but do come to think of it, it was a zombiepocalypse that hit our time so out stuff should be in there. THe ending of the book is full of smashing and grabbing, fire breathing, and guns. Even though the story was set up in a clear way, I did find the ending of it all a bit to abrupt like it was more of a episode on the television, it was done and the heroes returned home. I would have liked to have seen just that bit more of producing either a cliffhanger or some more closeness, I have no clue as to how Ex-Communications will pick-up. Ex-Patriots is a more than fun and action packed mash-up of zombies and superheroes. It had to live up to a great start of the series and in terms of really taking the Ex-Heroes series further, it didn't quite do it for me. Overall with Ex-Patriots being the second book in the series it could have used the foundation of Ex-Heroes to it's fullest, but didn't quite come through in terms of character development and getting most out of it. However the story that is being introduced in Ex-Patriots with the U.S. army trying to make a coup of it all has many great moments and Peter Clines does use the superheroes as they were in shown in Ex-Heroes, determined and with some cool and flashy moves. I think that the essences of the Ex-Heroes books are to entertain and with all the humorous scenes and pop culture references that Peter Clines introduces it does manage to do that in the fullest. It's a lot of fun to read."}, {"userName": "C.T. Phipps", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5873287-c-t-phipps", "userReview": "Despite my desire to get this in audio-book, I got caught up in so much that I had to wait until I could get it in Kindle form. I only finished it about a half-hour ago and I am now ready to give my thoughts on the work. I'll try and avoid spoiling anything more than you would normally get from the back cover and instead talk about what I enjoyed and felt could be improved. For those who like their reviews short and sweet, here's the short version: Ex-Patriots is a worthy sequel to Ex-Heroes and continues the story in an enjoyable fashion that not only progresses the story but also has some nice social satire that works surprisingly well. To get the obvious comparison out of the way before the book begins, Ex-Patriots seems inspired (at least partially) by George Romero's third zombie film Day of the Dead. Peter Clines is well aware of this and nicely acknowledges his inspiration in the text. At the risk of using an overblown comparison, he does Day of the Dead right. As most fans of the Romero Zombie films know, DOTD didn't turn out the way George Romero wanted. Having envisioned a story about how the government and military would deal with the problems of zombies, budgetary issues transformed it into a story about eight guys dealing with the zombie apocalypse. Some of which, whom, were soldiers. It's a testament to George Romero's skill as a filmmaker some interesting points about the military, isolation, and society were still made despite general agreement it's the weakest of the initial four movies. Peter Clines, unrestricted by Hollywood budget, gets to expand the response for how the military deals with the situation. Likewise, as he's stated in numerous interviews and the book's afterword, he's not interested in vilifying the military either. Instead, he strikes a careful balance between treating the military as mostly fundamentally decent people and the fact that their training and rules are ill-suited to the Post-Apocalyptic world of Ex-Heroes. Ironically, I think Peter Clines gives some nastier and more cutting satire of the military than he might have had he treated them as the \"EVUL military\" zombie movies usually do. The army's \"Stop Loss\" program and internment being justified under real life present-day laws works as a much more powerful indictment of current abuses of power than any amount of DOTD \"evil soldiers\" could. This is not Independence Day jingoism, also referenced in the book, and we see that the military is able to mount an effective offense against the zombies but is not able to win. It's a nice medium between the usual, \"the military would utterly crush a zombie apocalypse\" and \"the military is too stupid to beat the zombies\" which seems to be the usual two extremes faced in zombie fiction. World War Z, for example, has plenty of detractors for its depiction of the US military's handling of the situation. Honestly, I think plenty of people will disagree with Peter Cline's depiction of the US armed forces but they at least are allowed to keep their dignity despite their role in the book. Ultimately, though, the book is about the superheroes of Ex-Heroes as opposed to the military base they find within the confines of the book. Zzap, Stealth, Saint George, Cerberus, and the new character of the Driver are all given ample screen time. Amusingly, I like to think of this book as the third and fourth trade paperback of the series as much as I do it as a novel. The book feels even more comic book-y than its predecessor and that's not an indictment. With the zombie apocalypse out of the way, we can focus more on superheroes kicking butt and taking names. If there's one complaint I have, it's the fact that it's a little TOO much like a comic book in terms of character development. Despite being almost a year after the events of Ex-Heroes, the characters are pretty much where we left them. Saint George is still pining hopelessly for Stealth, Stealth is slightly less frosty but still keeping everyone at arm's length, Queen Bee is still offering herself to Saint George for guilt-free sex, etc. I wouldn't mind if Peter Clines did a little more character development in terms of everyone's relationships and where exactly they're going. The new character of Captain Freedom is a bit over-the-top for the more grounded characters of Ex-Heroes but is a worthy addition to the ranks. I'm less sold on the Driver but still liked him despite having less background on him than others. Frankly, the oddest thing I have to say in this review is I'm pleased that Peter Clines included an ethnic minority as a major character. Not enough books remember to do that. I really enjoyed Ex-Patriots and if this was a comic book then I would buy every issue. I am officially on board with the series and will state that I am sure this book is about equal with the original. Even if I don't like some of the elements, these complaints are very mild. The book is a fun mixture of action, heroism, social satire, and comic book references that make it delightfully fun even when the situation is grim and horrible.10/10"}, {"userName": "Mihir", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229652-mihir", "userReview": "Review originally over at Fantasy Book Critic ANALYSIS: After reading Peter Clines excellent debut Ex-Heroes, I was very excited to see where he would take the characters and the world he had written about, in the next book. As is the case with most successful debuts, the sequels come up high anticipation and therein lies the quandary for the author as to come with a story which will resonate with the readers and give them something from the previous book and also at the same time head the characters in a new direction. It\u2019s a tight rope act and one which has to done precisely as there are no second chances.Peter Clines\u2019s sequel to his exhilarating debut is titled Ex-Patriots and focuses on events a year later after what has happened in Ex-Heroes. The Mount community has more than doubled in its size due to the influx of immigrants from the other side. The Heroes have had their share of losses but their workload has even increased and now there\u2019s a bit of resentment being aimed at the heroes by someone who believes they are taking away their civilian choices and rights. Things however look up as they celebrate Independence Day and people have a good time. Their celebrations are noticed by a military drone which brings out two choppers of US soldiers. These soldiers aren\u2019t just the ordinary kind, they are from the project Krypton headed by Dr. Emil Sorrenson. They prove their capabilities and invite the heroes to their base as the Cerebrus armor is something which would be invaluable to them. On arriving at the Krypton base, things start going southwards as the heroes learn of certain things. But the main question is who is the real villain amidst all these events and what does this mean for all the humans still living in the Mount?Sequels are always hard things to write however the author does the smart thing by sticking to his original successful formula of structuring his story and making sure that the readers instantly feel reconnected with the characters, however the new thing which he does is that he shifts the location of the action from Los Angeles to Project Krypton out in the Arizona desert. This shift causes a change of scenery as well as helps in widening the focus of the story and giving the readers an outward look at the events which have been happening. This pattern was very reminiscent of Matthew Reilly\u2019s Scarecrow novels wherein the first two books had a similar plot structure but were in diametrically opposite environments.The characterization is again top notch as we re-enter the lives of the POV characters picking up from where the readers were left off & the fit is smooth. This time however the flashback then sections focus more on the newer characters thereby giving us a fresher look at the story but this move also detaches a bit of the attachment to the primary characters. As this time around its the new characters who are the recipients of the \"Then\" sections.This book had a primary drawback which was that during the middle portion, it tends to have a lull in the action and robs the story of some of its energy as well as the tension. This move while explained in the climax seems premeditated but somehow doesn\u2019t quite come across so clearly. There\u2019s also the addition of the new characters which aims to bring new zeal but some of the these characters aren\u2019t as intriguing as the earlier POV ones. Also some of them don\u2019t get enough time to develop as the story restricts their flashbacks. There's also a major plot point from the first book of which there is no mention over in the sequel & I hope the author does address it in the next one. These points might be something which were noticed only by me and many wouldn\u2019t be bothered by them however anticipation often is a double-edged blade. The ending however redeems these points completely as the author reveals his final twists which will definitely surprise many a reader and continues the tie-in with the overall all series arc.CONCLUSION: Peter Clines\u2019s sequel aims to please all new as well as the previous readers however the overall execution didn\u2019t come across as envisioned. But the book is still a great effort and continues the excellent story begun in Ex-Heroes. Ex-Patriots is a crackerjack of a sequel, continuing in the same vein and yet delivering a thoroughly refurbished product in which readers can get lost in. Its an excellent middle book & now I can\u2019t wait to see how it all ends in Ex-Communication."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Those who have read Ex-Heroes know the scoop from the first book. Peter Clines has created a world with his own flavor of superheroes, led by The Dragon (St. George), Zzzap, Stealth, and Cerberus, who reside in \"The Mount\", a barricaded movie studio in L.A. They live there protecting the bulk of survivors in the city from Ex's, aka zombies that have taken over the world. I felt that the author created a wonderful and highly detailed group of heroes and villains, using the writing technique of going back and forth in time, from 'now' to 'then' and back again, revealing only what the reader needs to know about each character-their origins, what brought them to where they are now, their motivations, etc.-until absolutely necessary to the plot. I loved the twists in the first book, which gave us a surprise ending I thought was quite a zinger. The heroes are unique, complex, and entertaining-there are no cookie-cutter duplicates of other heroes we already know and love. The second book introduces the military to the equation. But not just the regular military, a group of super-soldiers created by a government scientist named Dr. Sorenson, who has turned them into physical specimens capable of great feats strength and speed. They are led by Captain Freedom (his actual real last name), though he isn't draped in the American flag throughout the book. He is a physically massive soldier who is the strongest of the super-soldiers and also the most moral of the military men the reader is introduced to here. The military, huddled at a secret base in Arizona, makes the trek to the Mount after discovering the barricaded safe haven. Despite an introduction filled with missteps, the heroes agree to make the trip back to Arizona to discuss mutual survival plans with Colonel Shelly, the top army officer still alive, and Agent Smith, the only representative on hand representing the U.S. Government. Naturally, more conflict between the military and heroes occurs, with the military wanting the large, robotic Cerberus machine and official control over the Mount, claiming that Marshall Law is still in play. This despite serious questions as to whether the U.S. government even still exists, given that the ex's seem to control most of the world. New villains are revealed here, as well as new heroes, and the author does not disappoint with his efforts to provide fresh twists and turns to the plot, both with new characters and old. He uses the same format of 'now' and 'then' to divulge choice details, which leaves the reader guessing on particular details until the moment is just right. The action is on par with the first book, and the relationships between the different superheroes and the soldiers are solid. I particularly like the slow burn that is going on between St. George and Stealth-the two hero leaders who can't seem to figure out what type of relationship they're supposed to have. Like the preceding book, this was a well written tale and it leaves plenty of room for more twists and mysteries in the final book in the trilogy. Villains that are complex and despicable, heroes that may seem indestructible yet are very much human in how they react and respond to the people and challenges they face...Mr. Clines has created a compelling world filled with fascinating characters. I look forward to seeing where it all leads."}, {"userName": "Tenoko1", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4150850-tenoko1", "userReview": "I really love this series, so far. This is book two in the \"Ex-heroes\" series. I know I read one review about it that gave the book a low star rating and the entire review ranted about the racism in the book, and how it was worse than the first book. There isn't any. Some people just like to find reasons to complain or get offended for no reason.I really enjoyed this book. It opens up to a celebration that had you proud of both the heroes and the people of The Mount, that they have survived and pulled together, and created a community where life actually feels hopeful. Little while later, for the first time in two years, they actually make contact with soldiers from the US Army, surprising both parties, as neither knew the other even existed anymore. Soldier had given up finding survivors, and the heroes had thought any semblance of the government destroyed. As you know from books and media, and as the characters know from the same sources, be wary of the government, especially at the end of the world, and they're right to be wary, because things are not as they appear, and not everyone within the military is thinking of protecting what's left of the American people.There is one soldier that I was REALLY hoping would get eaten. He is not an evil villain with a mask and plots, he is just your basic misogynistic arrogant prick who does nothing but internally hate on women and deems them as completely and utterly lesser than he is, using every degrading insult his small mind can manage. This is not an exaggeration, also prepare for lots and lots of crude profanity when you are enduring his narration. Thank God only a chapter of the \"Then\" regarding the Super Soldiers was narrated from his point of view.Also, Christian, the female representative who hates all superheroes, is still apart of the story, but only makes one or two appearances. You may still hurt yourself with how hard you roll your eyes and groan when she shows up. I really can't stand that woman or people like her.I really recommend this book and this series.

So I went back and re-read what I had written, and thought to myself \u201cI should read the next book if I liked it so much.\u201d I was waiting for the library to send my several reserves anyway, so why not: did the on-line thing, and started in.Not much in the way of praise, I know, but that\u2019s what you get with books that are sequels and genre fiction to boot. The truth is, we can only ask if the second book in a series carries the momentum of the first. Because, of course, no one is going to like, or even read, a second book if they didn\u2019t like the first one. Ex-Patriots, I am happy to report, sufficiently continues the Ex-Heroes story.More or less, Ex-Patriots is paint-by-the-numbers, but it\u2019s a template Cline invented himself in the first novel. I mean, have you ever liked a book enough that you wanted to read it again? If you liked Ex-Heroes, you can read it again in this sequel.(And if you liked my review, just apply it to this second novel as well.)Some people disparage genre fiction, so to them I offer that Cline is a better writer than your average genre fiction author. Other people see genre fiction for what it is: built in tropes that provide materials for new stories. To those people I report that Cline does more than just take advantage of the available tropes; he develops them into something new. But let\u2019s be honest; people who don\u2019t like genre fiction aren\u2019t going to come anywhere near the Ex-Heroes series. Good. Who needs those judgmental jerks.

Very enjoyable and time will fly by while driving or doing chores listening to this production.The story itself, a sequel to Ex-Heroes, is pretty good, taking the heroes into conflict with a isolated platoon of soldiers, many of whom have super-powers due to a hidden government lab.
