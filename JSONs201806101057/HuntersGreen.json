Not sure if I want to qualify it as romantic suspense, mystery or gothic, or equal elements of all three. I liked how the author peeled back the layers of the back story and character bit by bit, instead of an instant info-dump at the beginning of the story."}, {"userName": "Moonlight Reader", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5664767-moonlight-reader", "userReview": "Open Road managed, apparently, to secure the rights to Whitney's backlist and is issuing them in groups with lovely new covers. The first round released on 7/4/17, and includes this book as well as Domino, Black Amber, The Turquoise Mask, Poinciana, Blue Fire, & Vermilion. I bought this one, as well as Black Amber, to dip my toes back in the Whitney waters.I simply cannot remember which of her books I read during my teen gothic phase, when I devoured Whitney, Holt, and Mary Stewart, so this may - or may not - have been the first time I read this book. I did not like this one nearly so well as The Window on the Square, which is my favorite Whitney so far - I tend to like historical gothics more than contemporary gothics (even if contemporary gothics are sort of historical documents at this point, being set in the 1960's - 1970's).This one also didn't completely work for me in terms of the suspense element. It was a long time developing, and wasn't ever really convincing. Those aspects of the story seemed disjointed. I could see where the story was going, but it never really seemed to get there. The main character, Eve, was mostly annoying, and the \"hero,\" Justin, wasn't particularly appealing.From the perspective of nostalgia, though, it was a winner. Whitney wasn't a fabulous wordsmith (she was no Mary Stewart, for example), but she was a solid writer in the American gothic romance potboiler style. I miss the writers of the 1960's & 1970's - they were all conversant with grammar and other conventions of writing, and their books weren't just sex scenes joined by a few lines of text to get us from one interlude to the next. I'm not a prude, but I'm completely over this aspect of modern romance. I bought Black Amber when I bought this one, so I may give that one a go next."}, {"userName": "Cheer Papworth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/527351-cheer-papworth", "userReview": "My son just brought home a Phyllis Whitney book from the school library and it reminded me of what a wonderful, fun author she is!

It also seems like they really are NASTY for the majority of the book...and not in that attractive dark brooding Heathcliffe/Nicholas VanRhyn type of way either...just complete cads and crotchety jerks...At least in this book, he had some reason to be angry. But it occurred to me, as this is my 4th book by Whitney, that her heros always seem to act crabby for so much of the book that I cannot see that any sensible woman would want to have anything to do with them. Anyway, I just had to scream that out, and now that I have,I give this book 3 stars for the suspenseful ending, as well as for the fact that the villain's motive as well as the eventual identification of the villain was at least not as obvious as in some of the other books I've read recently. Still, I am looking for another of her novels that can compare to her Sea Jade, which I really enjoyed (although he was a grouch, too!)"}, {"userName": "Pamela(AllHoney)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/884792-pamela-allhoney", "userReview": "I read Hunter's Green back in the 70s and still remember a lot about the story.

It is definitely my favorite book by Phyllis Whitney thus far.

The well-travelled author always did a great job of creating atmosphere and location in her books, which are set in different parts of the world.A young American woman named Eve is mysteriously summoned back to the English estate Athmore. It is not a happy return as her marriage to Justin North had ended on a decidedly negative note two years earlier but when she receives a letter from his cousin Julia she feels implored to return. Unfortunately, there may be an ulterior motive behind it, a deadly motive. Although Eve has no real hope of rekindling her relationship with Justin, and he appears to be seeing another woman, Eve finds she can't turn off her feelings for him, and the sinister intentions of someone on the property casts the shadow of fear and suspicion. Like every other gothic and/or romantic suspense story, there are other characters who could easily have their own reasons for setting such a deadly trap and some red herrings, and our heroine must try to keep herself safe as well as to solve the mystery, before it's too late.For the most part, I enjoyed the book, although I suspect some readers will find Justin's attitude toward Eve and his treatment of her appalling at times and tiresome. The most aggravating part is that he doesn't seem to even consider her side of the story, and it's hard to understand what Eve sees in him at times.An enjoyable read that may prompt you to check out other books from this author."}, {"userName": "Julie P", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1255833-julie-p", "userReview": "I've been a fan of Phyllis A. Whitney for a long time, so my reviews of her books are not necessarily the best by which to judge how good a book actually is. I grade through nostalgia: for the time of which she writes, and also for who I used to be when I read this book for the first time. I have to admit that it has been many years since I read this particular book, but I did enjoy it - even this second (third or fourth, perhaps?) time around. While the heroine may aggravate many a contemporary reader with her sometimes passive attitude towards how she is treated and viewed, the fashions of Mary Quant and other 60's fashion trends as described in this book will win over many a reader. If you're looking for a good, relatively contemporary Gothic romance for a rainy, gloomy day, then check out Hunter's Green."}, {"userName": "Heather Gilbert", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7169046-heather-gilbert", "userReview": "This is the kind of cozy book I like to read to wind down after a long day. Character-driven suspense is my fave, and this one is set in Britain, to boot .

I was caught upon a chessboard, a helpless pawn in a game of life and death, and the green rook was hunting me. That tall rook of green-black yew who had it in his power to destroy the king and end the game...\" When Eve North returns to Athmore after three years' separation from her husband Justin, she finds the great estate-and Justin himself-vastly changed. Eve too has changed. She knows now the mistakes she made in her marriage in the past, and she now dares to win back the love of her own husband. Like another Eve, she wanders into the gardens of Athmore, unsuspecting. Yet she has reason to fear. Justin's brother Marc had once before placed her in a compromising position in that place of secrets-the green velvet room. Justin had believed Marc and never forgiven her. Now Marc waits for her at Athmore. Then, too, she has been warned that Justin has made up his mind at last to divorce her in order to marry Alicia Daven-the cool, serene Alicia whose quiet assurance comes from generations at Grovesend, and who has always taunted the American Eve with her tempting of Justin. Old Daniel-just before he is sent to his death-tries to warn Eve. It is he who carved from the green-black yew a topiary garden, one of the marvels of Athmore. The dark trees are clipped into the shape of chessmen, at a game forever in play. The black rook stands poised in readiness, like a hunter ready for the kill, challenging the white king. Daniel cries to Eve, \"It's the black rook's play!\"--but he dies before Eve can learn his fateful meaning. Eve finds herself entrapped on a chessboard of evil, unsure of her next move, yet aware that the black rook will move again-this time to destroy her."}, {"userName": "Yue", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5098373-yue", "userReview": "More like, 1.5.It was boring.
