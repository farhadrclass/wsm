Publi\u00e9 en 1836 aux USA, il vient d'\u00eatre r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9 l\u00e0-bas, et traduit pour la premi\u00e8re fois en France. Il s'agit d'un m\u00e9lange de conte philosophique et de satyre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine de l'\u00e9poque.On nous y relate l'histoire de Sheppard Lee, jeune homme ais\u00e9 du New Jersey, qui suite au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son p\u00e8re, h\u00e9rite d'un riche domaine mara\u00eecher. Bien d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 se la couler douce et \u00e0 dilapider la fortune familiale, Sheppard Lee ne tarde pas \u00e0 se retrouver d\u00e9sargent\u00e9, insatisfait et harcel\u00e9 par ses cr\u00e9anciers.Alors que sa vie semble lui \u00e9chapper, Sheppard va alors d\u00e9couvrir (dans des circonstances que je ne d\u00e9taillerais pas pour cause de spoil) qu'il est capable de transf\u00e9rer son esprit dans des corps morts et d'ainsi les faire revenir \u00e0 la vie. Commence alors pour Sheppard Lee de nouvelles vies puisqu'il va \u00e0 partir de ce jour se chercher un h\u00f4te capable de lui apporter le bonheur.Ces divers transferts vont \u00eatre autant d'occasion pour l'auteur de dresser des portraits ironiques de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine de l'\u00e9poque. Bons bourgeois, jeunes dandys cherchant le mariage d'argent, usuriers, esclaves, ce bon vieux Sheppard va ainsi exp\u00e9rimenter diverses enveloppes et surtout diverses personnalit\u00e9s, cherchant \u00e0 chaque fois une condition qui le satisfasse.Je ne vais bien s\u00fbr pas rentrer dans les d\u00e9tails, mais le r\u00e9cit ne manque pas de saveurs. Le texte est sacr\u00e9ment irr\u00e9v\u00e9rencieux envers la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine, et chacun en prend pour son grade. Plusieurs passages sont m\u00eames extr\u00eamement critiques ou provocateur pour l'\u00e9poque. Je pense notamment \u00e0 un passage o\u00f9 Sheppard Lee propose de recycler les cadavres humains pour en faire de l'engrais afin de ne pas laisser perdre tous ces corps. On imagine fort bien l'effet d'une telle proposition en 1836...De m\u00eame, certains passages font \u00e9trangement \u00e9cho avec certaines probl\u00e9matiques contemporaines. Lorsque l'auteur (par la bouche de Sheppard) parle de politique et notamment du processus d\u00e9mocratique par exemple, ou lorsqu'il \u00e9voque l'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour lui de taxer les profits de la bourse et des banques pour les r\u00e9investir dans les h\u00f4pitaux et les \u00e9coles publiques.Il est troublant (et aussi un poil d\u00e9primant) de croiser ces probl\u00e9matiques d\u00e9s 1836, et de se dire qu'elles restent \u00e0 l'heure actuelle encore en d\u00e9bat. Cela rend en tout cas le texte \u00e9tonnamment moderne, malgr\u00e9 son grand \u00e2ge et sa narration un peu dat\u00e9e.Ce roman souffre bien s\u00fbr de quelques d\u00e9fauts, son \u00e9poque de r\u00e9daction n'\u00e9tant pas des moindres. La langue est bien s\u00fbr dat\u00e9e, et souffre de quelques longueurs et digressions dispensables. Cependant, le texte est aussi int\u00e9ressant pour le portrait de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9ricaine qu'il dresse. Les travers des uns et des autres y sont habilement mis en sc\u00e8ne, non sans humour, et sans toutefois \u00e9carter les conflits en germe de cette m\u00eame soci\u00e9t\u00e9.La question de l'esclavage revient plusieurs fois das le cours du roman, et la fracture entre Sud esclavagiste et Nord abolitionniste est \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9sente, montrant quelques d\u00e9cennies avant le d\u00e9but de la guerre de S\u00e9cession (24 ans avant pour \u00eatre exact), les vives tensions d\u00e9chirant d\u00e9j\u00e0 la population.Un roman narquois donc, mais pas que, et qui vaut le coup d'\u0153il tant pour son sujet que pour son traitement, ainsi que pour le portrait qu'il donne d'une Am\u00e9rique balbutiante en ce d\u00e9but de XIXe si\u00e8cle."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "SHEPPARD LEE Written by Himself. (1836). Robert Montgomery Bird. ****.I stumbled over this book at the library, not having heard of it previously. I learned that the author had trained as a doctor, but later turned to writing to make his living. This novel was one of his best-selling efforts, and was even reviewed by Edgar Allan Poe for the paper he was working for at the time. Poe liked it, and felt that it boded well for the future of American literature. What it is is a satiric chronicle of the life of Sheppard Lee, written in the style of a Swift or a Fielding. Sheppard was a common man who had taken up farming on the land that he had inherited. He wasn\u2019t good at it, however, and soon got into debt. Worse yet, he didn\u2019t like farming and turned responsibility for it over to an overseer. As you might expect, he was soon brought to the brink of poverty. He lost his money and his farm. He became desperate, and attempted to flee from his problems. Then he discovered that he had a certain power that lifted him away from his current troubles: He could inhabit the body of a recently dead man and become that man \u2013 leaving himself behind as a corpse. There\u2019s not a great deal of explanation on how he did this, but he could\u2026and did. This was termed, by Mr. Poe, metempsychosis. I haven\u2019t looked it up, but I\u2019ll take the reviewer\u2019s word for it. Sheppard Lee manages to make his way through several different bodies, representing several different professions and life styles. Lee always had the impression that the grass would be greener on the other side of the fence, but it was never true after he resided for a while in whatever new body he was in. Things always seemed to go from bad to worse for him. Not only is there a recitation of hard knocks in this history, but there is also a generous smattering of humor. I was particularly impressed with his last incarnation: a Negro slave on a plantation in Virginia. I\u2019m not sure if the author was trying to take a stance with this section or not. It can be interpreted in several ways. All turns out well in the end, as you might expect, with Mr. Lee having learned a lot about life and his expectations from it. This is a sleeper novel that I can heartily recommend."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "published 1836. For a longer view of what I thought about this book, you can click  here. It's definitely one of the more bizarre novels I've read as I'm going through Early American fiction this year. Sheppard Lee, Written by Himself is a mixture of satire and comedy, but each has a purpose in this novel. Just briefly, the titular character Sheppard Lee is a sort of grown-up ne'er do well who is left a prosperous estate upon the death of his father. Because he is so lazy and doesn't tend to things he needs to do, the long and short of it is that he loses pretty much everything his father had worked so hard for. Because he wants a quick out, eventually he gets the idea to go and dig up some legendary pirate treasure said to be buried close to his farm. An unfortunate accident while doing so leaves Lee in a sort of a trance; when he awakens, he looks down at\"...that eidolon, or representative, or duplicate of me, that was stretched on the grass\" and realizes that he's actually looking at his own corpse. Running off in an unsuccessful effort to find help, he returns to the scene and his body has vanished, with only a \"torn and bloody\" shoe remaining. As luck would have it, a certain Squire Higginson with whom Lee has had words, has also met his end, setting Lee to thinking:\"Why might I not, that is to say, my spirit, -- deprived by an unhappy accident of its natural dwelling, -- claim, and thus uniting interests together, as two feeble factions unite together in the political world, become a body possessing life, strength and usefulness?\"In short, Lee decides that it would be a good thing to \"inhabit\" Higginson's body -- and wishes it so. Soon he finds himself in the now-reanimated body of the Squire -- congratulating himself because now he is a \"respectable man, with my pockets full of money.\" But through a series of adventures, Higginson's body is just the first stop on Lee's soul/self/spirit journey (and I learned a new word to define this concept -- metempsychosis) -- and along the way he moves into various bodies whose owners all have one big thing in common: their lives are centered around money, each desiring to improve his own situation either through speculating, credit, expectations of good inheritances, or marrying into a better station. Lee lives quite a few different lives and in each one, makes a number of discoveries as he seeks out happiness. The novel is a satire and serves to skewer familiar types of the period: the dandy who plays a great game yet has not even a penny, a moneylender whose miserly qualities are very well known, an abolitionist philanthropist who spends his life trying to help the less fortunate and who does so ultimately at his own expense. What lesson does he ultimately learn? I leave that for the reader to discover.Robert Montgomery Bird was an anti-abolitionist, so when he comes to talk about slaves in the South, things get pretty intense. He had me laughing up until that point, but then his paternalistic attitude toward slavery sobered me up. Considering his stance on abolition, I get where he's coming from, but it is definitely not pretty. The rest of the book, however, is actually quite funny and Sheppard Lee is a character I'll definitely remember."}, {"userName": "Redeyedndogtired", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2631943-redeyedndogtired", "userReview": "Anderson Dean (fellow reader whom you all may take good advice from) recommended this title, which- much like Melville's \"big book\" shows that Modernity was invented long before the modern age- bends the mind and begs questions about what, exactly, an individual is.

Montgomery Bird does an excellent job of humorously painting a picture of how aristocratic, antebellum Philadelphia was. When people think of Philadelphia during and immediately after slavery, they automatically assume that it was such a great place. It had its moments, but Sheppard Lee takes you inside of the pompous, lazy and dangerous society that was aristocratic Philly."}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3465678-frank", "userReview": "Interesting if dated. Prefigures a favourite theme of American popular fiction and (especially) film: supernaturalism as morality tale. Pretty racist by modern standards in a couple of chapters concerning black slaves, which makes it difficult to really revive this as a classic central to the canon. And the writing itself isn't particularly compelling. So it's interesting to read as a product of its time rather than being a perennial classic masterpiece with universal appeal."}, {"userName": "Jenn F.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8245768-jenn-f", "userReview": "Robert Montgomery Bird is a forgotten contemporary of Melville, Poe, and Hawthorne.

It was pretty slow for the first part of the book, but right around page 50, things really get interesting. There is some great satire, and while I wish that Bird had been more abolitionist in his portions on slavery (His discussion of \"the happy slave\" can get nauseating sometimes). He walks an interesting line by exploring the issue of slavery without using abolitionist Sentimental writing or racist, pro-slavery literature. He finds an interesting way in this segment of the book to present both positions and leave the reader to decide for himself. When Sheppard Lee is dwelling in the bodies of others, he acquires much of their mannerisms and opinions without fully losing his initial identity. His identity is buried at times, and constantly in flux, but he seems to maintain both consciousnesses to some extent. I particularly liked Bird's sections on the Philanthropist, the mentally unhinged Southern gentleman, the miserly father, and the slave. Also, while the text claims to avoid philosophizing, there are some chapters that are Melvillesque in their musing."}, {"userName": "Bill FromPA", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6370216-bill-frompa", "userReview": "[I - Sheppard Lee.
