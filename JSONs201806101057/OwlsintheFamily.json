Around 34 or 35 years ago, I went into my elementary school library and talked to Mrs. Dogleash (surely Mrs. Dalgliesh, like the famous Liverpool footballer and manager, but we always thought of her as Dogleash). I needed a book. She gave me Owls in the Family. I remember the orange-gold shag carpet of my bedroom where I sat and read in the evening. I remember a flashlight and my crocheted blanket -- the one that sent out sparks in the dark if I rubbed it against my hair -- as I read past my bedtime. I remember riding my bike up the hill, deeper into our community, to get my Mom smokes (back when Canadian neighbourhoods embedded their little strip malls rather than top loading them at the entrance to their communities). I remember what was left of the prairies if I rode my bike in the other direction, passing cattle and a little slough on some nameless ranch.And as I nostalgically reread Farley Mowat's Owls in the Family, I found myself remembering the entire story as though I had only read it last week. I would start a chapter and know exactly what Wol and Weeps -- the titular owls -- would be getting up to. I imagine at least part of this is because I can still contextualize it all, since I lived my own version, sans exotic pets, in my own Canadian childhood. Mowat's Saskatchewan was not all that different from my Alberta. And all of the things Billy (Mowat's youthful self) did, riding his bike through the prairies, drinking from open water sources (mine was the river near our house), getting himself in danger without infantilizing laws and regulations of hyper-protection, these were all things I had done myself, in my own way. So maybe the memory of Billy Mowat's adventures were, thus, burned more deeply in my synapses. I dunno why, but I had to explore the reasons for my memory a bit here. What I do know is that this book was as excellent today as it was when I read it all those years ago, and I hope my son, who's standing over my shoulder as I type this, will enjoy it as much as I have -- even if our oceanside existence and our socially driven infantilization mean that he will never have the connections with Owls in the Family that I had, I hope his imagination will find wonder in a book that is all about exploration of oneself in the bigger world all around. Maybe his owls can be the crabs of Red Bum Point."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/892691-katie", "userReview": "I remembered loving this book from when I was a kid! My sister's favorite animals were owls, so we were in awe of Farley's family who had two pet owls. After looking around for this book in the library, I finally ordered it off Amazon. It was so worth it! It was a quick read of 3 sittings and all three of my kids loved it and we all laughed and laughed. I've liked most of Farley Mowatt's books, but I've never read his most famous book: Never Cry Wolf. Someday I'll get to that."}, {"userName": "Beth Hollmann", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5315094-beth-hollmann", "userReview": "I read this book to my son, who is 8, for a book report he needed to do for school. I'd heard the book recommended often throughout my years of homeschooling, but never gotten around to actually reading it. I'm so glad I did! We both thoroughly enjoyed it. My son, in particular, enjoyed reading about boys who love the outdoors, like he does (although he has much less accessibility to wild space than they did). The book tells how Billy, the main character, and his friends Bruce and Murray, come across a great horned owlet that's been orphaned by a storm, and they bring him home to Billy's house. Billy then raises him, and another owl they end up rescuing, and the book tells of their adventures together. My son and I laughed and laughed at the crazy things Wol, the first owl, would do. The boys and their antics were nearly as entertaining to me. It's a very short chapter book. It has 11 chapters, but only 89 pages, and enough pictures to grab my son's attention. The book was written about Mr. Mowat's real life experience, I believe, and we really enjoyed it. We learned a lot about the behavior of the owls, even though they were raised by humans. Of course, today, one does not simply bring home an owlet and raise it. My teen girls listened in often while we were reading, and they enjoyed the story as well. I'd recommend it for elementary kids who need a chapter book to read, boys who enjoy the outdoors and wildlife, and for anyone as a family read-aloud."}, {"userName": "Allison \u0f3bhikes the bookwoods\u0f3a", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3073428-allison-hikes-the-bookwoods", "userReview": "I struggled between three and four stars on this one. It's an interesting tale, but for the most part, it's one of those children's books where each chapter is a separate adventure, and that's generally not my cup of tea.

It's the true story of a boy who raises two owls and the various adventures they have together. It both reminded me of him, and reminded me how much he enjoyed animal stories. I love that this book is still on our library's Battle of the Books list. It is so not politically correct and I loved for that. I loved that the father claimed he was going to give his son a whopping, that they dressed the owls in doll clothes for a pet parade, that the father guns down as many crows as he can. See, so un-p.c. and yet so endearing to me. Yes, it is better that we no longer do those things (at least not in the suburbs) but I was kind of jealous for this guy's outdoor childhood. No TV, no video games, just him and his friends wandering through the woods and caves and rivers. OK. As a girl in the 50s, I would have likely been stuck at home not doing any of that, but still, it was a nice trip back in time . . ."}, {"userName": "Lilac Mohr", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57252697-lilac-mohr", "userReview": "This was such an entertaining family read-aloud.

The tales are perfect, and we would have thoroughly enjoyed this account of a boy in Saskatoon all on its own, as my two oldest already had, but the fact we are about to move to Saskatchewan made it all the more sweet.

This is one of Mowat's early books, written before \"Never Cry Wolf\" (the one he's most famous for.) It's more or less a juvenile, written from the point of view of a boy of somewhere between 10 and 13 and meant to appeal to boys that age. However, in the 21st century, I doubt that vision of boyhood would be at all recognizable to boys that age - even in rural areas, childhood isn't like that any more. So the book now is mostly only for adults old enough to remember, at least a little, when childhood meant running around loose all day, hiking into nowhere without supervision and with shotguns just for fun. Raptors weren't protected species, so a boy could go ahead and bring one or two owlets home from the wild to have as pets. Despite the datedness, if you read it in the context of when it was written, it's a sweet story, and the owls are great personalities, along with the kids."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27205041-kristi", "userReview": "Description: So. Supposing you lived in a town on the Canadian prairie. Then supposing you had a chance to take home a couple of orphaned great horned owls. Then, supposing said owls grew to full size, liked to nibble on people's ears, teased your dog, fought with skunks (yup! during dinner!), followed you to school, climbed trees... and couldn't fly. What a summer that would be! It's unpredictable. It's funny. And it's all true!Concerns: None.Summary: Maybe my personality has biased my outlook, but who wouldn't want pets like these? It's so much more interesting when the owl bites the mailman - or when it's an owl that follows you to school (and in the window!) - or when it's an owl that thinks he can walk on water! *Oh, and throw thirty-plus pet prairie dogs into the mix. I love it!* This is a fantastic true story of the life of a lucky kid and his everyday adventures after a couple of owls join his family.SEE MORE MIDDLE GRADE BOOK REVIEWS BY KRISTI AT:  kingdomofpages.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Alexis", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/689723-alexis", "userReview": "Re-read as a tribute to Farley Mowat on the day that he died. I loved this book as a child and it holds up surprisingly well. Mowat is a gifted and talented writer, and his work is both simple and descriptive. I also loved the references to Saskatoon- he refers to the railroad bridge and Spadina. I just learned that Farley Mowat had a column in the Saskatoon Star Phoenix when he was 13 years old.When I was small, I was convinced that this book was a true story. I only discovered last night that it's actually a novel. However, I think it's based on Mowat's adventures with his own pet owls- just because of the details and description. Apparently I'm not alone in thinking this was a true story, as many of the goodreads readers claim that the whole thing is true. :)"}, {"userName": "Chrisl", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11928354-chrisl", "userReview": "Mowat's Owl story is, in my memory, a quick read sequel to Mutt's story.
