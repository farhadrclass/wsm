Is it because we can relate?   Is it because we believe that if THEY can survive, maybe we can?   Is it because we are warped and like to see other people suffer with life?  Who knows!Annabelle is VERY dysfunctional. She has low self-esteem. She drinks too much, she loves too hard, and the monsters she battles in her real world don\u2019t compare to the demons she battles on the inside! Regardless, I love Annabelle.In Blood on the Bayou, Annabelle\u2019s love life takes a turn (for the worse or for the better is for you to find out), her magic abilities are further explored, and the characters around her (human and/or otherwise) create havoc in Annabelle\u2019s quest for peace and normalcy. We have not one, not two, but three central players, in Annabelle\u2019s messed up love life. Back for a return performance as boyfriend number 1 is Cane. In Blood on the Bayou, we find Annabelle exploring a possible future with Cane, only to unlock secrets about the man she thinks she loves which makes her doubt Cane\u2019s feelings and motivations behind the relationship.Boyfriend number 2 is Hitch. I know, you THINK he is not a boyfriend since Hitch supposedly has a pregnant fianc\u00e9e but in reality, Annabelle\u2019s feelings for Hitch are as strong as her feelings for Cane. Like Cane, Annabelle is discovering secrets in Hitch\u2019s closet that makes her doubt her own feelings for him AND whether she can trust him.And finally, we have Tucker. Tucker\u2019s past is as invisible as his body. Don\u2019t worry. The reader learns plenty about Tucker but the revelations create more questions than answers. By far, Tucker is my favorite character, he\u2019s playful, mysterious and for the life of me, I can\u2019t figure out his motives.OVERALLI hate love triangles. I really do. That is why I\u2019m shocked that I love this series. I think because Annabelle is so dysfunctional with a heart of gold, I can\u2019t help but be an Annabelle cheerleader, hoping she\u2019ll end up with the right guy, and live happily ever after. The problem is who is the right guy?Blood on the Bayou is not all about the love-Bermuda-triangle. It also has non-stop action, and a storyline that revolves not only around the faeries, but an entirely new species is introduced. You\u2019ll have to read it to find out!Thank you Shelley aka Gizmo's Reviews for allowing me to be a Guest Reviewer at your great blog!

Does an invisible man count as a man? If a penis you can't see falls in the forest is it really a penis at all? So everyone that knows me is all too familiar with my instant love with a fascinating new dark and gritty series about killer fairies called Dead on the Delta. Therefore when the opportunity presented itself to read and review the second installment called Blood on the Bayou I was elated with joy and devoured that book in one night it was so exhilarating. \u00a0\nI smile. Just a little. He's a mess, but I have a soft spot for messes.\u00a0I have to. My self image depends on it.\nWhat I love about Stacey Jay's writing skills is that she takes a heroine with issues and gives you the desire to \u00a0reach out your hand, befriend her and build her up. Poor Annabelle has coping issues, she lacks self esteem, has been abandoned by her family, abuses alcohol, desires the love of someone she can't have, and sometimes self destructive behavior is her middle name. All those vices and hangups in Annabelle's life I find endearing, and But don't let that fool you, in case that's not as endearing to you \u00a0she comes with many redeeming qualities as well. She kind, caring, feisty, witty, honorable, dependable, and philanthropic. \"I'm not going to sleep with you.\"\u00a0Maybe not tonight.\"\"Not any night. I'm swearing off men.\"\"Is this like the time you swore off booze?\" he asks with a grin. \"How long did that last? A day?\"\u00a0\"A day and a half,\" I grumble.  Blood on the Bayou begins three weeks after the events that occurred in Dead on the Delta. Annabelle takes us once again on a scary and dangerous adventure investigating an illegally established drug facility distributing Breeze. Fairy Poop or more commonly referred to as Breeze, is an unlawful mind altering substance used to get high and can ultimately lead to health issues as well as an untimely slow and debilitating death. Since Annabelle has recently acquired a telekinesis abilities as well as the ability\u00a0She comes equipped with three Achilles heels; Her on again off again bf Cane, Her ex bf Hitch and Tucker her Dirty Little Secret. And then he's kissing me, rough and wild and abandoned, like we're in a secret underground lab that could explode any minute and this might be the last kiss we ever share with anyone. Well the devastatingly gorgeous Hitch is back in all his self righteous glory. He's come back to Donaldsonville to investigate the illegal Breeze factory, and needs Annabelle's help to do so. Annabelle is the easiest to penetrate the facility since she is immune to the deadly fairy bite. He's left behind his pregnant fianc\u00e9 for work, and we discover that his relationship with Stephanie might not be a lovely bed of roses as Annabelle feared. \u00a0We finally get to see a vulnerable side of Hitch, and I'll admit it's glorious, and I melt when it shows up. He's just as tortured of a soul as poor Annabelle, yet he has just mastered the skills of hiding his emotions and fears, until he reveals his emotional side. It's obvious these two are hot mess together and\u00a0they just can't seem to fully move on from each other. This is one train wreck i cant help but watch.\u00a0\"Crazy.\" He says, as if he's been reading my mind, following my thoughts through the maze of pointlessness and gloom. \"You're crazy. You've always have been. And I'm tired of pretending I don't find crazy sexy as hell.\"Then there's Cane her delicious on again, off again boyfriend. He wants more, but clearly Annabelle isn't capable of having the relationship he desires with her. Poor pitiful Cane he's still suffering from the sad loss he suffered in Dead on the Delta, and hes ready to settle down, hes got a great police job, most females can't help but desire him, and yet the one he wants is so far away. We see a desperate side of him and it makes me wonder does he love Annabelle, or does love being in love?! Could she be easily replaced by another woman, if she were willing to be more domesticated than Annabelle.\"You're a distant cousin, my parents think you're trash, and I've never met you in my life, \" I say. \"You've got a shady past that I'm guessing involves some jail time and I'll be advising my friends not to walk alone with you after dark, or loan you money, or be that nice to you if they can help it.\"He laughs. \"Sounds perfect.\" I roll my eyes and push off down the street. \"Stay out of trouble Red.\"\u00a0 \"Suck it, Bubba,\" I call over my shoulder. Tucker is sexy, mysterious, and remains Annabelle's Dirty Little Secret. She still knows so little about him, but desires to know more of him nonetheless. Since her attack by killer fairies, she finds herself needing The Big Man's shots to keep her alive, and so she finds herself dependent on Tucker. Annabelle, has been honing her newly acquired telekinesis \u00a0skills and healing abilities she obtained in Dead on the Delta when she was bitten by killer fairies. What I loved about Tucker is that is his own way he's dependable, and it also helps that he has invisibility skills. Luckily we get a good dose of Tucker in Blood on the Bayou, because there's a lot more to him than the glimpse we get in Dead on The Delta.\u00a0\nI have no doubt she's using him. But maybe he's okay with that. Maybe he'll sleep with anything with boobs-even if they're fake and once nursed a child only a few years younger than he is--and I shouldn't have been even a little flattered that he tried to get into my panties yesterday.\nI absolutely loved every bit of this book!! It keep you guessing up until the very end. There's no denying that I love a tortured heroine or hero in my books, and Stacey Jay has delivered! If you enjoy dark, gritty Urban Fantasy with a heroine you can't help but cheer for, then the Annabelle Lee series will be your newest treasure.\u00a0 \"I'm Tucker, Master of Your Vagina.\"ARC provided by the publisherLike what you see here, check out my reviews at: http://MissVainsParanormalFantasy.com"}, {"userName": "Dija", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2857113-dija", "userReview": "[\u201cLife is disturbing.

He\u2019s a mess, but I have a soft spot for messes. I have to. My self-image depends upon it.Intelligent, witty, edgy, intriguing, articulate, crisp, eloquent, stylistic...the list can go on and on. You can see my fan girl squealing how much I respect this author.If you haven\u2019t read Stacey Jay\u2019s Dead on the Delta, RUN to the nearest bookstore and buy yourself a copy. If you have, then you need to immediately read her follow-up, Blood on the Bayou. You will not be disappointed. To say that I LOVE this series would be an understatement.Blood on the Bayou takes place soon after the events of Dead on the Delta. The man-eating fairies are still causing trouble, and Annabelle Lee is still reeling from the discoveries at the end of Delta. Annabelle is not your typical heroine. She\u2019s tough, yet vulnerable. Mouthy, yet insecure. Intelligent, yet untrusting. She is still drinking a little too much, but her sleeping pill and alcohol consumption has definitely decreased in this book. Her only sleep pill popping behavior is seen at the very beginning of this book. Annabelle is trying to be the person that she wants to be, and jumping those hurdles as she reaches them. This book takes Annabelle on a journey of self-realization and growth where she begins to learn her self-value.This book also explores loyalty and trust in-depth. Who should the characters really trust? Is there something going on behind the scenes? Can you even trust the ones that profess their love for you? Do your friends really have your best interest at heart?Stacey Jay has an incredible way with words. She writes quick, witty and intelligent dialogue for her characters. But maybe I\u2019d be okay right now if I\u2019d had a nice, calm sandwich before bed instead of a few beers and extra cheesy nachos, topped off with extra-strength Benadryl, in the hopes that Alcohol and Antihistamine would heroically join forces and fight back the evil duo of Jalapeno Sauce and Stupidity allowing me to snag a few hours of REM sleep.Tucker makes an appearance early on in this book. He is the sexy, charming, country boy we only got a glimpse of in the previous book. The banter between Annabelle and Tucker is fun and effortless. Annabelle is obviously attracted to Tucker, and he seems to be very interested in her. The following piece of banter is very tongue and cheek, but shows an example of Tucker and Annabelle in action.He smiles. \u201cI thought you gave up on the amateur detective stuff.\u201d\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d\u201cLibby almost killed you.\u201d\u201cAw.\u201d I purse my lips. \u201cYou sound like you care.\u201d\u201cWould have been a shame. You\u2019re a fine piece of ass.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re ridiculously good looking.\u201dHitch is a large part of this book, too. The plot revolves around Annabelle helping Hitch to infiltrate a scary drug facility. Why is Annabelle involved? Because she has the local connections, she\u2019s immune to fairy bites, and she can\u2019t refuse Hitch. Hitch evolves a lot in this book. He is obviously still attracted to Annabelle, and the tension between Annabelle and Hitch does not let up throughout this entire book. We find out, through an intense encounter with the Junkyard Kings, that Hitch is every bit as much of a mess as Annabelle. Hitch learns a secret Annabelle\u2019s been keeping from him and is devastated with the truth. He\u2019s not angry with Annabelle, but is disgusted with himself. \u201cAnd you loved me. Even the parts I hated. It felt\u2026too good.\u201d Hitch is openly questioning his relationship with his fiance, Stephanie, and is very conflicted over his resurgence of feelings for Annabelle. Hitch has made a lot of mistakes with Annabelle, but I truly believe that his life is more of a mess than Annabelle\u2019s by the middle of this book. He\u2019s losing trust in his job, his feelings for his fiance, and his place in his world.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the man I\u2019m becoming, and I can\u2019t be the man I was,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to be or believe anymore. But I know I love you.\u201dHitch makes some very bad decisions in this book, but I have a soft-spot for him. He\u2019s paying big time for those decisions. Cane is back in this book, too. He is still waiting on his Annabelle, but is suffering from what happened to his sister in the previous book. Cane, himself, is not sure whom to believe or trust as the plot develops. He also makes a big mistake regarding Annabelle.The Big Man is also present in this book. We learn more about this scary, powerful and invisible character. He seems to be in charge of a lot of things down in the Bayou. He is Annabelle\u2019s savior, as well as the person she most fears. The Big Man seems to think that Tucker and Annabelle should have some sort of relationship, and Tucker even admits that to Annabelle at one point. But my questions remain - who should Annabelle trust? Is everything as it appears? What other secrets are her friends and acquaintances keeping from her? Who is really in charge of the super secret Bayou drug facility? There are too many questions left at the end of this books for it to be the last in this series.Stacey Jay has created an intense, interesting and engaging world. She kept me guessing throughout the entire book. Just when I thought I had things figured out, she pulled the proverbial rug out from under me. I would urge all urban fantasy lovers to read this series. I think you\u2019ll fall in love with Annabelle and the cast of characters in this intriguing version of Louisiana. \nStacey Jay is a great talent and it would be a shame to lose Annabelle after only two books.\n I\u2019ll end this with another awesome quote from this book. I\u2019ve left out the involved characters\u2019 names to avoid spoiling this. I can\u2019t believe _______strapped explosives to _______\u2019s chest. What the hell does she think this is? Some 1980\u2019s spy movie? An episode of fucking MacGyver?"}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "*Rating* 4.0-4.5*Genre* Urban Fantasy*Review*Blood on the Bayou once again takes us into the world of Stacey Jay, and her heroine Annabelle Lee. It has been 3 weeks since the events of Dead on the Delta and Annabelle is as dysfunctional as they come still with her pill popping, and heavy drinking.It's been related that Annabelle and Stacia Kane\u2019s Chess Putnam could be best friends. In fact, it would be awesome to have a crossover short story featuring the two of them together solving the world\u2019s problems while holding off the men they seem to care about!Annabelle is still technically on probation from her job at the Fairy Containment & Control where she is a fairy popper scooper. She also has to get used to the fact that she has to rely on injections to keep her from going crazy after she was bitten by killer fairies. LeLe is immune to the Fairy bites which make her a valuable quantity when it comes to finding out what they are up to and locating the Breeze manufacturers.Since her attack by killer fairies, she finds that she needs The Big Man and his shots to keep her alive. Annabelle has been honing her newly acquired telekinesis skills and healing abilities she obtained in Dead on the Delta as well.She also has her hands full with 3 men who would make most women drool with envy.Hitch is back in town and once again looking for the person(s) responsible for killing his friend. Hitch, the FBI agent, and former lover of Annabelle, still portends to have feelings for her, and Annabelle herself isn't truly over him. Hitch finally understands that when Annabelle told him that something really awful happened to her at the hands of his brother, she meant it and he should have believed her. The problem with Hitch is that he is pretty much married to his partner and expecting a child with Stephanie who has more than a few secrets of her own.Cain still has feelings for Annabelle, but he wants to get married and have tons of little ones to make his family happy; especially his mother. Cain also has a few things he needs to get over like the fact that his sister was a breeze seller, and will most likely turn into a zombie one day soon. Tucker the invisible man is as mysterious and charming as they come. Of all the men that LeLe has feelings for; Tucker is by far the most interesting one as well as my personal favorite. He works for the Big Man, and could charm the pants of a toad at 50 paces. I can\u2019t help it. I adore Tucker and really hope that if and when there is a third novel in this book, that Tucker is LeLe\u2019s HEA.I love this series and would encourage those who follow me, or love awesome UF stories, as well as those who follow Stacia Kane, to pick up this book and read it. You will not be sorry you did.ARC provided by the publisher"}, {"userName": "April ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/605843-april", "userReview": "(Originally posted @ CSI:Librarian.)(Please Note: This review contains several spoilers relating to characters, but not to the overall plot.)While Blood on the Bayou had a really neat plot and some engaging minor characters, it really, really let me down in terms of its main character, Annabelle Lee.I am a very character-driven reader. Plots and world-building are awesome, but even then, unless I'm reading a book about the exciting adventures of a planet or plot-point, I need something else to go on. I need a character to connect to. That doesn't mean I have to become BFFs with the character. I'm not saying need to see their resume nor require them to adhere to a strict moral code, but I do prefer protagonists that have something --anything-- going for them. This is particularly true of Urban Fantasy where so many heroines are presented as absolute messes in terms of their personal life and emotional state.I can understand the appeal of a messy character. I can also appreciate fictional private investigator or magic user types who come across as both sarcastic and self-deprecating while masking some kind of secret hurt that gets slowly revealed over the course of their series. Having low self-esteem, being an addict of some kind, or having a dark past isn't going to keep me from liking a character. I think having issues like that can be compelling. Successful examples for me would be Stacia Kane's Chess, Putnam, Lauren Beukes' Zinzi December, Ilona Andrews' Kate Daniels, and Diana Rowland's Angel Crawford. They don't all have the same range of problems by any stretch of the imagination, but their books/series are all focused on the ways they change and become more comfortable in their roles as well as with themselves. Yes, men become a part of all of their lives, but that isn't the end all be all of their existence.In approaching Blood on the Bayou, I was aware that Annabelle was still quite a mess and not likely to make any improvements at a rapid pace because honestly she doesn't care enough about herself. Even knowing that, I figured something ultimately would change given that this is the second book in an on-going series. Therefore I was very disappointed when, just like in the first book, Annabelle didn't seem to care about herself on any level, constantly was looking for conflict to have with someone else, took very little responsibility for her actions, took advantage of various emotional attachments, and was apparently quite content cultivating a nice little garden of problems for herself.With a character like Annabelle, my hope is usually a) that she or he will either be such an awesome force that I won't care about their personal hang-ups or shortcomings, b) I will be given insight that will allow me to have more empathy for him or her, or c) he or she will decide to possibly change their life for the better in some small, organic way over the course of several books.Maybe this is expecting too much from a book or maybe it's expecting just the right amount from a novel. Jury's still out. Either way, character development would be sort of pivotal for a fictional someone with more issues than actual friends. The last thing I am interested in is how many guys or gals said heroine or hero can hook up with while ignoring their issues or so much as sorting out a single, solitary mess facing them outside of the main plot.So imagine my horror when Annabelle went from having maybe one guy to having three guys that were into her because... Well, that's the problem. I think I'm as likely to figure out the answer to that question as I am to figure out while every female character in Norway was in love with Jo Nesb\u00f8's Harry Hole.What was also problematic for me in terms of Annabelle and her love interests was that one of the guys into Annabelle has a pregnant fianc\u00e9e who was in a hospital and in danger of losing their baby. Until the plot got a move on, he spent a lot of time trying to get Annabelle to take him back because of their epic misunderstanding a long time ago. And he also thought her craziness is sexy. Another one of the guys was so in love with her that it is really depressing to read about. The right thing to do would have been to tell him it's over at some point, but instead Annabelle accidentally sort of intentionally strung him along for just about the entire book. And the third just was sort of there for most part but they have witty exchanges and he was hot and was also into her being a hot mess for no real reason.I realize these issues won't trouble every reader and to many it will seem like I read this book the wrong way. But I can only speak to my experience which was full of frustration, bafflement, and disappointment. I got really sick and tired of the plot having to get put on pause for Annabelle and her love square, which really didn't hold my interest or make me feel all that emotionally invested. More importantly, I didn't feel like the characters were all that genuinely invested or that they would have been pursuing Annabelle had she not been the main character. Along those lines, I also got really fed up by how nothing seemed to get resolved with any of the three men for far too long. And I really just found myself fundamentally disliking all the decisions Annabelle made and all the approaches she took to any given situation.Things got slightly better as the plot continued, and I did like the way the novel ended in terms of the plot as well as the minor characters especially Fern and Deedee. Along the way, there were a lot of quirky moments and the some of the humor worked for me. And, yes, Annabelle ultimately made some good decisions... but by then I felt like the only reason Annabelle was important to anyone in the book was because she was the main character and everything was from her point of view. The ways in which Annabelle seemed to be growing and changing didn't do much for me anymore than her love life did.In conclusion, not for me. I have no desire to only read and review books where the main character has a clean bill of mental health, but I'm not a fan of stories where female characters are messes in need of unconditional support and a good therapist but instead have 3+ guys trying to hook up with them.Related Review:Dead on the Delta by Stacey Jay"}, {"userName": "Katie Michaels", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4669344-katie-michaels", "userReview": "I am one of those people who judges a story based on how I feel when it's over. Yes, I value the journey, but if I'm not satisfied with the destination, the whole thing is damn near ruined. This book is a perfect example of a story destroyed by an unsatisfactory conclusion. I really enjoyed it. I was invested 100% in the characters and the outcome. And then the last chapter happened, prompting me to curse out loud and then stalk Twitter for someone to listen to me vent.I'll start at the beginning. The book picks up precisely where Dead on the Delta left off. Annabelle is on suspension from her job with the Fairy policing agency and she has agreed to help her ex-boyfriend Hutch solve the murder of an FBI agent. She is on a break from her relationship with Cane. And she is trying to get a grip on her new-found powers.As the story progresses, we learn that there is a lot more to Hutch's case than he first revealed. He has his own reasons for the investigation, but they're honorable. Working together, Hutch and Annabelle grow closer. Especially once he learns how badly he misjudged her when they first broke up. Just like in the first book, I found myself torn between Hutch and Cane. Annabelle clearly loves them both, but in different ways she can't even admit to herself. And they both love her. The complications are compounded by Hutch's pregnant fiancee and Cane's secrets and ultimatums. But regardless, I waited patiently to see where Annabelle's heart would eventually land her.In the meantime, the danger is growing and so are Anabelle's new gifts. Suddenly, she can communicate with the fairies and their message is deadly. Add that to the constant threat from the Big Man and Hutch's undercover mission, and I was on the edge of my seat. For the first 3/4's of the book, I didn't want to put it down.But things started to go awry toward the end. And I swear to you that someone else came along and wrote the last chapter, because: It. Makes. No. Sense. Annabelle makes bizarre choices. This quasi-epilogue thumbs its nose at everything we've been building towards. It doesn't make sense for Hutch, given what he learns during the climax. And it doesn't make sense for Annabelle, who can barely keep a cat alive, to take on a responsibility she has no business accepting. The answer to her love life... is insulting. Insulting to anyone who has given a damn throughout the course of the past two books. Not to mention, it makes our heroine look like a completely selfish horn-dog.I think I'd be less upset if I didn't enjoy the early parts so much. It had so far to fall and it crashed and burned spectacularly. I don't know how to rate it. The first half was a B+. The last chapter was an F.*ARC Provided by Pocket Books"}, {"userName": "Penny", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/679025-penny", "userReview": "In all honesty, this book deserves 1.5 stars. Barely. But I'm felling generous today so 2 stars it is. Where to start? It feels like Ms Jay wasn't even trying, like she didn't care about the characters and the series anymore. Almost like she phoned it in, drunk. There are so many typos it got my eye twitching right off. There's even a 'your're' where a 'your' should be, I kid you not. And our little MC, Anna-Belle Lee, is so inconsistent, so bi-polar, she's not even recognizable. One minute she loves this guy then she hates him then she loves two other guys and hates another. Then she's making out with the guy she really hates because he's so totally hot and she thinks he's the one she really likes, until five minutes later she doesn't. Then she knows she loves her not-quite-boyfriend and wants to commit to him always and forever. Until suddenly she doesn't and she's lusting after the guy she loathes, and wishing for her ex-boyfriend too. By the way, if you didn't notice there are three love interests in this book. Really. Don't even get me started on the fairy lore. It's a disaster. Which is odd because I felt as though I had a fairly decent grasp on all that when reading the last novel. And it's impossible to descern who the bad guy is because everything we're told is a lie. Everything. Even at the end of the book I have no idea why any of what happened had to happen. There was no point, seriously. When all was said and done I had nothing left to do but count all the gigantic plot holes. Lots more I want to say on this, and I may do so later, but I'm going to have to wrap this up since it's not so much fun typing this whole thing up while peddling away on a stationary bike. I don't recommend this book to anyone."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9481759-laura", "userReview": "In some ways I really liked this book but it also bothered me somewhat. I really like the setting and the whole unique spin on the fairies. I like the fact that the minority now makes up the majority of the population and vice versa. I liked finally getting a brief glimpse of the Big Man and getting a little bit more information about Tucker. I liked that Annabelle decided to take some initiative regarding Deedee.What I didn't like so much was that there were just too many love interests. I didn't think Hitch even needed to be in the story at all. His and Annabelle's relationship just needs to be over. That ship has sailed. They had six years during which they could have had a conversation about the truth of that horrible event from their past, but they didn't. Now Hitch has a pregnant fiancee. Anything between Annabelle and Hitch just feels like a shitty betrayal. There are enough characters in this series that any one of them could have asked for Annabelle's help with the cave and it wouldn't have changed the plot enough to matter. I also didn't like the fact that Stephanie's name was on one of the documents authorizing the experimentation on humans. It felt like a cheap shot taken in an attempt to let the reader off the hook for rooting for Hitch and Annabelle, if there were any who felt that way. I thought there was more than enough drama within the Cane, Tucker, Annabelle triangle anyway. I like Tucker just fine, nothing against him, but I felt like there was also a bit of a pro-Tucker anti-Cane vibe written into this particular installment. So many people were shoving Cane commitment in Annabelle's face and telling her she was undeserving of him that I had trouble not feeling smothered by it. I also felt like the interactions between Cane and Annabelle weren't nearly as entertaining as the ones between Annabelle and Tucker and it felt intentional somehow.The back and forth between foe to friend to foe practically gave me whiplash in regard to Marcy. I really would like to see another book in the series because I really would like to figure out what is up with her and also to find out what happened with Amity.I would probably rate this a little bit higher than three stars, if not for the fact that the editing process failed to catch the fact that Marcy's husband was referred to by the wrong name at the beginning of this book."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4250430-tracy", "userReview": "Bad Moon RisingLife in Donaldsonville, Louisiana may have settled down in the three weeks since Annabelle Lee discovered...so to speak...who had killed a child and left her body in the bayou, but that doesn't mean that Annabelle's life in any way resembles what it had been before the revelations, losses, and painful realizations bulldozed her body, heart, and mind during that investigation. Hey, at least she still has the booze. Thankfully, she still has the booze.Her relationship with Cane is still in limbo and she's got psychic abilities she barely understands. A brand-spankin' new Harley is stuck in her kitchen, stocked with the shots that will keep her from turning into a bunny-smashing psychopath. She's knows secrets about the sort of people who would whistle a jaunty tune while executing her in horrible and bloody ways if she ever reveals them. Oh yeah, and she's being randomly stalked by a tall, dark, and sinfully gorgeous man who she never sees coming...because most of the time he's invisible. Toss in a visit from her ex-boyfriend Hitch, who has come back to town to get her help investigating the death of a friend, and Annabelle's plate is more than full, it's overflowing and spilling angst, confusion, and tension all over the place.Helping Hitch is complicated. Being with Hitch is complicated. She still loves him. She doesn't want to, but she does. She also doesn't want him to die, and as she's the only Immune he knows in town, one of the rare five percent of the human population who is immune from the deadly bite of the mutated fairies in the bayou, helping him is something she feels compelled to do. She agrees to head back into the bayou and figure out the connection - if there is one - between smuggled goods, men who appear to have been kidnapped and tortured by government operatives, caves where mysterious goings on have been reported, and fairies who, despite all prior knowledge, can speak. Fairies who, despite her immunity, seem quite intent on killing her ugly.And Annabelle is going to realize that the past three weeks, when so much of her life got tilted upside down and flipped around and around, were positively Utopian compared to what's coming next. That is, if she survives what's coming next.~*~I liked Stacey Jay's introduction to the flawed and damaged Annabelle Lee in her series debut, Dead on the Delta. It was exactly the sort of dark, deadly urban fantasy that gets my Happy Reader lights flashing. Annabelle herself was a bit more full of self-loathing and apathy than I found completely appealing for a heroine, and the book was a bit more heavy on the emotional angst than I prefer, but I loved the nearly post-apocalyptic world that Jay created and the plot was spot-on awesome.Blood on the Bayou is better. In every way.Still horribly and wonderfully flawed but much less apathetic and self-destructive, Annabelle Lee has matured in this installment. She was far more sympathetic to me as she struggles with a case that may end up ripping away from her everything she thought still true at the end of the last book. Life is definitely not full of fluffy puppies and dewy daffodils in Donaldsonville, and the Bayou is as deadly as it is beautiful, but Annabelle seems to attract the sort of horrific trauma that could keep a cadre of therapists in Jaguars and BMWs for a decade. Man, that makes for some deeply disturbing and fabulously entertaining reading!I have to admit, I was Team Hitch in the first book. I've never quite warmed up to Cane, though he seems like a nice enough guy. That's the problem, actually. Annabelle was in such a wretchedly unhappy place in her life in the first book that frankly, I thought Cane was far too good for her and didn't deserve the drama that cloaks Annabelle like a death shroud. Hitch, on the other hand, has always been screwed up, though he hides it, and I felt for the pain of Annabelle's unresolved first love. Not to mention, after the shit Hitch pulled when they split up all those years ago, I felt he deserved the healthy helping of angst that would come from being with Annabelle. Twisted of me, but true.Then I read this book and went from Team Hitch to Team Burn-Hitch-In-Effigy in six point two chapters (or less). I was thrilled that the one major unresolved issue between the two of them was finally addressed, though, and the scene in which it was dealt with was perfectly dripping with pathos. That being said, had I been Hitch's right hand fairy-repellent in this book, I would have shot him myself and washed my hands of him. Weak, desperate, wishy-washy, Hitch is an emotional quagmire that Annabelle doesn't deserve to suffer. I had moments where I actually hated him and would have heartily enjoyed his painful, screaming death.As for Tucker...well...he's my favorite secondary character in this series so far. For more reasons than the potential horizontal action he could have with Annabelle, too. I love the mystery surrounding his past, his personality, and his motives and loyalties. I love his irreverent front and the depth of his awareness of Annabelle. The chemistry between them - not just sexual, but character-wise - is fantastic. And he steals every scene he's in. I want more and more and more of him.There was a lot going on in this book. Jay certainly doesn't skimp on plot points and story layers. I found the fairy stuff and the ramifications of Annabelle's mysterious transformation more engaging and compelling than Hitch's investigation, but the threads were woven together with a cohesion that balanced out the personal/relationship threads and held my interest throughout.There were a couple of weird things though. Maybe I missed something, but Hitch's FBI partner and significant other Stephanie - thankfully not actually present in this book, because I liked her in the previous book about as much as I like scooping cat poop - is referred to as Hitch's fiance in the last book and in the beginning of this one. Then later she's referred to as his wife by both Hitch and Annabelle. More than once. It wasn't clear to me if there was a reason for that. I was reading an ARC, though, so maybe that isn't in the final product.Then there's the final chapter of the book. I can't understate how very much I disliked it, and it's the sole reason I'm giving this book four stars instead of five. After the pulse-pounding action, drama, danger, terror, and angst of all twenty-nine preceding chapters, chapters that forced me to bleed with Annabelle, mourn and cry and rage with her as she did, sweat and scream and fight beside her, I was suddenly and ruthlessly shoved six weeks into the future and had almost every major plot point and story element summed up or capped off in Annabelle's thoughts preceding an event that itself popped up out of nowhere considering where the lives of the involved parties were in the last spot they were mentioned.I was more than a little gobsmacked by it all, to tell you the truth. Not only do I find that sort of summary resolution d\u00e9nouement to be a horrible plot device that cheats readers out of the emotional triumphs and tragedies that would have evolved from several of those points being written out in real time, but in this case in particular, several of the items wrapped up in the fewest words possible didn't even make sense. One major plot point was glossed over as if it had no consequence at all. I felt like I was being force-fed a Happy for Now ending that diminished the excellent storytelling leading up to it.Up to that point, this was a fantastic book on every level, one that delighted even as it tormented and traumatized. There's so many things I like about Annabelle. She's so wonderfully flawed and yet, in this book, she's trying in a way that I felt was missing in the first book. I'm dying to find out how the revelations and developments in this one serve to enhance and evolve her character as her journey continues. Plus, more Tucker. I definitely need more Tucker. There just ain't no bad to be had there.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."}, {"userName": "Rhianna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2000093-rhianna", "userReview": "The Fearless Series Every UF Fan Should ReadBeing immune to Fairy venom should be awesome, but for Annabelle Lee it's really been a curse. Once again called to duty helping investigate a murder she winds up once more tangled in between the man she once loved and the one she's still trying to figure out. But Annabelle can barely take care of herself, or keep Gimpy, the cat she's unwittingly adopted, from getting into all sorts of dietary disasters let alone settle down. With her new-found powers and the mysterious Invisibles who've marked her as their own she's ass deep in alligators with no one to trust as she finds out they are the only ones hiding things.Trying so hard not to give anything away with my sum-up there, sorry guys, this book was just too good to reveal more than the official blurb. I know there are a lot of readers who didn't like the first book because they found Annabelle's alcoholism and irresponsibility off-putting. But that is what makes her truly a character to love and root for in my opinion. She's just as flawed as ever this time around but now she's trying to do something about it. I rarely connect so personally to a character that I want to smack them upside the head like they're family and somehow Annabelle continues to be that pain-in-the-neck cousin (who doesn't have one of those?) I want to yell at. Of course, I mean that in the most good way possible because she gets me emotionally invested in her story!And what a story it is! The plot gets so thick it's swamp water this time around. There's a whole lot more to what we learned about the fairy mutations that gets revealed and with it there's a lot to look forward to when the next installment comes out. The demi-love-triangle\u2014I can't quite call it a true love triangle with the circumstances\u2014gets a little more complicated with Tucker adding to the hottie-pool. I definitely wanted more Tucker and Jay delivers but good. If only we could all be as blessed as Annabelle and have three sexy dudes like Hitch, Cane, and Tucker vying for our affection! The only part of the book I didn't like was that it had to end. The pace is fast, I usually struggle with books over the 350 page mark and BLOOD ON THE BAYOU managed to fly by for me. I really hope to see more from this series because it's strangely under-noticed considering how original it is. If you enjoyed Rachel Vincent's Shifters series, enjoy Stacia Kane's Downside Ghosts, or like Mercy Thompson this is on the same level and in my humble opinion a MUST-READ for anyone calling themselves an urban fantasy fan. This series has the gritty realism laced with dark humor that makes this my favorite genre and one of my favorite series, hands down."}, {"userName": "mrsj", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3579525-mrsj", "userReview": "Well, I tried.But I can't.

This one wasn't as dark as the first one in some ways. People who had issues with Annabelle and her imperfections (i.e. drunkenness) might be more comfortable with her this time around because she is trying to clean up her act a bit. But I like this imperfect woman and her struggles are a big part of what make the series interesting and different for me and I hope she doesn't become too idealized too quickly. Her struggles and imperfections are what I related to in the first book.\u00a0Annabelle has had a lot to deal with.\u00a0First, there is the basic premise of this world, it's a really stressful and frightening place to live in in many way, a sort of apocalyptic meets urban fantasy setting. A lot of people who live in the fairy-infested area where Annabelle lives have become addicted to sleeping pills because they have anxiety issues and nightmares - who wouldn't? And then there's her history. She's insecure, she drinks too much (less in this book), she too needs sleeping pills to deal with her crazy life (who doesn't?), oh, and did I mention that she's insecure? She's also dealing with having been rejected by her family, not trusted and dumped by the man she loved after his brother raped her, and probably has some depressive or anxiety issues (my diagnosis, just a guess). She's kind of a mess. But she's also smart as a whip (a former med student), brave, loving, generous and funny, loves good food (hot wings!), and generally the kind of gal that I'd like to be pals with.\u00a0As for this book specifically, in an attempt to be spoiler free, I'll just say that it was a study in betrayal and secrets. By the middle of the book it at least appeared that everyone that Annabelle ever cared about, except Deedee, had betrayed her. She felt completely isolated and alone. Her lovers, the people she'd come to think of as family, and even her bosses, had secrets that hurt her feelings and some of which threatened her life. There was a lot going on in this book but I really liked the way it all wove together. Now that I'm thinking about it, I never once rolled my eyes and thought that it was too much coincidence, or that certain people shouldn't have had any reason to know each other, none of the things that irritate me sometimes on other books. There was one person who did have a big secret that was revealed that could have been an eye-roller but it was built up to enough that it fine.\u00a0I really liked the layers that were revealed about the fairies in this book. I wondered in the first book about the the author's use of the word fairy for the creatures since they seemed to be just mindless insect-like animals at first. But I really enjoyed everything that was revealed about them in this book. And Grandpa Slake was just so creepy. I was intrigued by the hints of information about the Gentry and I'm looking forward to seeing how that plays out more in the next book.\u00a0It wasn't a perfect book.\u00a0I was kind of surprised at some of the choices the author made when it came to the romances. I'm not sure Annabelle came off as positively as she could have. (Not that the guys looked so good either, let me tell you!) And I'm not quite sure about the overall change in Annabelle's character. Not that she isn't still screwed up, she's still making mistakes and drinking a bit too much, but she felt a bit too suddenly heroic, and yet judgmental of the guys' mistakes at the same time, it just felt odd sometimes. But I'm chalking it up to second book growing pains. Overall I like this world and this character and the author's writing very much and I'm looking forward to book three."}, {"userName": "Ferdy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4596358-ferdy", "userReview": "3.5 starsAnnabelle Lee is one of the 5% immune to the venom that comes with a fairy bite. Annabelle works for the FCC (Fairy Containtment and Control) collecting fairy samples in the bayou. After being suspended by the FCC, Annabelle agrees to help her FBI ex-boyfriend, Hitch with finding and shutting down an undercover drug operation in the bayou. Annabelle not only has to deal with the unresolved feelings for her ex but also her new powers and the cannabalistic fairies who are hellbent on killing Annabelle. The drug storyline didn't really hold my interest. However, I did like finding out more information about the Big Man, Tucker and most of all the little bit of history on the fairies.Annabelle reminds me of Chess from Stacia Kane's Downside series, only I find Chess far more likeable. Annabelle is a mess, she's had a lot to deal with in her life but I found it hard to sympathize with her this time around because for most of the book she just acts so hard done by. Annabelle has a lot of good things in her life - a home, friends, money, a job and a devoted boyfriend, yet she still moans about everything. At least with Chess, she tries her hardest to be happy, even though she messes it up..Chess TRIES and WANTS happiness whereas Annabelle just wallows in her problems. I also like that Chess in spite of everything made something of herself as a churchwitch, unlike Annabelle who hasn't put any effort whatsoever in her job or anything else. Even though she has her faults, I still have a soft spot for Annabelle, it was great to see that by the end of the book she somewhat pulled herself together, took control and started to make some significant changes in her life. Annabelle's love life is ridiculous..she has 3 love interests and for some odd reason they're all crazy about her. I could just about believe 2 guys wanting her, but 3 guys was hard to buy..there was nothing all that special about her to warrant the affections of 3 eligible men. I really liked Cane and Tucker, they were there for Annabelle and didn't judge her, but I did think that she took them both for granted. Hitch is the other love interest, I absolutely hated him - he cheats on his pregnant fiancee who's in hospital and then acts morally superior to everyone else.. ugh. I don't know what Annabelle sees in him, she risks her life on several occassions for him and his pregnant fiancee but he leaves her to die at least twice. If there is another book, I really hope that Hitch only has a small role, his prescence just irritated me.I hope there will be another book - I'd like to see how Annabelle handles her new responsibilities and I want to know more about Marcy and the Big Man, the fairies and Annabelle's parents."}, {"userName": "Christal", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1180557-christal", "userReview": "[I didn't like the ending where it was insinuated that she was cheating on Cane with Tucker though.

The worldbuilding is fantastic and the supporting characters are nearly as wonderful as Annabelle. My only real complaint about this series is that the books seem to be a tad overlong. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but with this book and the first one I found myself wanting to skim so I could get closer to the action, but I didn\u2019t and perhaps that is why I feel like I completely get Annabelle and her dysfunction, which is definitely starting to lessen as she becomes more confident in herself.In Blood on the Bayou we explore Annabelle\u2019s powers more while she tries to help Hitch with a super secret government mission that isn\u2019t sanctioned by the government. I have to say up front that I don\u2019t mind love triangles or a character going back and forth over who they should be with as long as the options are all viable options. I never felt the chemistry between Annabelle and Cain in Dead on the Delta so I was all Hitch all the way despite all the baggage he carried with him. But in this book both men are blown out of the water by her chemistry with Tucker and I hope that a relationship with him is explored further in the next book. He might have some serious issues (like his boss), but after everything that goes down in Blood on the Bayou, I think that Tucker is the healthiest choice for Annabelle.Back to the plot of the book that isn\u2019t related to her love life, we see a lot of familiar faces and learn some deep dark secrets, some good, some bad. There are some devastatingly heartbreaking moments for Annabelle that has nothing to do with the men in her life. I felt horrible for her, but loved the way that she rose from those moments and took charge of her life in a positive way instead of drowning her sorrows in alcohol like she would have in Dead on the Delta. As much as I love dysfunctional characters, I also love to see growth in those characters. I love to see them overcome what has held them down so long. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if that growth continues in the next book, which I will definitely be reading."}, {"userName": "Cat Russell  (Addicted2Heroines)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4250664-cat-russell-addicted2heroines", "userReview": "Dark, gritty urban fantasy doesn't get much better than this.After discovering my newest obsession with the series debut, Dead on the Delta, I had very high expectations for Blood on the Bayou and not for one second did Jay disappoint. Within the first few pages, I was hooked.It was full of dark, sometimes twisted, humor and I can't recall laughing quite this much during Dead on the Delta.My favorite characters continued to play significant roles and characters who were briefly mentioned are explored more in depth this time around. What added to the excitement of this story is that you're on the edge of your seat wondering who is trustworthy, who is a traitor, and constantly switching sides.Annabelle agrees to help her ex, Hitch, uncover a mystery surrounding a murder and secret chemical-weapons lab. And in addition to these new complications, the circumstances with the fairies begin to change and create a whole new, and terrifying, set of problems. Annabelle certainly has her hands full. She makes new discoveries about her unique abilities and small personal improvements that feel believable and realistic. I wouldn't be satisfied if her changes were too rapid or drastic.

I can't wait until the next one."}, {"userName": "Jamie ~ Bad Boy Inspector", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1950211-jamie-bad-boy-inspector", "userReview": "4.75/5 I could not put this book down. Every time I tried I would get to a spot that just demanded my attention..lol I think this series just keeps getting better and better and I can't wait to find out what is going to happen next!! As far as the love triangle goes Hitch had my heart from the start but Tucker just came in and stole it from him in this book so I am curious to see how that plays out."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4832945-lauren", "userReview": "Officially done with this series. It is silly but it has an interesting idea. Unfortunately it also has a love triangle that is now a love square. This leads to much angsting over pretty boys (which all love our druggy, commitment-phobic MC) while in the midst of real danger. Blech. DONE."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2837087-debbie", "userReview": "This was one of my favorite new series last year and I loved this follow up..can't wait for the next installment."}, {"userName": "Piseog", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10226094-piseog", "userReview": "Another great book in the Annabelle Lee series. It was exciting and Annabelle is great and it has so much potential to be a top UF series. The only thing that annoyed me was the author's approach to the romance aspect. We now have three suitors for Annabelle and I'm not sure who we are supposed to root for. I always hated Hitch, and I loved Cane in book 1, but now the author seems to not care about Cane anymore and introduced Tucker as the main love interest. I feel bad for Cane, but at the same time I actually love Tucker. I'm so mad the author skipped over his and Annabelle's time together in the end. That would have been great to read. So if Tucker was the only choice it would be perfect, but it's not fair to also have Cane muddling everything up. The way things were left with Tucker and Annabelle just makes me want to read more. Unfortunately it was only after I finished book 1 that I discovered this is an unfinished series. There are no more books after this one, even though there is still to much to learn about. I hate it when that happens!! I sent a message to the author asking about a book 3 but she never got back to me. It's such a pity. I'd love to read another book in this series but I don't think we'll ever get it. I suggest not bothering with this series if you hate unfinished endings."}, {"userName": "(Tori-Smexybooks) smexys_sidekick", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3094317-tori-smexybooks-smexys-sidekick", "userReview": "Originally posted at http://smexybooks.com/2012/05/review-...Fairy Containment and Control agent Annabelle Lee is back and has more trouble than ever. Her current boyfriend, Cade, has put their relationship on hold after catching her with her exboyfriend Hitch. Her gifts seem to be having some bad side effects that are only alleviated with a special drug. A drug that places her squarely in bed with the Big Man. Tucker, the Big Man\u2019s gorgeous enforcer, can\u2019t seem to make up his mind if he wants to kill Annabelle or sleep with her. When Hitch asks for Annabelle\u2019s help in solving a murder mystery, she finds herself suddenly questioning everyone and everything she knows.I love the unique premise of blood thirsty fae whose bite can kill over 95% of the population. Set in the steamy bayous of Louisiana, we are taken down a long treacherous path filled with murderous fae, unsettled ghosts, and government conspiracies. Annabelle Lee is an agent with Fairy Containment and Control. Basically she picks up samples of Fae droppings for study. Placed on suspension for her actions in the investigation into the murder of Grace Bauchamp, Annabelle has a lot of time on her hands. The events of the past three weeks have her rethinking the path her life is taking. Irresponsibility is Annabelle\u2019s crutch she uses to support her drinking and drug use. She is trying to cut back but her relationship problems only seem to intensify the need to drown herself into obliteration. When Hitch contacts Annabelle about a murdered co worker and a secret government lab, Annabelle agrees to help and finds herself knee deep in a long reaching conspiracy. Who or what has authorized this lab and why? All the while, Annabelle\u2019s gifts are expanding which leaves her in a quandary. The Fae are talking to her\u2026and she can understand them. She needs to talk to someone about this but the BIg Man has made it perfectly clear-talk and you die.Often you will come across a book with an appealing, addictive storyline, but whose characters leave you angry. That is how this series is for me. Action packed and filled with more twists and turns than a labyrinth, Blood On The Bayou continues its dark worldbuilding as it divulges deeper into the events surrounding the mutation that turned the normally gentle Fae into human hating predators. We see friends become enemies and enemies become friends. Relationships are tested and revelations are made that open new paths for this series to take. Dark humor engages the reader as we try to understand the mess that is Annabelle and her life.There are three men in Annabelle\u2019s life who all want something from her. Cade, her boyfriend, wants to settle down and have a family with her. Hitch, her ex boyfriend, wants what they had before a terrible event doomed their relationship;, even though he is engaged and expecting a baby with another woman. Tucker, the invisible man who supplies her with her much needed shots, wants to see where their attraction leads to. This is the part I find distasteful. Dysfunctional heroines aren\u2019t a turnoff for me. Life can bomb you from all sides and it often leaves you bloody and broken on the side of the road. If a hero or heroine can rise above the turmoil that is their lives and make a concentrated effort to change then I am 100% invested in their life. While Annabelle is certainly trying to clean up her life, I find her actions in the area of her personal life distasteful. She seems to have no morals at all. Or, rather she has them, which we see from her internal thoughts, but she easily brushes them aside in a way that Scarlett O\u2019 Hara would have been proud of. She has three men all wanting her yet for her it\u2019s \u201ccomplicated\u201d and she uses that as an excuse to emotionally and physically cheat on them all. What I found over the top is she gets angry and feels betrayed when they may or may not be doing the same thing. Which of course she then uses to justify to herself and us why her cheating and lies are excusable. I didn\u2019t really see much character development from any of them. Cade stays in the background as usual. Hitch still teeters between fianc\u00e9e and Annabelle and Ms. Jay uses a predictable subplot resolution that absolves them of any guilt for messing around. Tucker\u2019s feelings are new and not much reasoning is offered to WHY he is suddenly looking for HEA with Annabelle but my feeling is that it\u2019s not all for the sake of true love.Another subplot that threw me off was Deedee, an orphan who adores Annabelle. I don\u2019t want to give anything away but lets just say that Annabelle can\u2019t seem to take care of her cat, why would anyone think she could care for a kid? Throughout the book Ms. Jay keeps trying to make Annabelle grow up and accept responsibility in ways that felt forced. We also get to see more of her best friend Fern whose attitude and actions would have had me bitch slapping him all the way to Alabama. Best friends are allowed more leeway than regular friends but when they become a self righteous prig, it\u2019s time to cut them loose.The main conflict is a convoluted mystery that requires careful attention. Dangerous pitfalls litter the way as we follow the clues. Ms Jay carefully exposes key players in dramatic fashion that left me confused in respect to some revelations revealed. The plot wraps itself up fast and furious in an acceptable fashion though leaves much open in preparation for book three. While I could have overcome, or at least overlooked, my objections to Annabelle\u2019s behavior in certain areas in order to continue with the arc, the epilogue crushed that. What happens in there pretty much solidifies my dislike of Annabelle.While I\u2019m sure this series will continue to appeal to those who love an action packed dark Urban Fantasy, I\u2019m afraid that Annabelle Lee and I will be parting ways here.Overall Rating: D"}], "description": "The second book in a new urban fantasy series featuring mosquito-sized fairies with poisonous bites that drive humans insane.It's only been three weeks since Annabelle helped solve the murder of Grace Beauchamp, and in the process, she discovered a secret world of invisible, magic-working people who have decided she might have what it takes to join their ranks. As best as she can determine, Annabelle\u2019s attack by a group of fairies has infected her with paranormal ability she did not previously possess, including being able to mentally move objects and heal wounds. Her new abilities appear to have few negative side effects, aside from creepy dreams. But would that change if she stopped injecting herself with the mystery drug delivered to her by the even more mysterious Tucker, one of the Invisibles? Leery of trusting criminals with her health, Annabelle wishes she had someone she could talk to about the changes in her life. Enter Hitch, FBI agent and Annabelle's ex, who's back in Donaldsonville on an off-the-books investigation. Hitch suspects that there's a government-funded illegal lab that\u2019s developing a controversial fairy-killing spray that could adversely affect the existence of every living thing in the delta\u2014including humans. And Hitch and Annabelle will have to find a way to work together if they're going to find a way to shut it down.", "title": "Blood on the Bayou\n      \n          (Annabelle Lee #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11541470-blood-on-the-bayou", "average": 3.95, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1316228650l/11541470.jpg", "reviews": 126, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1691206.Stacey_Jay", "name": "Stacey Jay"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fairies", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11541470-blood-on-the-bayou", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16113606-of-beast-and-beauty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9972882-juliet-immortal", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18782855-princess-of-thorns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3965854-you-are-so-undead-to-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9467196-dead-on-the-delta", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
