I was reminded of Caves a couple of months ago when I read Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride, which is in many ways an updated version of the Jezebel story from I Kings. Atwood gives Jezebel a rough ride. Here's what Asimov has to say:The Jezebel of the Bible was a faithful wife and a good one according to her lights. She had no lovers that we know of. After Jezebel's husband, King Ahab, died, her son, Jehoram, became king. One of the captains of his army, Jehu, rebelled against him and assassinated him. Jehu then rode to Jezreel where the old queen-mother, Jezebel, was residing. Jezebel heard of his coming and knew that he could only mean to kill him. In her pride and courage, she painted her face and dressed herself in her best clothes so that she could meet him as a haughty and defiant queen. He had her thrown from the window of her palace and killed, but she made a good end, according to my lights.I'd forgotten how passionate he was about defending her. One of the many unexpected things about Asimov was that he was quite a feminist, but somehow without ever acquiring that label. The Susan Calvin stories are an even clearer example."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "The Caves of Steel (Robot #1), Isaac AsimovThe Caves of Steel is a novel by American writer Isaac Asimov. It is essentially a detective story, and illustrates an idea Asimov advocated, that science fiction can be applied to any literary genre, rather than just a limited genre. In this novel, Isaac Asimov introduces Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, later his favorite protagonists. They live roughly three millennia in Earth's future, a time when hyperspace travel has been discovered, and a few worlds relatively close to Earth have been colonized\u2014fifty planets known as the \"Spacer worlds\". The Spacer worlds are rich, have low population density (average population of one hundred million each), and use robot labor heavily. Meanwhile, Earth is overpopulated (with a total population of eight billion, and strict rules against robots have been passed. The \"caves of steel\" are vast city complexes covered by huge metal domes, capable of supporting tens of millions. In The Caves of Steel and its sequels (the first of which is The Naked Sun), Asimov paints a grim situation of an Earth dealing with an extremely large population, and of luxury-seeking Spacers who limit birth to permit great wealth and privacy. Asimov, who described himself as a claustrophile, mentioned that a reader asked him how he could have imagined such an existence with no sunlight, and related that it had not struck him until then that living perpetually indoors might be construed as unpleasant. ...\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0645\u0627\u0647

He also describes over population and stringent measures to survive, rater than more obvious and successful methods utilized by the Spacers.Gary: Asimov had clearly read the Bible, he had several informed sections about the Jezebel story.

Just re-read this after having first read it many years ago. Asimov was a superb story-teller and his books are almost always fun, easy to read and full of big ideas. This one is no exception. Set on Earth many millennia before the time when the The Foundation Trilogy takes place, it is a time when humans have been divided into two main groups, the Earthmen and the Spacers. The first are those 8 Billion souls on Earth living in massively croweded \"mega cities\" (the Caves of Steel) where food and other goods are rationed due to limited supply. In order to allow necessary production efficiencies, Robots are used but are alomost universally hated by Earthmen as they are seen as taking away jobs from real people. The second group, the Spacers, are the decendants of \"Earth\" first colonists who years before left the Earth to colonize the 50 \"Outerworlds.\" In contrast to the Earth, the Outerworlds have very low populations and live a life of luxury, in part do their embrace of Robots as useful tools to help make life easier. They are also incredibly long-lived due to their scientific advancements. There is a lot of animosity and hate between the two groups which is pivotal part of the story. The story itself is a murder mystery involving a murdered Spacer. An Earth cop, Elijah Bailey, is partnered with a Spacer Robot (the soon to be famous R. Daneel Olivaw) to solve the crime. The real charm of the story is the description of life on Earth, the contrast between that life and that of the Spacers and the Earthmen and the explorations of the various prejudices among the groups. An excellent read and a great introduction to the Robot novels of Asimov.

Because it rang not a bell at all.Except that I knew within the first 30 pages who the murderer was. So either I had read it and blocked out everything but that, or Asimov didn't construct his mystery particularly well in this case. I think it's the latter. It's a matter of a few extraneous details at a moment that felt far too obviously one chosen to weave in details that would be important later.

This is essentially a detective story set in a future world of megacities, space exploration, and human/robot interaction. The chief tension in this future society is that of overpopulation. There are too many people and their numbers are constantly growing; soon they will pass the point of sustainability on Earth. The book explores a couple of possible solutions to this problem. One is a return to the soil, a simplification of society and return to \"medieval\" ways of life. The other is further space colonization, sending humans out with robots to live together on new worlds. Asimov's attention to the tensions between humans and robots is interesting because it raises questions about what makes us truly human and separates us from machines. It also mirrors broader concerns about Otherness in the form of minorities, immigrants, and divisions of social class. Humans are suspicious of robots and harbor resentment toward them for putting them out of jobs and this resentment is treated fairly sympathetically throughout the novel, even as one of the central characters, R. Daneel Olivaw, a robot, is also treated sympathetically. Asimov presents a solution that is remarkably progressive, arguing for a future in which humans and robots can live and work together. He calls it C/Fe: \"Carbon is the basis of human life and iron of robot life. It becomes easy to speak of C/Fe when you wish express a culture that combines the best of the two on an equal but parallel basis\" (48). \"Equal but parallel\" sounds almost like the \"separate but equal\" racial policy of the early and mid-20th century, but Daneel's further explanation distinguishes between the two. He says, \"[C/Fe] symbolizes neither one nor the other, but a mixture of the two, without priority\" (48). Whether read in terms of a human/machine future or in terms of contemporary politics and Otherness, this is a promising and hopeful vision of future cooperation.In general, this is an interesting and entertaining novel, which, although it does fall prey to some stereotypical devices of detective fiction (e.g., explaining everything away in the last few pages in long speeches), its only real weakness to my mind is Asimov's overreliance on one particular exclamation. I swear, Lije Bailey, the protagonist, says \"Jehoshaphat!\" a hundred times throughout the book if he says it once. In real life, people may have habitual exclamations, things they say a lot, and this might pass without too much notice, but in writing, even a few repetitions of a particular phrase starts to feel like overuse, which means that many usages begins to feel like the offending character has some sort of disorder."}, {"userName": "Penny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10165256-penny", "userReview": "[ I also thought that Jezebel's reaction to her husbands interpretation of the story of Jezebel in the Bible was very strong.

But I think it's fair to say that Asimov is at least as much interested in building his world as he is in the mystery itself. It's a good thing, because the mystery isn't entirely satisfactory.The world he builds, on the other hand... Now that's interesting. Earth's population has been sequestered in cities and subjected to strict rationing. Intelligent and vaguely human-like robots are everywhere, and despised by most Earthmen. It's a pretty solidly built world, and I was far more interested in reading more about the civism system that Earth's cities use. Aside from overuse of \"Jehoshaphat\" by Bailey (which did get grating by the end, especially in an audiobook), the narration here was great. Bailey was a nearly perfect viewpoint character to use in this story. I'm excited to keep reading the Robots series, and onwards.

It is my opinion that Asimov is frightfully overrated, even compared with other authors who were his contemporaries, and therefore lived in, and wrote from, the same social climate.Nearly all of the human characters were frustratingly stupid throughout most of the book. The one woman in the book was basically just in the story to be hysterical, gullible, and even nonsensical.The protagonist, though he is allegedly a competent professional detective, acts like he's never dealt with actual people before, and the entire police department is startled into overly emotional reactions when they discover there has been a murder. In a world with 8 billion people, the police department in a city populated by 20 million people is startled by a murder? I think not.Asimov, while he makes decent and interesting predictions about how things like robots will affect society, does not seem to understand people at all. This is not the first book of his I have read where all the characters seem like hollow plot shells, whose only purpose is to be a face in front of sci-fi ideas, some of which are just plain goofy.I realize that this book was written in 1954, and that things were different back then. I tried to give this book a chance because of that fact, and I think that keeping that in mind is the only reason I made it to the end. I think if I had read Asimov as a kid, I would have loved it, but I just can't get into his writing now, because I cannot deal with his idiotic characters. The only character who is intelligent throughout the book is the robot, which would be interesting if the robot was the protagonist, but since we are instead treated to chapters full of inane dialogue between a dumb \"detective\" and his even more idiotic wife, it's very hard to deal with.I gave this book two stars instead of one, because the denouement was actually good enough to make up for some of the headache of the earlier chapters. The detective finally wises up in the end, and the plot comes together fairly well.I think the appeal of Asimov has been his invention and ideas, specifically things like Artificial Intelligence, which there really wasn't a precedent for, or certainly not much of one, in the 1950s. He was a very clever person, but at least from what I have read of his books so far, Foundation and The Caves of Steel (I started I, Robot, and just couldn't keep going with it), he was not a very good storyteller.This book had a couple of moments that were enjoyable and well-written, primarily the two or three action scenes, and the denouement. They are not enough, in my opinion, to carry the book through the obnoxious character interactions and the pages of time where a trained detective is basically clutching his head and passing out because he can't handle a small challenge to his beliefs or worldview."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "4.5 to 5.0 stars.

Per quanto sia banale da dire, mi piace quando un romanzo di genere fantascientifico abbraccia talmente tante sfaccettature della societ\u00e0 o dell'uomo in generale da far sembrare riduttivo definirlo un \"libro di genere\". Qui si aggiunge poi lo squisito piacere della storia condito da cos\u00ec tante varianti pertinenti gi\u00e0 solo alla trama, prima che ai vari significati che emergono dalla storia. Da una parte c'\u00e8 la costruzione di un mondo futuro articolata e nient'affatto banale, dove il genio, l'inventiva di Asimov realizzano delle soluzioni che solleticano l'immaginazione. \u00c8 stuzzicante vagare per la Citt\u00e0 figurandosela in un'immagine complessiva, ma \u00e8 piacevole anche la cura del dettaglio nella vita quotidiana dei personaggi, simile e allo stesso tempo diversa dalla nostra. Mi \u00e8 stato impossibile non provare costantemente ammirazione per le varie soluzioni inventive adottate. L'elemento fantascientifico, poi, si unisce al genere della detective story, causando una curiosit\u00e0 famelica di sapere come si sviluppa l'indagine, sapientemente pungolata dai plot twists (che riescono ad essere realmente tali). Il protagonista poliziotto, Bailey, mi ha ricordato per certi versi altri commissari o detective, pur restando un personaggio unico. Ha un modo di collegare gli elementi sempre attivo, ma inconscio e introverso, e in questo mi ha ricordato Adamsberg di Fred Vargas, difatti le teorie del suo personaggio sono dei veri e propri fulmini, come degli eureka che poi dipana ad alta voce in modo inesorabilmente logico. C'\u00e8 un insieme di intuito e audacia, visto che ha il talento di cavare le proprie teorie nei momenti pi\u00f9 tesi, rischiando sempre anche per se stesso, c'\u00e8 di conseguenza anche dell'improvvisazione e ansie derivate, che lo rendono decisamente umano, in grado di suscitare empatia di pi\u00f9 rispetto a un detective flemmatico come Poirot o Sherlock Holmes - e poi c'\u00e8 comunque una logica sorprendente. Molto affascinante, in pi\u00f9 ogni personaggio presentava un carattere distinto, curato, e la coppia Bailey-Daleen \u00e8 effettivamente indimenticabile. A tal proposito mi ha colpito il rigore dei loro confronti lavorativi, e le conclusioni tratte da ogni confronto non erano affatto banali, ma raffinate, mostrando un lato della grande intelligenza del romanzo. Parlando proprio dell'intelligenza del libro, il complesso sociale qua creato \u00e8 anche stimolante per come riesca ad ancorarsi ad una realt\u00e0 sociale, politica reale, e per certi versi anticipatrice, volontariamente o meno, di tendenze sociali future. Ad esempio il conflitto tra gli abitanti della Citt\u00e0 e i robot \u00e8 assolutamente credibile nel suo contesto particolare e di finzione, ma allo stesso tempo rimanda molto acutamente ad un generale rapporto che una certa fetta di umanit\u00e0 perlopi\u00f9 reazionaria ha con il nuovo e il diverso. Non mi arrischio in una dettagliata comparazione politica, in quanto non avrei neanche delle conoscenze adeguate per farlo, per\u00f2 ho in mente un momento iniziale decisamente esemplare. Si tratta dell'interazione tra una donna umana e un robot in un negozio di scarpe, dove lei si mette in bocca parole che ha sentito dai medievalisti, cio\u00e8 che tanto per cominciare lei non voleva essere servita da un commesso robot, perch\u00e9 pensava di meritare un trattamento migliore, e in pi\u00f9, poi, nell'agitazione, afferma che i robot rubano il lavoro ai \"terrestri\", e che si pensa tanto a loro, e poco invece alla Terra. Con i leitmotiv martellanti del \"[inserire qui gruppo di immigrati] rubano il lavoro agli italiani\" e \"prima gli italiani\" e \"mandiamoli a casa\" etc \u00e8 impossibile non pensare a certi politici poco stimabili e i loro adepti..e non c'\u00e8 neanche bisogno di fare nomi. Per quanto non sia una situazione tanto simile da combaciare perfettamente, la rigidit\u00e0, lo sprezzo psicologico e sociale ha molti punti in comune e mi \u00e8 sembrato notevole che a cos\u00ec tanti decenni di distanza Asimov potesse risultare, anche per una situazione politica internazionale propria del nostro presente, cos\u00ec attuale, cos\u00ec fresco ancora negli spunti di riflessione che pu\u00f2 dare. In questo senso sarebbe interessante approfondire i punti di contatto, specialmente nel momento in cui il romanzo e il nostro presente presentano in modo molto accentuato, dettato da paure, odio irrazionale, l'innalzamento di barriere su barriere non solo politiche, ma pi\u00f9 generalmente sociali, umane (barriere mentali), di reclusione in un proprio territorio o in un proprio sistema, estromettendo o allontanandosi da alcuni legami internazionali percepiti come \"dannosi\" o \"pericolosi\". Inoltre nei medievalisti qui ritratti con scorrevolezza e allo stesso tempo ricchezza, tanto da poter essere letti e riletti su pi\u00f9 livelli, c'\u00e8 il ritorno a una situazione originaria ideale, un culto del passato di tipo rurale e un atteggiamento aggressivo, di soppressione di un elemento che rappresenta la contemporaneit\u00e0 tanto odiata, il marcio di un sistema economico in cui non si ritrovano. E c'\u00e8 la degenerazione pericolosa di questo atteggiamento, come la resistenza ottusa (ma non troppo) rispetto ad altre alternative di evoluzione, cambiamento rispetto alla societ\u00e0 attuale, oltre al fatto che cui l'elemento su cui si ostinano diventa un puro capro espiatorio (poveri robot), su cui vengono canalizzati rancori, emozioni pi\u00f9 che argomentazioni logiche condivisibili, ricordando comunque alcune tendenze politiche di gruppi estremi che Asimov conosceva di certo, e da cui il mondo si stava staccando traumaticamente nel momento della pubblicazione del romanzo, cio\u00e8 il 1954. C'\u00e8 poi un'ulteriore linea altrettanto stimolante, inventiva e ricca in merito ad una societ\u00e0 di tipo cooperativo e non individualista, con i suoi vantaggi, ma anche i suoi eccessi, con le sue contraddizioni, specialmente nel momento in cui Asimov volutamente pone il conflitto tra un desiderio istintivo, insopprimibile della conquista di un proprio spazio (esempio: la questione del bagno privato e altri lussi, in generale la questione, dei privilegi conquistati con l'avanzamento della carriera) e poi la tendenza di un sistema sociale che impone invece la dissimulazione continua di uno status elevato, di una comodit\u00e0 particolare, tanto da spingere i \"privilegiati\" a non usufruire nemmeno dei propri privilegi, rendendo la loro presenza problematica, con varie controversie psicologiche. Ma ad un livello pi\u00f9 intimo, \u00e8 sottile il rapporto costruito pian piano tra Bailey e Daneel, dove Bailey lascia risuonare una generale diffidenza, una gamma di sentimenti sfumata, complessa, tra s\u00e9 e la macchina, sviluppando poi un'evoluzione del rapporto e chiarendo cosa rimane unicamente umano e cosa c'\u00e8 in comune, quali sono le familiarit\u00e0 su cui si pu\u00f2 costruire un rapporto positivo, di aiuto reciproco e ovviamente di efficienza produttiva con i robot. Nello stesso protagonista risuona un discorso molto intelligente, saggio e profondo sull'interazione con il diverso, sul compromesso necessario per poter andare avanti,su uno sfruttamento di una situazione del presente per un futuro che si concili con la volont\u00e0 di poter vedere un mondo diverso in modo pratico, moderno; sull'interazione tra il rigore legale, logico e la compassione, e sull'equilibrio necessario tra di essi.Una cosa che mi piace tantissimo, direi, \u00e8 che si possono dire, ampliare tante cose rispetto ai temi del libro, e questo \u00e8 sempre un evidente segno del fatto che ci si trova a contatto con una base fertile, con un romanzo molto stratificato, coinvolgente e bellissimo rispetto a tanti aspetti."}, {"userName": "Nikola Pavlovic", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52813923-nikola-pavlovic", "userReview": "Zanimljiva detektivska prica smestena u buducnost u kojoj imamo zemljane, svemirce (potomke ljudi sa zemlje koji zive na mesecu i ostalim novootkrivenim planetima a koji su na dosta visem tehnoloskom stupnju od zemljana) i naravno robote.

Durante la mia ultima capatina in libreria per\u00f2 la curiosit\u00e0 ha avuto il sopravvento, anzitutto grazie a ci\u00f2 che ho trovato scritto nella quarta di copertina che sa molto di poliziesco/mystery, facendo poi scorrere la prefazione ho visto: \u201cCi\u00f2 che ha fatto Asimov - in una lunga serie di racconti e in alcuni romanzi, di cui questo \u00e8 il primo\u2026\u201d, beh a quel punto l\u2019acquisto \u00e8 diventato obbligato.

Danell Olivaw, that are the more compelling and fascinating. \"The Caves of Steel\" is the first (and best of the four) entry in the series, introducing us to Bailey, Daneel and a future world in which humanity lives inside massive, interconnected steel domes. Humans rarely venture outside and Earth is slowly dying due to overpopulation. A group of aliens called Spacers are colonizing other worlds, using robotic help but have limited how and where humanity can colonize. When a Spacer is killed, Bailey is called upon to solve the case. Bailey must overcome his prejudice toward Spacers and robots to work on the case and with the robotic partner. It's the conflict between Bailey's dislike and distrust of robots and Spacers that drives a lot of the novel and makes it an utterly compelling, character-driven, world-building effort by Issac Asimov. If you've only read his \"Foundation\" novels, you've missed out on one of the biggest pleasures in all of science-fiction by overlooking the Robot stories. Yes, later in life Asimov did work to tie these books into the Foundation series, but the first three in the series can be enjoyed purely on their own merits.Add to all that world-building, a fairly well done murder mystery and you may have one of the most perfect gems in not only science-fiction but also all of literature. Asimov said that he could create a mystery within a sci-fi story without having to resort to a deus ex machine type of resolution and he does here. He establishes the rules for the universe early in the novel and doesn't change them to fit the ending or solution he wants or needs. A fascinating book and one of my favorites. Definitely worth reading or reading again."}, {"userName": "notgettingenough ", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2658311-notgettingenough", "userReview": "You can see why Asimov thinks he's great shakes.

Earth civilization labors under the pressures of overpopulation and all citizens live under vast domes of metal and concrete\u2014the titular caves of steel. Further, robots are making inroads on the human labor market, causing even more distress. On the flipside is Spacetown where \u2018Spacers\u2019 live. Spacers are offworld colonists used to low population, relative wealth, and long life spans. They maintain an outpost just outside of the New York City dome, but there is tension between Spacers and their earth brethren kept from boiling over by the narrowest of margins. The book opens just after the Spacetown murder of Spacer ambassador Roj Nemmenuh Sarton. Detective Elijah Bailey is called upon to investigate with the condition that he be given a Spacer partner. That partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, turns out to be a robot. Bailey is initially taken aback and harbors his own anti-robot prejudices, which he must overcome as the case progresses. To further complicate matters, they only have a limited amount of time to figure out what happens before the case turns into a diplomatic disaster.Kind of work defined by basic elements (character, plot, setting, language, theme)\u2014what elements are foregrounded? How do they fit together?: (2-4 paragraphs) From the opening paragraphs, we understand the world is distressed. Elijah examines his tobacco pouch and ponders how far he can stretch it until the \u2018next quota day.\u2019 From there, Asimov pulls no punches in illustrating how an over-stretched and under-resourced population might exist. They eat vat grown yeasts and live in vast enclosed infrastructures, travel by stepping onto extensive networks of pedestrian conveyors. The plot itself is fairly basic\u2014the odd couple formula in sci fi. Two disparate investigators are paired together and must overcome their differences in order to solve the mystery at hand. What is unique is that it is a sci fi mystery. These are not genres typically combined.Asimov uses this format and the strictures of his Rules of Robotics to explore the nature of man and the perceived limitations of machines and does so with direct, uncluttered language.Kind of work defined by structure\u2014how is it constructed? (1-2 paragraphs).Asimov smartly grounds the narrative in a 3rd person limited POV\u2014namely Elijah Bailey\u2019s. We see what he sees, understand his prejudices, and see how they work themselves out in his thought process. It also keeps from being too startled at the bleak world Asimov portrays. A life without sun enclosed in domes. To Elijah this is normal, and within this environment he has the same hopes for betterment we all do. It\u2019s just that his version of better is likely much more modest than our own.Beyond that, the book is divided into eighteen episodic chapters, each a centering on small dramatic moments or turns of events. This is in line with other detective fiction I\u2019ve read and the piecemeal revelations maintain tension throughout the novel. Kind of work defined by theme, interests--(1-2 paragraphs). The overt detective story contains within it some interesting premises. The first posits that the most humane solution to an overpopulated earth is colonization. Further, we must perpetually endeavor to overcome our fears as a society (here symbolized by the perpetual agoraphobia the residents of the caves of steel suffer from) in order to advance and better ourselves.The second is our response to the \u2018other\u2019\u2014here, robots. The earth population\u2019s reactions to robots are easily recognizable. Job displacement and irrational fear create resentment that can erupt into violence. The possibility of world where the robots and their creators co-exist is explored and mirrors earth\u2019s own struggles with racial and ethnic tensions and our own distress at seeing ourselves replaced by automation.Overall effectiveness of piece\u2014its strengths (1-2 paragraphs).  This was a fast read. Asimov explains a great deal without over-lingering on detail. The mystery itself is well-constructed and doesn\u2019t cheat\u2014all of the elements are presented within the plot and we learn how they fit together as we go. Further, the character of Daneel Olivaw is fascinating. He is so close to human, yet Asimov manages to convey that he isn\u2019t quite and is yet in some ways better and more moral.Where would you alter the text, why, how?\u2014its potential weaknesses (1-2 paragraphs). While the story is solid, Asimov\u2019s prose is at times clunky and awkward. And the ending wraps up with too many speeches explaining all of the reasoning behind the deductions that solved the case. While I grant that this sort of thing is necessary at times, in this instance it came across as rushed and unnatural.Finally, your overall analysis of this piece holistically (1 page maximum) This was an effective pulp detective mystery with a sci fi setting. Asimov effectively uses a single point of view to both humanize the story and limit our knowledge of the mystery, thus creating a natural tension. He maintains a brisk narrative pace by keeping summary exposition to a minimum.From this platform, he explores potential problems for humanity (overpopulation, job displacement due to mechanization) and posits potential solutions (colonization, socially integrated robots). Further, within the framework of his Laws of Robotics, he examines human nature and the questions the true substance of morality. Is morality defined by being able to do something but not acting on the impulse? Or being simply incapable of the action to begin with?"}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17629329-leah", "userReview": "Jehoshaphat! It's tremendous...!In the far distant future, Earth has become vastly overcrowded and the strain on resources has forced humanity into living cheek by jowl in massive closed in cities \u2013 the caves of steel of the title. They no longer ever venture into the outside world, having basic robots to do any outside work that's needed. Living accommodation is small \u2013 meals are taken in huge communal kitchens and bathing and toileting facilities are all contained in the Personals, again communal and with strict social rules to preserve some semblance of privacy. The Outer Worlds are inhabited by Spacers, the descendants of people from Earth who colonised some of the planets thousands of years earlier. Spacer worlds are the opposite of Earth \u2013 underpopulated and disease free. Spacers no longer allow immigration from Earth, guarding the comparative luxury of their lives, along with their health. Naturally, they are resented by the people of Earth.Spacers have developed much more advanced robots and, with the agreement of the government of Earth, are introducing them into Earth society. The robots are hated since people see them as a threat to their jobs, and loss of a job can mean loss of the few privileges that people can still have \u2013 their own washbasin, the right to an occasional meal in their own home. So when a Spacer robotocist is murdered, it seems obvious the culprit will be an Earth person. Elijah Bailey, C-Class Detective is called in to investigate and, to his horror, is partnered with a Spacer robot, R. Daneel Olivaw, so advanced that he can easily pass as human.This is sci-fi... but it's also a great murder mystery. Proper crime with all different kinds of motivations at work, clues, detection, departmental politics, the works! Asimov wrote it after someone challenged him by saying sci-fi and mystery were incompatible genres. Asimov's own view was that sci-fi can incorporate any literary genre, and this is his proof. Along with the mystery Asimov creates a fairly chilling view of a possible future if Earth's population continues to increase. It's fairly easy 60 years on to pick holes in some of the things he foresaw, and didn't, and personally, doing that is one of the great pleasures for me. I love that he could create something as sophisticated as the positronic brain \u2013 still being used by sci-fi writers as the basis for robots and androids today \u2013 but didn't think of the mobile phone, so that poor Lije has to go out to phone boxes in the middle of the night. I love that he claimed that women still stuck to traditional clasps on their purses rather than adopting new-style magnetic catches. (We finally made it, Mr Asimov! We advanced that far!) I love that he came up with a kind of method for information retrieval that sounds not unlike the old punch-card system, but couldn't take the extra leap that would have led him to computers. I love that people happily use all kinds of nuclear devices, cheerfully spraying radiation around as they go. He almost comes up with an e-reader... but not quite...But the basic idea of an over-populated world where every human activity is carefully regimented and controlled to make best use of dwindling resources is very well done, and the resentment of humans over machines taking over their jobs has proved to be pretty prophetic. The Medievalists who look nostalgically back to a time not unlike the 1950s have more than a little in common with our more fundamentalist back-to-the-earth green groups of today. One of the other things I love about the Elijah Bailey books is that, although the world is thousands of years older, all the people are stuck in a '50s time-warp. Gee, gosh, the language is simply tremendous! Lije's favourite exclamation is \u201cJehoshaphat!\u201d - I always find myself using it for weeks after I've read one of the books. The women stay at home, try to look pretty for their husbands and bring up the children, which is all their limited brains and talents are really fit for, while the men go off and do manly things, like science and running about the streets with blasters and such like. So you not only get a look at how Asimov saw the possible future, but you get a real picture of '50s American life thrown in for free.The plot is great and totally fair-play. Lije's detection methods are a bit on the slapdash side, I admit \u2013 basically, he decides whodunit, accuses them, is proved wrong, and then decides it was actually someone else... and so on. But each accusation adds something, both to his future guesswork, and to the reader's understanding of the society he's operating in. And Jehoshaphat! When the solution finally comes, it's a good one!Golly gee, I hope you read this book. It may be a bit dated, but it's still loads of fun and with plenty of interest to either sci-fi or mystery fans.

How colossally wrong was I?The Caves of Steel, in first look, even with all its futuristic contrivances, could be tagged as the grandfather of all those buddy detective action movies from Lethal Weapon to 21 Jump Street. In second look, it felt more like Dick\u2019s muse for Blade Runner, expect, here the detective was paired with a humanoid-android capable of dreaming about all kinds of sheep. But with a third and more civilized look, it becomes an unintentionally metaphysical work dealing with xenophobia, refugee crisis and neo-imperialism, while being a suspenseful detective mystery at the same time.I couldn\u2019t help but compare the less understood universe of this novel with the one in PKD's \n\u2018Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\u2019\n. A depressed yet brilliant(confused yet brilliant) police officer Deckard(Elijah) with a further depressed(confused and complex) wife, living in a future post-apocalyptic(agoraphobic) earth, getting mixed up deep in an investigation involving Androids(Robots). They both live in Earth by choice as I remember and The Caves of Steel even suggests a \u2018Voight-Kampff\u2019 questionnaire of its own by the end.Anti Robot sentiment, resentment and the growing sense of human superiority could be better understood If one attempt to read it along with neo-fascism and recent refugee crisis. The \u2018medievalist\u2019 conservatism under the allegory of Spacers and Earthmen, was Asimov's way of predicting the rise demagogues and nationalists in his near future, not withstanding the strange premise and anachronism of prophecy. The dream for coexistence in C/Fe culture, the witty chemistry between Baley and R.Daneel, Biblical backstory of Elijah and Jezebel (quite complementing to the story if you ask me), solid investigation filled with red herrings entwined in classic sci fi, made my stealth library read worthwhile. I am even inclined to accuse Mission Impossible on stealing from this.And climbing further up the weird ladder, \u2018Jehoshaphat\u2019 is my new favourite daily life expletive from now on."}], "description": "A millennium into the future two advancements have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain.
