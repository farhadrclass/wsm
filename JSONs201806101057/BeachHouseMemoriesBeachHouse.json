After getting bits of their tale in the first installment, I had to get the details. Torn between duty and her hearts desire, this journey is very emotional, and at times the despair is palpable.

My heart soared and broke right along with Lovie. I adored her character after the first two books but to find out her story...Wow! It is an amazing journey of heartache, love, loss, devotion, and friendship.Growing up and still going to the beach every summer I've always loved the ocean and all it's marvelous creatures. However, after reading Beach House and Swimming Lessons my love for sea turtles grew. Beach House Memories shines so much more light on Lovie's devotion to them. Not only is it a great read, it's inspiring as well (like so many of Mary Alice's books!). I encourage anyone who has read this book to get involved with the efforts to protect the sea turtles. If you're not lucky enough to live near the beach or be part of a turtle team, you can help by inspiring others, educating them, sharing your love of sea turtles (and these books!) or adpoting a sea turtle! There are many links on Mary Alice's website to guide you! Coincidentally, the year I met Mary Alice at a bookstore in Emerald Isle, I saw my first turtle nest hatch! It is one of my personal favorite \"beach house memories\". Thank you Mary Alice Monroe for another wonderful story! I can't wait for your next one!!**If you loved this book for the turtles, check out The Butterfly's Daughter!

How exciting to witness the miraculous journey of the Mother Loggerhead as well as the babies back to the sea! They have to overcome such adversity and dangers just to survive. It is my sincerest hope that the Loggerhead Turtle Project is still functioning and that many lives are saved as a result. I wish we had Loggerheads on the West Coast. I, too, am a beach girl, having grown up on California 's Central Coast . Many days during my youth were spent running the beaches with my sisters. Such glorious, carefree days! It is, again, quite obvious that Ms. Monroe does her homework! The research that went into writing BEACH HOUSE MEMORIES is immense! I truly enjoy a book written by an author who has become an expert on the subject by research and actual hands-on experience. There is great joy eveident throughout the telling of the tale of the Loggerheads, although, in many ways, the book is actually quite sad. I feel good for Lovie overall, as she took a stand against Stratton and that he abided her wishes when reconciling their marriage. I can relate to her in that we, as women, most often have to give up a part of who we really are when we become someone's wife, someone's Mother, someone's daughter, someone's something or other...our true selves get placed on the back burner for many years and we are often not even aware that this has happened until something or someone, like Russell Bennett, comes along and there is a new dawning within us. I loved this story and already have plans to pass it on to my twin sister who, like me, is a Loggerhead lover! She can't wait to read it."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5375148-beth", "userReview": "Lovie, Olivia, has spent her grown life being the perfect wife, homemaker and best mother she could be. Her husband shows little appreciation for what Lovie does for his family and business as long as she keeps his cultivated professional appearance. Deciding to further his career goals her husband decides to go to Europe and not spend time with his family this summer.Lovie takes her 2 children to her beach home, the only place she finds solace and can be herself. The people of Isle of Palm know Lovie as the Turtle Lady, she has been keeping track of the nesting turtles for over 10 years\u2026a love she learned from her father. This year Dr. Russell Bennett, sea turtle specialist, arrives on Isle of Palm to do an impact study on the development of the North end of the island on the nesting turtles. After a rocky start Dr. Bennett is extremely impressed with Lovie\u2019s journals and information she kept on the turtles and it begins a strong friendship and camaraderie. I once again am not going any further because I don\u2019t want to accidently give anything away, so here\u2019s my thoughts on Beach House Memories...First off, I have to admit I\u2019m a little bias because I already have a passion for Sea Turtle Conservation. I highly recommend that everyone should experience sea turtle at least once! That being said, Mary Alice Monroe wrote this beautifully vivid story of love, loss, growing up, friendship and life that will touch your heart. Her colorful and expressive story of the South Caroline coast makes you feel like your feet are engulfed in the warm sand and the mosquitoes are buzzing in your ears. Although, at times I wanted to throttle the female character's choices, I do realize I\u2019m living 30+ years in the future and the women back then did have different circumstances. Wonderful story telling, heart-felt read and turtles, what else can I say but I loved it.This copy was given to me by Goodreads First Reads and Gallery Books in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "Three and a half stars. I couldn\u2019t help but bring this home from the library as the cover reminded me very much of my favourite beach near where I live in Australia. Plus I like Mary Alice Munroe\u2019s books. This is the third story I have read featuring Lovie Rutledge \u2013The Turtle Lady and I enjoyed finding out exactly what happened to Lovie in 1974. When visiting biologist Russell Bennett appears on the Isle of Palms, Lovie is prepared to dislike him thinking he does not have the interests of the island and her beloved sea turtles at heart. That changes once she gets to know him more. A difficult marriage with Stratton who expects Lovie to be the perfect Southern wife raising a perfectly behaved and ladylike daughter, and at the same time turn a blind eye to his absences and affairs takes its toll on Lovie. But that is nothing to what happens when she finds herself falling involve with Russell and considering divorce.I was interested in the way relationships developed in the story though it did remind me a little of Nights in Rodanthe by Nicholas Sparks. I found the story more interesting when it moved away from feeding me information about the turtles and more onto the relationships. Maybe three books about turtles were too many for this person. Still a very enjoyable story and worth reading."}, {"userName": "Shayla Drumm", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6007450-shayla-drumm", "userReview": "This was an amazing book; I'm so lucky I won it on Goodreads! Set in South Carolina, Beach House Memories is a wonderful blend of romance, nature, and women's issues. Lovie, the main character, is a young mother of two with a passion for sea turtles. Some of her struggles are unique to the time period such as the expectation that women should stay at home with the children. But the importance of raising children while trying to maintain some sense of individualism remains the same today. I think women will always have different challenges than men simply because the ties to our children are different. I have only been to South Carolina as a child so I don't remember a lot, but after reading this book I would love to visit. The description of both the beach town and Charleston are so vivid and enticing. As an animal lover it would be a thrill beyond belief to see a mama turtle climb up the beach to lay eggs or see the hatchlings return to the ocean. This book is a must-read and I'll be passing it along to friends and family so they can enjoy it also. I will also be checking out more books by Mary Alice Monroe."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15852313-mary", "userReview": "~ Third book completed in May #CleanSweepARC Challenge.~This will not be the first time I've mentioned how much I love the Lowcountry. It will certainly not be the last; it's one of my favorite southern fictional settings. Monroe's love for the Lowcountry is also evident in her stories. This time, she has combined her passion for the beautiful coastal islands and the preservation of loggerhead sea turtles and their hatchlings. Mary Alice tells two stories here really, one of Olivia Rutledge, a woman trying to make a difference in her beloved beach community, who's trying to hold on to her family, love, and memories. Second, and what I found most interesting, a story that revolves around preserving the nests of sea turtles and protecting the defenseless hatchlings from destruction, development, and predators. In the end, Olivia is not much different from the mother sea turtle. Both get their strength from the sea and return year after year to a beach home that's in their blood.

I re-read The Beach House, before reading this pre-quel that was published ten years later to refresh my memory of the characters. I think this novel was even better! The characters are believable, likable and recognizable to those of us lucky enough to live in South Carolina. The coast is a special place, and true to herself, Mary Alice encourages her readers to respect the wildlife in our state. You can genuinely feel Lovie's relief when she escapes her schoolyear schedule to play with her children and friends at the beach for the summer. Having visited Isle of Palms for years, I was also entranced with her depiction of the topography and the natives prior to Wild Dunes development. You will wish you were sitting on the dunes with Lovie, watching a sea turtle nest erupting with new life! Once you walk into The Beach House, you won't want to leave.

The beach where we stay is a turtle nesting site, so I loved reading about the main character's passion for sea turtles. I found myself fully wrapped up in the story and having a hard time putting the book down. The love story and dilemma the main character faced really had me thinking about how different women's options were in the 1970's in the low country as compared to now.

I love how she weaves nature into the story and uses it's facts as a metaphor for what is going on in the story. Throughout this series, we get to see all aspects of Loggerhead turtles who nest at the Isle of Palms. It's in each book in this series. This book is so great because we go back in time to an illicit romance that meant so much to Lovie in the mid seventies. It's about Russell Bennett and how he came into her life. He is mentioned in the first book of the series and you wonder about him. Well read this book and wonder no more. The love story does get a bit melodramatic at times, which makes it a little less believable to me. But maybe that's just me. Other than that, I loved this story. I got to meet the author at my favorite little book shop in Woodstock, GA - FoxTale Book Shoppe. Love that place. Mary Alice is so down to earth and an informed conservationist. She said she researches an animal first then dreams up a story around it. I had read three books in this series when I met her. I asked her what ever happened to \"Big Girl\" the Loggerhead turtle that is saved in book 2, Swimming Lessons. I asked if she could come back in a later book because don't the turtles keep coming back to nest? Her eyes got really big and she looked off in the distance---thinking. Then she said I never thought of that. She said there will need to be a 5th book in the series, now. She announced to the whole room! Yeh! I hope that happens. I really like her writing style. She's good with setting, best, and also good with character development. This book and the rest are highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Jennie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69192372-jennie", "userReview": "An easy read, though not as predictable as I thought, while half way through.

Coincidentally, we were staying at that now-built resort! Basically a light love story, I thought it was well written with interesting characters. For me, the many Charleston area references and historical tidbits peppered throughout, as well as the environmental theme and the detail about loggerhead turtles, made up for the pleasant but somewhat predictable story line.

She paints this amazing picture of love, loss, and a fulfillment. Her writing instantly transported me to the beaches at the Isle of Palms, which my family travels to often, and I was mesmerized by how much I genuinely could picture every scene she described. The setting and Lovie\u2019s work with the turtles on the beaches were enough to read this book, and surely are enough for me to recommend it. Lovie is invested in her time spent at Primrose Cottage and her research with the Loggerhead Turtles becomes extensive and detailed as well.

I never tire of reading of life on the Isle of Palms, Sullivan's Island, and Charleston...life in the South. Monroe's intertwining of the adventures Lovie has with the annual sea turtle migration, and the expectations of women's roles in the 1970's, especially Southern women, is both philosophical and psychological. One of the study guide questions is: How ere the issues of class, women's rights, and spousal abuse handled 1974 and how have things changed in modern times: What choices do women today have in cases of abuse? Do you think abuse against women crosses economic lines? Did Lovie make the right choice? why or why not? Would she have made the same choice if she were 39 in the year 2012?It's the story of the anatomy of marital expectations and how they are interwoven with cultural and family expectations. Tradition vs love. What mothers are willing to sacrifice for their children.Compromise. I dare say, a Lovie of the year 2012 would have made a different choice. But, would it have resulted in happiness? Once a woman becomes a mother, does her duty to her children outweigh what might be her only chance for happiness? Looking at the crisis in family in the present time, maybe Lovie has a message for all of us. As Monroe uses Lovie's reflections on the sea turtles, to find balance in her decisions, she shows us, that not enough of us have the will to see the big picture when making decisions regarding our personal happiness."}, {"userName": "Maegan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12274903-maegan", "userReview": "I'm giving this book a 4 on the chick-lit scale.

But what I learned from Lovie's experiences is there are woman who sorely regret past decisions made based on traditions, fears, insecurities, and expectations of others.
