The protagonist, Grace Collins, seems to be unable to do any wrong, and the rest of the characters tended to be rather two-dimensional. The dialogue is rather stilted and also lacks characterisation.I didn't dislike this book, in many ways it was very interesting, and it kept me reading right up to the last page, but I wanted more out of it: it could have been better."}, {"userName": "J.C. Greenway", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8517539-j-c-greenway", "userReview": "This is a cracking tale, apparently based on a true story, but unfortunately John Sweeney doesn't manage to fully do it justice. The characters are very weak, with heroine Grace too good to be true and a bad guy who is 100% villain. Out of sixty-odd children in the school, only a few are even honoured with names and they fade into the background when not needed to push the plot along. Too much is told, not shown - with a lot of interesting back stories glossed over - and the relationships don't always ring true. Grace very easily casts aside her upbringing to fall deeply in love with an Indian man, these feelings developing from first glance to sleeping with him to 'love of her life' in a surprisingly short amount of time. Yes, wartime and all of that, but it's quite the display of brazenness. She follows this up by falling for the geeky fellow she had dismissed out of hand earlier in the book. That said, there are some beautiful descriptions of the terrain this odd party of refugees is passing through. Once the action got going, after they left Rangoon, I did get more immersed in the story. It just felt to me like a good first draft, rather than the finished article."}, {"userName": "Paul Sheppard", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11819241-paul-sheppard", "userReview": "One if the best books I've read the year.

I had a vague idea of the contradictory reviews of the readers, but I seldom let negative opinions influence me when it comes to historical fiction, if I am really interested in the era and the subject.I hadn't read any work of fiction or non - fiction, before I started reading Elephant Moon, about Burma and the region as a whole during the Second World War, so I was completely invested in the story. John Sweeney's writing is simple and beautiful at the same time. When he describes the jungle, the city market, the suburbs and the school, I am able to envision the scenes without feeling as if I am reading Travel Literature. The dialogue flows naturally with a nice touch of '40s English colloquialisms and tasteful hints of humour. It is a difficult, unusual subject, and delicate, since Grace Collins, a young, British schoolteacher, has the duty of leading 60 children out of the jungle - that can become a battlefield anytime - aided by a few brave men and some astonishing, beautiful creatures, the elephants. However, the real danger lurked much closer to them than they had imagined.I liked Grace as a heroine. She was believable, brave, level-headed and stood her ground against sexim and discrimination. Did she fall in love a little too easily? Yes, so? Most of us do, anyway. Sam and Bertie are fascinating gentlemen. Gregory is one of the vilest, most malicious and despicable literary creations I've ever come across, reminiscent of the Victorian evil antagonists that have no redeeming qualities whatsoever.So, my two cents about Elephant Moon? Don't be dissuaded by the polarized reviews, give it a chance and see if you enjoy it. Do not expect Forster's A Passage to India, but a well-written, refreshing novel about brave people and even braver animals."}, {"userName": "Cassandra", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8220304-cassandra", "userReview": "As somebody on Amazon said, this book can be described as \"very put downable\". It would have been great had the characters been expanded upon and the story not sensationalised. To me, it read like a screenplay, where they take a story and \"flatten\" it out so that only the biggest events take place in the film. It was meant to be a fictional testament to the struggles refugees in Burma had to face, but I felt as if it disrespected the genuine history by adding gore, violence and unlikable characters.Having said that, if the writer invested more time into character development, the story as a whole would have improved. I generally enjoyed the story, but I felt as if I was only reading the headlines. So much more could have been done to create a novel. Instead, the author created a work of simple pop fiction which I struggled to enjoy."}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17315128-meredith", "userReview": "Is it a romance hidden in a war story, or a war story hidden in a romance? There's a lot of drama and intrigue, almost too much; the weight is a bit heavy for this little story to bear. There are more than a few cliches weighing the book down, and its characters labour under laughable and predictable story mechanics. It seems that in trying to include too many story avenues, the book falls short in conveying the full menace of the situations. The dynamics and personalities of the elephants are well described, at least as much as those of the humans. There's also a singular event in this story after which everything else that happens is an anticlimax. The cover art design is weak, and the ending is very abrupt and clunky."}, {"userName": "Avery Delany", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11190922-avery-delany", "userReview": "It's a shame that I could only give this 3 star's as the book held promise, but had so many downfalls. Whilst the book picks up in the middle and really saves the experience, the beginning is a massive drag. As others have said, once you put the book down its hard to pick up again. Several times I almost gave up, but kept going out of curiosity and it was much easier once you meet the Jemadar. I really enjoyed the middle of the book. I found many of the characters unlikable in the beginning, and felt like the adding of several characters (Jem, Havildir and Sam) really helped the story along. The ending of the book also really let it down. The beginning was a massive drag, and the end turned out to be horrifically rushed. Towards the end, several massive subplots are wrapped up all in the space of a chapter, and yet the author can happily drag out English elite life in Burma and trekking through a jungle into numerous chapters without any end in sight. this was one of the biggest disappointments. I almost felt like I had stuck with the book for nothing. Additionally, the writing is, for the most part, very pretentious and clunky. Sentences can go on forever, kept going by random commas instead of starting a new sentence. This is particularly obvious in the beginning and Something which I found difficult to get over. I only paid a pound for this in the Amazon sale, and I do feel like it was worth it foe that small amount of money. Once I got over the pitfalls, I really did enjoy it and became fascinated by some of the characters (including a soft spot for the elephants). Based on an incredible event, it really is worth a read if you can stick with it"}, {"userName": "Lynette", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14130853-lynette", "userReview": "DNF at 25%. Here's the proof that getting the free sample from Amazon doesn't guarantee you won't waste your money. I thought that sample was good enough to warrant buying the book, reviews are very good.

Without Mother and Oomy the book would have lost another star.What makes it so mediocre are the human protagonists who are cleanly divided into a lot of noble goodies and one evil baddy and the stereotypes are all there : the plucky, stunningly beautiful, golden-haired, blue-eyed young teacher that no man can resist, the dashing, tiger-eyed, mysterious Jemadar with a dark secret, the old spinster headmistress of the orphanage, the boring and pompous British colonel, the slightly ridiculous, awkward lieutenant who turns into a hero, etc. etc. etc. The dialogues are often terrible, there are some cringeworthy romantic scenes, some wild coincidences and the last chapters are predictable and ridiculous, pure Hollywood !!(Also, from all I\u2019ve read about the British raj, I find the degree of familiarity which Grace and the Jemadar share from the first highly implausible.)"}, {"userName": "Lilly_fantastico", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164616-lilly-fantastico", "userReview": "This is perhaps one of the best books I've read in a long time. By turns gripping and moving, not just because you know the story is true (or at least inspired by true events), but because the narrative is well-paced, seamlessly written, and the characters almost tangible. From the very first sentence, one is immediately transported into 1940s Burma, one can immediately conjure a full and vital image of each character. It's a cliche, but it's apt: \"you're there\".Sweeney is as excellent a novelist as he is a journalist - although there's no surprise there. What is surprising is how convincingly and thoroughly he describes the workings of the female mind in the face of the catastrophic and the absurd. It was difficult to remember, at times, that the book was not written by a woman.Although fictional, the characters are strikingly realistic, and Sweeney's account of events seems unassailably well-researched. No flaws, no holes, no varnished truths. A refreshingly honest telling of an indelibly dark spot in British history, told with poise and compassion; without undue sentimentality, but with well-judged contrition."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Altmann", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20969386-rebecca-altmann", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this from start to finish.Part 'The King and I', part 'Sound of Music', part war adventure, part feminist coming of age drama, part war-time romance - it has a little of everything including a good dose of war history about the contrution of the elephant companies that will be unknown to many.When I finished I straight away bought Elephant Bill - recommended by the author in the note at the end. That is a fabulous read and has been used as the basis (inspiration?) for much of novel.It is a shame the the Author's Note is hidden away at the end of the book and that the historical background is not clearly explained at the start. I like to know which parts of historical fiction are history and which are fiction, and having this information upfront would have saved me from wondering the whole way through.I'm glad I found the link and being able to read the primary source material increased my enjoyment of the story."}, {"userName": "Stephen Crabbe", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23405987-stephen-crabbe", "userReview": "Reading this novel was a wonderful experience. The author's supple prose is vivid and fluent, the narrative voice strong and authentic. I immediately liked and empathised with the main character, a young woman, and loved the depth and interest given to several secondary but important characters. Even several elephants, a group forming a central factor in the story, become fascinating characters as the author portrays their different behaviours. The historical period chosen for the tale presents a number of big issues, like the push for liberation from colonialism, the notion of racial differences and inequality, and the horrors of the Second World War. The question looms: Who is the more humane--human or elephant?I was enthralled from beginning to end.

However, this was a bit different, set in Burma, with the Japanese attacking and the Indians not sure which way to turn - should they throw their lot in with the Japanese to overcome colonial rule? The book narrates a tale based on fact, of an escape from Burma to India through the jungles and across the foothills of the Himalayas, in an old bus kindly donated by the British and then on elephants. I warmed to Grace very early on, and loathed Gregory (you couldn't really do anything but!).

The first third of the book is very well written with nice touches of detail in the descriptions. Things seem to have gone wrong in the middle and then completely cracked up in the end.

With Japanese soldiers chasing them down, the group struggles westwards as every day their chances of survival shrink.
