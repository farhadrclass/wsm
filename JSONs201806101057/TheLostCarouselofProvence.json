Now, of course, I must seek out the Parisian carousels that Cady Drake photographs in the present day segments of the story. As Cady begins to unravel the mystery of her own carousel creature, the narrative slips into two other eras with characters that relate in some way to her search. Though I usually dislike alternating time frames and shifting character voices, this time it works quite well. The present, 1944 in Paris, and 1900 in Provence eventually knit together to reveal the answers to Cady\u2019s questions and through the process she copes with her own troubled past and (quelle surprise) finds love.If you like a bit of history, French atmosphere, an odd topic, plus some romance you will no doubt enjoy this pleasant, diverting novel."}, {"userName": "Janette Mcmahon", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5406525-janette-mcmahon", "userReview": "ARC Review. The story line and theme is much like her other books, with the reader easily figuring out the family mystery. The setting is wonderful as are the flawed characters. Idid not like the ending as well as other books, this one did not give a strong \"this is what happened with Cady\" ending. We assume the romance continued along with the restoration. Would recommend to readers familiar with Blackwell along with Montfiore and deRosnay."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4845739-amanda", "userReview": "I received an ARC from a Goodreads giveaway. I really enjoyed this story. It made me want to travel to Paris to explore carousels or at least check out the one in Wisconsin that is a bit more attainable."}], "description": "An artist lost to history, a family abandoned to its secrets, and the woman whose search for meaning unearths it all in a sweeping and expressive story from the \n\nNew York Times \n\nbestselling author of \n\nLetters from Paris\n\n.\nPresent day, San Francisco. During her free time, professional photographer Cady Drake shoots local carousels, a hobby inspired by a gift that transformed her childhood: a wooden rabbit supposedly created by master French carver Gustave Bayol a century ago. And when she's offered a freelance assignment for a book on the antique merry-go-rounds of Paris, Cady can't refuse the opportunity to visit the famous carousels for the first time....1900s, France. In a small town outside of Avignon, a husband and young wife struggle to keep up their ancestral chateau--and start the family they so desperately desire. For the children they hope to have, the Clements hire the famous Bayol to build a carousel, but as the carver and his apprentice work on the beautiful and whimsical creation, fate will entwine them all in unseen ways--for generations to come...Present day, Provence. As Cady's research leads her to the dilapidated Chateau Clement and its fabled carousel that was lost to the ravages of World War II, she will uncover a shocking truth in a set of one-hundred-year-old photographs that could guide her in reuniting a family torn apart by petty jealousies over several generations.", "title": "The Lost Carousel of Provence", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37585026-the-lost-carousel-of-provence", "average": 3.91, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1515512973l/37585026.jpg", "reviews": 3, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2924930.Juliet_Blackwell", "name": "Juliet Blackwell"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Historical", "Cultural", "Adult Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37585026-the-lost-carousel-of-provence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37540109-the-lost-carousel-of-provence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6456016-secondhand-spirits", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7114817-a-cast-off-coven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9660102-hexes-and-hemlines", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7885220-if-walls-could-talk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12608168-in-a-witch-s-wardrobe"]}
