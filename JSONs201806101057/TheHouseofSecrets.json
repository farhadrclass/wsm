About a man found murdered, his body had been frozen and in his chest is a Bible. Not just any Bible -this Bible belonged to Benedict Arnold. She gets three questions a day to try and solve it.Fast forward to present day, Hazel, her older brother Skip and her dad are all in the car together. Her dad is telling the kids that he is thinking about ending his long running show House of Secrets. The show is one of those reality type shows that globe trots on the premise of finding \"Untold Secrets\"...like Bigfoot, Nessie, Conspiracy theories. You know..that stuff that I watch until I stick to my sofa covered in a layer of Cheeto dust.\nCue the suspence now. Dad ends up wrecking the car (NOT A SPOILER WHINY ASSES) and Hazel is in the hospital. She wakes up with the old memory loss thing going. Not all her life is gone..just the memories with any feelings attached.She realizes that she has a weird guy lurking around who just happens to be an FBI guy. Guess what? Old dad was in some stuff. He has been chasing stories around hunting down that very same Bible that Benedict Arnold had. Now folks are dying in that same way, Bible in the chest thing for those with a short attention span. *raises hand*I'm not going to lie. This kinda reads like a Dan Brown adventure, but with a female main character. There is even the creepy guy lurking around the world.\nSometimes in the right company I admit that I like Dan Brown books. Quit judging...Jesus ain't hiring. (I read that somewhere and was dying to use it.)This one was kind of jerky though. I never really got close enough to Hazel's character enough to decide if I truly liked her or not. She might have been bad assed..but who knows? Sometimes she was and then sometimes I wanted someone to hurry up and plunge that knife into her back. She maybe should have left them feelings in the dumpster.\nThen the whole Benedict Arnold thing. boooorring. It finally did try and come together but I had kinda lost interest by then. The book is fast moving in some spots...and then in some spots paint dried faster.\nBooksource: Netgalley in exchange for review."}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "This is an extraordinarily brilliant thriller that is a compulsive page turner. Where to start? As a young child, Hazel was told a odd story by her father, Jack Nash, where inside the body of a dead man, a small bible that was the property of Benedict Arnold is found. Jack has just died in a car crash, in which Hazel has been injured. She is suffering from amnesia, always an excellent condition for a good story, and there is a man from the FBI who has questions which she is in no position to answer. Apparently there is a dead man found in strange circumstances and inside him is a bible that belongs to Benedict Arnold, and her father had recently met him. And now her father is dead, is this a coincidence? Jack Nash is famous as someone who chases down conspiracy theories and was joined by his son, Skip, in the business. Hazel intensively questions Skip in her search to find out exactly who she is and know more about the family. Although she has had nothing to do with the family business, Hazel is determined to find out what is going on. After all, isn't it time she joined the family business? The trail is packed full of mystery, intrigue, suspense, red herrings and twists galore.This is one hell of a thrill ride. It has a fast paced narrative with great characters. As for the story, there were times when I felt my head spin. Fantastic read that comes highly recommended.

To summarize the story, just read the synopsis provided-it does a good job of providing the highlights.What I didn't like:-The Benedict Arnold Bible plot was confusing to me (which is the main focal point of the story unfortunately) -At times the author allowed the reader to get closer to the main character Hazel, only to be snatched back and left wondering...who is she? I found it to be a bit jarring.-I felt a lot of the shenanigans that Hazel got herself into were a bit far fetched for someone with a brain injury and only bits and pieces of her life making sense.What I did like:-Hazel! Or I did like the parts that I was able to get to know. She is a strong protag.-Once the 'Bible\" twist is revealed, things did fall into place nicely. Would have liked more chapters on the 'missions' though.-While some of the plot did come across a bit unrealistic, I have to credit the author with his creativeness as it's nothing that I've ever read before. I enjoyed being surprised.All in all it was a good read that I do recommend. As you will see from other reviews, there are many glowing 5 star reviews, so I am in the minority with my rating.My thanks to Netgalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/351830-alexandra", "userReview": "7/10/16 Kindle version is on sale today for $3.99. I read it and thought it was pretty good.* Review copy provided by NetGalley * A host of a popular TV show about conspiracies and famous mysteries is perhaps mixed up in a conspiracy himself.When Hazel is six years old her father Jack Nash tells her a story. It\u2019s a riddle really, or is it? About a frozen dead man and a bible originally belonging to Benedict Arnold.Hazel wakes up in a hospital with injuries from a car accident. She has issues with her memory, including those about people. She notices there's a man with a gun who stands outside her room. She doesn't know who he is or why he is there. Her brother Skip asks her if she remembers Darren Nixon. She doesn't, and her brother then refuses to enlighten her. \"You brought him up for a reason, Skip. Tell me who Darren Nixon is.\" \"Skip, there's a computer in the waiting room. Plus every nurse on the floor has a phone with a Web browser on it. You can tell me now or I can go out there and look him up myself.\" Then she proceeds to yell at the guy with the gun, who clearly is trying to remain aloof, at least from her. '\"I know you heard me!\" she added, louder than ever. \"I'll keep yelling until someone puts it into Google! Darren Nixon! Darren Nixon! Spelled D-A-R-R-E-N-!\"This is where I found I already liked Hazel. Hazel is an interesting character, and I did really like her. There are big gaps in her memory, which is part of her own personal mystery to solve. She's complex, and not all sunshine and roses.But after coming to in the hospital she realizes there are things going on, mysteries to solve, that have a lot to do with her father. How much does her brother Skip know? She can\u2019t even remember if she trusts Skip, or how she felt about him.The blurb explains the basic plot, so I won\u2019t rehash that. What I will say is I stayed up way too late reading this book because I really wanted to know the answers to the mysteries. It kept me engrossed and interested. It\u2019s a twisty story with some surprises, and people aren\u2019t always what they appear at first.It\u2019s well written and well-paced. I never felt it was dragging.Political thrillers really aren\u2019t my cup of tea, but this book isn\u2019t really a political thriller. It\u2019s definitely in the Suspense/Mystery/Thriller category, but it\u2019s more about a family, a daughter learning her father may have been mixed up in something mysterious and needing to find out what it was and what is going on. A brother who may have secrets of his own.I really enjoyed this one.\u201cJust because something seemed implausible didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t true.\u201dReview copy provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30978160-meredith", "userReview": "4.5 starsThe House of Secrets is a fast-paced thriller that kept me on my toes! It's hard to describe the plot without giving too much away: While on vacation with his daughter, Hazel, and son, Skip, Jack Nash, host of a conspiracy investigation show called \"The House of Secrets\" is killed in a car crash. Post-accident, Hazel wakes up to discover her memories are scrambled. As Hazel works to remember who she was prior to the accident, she also begins investigating her father's death. All is related to Benedict Arnold's bible. As Hazel unravels the mystery of her father, she learns that there were there were greater conspiracies at work than those her father investigated on his show.

The only thing that motivated me to finish this book was my distaste for abandoning books after starting them. I think the problem is this isn't my type of story; I just couldn't make myself care. I could tell there were supposed to be lots of \"AHA! So it was HIM all along!\" moments, but every time that happened I would turn the page and see the book wasn't over yet and go \"oh... there's more. Sigh, ok...\" Two stars because it was a cool concept, but if someone had just described the plot to me and told me all the secrets and plot twists of how it ends, I would have just said \"huh. cool.\" and could have saved myself a bunch of time.

I think I have read most of Brad Meltzer's books. I usually find them to be A-interesting, B-informative, C-exciting, D-fun. I found this one to be E-none of the above. It was mostly kind of stupid, a tired, slightly complicated plot that really didn't keep you interested with so-so characters. As you can tell, I really did not care for this book. I think Meltzer and Goldberg (the co-author) were trying to write something that would compare to Coben or Crais or one of those writers. They didn't get it done."}, {"userName": "Leia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5383189-leia", "userReview": "Hazel's father, Jack, is an international star with a very popular mystery show. However, when Hazel lands up in a car accident, she loses parts of who she was and needs to make those connections again, as well as find out who or what killed her father. Doing so leads her to an underworld of secrets, lies and deception as everything she thought she knew about her family and her life may be wrong.The book starts very well, until the accident and Hazel's subsequent loss of identity. It's not amnesia, but a loss of personal connections to her memories, which first off, was difficult to swallow and understand. It also makes it incredibly hard to really connect with Hazel, which means that the reader really isn't very emotionally invested in the whole story. When things start happening and the mystery starts spinning out, I was kind of going \"meh\", because the \"new\" Hazel wasn't interesting enough to really care about and the traces of the \"old\" Hazel just seemed like a thug with a degree. The mystery itself was fun intellectually, although I wasn't buying the suspense. It basically becomes a follow-the-breadcrumbs-and-get-the-answers plot with very little urgency or threat, and pure curiosity keeping me reading until I finished the book. Which is something, I suppose, since finish it I did.All in all, a pretty mediocre book. Didn't grab me, the characters were very hard to care about and the intrigue is barely enough to make you slog through the rest to solve the mystery of Benedict Arnold's bible. Unsatisfying read, all in all."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "The House of Secrets by Brad Metzler and Tod Goldman is a 2016 Grand Central Publication.\u201cHonor the people who love you.\u201d Jack Nash is a wildly popular television star, hosting a show centered around conspiracy theories. He even got his son, Skip, in on the act. But, his daughter, Hazel, never much cared for that life, and is now a professor. Just as Jack decides he is ready to retire, he and his two adult children are involved in a terrible car accident. Jack dies, while Hazel suffers a peculiar type of memory loss. But, when the FBI shows up asking questions about a dead man with a priceless book, once belonging to the infamous Benedict Arnold, in his chest, wearing a coat belonging to Jack Nash, Hazel knows something is horribly amiss, and begins to believe her father may have been murdered. Hazel sets out to solve the mystery of her father\u2019s death and of her own identity. Who was Jack Nash, really? What secrets did he carry to his grave? I love all the small, intimate details in this story, and the wild, unpredictable characters, set in the shadowy world of government conspiracies. There are so many layers to this story, all them compelling, many of them shocking and horrifying, and thought provoking. The suspense will sneak up behind you, tapping you on the shoulder, and make you squeal out loud. \u201cIt was the people who lived absurdly happy lives, the eternal optimists, who never saw the monster waiting for them under the bed, whereas those with at least a tad of healthy fear admitted the possibility existed.\u201dThe pacing is spot on, as secrets are revealed little by little, always squeezing an audible gasp of shock from me. The plot is intricate, and utterly absorbing, mingled with adventure, action, and drama. Conspiracy theories abound, with diabolical twists, and evil characters, and even a few moral dilemmas, to give you something to chew on. On all fronts this is a spectacular, top notch thriller, and is thoroughly entertaining. But, for me the real zinger, are the characterizations. I loved Hazel. She is one the best female characters to show up within this genre in a long while. She has a dark side to her personality, one that haunts her, while she attempts to squelch those impulses. I loved that inner tug of war, and the psychology behind it. She\u2019s darkly humorous, with sparkling wit, and pitch perfect timing, and had me cheering her on the whole way! She kicks butt without all the clich\u00e9s.Overall, this set up will segue nicely into the sequel, I am sure is coming, hopefully sooner, rather than later. There are still plenty of secrets to uncover and Hazel\u2019s past still has a few locked doors we could explore, so suffice it to say, I will be looking forward to the next book with bated breath. 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Magdalena aka A Bookaholic Swede", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379514-magdalena-aka-a-bookaholic-swede", "userReview": "There are several things that I like about this book. First, the story is great and thrilling to read. Second, the main characters Hazel is a strong competent woman with an interesting past and third, this seems like it will be the first book in a new series and that makes me really happy. Of, course, there are several more things I like about this book, but I really wanted to point out just those three things since a good thriller, with a strong main character and the promise of sequels is perhaps something that will appeal not just to me, but to others. I have only read one book by Brad Meltzer before I read this book and that was The President's Shadow. But, I liked that book very much and getting an opportunity to rad this book made my day. The story sounded intriguing and I loved the cover. I like the twists and turns of the story and I liked that I couldn't figure it all out and the last part of the book was marvelous. Hazel is a wonderful character, and reading about her trying to figure out her past and at the same time figure out what the death of her father has with the death of a man with an object stuffed into his chest was fascinating.

Jack Nash is the star of The House of Secrets, a long-running television program that has him searching for the deepest mysteries from around the world. Nash recounts the most curious of mysteries to Hazel, his six year-old daughter; a dead man who turns up with Benedict Arnold's Bible hidden inside his sternum, sealed with a wax covering. Thirty years later, Jack and Hazel are in a serious automobile accident, leaving him dead and Hazel with severe amnesia. As she tries to piece her life back together, Hazel uses her father's popular television show to bring some sense as to what her father sought to do for so many years and some of the mysteries he uncovered. She finds it more daunting than she thought at first, forcing her into a larger state of confusion than she could have fathomed. When an FBI agent shows up at her hospital bed, Hazel can only wonder if she, or her father, had a major secret that intrigued the government and seeks to spin through her memory to determine what might lie on the other side of the murky shards of her past. As things become a little clearer, Hazel begins to realise that her father was not the man she once thought and the story of the Arnold Bible may have more significance than a fable told at her father's knee. As bodies begin to pile up, with hints that Jack Nash might have had dealings with them, Hazel works to uncover the largest mystery of all; that of her father's life and this television program that brought him such notoriety. What do the pages of this Benedict Arnold Bible mean and how can she keep herself safe as people lurk in the shadows? An interesting turn on Meltzer's conspiracy novels which has the potential of interest to his fans, though at times not as recognizable as his stellar work from the past.While the premise for a strong novel can be found throughout the story, Meltzer's sharp edge seems to have dulled. It is unclear whether Goldberg's addition is the reason or that Meltzer has spent too much time trying to reveal heroes of the world to the next generation. With a cast of interesting characters and a strong female protagonist, Meltzer and Goldberg build much potential for the narrative, though it seems to limp along at places, even in the most riveting historical revelations. The Benedict Arnold idea is brilliant, as is The House of Secrets angle, though I could not find myself as excited or curious as I have been with many of Meltzer's previous novels. One can hope that Meltzer will decide which path he wishes to take, as some adult novelists have been able to juggle writing in both worlds while others dwindle as they try to attract fans across too many genres. Time will tell, though one can hope he need not use co-authors to keep an annual (or bi-annual) release to appease those wanting stimulating literature.Kudos, Messrs. Meltzer and Goldberg for this interesting piece. While I am a harsh critic at times, I know there is much potential with some time and polish. Let's hope readers embrace these historical novels and keep coming back.Like/hate the review?

Highly entertaining! \"The House of Secrets,\" the story of a fictional TV host secretly working for the U.S. government, and a daughter's search to find the truth.As the novel opens  it is LA, thirty years prior. Jack Nash decides it is time for his daughter, Hazel to be told \u201cThe Story.\u201d He was told \u201cThe Story\u201d at age six, and Hazel, is now the same. He feels it is the appropriate time. His son, Skip was five. The Story had not stuck. Jack wonders how old you have to be to retain an event for the rest of your life. He begins The Story, slipping into The Voice. The same one his dad used, and the one Jack now uses on his TV show, (host of The House of Secrets), where every week he explores the world\u2019s most famous conspiracies. Of course, Hazel is not allowed to watch. His wife thinks it will give her bad dreams. The story begins  a hundred and fifty years ago. The farmer finds a young man on the ground frozen to death. When the doctor arrives he takes him back to his office and performs an autopsy. Inside the chest, he finds a small object the size of a deck of cards. Encased in sealing wax. Inside he finds a miniature book. A Bible. Inside the Bible he sees four handwritten words: \u201cProperty of Benedict Arnold.\u201d The only thing is that there was no scar on his chest or his body, so how did it get there?Of course Hazel does not know the name. He explains he was a complicated solider during the Revolutionary War. How did it get there? A mystery. A mystery to be solved. She receives three guesses per night. Magic? Impossible? Or Someone trying to fool you?Fast forward 200 years  from the original farmer story and you have the family of Jack Nash, the host of a TV Show \"The House of Secrets\". Jack and his son Skip travel the world trying to solve mysteries and uncovering secrets. Jack has three rules.  1) There was a rub in every deal\u2014a snag or drawback; always a catch. Once you understood that, there were no bad deals 2) Nothing goes missing. Everything is somewhere. 3) Honor the people who love you.Years later,  Jack\u2019s wife, Claire has been gone for ten years. Brain cancer. He is ending his TV show, to enjoy his time left. Hazel had the same temper as Claire\u2014and the same reckless attraction to destruction.People weren\u2019t happy  unless they believed at least part of the world was some grand hoax. It\u2019s what made Watergate so compelling. Everything everyone suspected was true. Government was corrupt, the world was being manipulated, nothing was on the level.Jack knows most times  mysteries did not have satisfying endings. Like the death of JFK. No one wanted to believe Oswald acted alone, because then that story was done. The world was different now. He cannot be happy until he finds the book. The Bible. The last mystery. Traveling through Utah,  Jack suffers a heart attack. A car crash. Skip will be OK, Hazel injured. Eight days later in LA, Hazel wakes up from a coma. Jack is gone; however, Hazel cannot remember the details. She has severe brain injuries, leaving her without memories from the past. An FBI shows up,  asking questions about her dad and the corpse of a man found with the object in his chest. Did her father kill this man named Nixon? Hazel remembers The Bible. She recalls hearing the story. Mysteries need to be solved. A dead body and something hidden. Some details were clear and others lost. She thinks her dad told her. The last mystery. Skip is confused, not knowing about the Bible. He often helped his dad chase leads, while investigating conspiracies.Hazel begins trying  to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Who killed this man and how in the heck did he get the book in his chest? She could not believe anything she was hearing. How could she have woken up from a coma to find herself in this life? She had tried to remember any hint of a secret life of her father. Was she a part of this too?The FBI says  her father made a personal visit to this guy the week before the accident. The guys loved Jack\u2019s show. A secret obsession he hid from his family? The guy died and Jack died three days later. Poison was found. Meanwhile, we hear from a mysterious man known as the Bear travels to Dubai to kill a man named Kennedy, and the body of another man named Nixon is found in Canada.In Canada a man in a revolutionary war style jacket has been found dead and inside his chest is a small Bible. In Dubai a man is found dead wearing a red revolutionary war jacket also with a Bible in his chest. Why would a father train his six-year-old daughter. He wanted her to stay away from silly tricks, leave the family business behind. Give her a chance a freedom, not to be trapped. Whoever killed Arthur Kennedy and Darren Nixon wanted her to know. Where they looking for the Bible, or something else? What were Jack, Kennedy, and Nixon looking for? Was Jack working for the government? What was behind his conspiracy show? As Hazel, an anthropology professor tries to recover her memory and find out why she, has a lot of guns, and scars---she continues to try and solve the mystery of her father. Hazel is full of secrets! What is the truth? Who can be trusted? She has to solve the mystery in order to find herself. A secret worth killing for.  Every turn of events is really a conspiracy in disguise with a bit of truthiness. Truth often is stranger than fiction. George Washington and Benedict Arnold (Chapter 85 A Theory) Betrayal? or Not? Awesome research . . . . What a wild ride!  Hazel\u2019s journey is intriguing, mysterious, and suspenseful. Edge of your seat --From twists, turns, no one does conspiracy better than Brad Meltzer. Shocking modern conspiracy theories often turn out true after thorough investigation by our society. To many, conspiracy theories are just human nature.

At least, until the family business chose her\u2026While speeding through Utah, Jack Nash, Hazel\u2019s father, suffers a heart attack. Falling unconscious, he loses control and the car crashes. Hazel, who was riding shotgun next to her dad, was seriously injured. Her brother, Skip, was in the backseat and walked away mostly okay.Eight days later, Hazel woke up in the hospital after being in a coma. Confused and groggy, she found her brother at her side. Their father was dead and Hazel, who can\u2019t remember certain details or feel much emotion, is told that she suffered a serious head injury.Her memory may return over time, but there\u2019s no guarantee. It\u2019s not full amnesia, though, as she does have certain memories like, for instance, being told as a young child that \u201cnothing is ever lost\u2026everything is always somewhere.\u201d It was her father who told her that, and he also taught her to question things and search for answers. In fact, that\u2019s how Jack Nash made a living.Having spent four decades on television as host of The House of Secrets, a popular conspiracy show, Jack Nash was a famous man. So too is Skip, his son, who eventually started co-hosting the show. Together they traveled the world, chasing leads and investigating crazy conspiracies. Hazel, though, lived her life away from the limelight.That\u2019s not to say that she didn\u2019t enjoy a good mystery, though. In fact, one of her most vivid memories, even after the car accident, is a story her father told her when she was just a young child. It was about a man being found dead with Benedict Arnold\u2019s bible in his chest. The object, no bigger than a deck of cards, was found during the man\u2019s autopsy. The question is, how did the bible get there?Hazel never did figure it out.While still in the hospital peppering her brother with questions about who she is, who he is, who their father was (their mother died many years before) and what their life is like, she spotted a suspicious-looking man in the hallway. It turns out that the man is an agent with the FBI, and he was there to speak with Hazel.Though her memory is spotty, Hazel answers the FBI man\u2019s questions as best as she can. Skip is there too, and together they listen as they\u2019re told about a body that was recently found. The dead man was cold like he\u2019d been in a freezer, but that wasn\u2019t even the strangest thing about it. Upon further inspection, medical examiners found a copy of Benedict Arnold\u2019s bible in his chest cavity.Then came another bombshell\u2026The last known person the dead man had been in contact with was Jack Nash. The two had met in person just a few days prior. Now both men are dead. Is the mystery man\u2019s death a coincidence, or is it somehow linked to Jack? Something stinks, and it ain\u2019t just the nasty hospital gowns.Hazel goes looking for answers but the more she learns about herself, the less she likes who she used to be. Plus, there\u2019s another blistering conspiracy lurking behind the scenes, and it\u2019s up to Hazel Nash to expose the truth. To do that she has to find out who she is, and who her father really was.The House of Secrets packs a brilliant mystery into a hair-raising conspiracy that will leave readers on the edge of their seats. Fast pacing, nonstop suspense, and a climactic final act make this one of the summer\u2019s best novels.WHY I LOVED ITI\u2019m just going to admit it, I love a good conspiracy. Did we really land on the moon? Did the government recover an alien spaceship in Roswell, New Mexico? And what about the Georgia Guide Stones\u2013who built them and what\u2019s their intended purpose?As humans, we\u2019re drawn to conspiracies because many times, well, they\u2019re more exciting than the truth. We like to be entertained, it\u2019s just a fact. Meltzer understands this better than most and knows just how to hold a reader\u2019s attention as he lays the story\u2019s foundation. He also knows how to keep readers off-balance and guessing, incorporating twists and turns as the story unfolds.We don\u2019t know Hazel before the car accident that left her brain scrambled, which means we\u2019re getting to know her at the same time she\u2019s getting to know herself. The suspense mixed with historical fiction really works, and makes for a compelling plot that\u2019s unique and exactly what fans of Meltzer\u2019s books have come to expect.Bonus: If you\u2019ve read Meltzer\u2019s Beecher White series, you\u2019ll recognize a character who makes a small cameo in The Hosue of Secrets. It\u2019s pretty awesome! WHY YOU SHOULD READ ITNobody writes quite like Brad Meltzer. His style is sort of like if Harlan Coben\u2019s books had a love child with one of Steve Berry\u2019s novels. Informative, yet full of twists and things you never saw coming. Oh, and nearly impossible to put down!If you\u2019re a fan of Meltzer\u2019s television show Brad Meltzer\u2019s Decoded which in many ways is the real-life version of the fictitious \u201cThe House of Secrets\u201d that Hazel\u2019s father hosted, then you have to read this book.If there\u2019s anything negative to say, my only gripe is that Meltzer goes through stretches of writing in very short sentences, which at times made me feel like I was living inside of Aaron Sorkin\u2019s brain. There\u2019s lots of ping-pong dialogue, and while it reads fast, it also feels a little choppy at times. Not a huge problem, but it does take a little getting used to.All in all, The House of Secrets is a fun, solid thriller that is sure to leave you questioning everything\u2013including the history books!BOOK DETAILS Author: Brad MeltzerPages: 352 (Hardcover)Publisher: Grand Central PublishingRelease Date: June 7, 2016 (Order Now!)"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9293405-heather", "userReview": "I received an ARC copy of this book free through Goodread's Giveaways.I'm always up for a good murder mystery/psychological thriller and this one did not disappoint. I was hooked from the first chapter. The idea of being in an accident that causes amnesia due to a brain injury that causes you to lose emotion is such a scary idea. That combined with your father's death and a string of strange murders and having no idea who you were in the past would be more than enough to push someone over the edge of sanity. Instead the main character, Hazel becomes determined to dig into her past and put all the pieces together.This is the first of Brad Meltzer's books that I have read and I'm pleased I gave it a try. I always try to solve the mystery but this one kept me guessing until the end. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."}, {"userName": "Rick Andrews", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28937138-rick-andrews", "userReview": "Thanks to Goodreads for this giveaway.....The reviews for this \"thriller\" were almost all very favorable, so I was really looking forward to a great read., Maybe it's just me, but I hated it.

The biggest drawback for me was that I felt left with way too many unanswered questions. I also liked the history about Benedict Arnold and the \"tongue in cheek\" description of Jack's TV show. I've seen some recently much like \"The House of Secrets\"...which was Jack & Skip Nash's TV show where they try to prove or debunk historical myths/legends. Overall it was a good read. The story meshed well and was easy to follow. The book will not only appeal to mystery fans but history buffs as well."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56704-ashley", "userReview": "I wanted to love this book as much as I loved all the books in Meltzer's Culper Ring series and yet, I just couldn't. The House of Secrets didn't work for me on a bunch of different levels. For one thing, Hazel's injury added to the plot's complexity but I found it pretty difficult to understand or believe. While he's clear that she's not suffering from amnesia, it sure functions that way in the book a lot of the time. Second, I felt like the characters weren't nearly as developed as they were in his other books. Third, the characterization of Hazel's friend Butchie bordered on the stereotypical (a whole lot of his sentences started with \"girl, blah blah blah\"). Finally, after a ton of build-up, the plot is resolved so quickly that the whole thing just feels unbelievable. The parts of the book I enjoyed most were when Meltzer was on familiar ground. When the FBI agent in the book heads to the National Archives (and Beecher White shows up) it felt like the plot both got going and felt more coherent. It's clear Meltzer knows how to write those scenes whereas the others didn't work nearly as well.I will probably not keep reading the books in this series."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13431039-sarah", "userReview": "Thanks to Goodreads and the publisher for a free copy!This book, okay? This book has the absolute greatest first chapter that I have ever read. I made an audible gasp and forced everyone around me to read it as well. It is amazing, and I'm currently torn between gushing about it and a general feeling that maybe I shouldn't spoil anything.The rest of the book is a fantastic, gripping read as well. It gets into amnesia (always a fun thing to explore), TV shows about historical artifacts and conspiracies (where the author's expertise shines through), and good old espionage and government corruption. I loved the characters, I loved the ethical issues that they raised, and I loved the twists and turns the plot took.

It's got hidden history, amnesia angst, super-spies and sleeper agents, and a villain who will stop at nothing.

This book is a little different from the others. It is more of a psychological thriller with a woman, Hazel Nash, as the main character. She is no Beecher White, one of my favorite characters, but she has her own unique personality. A personality she has to dig out from within herself ever since the accident when her brain was injured. Is it true that the size of our amygdala can determine our personalities or predict certain behaviors? Do creased ear lobes lead to over-sized hearts that could explode in our bodies? Scientific anomalies such as these are included in the story. They make me wonder and think. And that's what a book is supposed to do.The action in the first half of the book is a little slow. We learn the back story of Hazel and her brother. Her father's visits to volatile countries confuse Hazel. She sees that she has traveled to similar countries. While Hazel is a professor, her brother, Skip, follows in his father's footsteps on TV. He loves the attention and announces everything he does on social media. But is he so silly?Soon we learn that everyone has ulterior motives. And whomever I suspect becomes a suspect at one time in the story until the facts bring Hazel her answers. She is able to remember people and events but not her feelings relating to them. She is on a journey to find herself and who killed her father. A conspiracy theory comes into play with Benedict Arnold and George Washington. It wouldn't be a Brad Meltzer book without it. The book is fun to read. It plays out nicely.Did Brad Meltzer need a co-author? James Patterson might but not Brad Meltzer. But his work always comes out gold in the end."}, {"userName": "Thomas Bruso", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27589000-thomas-bruso", "userReview": "Brad Meltzer\u2019s latest thriller, \u201cThe House of Secrets,\u201d explores a long-ago mystery involving a leather book belonging to Benedict Arnold.Hazel enters into an all too real nightmare when, at the age of 6, she hears a tall tale from her father, Jack Nash, the host of America\u2019s favorite conspiracy TV show, \"The House of Secrets,\" about the mystery of a bible hidden in a corpse.Years later, Hazel wakes up in a hospital bed at UCLA Medical Center bruised and incoherent, with a brain injury from a car accident she was in with her brother Skip and father, Jack. Hazel cannot remember anything from that life-altering day, not even her own name.As she tries to piece the puzzle together, a mysterious man from the FBI arrives at the hospital, asking her questions about her father.

When Hazel Nash was six years old, her father taught her: mysteries need to be solved. He should know. Hazel's father is Jack Nash, the host of America's favorite conspiracy TV show, The House of Secrets. Even as a child, she loved hearing her dad's tall tales, especially the one about a leather book belonging to Benedict Arnold that was hidden in a corpse.Now, years later, Hazel wakes up in the hospital and remembers nothing, not even her own name. She's told she's been in a car accident that killed her father and injured her brother. But she can't remember any of it, because of her own traumatic brain injury. Then a man from the FBI shows up, asking questions about her dad-and about his connection to the corpse of a man found with an object stuffed into his chest: a priceless book that belonged to Benedict Arnold. Back at her house, Hazel finds guns that she doesn't remember owning. On her forehead, she sees scars from fights she can't recall. Most important, the more Hazel digs, the less she likes the person she seems to have been. Trying to put together the puzzle pieces of her past and present, Hazel Nash needs to figure out who killed this man-and how the book wound up in his chest. The answer will tell her the truth about her father, what he was really doing for the government-and who Hazel really is. Mysteries need to be solved.
