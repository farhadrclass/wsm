BUT - if you hated The Night Circus, don't run off just yet, because this is both better-written and much darker. BUT - those of you who are turned off by me saying \"much darker\" should know it's not too dark. there, i think i've sufficiently confused everyone. (oh, i just noticed katherine dunn blurbed this. that's pretty perfect.) this is a book for people who like books about books, sideshows, family sagas with a little magic in 'em, and strong supportive boys covered in tentacle tattoos.there's a magical element to the story, but it doesn't overshadow what is at its heart a melancholy and beautiful story of a family's sufferings across generations. half of the book is the story of simon watson, a sweet and hapless librarian who is going through the roughest of rough patches. he loses his job, the family home, where he has lived alone for years in a nostalgic haze, is sliding ever-closer to the edge of a cliff overlooking the long island sound, he has just clumsily initiated a more intimate relationship with a woman he has known since childhood, his whirlwind of a sister enola has breezed back into town - scrawny, emotional, and trailing a heavily tattooed fella, and he has received a very curious book in the mail which is about to change his life. the book is a log from a traveling carnival dating back to the 1700's, and simon discovers that it contains information about his ancestors, which calls his attention to a freaky coincidence: generations of circus mermaids* related along the female line all died by drowning on july 24th. which is the date his mother, a former circus mermaid, also drowned when he was a child. both simon and enola were taught the breath-holding techniques of the mermaid by their mother, but while enola has followed her mother's path into a carnival career, she deals strictly in tarot. however, july 24th is only six weeks away, and patterns are starting to emerge in the book that are manifesting around him, causing simon to worry very seriously for enola. alternating with simon's narrative is the fleshed-out story from the log, which documents the travels of peabody's; the traveling carnival where simon and enola's ancestors, amos and evangeline, meet and initiate the cycle that will affect subsequent generations. it's rare for me, in split-narrative books, to be equally invested in both stories. usually there is one i am more drawn to, while the other becomes something i read in order to get back to the \"real\" story. but this time, i was just as engrossed in the amos/evangeline story as the simon one. and i took such delight in the details that crossed over from one story to the other; the lockpicking, the tarot cards, the horseshoe crabs, etc. which, never have horseshoe crabs been so ... sinister.oh, and did i mention this was illustrated? because it is. not heavily, which would be distracting, but appropriately. and squeeee - this ARC came with a cool little mini-book about the making of the hand-bound, gilded manuscripts on tea-stained paper that were sent to book publishers in September 2013. which is the way to go when trying to get a book deal. and i want one of THOSE, please:\n\nbut for those of you who do not have an ARC, or are reading this in the future when the book is already out, (hi!! what is the future like?? are there any new animals??) don't be jealous!! just click this link!it's a very strong debut, and honestly - knowing that this woman hand-bound ornate manuscripts to circulate to publishers makes me very willing to support her in all her endeavors, because that's the kind of craftiness (in both meanings) i can enthusiastically applaud. plus, the book is really good, so there's that.i am looking forward to reading other reviews of this, so read it!* which are not mermaids like this:which it what i was thinking of (minus the bull) when i read the back of this book and thought \"hmmmm - sounds silly\" but are \"mermaids\" in the sense that they can hold their breath for a really long time and swim around sexily underwater in clingy white dresses for the delight of leering menfolk.which is not silly, just kind of sad. like so many elements of the carnival."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "I fell asleep at my desk, having spent the last day teaching myself about curses and searching for Ryzhkova. The National Archives were lacking in ship manifests pre-1800, but allowed me to track bibliographies that led to the New York Public Library\u2019s archives and manifests from 1600 on...\nThis is a book about a whiny narrator doing research. And also about tarot cards.The Book of Speculation is a strange novel and, really, that's its greatest merit. Many different - flat and lifeless - characters have their own weird stories overlapping in this book and behind it all is the story of Simon Watson's family and the curse that may take the lives of all its women.The book seems to promise dark family secrets, books, carnivals and magic - a blend which sounds like paradise for most readers. In truth, though, it was very slow and dull. It's one of those stories that is strongest in the very beginning when setting up the mystery; it propels the reader along by a need to discover the answers and nothing more.The middle section of the book (about 80% of it) should have been made up of compelling drama, excitement, interesting discoveries and fascinating flashbacks to the past. Instead, it's about the boring character of Simon Watson - stealing books from the library and conducting tedious research into why the women of his family might be cursed to die on July 24.The flashback - or, more accurately, the book Simon receives - starts off in a more interesting way. It features the story of two young lovers who are also carnival acts - Amos is a former wild boy and now reads tarot cards, Evangeline is a \"mermaid\" because she can hold her breath for a long time. My favourite bit (indeed, the only part I really liked) was the start of Amos's story as a mute boy from the wilderness, taken in and given a home at the carnival. But eventually this became as tedious as the present day story. There is something a little fascinating about tarot cards, but this book drained every bit of excitement out of them. From endless mentions of cards and card-reading, to Amos using the cards to communicate with Evangeline, I just grew so tired of the book's plotlessness and boring conversations.The Book of Speculation is being compared to two other popular books - The Night Circus and Water for Elephants. I haven't read the first, but I would say the latter is far more engaging than this book. Gruen's writing has an easy flow to it that Swyler lacks. It was so very easy for me to put this book aside every few minutes.In my opinion, there are far better \"books about books\" - The Shadow of the Wind, The Thirteenth Tale and The Storied Life of A.J.

Modern day and a setting in the 1700's. Simon is our present day main character. A lonely research librarian that lives in his family home due to the fact that he can't bare to leave it. His mother walked into the water one day and killed herself and his father grieved himself to death. Simon raised his younger sister Enola and then she left. Simon's family is a special family. All the women in it have been able to hold their breath for long periods of time but they all have died at an early age. From drowning.\nSimon receives a book from a collector that unlocks links to his families past. He becomes obsessed with breaking the curse of the mermaids (carnival mermaids) that haunts his family.Then you have the rest of the story. Amos was the \"wild boy\" in a carnival. He then was trained in reading the cards even though he is mute. He falls in love with Evangeline, who shows up at the show one day distraught with a special gift of being able to hold her breath under water. \nThe stories weave themselves together and then for me just flop.

With a slight border into the fantasy realm, this tale is well-woven and provides an opportunity to feel the impact the past has across a family's descendants and relationships. The book alternates chapters weaving the past and the present together while challenging the reader to determine the connection between the two stories. \nStory\nIn the past, a traveling carnival and circus heads up and down the Eastern seaboard in the mid 18th century lead by the incomparable Peabody. Along the way, he takes in stray who become part of his acts and his own life. When he's forced to choose between some of the older members and the newer finds, disaster strikes causing a flood of impacts for the future.In the present, Simon Watson, receives a book from a mysterious bookseller in Iowa. Simon's Long Island shore house is crumbling and he loses his job as a librarian in difficult economic times. His wayward carnie sister comes home resembling their late mother. His childhood friend becomes his lover. He begins to make connections between the people in the book he receives with his own family but doesn't understand what it means. All the women are tied together on a certain date under certain weather conditions.The two stories collide in a powerful realization leaving Simon at the center of preventing the same fate from happening to his sister. In the end, everything he knew about his life is turned upside down and he finds himself a tragic hero. But will he sacrifice himself in order to preserve his family?\nStrengths\nThe imagery is stunning. The intensity of the relationships is beautiful. The connections among the characters are vast. It's a very simple story but it's a very complex fall-out. The author hits the art form right in its center, providing a wonderfully tragic tale full of intrigue, suspense and drama. You never know who to root for, but you want them all to survive the impacts. It's one of the only books where I didn't need to care so much about specific characters as I did for the way they all relate to one another. It's about relationships and trust, love and power.\nSuggestions\nI generally am not a huge fantasy fan, but when I read fantasy, I want it to go all out, e.g. Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings... this book crosses a very fine line of not actually having any fantasy in it, but the underlying arc that drives the connection feels like it has fantastical elements at its core. I would have liked to see that explored more so it had a very clear purpose in the end (don't want to give away spoilers). A little too much is left to interpretation on what really happened, and why it's happening... which is OK, I like the unknown magic aspects, but given this was such a strong and powerful story, I wanted a little more depth to the core of \"why.\"\nFinal Thoughts\nI like the author's style and would want to read more from her. I'm curious to see what others think of this debut novel. It has so many great components and images, it's bound to be a success. At the same time, it was missing that final piece to push it over the edge and gain immense popularity. The title, \"The Book of Speculation\" could have been explored more and it would have knocked it out of the park for me."}, {"userName": "Darth J ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18974711-darth-j", "userReview": "Average Rating:\n 3 Stars\u2022Past Chapters: 4 Stars\u2022Present Chapters: 2 starsI felt like this book was a gyp. The blurb oversold this as more interesting than it actually was. The \"mermaids\" here are not the kind that transform and have a fish tail, they are just mundane people who can hold their breath. Ugh. I get that this is magical realism and everything, but that just feels cheap.The most interesting story takes place in the past and involves a fortune teller. This is the backbone of the book and the only part that's entertaining, TBH.The chapters that take place in the present are so heavily weighed down with melancholy that I started hating when the story would shift back into today. It's really just awful and depressing, and weirdly romanticizes suicide by drowning. I know it's gross, but I started referring to this as the Book of Speculums. Sorry guys, but this wasn't the book for me. Like a scammy fortune teller, The Book of Speculation pulls you in with an interesting premise but fails to live up to the hype it as created for itself."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30940542-mandy", "userReview": "Wow.... Wow... Wow... This book was simply amazing. I'm not usually drawn to books of this nature but I thrive on how the author uses one book, a book that began with one man who ran a carnival with 3 people in it that change the course of the characters lives.

Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature:Simon Watson, a librarian, is unexpectedly gifted with a mysterious old book out of the blue, from a man he\u2019s never met: a badly damaged record from a traveling circus. In another unanticipated development in his life, Simon enters into a romantic relationship with his longtime friend and next-door neighbor, Alice, though for now they\u2019re keeping it secret from their co-workers and her parents. Unfortunately everything else in Simon\u2019s life is crumbling: his career, as he\u2019s laid off from his job at the library; his house on the edge of a bluff, which is in danger of sliding into Long Island Sound; his relationship with his only living family member, his younger sister Enola, who ran off to join the circus six years earlier. Worse yet, as Simon begins to research and explore the old book sent to him by a collector because it has one of his ancestors\u2019 names in it, he realizes that the women in his family, who have uncanny abilities to stay underwater (working as a \u201cmermaid\u201d in a circus or carnival is a popular family occupation) always drown on July 24. Enola suddenly gets back in touch to let him know that she\u2019s coming home to visit \u2026 and July 24 is only days away.Erica Swyler alternates chapters telling Simon\u2019s story with chapters telling a related story from the past, about Amos, a mute young man who was abandoned by his family as a young boy and is taken in by the proprietor of a traveling carnival. Amos initially acts as a \u201cWild Man\u201d in the carnival\u2019s freak show, showcasing his ability to literally vanish and reappear before the spectators\u2019 eyes. As he grows older, Madame Ryzhkova, the fortune teller, adopts Amos as her apprentice, teaching him the secrets of the tarot cards. All goes well, until one stormy night an ethereal girl, whose skin shimmers as if made of water, wanders into their midst and joins the group, and Amos instantly falls in love. Madame Ryzkova is certain the girl, Evangeline, is a Rusalka (water nymph or mermaid), but Amos is deaf to her entreaties to leave Evangeline alone.As Simon gradually finds out more about his family history, the themes and items from the past and current day become more and more intertwined: circuses with power-filled tarot cards and mermaids. Ominous horseshoe crab invasions. Love fraught with tension. Betrayal. Curses.The main characters in the present day story, Simon and his sister Enola (whose temperament and dangerous fate echo the WWII bomber Enola Gay), are so flawed that they end up not being particularly likable. Simon seems to be compelled to take actions that are self-defeating. Amos and Evangeline are more appealing and interesting, though they each have a tragic streak that tends to tip over into fatalism.Erika Swyler weaves together several intriguing elements in The Book of Speculation, with some enchanting magical realism touches: tarot cards really work, as do curses. Several characters have rather subtle magical abilities, like Amos\u2019 ability to gradually vanish, Enola\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s electric touch, or the ability to hold one\u2019s breath for ten minutes or more, at least if you have some Rusalka blood.Tarot cards are a recurring device used to move the plot along. It will help your enjoyment of this book if you\u2019re familiar with tarot cards and find them entrancing; but their frequent use failed to resonate with me, though it might appeal more to other readers.The fantastical elements, though I appreciated them, didn\u2019t seem fully integrated into the story. The theme of the titular Book of Speculation remains rather obscure, lacking the impact that it should have had. The Book of Speculation is a rather gloomy and slow-paced novel, and in the end it just didn\u2019t all quite come together for me. It was mildly enjoyable, but personally I think it suffers somewhat in comparison to The Night Circus."}, {"userName": "Eilonwy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17237503-eilonwy", "userReview": "3-1/2 stars, rounded up. I do appreciate the weirdness of this story. This book consists of two stories, one present and one past. In the present, Simon is paralyzed with loss. His mother committed suicide when he was seven, his father died ten years later, and his younger sister has left home to be a fortune-teller in a traveling carnival. Lost and lonely, with no direction or desires, Simon moulders away by himself in a house that is falling apart around him. Then a far-off bookseller sends him a mysterious book -- a collection of accounts and sketches covering 200 years -- because Simon's grandmother is mentioned in it. In the past, a mute boy named Amos is taken in by a traveling circus as a Wild Boy who can disappear into his surroundings. He learns to read the Tarot from his mentor, Madame Ryzhkova, and falls in love with Evangeline, a beautiful \"mermaid\" who can hold her breath for many minutes, greatly impressing the crowds. A curse seems to have followed Simon's maternal family down the centuries, and seems to be connected to the book he's been sent -- a book which mentions Amos and Madame Ryzhkova. Can he determine the source of the curse, and end it before tragedy occurs again?Half of me loved this book. The past story was engaging, with interesting characters and an other-worldly, mystical feel. It made me want to learn to read Tarot cards, and normally I'm not a person who even believes in them, which is a testament to how convincing and integral to the story the author made the fortune-telling seem. I felt deeply for Amos and Evangeline. Madame Ryzhkova's possessiveness and spitefulness rang true. And I wanted to give treats to Sugar Nip, the tiny horse Amos bonds with. These characters were alive and felt real, and are what kept me reading this book. The other half of me was bored and a little frustrated. Simon is a pretty dull guy, frozen and unable to enjoy anything, and while I understood and empathized with why he is that way, I grew less and less enthusiastic about spending time with him as his story went on. And on. Despite trying to set up some high stakes, this part of the book lacked the tension and power of the past. No one in these segments is happy, ever, and that dreariness started getting to me as I cared less and less about what happened to these people. The main thing that kept me going was that I imagined Mr. Churchwarry, the mysterious bookseller, as looking like Joel Grey's character on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and I was hoping he'd turn out to be that interesting (and he comes close). Just when I was about to give this book the 2-1/2 star kiss of meh, the last few present chapters finally got tense in a good way, pulled a twist I maybe should have seen coming but didn't, and then ended on a glowing, positive, actually cheerful note that won another star and got me to round my rating up instead of down. The writing is gorgeous, lush and poetic. I just wish the present story had felt more like it deserved such writing. But overall, this was an intriguing, fairly quick read for me, and I'm glad I was excited enough by Kelly's review to give this book a chance."}, {"userName": "Carole (Carole's Random Life in Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5892196-carole-carole-s-random-life-in-books", "userReview": "This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life.2 StarsI am not really sure what I expected from this book but I finished it feeling rather disappointed and completely underwhelmed. The story never quite pulled me in even though there were some sections that did catch my attention. In the end, this is one of those books that I will probably forget quickly. It wasn't a book that I hated but I didn't really like it either. This book is told in alternating timelines which I admit that I am not a fan of. In the present time, Simon is a young librarian who receives a book that is believed to contain information regarding his family. Simon spends much of his free time researching the book and trying to figure out a way to save his house which is about to fall into the ocean. The past focuses on Amos, a mute child, who starts out being abandoned by his family and must fend for himself in the woods. He stumbles upon a traveling circus and soon becomes a vital member of the group as he grows into adulthood. One of the problems that I had with this book is that anytime something would become interesting in either timeline the book would immediately switch to the other period of time. The two time periods were not as connected as I had hoped they would be which really interrupted the flow in my reading. The pacing of the story felt really off and there just wasn't enough going on during a large part of the story.The characters in this story felt flat and I had a hard time connecting with any of them. With the exception of Enola and Doyle, the characters in the present time are B-O-R-I-N-G. The characters in the past were more interesting but only slightly so. The only characters that I actually liked in this book were Amos and Doyle. Doyle's role in the story is rather minor but he was my favorite character in the book. I thought Amos was interesting especially in the scenes before he joins the circus. There were parts of the book that I felt were stronger than others. I thought that the conclusion to the story was well done. This is not a feel good story and I found much of the book to be rather depressing. I would not recommend this book but I can see what some people may see in this book. I think that this just wasn't the right book for me.

On the one hand the characters never really grabbed me and a few of them actually antagonised me (Enola especially). Simon, the main character, is basically hopeless and helpless. On the other hand the story is original and I thought it was paced really well. I found it hard to put down and ended up staying up late to finish it. The ending is particularly clever with a nice little twist that I did not see coming. Take no notice of all the silly rubbish about it being like either The Night Circus or Water for Elephants.

That was the primary reason I decided to pick this book up.However I failed to connect with any of the characters, not for lack of trying. They do have very interesting and well developed backgrounds, but all seemed to have a similar sad story. But that wasn't the reason I couldn't connect. The real reason was I found pretty much all of the characters pretty selfish, and had a hard time connecting because of it. I think if that had happened, if I had cared what happened to Simon's sister Enoula, or Evangeline then perhaps I could have enjoyed the events more. But I didn't and I couldn't.

Struggling with his recent redundancy, the inevitable crumbling of his family home into the sea, and the return of his sister, Simon develops an obsession with the book which reveals a troubling history. For generations, the women of his family, all with a talent for holding their breath, including his mother, have drowned on the same date.Dual narratives reveal Simon's growing concern for his fragile sister as July 24th approaches, and the truth of the tragic curse that has haunted their family since the early 1800's beginning with Evangeline, 'The Atlantis Mermaid'. Similar themes are reflected in both tales - lust, guilt, love, betrayal, loss, and magic, and tangible connections are drawn with a tattered deck of tarot cards and the appearance of horseshoe crabs.\"At the corner of a page, just above a quickly jotted note about oppressive heat and fog, is a delicate brown illustration of a horseshoe crab. I shut the book and leave the house as quickly as my ankle allows. I need to get into the water, to clear my head....On the sand, crabs scramble around my feet and over each other. The tide has come up since the afternoon, hiding the thousands more horseshoes that lurk beneath.\"I loved reading about Peabody's spectacular traveling carnival. The characters of The Wild Boy, the Seer, the Mermaid and Peabody himself are vividly drawn, their dark secrets are haunting and tragic.\"Heralded by a glorious voice, a troupe of traveling entertainers arrived. A mismatched collection of jugglers, acrobats, fortune-tellers, contortionists, and animals, the band was presided over by Hermelius H. Peabody, self-proclaimed visionary in entertainment and education, who thought the performers and animals (a counting pig deemed learned, a horse of miniature proportions, and a spitting llama) were instruments for improving minds and fattening his purse.\"The pace of the novel is measured, reflecting the melancholic, often close, atmosphere of the novel. The tension builds slowly in both timelines, as the truth of the curse is unraveled. The prose is often beautiful and enhanced by the illustrations that accompany it.The Book of Speculation an enchanting tale.\"She knows that her name will find its way into his speculations.

On the one hand, I gnerally hate books about the circus. I also find that most \"literary\" authors are rubbish at writing the fantastic. On the other, maybe mermaids? A family curse? Mysterious book? I did like \"The Night Circus\". Maybe this is another unexpected treasure?No. It was not. The language was utterly precious. And the protagonist, either utterly unbelievable or someone who needed a good punch in the face. He's a male librarian and he's so sensitive that he can remember what it was like to have eggshells under his fingernails when he ate breakfast on the morning that his mother drowned. More than 20 years ago. When he was an elementary school aged child. OMG. Simon is the saddest sack that ever sacked. When methamphetamine would improve your lead character's personality, it's time to think again about what you're writing. Some female writers can write male characters that \"feel\" male.

Carnivals seem to be popular in literary circles this year -- The Book of Speculation is the second novel I've read in the span of a month that incorporates elements of carnival life. Of course, carnivals have a long history of appearing in fiction. The strangeness of the lifestyle fascinates and allows for the exploration of both the extreme and mundane in human experience without having to hew to the strictures demanded by literary realism. Whether such tales are infused with speculative or magical elements or not, the triumphs and tragedies of characters who live life outside of the mainstream, in insular tribes, are fraught with intensity born of being both foreign (to most of us) and yet familiar. Carnival folk, in their nomadic and arcane ways, are odd, but are reassuringly familial -- whether biologically related or not -- which allows us a sense that their lives echo and amplify our own. People look strange, often do strange and seemingly impossible things while also being lovers, friends, enemies, parents, rivals, siblings, successes and failures. It's the familiar thrown into high relief by being juxtaposed against an unfamiliar background.Families and traveling circuses are at the heart of The Book of Speculation. Simon Watson, a small town librarian in rural Long Island, knows his mother was a \"mermaid\", a carnival performer who could remain submerged for extended periods. Because she died young, by drowning, Simon knows little more about his family history than some names. Now in his late twenties, alone in the decaying cliffside house she loved, Simon feels trapped by the past, but compelled to remain in case his sister Enola, who has followed their mother into the itinerant life of a traveling circus, decides to return. His life seems to be spiraling downwards -- his house looks like its going to be swept into Long Island Sound sooner rather than later, his job is about to be eliminated, he's in love with a woman he's known since childhood. Their relationship is just beginning to blossom, but can it possibly survive? He knows it's time to move on, those around him see it, as will most readers, but Swyler equally makes us feel the emotional chains of love and loyalty that bind him to the only life he knows.Into this swirling tension comes a book sent to Simon by a kindly antiquarian book dealer who discovered the name of Simon's grandmother in its pages. While much damaged, it is clearly the log book of Peabody's traveling circus that plied its trade up and down the east coast in the years following the American Revolution. It also reveals hints about Simon and Enola's family history which Simon, using his experience as a librarian, begins to investigate. It turns out their mother was one of a long line of women with uncanny abilities in the water who nonetheless drown tragically young. Stranger yet, they all die on July 24, a date that is rapidly approaching. Will Enola be next and what can Simon do?At the same time as we read Simon's first person narration of his frantic quest for answers about his family's tragic legacy and forestall it from taking another victim, we are privileged to get an omniscient atmospheric and lyrical tale of two lost souls, the mute boy Amos who is adopted by Peabody's circus and his love, Evangeline, a young girl with her own secrets who is the first 'mermaid' in Simon's family. It is one of the great strengths of this debut that this story line, as infused with folkloric and fantastical elements as it is, is also as emotionally compelling as Simon's race to save his sister.Swyler juggles tension skillfully and creates momentum in, and between, both parts of the novel. She insures that readers will know what Simon must do before he does, but instead of that being a release, it manages to ratchet up the suspense. Small, and not so small details, etch trails of connection and fascination between the two time periods -- water, tarot cards, curses, horseshoe crabs, tides, and rain. I relished them all. This is one of the most satisfying books I've read in a long while, which is to say this is a book to dive into and be intoxicated by. If you loved the movie The Red Violin, Erin Morgenstern's The Night Circus (this is better), or Carlos Ruiz Zafon's The Shadow of the Wind, or Audrey Niffeneger's The Time Traveler's Wife, get thee to a bookstore on June 23rd.

One summer, a stranger sends him a book that contains secrets about his family that have dated back to a carnival in the late 1700's. I really loved the historical aspects of this book--the chapters surrounding the carnival and it's many characters were perfect. I personally didn't really like Simon...I cared more about the people around him, like his sister Enola or his friend Churchwarry.

There is practically nothing of interest here, at least not for me. It even failed to be that kind of light and entertaining read, the type that can be forgiven for its flaws. No trace of engrossing atmosphere or cliff-hangers or surprising discoveries, just a jumble of banal events propelled forward by the narrator's wish to uncover his family's past and find a way to prevent a possible misfortune befalling his sister.Simon Watson is a librarian. An interesting enough starting point which could lead somewhere. It leads nowhere, as he soon looses his job and this detail is there only to account for all the research that goes on in this novel. No noticeable love for books or other feelings I could relate to as a passionate reader. Not sooner has the novel started, that Simon Watson receives an old tome from a stranger, who thought Simon might be interested because the name of his grandmother, Verona Bonn, is inscribed on its pages. What a kind and thoughtful gesture from a total stranger! He certainly has some dark motives for sending this book. No, he doesn't. The ancient book and the stories it reveals were the only interesting aspect of Erika Swyler's novel. As Simon leafs through the tome, trying to understand the connection between his grandmother and this book that seems to be the journal of one Mr. Hermelius Peabody, owner of a travelling circus at the end of the 18th century, another narrative thread emerges, recounting events from the distant past, when there lived a mute boy called Amos and an ethereal girl called Evangeline, who both found a home with Hermelius Peabody's circus. History moves slowly onward, alternating with the events from the present, where Simon Watson worries about the fate of Enola, his sister, but also about the decaying state of their parents' house. Their mother had committed suicide by drowning, although the women in their family were famed for their ability to hold their breath under water, and their father died shortly afterwards, leaving Simon to care for Enola. Even though she doesn't seem to appreciate this too much.There were a lot of ingredients with a high potential for building mystery and suspense (circuses, tarot cards, a strange book, inexplicably deaths by drowning taking place at the same date throughout the centuries), but they were totally lost in a slow-moving narrative, with boring events and boring characters. The tarot cards even became a chore to read about - even though they were mentioned all the time, the author failed to wave magic around them, as she failed to weave magic around the circus. Maybe they would appeal more to a reader who is familiar with their reading, but not to me. The writing is dull, with only a few sparks here and there, the dialogues felt ridiculous at times (a lot of \u201eShit!\u201d or fodder-like replies, with no substance). The characters were quite flat and uninteresting and their dramas failed to touch me, as they couldn't convince me. Simon Watson was always complaining about something - a sprained ankle or his crumbling house or his lack of job. I couldn't care less if Simon's house fell to pieces or if Simon couldn't find another job. His sister, Enola, seemed rather a sketch, she's mainly shuffling the tarot cards or saying \u201eShit!\u201d or going for a swim or cuddling to Doyle - ok, but what else? Amos and Doyle were a tad more interesting, but they lacked a lot of flesh, too, in order to become real people. I couldn't relate or warm up to any of them, Simon, Enola and Alice were the most annoying of all and the only feeling this book squeezed out of me was pity for Mr. Churchwarry, who lost some books because of Simon, and more pity for Madame Ryzhkova and her miserable life. [spoiler] There are a lot of coincidences which felt forced - come on, who gives a total stranger an old book out of the blue (for free!), lends more expensive books to that stranger and later even does research for Simon? I can understand the passion for old tomes & research, but this still felt forced. Plus the way all main characters from present times turned out to be related to the characters in the past. Really? And Mr. Churchwarry, with all his passion for knowledge, had no idea he was a descendant of Madame Ryzhkova?[spoiler] The ending was anti-climatic, but then it suits the book as it is. I wasn't looking for a realistic explanation, I am perfectly satisfied by a supernatural one, if it feels logical in the realm of the book. But here it lacked power and substance, just like the entire novel did. [spoiler] At some point I came to think that all the women had drowned because they did some terrible thing in their past and came to the same conclusion, that they were murderers and should better take their own life. It turned out to be a curse perpetuated by the tarot cards, just that. [spoiler] What about the title? I didn't get it and I don't see how it relates to the plot. It's all a speculation in the end and the descendants can't really understand the lives of their ancestors, or what? Maybe it has to do with the fact that Simon doesn't know the stories we are told (he only catches glimpses of the lives of those mentioned in the book, but not the whole picture) and he can only speculate on their joys and misfortunes and passions. And reasons for taking their own life. Nah, it would be too deep for this book."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "This was a beautiful read (fans of The Night Circus might want to check it out!) that hooked me right from the start and honestly I was totally in this world throughout the read, so wonderfully does it flow.Shifting time between Simon Watson, a young man who receives a mysterious book, and the story of the people within that book, this is gorgeously constructed with some lovely prose and a completely fascinating story.

Simon\u2019s experienced a great loss in his life. His mother, whom he loved dearly, was a performer in a traveling circus as a mermaid. But when Simon and his sister Enola were young, his mother drowns, rumoured to be a suicide. His mother past has always been mystery to Simon.

The journal somehow make mention of his grandmother, but it\u2019s first written in the 1700\u2019s by a circus organiser/manager, Hermelius Peabody. When Simon reads the content of the journal, he begins to investigate his ancestry which in turn leads him to shocking family secrets, and a grim discovery that his family maybe cursed, making its way through family generation to reach his sister Enola. He must find a way to break this curse before his sister is at risk.Books, Librarians, bookstores, travelling circus, tarot cards, mermaids, gypsies, curses, floods! The Book of Speculation had every single right component to entice someone like me who loves books, mystery and magic. It should have been enough to satisfy but unfortunately I was divided. I was most intrigue by the present era and by Simon\u2019s dilemma; how he was going to get out of this mess and why are all these bizarre incidents happening to him? It made me think he\u2019s completely lost his mind and didn\u2019t exactly find him to be a trustworthy narrator. His hold on the house was a complete mystery to me - when he could just as easily sold the house and start fresh. And why was his neighbour so insistent and determined to see that the house is kept?I really enjoyed how all these questions were answered - and so much more, when Simon\u2019s begins to read the book. In alternative chapters the reader is transported to the beginning \u2013 to a weird and wonderful place of spirits, superstition and magic with the travelling circus. When Hermelius Peabody takes in a wild mute boy, Amos, to be part of his freakish sideshow, Amos friendship with a influential Tarot card reader who taught him to read and communicate using tarot cards, and his love affair with the beautiful and bewitching mermaid, Evangeline. The title is quite fitting, the book does raise a lot of speculation; when we discover an uneasy coincidence surrounding the date of Simon\u2019s mother\u2019s death and the date of the women before her; names mentioned in the book seem to be connected or related to people/friends/neighbours of Simon; certain objects noted in the book has been identified in friends homes, which prompted Simon to confront and question them. The prose was stunning and I really loved reading and getting to know the circus troupes and their exceptionally odd talents. The historical chapters are vital to the plot in connecting the pieces together and discovering some shameful hidden truths about Simon\u2019s family. However to get to this point, I found the historical pacing terribly slow and a bit repetitive, but the ending when it came together was brilliant with a surprisingly dramatic finale.
