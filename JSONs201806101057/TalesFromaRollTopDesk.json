Vintage short stories of fine merit. Many with twists quite telling of the times - socially, economically, culturally. Most were thoroughly enjoyable! Vocabulary of breadth and depth, colorful exacting and rich; so refreshing compared to today's limited reaches. And there's many a great quote to be quoted....\"I don't know how to make this plain to you, but our talk, which was cheerful enough, was the least important part of the occasion. Talk tells so little, anyway: most of it's a mere stumbling in an almost foreign tongue when it comes to expressing the inward pangs and certainties that make up life.\" ~ Referred To The Author - a short story; Tales from a Rolltop Desk, Christopher MorleyThis classic, playfully delicious 1927 anthology (oh the joy of holding near century-old treasure in hand) deserves a respectful write up. Oh, but sadly, plucking out quotes with a lengthier review must be delayed. My back is temporarily out of whack, and sitting for long periods is prickly. So, perhaps tomorrow or another day I can withstand tapping a length upon the these keys.....Until then.... FOUR **** Delightful Fun-Pun, Vintage Short Story **** STARS 1/23/16 ADDITIONAL QUOTES: The Prize Package  - \"The feeling that he could marry anybody was delicious to him. But this heavenly eclecticism endures such a short time! For youth abhors generalities and seeks concrete instance.\" Advice to the Lovelorn \"For the first time there broke in upon her, with bitter force, the knowledge that no matter how easy it may be to counsel others, few of us are wise in our own affairs. Pitable paradox: she the \"sympathetic adviser in matters of the heart,\" had made shipwreck of her own happiness.\"  The Curious Case of Kenelm Digby  -\"My boy, there is a rhyme in events as well as in words. When you see two separate and apparently unconnected happenings that seem (as one might say) to rhyme together, you begine to suspect one author behind them both.\" \"It is the function of the poet to have a quick and tender apprehension of similarities.\" Urn Burial  -\"Marriage (say philosophers) is a subdivision of the penal code, dedicated to the proposition that men and women are created equal. But the studious observer of matrimonial feints and skirmishes sees very little to verify that daring surmise.\" Referred to the Author  -\"I thought that I had never seen a man so completely in love. When he looked at her there was a sort of - well, a sort of possession upon him, an enthusiasm, in the true sense of that strange word. I thought to myself that Keats must have looked at Fanny Brawne in just that way.\""}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695870-lynn", "userReview": "A few of these stories were really excellent - especially The Prize Package, Urn Burial and Advice to the Lovelorn. A few others have what I can only assume are meant to be twist endings, but the twist in some cases doesn't add anything or evoke anything. The last story was the worst of these, and also seemed extremely long; the end seemed impossible, or magic, but just didn't make sense to me. Overall, the stories are cute and somewhat interesting for their historical context alone."}], "description": "The prize package.--Advice to the lovelorn.--The curious case of Kenelm Digby.--Gloria and the garden of Sweden.--The Commutation chophouse.--The pert little hat.--Urn burial.--The battle of manila envelopes.--The climacteric.--Punch and Judy.--Referred to the author.", "title": "Tales From a Roll Top Desk", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2814930.Tales_From_a_Roll_Top_Desk", "average": 4.29, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1429174033l/2814930.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/30802.Christopher_Morley", "name": "Christopher  Morley"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Classics", "New York", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2814930-tales-from-a-roll-top-desk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1001312.Parnassus_on_Wheels", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/609284.The_Haunted_Bookshop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2235096.Kitty_Foyle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12393669-kathleen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/412004.Where_the_Blue_Begins"]}
