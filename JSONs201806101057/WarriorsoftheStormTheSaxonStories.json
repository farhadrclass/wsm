First off, Uthred is never described as being handsome in the books. That is a tv fabrication. Okay, I just needed to get that out of the way.Anywho, this is a serviceable book that continues the saga admirably. It's not anything special. No major historically related events take place. It's more personal. In fact, at one point Uthred has to rescue his daughter and son-in-law. It does feel like maybe Bernard Cornwell is wrapping things up. A prominent character from earlier books bites the dust, and when that begins to happen the end is often nigh. However, we're talking about an author who's learned his lesson about rushing a good thing along just to get to the end. With his Sharpe series, Cornwell ended up going back and writing prequels because a tv show had developed and fans clamored for more. I wouldn't be surprised to see the Saxon series double in size before he's done with it. However, it probably should've already ended. I mean, at this point it feels like he's having to pull out of his ass new ways to get Uthred into hot water. Having said that, if he does keep putting out more and more of these, I will keep reading them. It's enjoyable stuff and I'm fully invested in the characters. \"Please sir, may I have some more?\""}, {"userName": "Vagner Stefanello", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12348405-vagner-stefanello", "userReview": "Review in Portuguese from Desbravando Livros:Essa resenha cont\u00e9m spoilers dos livros anteriores.Como j\u00e1 \u00e9 de praxe, no momento em que o autor Bernard Cornwell lan\u00e7a um livro novo das Cr\u00f4nicas Sax\u00f4nicas/Saxon Stories eu j\u00e1 vou correndo atr\u00e1s e tento ler o mais cedo poss\u00edvel, j\u00e1 que essa \u00e9 minha s\u00e9rie favorita e Uhtred de Bebbanburg \u00e9 o personagem que mais gosto. O \u00fanico problema depois disso tudo \u00e9 ter que esperar mais um ano pela sequ\u00eancia, mas faz parte. hahahaDepois de defender a fortaleza de Ceaster contra os ataques dos noruegueses liderados por Sigtryggr no final do volume anterior (O Trono Vazio), Uhtred e seus guerreiros t\u00eam uma nova amea\u00e7a \u00e0 frente: o irm\u00e3o de Sigtryggr, Ragnall Ivarson, um viking poderoso e que comanda \u00fanica e simplesmente pelo medo (Kjartan 2), pronto para saquear as terras da M\u00e9rcia e atrapalhar o sonho do j\u00e1 falecido Alfredo de juntar os reinos existentes e formar a Inglaterra que ele tanto queria.\"Ragnall Ivarson. Eu nunca me encontrei com ele, mas eu o conhecia. Sabia de sua reputa\u00e7\u00e3o. Nenhum homem navegava melhor um navio, nenhum homem lutava mais ferozmente, nenhum homem causava mais terror. Ele era um selvagem, um pirata, um rei de lugar nenhum.\"Velhos conhecidos aparecem e temos alguns dos seus destinos selados. Pessoas que eu nem lembrava direito onde estavam e o que faziam, mas que entraram no caminho de Uhtred por bem ou por mal e o nosso sax\u00e3o ter\u00e1 neg\u00f3cios para resolver. Neg\u00f3cios sangrentos, digamos assim.As descri\u00e7\u00f5es das paredes de escudos est\u00e3o fenomenais, como sempre, e foi exatamente nesse quesito t\u00e3o importante que o autor apostou para retomar a excelente narrativa do 7\u00ba livro, O Guerreiro Pag\u00e3o. Narrativa essa que acabou se perdendo um pouquinho no seguinte, que acabou n\u00e3o sendo um dos melhores volumes da s\u00e9rie. Warriors of the Storm n\u00e3o tem esse problema e os leitores podem ficar tranquilos quanto a isso, j\u00e1 que a carnificina rola solta e desenfreada por aqui.\"Trinta passos, vinte, e voc\u00ea pode ver os olhos dos homens que tentar\u00e3o te matar, e ver as pontas das lan\u00e7as, e o instinto te diz para parar, apertar os escudos. N\u00f3s nos contra\u00edmos durante a batalha, o medo enterra suas garras em n\u00f3s, o tempo parece parar, h\u00e1 sil\u00eancio mesmo que milhares de homens gritem, e naquele momento, quando o terror ataca o cora\u00e7\u00e3o como uma besta enjaulada, n\u00f3s devemos nos jogar para dentro daquele horror. Porque o inimigo sente o mesmo. E voc\u00ea veio mat\u00e1-lo. Voc\u00ea \u00e9 o dem\u00f4nio dos seus pesadelos.\"Tive algumas sensa\u00e7\u00f5es nost\u00e1lgicas durante a leitura, relembrando bastante do Uhtred l\u00e1 dos 2-3 primeiros livros, que desobedecia todo mundo e fazia o que bem entendia. Dessa vez, novas ordens n\u00e3o s\u00e3o cumpridas e elas acabam trazendo algumas consequ\u00eancias. Tudo pela fam\u00edlia, diga-se de passagem. S\u00f3 que dessa vez Uhtred \u00e9 um senhor da guerra, experiente, com reputa\u00e7\u00e3o a mente, com pessoas a seu servi\u00e7o e que dependem da sua palavra, e qualquer amea\u00e7a \u00e0 sua fam\u00edlia, por menor que seja, \u00e9 considerada um ultraje sem precedentes e n\u00e3o deve jamais ser ignorada.\"Eu o faria gritar e assistiria enquanto sangrava, cortaria sua carne fresca em peda\u00e7os antes de me preocupar com \u00c6thelflaed. Isso era pela fam\u00edlia. Isso era por vingan\u00e7a.\"Outro que \u00e9 sempre bom ver por perto \u00e9 Finan, que Uhtred conheceu h\u00e1 muito tempo no per\u00edodo em que era escravo. O irland\u00eas \u00e9 um lutador ex\u00edmio e deixar\u00e1 sua marca em combates singulares.Um dos pontos importantes a se destacar \u00e9 a grande evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de Uhtred ao longo de toda a s\u00e9rie. Agora mais velho, com quase 60 anos, ele n\u00e3o tem o mesmo f\u00edsico de antes e n\u00e3o tem como ser o primeiro cara a pular uma muralha, \u00e9 mais lento que muitos dos seus advers\u00e1rios, mas compensa os seus defeitos com a sua experi\u00eancia de anos na primeira linha das paredes de escudos dos sax\u00f5es.Muitos por a\u00ed dizem que ele \u00e9 apenas um personagem com a profundidade de uma po\u00e7a d\u2019\u00e1gua, mas enganam-se ao n\u00e3o notar que as suas preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo dos livros mudam constantemente, al\u00e9m de ter sempre aquela quest\u00e3o de gostar mais dos dinamarqueses do que dos pr\u00f3prios sax\u00f5es.As piadinhas com os padres continuam e s\u00e3o sempre hil\u00e1rias, disso o leitor jamais poder\u00e1 reclamar.\"Voc\u00ea \u00e9 crist\u00e3o?\"\"Mas \u00e9 claro!\"\"Voc\u00ea acredita em milagres?\" eu perguntei, e ele concordou. \"Ent\u00e3o \u00e9 melhor voc\u00ea pegar os seus cinco p\u00e3es e dois peixes,\" continuei, \"e rezar para que o seu deus miser\u00e1vel providencie o resto.\"Repleto daquele humor irreverente e das batalhas que tanto amamos ver nos livros de Bernard Cornwell, Warriors of the Storm \u00e9 leitura obrigat\u00f3ria para todos os f\u00e3s das Cr\u00f4nicas Sax\u00f4nicas e deve ser feita o quanto antes. O destino \u00e9 inexor\u00e1vel, diriam alguns, e Uhtred parece estar se aproximando cada vez mais de Bebbanburg, a fortaleza na Nort\u00fambria que \u00e9 sua por direito.A edi\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira do nono livro da s\u00e9rie s\u00f3 deve chegar ao Brasil no 2\u00ba semestre de 2016, mas at\u00e9 l\u00e1 temos o seriado baseado na s\u00e9rie e que a BBC est\u00e1 produzindo.

The Saxon kingdoms are in their strongest position yet, with both Mercia and East Anglia on the verge of liberation from the invading northmen. Awaiting him in the north, however, is a grand convergence of enemies both new and old. And a man who dreams of uniting Britain under Norse banners.This ninth book of the Saxon Stories brings back a lot of the good things from the earliest instalments of the series, from characters and locations to the style of presentation. It's very encouraging to see that Cornwell still has his entire repertoire of skills as we move inevitably towards a final conclusion."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40275186-sarah", "userReview": "Price drop: $1.99 in the Kindle Store today!This is (I think) the 9th book in the Saxon Stories series. I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite of Uhtred's tales. This one is probably in the top three.It was a little different from his usual stories. My one gripe with Uhtred has always been that he has always answered to someone. He has never been truly free to do as he pleased. Sometimes he has worked outside the rules to the displeasure of his rulers, but he's never just done as he pleased. In this book, Uhtred did exactly what Uhtred wanted to do and knew needed to be done. It was SO refreshing. The book ends with Uhtred's retirement to take care of his business in the North. While I can't wait to see his triumphant return to Bebbanburg, I'm also a little sad to know it's coming to an end. He is easily one of my all time favorite fictional characters."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1968826-terri", "userReview": "It has been a long time between drinks for me and, after a couple years since the last time I had read a book in this series, boy, it sure was good to be back drinking from the well of Bernard Cornwell's Uhtred. I've missed the big guy, with all his scorching, sardonic quips and his unabashed mocking of just about anybody, he is a big personality to endure, and I endure him with such delight and immense gratitude.  Rarely does a character, consistently, make me smile and laugh out loud as much as Uhtred Uhtredsson of Bebbanburg. He is a character to be enjoyed and can carry these books and their stories on his back alone. No other character can compete and, thankfully, Bernard Cornwell never lets them. His Uhtred takes centre stage at all times. And most especially so in this book. Number nine in the series.These books are stand alone. Cornwell always reiterates important back history so that people who are reading them as a stand alone, or who read the series but need a refresher, can follow along fairly seamlessly. If you do read the series, however, this book has a lot of closing chapters in it. With characters you have known for many, many years, leaving the series for good. I will not tell you who they are, so as not to spoil things, but like or loathe them, it is always a little sad to see characters that we have gotten to know over many years, finally become no more.We even learned a thing or two about Finan in this book. His storyline was fascinating to follow and it felt like another loose end tied up. But, Uhtred is on to new chapters in his life, including, in maybe only a few more books, the end of his own story and the passing of an era, so it is expected to see some loose ends come together. It makes no sense to weave them to their conclusions in the last two books. That would be rushing it.Warriors of the Storm turned out to be one of my favourites of the series. I loved it from start to finish. It could be because the leave taking of a few lingering characters from earlier books left me feeling sentimental. It could be because I did have a break for a couple of years and completely forgot how much I enjoy these books. Or, it could simply be because the book was a bloody good read. I am thinking it is all three, but in saying that, without the first two, I would still regard it highly and recommend to others based on nothing more than it being that good read. The former two matter little when it comes to me thinking of recommending it.With battles and strategies, twists and turns (that you may or may not see coming), short journeys, some seafaring, some nostalgia, Christians who were tolerable for a change and Danes like we love them, brutal, blustery and bombastic, this was an entertaining, well paced read, that made me want to read it all over again as soon as I'd finished it."}, {"userName": "Ace", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23405868-ace", "userReview": "Edit: April 2016 Just finished listening to this one, cannot wait for the next book!May 2015 - Eagerly awaiting this book, I was in two minds about its potential, book 9 in a series, it\u2019s a hard task to keep to your story and maintain the thread of characters but I had nothing to fear!England is full of rich history, and I\u2019m glad to be reading it through this series.

Utred is on the roll again and as before he wishes to uphold the Christian realm of Alfred whilst praising Odin and Thor, bemoaning the evils of the Nailed God. Maybe all these testosterone fueled animosities towards Cornwells strict Episcopal upbringing seems a bit silly at times, but it is truly an enjoyable read. I can't believe that I've made it through book nine already. You see I have a great weakness for all things medieval and dark. It's a childhood passion I've had since I'd lived in Sicily and Denmark in my boyhood. America is just a baby when it comes to holy wars and bloodshed. We've not drank from the bitter cup of war often, and it amazes me how bloodthirsty this new administration is gearing up! This is a book review, so I'll behead my political Cornwell fed moralizing. Book ten looks enticing. The story of England\u2019s making is blood-drenched. Eventually the Northmen (Danes and Norse) will intermarry with the Saxons, but so long as the two sides compete for ownership of the land, then war will continue.

For the record the last Cornwells I read were the Sharpe series back in the day and, though I think I tired a little of the series towards the end, I remember the earlier ones as some of the absolutely best novels I have ever read.So when I had the opportunity to read an advance copy of the new Cornwell, I had to say yes, didn\u2019t I. I did wonder whether I would really be able to get into the novel, being as it\u2019s book #9 and I have yet to read 1 to 8. No need to worry. From the very first page I remembered why I loved Cornwell\u2019s writing. Warriors of the Storm opens straight to the action, dragging the reader right in. It is filled with the smooth, almost effortlessly absorbing prose that I remember being Cornwell at his best. The descriptive is full and rich, the moments of light-hearted humour beautifully worked.Set in the early 10th century, the Last Kingdom series is a strange milieu to me. The Dark Ages is a curious era, full of change and uncertainty. A mish-mash of cultures struggle to dominate Britain, from the Saxons and Danes to the Celts and the Scandinavian vikings, many of whom are by this time based in Ireland and Scotland. As a Roman historian, I am to some extent at a loss with 9th-10th century Britain, so this is fresh unfamiliar ground.However, the bulk of this tale is based in an area I know quite well, that being Chester, the Wirral and surroundings, and to rediscover a place with which I am so familiar (I spend quite a bit of time reenacting there now and research a lot into Roman Deva), thjough in a whole different era, is fascinating.The book opens as a norse lord (Ragnall Ivarson) who has long been an enemy of Uhtred\u2019s begins an attempt to conquer parts of England. Driven out of his previous territory, this lord and his army sail into the Mersey, which is held by Uhtred, and begin to move inland making a play for invasion and control, holding an ancient hill fort and bridging the river into Northumbria, where a vast supply of potential manpower awaits. Cue a desperate campaign to counter the growing strength of Ivarson, who is related to the English hero through his brother\u2019s marriage to Uhtred\u2019s daughter, so yes, politics is inevitably going to play as much a part here as battle.My friends rave about Uhtred. This is my first outing with him and, while he is a traditional hero with a particularly nice turn of phrase at times, I wouldn\u2019t say there is much about him that makes him outstanding to me. That didn\u2019t matter, though, because the supporting cast were so vivid and fascinating that I could deal rather easily without a deep fascination with the hero.Aethelflaed, the daughter of King Alfred who rules Mercia and Wessex, is impressive and powerful, with flaws and uncertainties that make her a far more vivid character than Uhtred. The priests Ceolnoth and Ceolberht were fun and memorable for all their small role, the bishop Leofstan was simply superb, and of Uhtred\u2019s own cadre of warriors, the Irishman Finan was one of the most interesting.Of course if there is one thing for which Cornwell is noted it is his battles. He has a long pedigree of writing warfare across many eras, and this has over time granted him the ability to do so with pace and panache, never having to linger too much in the gory detail while delving deep enough to hook the reader and really create an impression of the horror, glory, and above all desperation of combat.The upshot? Great characters, well-written prose, fascinating locations and excellent battle scenes. The plot might have benefitted from a few extra twists and turns, but that is merely icing on a well-made cake. Warriors of the Storm dragged me in and kept me glued to the end. Well worth a read, and now I am shuffling books 1-8 back up in my pile."}, {"userName": "Bart", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15379874-bart", "userReview": "***Actual rating: 4,75***I've read the whole series this year, so it's easy to say I love these books.

He\u2019s always been a faithful oath man and friend to Uhtred, and I\u2019ve liked his character since their captivity on the slave ship, but his badassery is given its own special spot in this book and, man, is it a breathtaking moment. He\u2019s finally put face to face with his former life, and the events that result affect me on two levels. The incident at the beginning of the book was terrible. He didn\u2019t even know if it was his son! I can\u2019t wrap my head around that kind of passionate anger. But the confrontation with his brother was spectacular.I knelt beside him and called him by his old name. \u201cUhtred? Uhtred!\u201dTell me that didn\u2019t choke you up a little. So Uhtred does have a heart. I knew at some point he\u2019d be confronted with the relationship between himself and his oldest son. When he disowned him for becoming a priest I was pretty upset. I thought What a horrible father! But, he never claimed to be a good one, and I know how much he hates priests. In the heat of his disappointment and anger he rejected him, but I hoped that time would bring Uhtred\u2019s deeper feelings to the surface. No one could have imagined they would reunite under these circumstances, and fatherly affection might be asking too much, but now I can rest easy knowing that my favorite character doesn\u2019t have a heart of stone.Finally, Haestan gets his comeuppance!!! I was sure he\u2019d squirm his way out of trouble again, but he wasn\u2019t clever enough this time. Very satisfying! I love how Uhtred is setting Aethelstan up for the crown, regardless of his father\u2019s intentions. Clever bastard!I knew Brida would eventually stir up trouble, but I wasn\u2019t sure in what capacity. I held a tiny sliver of hope she would rekindle the friendship with Uhtred, but again, asking too much. Uhtred created a true enemy there. After what she did to those poor girls and all those Christians, I can\u2019t really feel any remorse for her. She was a twisted woman, and she got what she deserved. I\u2019m just glad to see Stiorra be the one to give it to her.Speaking of Christians. If you\u2019ve read the series, you know Uhtred is no lover of Christianity, and especially priests, but time and again he helps their cause (yes, his motives are self-serving but he\u2019s still doing their work), and seems to find the rare good person among them\u2026something that I find fairly satisfying. Conversely there are plenty of bad apples, and it\u2019s no surprise when a horrible person misrepresents their claim. (I\u2019m speaking of Mus in this book, but she\u2019s just one of many in this whole series.) I don\u2019t always find these revelations easy to stomach, but I try to keep in mind that there will always be those who have claimed to be something they weren\u2019t, used the Bible or God to excuse their actions or gain power, or promoted practices which were not at all in line with what the Bible teaches. The author isn\u2019t religious, so he isn\u2019t afraid to point out these hypocrisies, but I\u2019m thankful that he places a few little gems in the muck. It\u2019s no surprise Uhtred sees the good in them, and that\u2019s another small satisfaction for me.

It doesn't really stand out as anything special among the rest of the series, but still enjoyable nonetheless. Uthred is great and all, but what keeps me going in the series is some of the supporting cast. Finan, Aethelflaed, and most recently his kids.Uthred is getting old though. I'd like to see him finish up his adventures in another book or two. I only have 1 more left to catch up, and I don't think it's the last. I am starting to hope he doesn't keep dragging this out a bit longer. The ending of this book seemed to go by pretty quick. I was starting to wonder how things would get wrapped up by the end, or if they would be left on a cliffhanger. I was surprised at how well he did bring the book to a close.All that would make it sound like I didn't like the book, but I blew through it in only a few sessions. If not for getting busy in the middle, I'd have likely finished this in 3 days. Overall this was a solid entry in the series, that hopefully inches things a bit closer to the end, albeit not as much as I would have hoped."}, {"userName": "Susan Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172713-susan-johnson", "userReview": "Sometimes a book series starts to go dull when you reach the 10th book but that is certainly not the case with this book. In fact, it's my favorite book so far and I have loved all of them. This has everything- a trip to Ireland, Uhtred's interactions with all three of his children, a reunion with his first love, magnificent battle scenes and an interesting prostitute named Mus who inspires an army. What more can a person ask for? There is just something magical about Uhtred. He was born a Saxon and raised to be the Lord of Bebbanburg. He was captured by the Danes, raised as one and is an ardent follower of Thor. Who can blame him? Thor seems like a delightful God and Valhalla a wonderful place to pass eternity. And the Saxon Christianity? Uhtred says he has seen people whip themselves until their back is strips of flesh, people limp on bleeding stumps to worship the tooth of the whale that swallowed Jonah and a man who hammered nails through his own feet. Uhtred says, \"Why prefer a god who wants you to torture yourself?\" Still he aligns himself with the Saxon Christians because his final goal is to reclaim Bebbanburg, stolen by his uncle. Uhtred is a brilliant military man who seems callous and has no trouble killing. Yet he is loyal and treats his friends and the men under his command well. He loves his children in spite of their very real differences. He is a man that others love to follow. He is a natural leader. In spite of his flaws, he is admirable. This book is a wonderful addition to the series. You can read it as a stand alone as there are plenty of explanations but long time readers, like myself, will enjoy the evolution of Uhtred. And there is an added bonus. The section about Mus is just downright humorous. I laughed so hard at her inclusion at the end of the story. This is a homerun for me and I only regret that I have to wait a year to catch up with him again."}, {"userName": "\u039c\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4903642", "userReview": "Bernard Cornwell did it again!

It is rather eye-opening to the fact that the majority of Cornwell's best books are those with the most battles & set-pieces in them.There is plenty of action, bloodshed, an easily recognisable if completely one-dimensional and thoroughly under-developed bad guy to root against and lots of other stuff to get into here.There are still some significant flaws to be found though. For anyone that knows even the most remotest thing about British geography, it will be glaringly obvious that Cornwell has done virtually none if any research on the location of Chester - 'Ceaster' in the book, its shortened Saxon name - and how that directly impacts on the setup of the plot. Specifically, there is a river just as accessible as the Mersey but which, instead of taking the Vikings to abandoned no man's farmland, would have taken them to the far bigger prize of the fortress of Chester as the river flowed directly alongside the city walls at the time the story is set. It gets most obvious when the characters pontificate on what else they could have done to prevent the Vikings getting access to Mercia, while completely ignoring the elephant in the room, the river Dee.The villain, as alluded to earlier, is woefully underdeveloped and could quite as easily be lifted in or out of the book without even being noticed. He appears in the story so little that he may as well not even exist, he's that ephemeral. The minor supporting roles get more depth and characterisation to them than the person who is meant to be the chief antagonist!In comparison to the previous two, lacklustre, and dusty books - tellingly devoid of many, if any, battle scenes - this book still does enough to pack a wallop and be relatively enjoyable, though lacking that killer touch Cornwell is usually known for.If the villain, and said gaping plot flaw, had actually had more time and effort spent on them, this would easily have been a four star book. As it is, those drawbacks have meant I felt compelled to drag it down to a three out of five instead.A good, solid installment in the series though relatively utilitarian rather than compelling."}, {"userName": "Ctgt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt", "userReview": "It is not difficult to be a lord, a jarl, or even a king, but it is difficult to be a leader.Another entertaining if unspectacular volume in this series.

When the supporting cast is much more interesting than Uhtred, it's time to pack it in. Don't get me wrong there is still plenty of action and intrigue and the book was enjoyable but at this point the Uhtred story needs to wrap up.7/10"}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5737182-kate", "userReview": "Fabulous!

Long enough for Uhtred to now feel Elder Statesman Uhtred. With the Elder Statesman mantle, finally comes the\u00a0growing of 'a pair,' as they say. Uhtred deciding to say 'fuck this for a game of soldiers' and going all-in on re-taking Bebbanburg is what HE wants to do, and the Three Norns, so often used in novels set in this period to cover for not making a decision, be damned! It's a be-freeing feeling, not just for Uhtred, but also for us. Yeah, there are a couple of things to sort first, but after gathering the large part (you'll see) of his family around him, getting strong and throwing off the blah, blah, blah - he's on his way.There is a purpose and a direction often missing in Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Stories, Warrior Chronicles, Last Kingdom Series, whatever you call them, books. A good one, then a so-so. Or two. Still, a so-so from Bernard Cornwell is better than most other Historical Fiction writers' best. Yeah, there is some unwarranted hero worship of his work out there, but I'll give him his due, he may not walk on water, but he does deliver. There is a lot less of the formula feel to Warriors, it just feels better. More honest. More passion and feeling to the writing. More action too. Oh, and more Finnan. He\u2019s a really good character and it's very interesting to get more of his backstory filled in here.What he also does particularly well in Warriors, is write about the waiting for battle, and the hours, minutes, then seconds before the two sides hit. I, and I suspect, Bernard C, have never been in such a situation, but if anyone can make a good stab, slash and cut at how it maybe was, then it's surely Bernard Cornwell in Warriors. Obviously, he's a pacifist, and he does a really good job of showing that most warriors are, in the few seconds before they hit the other shieldwall.He still likes his \u201cAnd...\u201d at the end of sections though, as with \u2018battle joy\u2019 \u2018song of slaughter.\u2019 I'm not sure he doesn't use \u2018battle song of slaughter\u2019 once. And while we're in Matthew Harffy territory...he mentions 'Bernicia,' as preceding Northumberland, and territory-wise, stretching up into Scotland. That might help you with Matthew H's increasingly excellent books, it does me.The best book blog on the web?

Like in all other Cornwell's novels, psychological analysis of the characters is unavoidable.
