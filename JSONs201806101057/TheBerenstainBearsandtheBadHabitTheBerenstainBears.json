Thank God Julia never got into these like I know some kids are. We've read them when we've come across them but other than that we tend to pass them by.

Even some rocks have names for the love of God. Yet members of this family of bears are known by \"brother\" and \"sister\"?

She ends up biting them so much that her fingers hurt so he turns to Mama Bear for help. She first suggested putting tape around Sister Bear's fingers but the kids at school teased her so that didn't work. Papa Bear suggested that Sister Bear would get a dime at the end of the day if she didn't bite her nails. That didn't work and it discouraged Sister Bear. Finally, Gran suggested that he start out with ten pennies, one for each nail, and she kept all the pennies if she didn't bite any of her nails. She had a few set backs, but Sister Bear finally broke her bad habit.One element of fantasy that's seen in this book is that they are bears that can talk and live normal lives. Second, because they're animals, this book is considered to have fantastic people in the real world. The journey Sister Bear goes on is that of finding a way to break her bad habit. The theme of this book relates to the fantasy theme of love and friendship since it takes the help of other to help her break her habit.This book is very brightly colored to attract the eyes of young readers. The shading is very light, bringing a happy, joyful tone to the book. The illustrations are very cartoon-like, adding to the books humorous, comical aspect. There is a big use of framing, like the frames seen in graphic novels, which are used to display movement and transitions."}, {"userName": "Elise", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5733323-elise", "userReview": "My extremely sensitive 4 year old cannot handle much drama in books.
