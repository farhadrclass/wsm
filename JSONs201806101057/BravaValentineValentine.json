Woman takes over the family business, finds true love and grows up emotionally, all at age 35. But I found the book riddled with stereotypes and disappointing characters.--The loud, brash Italian family--The gay best friend who has fabulous fashion and decorating taste and is there for supportive comments and text messages but otherwise has no story of his own --The sexy, wise older love interest who has absolutely no sense of humor (because you can't be wise and be funny)I didn't read the first book in the trilogy, so maybe it's unfair to start with the second one. But the only reason I kept going was because I loved the descriptions of the shoe-making business and the well-developed story line about how Valentine was assuming the leadership of the company and making business decisions.But I pretty much hated all the characters. Everyone inside the family and the inner circle of friends was either boring, exasperatingly annoying or a supportive gay man. Everyone outside the family/circle of friends was a jerk. I loved the scene when Alfred's wife was tearing into everyone -- they all deserved it.And then there's the love interest, Gianluca. He's in his 50s but acts like a 70-year-old. He doesn't like those new-fangled things like email and texting. Instead he writes vanilla love letters on onionskin and sends them par avion. He's very serious -- a father figure for a woman whose own father is incapable of saying big words and who lost the family's respect by cheating on his wife.This isn't the worst book out there, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1211674-dawn", "userReview": "None of Trigiani\u2019s newer books has quite lived up to her original \u2018Big Stone Gap\u2019 trilogy for me. This latest offering, however, disappointed me the most. As this was the second book in a series, I\u2019m familiar with and like the Roncalli / Angelini family, and their various friends and associates, but I felt like there was just too much \u2018stuff\u2019 going on in this book. I found many of the conflicts to be overly contrived, unnecessary to the larger story, and, often, much too easily resolved. I get that in a large family, there\u2019s bound to be a lot of squabbles, but it felt like the author went a little over the top with all the drama. It felt like a lot of the incidents were thrown in just to show that, in the end, love conquers all. That may be true, but I still could have done with a simpler story, focusing a little more on the characters themselves. I\u2019m not sure whether there will be a third book in this series. If there is, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll read it, just because I need to find out how it all ends. I will, however, go into it with lowered expectations."}, {"userName": "Angelc", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1445462-angelc", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to win this book in a Goodreads First Reads contest. I had heard great things about the first book in this series, and jumped at the chance to read the sequel. The book is a funny but heartfelt story of a young Italian American woman trying to find herself against the backdrop of her large overbearing family and the family custom shoe business.Valentine and her grandmother had been partners in running the Angellini Shoe Company as well as roommates in the apartment above the business. So Valentine feels a major blow when Gram gets remarried and moves to Italy with her husband. Now Valentine can't hide behind her cozy life with Gram and also take a backseat as Gram runs the company. She has to step up and figure out what she wants from life and the business. Valentine is used to letting her family define who she is and what she does, and she doesn't make her own life for herself. When Gianluca, her grandmother's new stepson, makes his feelings known to her, she has the opportunity to step up and build her own life, not do what she's expected by her family. But will she try to make the change or will she keep to her steady, predictable pattern?I loved all the vivid characters in Valentine's family and her friends June and Gabriel. These characters and Valentine's relationships with them were really what made me enjoy this book.However, there were aspects of the novel that I didn't like. I really had trouble with the age difference between Valentine and her love interest, Gianluca-18 years!! She is 34 and he is 53. I'm not really a fan of this type of romance, but if that interests you, you will love this story! Another reason why the age difference didn't work for me is because Valentine is already admittedly immature. Then when she becomes infatuated with a 53 year old, it reinforces the idea that she wanted a father figure- someone else to take care of her and make her decisions for her.There was a tone of melancholy throughout the book, especially in the last third, because the theme of cheating was prevalent. Three married couples deal with cheating in this book, and it started to get sad, especially because her father's affair was mentioned over and over as a hurdle for their family.The book is written very well, with great plotting and pacing, the characters are deep and developed. If you like books that are about real life struggles, then this is the book for you!! reviewed for: http://inthehammockblog.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/254596-mary", "userReview": "Brava, Valentine begins on a day filled with happiness in Tuscany. The sparkling snow that falls reflects the spirit of the Roncalli/Angelini family. Their beloved matriarch Teodora is marrying Dominic Vechiarelli. The octogenarians kept their relationship a secret for many years but finally decided to marry. Adriana Trigiani had me laughing at the family antics as they prepare for the wedding. Dominic's son is at the wedding. Gianluca Vechiarelli made quite an impression on Valentine on her last trip to Italy (Very Valentine). She definitely feels something for him when she sees him at the church but things don't go as she would hope. From the reception on, surprises seem to come at her full force. Life is changing.Teodora will live with her new husband in Italy while Valentine takes the reins at the Angelini Shoe Company back in Greenwich Village. There are challenges to be faced: a new business partner; a long-time employee who hints at retiring; the need for a business loan to launch a new shoe line; a possible new branch on the family tree to check out; and a long-distance romance. Valentine is full of energy and up to the challenges at work but something is missing in her life. Gianluca (17 years her senior) is very interested in her as she is in him yet how can they make it work? He is in Italy and she is across the Atlantic. He sends romantic letters that get her attention but can she possibly be the woman he seems to idolize?Trigiani takes the reader to Italy, New York, and Buenos Aires. I loved the descriptions of the different locations. It was also fun to read about Valentine's friend and new roomie Gabriel as he redecorated the living space above the shoe company. The rooftop garden never looked so good! I also enjoyed the descriptions of shoe design and manufacturing.This is a very romantic book - I loved it. I can't wait for the next book in this wonderful series.Brava, Adriana Trigiani."}, {"userName": "Sjcapanna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682382-sjcapanna", "userReview": "Rating chick-lit is like rating the taste of water: it could technically be really bad, but it's never going to be totally life-changing and interesting. Yet, like water, you need it sometimes. But still, bland.This book is the second in a trilogy about an Italian family who owns the last mom-n-pop factory in Greenwich Village. They make custom wedding shoes. The first book was fun, getting caught up in the details of the pretty shoes and learning about the wacky family. I also appreciated a female protagonist who had chosen her career over love, as well as somebody who had found a career she was truly passionate about. In this second book, things just got old. The family was annoying. The main character is, indeed, pursuing a love interest, and he's old and creepy. I guess I'm just not that romantic, because the flowery love letters he sends on onion-skin paper (whatever that is) just seemed to be cheesy and coming on too strong. And at one point he says, \"Love builds on a series of small realizations,\" which is what this book largely consists of: page after page of realizations this woman has about love, how it's like this but not like that, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Enough already. I don't think I want to read the third book, but with a trilogy it's like wanting to catch up on somebody from high school on Facebook; you kind of have this desire to find out how everything turns out for these people."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5968522-karen", "userReview": "I'm a huge Trigiani fan, and I wanted to love this book. While it is an enjoyable read, filled with her trademark lively descriptions and characters, it lacked the believability of her other books. Valentine's relationship with Giancarlo, central to the novel, was almost absent of dialogue. I never really saw the connection between the two of them - just a few love letters and too few conversations. The brother's escapade felt like a cliche - we never get to know him well enough to understand how it happened. Also, Valentine's best non-gay friend encounters another marital problem that felt placed in the story to make a point, rather than emerging from the characters themselves. Perhaps one problem was that the book relied too much on developments in the previous novel, and it has simply been too long since I read that one. But while I will definitely read the third installment, this second one was not a classic Trigiani."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/865502-diane", "userReview": "The author does terrific job creating characters whom the reader cares about. I like that Valentine doesn\u2019t have it all figured it, that she struggles with family, career, love and friends. Even the minor characters are real and well-drawn, from June, the fabric cutter to Roberta, the new-found cousin to Pamela, the sister-in-law who doesn\u2019t fit in.Trigiani comes from a close-knit Italian family herself, and she excels at the family relationships and scenes. Everyone can relate to the family dynamics that occur during weddings and family dinners, culminating with a Thanksgiving dinner that starts out with such promise and high hopes, only to disintegrate into a truth-telling, secret-spilling train wreck. Tough topics, such as infidelity, job loss, death and racism are also tackled in the novel; Trigiani does not shy away from the tougher things in life we all face. She also does humor very well; you will find yourself laughing out loud when Valentine and Gianluca are almost caught naked in a hotel by her young niece.Trigiani is a very visual author. Her scenes are so detailed, and they scream out to be made into a visual medium of some type- a film or a TV miniseries. Luckily, Lifetime TV has optioned the first novel in teh series, VERY VALENTINE, for a movie; I can't wait!She describes the shoes she creates in such detail that I had hoped to see sketches of them in the novel. Her trips to scenic Italy and Argentina, her Greenwich Village neighborhood and the extreme home makeover of Gram\u2019s apartment above Angelini Shoes by her gay best friend Gabriel are so vividly described, the reader can picture it all so clearly in her mind.\u201cThe living room is wallpapered in cream with a black-striped border. Gabriel has positioned his zebra-print love seats in front of the windows. He created draperies that mimic stage curtains, opulent turquoise silk drapes with black silk braid tiebacks. He used Gram\u2019s simple black onyx-based lamps to anchor the love seats.\u201dFood is another important element in her novels, and I swear you can almost smell the cannolis the Roncalli sisters are stuffing for dessert. (In the paperback version of VERY VALENTINE Trigiani added a section titled \u201cEat and Read\u201d containing recipes for some of the dishes in the novel- a definite incentive to buy the paperback.) Readers must be prepared to use all of their senses when reading BRAVA, VALENTINE smelling and tasting the Italian delicacies, seeing the beautifully designed shoes, and the scenery of Italy and Argentina- it is truly a sensual experience.Trigiani also pays tribute to music in BRAVA, VALENTINE. Gram has a collection of Frank Sinatra albums, and the author has titled each of the chapters a different Sinatra song- \u201cIt Isn\u2019t a Dream Anymore\u201d, \u201cAutumn in New York\u201d, \u201cPolka Dots and Moonbeams\u201d are examples. It\u2019s a clever homage to a great Italian-American singer.BRAVA, VALENTINE is a must-read for fans of Meryl Streep\u2019s film \u201cIt\u2019s Complicated\u201d and \u201cSex in the City\u201d."}, {"userName": "I'd So Rather Be Reading {Nat}", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2876030-i-d-so-rather-be-reading-nat", "userReview": "Reading an Adriana Trigiani book is like eating Godiva chocolate---decadent, delicious, and over way too quickly. Brava, Valentine is Trigiani's best book yet, in my opinion. While her other books usually make me laugh a couple of times, Brava, Valentine had a lot more humor in it. I laughed, I cried, I finished the book in record time, totally satisfied. Trigiani has not yet released the name or publication date of the third book in the Valentine series, but Brava, Valentine does not employ a cliff-hanger ending like so many other series. The reader is left wanting more, but not desperately waiting (like I am for Mockingjay, for example). If you've never read an Adriana Trigiani book, I recommend starting with Very Valentine, then Brava, Valentine.

Totally found myself tearing up, my heart breaking over the dynamic tension that leaped off the pages.Also, I Wikipedia-ed a lot of things, such as some of the interior designers and patterns that were referenced, and the detail that Trigiani goes into when Valentine is at the shoe factory has awakened an interest in me to learn more about that process. I see more books about shoes in my future...I like that it ended at a place that left room for a future installment of the Valentine series, although I felt that even at the end of this book, things turned out a lot more neatly than it would in real life. Then again, I had to keep in mind that this story is told over a course of a year, and that my turning from one chapter on one day to the following chapter the next day did not mean that only a day had passed in the world of the book.If and when the next Valentine book comes out, I'll look forward to reading it!"}, {"userName": "Gaby", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1185483-gaby", "userReview": "Brava, Valentine is the fun, satisfying sequel to Very Valentine.

The story opened crisply and reminded me of how much I enjoyed Very Valentine. Unfortunately, a couple of the plot lines bogged down; however, the need to know how things turn out kept this reader slogging along. I believe I read somewhere that Valentine's story would be a trilogy, but I'm not sure how much more there is to tell about her and the Angelini Shoe company.Notes & QuotesBecause I love all things pen and ink, this from page 67 made me smile: His handwriting is artful, that glorious Italian script with the curlicue edges. He wrote it with a fountain pen in midnight blue ink. A fountain pen in 2010! Miraculous!On page 154, a wonderful description of family traditions: The Fitzpatricks and the Roncallis are people who gather in kitchens around a tray of homemade manicotti, not in fancy living rooms where silver trays of canapes are passed. Where we come from, champagne is for toasting, good china is for holidays, and silver place settings are heirlooms while love is given freely, not something exchanged in hopes of material gain or social status. There is something to be treasured about people who know instinctively when enough is enough.On p. 226 about the art of letter writing: A handwritten letter carries a lot of risk. It's a one-sided conversation that reveals the truth of the writer. Furthermore, the writer is not there to see the reaction of the person he writes to, so there's a great unknown to the process that requires a leap of faith. The writer has to choose the right words to express his sentiments, and then, once he has sealed the envelope, he has to place those thoughts in the hands of someone else, trusting that the feelings will be delivered, and that the recipient will understand the writer's intent."}, {"userName": "Cameran", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16033752-cameran", "userReview": "Brava, Valentine is the perfect sequel because I enjoyed it even more than the first book! This is what all authors should aspire to do -- they should build off of plotlines set before and expand them along with the growth of their characters. Valentine\u2019s growth in this novel was wonderful; as a reader I took so much from her journey to discover the necessity of love when creating art, as well as her transformation to being the boss of the Angelini Shoe Company. Another favorite character of mine was Alfred, who is Valentine\u2019s older brother. What we know of him from the first book is that he is sanctimonious and does not get along with any members of his family. Since this book is set in 2010 and recognizes the failing economy of the United States, Alfred is brought down from the high pedestal he has always been placed upon. He makes mistakes and must learn how to fix them. His relationship with his sister finally improves, but what was so magical about his storyline was that it was so realistic.I think Adriana Trigiani is a masterful storyteller. She also has a very firm grasp on her opinion of love and how to convey that opinion to those reading her books. All the characters in Brava, Valentine must come to terms with their current stances on love and where they want to be in the future in terms of love. It is not all about romantic relationships, either; love transcends to include family and friendships. The messages here are so profound and I believe that so many people will find something to connect to or something to learn.My final verdict would be to read this book. Fans of the first book will be pleased, and those new to these characters should start with the first story, Very Valentine. The characters are humorous and relatable to what I see in my everyday life. The messages of love, family, work, inner peace, and friendship make you think about yourself. This is a very good book and I cannot wait to read the third."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/263244-sarah", "userReview": "I scored a free copy of this book courtesty of a< href=\"http://www.bookclubgirl.com/book_club... Club Girl, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved it!

The book is a second in a series (I didn't read the first; I don't think it's necessary) following the sleek, sophisticated Valentine Roncalli. Valentine had plans to take over the custom wedding shoe company that had been in her family for generations, but learns on the night of her grandmother's wedding that she must share ownership with her brother, Alfred--an outlier in an otherwise close family who refuses to forgive his father for a transgression made years prior. In hopes of proving her worth to her brother and her family, Valentine puts everything into her career and finds herself making a long lost family connection in Buenos Aries. On top of all of this, Valentine is attempting to maintain a long distance relationship with the man of her dreams. Think \"Sex and the City\" meets \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\" Although set in New York, the book also prominently features Italy and Buenos Aries. Her family is loud, boisterous and fun, and Valentine's supporting cast of characters are endearing. Yes, we've heard the whole \"put family above all else\" before, but somehow, you believe Trigiani when she says it, and you find yourself wanting to immerse yourself in Valentine's family (crazy though they may be.)

While I still appreciated the characters and the stories, I felt the author psychologically beat-up her main character too much-- while the heroine (Valentine) needs to learn trust, and to \"let go,\" in order to find love, I found her love interest (Gianluca) to be manipulative and stubborn. Gianluca is just as petulant and childlike as he accuses Valentine of being, yet only Valentine grows in the novel. Valentine realizes the error of pushing romance away, whereas Gianluca never makes amends for refusing to recognize Valentine as an independent, career-minded woman with thoughts and goals of her own. I would have appreciated more sophistication, and less traditional gender role stereotyping, in the novel's approach to romance-career balance. The characters whose stories provide foil for the struggles of Valentine and Gianluca-- traditional marriages that fall apart because the husbands stray or the housewives feel stifled-- are also horribly cliche and lack a deft touch. And the supporting character of gay-best-friend Gabriel is too darn perfect to be believed; he seemed more realistic in the series' first installment.

The tale is predictable, but it didn't matter. There are no language issues or sex scenes that will make you blush, but the subject matter is adult and not dumbed down in the least. This is a sequel to Very Valentine, and while not necessary, I would suggest you read that one first to get the most out of this follow-up. The story follows Valentine as she takes over the family business, and in the process finds love. She is a thirty-five year old custom shoemaker living in Manhattan. She has a crazy and involved family, and the story follows this dynamic entrepreneur as she tries to carve out a life for herself. The story is funny and light. In my opinion, Trigiani is a great author to read if you are waiting for the next book by Debbie Macomber."}, {"userName": "Vickie", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/253719-vickie", "userReview": "WOWEE wow wow!! I thought BIG STONE GAP was my favorite book written by Adriana Trigiani, but it is now second after having listened to BRAVA, VALENTINE. I was in love with VERY VALENTINE and became enraptured with this second of the trilogy. Now I really can't wait to see what happens in the third one whenver that one comes out. I will get it as an audiobook, too. Hell, I may go get everything Trigiani has written as an audiobook! Especially if Cassandra Campbell is narrating. Campbell is big part of the magic of this trilogy. She voices the characters wonderfully. I adore Valentine, grin at her bestest buddy Gabe, and swoon over Gianluca. There's not much more that I can say that wasn't covered in the passage above from the back of the BOCD cover. Except that I loved watching Valentine come to terms with her Gram marrying and moving to Italy; learning how to be partners with her brother; finding out what it was like to trust her heart to someone. She had a lot of growing up to do and she didn't even realize that she needed to. Please, please, please! Do yourself a huge hug and get this book to read or listen to. It is wonderfully gorgeous!!!Five Wowee wow wow sparkly diamonds...."}, {"userName": "Francesca", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/242054-francesca", "userReview": "I have always enjoyed Trigiani's books, mostly because I can relate to the Italian-American story lines, family sagas, ect. Up until now, my favorite book of hers has been Lucia, Lucia; however, Brava, Valentine has changed the stakes...I think it is because I relate so much to the main character, Valentina, that I now rate this is my number 1 favorite read from Trigiani. Trigiani has written a plethora of novels and is an expert in writing about her own experiences growing up in an Italian-American family. I think any reader who has enjoyed the works of Jennifer Weiner would very much enjoy the heroines that Trigiani cooks up. However, while Weiner's best work (in my mind) is \"Good in Bed\" - her first novel - I think that Adriani has actually created her best series yet much later in her writing career. Yes, folks, I'm talking about the Roncalli-Angelini book series that started with \"Very Valentine\", continued with \"Brava, Valentine\", and will conclude with \"Ciao, Valentine\" (out in 2011)."}, {"userName": "Joanne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1174036-joanne", "userReview": "A contemporary love story with old-fashioned values too. I was hooked fromthe first pages of this gem.The story starts with the wedding of Valentine's grandmother on Valentine'sDay in Italy. It ends with Christmas Eve in NY\u2019s Greenwich Village. Thefamily\u2019s Thanksgiving scene is memorable.Valentine comes for an Italian family of bridal shoe designers. This storydetails her business expansion into a moderate priced line of ballet flats.Her project includes dealing with her brother in a partnership (and theyhaven't had the best relationship), working with an ex-fianc\u00e9 as herbusiness development manager, and meeting unknown family in Buenos Aireswho are also shoemakers, but for a men's line.In addition to Valentine's business project she's interested in an ItalianGianluca. Their romance across the continents is charming and somewhat oldfashioned. His love letters to Valentine are to be cherished.Add to the mix an Italian family. If you've ever been part of one, you canonly laugh at the reality of their actions and drama."}, {"userName": "Keturah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/328614-keturah", "userReview": "This was the second of three books in Trigiani's most recent series about Italian-Americans. I did not really like the first book in the series (Very Valentine) and I'm not a huge fan of this book either. I don't find Valentine to be a likable or very interesting main character. I am much more fond of the supporting cast of characters including Valentine's mother, her best friend, and her sisters."}, {"userName": "Lisa Montanaro", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15508217-lisa-montanaro", "userReview": "Another great book in The Valentine series by Adriana Trigiani. This one is just as good as the first. I love this crazy, quirky Italian American family from NY. They drive you nuts at times and you want to shake them as they make many mistakes. But their heart is always in the right place! Looking forward to the third and last book in the series so I can find out how Valentine makes out with her family shoe company and her Italian lover Gian-Luca."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4156607-barbara", "userReview": "I have just finished this book and I loved it. I can visualize the location, the characters. The family dynamics she creates are funny and sad at the same time. It follows \"Very Valentine\". It also leaves the door open for another in the series. I do not know if I would recommend it to any of you readers, but it was a great escape for me."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/967766-suzanne", "userReview": "Loved this book!
