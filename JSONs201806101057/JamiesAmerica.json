First, the positive. The photography in the book is excellent. The recipes overall do look pretty good an appetizing, and Jamie's short essay segments are pretty good to read. The negative? This is not a book for those who need to or want to follow a healthy diet. I think that it is a bit of a sharp contrast to Jamie's more recent healthy eating campaign (just look up his TED talk to get an idea what I mean). But ok, I can do go along with that. What I really did not like is that a lot of the recipes call for ingredients that you are not likely to find unless you shop at Whole Foods on a regular basis (and that assumes you even have a Whole Foods in town, which we do not where I live now). So, that seemed to make the book a bit less accessible to me in terms of recipes I may have wanted to try making. Having said the above, Jamie does give a pretty good look at American cuisine overall, showing it as the diverse canvas that it is from big cities like New York to the bayous of Louisiana to the Arizona desert. And what he is doing is giving those traditional cooking ways his own touch as well. I think this is a book people will enjoy, maybe make a recipe now and then as a treat, but it seems more enjoyable as a coffee table kind of book, i.e. very nice to look at."}, {"userName": "The Book Whisperer (aka Boof)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1253478-the-book-whisperer-aka-boof", "userReview": "I loathe cooking but I love books (and food!). My husband loathes reading but loves cooking - et voila! I read the book and tell him what yummy foods I want him to cook and he gets down and dirty in the kitchen while I bark orders. Perfect!Did I mention I hate cooking? Well, I really do. I am totally crap at it. However, I can spend many an hour drooling over a good cook book like Jamie's latest offering. In this one he has toured America and experienced local cooking for himself and in true Jamie style added a few twists of his own. There are sections on food from New York, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia, Los Angeles etc and each section comes with at least a 2 page spread about his time there and who he met that inspired him, complete with lots of pictures. He then dedicates each section to dishes from that region, which all look totally scrummy, and tells us how to cook them rather than just listing the ingredients and bullet point instructions.I have had 3 dishes from this book now, all lovingly prepared while I sit with my feet up, and I can give it a huge thumbs up so far."}, {"userName": "Justin Walshaw", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76423085-justin-walshaw", "userReview": "Entering what can only be called his Bruce Springbean phase of midlife crisis, our hero Mr Oliver boldly wears a white t-shirt to a chilli cook-off and accidentally dismantles the military-industrial complex whilst looking for a lavatory in the White House"}, {"userName": "Margie Van Evera", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28433684-margie-van-evera", "userReview": "I have marked so many pages in this cookbook - the recipes are interesting, not complicated, and making my mouth water going through them.

Although Oliver doesn't cover all of the regional varieties available here, I'm excited to try his twists on some Southern, Western, and Cajun classics. I also enjoy Oliver's writing style. He gently reminds readers to balance the unhealthier options with light sides, and to only eat the heavy stuff as a treat. He also sprinkles his sense of humor throughout the book. This is a beautiful book filled with delicious-looking pictures, and there's a fair amount of writing in here in addition to simply recipes."}, {"userName": "Christine Jolley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1201313-christine-jolley", "userReview": "Being a Yankee in the UK I miss American food. It was fantastic to actually see a real-life cookbook full of 'proper' food from my country. He's got all the classics in there and making it from scratch is healthier than the processed stuff.

I enjoyed reading his take on American food, trying to debunk the myths that the British have with regard to American cooking. Beautiful photography and engaging short articles throughout the book about the places he visited, the people he met and worked with in creating this book.He covers New York City (Pizza, Burgers), Los Angeles, Louisiana (New Orleans - Cajun), Georgia (BBQ), Arizona (which incorporates Native American dishes as well as Mexican food), and Wyoming (cowboy food). He completely leaves out the North, which has their own Scandinavian food traditions, and the Midwest, which has their own brand of cooking. Some of the ingredients I've never heard of, and I don't know too many people that would be willing to cook alligator. Some of the dishes are more simple, like his version of Waldorf Salad or Peach Cobbler. His use of organic ingredients is hit or miss with each dish. There doesn't seem to be any consistency there. His use of British words (i.e. Liquidizer for Blender) can be confusing. An entertaining read, but I won't attempt more than a few of the recipes."}, {"userName": "Nat", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8860384-nat", "userReview": "I have to say I wasn't a huge Jamie Oliver fan but I watched every episode of Jamie's America and some of the meals sounded so good I had to buy the book. This is now one of my go-to books for something tasty when I need to live up to the reputation that I can cook! I've made the odd change here and there to fit the taste buds of the people I'm feeding and because I'm not always able to source the exact ingredients he mentions. I thoroughly recommend the Best Baked Beans. I soak 3 choices of beans overnight, start off in a pan and then transfer to the slow cooker. We eat it as a main meal with freshly baked sour dough loaf...The Southern-style pork is the best thing here though - I saw my husband of 23 years eat fresh chillies for the first time and love them - that'd be the mint, which this book is!"}, {"userName": "Ina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1627590-ina", "userReview": "I confess I'm addicted to Jamie. That's why I normally buy every new book of him. Last time I didn't cause I knew most of the recipes in 'Ministry of Food'. This time there were lots of new and promising ideas in the book. The appearance was appealing as always - designed in the usual solid (Jamie)style: Great pictures, clearly arranged recipes and some enjoyable stories. But after trying the fist ones I recognised most of the things were just not my taste. I liked the wild west rice (p 320)and of course the NYC cheesecake and the velvet cupcakes, but I would have been more satisfied if Jamie would have picked some other states for his book.

His epic journey will take him to the heart of America: its people, culture, music and, most importantly, its food. Along the way Jamie will be getting his hands dirty - meeting hunters, cowboys, fishermen and local producers - as he finds out about the best (and strangest) ingredients on offer. He won't just be sampling, he'll be getting involved: entering a gumbo 'throw-down' in Louisiana, fishing in California and sampling bison in Montana as he joins life on a ranch. As well as being a visually stunning journey, \"Jamie's America\" is a practical cookbook, with each chapter focusing on the food and recipes of a different state. And the food will be as varied as the landscapes - from spicy Mexican in the desert to freshly caught Alaskan salmon.
