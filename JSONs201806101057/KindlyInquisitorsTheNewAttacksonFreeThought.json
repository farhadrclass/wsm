These essays held my interest from the title's Inquisition allusion to the closing words. Jonathan Rauch defends free thought by dissecting numerous case studies on the attack of free speech. He frames his argument as a defense of liberal science and dives into this defense through the context of epistemology, a topic I was not very familiar with before reading this book. I found myself highlighting quotes and passages every 5-10 pages or so and the book answered many of the questions/internal debates I had on the topic. However, I am still conflicted when it comes to the interaction of free speech and economic decisions. I agree with most every argument in favor of liberal science's defense of thought, but I feel the \"vote with your pocketbook\" idea is at odds with the argument to never punish someone for their ideas. This conflict is not explored within the book, at least to my satisfaction. Still, it is an excellently written book and worth a read if the topic interests you."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7133444-sandra", "userReview": "This is a gem of a book. It is the most thorough and well argued stance in favor of free speech I have so far encountered. Originally published in 1993, it is still completely relevant, probably, as they say, more than ever. It is very easy to lose oneself in the daily tweety outrages that have been reaching ridiculous proportions lately. Jonathan Rauch's book managed to put both my thinking about the world, and my half baked intuitions about what is right and what is absolutely essential, in order, and infuse them with rationality and calmness and even kindness. This is not to say that I managed to separate myself from the pessimistic side - at best, my belief is that it will get (much) worse before it gets better, and if."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9912047-peter", "userReview": "This book was strong - I would recommend it to anyone, and despite being written 25 years ago (the book was originally penned in 1993), the book felt critically relevant. Ostensively about free speech, the book is probably more appropriately viewed through an epistemic lens, with Rauch viewing epistemology as deeply intertwined with politics. His crisp language cuts deeply at the core of questions that remain relevant to this day: does the identity of a speaker tarnish the validity of that speech? How do we maintain our right to fight against ideas we find repugnant without suppression and censorship? Who has the right to bless speech, and with it, the ideas that we find acceptable in polite society?Overall, the book was well worth the read. Quick and to the point, it was a solid primer on epistemology and made me think a lot about how I adjudicate truth in my own life. The crux of this book is highlighted in the quote below, and we would do well to think hard about where we fall on the spectrum:\"What should be society\u2019s principle for raising and settling differences of opinion? In other words, what is the right way, or at least the best way, to make decisions as to who is right (thus having knowledge) and who is wrong (thus having mere opinion)?To the central question of how to sort true beliefs from the \u201clunatic\u201d ones, here are five answers, five decision-making principles\u2014not the only principles by any means, but the most important contenders right now:- The Fundamentalist Principle: Those who know the truth should decide who is right.- The Simple Egalitarian Principle: All sincere persons\u2019 beliefs have equal claims to respect.- The Radical Egalitarian Principle: Like the simple egalitarian principle, but the beliefs of persons in historically oppressed classes or groups get special consideration.- The Humanitarian Principle: Any of the above, but with the condition that the first priority be to cause no hurt.- The Liberal Principle: Checking of each by each through public criticism is the only legitimate way to decide who is right.The argument of this book is that the last principle is the only one which is acceptable, but that it is now losing ground to the others, and that this development is extremely dangerous. Impelled by the notions that science is oppression and criticism is violence, the central regulation of debate and inquiry is returning to respectability \u2014 this time in a humanitarian disguise."}, {"userName": "Wendi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/974110-wendi", "userReview": "By page 4 I was already enthralled: \"A very dangerous principle is now being established as a social right: Thou shall not hurt others with words.

Originally published in 1993, the book is even more relevant today than it was back then, resulting in an expanded edition in 2013. With brisk and efficient clarity, Rauch exposes the authoritarian intellectual underpinnings of the nominally liberal thought police that hold sway over America's universities. He goes further and argues that these initiatives - although carried out with the best of intentions - pose a grave danger to the very foundations of the liberal system. Ultimately, he says, \"The answer to the question \u201cWhy tolerate hateful or misguided opinions?\u201d has been the same ever since Plato unveiled his ghastly utopia: because the alternative is worse.\"The book's tone is captured nicely by one of Rauch's incendiary passages:If you are inclined to equate verbal offense with physical violence, think again about the logic of your position. If hurtful opinions are violence, then painful criticism is violence. In other words, on the humanitarian premise, science itself is a form of violence. What do you do about violence? You establish policing authorities \u2014 public or private \u2014 to stop it and to punish the perpetrators. You set up authorities empowered to weed out hurtful ideas and speech. In other words: an inquisition... It is bad enough to have to remind people that there is no right not to be offended, and that criticism is not the same as violence. It is deeply embarrassing to have to deliver this reminder to people at the center of American intellectual life.The core of Rauch's argument is that \"Epistemology \u2014 one\u2019s view of who can have knowledge and when \u2014 is politics.\" That line could very well be the tagline for my 2017 reading theme on the integrity of Western science. This book gifted me a clear statement of how all of the philosophy of science reading I've been doing relates to larger political questions. Rauch has an explicitly Popperian view on the philosophy of science: \"you may claim that a statement is established as knowledge only if it can be debunked, in principle, and only insofar as it withstands attempts to debunk it.\" For Rauch, skepticism and empricism are the pillars of the liberal system. I'm a bit concerned about how his overall argument holds up in the face of the holes that the modern philospher Godfrey-Smith pokes in Popper's theories, but to be fair, none of the critiques of free speech that I've ever heard have contested Popperian epistemology!The book is full of little gems like those above - sentences that crystallize ideas that have been amorphously floating around in my brain all year. Rauch writes beautifully, tracing the genealogy of liberal thought and synthesizing millenia of Western history to make the case for why we must prevent restrictions on free speech and free thought. He recoils in horror from Plato's intellectually authoritarian regime. He rejoices in the skepticism of Montaigne. He whips us through a tour of major Enlightenment philosophers and ends with our good friend Sir Karl Popper.Rauch then extends our intellectual journey up to the controversy over Salman Rushdie's \"The Satanic Verses\". Rushdie's searingly controversial novel earned him a big target on his back - in the form of a fatwa issued by Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. For Rauch, this represented a defining moment in Western intellectual history:It showed how readily Westerners could be backed away from a fundamental principle of intellectual liberalism, namely that there is nothing whatever wrong with offending \u2014 hurting people\u2019s feelings \u2014 in pursuit of truth. That principle seemed to have been displaced by a belief in the right not to be offended, which was quickly gaining currency in America.Rauch covers an astonishing amount of ground in this book and I felt like I highlighted about half the book as I tore through it. His principled, clearly argued position on free speech was just the antidote I needed for the philosophical morass I got sucked into during undergrad. I'll close with another one of my favorite quotes - some practical advice for free-speech campaigners in the hostile territory of the modern academic postmodern left:The standard answer to people who say they are offended should be: \u201cIs there any casualty other than your feelings? Are you or others being threatened with violence or vandalism? No? Then it\u2019s a shame your feelings are hurt, but that\u2019s too bad. You\u2019ll live.\u201d If one is going to enjoy the benefits of living in a liberal society without being shamelessly hypocritical, one must try to be thick-skinned, since the way we make knowledge is by rubbing against one another.Full review and highlights at https://books.max-nova.com/kindly-inquisitors"}, {"userName": "Sabin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin", "userReview": "1993: \"[...] homosexuals, like all minorities, stand to lose far more than they win from measures regulating knowledge or debate.

But the wheel will turn, and the majority will reassert itself, and, when the inquisitorial machinery is turned against them, homosexuals will rue the day they helped set it up.\"2016: \"Make America great again!\"Jonathan Rauch's essay in defence of liberalism in all its forms, free thought, free speech, democracy and capitalism feels now, sadly, like a timely warning which has gone unnoticed while it had the political power of a warning. Now it can be read as a justification of the status quo. The repressed, be they minorities or the majority, reassert themselves and turn on those who they see as their inquisitors.The attack directed against censorship and the limitation of free speech is powerful, very sharp and single-mindedly focused on this single aspect. He does not take into consideration the difference between verbally abusing a person and dismantling that person's ideas or beliefs with arguments. However, he does make a distinction, in the afterword, between verbal attacks on abstract thing, which he sais are grouped by Karl Popper in World Three, and other types of attacks, on feelings and persons.This book makes a compelling argument of favour of liberalism, and a reminder of the dangers which lurk behind any intention of limiting it.

His title is partly inapt. For one, the reference to the Inquisition correctly points to the quasi-religious fanaticism of these various zealots, but there is nothing at all kindly about these fanatics who regularly resort to threats - even overt acts - of force and violence. More, his argument is less focused on these inquisitors than on defining and defending the revolutionary system of \"liberal science\" that these inquisitors are bent on undermining and destroying. In defining this modern liberal social system, Rauch (undoubtedly unawares) inverts the Straussian narrative of a declension from the philosophic virtue of the ancients to the low and base world of the moderns. Rauch's arch-enemy and archetypal foe is Plato, whom Rauch identifies as the original totalitarian, a would-be philosopher King who endorsed force and fraud as foundations for his utopian system. Giving Socrates his due as a model of (proto-liberal) intellectual humility, Rauch appreciates the temptations of the Platonic utopian ideal, but presents that utopian vision as being built on the false presumption that there is a Truth that the human mind can access. As Rauch puts it, \"Diversity, of belief, thought, opinion, experience, is a fact, like it or not.\" Whereas a Plato - and various fundamentalists and totalitarians since - sought to remove diversity of thought, along with the social strife which accompanies diversity, Rauch sees the liberal social system as grounded in the acceptance of a multiplicity and diversity of perspectives as an inescapable feature of human society. Departing from Plato, and tracing through the modern skepticism of Descartes, Montaigne, and Hume, Rauch identifies a connecting thread that he defines as the principle of \"public criticism\". This means that no one gets the final say on any matter, and no one has personal authority. Put differently, this principle accepts the skeptic's despondency at knowing the inability of knowing, and asserts that henceforth anything worthy of being called knowledge must be tested publicly. Rauch rightly sees this principle as radical (and democratic) in nature. He unpacks the revolutionary character of this principle in the (again) inaptly named chapter \"The Politics of Liberal Science\". This chapter addresses the theme of \"'order without authority' [which] might be taken as the motto both of political liberalism and of science.\" And though he points to Locke's political project - including the principles of consent, constitutionalism, and toleration - he leaves that political project aside, contending that \"the most intimate connection between members of the liberal constellation is also the least appreciated: the connection between democracy and science.\" He points also to markets here but does not develop the connection, content to argue that in addition to modern institutions of political liberalism and capitalism, both of which operate on the principles of public criticism, there is also the institution of liberal science, which is not simply our way of producing academic research but is our way of producing useful social knowledge. He presents liberal science as a \"game\" or an activity bounded by the rules of public criticism. Though he does discuss scientific activity in the academic world his interest is more in terms of political culture. Against \"fundamentalist\" and \"humanitarian\" challenges - the former of which (to put words in his mouth) asserts an objective Truth, and the latter of which asserts the inviolable Truth of subjectivity - Rauch argues, \"The genius of liberal science lies not in doing away with dogma and prejudice; it lies in /channeling/ dogma and prejudice - making them socially productive.\" Continuing, Rauch argues \"Biases and prejudices make us human and give us sparkle to our minds. What is to be condemned is not bias but /unchecked/ bias. The point of liberal science is not to be unprejudiced (which is impossible); the point is to recognize that your own bias might be wrong and submit it to public checking by people who believe differently.\"Against fundamentalists, Rauch rejects the notion that the liberal mode of knowing must grant equal time to every belief. Not simply is that impossible, it rejects the principle of public criticism, which may allow personal beliefs (conscience) to exist unmolested but which expects claims of knowledge to pass through stringent critique and examination. Against humanitarians - those who assert the inviolability of individual feelings against human prejudices and biases - Rauch says, in effect, toughen up. Words may indeed wound, but they do not wound like bullets do. Humanitarian critics of the liberal intellectual system must acknowledge the advantages that system brings, and reject the temptation to deny the biases of others - or impose their own prejudices - by force. That way leads to totalitarianism. Rauch's book is both energizing and frustrating. It offers a zealous defense of an intellectual position that rejects zealotry. At the same time, it feels as if it were written in a polemicist's haste and not with the length or precision that the topic deserves. In particular, it doesn't disentangle some of the differences between the liberal intellectual system and the liberal economic and political systems, especially with regard to the types of expertise that are necessary to enter academic scientific fields as compared to the negligible barriers to entry into democratic citizenship and into the marketplace. It also overlooks any particularly American or Madisonian contributions to this intellectual system. Rauch wants to go beyond constitutionalism to epistemology, but he overlooks opportunities to present a uniquely democratic and American response to the problem of who can rule and who can possess authoritative knowledge. But this is an important book, which deserves to be read by a broad audience."}, {"userName": "Noah Graham", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57539558-noah-graham", "userReview": "I can't see the books market.

The author's contention is that efforts to create a public debate environment, where no one is offended and all views are given equal respect, are well-intentioned but very misguided. He argues convincingly that such efforts, which increasingly take the form of speech codes and various laws in Western civilization, serve only to stifle debate and prevent certain ideas from receiving rigorous scrutiny.Here is a particularly potent passage that nicely captures the essence of the book:Somehow the idea has grown up that \"liberal\" means \"nice\", that the liberal intellectual system fosters sensitivity, toleration, self-esteem, the rejection of prejudice and bias. That impression is misguided. The truth is that liberal science demands discipline as well as license, and to those who reject or flout its rules, it can be cruel. It excludes and restricts as well as tolerates. It thrives on prejudice no less than on cool detachment. It does not give a damn about your feelings and happily tramples them in the name of finding truth. It allows and--here we should be honest--sometimes encourages offense. Self-esteem, sensitivity, respect for others' beliefs, renunciation of prejudice are all good as far as they go. But as primary social goals they are incompatible with the peaceful and productive advancement of human knowledge. To advance knowledge, we must all sometimes suffer. Worse than that, we must inflict suffering on others.In this regard, the author has much in common with John Stuart Mill. The only weakness of the book is that the author could have conducted a more detailed documentation of how efforts to stifle speech are manifesting themselves in the U.S. and provide an assessment of whether these efforts have gotten worse, since he first published the book back in 1993."}, {"userName": "Sharad Pandian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28777221-sharad-pandian", "userReview": "It's a 200 pages of fairly dull arguments that present a binary choice: either you support the system of \"liberal science,\" marked by equal standing and a critical stance, or you oppose it. While Rauch's use of history makes it a good read, the actual analysis and argument tend to rely on hand-wavy generalizations and buzzwords. For instance, he points out that to be a good liberal is to admit to fallibilism, the stance that we can always be wrong. But he doesn't quite address the tension this creates: If I believe something and am a liberal, how can I hold that something is true? How serious should I take the idea that I could be wrong? Without delving into the specifics about this, the account seems to provide more buzzwords than substance.The book isn't without its moments of insight, especially when Rauch draws on his own experience of being gay and Jewish to talk about related issues (like hate speech and holocaust denial), but apart from these the book comes off largely as but sterile."}, {"userName": "Martin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5717592-martin", "userReview": "A very smart friend told me to read this book.

Namely, he seeks to prove that liberal science is the best way to advance knowledge.
