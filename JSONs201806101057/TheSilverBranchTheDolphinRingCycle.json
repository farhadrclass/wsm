In Song For A Dark Queen, it's narrated by the queen's harper, not one of her warriors or a member of her family or the queen herself. And within the context of the narrative, that makes perfect sense, but it's a slightly unexpected choice. In The Eagle Of The Ninth, the protagonist is lame in one leg because of an injury, and therefore struggles with chronic pain despite the fact it is almost healed. And here, the protagonist is an anxious, sickly surgeon (he wasn't healthy enough to be a soldier) with a stutter that gets worse when he's nervous.It makes a change. It really does. And it also makes sense, reading the author bio of Sutcliff at the end of the novel which highlights the fact she was in a wheelchair for most of her life, affected by Still's disease.I've spent most of my life hale and healthy, until recently. Unfortunately, long-term health issues got a lot worse and I've been kind of limited in what I could do the last year or so. I'm also anxious and prone to panic attacks and nervous breakdowns. A lot of the time, these limitations massively affect my mood. But they also impact my reading taste, because why would I want to read about strong, athletic characters saving the world / their family when I could read about disabled or injured characters doing the same thing by overcoming their difficulties and playing their strengths? I imagine it was a similar attitude that prompted Sutcliff to make those decisions about her characters, and I'm sincerely grateful for it. It's refreshing to read a historical novel where the sickly or injured character isn't confined to their room while dashing young soldiers go around filling the plot criteria, perhaps out of pity or love for their fallen comrade. It's refreshing to read about somebody waking up with chronic pain in their leg and pushing through it to achieve something that most people thought was impossible, or struggling to communicate because of their nervousness but working through it to build friendships and alliances.Sometimes Sutcliff's style isn't the easiest, and I always feel slightly lost for the first couple of chapters of her books as I try and adjust to the setting which is often very intense and a little bit difficult to understand (and I'm far older than the target audience of these books). This one was no exception, though that might have been because I haven't read anything in a few weeks due to a heavy workload from school, and I wasn't in the swing of it. But the story, especially how it linked so cleverly and carefully with the earlier book, The Eagle Of The Ninth, made it worth it. And I've already mentioned what I like so much about her protagonists. So not the easiest read I've ever picked up from the children's shelves in the library and there's definitely no reason that it should be limited to that age group -- the writing and language is sophisticated, the characters are young but grown up, rather than being adolescents or children, and I'm sure it would appeal just as much to others my age (18) as to the ten-year-olds who frequent the children's section.In future, I won't let myself be embarrassed when I check out those books."}, {"userName": "Tijana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35343816-tijana", "userReview": "Srebrna grana je vrlo solidan istorijski roman za decu koji se bavi onim istorijskim trenutkom kad se Rimsko carstvo ve\u0107 malo ljulja ali jo\u0161 nije po\u010delo sasvim da se raspada (tako, tre\u0107i vek).

There are many reasons why, and I could go on forever about all of them. Instead, I'll jump between a few representative highlights of some elements I appreciate most. My favorite part of this book is most definitely the characters. Flavius and Justin, especially, but also each of their friends - from strange little Cullen to tall and fabulous Evicatos of the Spear, from the great little Emperor to the inimitable Aunt Honoria. Even the villains and other evil characters are so well-written - realistic, believable, dastardly, complex, and never cliche - and the main villain and his henchmen are possibly the very best antagonists I've ever read in my life. I could go on for ages and ages about what I love about each of the heroes, but I'll focus on just a few prominent things - though be assured there are many more than these.I love Flavius and Justin's character qualities - their incredible strength, goodness, commitment, loyalty, sense of duty, kindness, leadership, and courage. I love their good-natured, friendly, cheerful, and witty dispositions - Flavius in his fiery, bright way, and Justin in his own quiet, steady way. I love their close and brotherly friendship and the way they stick by each other, fighting alongside one another, through thick and thin. I identify with their loneliness and rejoice that they found each other and each gained a close companion who is much more than merely a friend or kinsman. I love stories of cousins, and there aren't enough in the world - and this is arguably my favorite one.I love Flavius's great leadership, and Justin's as well - equally admirable in both although and because it comes easily to Flavius but not to Justin. Flavius is strong and valiant and is the first in every attack and the last in every retreat, as is Justin. Both of them are always with their men in the most dangerous place, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the rest and rallying them on to victory or defeat. I love Flavius's immense and laughter-ridden pride in his men, whether his cohort, his band of spies, or his motley, tattered \"legion.\" I love the way he cares for his men as individuals like only a good leader can. There's a reason his men would follow him to the earth's end and back and through any battle or risk of death. I love that Justin is a surgeon and a healer in every way - in title, heart, hands, mind, and very being. He's committed to doing his work to the best of his ability, and he always, always puts his medical duty and his patients first. He has incredible compassion, empathy, kindness, and care for people, and he has eyes to truly, deeply see them and a heart that cares and helps others. I love how he carries his surgical instrument case through everything he goes through, even beyond the seeming end of the world he knows. Without him ever saying so, the value he places on his career and his skill to live it out are vividly apparent in his every thought and action. I love that he's not strong in body but never lets that stop him. He was sickly as a child - part of what gave him his desire to be a surgeon - and he doesn't have physical strength or stamina, but he pushes on anyway, every bit as much as Flavius, and he never bows out of the fight. I identify with Justin so much - his identity as a healer and medical professional (though I'm not one quite yet); his insecurities, his feeling of not being good enough, and his low self-esteem; his compassion, empathy, kindness, and care; his desire and ability to help and heal others; and much more. I'm a tall, reasonably pretty female, and he's the opposite, but I recognize my heart and being in him. I love this book's depiction of courage throughout, and it's one of my many favorite things about the characters and themes of The Silver Branch. Several of the characters exemplify this quality, and not just the two main heroes. Paulinus likes comfort and is timid and not at all adventurous, yet he risks mortal danger daily to fight for what he believes is right and save countless lives. Justin and Flavius know the danger, like Paulinus, and they at first do not want to join him in this task, but they can't help it in the end - their goodness and sense of justice win over their fear. They repeatedly make the difficult choice to continue Paulinus's work even when they could more easily refuse. And even before that, everything Justin and Flavius do speaks of their courage and refusal to do anything but what is right. They risk their lives to twice warn the emperor, to do Paulinus's work, and to fight in desperate battle to save the townspeople, the province, and countless individuals. Then there's Anthonius, who risks his own life to bodily defend the weak and helpless - and suffers the dangerous consequences for doing so. Then, after seeing the horrific danger first-hand, he makes the same courageous choice as Justin and Flavius - because he feels what they're doing is right and good. He also risks persecution for his faith but follows his Christ anyway, and I admire that as well - and I hope and trust that I would do the same. Their friends and comrades show courage as well as they fight alongside them. Each of these men, and others as well, risk death and terrible danger to fight for what's right - to fight corruption, wickedness, oppression, and darkness with light, justice, humanity, and kindness. That takes immense courage. These men stand up for what is right against overwhelming evil when most others want simply to stay safe and survive. To me, thought they are fictional, they represent real people throughout history and the world who have risked their lives to faithfully fight for what is right and true in the face of great danger and evil. I love how extremely vivid and powerful the scenes and settings of The Silver Branch are. The pulsing tension of dark shadow shot with red flame; the pure beauty of marshes and birdsong, grassy hills and clouded skies; the soft, warm, golden lamplight; the bustling, colorful crowds and deserted natural expanses. I love that Justin has an eye for small but significant details about people, places, and events. He truly sees things and people, and he thinks deeply about them. It shows in the few important details that are described in his narrative, details that have far, far deeper significance than they seem to have on the surface: a precious apple-tree, a half-finished chess game, a crimson \"rose for the arena,\" Justin's instrument case, a battered gold eagle standard, a half-eaten radish, a leaf-bladed spear ringed with dangling white feathers, a sprig of rye grass, a green-painted dolphin sign, a faraway beacon gleaming red in the night, a country farm, a singed and crushed moth, a silver branch of tinkling bells, a green flawed emerald ring. And I could go on for even longer about the small vivid details that make each and every character incredibly real, alive, and human. These small details of people make the main and minor characters of Sutcliff and especially The Silver Branch the most lifelike characters I've ever read. They come to life in vivid relief with only a few descriptive details, and I can see every feature and movement of each person, which is rare for me. I love that this book includes such wonderful female characters. Though they are on the page for much less time than the boys, they're all the more potent, vivid, and strong for that, since they're no less compelling than any of the men. Aunt Honoria is the most prominent and wonderful woman in this book, and she shines gloriously beside Flavius and Justin throughout. Aunt Honoria is amazing, and I adore her, admire her, and hope I become half the woman she is. She always keeps her cool and poise even in the most harrowing of situations - which is ironically the only time we see her - and rises to every challenge. I love her vivaciousness, her crooked but fabulous make-up, her generosity, her unique and lovely voice and laughter, her affectionate care for her nephews, her youth despite her age, her courage, and her immense strength of character. Other female characters appear for a total of only a few pages each, but they are themselves vivid, wonderful, and admirable. Vast and motherly Volumnia, the delicate and fragile \"girl like a pale flower\" who shows great courage and steadiness, and Manlius's courageous wife and other unnamed women who aid the heroes in their fight. I even love that romance is technically non-existent in this book - but I also love that there's still a barely perceptible hint of what may happen in the future, which I earnestly hope and believe must certainly take place someday. I love the ending of this book. It's so perfectly bittersweet, and full of joy and tragedy, and it looks back on all the joys and sorrows of the rest of the book - battles and friends won and lost, hardships endured, victories and struggles. The final desperate battle is intense, heart-wrenching, and glorious. And I love how even though the heroes' fight has ended, they are given a new beginning and hope after it all. I highly, highly recommend The Silver Branch to all readers of historical or adventure - and to any reader of any genre who loves compelling characters, suspenseful plots, and deep and beautiful writing."}, {"userName": "Maureen E", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/984514-maureen-e", "userReview": "Up until very recently I was unaware that Eagle of the Ninth, one of my all-time favorite Sutcliff books had a sequel. This is not the first time something like this has happened to me, and it's very demoralizing. Anyway, I made haste and got out The Silver Branch to read immediately. And then it sat in my To Be Read pile for ages until I made myself read it because I had to return it. Well, made myself read it isn't quite the right phrase, because I enjoyed every minute of it (except when a certain character died, which was very traumatic--two certain characters, I suppose).I've read enough Sutcliffs by now that I can pick up the thread. Rutupiae light, for example, is only briefly mentioned in this book, but anyone who's read The Lantern Bearers (LOVE, LOVE, LOVE) will know how important it is there. Similarly, there's the familiar old flawed stone with the dolphin carved in it. This book is a bit different from most of Sutcliff's though, in that it arguably has two main characters.Justin (Tiberius Lucius Justinianus) has just been posted to Roman Britain as a surgeon to the Eagles who are supporting Carausius, the self-styled Emperor of Britain. He's excited because his family was originally from Britain. On his first day there he falls in with a young centurion about his age who turns out to be a cousin of his (Flauvius). And, as it further turns out, they are both descendants of Marcus Flavius Aquila, of Eagle of the Ninth fame (YAY!).This being a Sutcliff novel, naturally they run into quite a bit of trouble. While I like Flauvius, Justin became the real hero of the novel for me. I think that's what Sutcliff intended (most of it is told primarily from his point of view), and it worked.This is highly recommended for almost all ages (her prose is occasionally difficult). No bad content, except for a bit of violence.Quotes:\"And above him towered the ramparts of Rutupiae: a grey prow of ramparts raw with newness, from the midst of which sprang the beacon-crested tower of the Light.\" (Okay, so I wrote that down solely for the Lantern Bearers reference. I love that book. I can't help it.)\"[Justin] was a friendly soul himself, but he was always gratefully surprised at any sign of friendliness from other people, and with his gratitude, his liking went out, hesitant but warm, to the red-headed centurion [Flauvius].\"\"Here we are on the run, with the hunt up behind us and the world falling into shards around our ears and you bring your instrument-case away with you.\"\"The young Centurion, who had been completely still throughout, said very softly, as though to himself, 'Greater love hath no man--' and Justin thought it sounded as though he were quoting someone else.\""}, {"userName": "Abigail Hartman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2272332-abigail-hartman", "userReview": "I cannot quite tell if this ties with \"The Eagle of the Ninth\" or comes in as a close second, but either way, it is a wonderful story. As with \"The Eagle of the Ninth,\" Sutcliff has an amazing knack for showing emotion in the little things of the story, and for sweeping the reader off to yesteryear. Justin and Flavius are spectacular, and the smattering of lesser characters are each unique - Evicatos of the Spear, Aunt Honoria, Centurian Anthonius, Cullen the Fool, Paulinus, and, larger than life, Carausius."}, {"userName": "Nigel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5020684-nigel", "userReview": "Well, the annoying thing about this book was the spoilers contained in the blurb, two on the back cover and another one on the page inside the front cover, giving away two major turning points in the book and effectively telling us something that doesn't happen until the last act, though it is the point the book has been building up to. It doesn't spoil the book by any means but it does nail down the direction of the book for you before you've even picked it up. The first spoiled turning point doesn't occur until about 100 pages in, for God's sake. Anyway, The Silver branch, sequel to Eagle Of The Ninth, set a generation later, recounts the adventures of Justin and Flavius, young Roman officers posted to Britain where Carausias has proclaimed himself Emperor. Once a river-pilot, he rose to command the Roman fleet and absconded with it to Britain and overthrew the Governor. Now he's a valuable ally of the much-weakened Roman Empire against encroaching barbarians and sea-wolves and plans to strengthen Britain to the point where it can withstand the impending fall of Rome.Justin and Flavius, good-hearted and good-natured youths, chance on a treacherous meeting while hunting on the coast. Reporting what they witnised, however, leads to an unexpected outcome. What follows is a tale of loyalty and betrayal, a stirring adventure that builds to a fiery climax under the battered and tarnished Eagle of the lost Ninth Legion.Absolutely marvelous stuff. Sutcliff was the mistress of historical adventures, concealing a sophisticated understanding of the ancient world and its history under a deceptively simple and straightforward style of storytelling. The story twists and turns and runs its own course, and it helps if the sodding copywriter hasn't given any of the various twists and turns away."}, {"userName": "Angela R.

I adore the ties between this and The Eagle - I imagine Marcus would've been proud to see the use his eagle was put to. Justin's relationship with his father felt very real to me, too. Neither of them are really in the wrong, they're just *really awkward*. Bless. As ever, Sutcliff writes beautifully, and does a brilliant job of creating people with utterly different mindsets who somehow work together. The historical details are gorgeous too - the Christian soldier testing out Justin and Flavius with the fish drawing stood out in particular. It's not heavy handed, it's not 'Oh, look at how much I know about this period!', it's just utterly, utterly immersive.In most books with nigh-impossible tasks to be achieved, you can be pretty sure the heroes will win through somehow, but with Sutcliff you can never be sure (The Shining Company, for example).

I was not disappointed.I'll let others describe the book; here I'll describe my reaction to it. I enjoyed it. It's not great literature, but it's solid literature and Sutcliff had a good eye and ear for historical matters. One doesn't learn history in any formal way, but one does imbibe it, rather as a tourist imbibes something of a culture even on a bus tour. I don't know why I associate Sutcliff's work with Young Adult; perhaps it's because that's when I read her. She doesn't specifically write about teens, and she certainly doesn't dumb down her writing. Maybe it's because her books have such a strong element of adventure in them.

All the while they build up a rogue Legion of their own, making for their standard a mysterious, wingless Eagle whose history lies in shadow, a glory of past days to lead them on to future triumph. As with every piece of Romano-British historical fiction of Sutcliff's which I have read, though definitely with twists of her own added, the author brings the setting to life in such a captivating way as to make that ancient time as real to the reader as the chair in which he sits.

Mystery and the unexpected is something missing in the book coming to think of it. You immediately know the good guys and the bad ones(seriously, the hero sees a guy killing a bug and immediately understands he's a very evil guy and his main opponent). You also know the outcome because, duh, it's history. No real plot twists and apart from a an incident where the hero is trapped there isn't much of a thrill.

Lots of strange characters developed from small historical facts, which I found interesting."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5433361-linda", "userReview": "This well-written Young Adult novel is set in late third-century Britain and is based on actual events. It centers on two young Romans named Flavius and Justin, who are coincidentally posted to the same fort and then discover that they are distantly related. The battles are depicted fairly realistically, for a YA book, but there are also moments of humor and genuine friendship among the main characters.(This is a sequel to The Eagle of the Ninth and the second volume of the Roman Britain trilogy.)"}, {"userName": "Rosemary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133127-rosemary", "userReview": "This book fits in between The Eagle of the Ninth and The Lantern Bearers -- about 100+ years on each side. I'm very loyal to Sutcliff, but this is not her best work. It has many of the same familiar elements (primeval natural setting, plot tracing the struggle to hold onto a humane civilization amid the power struggle of tyranny and anarchy) but the storyline doesn't have quite the emotional depth of something like Lantern Bearers or the utter magic of Flame-Colored Tafetta. It's overall a little too glibly symmetrical."}, {"userName": "Jamie (ReadsInTrees) Dacyczyn", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5407713-jamie-readsintrees-dacyczyn", "userReview": "Another well written installment in thus series. I'll admit that quite a bit if the subtle action bits were lost on me because I kind of rushed through this one a little because I was eager to begin rereading The Thief by MWT.
