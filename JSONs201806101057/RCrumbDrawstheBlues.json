Crumb panels of varying quality. But the overall effect is a fun one. The best one here is the first, his homage to the life of Delta bluesman Charley Patton, beautifully rendered. Almost of comparable quality is the story of jazzman Jelly Roll Morton's struggle with a career-damaging voodoo curse. Crumb's fondness for pre-war (WWII) country and blues records predominates the panels even when those are not the subjects of the strips. There are several pieces here that are outright screeds against modern music, and by \"modern\" he means all the way back to swing music, though his venom is especially directed at rock and pop since the 1960s. There are some surreal off-the-cuff doodlings here. They almost seem like filler but provide a refreshing view of Crumb's freewheeling stream-of-consciousness humor. Some of the panels involving rural black folk will probably offend some, though Crumb seems to speak truth in his down and dirty and honest depictions of harsh rural life. The story about Tommy Grady might be one of these, though it's a fascinating account of how an obscure country bluesman left the farm, cut a few sides in Memphis, was immediately shot by a jealous husband, and forgotten for decades, his few remaining records rotting away in attics until their rediscovery by white record enthusiasts in the 1970s.This is a fast read. The Patton story is probably really the only essential work here, but it's all worth a look."}, {"userName": "Matti Karjalainen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5721271-matti-karjalainen", "userReview": "Amerikkalaisen underground-legendan Robert Crumbin musiikkiaiheisia sarjakuvia yhteen kokoavassa albumissa \"Blues\" (Like, 1993) kerrotaan muun muassa Charley Pattonin el\u00e4m\u00e4tarina, pohdiskellaan vaikuttivatko jazzmuusikko Jelly Roll Mortonin ymp\u00e4rill\u00e4 saatanalliset voodoo-voimat, harmitellaan isovanhempiemme kauniin musiikin katoamista ja kuvitetaan \"Purple Hazen\" kaltaisia lauluja.

I somehow completely missed them when I lived in America. I found more British, Welsh, Scottish and Irish that knew more American history than most Americans I've met (no matter what country I live in.)A copy of this was being passed around the homeless community in Bath about 2003, of which I was a member. One of Crumb's best. It made me forget I was homeless. Yes, Crumb can be vicious at times but he is always an equal opportunity destroyer.If you've been reading a bunch of rock history books or biographies of rock music legends (and if not why not?) and may wonder at all of the references to American blues artists. Here is a great way to get a crash course in the blues (crash being the operative word.)"}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628526-patrick", "userReview": "This title is a bit of a misnomer. The book is barely about the blues. The section on Charley Patton has a couple interesting inaccuracies which makes it tough to swallow as a biography (for one it was his wife Bertha who tried to kill Patton by cutting his throat with a butcher knife- he survived and they stayed together, but he had a scar the rest of his life). And the story about Jelly Roll Morton is about his incredible encounter with Voodoo, not about his music. That being said, this book was great. Not to be missed are R.Crumb's struggles with contemporary music and his Cubist Be-Bop Comics."}, {"userName": "Artur Coelho", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3865852-artur-coelho", "userReview": "Apesar de indelevelmente conotado com a contra-cultura dos anos 60, Robert Crumb \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m um grande amante dos Blues.

It's far from being the best Crumb, but there's something about this book that I can't define but with the word \"pleasure\". Plus: one of my musical passions is early, pre-war blues. It's not just music, it's stories, visions. I never care about pure music. On my right arm I have tattooed the first drawing of this book, the face of Charlie Patton. To me it's more about storytelling than about music."}, {"userName": "Bert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922440-bert", "userReview": "Crumb's passion for folk music and Blues just oozes out of this book.
