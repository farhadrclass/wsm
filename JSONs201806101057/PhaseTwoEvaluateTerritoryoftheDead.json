Apparently zombies aint the only thing Tabitha needs to worry about now. She finds way scarier monsters that are going bump in the night desperately looking for their next meal. As it is, Tabitha is starting to get fed up with being pushed around by the men around her, she's starting to become snappy in this book. Even though it takes a few chapters she's quickly starting to become more confrontational and she's now certain she wants to survive, that she can survive. It's cute seeing a love triangle in a zombie apocalypse, nothing like finally being noticed by the opposite sex while running from man eating corpses! I feel for Tabitha though, she doesn't fully understand that two different men are totally falling for her, because she hasn't any boyfriend experience. She's also trying to avoid said men and her feelings for them, she knows how dangerous that can be. I'm dying to know what's gonna happen next! This was another awesome book by Wynters, and even more impressive that it's technically a Young adult/New Adult book. It doesn't really read like one though, which really makes it stand out for this genre."}, {"userName": "Dena", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6071893-dena", "userReview": "The characters are puzzling and the plot thickens. Tabitha is a very shallow character and even when she introspects she still is long winded and seems ignorant. I know she is supposed to be naive but really she's not. I am interested to find out more."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28090823-tara", "userReview": "The reason this one got three stars and not four is purely Tabitha's fault. I can only take so much stupid and annoying and naive for so long. I guess what makes it worse is that she puts herself on a pedestal and thinks she is so mature and wise, and in reality she is a horrible bumbling moron."}, {"userName": "Lillian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24957390-lillian", "userReview": "Don't be afraid of your strengths. Use them, develop them, and never rely on others to keep you safe. -Kellan Phase Two: Evaluate by Rose Wynters picks up three days after the events of the first book of this series. Tabitha, her parents, her only surviving neighbor Jayden, her best friend Amanda and her dad, and Sara, the woman they picked up on the side of the road, are all living as comfortably as could be in their situation in the mansion owned by the mysterious Kellan who rescued them from a horde of zombies at Tabitha's house. In this installment, Kellan is teaching them how to use weapons and survive. He takes a raiding party consisting of Tabitha, Jayden, and Amanda's dad back into town for supplies and that's where all the excitement begins in earnest. \n\"You did good today with your shots,\" I told him. It was an understatement. Jayden was a natural. He'd hit the bulls eye with each shot.\"Thanks,\" he replied dryly. \"Must be from all of the video games I played when I was younger.\"We both laughed, and it felt good. It was nice to think about something normal.\n Tabitha is an awesome main character. The entire story is told from her POV and I felt as if I was living things through her, experiencing what she does, and laughing out loud at her inner thoughts. Jayden is your cute next door neighbor that you never had the guts to talk to, but now find you're all of a sudden not just talking, but friends because of a zombie apocalypse....at least that's how it is for Tabitha. I loved reading the progression of their relationship, however I smell a love triangle coming on. In just the first few pages of this novella, Kellan and Jayden are sizing each other up and trying to mark their territory (bad analogy but very true!). And this continues throughout the book, much to Tabitha's dismay. Kellan is such a mystery. No one knows who he is, why he had a mansion with all the supplies he has, or what he may or may not have known about this apocalypse. There's also an addition to their group, Drake. I will say nothing about Drake other than that he is a surprise and I'm not sure if I love this character or if I should be leery of him. I'll let you read and decide. I so love this series! It's funny, brings tears to my eyes, and makes you cherish all the little things (like having a working bathroom and going to a grocery store for food). After the initial raid in town, the plot jumps forward about three weeks and the rest of the story takes place then, a month after zombies destroyed their world. I will not spoil this story and tell anything other than I loved it, read it in one sitting, and am eagerly awaiting the next book! If you enjoy horror without too much gore, suspense, irony and YA lit, check it out!"}, {"userName": "Leanne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28015536-leanne", "userReview": "WOW!... If Rose Wynters was looking to keep you on your toes then she has certainly done it with this 2nd book of the series.Truth be told I honestly thought that this series was going to be like the T.V program \"The Walking Dead\" with a little romance, now I love watching The Walking Dead, but this series by Miss Wynters...(I'm gonna have to do this, so please forgive me. lol) O . M . G !! I just cant get enough. Talk about keeping you on your toes and at the edge of your seat. Not only do we have the zombies, but we've got other things that go bump in the night.As for Kellan the jury is still out on that, all I know is he's definitely not 100% human. ( I think. Or that could just be the p.n.r geek in me thinking/hoping that! lol)And the way Rose Wynters describes both Kellan and Jayden it certainly doesn't take you too long on imagining how these 2 fine specimens look like, and oh my!...Its nice to see that Tabitha is starting to grow a little and is even starting to think, even though she is still struggling with how the new world is. And I'm certain there's a budding romance between her and Jayden, and even Kellan is showing interest even if it's with only grunts and dirty looks towards Jayden. But bless Tabitha and her innocence she doesn't see or understand the way Kellan is acting.I'm not going to go into the storyline cause I have a knack of giving away too many spoilers, but I really do recommend that you read this series, and yes you will have to read in series order. Considering this is classed as a Y.A it doesn't read like one.I cant wait to get my teeth into book 3, and hopefully will be that little closer to find more about the sexy Mr Kellan. If I could, I would have definitely well and truly given it more than the five stars allowed."}, {"userName": "Lori Franklin Hopkins", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28093908-lori-franklin-hopkins", "userReview": "I was given the opportunity to read this for free in exchange for an honest review from librarything.com.Going into this book, I had not read any of Ms. Wynter's work before. I was immediately sucked in! I like Tabitha, sort of, but sometimes she irritates me, I cannot put my finger on it. It could be that she is a typical teenager, sometimes overreacting to things, other times not acting at all. I am sure I was the same way at her age, very indecisive about everything. She is growing on me, though.I was also sent a copy of the second book, thank God, or I would have gone stir crazy trying to figure out what happened next. But it still isn't enough! I WANT MORE!!!I cannot tell you what was unveiled in the second book, because I don't like spoilers, but if you are a person that likes romance, horror, and paranormal in your books, you need to pick this one up!!!"}, {"userName": "LadiesMan217", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21219279-ladiesman217", "userReview": "It's fascinating how a writer can hate her leading lady so much. It is the only explanation for why Tabitha is so  incredibly stupid.  She just learned that zombies, aliens, vampires and werewolves are real, and all she can think about it who's kiss she likes the best.

Eighteen-year-old Tabitha Alexander is struggling to adapt to the new world she's living in. The zombies are everywhere, and nothing living is safe from them. They exist for only one purpose. To consume those still left alive. They find safety in Kellan's home, or so they believe. The secrets are mounting, though, and each day seems to reveal only more questions. On a mission to seek answers, they find themselves trapped deep within the Louisiana forests. In a deserted shack next to the bayou, Tabitha discovers that the nightmare is just beginning. They haven't seen the worst of the zombies apocalypse. Not by a long shot. They escape, back to the safety of the compound. But it's only an illusion. Tabitha quickly realizes that zombies aren't the only monsters in the world... And humans have just dropped even further on the food chain.

Excerpt: I squinted down the barrel of the rifle as I held it tightly in my sweaty palms. It seemed extraordinarily long to me, the weight heavy in my stiff clasp. The afternoon sun beat down on my head and shoulders. It was hell. The stuffed scarecrow target erected several feet away wavered in the sunlight like a mirage in a desert. The combination of nerves and heat was wearing me down. I blinked rapidly, trying to clear my vision. It didn't help. \u201cAny day now,\u201d Kellan muttered impatiently, standing a few feet away. He was staring at me intensely, but his eyes and expression revealed nothing. \u201cJust line the sight up on the scarecrow and pull the trigger.\u201d Yeah, he made it sound so easy. Kellan was half the reason I was so nervous.... And so hot. Something about the way he looked at me made me extremely flustered. Being in his presence for three days hadn't helped that any. \u201cOkay,\u201d I replied, feeling completely inept and embarrassed. We were standing in a field next to his home, or compound, as I liked to call it. He'd brought all of us out the hour before to work on shooting and target practice. Everyone else, including my mom, seemed to take right to it. I was the only one having problems. Kellan cleared his throat. Inhaling deeply, I pointed the tip of the rifle in the direction of the scarecrow and squeezed the trigger. My body wasn't expecting the recoil. It shocked me badly, and in response, I swung around in surprise... And so did the rifle. Horrified moans and gasps filled the air, at least from everyone but Kellan. He muttered a harsh expletive as he shook his head exasperatedly. I had to give them all credit, though. Even my dad moved fast in the face of imminent disaster. Kellan reached out and grabbed the rifle as I immediately blushed and rubbed at my shoulder. It didn't really hurt, but it gave me something to do. \u201cSorry, everyone,\u201d I finally choked out, completely mortified as I looked down at the ground. Could anyone be a worse shot than me? \u201cIt's okay, Tabs,\u201d Dad replied, but his normally ruddy complexion had paled considerably. He exchanged a long look with my mom before looking back at me. \u201cI'm sure with a little more practice you'll be shooting like a pro.\u201d It didn't escape my notice that his reassurances sounded a tad puny. I nodded weakly in response.", "title": "Phase Two: Evaluate\n      \n          (Territory of the Dead #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22083883-phase-two", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400034125l/22083883.jpg", "reviews": 10, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7033186.Rose_Wynters", "name": "Rose Wynters"}], "type": ["Horror", "Young Adult", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22083883-phase-two", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23903567-phase-two", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19154990-my-wolf-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17903004-phase-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18392983-my-wolf-protector", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17732928-rubenesque-rapture", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23002877-my-wolf-fighter"]}
