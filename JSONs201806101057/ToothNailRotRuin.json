This story quickly brings the reader up to speed on what has happened in the past year with Benny Imura and the gang from Mountainside as they train with Captain Ledger in Area 51. That's right - JOE Ledger. But even more of the Maberry-verse comes into play as the tale is paid out when we see more of the reapers from the Night Church stalk a caravan of traders, the leader is none-other-than Iron Mike Sweeney from the Pine Deep Trilogy - Maberry's first foray into fiction novels. Iron Mike's intro into the world of Benny is handled deftly and his place and past history not shoe-horned in as when other authors have brought their past creations into their current fiction. I'll save the spoilers, but even knowing that Mr. Sweeney was in the story going in the appearance was so amazingly well paid off as I read it, I wanted to stop then and there and re-read it. Definite \"Squee!\" moments, folks. Just like all the shorts that Maberry seeds between his major tales, these are continuity movers that aren't required-reading for the folks that only buy the books to understand and get, as Maberry does a great jobs in the novels proper but the background detail they paint is not to be missed."}, {"userName": "Aaron Advani", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7969398-aaron-advani", "userReview": "Another brilliant addition to the Rot & Ruin series, Jonathan Maberry just gets better and better"}, {"userName": "TG KMT | QUESTL\u2765VE", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8020367-tg-kmt-questl-ve", "userReview": "Iron Mike.
