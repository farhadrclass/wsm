There was a moment on Sunday when the urge to throw it across the room and be done with it forever was so strong I had to clench my hands around the spine to keep myself from doing it. This was made more imperative by the fact that I was standing outside in a bus terminal at the time, and this was a library book.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

I'd liken Lorrie Moore to a cross between Zo\u00eb Heller and Lionel Shriver; this novel is insightful, comic, thought-provoking and tragic; beautifully rendered with some gorgeous turn of phrase. Tassie is a wonderfully touching character you come to love and admire; she's a twenty year old who, while being somewhat naive with guys, is also surprisingly mature about life. The story in a nutshell: Tassie moves from the family farm into Troy to attend college and gets herself a part-time job as a nanny to Mary-Emma, for Sarah and Edward. There's some real tragedy here including Tassie's brother's very short deployment to Afghanistan and Mary-Emma's adoption but also some beautifully warm moments; Tassie's relationship with her father and with Mary-Emma. My favorite part is Tassie donning her bird costume to scare the mice from her father's crops.I like the review of O, The Oprah Magazine which says \"A miracle of lyric force, beautiful and beautifully constucted, with a comic touch that transforms itself to a kind of harrowing precision\".I am so impressed with Martin's work. My one criticism; not long enough, I could have easily read another 150 pages of this exceptional novel. 4\u2605"}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1856914-lauren", "userReview": "The end sequence took hold of me. One hundred pages into it, I hated this book. The last twenty pages actually seemed like something that might happen, and it resonnated with somethings happening in my life. Moore is out of her league her, writing about things that she does not know. Loorie Moore is 52. She has not been an undergraduate in college for 30 years and it showed in this book. When she used the band name Modest Mouse, it sounded clunky, fake, phony as my good friend Holden might say. I'm reminded of Charlotte Simmons (this was the first Tom Wolfe book I ever read and I will never read it again. It was insulting). On top of her inability to live the life of a 20-21 year old college student, she tries to tackle every topic out there. She passes over September 11th with a crude joke. Having lived in DC at the time, and being in college myself, I can say that I and my fellow classmates did not think it was very funny. I'm not sure anybody did. Scared as hell. Yes. Then, she has her protagonist in her German high school class drawing pictures of Hitler and panzer tanks (she seems to hark back to the Nazi era \"You may not be old enough, but you'll come to realize that the Nazis always win\".) What high school teacher lets that stuff fly? The older generation should know that they have no idea what happens in college these days, admit that they don\u2019t understand the humor, the nuance. I\u2019m not at all stating that its sophisticated in every aspect, or that there aren\u2019t shallow and idiotic individuals, but Moore and Wolfe just don\u2019t get it. The narrative was all over the place. The characters were unbelievable. The attempt at half-noir failed. I received an email from a proprietor of a bookstore claiming that this book was by far the best of the year. He obviously hasn\u2019t read anything else or is looking at this thing as the absurd."}, {"userName": "Josh Ang", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4870273-josh-ang", "userReview": "The problem with this book is that it has no centre. Moore can't decide if she wants it to be about the travails of 20-year-old Tassie who grapples with being a country girl thrown into the big city campus (alarm bells rang in my head at the pointedness of making her half-Jewish as well) or about the 40- something chef Sarah, with a mysterious past and who adopts a little girl of mixed race parentage. For a large part of the story, Sarah looms uncertainly as a close-to-central character, likeable in a loopy kind of way as she faces the big bad world of adoption protocols. But in the latter part of the novel, she disappears without a trace when some trouble arises regarding custody of her adopted daughter. Lest it be said that this novel is without a theme, Moore inserts interracial issues into the plot, albeit in a half-hearted fashion. These are dealt with in the weekly meetings that Sarah organizes in her home with racially-blended families who are grappling with the same issues of raising adopted kids. Like the reader, Tassie half-listens to the bits of arguments that float up the stairs into the children's room where she is babysitting the kid of these parents, occasionally scandalized and horrified by some of the more interesting nuggets randomly conjured up. Throw in Tassie's heady and unsteady relationship with a would-be-Brazilian classmate with a tell-tale prayer mat in his room and we have an over-deliberate attempt to draw a parallel between Sarah and her baby Mary Emma (or Emmie from her initials) on the one hand and Tassie and Reynaldo on the other and to exoticize the story. Occasionally funny, and with truly tragic bits that tug at the heartstrings (Sarah and her husband Edward's backstory about a bad parenting decision gone wrong still haunts me), the novel, however, is smaller than the sum of its parts. Tassie goes through her experiences more as an observer than a participant and one can't help feeling that she is a little disengaged even when she tries to explain her bond to the little Emmie and her employers. Even when she deals with a family loss, there is a sense Tassie goes through the mourning in a robotic must-feel-numb fashion. Part of the problem is that Moore does not quite get under the skin of a 20-year-old who is also a sometime guitarist. This musical aspect of her character seems to be more a stereotype rather than a defining character trait, and the clumsy references to it fails to give Tassie the person any more shape.Coming from an author who has churned out genre-defining short story collections like \"Self-Help\" and the brilliant \"Birds of America\", I can't help but feel a little shortchanged by this novel."}, {"userName": "Katy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1015919-katy", "userReview": "Some reviewers are responding to this novel much as I expected: \"Moore is too clever by half, the voice of her narrator is too mature, the plot is unbelievable.\" My response is that she IS too clever by half, and -- so what? The narrator has the voice of a 50-ish academic professor because  that is who is speaking ; she makes references to \"later I would find out,\" or \"another boyfriend would later tell me.\" As for the plot and its spotty verisimilitude, I would suggest that reviewers who suggest as much may not have grown up as a girl in the Midwest. Trust me, it's perfectly plausible to be directly affected by war overseas, become infatuated with swarthy, secretive lovers who are wholly inappropriate for you, nanny for white-liberal zealots with questionable backgrounds and/or ethics -- all during one's sophomore year! -- and view it all with a preternaturally wise, wry eye. In addition, her passages on the weather and the natural world are astoundingly poetic, her take on the harm done by passive complicity to gendered authority, the bizarreness of government and law over-ruling love and nature and family and motherhood are all pretty eloquent."}, {"userName": "E.J.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1937588-e-j", "userReview": "Try angsty, \"atmospheric\", and utterly self-indulgent, never mind the fact that it's too obvious that her editor must be illiterate.

And indeed from the first few sentences you had the feeling you were in the hands of a sure, masterful storyteller. But over the course of the novel it unraveled and became an inchoate mix of sophomoric polemic, coming-of-age story, carictaurish depictions of terrorists, and clever wordplay. The story's vehicle is Tassie, a 20-yr old college freshman who becomes a nanny for a wealthy, over-educated, white liberal couple who adopt an infant girl who is part African-American. It is best when it takes us on the journey of an open adoption, that too in a situation where the complication is not only the class and race issues of this particular adoption but the conflicts and emotional fractures of the adopting parents. The adoption story is in fact where the novel's heart lies, and where it is not only sweet and funny but heartbreakingly sad; the latter so much so that I had to put the put book aside at times. Along the way we get lots of biting comments on the class and social differences between the liberal college town where Tassie goes to school and her country roots. However all this gets buried in extraneous sub-plots: Tassie's infatuation with a classmate (wont give the spoiler here), her brother Robert's aimless stumbling into volunteering for duty in Afghanistan, and her ambivalent relationships with her parents. The worst sections are pages and pages where the politics of interracial adoption are debated by a group of parents whom Tassie listens to while babysitting -- a clumsy and transparent device for directly inserting polemic and social commentary into the novel without bothering to give them the clothing of character and plot. The continual wordplay by Tasie, her room-mate Murph, her brother and her father are wearing. Finally, like so many contemporary novels, the male characters are the worst and receive no compassion - the confused brother, the vain and selfish husband, the hopeless boyfriend, and so on. All in all, disappointing and not worth the effort."}, {"userName": "Glenn Sumi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi", "userReview": "Lorrie Moore takes on a lot \u2013 possibly too much \u2013 in her third novel: race, class, war and post-9/11 anxiety. But her sharp eye, beautifully attuned ear for language and wry sense of humour help the novel over even its roughest patches.It\u2019s the coming of age story of Midwestern college student Tassie Keltjin, who in the fall of 2001 takes on a part-time job as a nanny to help pay for school. Her employers are the 40-ish Sarah Brink, the liberal, highly strung chef and owner of a high-end French restaurant, and her mostly absent husband Edward, who\u2019s got a wicked silvery hairdo and a roving eye. Then there\u2019s their newly adopted African-American toddler Mary Emma, nicknamed Emmie (to stand for M.E.).Of course something significant happened in September 2011, but it\u2019s referred to obliquely, and has ramifications in Tassie\u2019s younger brother going to war and in one other plot point I won\u2019t mention. I\u2019ll just say that a feeling of unease and restlessness settles over most of the book \u2013 just think of the thin protection suggested by the title.Emmie\u2019s biracial background allows Moore to riff a lot on race, especially in a series of meetings in which parents of non-Caucasian children get to vent their frustrations once a week. There\u2019s clever, smart writing in these scenes, but they\u2019re also repetitive and monotonous.Moore has some problems with pacing and plot. A character can't pass a flower without describing it. And the author can\u2019t resist a play on a word, or some aren\u2019t-I-so-brilliant observation - coming out of anyone's mouth. Tassie\u2019s insights seem much more mature and worldly than that of a college-age woman who was raised on a farm \u2013 and if Moore intends the narrative to be from a woman looking back on her life (which would explain the maturity) it\u2019s not always successful.But line by line she is such a good writer, and there are images in the book of startling, haunting clarity and power. In her short stories, Moore\u2019s always been able to find the humour in pain and heartbreak, and she does so again here, except on a larger and more ambitious canvas."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/179064-amber", "userReview": "I love Lorrie Moore's writing. I love it so much that I spent my college years ripping her off (well, trying to anyway) in fiction writing workshops. Her short story collections rank high among my favorite books. But I've never fallen in love with any of her novels in the same way. All of those wonderful little moments of wry humor amidst sadness are there, but the structure of it just doesn't quite work for me. There's a bit with a college boyfriend who isn't what he appears that gets handled in a way that left me cringing. The couple Tassie's babysitting for, who also aren't what they appear, didn't quite ring true to me either. I still tore through it, and I still had those moments where I set the book down for a second because my breath was taken away, and that's tough to come by. I still love Moore's writing, but I couldn't help but be a bit disappointed in this novel."}, {"userName": "Jennie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/702266-jennie", "userReview": "I absolutely can not abide fiction that is meant to be realistic and then is written in a way that does not accurately reflect any kind of reality.

After reading a slew of terrible pop fiction I have decided to institute a 50 pages or 3 strikes rule before I quit a novel. Usually there are warning signs very early on that inspire me to toss the book aside but I ignore them and soldier on. No more.Strike 1: The main character's roommate passes her old vibrator on to her when she starts dating. Under no circumstances would this EVER happen.

I came to the conclusion that I really did not enjoy this, but I am hesitant to give it less than 3 stars.Moore has presented us with a coming of age story about a young lady, Tassie, from the mid-west who has entered a small undistinguished college a few hours from her home. There were amusing moments, there were scenes of passionate sex and even a finely described dining scene. Overall,the narration felt flat, dull and mostly aimless to me. There were a few exceptions that seemed to stand out. Tassie was engaged as the nanny to a bi-racial little girl. The interactions and the love between these two characters was a delight- joyful, almost palpable. The parents' self-involvement and shallow relationship with each other and people around them were difficult to absorb. Tassie, herself is a solitary, introspective person. Her own family seems remote, with the exception of her younger brother. Here we find again a softening and some pleasure in the characterization of Tassie.Perhaps I do not find this maturing- to- adulthood type of novel appealing, but I sense that this is not the reason for my lack of enjoyment. The narration seemed to meander, or just when it seemed ready to flesh out, it fell away to a void.I will read this author again at some point because I did feel the ability in her writing with some of her descriptive passages."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/623075-ed", "userReview": "I picked up Lorrie Moore's \"A Gate At The Stairs\" based on the many appearances it made on the best-of/year-end book lists for 2009. Although, while I do my best to avoid reading reviews beforehand, I couldn't help but notice the star-ratings were pretty muddy on it.While the book was readable, I felt there was just always something very odd/off about it. Some books you know are great from the first page (or even sentence!), but \"Gate\" had me still hanging when I sat down to finish it. Even with 30-40 pages left, I thought the book at the potential for an \"Aha! That's brilliant!\" moment/ending, but ultimately I compared it to a collapsed souffle. There's just too much thrown in here (and again, very (very!) odd stuff) that just isn't sufficiently dealt with. I know real life doesn't always provide closure - people come and go, weird things happen - but in a fictional world, I generally like it all to make more sense. This is a coming-of-age story, a post-9/11 tale, an adoption plot worthy of a Lifetime movie, mysterious pasts, a family comedy, a family tragedy, a romance, a commentary on race... and toss in a potato-farming father, a half-Jewish mother, Midwestern college courses in wine-tasting and war movie soundtracks (?!?), a Brazilian Muslim boyfriend, gourmet French food and a narrator with a knack for going off on the slightest tangent that can last for pages, and well it was all kind of a mess for me.Moore seems to have her fans and a fine reputation and I'd give the writing in this one a good 3.5/4 stars.

Moore is one of the most witty, entertaining and insightful prose stylists we have in contemporary fiction. She is also sharply observant of cultural insanities and inconsistencies. I loved the beginning of this novel! But about 2/3 of the way through, when the plot went haywire, I felt puzzled and disappointed. It felt like Moore didn't know how to shape this story and so started to throw in bizarre plot twists of the melodramatic variety (not her usual style!), literally one after another... When the story tried to come to a climax with the tragic death of a minor, completely undeveloped character who we had barely seen up to that point, I stopped caring and began to skim the book just to be done. Birds of America and Frog Hospital were masterpieces: I'm really surprised by this novel's lack of a meaningful, cohesive structure and truly puzzled by the critical accolades it received, from the Times and others... Sadly, it makes me cynical about the industry..."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/575599-jennifer", "userReview": "I so wanted to love this book, but....I just don't think it worked. I love Lorrie Moore and was so excited to see that she had a new novel. And the reviews! They have been great. But for me, the whole thing was a mess. The core story, in which a white family adopts a biracial baby, has potential. But the story is narrated not by anyone in that family, but, rather, by a college student who becomes their nanny. Not only was this character's voice not particularly authentic, but I couldn't figure out why she was the centerpiece. Furthermore, the twists and turns in this story are not-at-all believable.It seems that Moore wanted this book to say something big about America after 9-11. There are numerous bizarre subplots -- e.g. the nanny's brother goes off to war, and the nanny becomes involved with someone who is not as he seems -- which could have been short stories rather than components of this novel. Perhaps the disconnected feeling I had while reading was what the author intended, but still, it was a disappointing book."}, {"userName": "Patricia Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3078783-patricia-murphy", "userReview": "I love Lorrie Moore. And I liked this book. But I was talking to a writer-friend of mine, someone who has published & edited more books than most people have read, and I told him that when I got to page 200 or so of this book it \"jumped the shark.\" He asked, \"What does that mean?\" and I said \"I have no idea.\" Luckily John was in the next room and explained, \"It refers to a Happy Days episode where Fonzie water skis over a shark.\" There. It's true. There are several sections of dialogue in the center that are quite like the Fonz on water skis. And the scene of Reynaldo in his barren apartment reminds me of scenes from two other books: Nick Flynn's Suck City and Aimee Bender's The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake. Oh, and also the end of the movie St. Elmo's Fire with Demi Moore and Rob Lowe snuggling on the mattress. But here it has, oh, I don't know, a jihad flair. I wasn't convinced.I also said to my writer-friend that the reason I liked this book in particular and Moore in general is because she keeps writing sentences I wish I had written. Like many times per page. And it's true here. But sometimes the dialogue sang the same high note so often it seemed the singer might have no lower register. I enjoyed the complex plot, the smart narrator, and of course my favorite moment, perhaps representative of why I love LM, when the 20 year old narrator imagines: \"What if Sylvia Plath had married Langston Hughes.\" I've read reviews saying 20 year olds don't think that way. But I did at 20, and I still do at 40, and I believed this narrator most of the way around."}, {"userName": "Sara Batkie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/334035-sara-batkie", "userReview": "I read an uncorrected proof of this and the experience was slightly jarring - typoes, sections that repeated themselves that I wasn't sure were intentional, etc. I can't say how close my copy is to the final published version but what I read was what I've come to expect from Moore - it's funny, it's emotionally complex, the prose is easily readable while also remaining incredibly rich, and the narrative voice is compelling to follow. It details roughly one year in the life of Tassie Keltjin, a twenty year old college student who has recently taken a babysitting job for a family that has adopted a bi-racial child. The action unfolds in the midwest, in the wake of 9/11. The last thirty pages are some of the most stunning I've read in some time. But there are some problems with the novel as a whole. It's lopsided. Two late-in-the-game revelations aren't carried off with as much finesse as their seriousness requires, though one of them is appropriately disturbing. And there are several long sections of unattributed dialogue where people are arguing about race that get rather grating. There are so many \"issues\" swirling through here that it might feel a little hot-button-y at times. But Moore wisely keeps things on an intimate scale, with the world at large only intruding, as it so often does, in the most devestating ways. A beautiful book. Let's only hope it's not another ten years before we hear from one of our strongest literary voices again."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91373-chris", "userReview": "Similar to my feelings on Jonathan Lethem's latest novel, Chronic City, I think there's a lot to like about this book and there's a lot to dislike about it. At one point I was sure I was going give it four or five stars and at another point I was convinced I was going to give it one or two stars. One minute I would roll my eyes and the next minute something would resonate with me so deeply that I'd forget what it was that had annoyed me the minute before. Stuff that really clicked for me:- The post-9/11 feeling of everything being frozen, from the town in which the story occurs to all of the characters' emotions, ideas, feelings, and abilities to make decisions. - The toddler, Mary-Emma -- maybe it's because I have two little boys near her age, but I was emotionally invested in her story and really bought her as a living, breathing toddler. In fact, she might have been the most believable character in the entire book.- The ways in which Moore compared and contrasted the behavior of adults with that of children. There's a big difference between adults who behave childishly and adults who have a child-like appreciation for the world. I also liked her exploration of the transition from childhood to adulthood through the narrator's story. For so many of us nowadays, that transition is supposed to occur while we are off at college. What do we really learn while we're there? Stuff that didn't click for me:- The excessive wordplay and puns. I know that this is Moore's MO and she's pretty good at it, but I just didn't buy how every character in the book had the same obsession with wordplay that Lorrie Moore has. It's kind of a nerdy obsession. In this book I thought it was overused and annoying.- The racial stuff. This may have something to do with having lived my entire life in one of the most racially diverse areas in the country, but I was struggling with the book's obsession with race. I know enough people who grew up in lily-white towns and who have less-than-PC views on race to know that the racist behavior in this book does still occur, but I guess I was just bored with it. I also think that the reaction to this behavior, in the form of the Wednesday night sessions that the narrator listens in on, went on for far too long with page after page after page of these bitch sessions. But I guess it served its purpose in relation to adults acting like children.- The major plot points. Without spoiling anything, I thought some of these events were emotionally manipulative or just plain silly. Overall Conclusion:Read this book and see for yourself whether or not you like it. Lorrie Moore is a huge talent who deserves to be widely read. It is without a doubt a Lorrie Moore novel. I just wonder if she should have spent the last 10(?) years working on a bunch of Lorrie Moore short stories."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1783655-sarah", "userReview": "I was surprised that I didn't much care for this book, as I love Moore's short stories. Also, I read a galley of it, so I'm not sure how much I can really responsibly say about it. But! I'll continue anyway. \"A Gate at the Stairs\" to me felt messy, bloated, and full of superfluous descriptions and irritating puns and jokes. Maybe I'm still too close to being a college student myself to find it interesting or exciting to look at the world through the eyes of one, but I found Tassie difficult as a narrator and a protagonist, and while she was full of observations, I ended up wishing I found more of them useful. I found her annoying at more than a few turns. The post-9/11 aspect to the book, tied up in Tassie's already-unbelievable relationship with her newly acquired boyfriend Reynaldo, was both a little ludicrous and also kind of deadening. I know that one of the main themes of \"A Gate at the Stairs\" is \"the carelessness perpetrated by others in the name of love,\" but I was left wondering what exactly to take away from the book. There are lovely moments of observation, and Moore's depictions of the attitudes of the affluent toward minorities and biracial children--seemingly gracious, feverishly intellectualized, yet absurdly, condescendingly detached, as if these liberal parents imagine themselves to be righteous crusaders for a cause they feel they are somehow entitled to defend--are spot-on. But they also present a lot of questions that neither Tassie nor Moore really get around to exploring more deeply. Racism in the disguise of altruism, adoption as fantasy, love and loss, the shock of intimacy and personal carelessness--intriguing issues all, and all of them surface at different points throughout \"A Gate at the Stairs,\" but they're more like the backs of whales surfacing in the sea and then being submerged again. Not enough is said about them, strong enough connections aren't made, and in the end, these themes lay largely unexplored beneath a cluttered surface of jokes, fleeting extra characters, scenes of questionable use, and obscure metaphors. There were some things about this book that I really liked, and things that made me really uncomfortable, which I consider a good thing, but I was disappointed in the end."}, {"userName": "christa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40816-christa", "userReview": "Lorrie Moore's \"A Gate at the Stairs\" falls into that tricky category of just-North-of-good -- a gray area that I struggle to write reasonable sentences about. When it comes to me, a blank page and a blinking cursor, I prefer to hate something or want to roll naked in a meadow with it, rather than just thinking it is pretty good. Honestly, I've put off writing about this book for more than two weeks, letting it simmer, giving it far more consideration than 99 percent of the other books I read, hoping for some sort of sauce reduction that would leave behind a chunky stew of ideas instead of a soupy mess. FACT: Not only do I love Lorrie Moore, I am -- according to cultural standards -- supposed to like Lorrie Moore by virtue of being a person who reads a lot of books and frequently constructs sentences. I think puns rule, I think she's quietly hilarious, and I think she has 20/20 vision when it comes to the details of the world. Get a load of this bit: \"I sat in my apartment with the most inane sorts of magazines, all left there by Murph, which read with an avidity and dementia typically brought on by hair salons and winter.\" RESPONSE: I swaddled this novel, loved it, caressed it, stared at the cover, traced the author's name with my finger like it was Braille or I was a stalker, read it slowly and thoughtfully. This one is a year in the life of Tassie, a young college girl -- a farm girl suddenly exposed to Chinese food -- who is looking for a little reinvention and a part time job. She signs on to nanny for a couple that hasn't quite adopted yet, and is undergoing the final interview stages with various knocked-up teen-aged girls. Sarah Brink, a busy and moody chef/restaurant owner and her absent husband eventually adopt a biracial toddler, which almost immediately requires that the new mother hold support group meetings in her living room, wine-fused conversations about racism with a handful of parents. Tassie takes up with a Brazilian -- she thinks -- boy from one of her classes and spends rabid naked afternoons with him, filled with \"I love yous\" that she doles out, but does not get in return. She buys a motorized scooter, plays bass in her living room, misses her roommate, who has disappeared into the blankets of a new boyfriend, and puts off responding to her brother's e-mails. Then, all of a sudden, loads start dropping on Tassie. These unexpected bits of yowch. I was bawling without even realizing I'd started to cry. Kudos, Moore. So it's all pretty good. Tassie's relationship with the toddler is adorable, Tassie's relationship with Sarah Brink is never the same from day to day, Tassie's relationship with Sarah's husband is creepy. I had a hard time understanding exactly who Tassie is, what motivates her, and why what doesn't motivate her doesn't motivate her. She wasn't a character I could nail down in any concrete way."}, {"userName": "K.D. Absolutely", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "userReview": "The story is about Tassie Keltjin who is 20 years old and because her parents cannot send her to school has to look for a job as a nanny. She is accepted by a strange couple, Edward who is weird and Sarah who is weirder. The couple adopted a bi-racial baby named Emmie. When Tassie enters their home and their lives she is like Lorrie Moore's eyes for us to see what's inside including what goes on in the couple's minds. Their convoluted lives are like all of us: it is sometimes chaotic, sometimes funny, sometimes uneventful and dragging and is perfectly captured by Moore's prose and plot. But isn't this what life is? We make wrong decisions. We fight. We do strange things by impulse. But we also love. We care. We trust. We give. We take chances. We risk. We lose but sometimes we win, too.There are some secondary plots like the love life of our heroine and her own family like the changes in their lives as her parents are getting older and her brother is bent on joining the military. Moore also threw some subplot on racism and political remarks. There are also references to contemporary music, movies and literature and they all give some good fun. I also enjoyed the detailed (yet sometimes dragging) descriptions of the scenes including that dinner, B. However, in the end they are just like small sparks of flavors in your mouth. They are there for you to relish or savor but when you finally close the book, you will forget all of those as you move from other books in your possession.This is my second Lorrie Moore and I would say that she was a lot better in her Anagrams (3 stars). Her characters there are funnier and more believable. In fact, I cannot understand why this book, A Gate at the Stairs has been added to the \"1001\" list. There are many other new books that I think deserve the spot. For example, Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall or Bring Up the Bodies were I thought should be shoo-ins to the list but were not.I have her other book, Like Life in my to-be-read folder but I think I will postpone reading that for sometime. This book failed my expectation as I thought that the new additions to the \"1001\" list are somethings that I should look forward to. So far, only Philip Roth's Nemesis (4 stars) and Jose Saramago's Cain (4 stars) exceeded my expectations as they were really exceptional reads."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/419287-jessica", "userReview": "I hate this book, hate hate hate it, and I am going to stop reading now."}, {"userName": "Pamela W", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/148416-pamela-w", "userReview": "Oh boy, I've always loved Lorrie Moore - what is happening to me? I think I might have to stop doing Audio books because I can never tell if the audio is coloring my reception. And now, my rambling diatribe begins - - I hated every character in this book except Mary Emma; was annoyed by the insipid intellectual searching of backwater main character Tassie (into music, Sufism, and yet seemingly not really into anything at all), professing her love for a man who is so obviously booty-calling her but of course she doesn't know that; the irresponsible stand-offish yuppies congratulating themselves for their open-minded biracial relationships and adoptions; the parents of the child and their infuriating backstory; tons of self-undulgent writing that did nothing to move the story forward, helped round out the characters only somewhat, and even then you wished you knew less rather than more because they were annoying characters to begin with. Am I to really believe that a college student would have a lengthy affair with a man she believed to be Brazilian who is in fact middle-Eastern? Wasn't the fact that he didn't speak Portuguese at all a clue? No? His affiliation with the Muslim students' union didn't give raise an eyebrow? And who puts poison in a tupperware container in the refrigerator, exactly? Who then eats said poison and isn't pissed as hell at the idiot who put it in the fridge in a tupperware container? Really?!?! The characters all had this self-professed passion about this or that topic, but they were all ambivalent by nature, and totally unlikeable. If that is what Moore was striving for, as a work of irony this is a 4 start book. I'm rating it in terms of my personal enjoyment (I'm no critic, I'm all about me me me and what I like) and though I really wanted to love this, alas, I did not.

By the end, the only character I cared about anymore had been summarily done away with, and the book had basically self-destructed. It's odd to me that someone who writes with this much detail would be so ignorant about plot development.I just went back and read M. Kakatani's glowing NYTimes review and was amazed at this paragraph:\"Neither Reynaldo nor Sarah and Edward turn out to be who they say they are: revelations that Ms. Moore does a clumsy job of orchestrating (and in the case of Reynaldo, an absurd job of suggesting who he really is). In the hands of most writers such fumbles would instantly derail their story lines, but Ms. Moore is so deft at showing the fallout these discoveries have on her heroine that the reader speeds easily over the narrative bumps.\"I completely disagree that the reader speeds easily over those narrative bumps just because the writing is deft. The absurdity and clumsiness of the storyline completely undermines her writing, in my opinion.

I guess because the characters weren\u2019t credible, consistent or frankly very interesting \u2013 more like composite sketches made up of Lorrie Moore\u2019s best one-liners. But man, some of those one-liners were pure gold. What it comes down to is: the voice does all the work in the novel. Line by beautifully crafted line, rich with wordplay and rueful humor and poetic contemplation, Tassie\u2019s voice is arresting, tart, reactionary. But it also hobbled the plot, because for most of the book, Tassie reacts - just reacts. And those reactions are largely internal. So while the narrator is an excellent observer \u2013 her interior monologue is sardonic, shrewd, melancholy and exuberant \u2013 the character in scene is passive, listless, demure, tepid. And yet that gap never created any problems or tension in the story itself. The person who played the bass, the person who dressed up in the bird costume, the person who got yanked around by her flipperdigibit employer, the person on the Suzuki, the person infatuated with the Muslim student, the person who knew all the names of the plants on the Dellacrosse farm \u2013 they never seemed to gel into one coherent portrait for me.The plot was scattershot, which meant that any tension, or possibility of tension, didn\u2019t develop. I couldn\u2019t decide what this book really wanted to be. Part pastoral rumination, part treatise on race relations in America, part coming of age story, part post-9/11 romance (the least believable part of the book), part family tragedy, part town-and-country malaise. There\u2019s so little tension that the various ploys to ratchet up the intrigue only struck me as false, transparent. Sarah\u2019s past, Mary-Emma\u2019s fate, Robert\u2019s fate \u2013 these revelations felt forced to me, and while they might be heartbreaking out of context, within the arc of the narrative they read more like attempts to make something happen, to generate some external drama.The voice is the reason to read this book, and I\u2019m never, ever going to be able to pull off a smidgeon of Lorrie Moore\u2019s brainy wit.

Parents can take all sorts of safety measures to keep their children safe, such as installing a gate at the stairs for example. But one can\u2019t anticipate all dangers, and there\u2019s always a nagging fear of the unanticipated danger. The moment I first heard of the title of this book I wondered to myself, \u201cWas there an accident?\u201d The development of the story as described in this book includes various ominous signs of lurking danger, but the reader isn\u2019t quite sure which ones are real. As it turns out, the gate at the stairs isn\u2019t the biggest danger we need to worry about. And for those of you who are guessing that harm must have come to the child in the care of the babysitter, it's not what you're thinking. The author appears to have bent over backwards to devise a plot in which she could include every possible statement she\u2019s ever heard about issues of race in today\u2019s American culture. If there is one permutation of words about race that\u2019s not included in this book, I haven\u2019t thought of it yet. Even my favorite quote, \u201cAnyone who says they\u2019re not a racist, is a racist,\u201d was included. It may sound like I\u2019m complaining, but actually not. The author did a good job of spreading these \u201crace discussions\u201d out over several sessions and sprinkling them with humor so that it can be bearable to the average reader. However, the first part of the book was a bit of a drag for an old guy like me. Reading about a coed babysitter isn\u2019t my idea of an interesting story. The story appears better in retrospect after it\u2019s finished, but the experience of reading before reaching the end is oddly unsatisfying. So this is not a good book to leave unfinished.The coed narrator of this story appears to expect sex on first dates. Somehow I don\u2019t want to believe this to be typical for a Midwestern farm girl. The fling described in this story sounded a bit unreal to me. I think the author could have made this part of the story more believable by elaborating on the psychological neediness of the narrator for her to jump so quickly into this sort of relationship with a virtual unknown. When the reader gets near the end and thinks that the story is over, it isn't. The story's narrator does something at a funeral that can only happen in a novel (in my opinion). Also, there's a message from the dead in a way that can only happen in the world of email. The very last sentence of the book indicates that she's learned to say no, which I consider to be positive.The following short review of this book is from the PageADay Book Lover's Calendar for 6-13-2013:Lorrie Moore is perhaps most well-known for her short stories, but after a 15-year hiatus, she returned to the novel form with this quietly powerful, widely acclaimed book. Moore looks at race, class, and love through the lens of 20-year-old Tassie, who takes a job as a part-time nanny as the novel opens. By the time it ends, she\u2019ll be a different person, and far less innocent.\nA GATE AT THE STAIRS\n, by Lorrie Moore (Vintage, 2009)"}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "[For example \u2026 Baby Mary-Emma is taken away, never to be heard from again.

Now, in her dazzling new novel\u2014her first in more than a decade\u2014Moore turns her eye on the anxiety and disconnection of post-9/11 America, on the insidiousness of racism, the blind-sidedness of war, and the recklessness thrust on others in the name of love. As the United States begins gearing up for war in the Middle East, twenty-year-old Tassie Keltjin, the Midwestern daughter of a gentleman hill farmer\u2014his \u201cKeltjin potatoes\u201d are justifiably famous\u2014has come to a university town as a college student, her brain on fire with Chaucer, Sylvia Plath, Simone de Beauvoir. Between semesters, she takes a job as a part-time nanny. The family she works for seems both mysterious and glamorous to her, and although Tassie had once found children boring, she comes to care for, and to protect, their newly adopted little girl as her own. As the year unfolds and she is drawn deeper into each of these lives, her own life back home becomes ever more alien to her: her parents are frailer; her brother, aimless and lost in high school, contemplates joining the military. Tassie finds herself becoming more and more the stranger she felt herself to be, and as life and love unravel dramatically, even shockingly, she is forever changed.
