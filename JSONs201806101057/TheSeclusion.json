The Seclusion was a mixture of The Giver, 1984 and V for Vendetta all rolled into a nice package with a little touch of Trump thrown in. WOW again.The Characters: Patch: What an amazingly strong female lead character. We need more strong females like this in books. She was intelligent, questioned things on her own and didn't have to depend on others to rescue her in every situation. Rexx: My sweet boy, what a doll. While I wished we had seen his family and gotten to know them like we did Patch's family it was still amazing to get to know him. He had such an openness towards everything and was strong and resourceful. Great character to compliment Patch. Oliver: I love you Oliver, I hope there is a book two and we see you there. A remarkable representation of the good in humanity even when it feels like there is none left. Robbie: I hope, like Oliver, we see you in book 2. You deserve your story to be told. Plot: Like I said it's such an amazing mix of all that makes dystopian novels such wonderful reads. It plays on the fears of Trumps America just enough but allows for other extremest ideas to be explored within it. Well worth the read and it opens up so many opportunities for both books about 2029 and the current situation with Patch."}, {"userName": "Isabel", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17355900-isabel", "userReview": "I recieved an ARC through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. I thought this was kinda be a bad or shittier Matched. Like, the love aspect is there in the book and I didn't really believe it but it was nothing like Matched at all. When I first read Matched, it was a favorite. I devoured the books but it hasn't really stood the test of time. I'm sure a lot of us can relate to that. I don't know why I did think it was gonna be like Matched by Ally Condie, but I'm glad it wasn't. While it has some similar aspects such as \"The Board\" in the book can be related to \"the officials\" in Matched, and there are similarities, in this book it feels more developed. It feels a bit more organic, and some of the things honestly reminded me about The Handmaid's Tale (obs! not the book but the series). There are some problematic things in the book I really didn't get such as the love aspect which just left me ???? okay ??? but I'm not gonna go into spoilers.One thing that also slightly bothered me was information dumps. There was a lot of them, and they didn't really seem to be in the right place most of the time even though I get WHY they were there. I think I'd read this book again or definitely check out the author with more books."}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22458136-audrey", "userReview": "This was dystopian sci-fi with a 1984 type totalitarian government. The basic premise is that the United States has built walls on all of its boarders and now The Board monitors and controls every aspect of everyone\u2019s lives. As an American, it made me think, \u201cwhat if we really did start building walls?\u201dI liked that this book is set in a near enough future that there is still some history in the minds of a few citizens. The main characters are young and they don\u2019t know any other way of life. Their lack of knowledge plays an important role in their journey. This book did a really good job of not giving you too much information before you needed it. It kept the story moving along at a fast pace, but I never felt lost or confused. I really enjoyed it and I thought the ending was great."}, {"userName": "Nprice84", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82691906-nprice84", "userReview": "I couldn't stop turning pages because I loved how a bit more of The Seclusion's interesting world was revealed each chapter. Some of the plot elements were extremely relevant to the modern era and made a big impact. Much of the details were scarily plausible and I couldn't help but imagine my own child living in this world. It was a really fun book to read, and I hope there is a sequel."}, {"userName": "Ralph J", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80621344-ralph-j", "userReview": "Suspenseful dystopian novel about American future where corporations have taken over and limited freedom for everyone's safety.

These options are my own and no one else\u2019s. Also, this is a slightly different review based on my thoughts WHILE reading the book. I will publish a more in-depth (not bullet pointed !) review on my blog, nearer the time of publication. This book was really good! Here are some of my thoughts on the book! It has spoilers so sorry but not like major spoilers. * So it started of by telling us about the wall and also hinting how nobody knows how secure it really is * \u2018The devil lies in the details\u2019*Ooh... I like secrets. And that\u2019s a pretty good idea* Mc is 22. I thought it was too old but not really. * She likes the feeling of dirt and doesn\u2019t want to enhance herself with beauty things. * The girs\u2019s clever! She knows science and stuff!*YAY!! She has flaws and she has real life struggles like forgetting to go shopping!!* But she has that friend who doubts? Maybe too similar to other plots*Cos it\u2019s always like oh no after a disaster world. We\u2019ve got a great world but there must be some secrets. Looks for secrets. Realises whole life life is a lie. Torture. Pain. And I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s going to be a revolt in the next book????* OMG!!! They find a secret suitcase full of \u2018printed, bound, ink and paper books\u2019*Love that description but they should Obviously LEAVE. * The fact that Patricia thinks there are only patriots or traitors made it quite unique. You can\u2019t really be just one or the other.* \u2019Musty, aged paper - that grassy, vanilla smell\u2019 oh no \ud83d\ude31 YOU CANNOT BURN THE BOOKS?!?!?* The betrayal was really sad but the fact that Patricia isn\u2019t like super mad means that she\u2019s really stupid or too kind. * She\u2019s also cool in an intense situation! She knows what to pack and stuff but also has emotions and freezes. * I like how quotes from other books are used* That\u2019s pretty cool * Patricia also knows what\u2019s important and doesn\u2019t mope or throw a tantrum because Rexx didn\u2019t tell her about the letter* but NOOOOO DOES THERE HAVE TO BEE ROMANCE BETWEEN THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS??????* I\u2019d have preferred it if Rexx stayed a bit broken and so did Patricia and the romance came like right at the end of the book. * i mean they lost they\u2019re best friend and Rexx lost his girlfriend and he should be acting all broken and guilty not like \u2018I\u2019ve wanted to do that for a long time?????\u2019* ughhhhh. * Seriously? His girlfriend\u2019s probably dead and he can\u2019t just fall in love with his girlfriend\u2019s (and his) best friend???* But it was sweet * if Rexx stayed broken, tho, it would have hurt my heart more and made me love him even more but I guess I can get over him and Patricia * oh and there wasn\u2019t a love triangle between Oliver Rexx and Patricia which is always good* I think the statement \u2018It felt like a lifetime\u2019 is quite overrated. You\u2019d probably find something like that (if not the exact words) in probably every dystopian story?* I like how her pain wasn\u2019t under or over exaggerated so it made it easy for me to sympathise with Patricia * Also made it seem as if they\u2019d never get out which kept me wondering cos they\u2019d have to get out somehow. * I love the bit when she said the five details about her father! It was so sweet!* The chapters ended on cliffhangers and made me want to keep reading* The ending wasn\u2019t like a MASSIVE cliffhanger which is good but I NEED a second book. * Omg what happens next??? Does Rex come back?? Omg he can\u2019t be dead!?!?!? I neeed my small broken baby to come back!!!!"}, {"userName": "Pibrocher", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82375168-pibrocher", "userReview": "America unified and secure - what price would you be willing to pay? The Seclusion provides a great vehicle for exploring this question and leaves the reader hoping that this all too possible tale remains a work of fiction. The nation's citizens are cared for, protected, and entertained - all of this in exchange for their unerring obedience and disclosure - So what should a smart, obedient scientist do when she discovers something they don't want anyone to know? I loved Patch's journey from dutiful employee of The Board and member of society to a fiery champion for change. Her adventure across the wastelands of the future United States is exhilarating and eerie and just the sort of fiction that chills you in the shadow of recent news and events. A cathartic, world-shattering, cautionary tale for our modern age of ideological and informational landmines. The Seclusion reminds us why we must tread carefully!"}, {"userName": "Sue R", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80623842-sue-r", "userReview": "I love author's first books and this one is amazing.
