As for Derek, I'm at a loss as what is going to happen. i favor Lucas, I think because he's loved Kylie so long I think that they truly are soul mates, but I love Derek and his sensitivity swell:(((October 3rd:Let me just start by raising a nice middle finger to Lucas..... You freaking ruined all my plans!Phew. Okay so anyways... THIS BOOK WAS FABULOUS! I loved the the sense of mystery that was consistent through the entire book!! I was constantly trying to figure out what the answer was and in the end is wasn't shocking but every engaging. My main complaint for this book was that although it was action packed it felt like a filler book for the ending. :// I wanted a little more resolution. Oh, and Lucas in the last two percent. I really wanted to punch him in the face...... SIGHI don't want to give to much away but Ill just say that only one part of my prediction above was right, and Im still at whats going to happen in the last book, but I CANNOT WAIT TO READ IT!!!!!!!!!5 stars for C.C.

Really a part of me is confused. I am still kinda mad at Derek for what he did and how he kept on blowing kylie off even when she tried to make it work with him. Lucas I love Lucas ( and Derek ) but he can be an annoying jealous little prick at sometimes which plucks a nerve.

I really can't get enough of the characters in Shadow Falls! Every installment just endears me more and more to their interactions, foibles, and character flaws. It all makes me love them the more. Except for one particular character in this installment. *grumbles emphatically* Whose name I can't say because of spoilers. Damn you spoilers, I so want to call this character out on their bad behavior!! Needless to say, that particular character went down in my estimation in this book. I definitely decided on my 'team' also. It so far in the series has flip flopped between Derrek and Lucas on equal occasion - but not any more! My bed is firmly made. ;)Kylie is getting ever-closer to discovering the secrets of her identity as a supernatural in 'Whispers at Moonrise'. But what with every other crazy thing going on in her life (including her mid-life crises parents, her triangle shaped love life, not to mention seeing the ghost of someone close to her that's still alive!), how can she possibly handle everything, and keep her sanity? What sacrifices will Kylie have to make to find out what she really is, and where she ultimately belongs?I can't believe I have to wait all the way until next spring for the final installment!!!! And OMG, the final cover art is frickin' beautifully gorgeous! *fangirls and pulls hair out erratically*Sidenote: On the topic of beautiful covers. This cover....hmmm - why am I so disappointed? It has all the makings for a beautiful cover...but it's just not quite right. I may feel this way purely because the other covers have been frickin' GORGEOUS, and my eyes have simply been spoiled - the book-art-appreciation section of my brain overstimulated by the aesthetic wonders of the previous three offerings...but none the less, I'm still a little sad about this one.Every other book has had a cover that centers around some kind of vertical landscape scene behind the title (be it a tree, waterfall, negative space between cliffs)...but this cover has a big square hole cut out of the middle and the title slapped inside it (like a sticker almost). It looks rushed, and not very well thought out."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9659631-jacqueline", "userReview": "May 18 2016I agree with my past self with how I can't help but enjoy reading this series!

Kylie had yet another mysterious ghost asking her for help to catch her killer/find her body/get closure\u2026 Naturally, Kylie did very little investigating\u2026 But she did do a whole lot of moaning. So that's something\u2026 Right?Also, Kylie tried to come to terms with who and what she was \u2014 which was annoying because that was what she was doing in the last three bloody books. Surely, she should have known by now.There was also a few boy problems and family problems thrown in for angst, drama and shit. -Kylie didn't stop whining from beginning to end. She was a self-pitying whingy cow - It was torture to read.She was frustrating to boot \u2014 she kept things to herself for dumb reasons and then got all upset if someone else didn't trust her.What I found most annoying about Kylie was how much of a Mary Sue and speshul snowflake she was. Her powers were just ridiculous \u2014 there was literally nothing she couldn't do. Of course, everyone was in awe of her and her powers but Kylie thought she was a freak (that's new for a YA heroine) and felt sorry for herself. I hate it when heroines who have rare-amazing-unique-powers just moan about how much of a freak they are\u2026 When it's clear that their powers are cool-speshul-snowflake like powers. Ugh.-Lucas was horrible. He treated Kylie like utter shit and that doormat Kylie just let him walk all over her.Lucas was such a hypocrite and he was full of double standards \u2014 he bitched about Kylie hanging out with Derek and threw hissy fits if she didn't do as he said\u2026 Yet he thought it was okay if he hung out with his ex ALL THE TIME, and if he did whatever the hell he wanted even if it hurt her. Ugh\u2026 he was so repulsive, weak, slimy and scummy.Lucas's rapey abilities didn't do him any favours either.-More Lucas hate: Lucas was a huge betraying, lying, cheating arsehole. He basically got married to some other girl just so he could please his dad. Then he lied to Kylie about it and acted like a bitch about everything. Also, Kylie saw him kiss his wife/fiancee and he looked 'genuinely happy' about it\u2026 Hmm\u2026 If he didn't want to be married to the other girl like he claimed, why did he look genuinely happy about the kiss and the marriage? Why didn't he look conflicted or guilty? Well, I'll tell you why\u2026 It was because he was a dick \u2014 he wanted the perfect werewolf wife and then he wanted Kylie to be his teenage mistress. That dog. He showed Kylie zero respect and he put everyone else above her yet I was somehow supposed to magically believe that he loved her. Bullshit.-Derek was the lame second love interest that never really stood a chance. I didn't like him because he acted like Kylie's bitch and I that was off putting.-The best thing about the book was the secondary characters - Holliday, Burnett and Perry were great\u2026 And even Miranda and Della were okay when they weren't bitching about other girls.-Miranda and Perry's relationship was rather sweet\u2026 They made a much better couple than Lucas and Kylie, who just came across as obnoxious and self-involved. -What did everyone do at the camp? Kylie and her friends seemed to have no structure to their days. There was barely any mentions of lessons or activities until the very end. It was frustrating to read characters that just floated around with no apparent purpose or goal.-There were loads of instances were female characters called themselves or other female characters bitches, skanks and sluts. That's always nice in a YA book.-There seemed to be a general undertone of female characters having to be ashamed of sex or wanting sex. Also, I felt like I was being lectured on sex. Guys can have sex but if girls have sex they're all whores. Nice.All in all\u2026 Rubbish. I shall be reading the next Shadow Falls book purely for completion's sake."}, {"userName": "Paige", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7910910-paige", "userReview": "I hope she ends up with Derek ."}, {"userName": "Lisarenee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2038272-lisarenee", "userReview": "Notes: I'm one of C.C. Hunter's Street Team and received an advance copy of this book. \n\"Why does my life need to be so damn hard?\"\nKylie Galen thought finding out what she was would make things better, but it didn't. If anything it just complicated things even more. She has finally discovered what type of supernatural she is, well, sort of. She knows the name, but not exactly what it truly entails. She is a chameleon and no one seems to know exactly what that is, but Kylie's hopeful it doesn't involve a tail and a really long tongue. Perhaps it explains her crazy brain pattern and why everyone has been having so much trouble reading it? She's still coming into her powers, and while she now knows what she is, she is about to discover what she is truly capable of, and it's quite spectacular. Chameleons are known for changing their colors to blend in, so you have to wonder what a supernatural chameleon can do?Meanwhile, her ghost whispering skills are once again being called upon, but this ghost is the scariest by far because it looks like someone Kylie knows...and they're not dead! Is she now able to speak to people's ghosts before they've passed? If so, can she prevent their death? One thing Kylie knows from her previous experiences is that listening to a ghost can sometimes determine whether someone lives or dies.Additionally, her father stated before he faded back into the land of the unliving that they'd find out what being a chameleon meant together. Does that mean she is going to die too? So many questions, but the answers are forthcoming. One question posed toward the beginning of the book will gain more significance toward the end...\n\"Have you ever known the right thing to do, but couldn't do it?\"\nKylie will need to make a difficult decision she wishes she didn't have to make. The irony is that the person who posed the question will be the one to finally make her see there truly is only one right choice for her and push her one step closer to finding her destiny. She'll come to realize, \n'Life could still hurt like a paper-cut right across the heart...Every new day was about opportunities. You couldn't always control life, just your response to it.'\n_________________This was such a fun book with so much revealed yet leaving so much more yet to be discovered. I truly can't wait to see what the next, and sadly last, book of the series will hold. Is there anyway to sign a petition to extend the series? Each book seems to pull me deeper and deeper into the story.In 'Whispers at Moonrise', Kylie will finally get to meet her paternal grandfather. He holds the answers she craves. She'll learn what a chameleon is and some of what one can do. She still hasn't gained her full powers and hasn't yet gained total control over those she currently possesses. New powers seem to randomly appear, but she'll find they aren't as random as she thought, and begin learning how to control them.Lucas will show aspirations of gaining a seat on the were Council. He wants to make a difference. To do so, however, he has to gain his father's approval. He's secretive about what that entails, but asks Kylie to have faith in their relationship and in him.Kylie will once again be haunted by a ghost and need to put her protective powers to use to save someone. The difference with this ghost is that it looks like someone Kylie knows and cares for. Holiday says sometimes ghosts can have an identity crisis and put on the face of someone else, but is that what is truly going on? She'll have to sort things out to get to the bottom of who the ghost is trying to warn her about before it's too late.Why is the book named 'Whispers at Moonrise'? I believe it has to do with this:'Moonrise, she thought. She felt again the whispers echoing in her mind. Whispers she couldn't understand, whispers that both lured her and frightened her.'Something is whispering for Kylie to come and join them in the forest. She'll need to decide whether to refrain from the compulsion or give in to it.Overall, I gave this one 4 1/2 out of 5 roses. I loved the drama involved with the ghost. I loved the difficulty involved with Kylie's decision to stay or to go with her grandfather. I enjoyed the interaction with Holiday and seeing Kylie's powers go astray. I loved pretty much everything that went on, but felt things were a teeny bit dragged out when it came to discovering what a chameleon was. I thought enough clues were given at the end of 'Taken at Dusk' to give everyone a good idea, but I did love some of the humor that went with the speculation. Action and emotion go hand in hand in this one, and I can't wait to see what Ms. Hunter has up her sleeve for the next book. This one will leave you craving for the next book, 'Chosen at Nightfall'. I keep hoping for a spin-off series."}, {"userName": "Nicole Wang", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5180567-nicole-wang", "userReview": "Kylie knows what she is now, but not what it means. She\u2019s a chameleon? She\u2019s a lizard? She has no idea what\u2019s going on now and has more questions than answers. And to add to that, why did that ghost have Holly\u2019s face? Holly isn\u2019t dead yet\u2026but does that just mean that she will? (ok, so there\u2019s a spoiler in my review which means if you don\u2019t want to know this tiny spoiler, avoid all paragraphs with a *) Not to mention that even though Kylie\u2019s finally chosen Lucas, she can\u2019t deny her feelings for Derek or that Lucas is hot one second, cold the next. What\u2019s a not-so-human girl to do?*I think this was definitely my favorite book out of all of them. It was different in the way that it wasn\u2019t action-y and was more a mystery. This was basically the book where most of our questions were answered while at the same time, Kylie and the rest of the gang were trying to figure out who killed Holiday\u2019s twin sister. And jeez! They went one some awesome traces/leads and I loved guessing who killed her, why, and everything else. As morbid as it sounds, this was definitely my kind of book!What I didn\u2019t like? I didn\u2019t get why Kylie didn\u2019t tell Holiday about the ghost with her face. It just seemed weird. I mean, sure it would\u2019ve scared her but Holiday had the right to know plus it would\u2019ve been easier and faster to figure out why the ghost had her face if Holiday had known. It just really annoyed me to hell and back. But hey, that only lasted 1/3 of the book!While Kylie was a little annoying when it came to romance in the beginning you\u2019ll eventually forgive her when it\u2019s clear she\u2019s literally torn apart between her feelings for Derek and the ones she has for Lucas. I mean, they\u2019re both awesome guys and honestly? While I\u2019m Team Lucas, I did fall for Derek. He\u2019s the complete opposite of Lucas and I was just as torn as Kylie was. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW SWOON WORTHY THESE TWO GUYS ARE?Characters? This is going to be long\u2026You guys, my favorite character absolutely has to be Della! She\u2019s so snarky and fun that you just have to love her! If possible, she\u2019s more snarky in this book than in any other! And she was an amazing friend besides, no matter WHAT she says/acts like. Miranda was too! And I loved how she kept squealing about Perry after they (finally) got together! It was too cute!I\u2019m not even going to mention the boys. That would take too much squealing. Sigh. I\u2019m totally crushing on too many book boyfriends.Kylie is definitely a great MC. She wasn\u2019t as stupid as some other characters; she figured (most of) the things out and I loved that she would give the benefit of a doubt and that she always, always, understood. Err\u2026well, most of the time!OMG. You guys! The ending. The ending! AGH! Can I choke someone? You could hear my jaw drop half way around the world. I was not expecting that at all and loved that this book could surprise me right when I had things figured out! I can honestly say that I\u2019ve never been more surprised! And I\u2019ve never read a more cliffhang-y cliffhanger.As stunning as the first three, C.C. Hunter writes an amazing fourth installment that will answer some questions, but raise even more. A thrillingly satisfying read, Whispers at Moonrise will keep you guessing until the last page, leaving you shocked and aching for Chosen at Nightfall!"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4979538-erin", "userReview": "Okay, we're four books into this series, and I'm afraid I'm calling it quits. The concept for this series was so unique and exciting, and it could have been a truly epic story. We're talking X-Men meets Harry Potter and blows them both out of the water! Unfortunately, it's fallen victim to stale plot, extremely repetitive dialogue/thoughts from the characters, and a \"love triangle\" so infuriating that I don't want the heroine to get either guy anymore.It seems I'm in the minority on disliking the last two books in this series, but for me there are just so many suspenseful, original, twist-filled stories out there with amazing characters, and this falls way short of the mark. After four books listening to Kylie whine about her indecisions and confusion about what she is, I am SO over her. To the point where, when at 15% into this book that's all the story really entailed, I didn't want to read on. I don't know that I've ever been so irritated with a heroine in a story before, and this has been across multiple books!! The staleness factor stems from the feeling that with each of these books, there's this basic dialogue and plot that is repeated every time amongst a few new twists and characters. In every book, Kylie will have nearly identical thoughts and conversations with her friends and Holiday about whether she should choose Lucas or Derek, what her changing patterns mean, and how frustrated she is about not knowing what she is yet. I honestly couldn't believe that four books into this series we had to read this again, I mean come ON! The number of times the phrase \"I don't know\" is spoken regarding Kylie's powers and who she loves more has got to be a record. I did skim read through this to the end, just because I wanted to be able to write an honest review. There were a few revelations and things finally progress for one couple that I sort of still cared about, and then there was the usual exciting climax at the end. Nothing epic, but it at least breathed some life into the story. But the Lucas/Derek/Kylie love triangle, that just got drop-kicked onto it's head one too many times. Don't get me wrong, I love the thrills of a love that has trials and tribulations to get through before the HEA, but this is getting ridiculous. Derek, who I always loved more than Lucas, just needs to throw in the towel and find someone who can make up her mind. Lucas, who seemed to be taking the distant bad boy route this time, doesn't deserve Kylie, either. Not that I'm a fan of hers, but I can only take so much of the testosterone-filled were who makes the woman he loves feel like dirt. So, I'm sad to say that I'm done with this series, I just can't see spending more time on one more book that will probably just frustrate me. Hopefully all will work out well with these characters, and I'm sure I'll sneak a peek at some reviews with spoilers to find out, but I won't be reading on."}, {"userName": "Suzanne ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5952567-suzanne", "userReview": "May contain spoilersWhispers at Moonrise is the fourth book in the Shadow Falls series. And with only one more book planned in the series, I know I'm going to be deeply saddened to leave this world which I've really enjoyed spending time in. Kylie is living at Shadow Falls, a camp for supernaturals. But Kylie isn't like the other kids at camp, she's not a vampire, or werewolf, or shifter, or fae. She's a chameleon, which means she has the DNA for many different types of supernatural. Not many chameleons exist and very little is known about them, so Kylie feels like a freak. She hasn't yet learned to control her changes so she's never sure what she's going to be at any one time. She's also a ghost whisperer which means she sees spirits and helps them to solve their problems so they can cross over. And if all that doesn't make her weird enough, she's also the first half blood protector. She gains amazing strength and speed when someone else is in danger but she can't protect herself in dangerous situations. Kylie has two amazing, hot guys vying for her attention. Derek who's fae and Lucas, a werewolf. When she appears to have made her choice, a whole new can of worms opens up and she's left miserable.She has two brilliant best friends, Miranda who's a witch and Della, a vampire, who she also shares a cabin with. The trio really care for and look out for each other. Kylie has an extremely close relationship with the camp leader, Holiday, a fae. Burnett is another camp leader, a vampire, who is crazy about Holiday. Kylie has been trying to get them together for a long time as she's sure Holiday feels the same but won't give in because she's been hurt before.But being a chameleon, so unusual and so powerful, brings with it it's own danger for Kylie. She's on the radar of a gang run by Mario, also a chameleon, who previously kidnapped her and wanted her to marry his grandson. He is ruthless, killing his own grandson when he tried to protect Kylie. And the FRU, kind of like the supernatural FBI, want to carry out tests/experiments on her, the same experiments that led to the death of her grandmother. Her grandfather wants to take her away to live with him so he can protect her and teach her what she needs to know to survive as a chameleon. She doesn't want to leave Shadow Falls as it feels like her home, the only place she belongs. Whispers at Moonrise is a brilliant instalment in the Shadow Falls series, maybe the best one yet. A killer is on the loose. Having already killed three girls, Holiday is next on his list. And with only the help of one of the dead girls, Kylie must try to find out who the killer is before time runs out. She's also dealing with her own problems of being on Mario's hitlist, trying to figure out more about being a chameleon and not feel like such a freak and, deal with the fact that she and Lucas are spending very little time together, the reason being, that the pack doesn't approve of her. From the very first book, this series reeled me in and has kept me riveted since. And now, with only one more to go, Chosen at Nightfall will be a bittersweet read. I can't wait to have it in my hands yet I don't want this series to come to an end."}, {"userName": "Jessica *The Lovely Books*", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2621253-jessica-the-lovely-books", "userReview": "******SPOILERS******Not my favorite of the series.

I'm crying like a freaking baby right now!!! Why did it have to end this way?! WHY!!!!!?You know that feeling when you read a book, get completely lost in the story, and before you know it you finished it and you just want more and more and more? You know that if you won't know what happens next soon, you will explode? Well that's how i felt. This series seriously NEVER disappoints me! :) I have waited SO LONG FOR THIS HEAVEN!!!I have no idea how the author does it, how does she do it? Every single book in the Shadow Falls novel is so amazingly fabulous!!! Every time it takes me on a timeless emotional ride that i just don't want to end!!! Can i just say, i am so freaking glad and happy that i could come back to Shadow Falls and loose my self in the plot and story once again. I have waited for freaking AGES to get my hands on Whispers at Moonrise, 6 months. Why can't the author have some mercy? Doesn't she see that waiting so long for the next book is pure TORTURE!!!?The characters were like use-all, so amazing and realistic. I LOVE THEM ALL! Seriously, they are such fantastic characters that it feels like they are real and i know them.Kylie ( main character) is such a nice and cool girl, what she is is so awesome!!!Derek ( half fae, used to be with Kiley and is in love with her) is so caring and understanding! I LOVE that guy myself. I wish they could be together - sight.Lucas ( werewolf, Kylies boyfriend) is pure hotness, but what he did at the end to Kylie was just horrible. Kylie felt so betrayed, and so did i ( not that i liked the dude anyway). I just knew he was going to hurt her sooner or later, i was like screaming for Kylie to push him off a cliff already or something and get back to that beautiful fae that loves her ( truly loves her).I loved how Kylie tried to help everyone, even thought she had more problems than hair on her head herself.I love the cover, in fact i love all the covers. I love the titles of the books as well. Let's face it, i love everything about this series. IT'S SIMPLY THE BEST.k, let's talk about the ending before i'll explode. I was SHOCKED. And when i say i was shocked, i mean i can't breath, eyes winded like a big moon kind of shocked. I'm still so emotional over what happened with Lucas and Kylie. I think i was even more shocked than her. I literally jumped out of my seat, i had to read standing up. The very ending was the part where i really cried, i was going through what Kylie was going through. It was like i wasn't in my bedroom anymore, i was right there beside Kylie, feeling what she felt. I did what she didn't, couldn't, i cried, and i think i cried not only for her but for her friends and everyone else at Shadow Falls. The ending left me breathless, literally.Then, i almost cried again because i realized that the same torture awaits me, waiting 6 moths for the next masterpiece whilst imagining and trying to constantly figure out what would happen next. I seriously hope i will be able to sleep at night.Overall, Whispers at Moonrise is an excellent, well written and full of surprises book that will have you on edge and holding on for the glorious ride, which you won't want to end.

Which I don't. They're so bad they're good.The thing that annoys me about these books is not the dragged plot that just repeats itself (I survived Glee season 3).But Kylie. Everyone only thinks about Kylie's safety, Kylie's species, Kylie's love life.And everyone forgives her and defends her. In their world she can do no wrong. Sometimes it makes sense, like when she went into the woods to save... someone. Other times it didn't. Since when can a child ask someone if they're having sex with someone, and get no punishment? And she acted all shocked when John said she lacked respect and was rude. Last time I checked saying the things she said is pretttty rude. Also Lucas climbed into her window and kissed her? How is that not creepy? Especially since they were only 6 or 7 at the time. When I was 6, I would rather jump into shark infested waters then kiss a boy and I'm pretty sure the boys felt even stronger about the girls.Last of all, does Shadow Falls do anything? Supernaturals just go there and do whatever the hell they want all day. The only arranged activity is spending an hour with someone. Shouldn't there be classes on spells for witches and that kind of thing? There isn't much of a point to the camp part of Shadow Falls if they just sit around all day.But, if you pretend this is a satirical novel imitating teen fiction it's pretty good. I gave it 2/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Desu", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5530991-desu", "userReview": "Ahh, I can't wait till this books out.I just finished the 3rd one.

I fell in love with the series when I read Born at Midnight, and for once these books come out every six months (about).(Caution contains some spoilers)THINGS I LOVED:1) The plot, I had always hoped that Kylie would do something like she did in the end! Talk about a cliff-hanger!2) That she found out what she was. 3) That we actually found out a little about Holiday's past4) Burnett getting jealous over Blake. I mean finally Burnett shows some sort of affection towards Holiday!5) The ending, Holiday dying and Kyle bringing her back to life!6) Kylie leaving Lucas! Ha ha ha, in your face Lucas! Go DEREK!!THINGS I DIDN'T LOVE SO MUCH:1) That Kylie was with Lucas through out the book. In the first three books I hoped that Kylie would end up with Lucas, but by the end of the third book, I got tiered of him. I kept on thinking that Lucas was just dragging Kylie along, and that he cared about his pack more than her.2) The whole Kylie and Holiday talks, I found them to be boring and unimportantOther than that I really enjoyed the book, can't wait for the next one!! :)"}, {"userName": "Nicola", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39574886-nicola", "userReview": "Definitiv bisher der beste Teil. Kylie entwickelt sich mehr und mehr zu einer tollen, straken Protagonisten und wirkt nicht mehr ganz so d\u00fcmmlich wie zuvor. Die etlichen Wiederholungen k\u00f6nnten meiner Meinung nach weiter reduziert werden. Das Ende fand ich doch teilweise sehr \u00fcberraschend, da die B\u00fccher ansonsten bisher sehr vorhersehbar waren.

At least, that's what her dead father keeps insisting that she is even though no one else seems to have heard of chameleon supernaturals. She's also attempting to deal with the fact that Lucas' pack doesn't want him to see her anymore because she's not a werewolf. Life is getting complicated again. But all of that falls to the wayside when Kylie's newest ghost shows up. This one looks exactly like one of her closest friends - a friend who isn't dead yet. Kylie will have to figure out what's going on before it's too late...I cannot recommend this book, and the series that follows, enough. I'm going to guesstimate this to be my fourth or fifth read. I am still completely obsessed with Kylie Galen and her insane, supernatural life. The characters are people I would actually like to hang out with and Kylie's never-ending supply of life-changing drama is beyond entertaining."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "I don't know about this one.

The family bonds are... Yeah. Interesting.I think I consistently appreciate the ghost parts of these stories. They add in some real drama and spookiness in an otherwise very romance oriented series. This time especially was creepy because of who the ghost was and what they were trying to accomplish. There was a real applicable ghost story this time and it wasn't just in the past stuff which I appreciated. I will say that I felt that the surprises were a little predictable and I had the bad guy pegged from the beginning.That being said. I did enjoy this one. Without giving too much away, I was moderately heartbroken in the end and I hope that things are resolved in the next book. But it certainly added some drama.The writing is consistently good. The story drags a little in places, but not bad, and we finally get some real answers about Kylie which is awesome.I do think that Holiday and Burnett have too strong of a connection to Kylie sometimes. Are they even paying attention to the other campers? And it almost seems like Kylie is the only one they baby. They shouldn't be utilizing the other campers like I do and I feel that Holiday would have more of a problem with this. Still, I like how they've become like surrogate parents to her. Also, Kylie hugs too much. I man jeez.Not sure what else to say about this one except that the romance is both annoying and engaging. The story is good, but drags on occasion, and I think that while sometimes Hunter has a tendency to make everyone a little too \"we're all bffs\", I appreciate that the relationshipsa are complex, too.I would still recommend this, especially if you enjoyed the first few. Still heavy with the romance, but there are other things going on."}, {"userName": "Mckenna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13492432-mckenna", "userReview": "Just finished reading this, and I've got to say.......... I loved it. This is one of my favorite series.***SPOILER ALERT***Favorite things-- The cover. The title. Della, the baddest vampire. Miranda, the dyslexic witch. Derek, the perfect man. Kylie, the chameleon (loved that part!) Burnett, for finally admitting his feelings. Holiday, for saying yes. Socks, for turning back into a kitten. Unpredictable magic, including a six pack. And just about everything else.The bad parts-- Lucas. I don't like him, he's a filthy lying dog. Monique, Lucas's fiance. The fact that she (MAJOR SPOILER!!) left. Actually I kinda liked that part. It will make the next book more interesting, and it made Lucas sad. Confusing-- The chick with the sword at the end. What was that about? I've been thinking, and I have come up with 2 possible reasons. 1.) It was just random or it showed her control was growing. 2.) That ghost is connected to what happens in the next book, like she gets possessed byt that ghost or something. I don't know. I think I like theory 2 better. But that's just me. Whatever. All in all, This book was really good. I give it 4.5 stars, even though I only put 4 up there ^^Well, friend me. Unless you're a creeper.

This is probably one of my all time favorite series! I\u2019m almost done with it now though, so that makes me very sad.We are back with Kylie who is finally finding herself. She is starting to really realize who she is, and what she is. She\u2019s still causing trouble with her two best friends. And, than there are the two guys who love her. Derek and Lucas. Oh, how I love thee. I seriously don\u2019t know who I want Kylie with. I like them both for their own reasons, and I just can\u2019t decide. Talk about a love triangle. In Whispers at Moon rise, Kylie is trying to learn more about chameleons. She\u2019s confused by the term and wonders what the heck it really means. She needs to know more about what is going to happen with her and what is already starting too. And, she has to figure out why she keeps seeing a ghost that looks just like someone she knows! Talk about freaky. I feel as though I can\u2019t say much else or I give away too much, especially if you haven\u2019t started this series. If not, you need to now! And that ending. Whoa! I have to start the next book right away! Talk about a cliffhanger that I need to know what happens with Kylie and a certain boy. Overall:I just adore this series.

How do I know that? Just by reading this series you can feel the suspense and thrill of adventure coming off the pages. Your immediately transferred into a world filled with non-stop mystery, drama, romance, and more. It's like the more you read the deeper you get into discovering something new that you never knew was there before. C.C. Hunter's way with fluidity of language in the novel kept me focused the entire time that I was reading. I pretty much got the book in the mail and read it all in that same day without putting it done, that's how brilliant it was!C.C. Hunter knows how to take readers on an emotional rollercoaster; (Like Zayn Malik says \"Just close your eyes and enjoy the rollercoaster that is life\") and that's just what I did when stepping into the world of Shadow Falls. But I have to say the ending caught me off guard. I was not prepared and had been left speechless. All I could think was \"Why?\" and \"I can't believe you would do this\". By the time I could speak all I wanted to do was jump into the story, grab her shoulders shaking her senselessly while yelling in her face \"Are you stupid!? You can't just up and leave! FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU WANT!\" But sadly that can't happen.
