Eternal Vows is not the most innovative and fresh concept books that you may come across as there is nothing new about the story. A woman in search of her long lost sister accidently stumbles upon a portal to another dimension. Getting married to a powerful, immortal and gorgeous King clearly on a case of mistaken identity. Escaping from the clutches of a forced marriage while trying to fight down her undeniable attraction to her husband, slipping on and ancient ring that connects her to him does not help . Ofcourse having a band of enemy immortals on her trail trying to hunt her down once and for all is not exactly a walk in the park. But being married to an immortal has its advantages. For one you also get to be an immortal and get entrusted with all this super powers and mind tricks that you cannot control but may come in handy when you are running for your life. Yes, ETERNAL VOWS has it all and manages to keep it interesting the whole time even though the formula is a little hand me down. But I am not complaining as the saying goes via trita via truta \"a frequented path is a reliable path\" and this frequented path does deserve attention. The writing is engaging and there are a lot of witty banter, funny dialogues and a number of references to the pop culture that you feel like laughing inspite of yourself. Eventhough they are inches away from death the heroine manages to sprout atlest one sentence that is sure to lighten the mood and that is one of the good things about this book. The heroine Sarah is funny and stubborn, there is no other way to define her and the hero, who doesn't like an immortal, gorgeous control freak. If anything, the popularity of the Twilight series has taught us \"Never to underestimate the power of a gorgeous immortal no matter how controlling he is\". So there you have it, Eternal Vows is a book to watch out for if you are looking for pure entertainment and a good laugh."}, {"userName": "Jayde Scott", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4619356-jayde-scott", "userReview": "Ever since her sister disappeared without a trace, Sarah Larker knew something wasn't right so she became a paranormal researcher, hell-bent on finding out what really happened. On yet another investigative mission, Sarah and her researcher team arrive at the scene where her sister was last seen. But something's different this time. They hear strange noises; something's watching them. Not knowing what's going on, Sarah enters the cave and steps through a portal in time. Suddenly, she finds herself in a different world, followed by deadly giants who almost kill her...until she's saved by a mysterious immortal king. Victor claims to know who she is, and even though he despises her for no apparent reason, he wants to make her his. Now Sarah must do everything in her power to stay alive...even if it means marrying the enemy who could find out she's not who he thinks she is...I loved this book. The writing is fantastic. The story building isn't your typical paranormal romance, but includes time travel and mystery elements as Sarah has to find out what really happened to her sister while trying to save her own life. Sarah's such a lovable heroine who cares about others while Victor's strong and determined to crush his enemies and keep the woman he desires. The attraction between the two was sizzling hot. There were quite a few twists and turns I didn't see coming, and the ending left me eager to pick up the next book. All in all, a really good book I'd recommend to readers of paranormal fiction who enjoy a bit of romance, humor and mystery."}, {"userName": "Vanessa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64363186-vanessa", "userReview": "This book is not perfect and it has some flaws, but I really enjoyed it!The situation of a woman travelling through a portal into another time or dimension is already well known, but I definitely enjoyed that this time the main character isn't alone in that other dimension. She has her friends with her to help her and to accompany her on this journey. Also she quickly finds allies in that new world, though I must admit that I find it somewhat hard to believe that people from a medieval world would trust a complete stranger that fast and would risk their lifes to help her escape from the king. Another flaw I see in this book is Sarah's behaviour. I think she is naive and stubborn. She doesn't listen to people who have clearly more knowledge of that world. She accepts her powers and the creatures in that world without a second thought, but does not accept any help. She gets her friends and herself into trouble with that behaviour, but it doesn't seem to bother her.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the story very much. Since this book is only the first one in a series I am sure that there is a lot of potential to explore the world more and to develop the characters.

I am telling you not only is this a totally original idea that made me go, \"Ah man, why can't cool stuff like this happen to ME!\" But it had me marveling at how well written this paranormal fantasy romance story was. I was sucked in from beginning to end and I really struggled to put the book down. At one point I realized I had to sleep, it was 2AM, and the moment I woke up I finished it, then screamed when it ended and instantly went and bought book two.

Seperated from each other, they have to find their way in a whole new dimension, that's not only appears to be stuck in the Middle Ages, it's also filled and reigned by supernatural forces. Sarah, mistaken for the princess of a rivaling kingdom, is forced to marry King Victor to save her own life. Her plan to wed and run with some outside help, turns out to be much more difficult than she could have ever expected. Not only is her new husband chasing after her, others are too...*** The summary of Eternal Vows seems very promising for a nice little read, some unlikely romance in a mysterious setting and a female protagonist turned accidental hero that has to figure her place in this new setting out. Unfortunately, as it turns out, that really was all just wishful thinking on my part. Sarah Larker, who, although we are told that she is oh so lovely, caring and likeable, turns out to be a na\u00ecve and flighty character with a hang for dramatics. As much as I tried (and I really did) I just couldn't find it in me to connect with her, and least of all like her. Actually, none of the characters introduced enticed any kind of redeeming quality. The only maybe-exception being King Viktor, the Immortal, but even so, his appearances were short and in between. Mostly, and this can be applied also for Sarah and Frank, Sarah's kinda-ex-but-kinda-not, who completes the love-triangle, are flat any annoying.It's not only the bland characters that bothered me, though. There are also these awful dialogues which, I'm sure, were meant to be as funny-silly-cute, as the characters themselves were supposed to come across as, but really, really didn't. For instance, Frank, who seemed unable to open his mouth and not say something cheesy and all-around improper considering the situations they happened to find themselves in. His attempts at flirting are plump and bothersome, but constant. Generally, most of the sutuations they found themselves in were filled with dialoges that didn't quite match the setting/situation. Then there is the part where the story is set in a land stuck in some Medieval times, but except for a few occasions, none of the locals seem to be that bothered by the appearance, behavior or language of the foreigners. Foreigners, who can't really be bothered investing too much effort into blending in and finding cover. Every now and then, someone will ask what a certain word means, but it happens so randomly, it feels like the author herself forgot about the setting. Everything just seems too raw and too much of a mess, more like a first draft than a finished story. There are several different ideas and aspects of the story, that would have actually worked out well, had more time and thought been put into the execution and writing! Really, the whole part about the Immortals, the portal and that connection formed through the ring, make for a good story, but as it was displayed in this book (and I can only judge from this book alone) all the good ideas drown in this wild mess of everything I mentioned above. Whether you write Fantasy or not, a certain amount of sense for characters, settings, actions, situations and dialogues, is needed. I'm not intending to sound mean to the author or anything here, I'm just very saddened and disappointed to see the good ideas displayed having gone to waste. 1,5 stars."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6691610-wendy", "userReview": "I really can't wait to continue this series. There is something about the story that plunges me into a world that's mystical, enigmatic and addictive. After being transported through a portal with no hope of return. Sarah larker finds herself married to a possessive king whilst getting herself tangled in a war between immortal kings. From the moment i read the blurb, i thought...  WOW.AWESOME.COOL The second you read this blurb is the second you realize that nothing can really go wrong with this book: I mean who doesn't want a powerful king to be their husband? Think of all the couture dresses, Prada, Gucci and angry sex (nothing can go wrong with angry sex). Well unfortunately this king is an over a century years old immortal being and the wedding ring he gives to Sarah, just happened to turn her into an immortal. So Sarah is on the run with Mr-royal-pain-in-the-a**, a council of immortal rulers and another enemy kingdom hot on her trail. Will Sarah survive with nothing but her smart mouth, her big fat wedding ring, her ex-boyfriend Frank and a tranquilizer?This a very short story and despite its interesting and semi-original plot, the story manages to dive into intricate subplot to enhance the story with ease. The transition and contrast between Sarah's modern lifestyle and the fantasy aspect of the story was hilarious and quite realistic. And yes the notorious: \"Is this a film?\" speech or \"Where are the cameras?\" monologue are provided. Despite having to be in dire situations, Sarah and Frank brings humour in abundance. All the pop cultural references and snarky remarks made me laugh with tears. They are funny and quirky, and loosened the tension between the readers and the book. There is a slight love triangle and a perfect a hue of fiery/hot/passionate scenes that involves our egotistical immortal king. Victor is someone we didn't get a lot of and I guess i wouldn't mind seeing more of him. Sarah has something in her that made her my new best friend. And Frank can just....he can just stay with me because every time he talks, he enlightens the most suffocating environment.[spoilers removed]Thumbs up to Christina Peebles.

I was so looking forward to reading it after reading the summary but soon learned that not enough time had been given to forging relationships between the appropriate characters.Sarah is on the hunt to prove Bigfoot exists. Unfortunately, a former boyfriend, Frank is a journalist/ reporter who sets out to debunk every case she and her team investigate. When Sarah and her team believe they finally have proof of Bigfoot's existence, Frank shows up once again. She thinks the creature is hiding out in the cave her sister, Liz went missing from years prior. Frank and Sarah enter the cave only to realize it is a portal to a different world.Once they are on the side, Sarah is mistaken for a missing princess. She meets Prince Victor who informs her of his plans to marry her. Sarah and Frank concoct a plan to obtain the wedding ring that is needed to return them to their realm. However, the only way for her to get it is to truly marry Victor. Little does Sarah know but the wedding ceremony and kiss she and Victor share will be enough to bind them together for life.While I did enjoy this book somewhat, I also had problems with Sarah and Victor's attraction towards one another. Quite honestly I didn't really care about either of them because the author did not really write any scenes with them together long enough to develop any chemistry. Much of the book is spent describing Sarah's various brushes with enemy after enemy and not enough time was invested in relationship building. The plot had so much potential but began to fall apart with each new creature introduced or special ability Sarah develops. At times I felt as if I was reading a YA book rather than and adult read.

For being a solid 8, maybe 9, on the Fluffy scale, I found the characters incredibly engaging. There was some friction throughout that I think is a key factor in what made them interesting. And by friction, I mean, some of the things they did and said got on my nerves but in a way that made them slightly more real and kept them from being flat.The storyline was also really engaging. I've not previously run across a paranormal romance with quite this layout and hook. The politics and plot all interplayed very nicely and didn't stomp themselves into any major potholes. It was an engaging enough storyline that I immediately paid for book 2.And, Bigfoot!!! Awesome.Things I didn't like: No ending. I hate books that end with a cliff hanger and literally \"to be continued.\" As this was a kindle freebie, I felt less jipped than I would otherwise and between them, felt I was getting a decent value by buying book 2. I was pretty sure I wouldn't want to read book 3, so the price was right when averaged out.Frank really got on my nerves. It was clearly intentional and an effective foil, so that's more of a plus than a negative, but wow did I want to stuff a sock in that guy's mouth.It went too far into eye rolling territory for me. I expect and therefore forgive a certain amount of eye rolling in a fluffy book. This slightly exceeded my acceptable Fluffy to Eye Rolling ratio, acceptable being roughly 0.70.

I enjoyed the book so much that I blew through it in less than 24 hours and was left wanting more. The author has an engaging style of writing, a lot of imagination, and knows how to inject the right amount of humor and pathos in a story. Sarah is a likable, self-deprecating heroine, so it was fun to spend time with her and see how she managed to extricate herself from all of the dangerous situations she found herself in.The character who intrigued me most in Eternal Vows was King Victor, the immortal whom Sarah marries out of desperation and finds herself forever bonded to. Powerful, magnetic, and more than a little bit scary, Victor could have very well been the villain of the piece, but there was so much spark between Victor and Sarah that I found myself hoping he wouldn't turn out to be all bad. I guess I'll find out exactly what his motivations are and how he really feels about Sarah in book two of the series, Eternal Destiny.

What is interesting about it is that the story has the basic backbones to be a very good fantasy story, but the attempt at humor takes away from this completely. I alternated between laughing at a joke, then rolling my eyes for the next three pages of nonstop corny jokes. I think the book tries too hard to be funny, when it would still be just as good of a satire if all the bad jokes were cut and a bit more seriousness was put in their place. The whole book could have used a final edit; there are so many inconsistencies that distract from the flow of the story- for instance, at one point Sarah is described as putting her hands behind her back, then in the next sentence her hand is described as still being held.
