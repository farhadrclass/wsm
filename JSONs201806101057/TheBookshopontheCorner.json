A very bookish best friend. The best possible kind of best friend.Nina is was a librarian.  Her job was her everything. She spent every waking moment, caring for all of the little library books, curling up with a new novel every night and most importantly, helping people find the book that they needed the most.  Books were her everything. \nfor Nina, whenever reality, or the grimmer side of reality, threatened to invade, she always turned to a book...They had mended her heart when it was broken, and encouraged her to hope when she was down. \nBut all that vanished. All that comfort and security from her library job - snuffed out. And Nina is just reeling and the midst of her panic, she comes to a realization (with the help of her friend):\nJust do something. You might make a mistake, then you can fix it. But if you do nothing, you can't fix anything. And your life might turn out full of regrets.\n So, armed with an unwieldy old van and far more books than one can imagine, Nina sets off to explore the countryside - selling her books at farmers markets and festivals, all the while blossoming from a shy, timid librarian to the woman she was always meant to be.I absolutely adored this story. The romance was so well done - it was one of those romances where you fall in love with the way they're falling in love. And the books (so many books!) just cinched the novel for me. I want to go out and check out every last book from the library that Nina suggests. As an aside, I loved the way the author dedicated the book. \nThere is no dedication in this book because the entire book is dedicated to you: the reader. To all readers.Because this book is about reading and books, and how these things can change your life, always, I would argue, for the better....\n The 2018 PopSugar Reading Challenge - A book that involves a library or bookstoreAudiobook CommentsAn absolute pleasure to listen to - thank you Lucy Price-Lewis.

Most kids sleep with stuffed animals, but I slept with some book or another even before I could read them for myself. I was born with an intense love for words and the worlds that writers can craft with them. Because of that fervent adoration for all things books, I delight in finding books about books. Sadly though, more often than not the books-about-books that I pick up tend to leave me disappointed. There are a few exceptions, of course; The Shadow of the Wind, The Neverending Story, and Inkheart being a few that made me so happy that my heart felt as though surely it would burst. But others, such as Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, Fangirl, and this one, all left me feeling unsatisfied. The first set of books were truly odes to the power of books. Books were conveyed as important, friends to be treasured and revisited as often as possible. The second set of books I listed started out that way. But, eventually, books cease being viewed as treasures and are viewed instead as crutches, things only clung to by those who aren't truly living their own lives and thus have to live vicariously through the stories of others. I disagree with that view of books vehemently. Yes, books are a safe place to turn to when you\u2019re lonely or in pain. I can logically agree that books are sometimes used as crutches to help us get through life. My problem with that line of thinking is this; what on earth is wrong with crutches?! I would rather have something to lean on that helps me walk steadily and securely through my life than hobble because I\u2019m too proud to use a crutch. Besides that, in the words of George R.R. Martin, \u201cA reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.\u201dNow, onto the actual book I\u2019m supposed to be reviewing. The Bookshop on the Corner was really cute, especially through the first half. Nina, our main character, was faced with a huge change in her life, and she made the most of it by embracing her love of books and her dream of fostering that love in others by opening her own book shop. Her bookshop wasn\u2019t conventional, and neither was the community she moved to in order to open it, but it suited her well. She had a cast of cute and sometimes crazy friends and patrons who for the most part were incredibly supportive. Nina\u2019s favorite thing in the world was literary matchmaking, pairing a person with the perfect book for where they were in their life. That is, until love derailed her life. (Those of you who have read this, I hope you liked my pun there!) And that\u2019s where the book let me down, where it shifted from a love story about books to just being a love story with a few books scattered here and there. And the love story was my most hated trope, a love triangle. Both guys were cute and all, I just can't stand love triangles for some reason. They make my lip curl. Also, I\u2019ve become spoiled to the phenomenal writing found in fantasy nowadays, and the writing in this book fell flat for me comparatively. This story was light and cute and sweet, but it just felt like consuming empty calories."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13060256-elaine", "userReview": "This is a really lovely read and I cannot think of anything I didn\u2019t like about it. It is the story of Nina, a Librarian who is made redundant from her job in Birmingham, who starts a new life for herself by buying a van in Scotland and transforming it into a mobile bookshop.The characters are all people you just cannot help liking and Nina herself is someone you would just love to be friends with in real life. I adored the setting in the Scottish Highlands which are beautifully described, especially the scenery although the Highland dancing and the Midsummer Festival celebrations were fantastic to read about. The author just made me want to cram a load of books into our camper van and head off up there myself to start my own bookshop! It is a story which just oozes romance of the non predictable kind \u2013 you are really kept guessing for quite a large part of the read as to what is going to happen. There is the lovely mix of misunderstandings and red herrings, which really kept my interest throughout.It is a definite curl up on the sofa read, one you can totally lose yourself in.

The title alone was enough to catch my eye. I love 'books about books' and this one will truly resonate with people like me, who live and breathe books, no matter what genre you prefer. When Nina loses her beloved job at the library, she finds the courage to start her life over using her expert skills of matching people with books. She buys a van and moves to Scotland and becomes a successful book seller. But, the journey is fraught with setbacks, adjustments, and a flood of personal turmoil as she settles into a small Scottish community and begins spreading the love of books and reading with the folks who live there. Nina\u2019s character slowly blossoms, as she faces a few hard knocks, and meets those challenges with more fortitude than she thought possible. Her adventures are often hilarious, sometimes poignant, but her kindness and honesty touches an entire community, as well as the heart of a certain gentleman, making her a true inspiration. This \u2018feel good\u2019 story naturally appealed to the book lover in me. Nina and I, could be two peas in a pod, and I instantly related to her, often smiling and nodding when her exuberance for books popped off the page.  While I took great pleasure in watching Nina tirelessly spread the gift of books to her isolated community, the story evolves into something more, proving that people can work together to resolve problems if only they would try to see things from a perspective other than their own. It\u2019s also about having the courage to pursue your dreams, for not settling or giving up, no matter how bleak things seem at the time. All the characters are slightly quirky, and are well drawn, with compelling stories of the their own, adding much depth, charm, and warmth to this delightful tale. This is a quick and easy read, is very light hearted and witty, and is sure to lift your spirits and solidify your love of reading and books and of course recommending them to all your friends, family and community. Overall, anyone will like this book, I think, but contemporary romance readers and chick-lit fans will definitely want to check this one out. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "Okay, so you get The Bookshop on the Corner by Jenny Colgan, and then you get:The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry by Gabrielle ZevinThe Salinger Contract by Adam LangerAn Unnecessary Woman by Rabih Alameddine The Little Paris Bookshop by Nina GeorgeThe Bookshop by Penelope Fitzgerald Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore #1 by Robin SloanI just wondered what the hell happened?There's no comparison. This book is serious chick lit fluff, you know, a young jobless woman in distress, penniless and desperate to start over after losing her job in a library. She ventures off on an adventure and then steps in a Scottish sheep farmer who pulls her in behind a tree and 'take' her, oh how utterly exciting, and then the hunk and the cutie live happily ever after. How they met was kind of cute too.But there's the train, called  The Lady of Argyll and a book bus for the remote small villages of Scotland. Add to that Men Central where there were none before, and you've got it made in lalaland of romance and love.In the heat of the moment, no pun intended, there were lots of goodies the young lady had stored which she could use to turn the old bread van into a cozy bookstore. Problem is, for someone living on a minuscule salary, it did not make sense to buy all these paraphernalia, beanie bags, fairy lights, fluorescent lights spelling \"Books\" and some more, and hoard it in a tiny apartment without knowing what to do with them. Did not make sense. Contrived. By this point in the book, I was kind of getting bored. It's hard to convince a experienced farm woman, like yours truly, that a big van, the size of a bus, or truck, will not break down, with expensive repairs, expensive new tyres, expensive engine repairs, expensive licensing and insurance (if you can get any on such an old vehicle)...AND EXPENSIVE FUEL CONSUMPTION. Old ones are the worst. Not toys for girls with a dream. So yes, THAT did not make sense as well. Oh well, this book was not meant to be so grounded in reality, so let's move on, shall we? It is a girlie fairytale after all. And it was okay to name this old hag on four gigantic wheels Little Shop of Happy-Ever-After with a chandelier inside to boot.But don't despair, it's a feel-good read for romance junkies. Probably a five star thrill. The books were great props for the romantic drama. That's all it was. Quite a drama it was, for sure.So with a huff and a puff the coupling dance was over, thank the almighty stars, and life could happily continue in the wilds of the great valleys and deep lochs of Scotland. For me too. Why do I suddenly feel so old? And grumpy? ***SIGH***I liked the idea of a book van in Kirrinfief, and Scotland, and small towns and...and...and...well, a place to explore. Using this beautiful country with its eccentric, delightful characters to fill up the background of this story, was a very good idea in my book. And I will certainly love to know how to make the cucumber and green cabbage salad with fennel, orange, and oats.THREE STARS means OKAY! It was OKAY. Fun really. I'm in a good mood. And I LOVED the idea of a book van!!!

I was a public services librarian for 42 years and a bookmobile librarian for of 17 of those years, so the thoughts about helping patrons find just the right books to read really resonated. The setting in Scotland was very appealing (as were the love interests!) and I'm ready to book a trip!The theme of reinventing your life in the book world reminded me of Anjali Banerjee's Haunting Jasmine, only without a supernatural element.Recommended for readers' advisory librarians and anyone else who loves a sweet comfort read featuring hunky men and appealing book descriptions.

Nina was a mousy bore and clumsy idiot to boot. The only parts where she was interesting was when she was trying to change her life and was in the process of moving to rural Scotland to sell books out of a van. As soon as the love interests came on the scene, Nina lost what little charm she had and turned into a pathetic, desperate, whiny, doormat who panted between a bitter, mean, divorced mess and a married creep. The romance ruined what could have been a half decent book, I didn't want to read about a dull doormat chasing after a guy who spent half his time bitching at her and the other half the time ignoring her.

But not QUITE my style any more, I have to say, even though I did read the Cinderella story to the end, especially since part way I realized that it was a bit of a take on that lovely old tale, Parnussus on Wheels by Christopher Morley. Nina Redmond is a victim of Britain's branch library cuts - wee local libraries serving walk-in clientele within a neighbourly vicinity, from the stroller pushers to those with walkers. (I didn't know such places existed!). Found unsuitable for the high energy, high tech central system, Nina decides that she will operate a mobile bookstore. One thing leads to another - like the van is SO big for parking on Birmingham's city streets - and she ends up in Kirrinfief, Scotland. Scotland makes out very well in this book by Jenny Colgan, who extolls its beauty and raininess and its close sense of small town community. Add the farm fresh eggs, homemade sausage, smoked bacon, local baking... in very good taste, for sure. And, oh yes, its freckled charming Scottish men. So, love will out, everyone wins, kisses are fine... but the food made me drool.

Her love note to the art of reading and all the books in the world instantly got my attention and put a smile on my face.

I ended up enjoying it more than I ever thought I would. This is the type book you pick up when you are in a reading slump or need to clean your palette after reading a number of intense books. I think it started very slow and came off as a very fluffy romance novel, however there was just seemed to be a tugging thread that kept me returning to the page. In addition to being a light read in a very fanciful script, in retrospect I see a number of societal issues, hovering in the background, that the book did cover. Highlighted was child services, job loss and reinvention, divorce and new relationships, deportation and the strength of community, among others. Nina in the throes of losing her library job decided to buy a van and start a rolling bookstore. Little did she know that this escapade would lead her to a new community, a new culture and a new love.

Ever heard of Bloke-lit? No, neither have I. But the label Chick-lit probable puts off a lot of men from reading them and that's a pity. I came across Jenny Colgan's work through the pages of a Rosie Hopkins story and I was hooked. This latest offering from Jenny is just as enjoyable. I love books (don't we all?), I love people who love books and I have a certain envy of those who own and run a bookshop. So, how about a mobile bookshop? Nina Redmond is 29 years old. The library where she works is to be closed, like so many, and Nina finds herself facing a bleak future in Birmingham where she lives. The library services are to be compressed into the centre of town where they would become a 'hub' with a 'multimedia experience zone'. Ugh! Not for Nina who is caught looking at adverts for large vans for sale, by her friend Griffin. A mobile bookshop? Why the hell not? There are thousands of books available as the library is closing. The snag though is that the van that really catches Nina's eye is in Scotland...And thereby lies the tale of another delicious read from Jenny Colgan. What's not to like about a bibliophile selling books from a van, following her trials and tribulations and her love life, as it is, in the Highlands?

I checked this book out from the library because it sounded kind of like my life. For me, everything changed when I had to leave my job at an independent bookstore and then when it closed down for good. I had a great memory for where each book was, often what it looked like, who wrote it, what series it was in, what order the series went in, authors' pseudonyms, and what books people might like if they liked this book or that. My favourite was giving recommendations, helping people find just the right book for a friend in the hospital with depression or child about to become a big brother or sister. When I left to give birth it was a huge adjustment to be home all of the time with a baby who wanted to eat nonstop and would only sleep in my arms. My world shrunk by the day, especially once we got down to one working car. Now with my girl in Kindergarten, I am being told by doctors that I will never work again. So I thought this book might cheer me up, give me some inspiration, etc.And it did, at first. I could identify with Nina from the beginning, though not with her obsession with Heathcliffe and Christian Gray, who I consider to be dangerous criminals in need of locking up, not romantic heroes. Despite apparently having been around the block a time or two and in her 30s, Nina seems more naive and childish than I was as a 23 year old virgin bride. I completely understand her love of books and her huge hoard of them, of course--I have an entire room in my house dedicated to nothing else. But she is somehow able to sell all of her books once she realizes there's a profit to be made. What kind of real book fanatic could do that unless they were on the verge of starvation or something?So Nina loses her library job in Birmingham, spends everything she's got to buy a van in Scotland and of course ends up moving there, getting an amazingly designed, perfect apartment in a barn for next to nothing. Oh, and it comes with a tall handsome Scotsman who has a sweet dog and adorable lambs. But of course, he's also a jerk who doesn't like books or English city girls and never fails to be gruff or downright rude.The business takes off immediately because it's that kind of book, despite the fact that Nina names her mobile bookshop The Little Shop of Happy Ever After (which makes me want to puke), and everything is just peachy, except that Nina can't see the mysterious dark Latvian train engineer dude she's projected fictional characters onto often enough to suit her. But her landlord calls her over to deliver stuck twin lambs because she is the only one around with small enough hands. That just didn't seem likely to me. \"I don't like you, you're useless, you're dangerous, but come over here and soap up and shove your hands up inside my ewe.\" Right.Basically, what I found annoying about this book is that no matter how awkward and idiotic Nina is, everything she does always works out. She loves literally everything about where she lives in Scotland--sorry, but there are down sides to everywhere. Her book recommendations, even when absurdly personal to the point of being potentially insulting, all turn out better than normal...it just goes on. It was still a pleasant enough read though, until about the last quarter.SPOILERSNaturally there is something wrong with the handsome sad foreigner--he already has a family back home. You begin to realize this is a weird retelling of Pride and Prejudice and he was Mr. Wickham. Which makes the landlord, Lennox, Mr. Darcy. *sigh* There's even a bunch of stuff about dancing and not dancing, and you also get to see that Lennox is nicer than he seems, though he still talks in a pretty unfriendly way.When Lennox's ex shows up and demands the farm, she is over the top, completely silly and out of place even in this unrealistic book. She even throws a rare priceless book of Nina's into the mud. So Nina offers to give up her lovely apartment in the barn and move in with Lennox, who she is now sleeping with nonstop. By this point that is pretty much all she does. They don't talk, they have nothing in common to talk about, but they \"don't need to talk\" because their connection is suddenly so deep. Yeah bloody right. To me this is the laziest trick in the book. And it furthers what I think is a dangerous myth, that sex is the same thing as true love. Also the one that if someone is rude, hurtful, and has nothing in common with us, they must be our soulmate. We're supposed to be happy because Nina gets to constantly have sex with her grumpy boyfriend who only reads the occasional agriculture magazine. Seriously, how long is that going to work out? It definitely doesn't seem like the kind of \"happy ever after\" Nina was looking for.Oh, and Nina ends up getting a new copy of the rare and priceless book the ex destroyed. And she loses the apartment but her best friend moves into it. So absolutely nothing is lost or sacrificed unless you count a diseased tree. Nothing whatever mars her happiness ever.

My most adamant criticism is the ridiculous U.S. branding of this book."}, {"userName": "Magdalena aka A Bookaholic Swede", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379514-magdalena-aka-a-bookaholic-swede", "userReview": "Dual review with Swedish first and then English!\nSWEDISH REVIEW\n\u00c4nnu en fulltr\u00e4ff!

After reading two books in the Little Beach Street Bakery trilogy, was I really looking forward to reading this book. I mean, just the title The Little Shop of Happy Ever After is lovely. The question was, would this book be as charming as the Little Beach Street Bakery books? Can Nina charm me as much as Polly did? And would a book without Neil the Puffin work?In fact, The Little Shop of Happy Ever After is a very lovely book charming, but not at all without depth, just what I had hoped for. Sometimes feel good books may be too saccharin, but Jenny Colgan knows how to write a book that blends humor and seriousness and I could recognize so much in this book. Both as regards to reading, but also living in a society where centralization and downsizing are a fact.I really like the thought of a book bus that prompts people in a small village to start reading again. I recognize traits in this book from the Little Beach Street Bakery, such as That Nina getting the attention of two different men Just like Polly got in the Little Beach Street Bakery books. However, the similarities do not matter, I do not even mind the triangle drama, I liked both Marek and Lennox, they are like two opposites, the question is who Nina will fall for? You have to read the book to find out.The Little Shop of Happy Ever After feels like a perfect summer book, it's easy-going, fast-paced, but not at a book that you forget!Thanks to Massolit F\u00f6rlag for the review copy!"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2252657-kim", "userReview": "You always know you are in for a real treat with a new Jenny Colgan book and this one was about a booklover who decides to run a mobile bookshop in Scotland.

She can match readers to the perfect book for them to read. This is why she makes such a wonderful librarian. Unfortunately, the library she works at in Birmingham, England is closing and a huge corporation is taking over with a media center. A job and place she would definitely not be suited to work.Overall, Nina is a quiet woman who doesn\u2019t take risks. Now, due to necessity, things are changing. She needs a new career and job. To top it all off, her roommate becomes so annoyed with all the books stored in their small apartment, that she asks Nina to find a new place to live. This forces Nina to make even more decisions.Librarians are not in high demand any longer. So, she decides to buy a van and make a bookmobile out of it. The perfect available van to buy is in Scotland. After giving it much thought, she decides to go for it. She buys the van and stays in Scotland. She rides from town to town recommending and selling books.Along the way Nina meets some very interesting people such as an angry landlord and a train conductor willing to help smuggle books to her van.This is one heroine I truly could identify with \u2013 I just wish I was able to take a risk and open my own bookstore. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like driving a van, but a small bookstore would be more my speed \uf04aOkay, back to this book. It\u2019s a charming story of a woman who loses everything and is able to pick herself up and start over. That\u2019s really the main point. Not only does she start over, she does it by doing something she loves \u2013 recommending and selling books. It\u2019s a heartwarming book with quirky, eccentric and fascinating characters. Each one has a story of their own. I did feel like the book was slow in a couple of spots, but nothing that prevented me from enjoying the book.One thing I found odd is the title. There is no \u201cBookshop on the Corner\u201d. It\u2019s a bookmobile which travels from town to town. So, that could be misleading. The cover works perfectly with the title, but neither works with the storyline. Not a big deal, but it is noticeable.This is the first book I\u2019ve read by this author. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading more books by her.FTC Disclosure: The publicist and Edelweiss provided me with a copy of this book to review.

That being said, I love this book. I started it at 3 am when I could not sleep, and none of my current books enticed me. I found myself drawn in, and loved the characters, the framework, and especially the area in Scotland once the story became based there. A story about picking one's self up after an unforeseen change and taking the risk to make one's dream come true is a lovely one. The fact that our heroine's dream brings pleasure to so many others is wonderful, as well. This book might be too \"sweet\" for some, but it was just what I needed. Are not books magical that way?

I always find myself instantly engrossed in books ABOUT books and I can't help but feel connected to people\u2026. even if they ARE FICTIONAL PEOPLE \u2026 who love books as much as I do.This charming story began in a library in Birmingham, England. Twenty-nine year old librarian Nina Redmond is a library 'matchmaker' of sorts. She was especially skilled at being able to match every person with whom she came into contact with the perfect book. Unfortunately, as is the case with many libraries, budget cuts had diminished Nina's library and it would soon be rebranded and reopened as a \"multimedia experience zone.\" The employees of the library, including Nina, would have to reapply and interview for potential jobs at this multimedia center. Nina was apprehensive\u2026 she had only ever wanted to be a librarian, a guardian of books and she took her job very seriously. But Nina also had a dream.. just a little dream that she held close to her heart and had never spoken of it to anyone. Eventually, the day of Nina's interview arrived but as soon as the interview began, Nina immediately knew she would not be rehired but more importantly, Nina realized with some surprise that she didn't even CARE that she would no longer be employed. She had been thinking more and more about her dream of opening her very own little bookshop on a corner.. continuing to match books to the people who needed them. Deciding she had nothing to lose, she took every last cent she had and purchased a huge white van and with the extensive collection of books she had been accumulating over the years she, along with the help of some friends, turned that simple white van into a bookmobile of sorts.. a bookmobile which happened to be the epitome of Nina's dreams and hopes for the future; a bookmobile which would also be a reminder of her many hours spent lost in the worlds you can only find in the pages of good books. Fittingly, Nina called this rolling book store the \"Little Shop of Happily Ever After\". Nina and her bookshop ended up in a village in the Scottish Highlands, which was the very place she had discovered the van which had enabled her to launch her dream. The sailing wasn't always smooth for Nina\u2026 she had obstacles to overcome, some more challenging than others. Needing to find a place to live, she found herself on a farm owned by a grumpy and heartbroken man named Lennox. She found the isolation and smallness of the village a particular challenge as she was used to city living. And of course, she had left her friends behind as well. But when opening day finally arrived for the \"Little Shop of Happily Ever After\", she was stunned and gratified to be met by villagers who were starved for stories. THe village's little library had been closed years before and she realized that her 'matchmaking' skills were sorely needed.Although the basic message of this novel is about having the courage to reinvent yourself.. to pull those dreams out, dust them off and persevere until they have been realized\u2026 to me, the best part of this story was the books\u2026 and the people who hungered for them. Human beings crave stories and as Nina knew so well, the stories provided in books are the best way for people to bridge the gap between the lives they lead and the lives they never imagined could be possible. There were a couple of things about this book that struck me.. first, the title is misleading. Of course there IS no bookshop on ANY corner. Secondly, Nina's ability to just somehow acquire books for restocking her own shelves seemed a bit implausible to me. But really, this story, although a simple one, was pure joy for me to read. And while listening to this story, I couldn't help but be reminded again and again of a quote by Stephen King\u2026 \"Books are a uniquely portable magic\". I would say that this author Jenny Colgan wholeheartedly agrees."}], "description": "Nina Redmond is a literary matchmaker.
