The short stories are actually very short, full of dreamy atmosphere and surrealist images. You get the sense that they were not finished, that they needed one last look from the author or maybe it is his own experimental style that leaves that impression.The translation is very good and you can tell that the three translators really loved this work. Also, there is artwork by Paul Klee, which fits perfectly to the context and I am sure will look great on the printed book. All in all, an interesting collection, not exactly for everyone, but worth discovering.Many thanks to Verso books for providing this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Dan Hamilton", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36908780-dan-hamilton", "userReview": "This collection is stunning. As Elif Shafak once said of Benjamin, \"One doesn't read him to feel better \u2013 one reads him to feel.\" This has never been more true than it is with his fiction, which we are seeing for the first time here. I am eagerly anticipating returning to these stories, fragments, and essays for a long time to come."}, {"userName": "Sean A.", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5843895-sean-a", "userReview": "What a delight.

While there are certainly some chapters that are not to my liking or less of interest to me, there are a serious number that I will be returning to again."}, {"userName": "Jack Waters", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3663641-jack-waters", "userReview": "Perhaps this assessment is unfair since I am a huge fan of Illuminations and The Arcades Project, but I was not blown away by these stories of fiction. The novellas, fables, histories, aphorisms, parables, and riddles are interesting but do not hold the same weight as his cultural critiques. Perhaps this is a book reserved for Benjamin completionists or those who've never read him."}, {"userName": "Colin Cox", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50921106-colin-cox", "userReview": "Weaving together a collection of disparate stories, essays, and reviews of a writer or thinker without his or her expressed consent is a tricky operation. If successful, the collection clarifies a set of ideas and concepts relevant to the writer in question that would otherwise remain opaque or invisible. In addition, such collections may open new territories of inquiry about the author in question. Although, if such a project fails, the writer becomes increasingly distant, drifting beyond our comprehension and confirming our worst impulses which the following sentiment approximates: I simply won't get them!There is, however, another category, and that category represents my reaction to The Storyteller: Tales of Loneliness by Walter Benjamin. Here's the thing: I like Benjamin, I have studied Benjamin, but I would not under any circumstances characterize myself as comfortably familiar with the scope of his profoundly mesmerizing body of work. I am a Benjamin tourist, therefore, The Storyteller: Tales of Loneliness leaves me befuddled but not discouraged. I concurrently want to read this collection again while also reading more of Benjamin's critical work. I want to understand how his fiction informs and illuminates his nonfiction. So, to some degree, after reading The Storyteller: Tales of Loneliness I don't comprehend more about Benjamin than I did before, but that doesn't mean I'm rolling my eyes. If anything, my eyes are focused, steady, and longing to hover over a copy of Arcades Project."}, {"userName": "Tom Timmermans", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16782690-tom-timmermans", "userReview": "Only interesting to those already familiar with Walter Benjamin's output, and despite some interesting bits of writing here and there, it feels like the editors pieced some leftover writings and scribbles together to be able to publish and sell another book. Despite good intentions, the editors seem to have had too few to work on in their effort to really show \"a different side\" of a man who already has a very diverse body of work as a writer, scholar, philosopher and cultural critic. Illuminations and Reflections are considered anthologies that provide a clearer idea of who Walter Benjamin was and what he stood for, and might therefore be a better introduction to him and his works, culminating in what is considered his magnum opus, The Arcades Project, of course."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8035826-kevin", "userReview": "weirdo exercises in style that mostly left no impression on me"}, {"userName": "Theediscerning", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31778097-theediscerning", "userReview": "Purely for those with a great appreciation for the most minor of small works and narrative fragments, and definitely for the scholar rather than the general reader."}], "description": "A beautiful collection of the legendary thinker\u2019s short storiesThe Storyteller gathers for the first time the fiction of the legendary critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin, best known for his groundbreaking studies of culture and literature, including Illuminations, One-Way Street and The Arcades Project. His stories revel in the erotic tensions of city life, cross the threshold between rational and hallucinatory realms, celebrate the importance of games, and delve into the peculiar relationship between gambling and fortune-telling, and explore the themes that defined Benjamin.
