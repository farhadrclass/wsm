But you know what I\u2019ve learned? It wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against the drama of Roman, Greek and Egyptian politics back in the day (I mean wayyyy back). Those people were a hot mess. Times three. Killing anyone and everyone. Marrying for alliances, then divorcing for the same reason. Bribing for power, betraying for the same and any other shenanigans you can think of.Once again Tracy L. Higley brings to life this era and several well known historical characters. And y\u2019all it was a fabulous read!As always, Higley\u2019s research proves well done, with a story rich in detail, yet not overwhelming. The story spans several years and while quite often, this gets drawn out and drags a story along, that wasn\u2019t the case with this read.With characters you love (or instantly hate), The Queen\u2019s Handmaid, will take you deep into the politics of the day, faith and trusting God\u2019s plan will always prevail. P.S. I forgot all the drama, bribery and scheming that made up much of the Roman Empire. It\u2019s a miracle anyone ever trusted anyone!Have you had a chance to read Higley\u2019s work yet? If you\u2019re a historical fiction fan, then you must check out her books!(Thank you Litfuse and Thomas Nelson for the copy in exchange for my honest review)Originally posted at http://booksandbeverages.org/2014/04/..."}, {"userName": "Jessie  (Ageless Pages Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863162-jessie-ageless-pages-reviews", "userReview": "Meh.

I rarely give one star, normally reserving it for when I truly don\u2019t have anything good to say about a book, and this, sadly, is one of those cases. Every time I put it down, it pained me to think that I had to go back to it, I literally did it grumbling. But I\u2019m too stubborn to leave unfinished books, even when I truly wanted to drop this one every few pages, and never pick it up again. The Queen\u2019s Handmaid has the merit of being the only book that ever kept me up at night in a bad way, because I just wanted to finish it to be over with it, or I would have to bear another day of trudging through this story. A quick disclaimer: in this review, I won\u2019t be delving into this story's historical or biblical accuracy, because I simply don\u2019t know enough about those topics as to make a valid point. With that said, let\u2019s dive in.This book wasn\u2019t a nightmare, but a sedative. It is probably one of the slowest I\u2019ve ever read, and after four hundred pages of absolute boredom, I have a few things to say. The Queen\u2019s Handmaid feels more like a history book than a novel, and precisely, it should have the opposite effect. Simply put, if I wanted a history lesson, that\u2019s what I would have read, but I grabbed a novel instead. As I passed the pages, I often had to re-read chunks of information and paragraphs because my mind wandered, and if your thoughts are clearly more interesting than the words you are reading, I think that speaks volumes. One of the first confusing things I found was the dialogue between royalty and servants, as it felt informal, and way too modern for the time period. Perhaps it\u2019s just me, but I think that, in other stories, if a servant talked to a royal the way it happens in this book from time to time, they would probably be executed, or at least severely punished. And although, yes, Cleopatra executes this Andromeda girl on the spot for that, we don\u2019t ever see something like that again (by the way, that scene was also the one that made me think this book would be different than it turned out to be after a few chapters).The second thing that bothered me may sound very technical, and it has to do with show vs. tell. For those who don\u2019t know, a quick explanation: showing means vivid, impactful moments to get the readers invested in the story, for them to remember the important things and connect with the characters and the plot, while telling basically means stating facts, and providing information**. In this book, there\u2019s a telling abuse. Most of the worthwhile content is delivered as facts and historical data, like the battle in Masada. Perhaps it\u2019s just me, that, as a fantasy reader, I\u2019m used to be in the center of the fight and experience everything firsthand, but here, we see the entire battle from Lydia\u2019s point of view, and although the telling isn\u2019t wrong, I can\u2019t feel anything, it\u2019s like watching a very boring movie filled with dialogue in a moment in which I should only be seeing and hearing the clash of swords and shields, the screaming... It\u2019s a siege, for God\u2019s sake! Also, there\u2019s too much telling on the time jumps. In a moment, we are here, and in the next, one or two years have passed. E. g., we get a very intense scene with Lydia in the temple as the battle rages on around her, and in the next page, it\u2019s the same place, only a year later, and the author has skipped all the good stuff, like Herod and Mariamme\u2019s wedding, for example, and I do like a royal wedding in historical fiction from time to time, I mean, imagine the picture that could be painted with the right words! But no, there\u2019s nothing about it.In this story, lots of things happen for no reason, and that\u2019s especially noticeable after Lydia leaves Egypt. The author dedicates five whole chapters to their stay in Rome, and I felt that the whole thing could have been easily removed from the book, and absolutely nothing would have changed. Nothing comes from Lydia serving Octavia, nor from the insinuated attraction between her and Varius, the poet, so why making me read all these chapters to no point? Because there isn\u2019t one, no matter how hard you try to find it. The whole Rome part got me completely lost with so many names and characters, and I ended up bored sick with the political negotiations between Herod and Marc Antony. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s ok to show these things, but there\u2019s a point in which enough is enough, you can\u2019t rely on your readers\u2019 patience forever. The only thing that happens during those chapters that is worth reading is Riva being attacked by the man we later find out had been sent by Salome to find the scrolls. But asides from that, nothing changes in the general plot, I could have just skipped the five chapters, and it would have been exactly the same.If we are talking about pointless scenes, after the Rome part, the one that definitely made me want to flush the book down the nearest toilet was the childbirth scene. So, Mariamme has decided that she wants to escape her husband, so she, Lydia, and Simon get on a cart and secretly leave Jerusalem, but in the nearest inn, Mariamme goes into labor, and then finds out Herod is coming back alive to the city, so she has to go back too. And I was like, \"why on Earth, why??\" Why did I have to read that? The exact same thing could have been told without changing locations, and without exhausting the reader, perhaps saying that Mariamme was about to leave the palace, and then her water broke, and so on. But no. They left, but they had to return anyway, so why making them leave in the first place? Seriously, it made absolutely no difference to the story that she had her baby here, or there. But it did make me angry. What a waste of page time!Can we talk about the \u201cromance\u201d? Because it really disappointed me. As I said before, at first it seemed the love story was going to be between Lydia and Lucius Varius Rufus, the Roman poet, but aside from letting us know that Lydia is attracted to passionate men, it\u2019s just another piece of the novel that could have been cut from the book and nothing would have changed. After him, she meets Simon, who serves Herod as a soldier, and although we see that something grows between them, this book is so boring that even the supposed romance fell flat. They don\u2019t have enough chemistry, there was nothing for me to root for their relationship, and their first kiss just left me with a puzzled expression on my face, over this:\u201cAnd in the kiss something was unleashed within her that had little to do with the way of a man with a woman, and everything to do with the way of an Israelite passionate for her people and her land.\u201d (Chapter 19)Seriously? You kiss the man you are falling in love with, and that\u2019s what you are thinking? If you ask me, I normally would say it\u2019s the other way around. But, see what I mean? For things like this, their moments together are ripped from everything that could be remotely romantic between them. But the last point is the worst. First, Samuel dies before giving further explanations about what he wants Lydia to do, that is finding this Chakkiym people, but it bothered me that he was literally dying, and he kept talking and talking without giving any piece of real, useful information! He didn\u2019t let Lydia interrupt him, but he talked non-stop without getting to the point! Man, you are dying, please say what you mean to say once and for all! *Deep breath* As I said, this book was a huge trial to my patience. After Samuel dies and Lydia leaves Egypt, she spends literally years of her life searching for the Chakkiym, never finding them where she was supposed to, doing what she was told, praying to reach her goal, etc., and we only find out who and where they are in the very last chapter! After that, there\u2019s not even a resolution, because she still doesn\u2019t find them! This seriously pissed me off. After year after year of searching and waiting for Lydia, and painfully boring chapters for me, I don\u2019t even get a resolution? What kind of ending is that?Finally, a quick word on the character building. Lydia is a cardboard character, and I didn\u2019t fully like her. Everyone loves her, she doesn\u2019t have any faults, and everyone who gets to know her can\u2019t help but loving her *eye roll*. No one is like that, as far as I know, and although I was mildly surprised by Lydia\u2019s parentage and royalty, I was too bored to care. At the point in which that\u2019s revealed, I just wanted to be over with the book once and for all. My point is that she, and the rest of the good ones, are very good, nothing is ever their fault and they possess every virtue. That\u2019s their essence, and they don\u2019t feel even remotely human, because no human being is just a big pool of goodness and love. On the other hand, the villains, like Cleopatra, Herod and Salome, are bad, and only bad, they are never humanly vulnerable or show any concern in regards of those around them, their only worries are about their power and the things that could threaten it, and for me, that\u2019s not enough. The worst of them was, definitely, Salome, she\u2019s the witch in every fairytale, she\u2019s nothing more than pure evil. Both her and Herod are not far from the stereotypical villain who creates suffering for no reason, and sometimes it felt like the only thing they had left was to twist a handlebar moustache and tie a woman to the train tracks to fully complete the villainy chart. Phew! That was long, and without covering the details (please don\u2019t make me). I just want to add that this is definitely a no for this author. I tried, and I just couldn\u2019t. If all of her books are like this one, I think I\u2019ll pass.

In the case of The Queen's Handmaid from best-selling author Tracy L. Higley, she writes the little known fictional story of Herod, the Galilean governor with his eye on conquering as many kingdoms as possible. Using all his influence he begins to form alliances with Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt and Mark Anthony, second in command of Rome. Herod hoped that each of these alliances would lead him to gain more control of the surrounding lands he had already acquired and had hoped that with his marriage to Mariamme he would have an heir to his throne. But Herod the Great would soon face his challenges beginning with Cleopatra who would not give up any control to anyone including members of her own family if she felt threatened. She would have them executed without a second thought. Lydia is Cleopatra's handmaid who cares for her children at first until she is introduced to Herod. He sees the intelligence and value she possesses and hires her as a handmaid for his soon-to-be wife. Only Lydia is living with a task she must accomplish in her lifetime and one that requires her to locate a man in the temple courts of Jerusalem and provide him with a set of sealed scrolls from the prophet Daniel. She must not divulge this information to anyone and her mentor Samuel was murdered before he could complete the task. Since he left no sons behind to carry on, he has tasked Lydia with helping to usher in future for the nation of Israel. Only if Samuel was murdered for having the scrolls in his possession, so can Lydia. As things begin to unravel with being in Cleopatra's household, Lydia knows it will only be a matter of time before Cleopatra has her killed as well. Lydia has always proved a threat to Cleopatra not by her words or actions, but by her calm demeanor and how people are immediately drawn to her. Even Cleopatra's own children find solace and comfort in Lydia than with their own mother. So when the opportunity presents itself to flee from Cleopatra and leave secretly with Herod, Lydia realizes that it will not only be for her benefit but also move her closer geographically for finding the one person she can give the scrolls to before they find her. But even Herod has his secret spies working in his own family to ensure their own personal interests and survival, is Lydia any safer with Herod than she is with Cleopatra? I received The Queen's Handmaid by Tracy L. Higley compliments of Litfuse Publicity and Thomas Nelson Publishers for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for my honest review and the opinions contained in this review are strictly my own. I am a huge fan of Tracy Higley's literature because of her ability to write the reader into the story. You are just reading it, you're there as part of the story in the background as a silent observer. You can see and feels things so vividly, pictures aren't required. Her ability to utilize the character of Lydia to bring the characters of Cleopatra and Herod to life in a unique way. Based on factual information, she shows you just how manipulative they each were to obtaining their goals and how they played upon others to achieve their selfish aspirations even at the cost of those they loved. It was sad to see how far greed got carried away in their own life and even though they each thought they were in control, they were really being played by others around them without knowing it. Hands down this one gains a 4.5 out of 5 stars in my opinion and can't wait for more from Tracy in the near future."}, {"userName": "Victor Gentile", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528881-victor-gentile", "userReview": "Tracy L.

Higley was an interesting and passionate novel that explored the lives of Herod and his family as well as the changing times of Israel, Rome, and Egypt. Lydia has the 'privilege' of being the handmaiden to three different high ranking women: Queen Cleopatra of Egypt, the Caesar's wife, and Queen Mariamme of Israel. The plot line is well written and includes elements of tragedy, romance, mystery, and danger. There are few minor changes to the timeline of many of the historical events that happen in this novel, but these only occur in order for the novel to be a reasonable length. I was saddened by many of the true and terrible events that happen by both Cleopatra's hands and Herod's. Mariamme had a very unfortunate life under Herod's rule, and this book definitely made me more aware of this. Lydia also had her own struggles, but I enjoyed watching her work through those situations, begin to trust and to follow God, and as she tried to save those she was with and whom she loved. I also really liked the man who entered her life as well as their relationship and how each was drawn into a stronger relationship with the Lord. Overall, I found The Queen's Handmaid to be an excellent historical novel that drew me in and gave me a better understanding of life in Israel during Herod's reign.

Honestly, I enjoyed City on Fire a bit better than this book. I don\u2019t think I was truly able to get into it until about the last third to quarter of the book when the plot really picked up. It took place over quite a long period of time\u2014several years. I think this may have somewhat distanced me from the characters since such large chunks of time were skipped. And it felt as though it lacked the action was I was hoping for.All that said, it was still a fascinating read. I have not read much about this particular time period. It brings in many historical figures\u2014Cleopatra, Herod, and Marc Antony just to name a few\u2014and they are very prevalent characters in the story. Many of them even have POV scenes. That alone is fascinating. And I love how she tied the story in with the magi at Jesus\u2019s birth.Though it felt (to me) as if it dragged a bit, and I had a little trouble warming up to the characters, I very much recommend the book, if only for the amazing history involved in it. If you\u2019re looking for fiction that really gets into the details and way of life of the time period, Tracy Higley is the one to go to. She does an amazing job of setting the scene and making you feel like you\u2019re really there without going overboard on boring description. It was definitely worth my time to read.

I will definitely be speaking of this book to others and keeping it on my self for a long time to come, someday to share with a daughter I might have, to teach her Biblical history in a delightful way, as I have learned more of from this emotionally wrapping book. (Oh yes- I cannot end this review without saying that I cried more in this book than I have in any book for more than two years.

As soon as I read the first chapter, I could not put the book down. The action packed, fast paced story and historical characters had me glued to my Kindle for hours. Although it was a little confusing to keep up with all the names and characters in the beginning, I was able to keep up with it and was very excited (I looove history), and it added another spark to the story. The main character, Lydia, was a lovely character that I could easily sympathize with, and although we never reaaalllyyy get to know much of other characters, the story was wonderful. I loved how she kept going back to her thoughts on God, and loved how His power was clearly shown throughout the book. I especially enjoyed the romance that seemed to follow the character around, which really added more excitement to the story. I will say that what kept me from 5 stars was that the story moved too fast at times, and the ending was ANYTHING BUT SATISFYING.

Have you ever really stopped to think about that for a moment? Have you stopped to think that Cleopatra, Mark Antony and Herod the Great were all leaders at the same time? I guess I just didn\u2019t think. I appreciate that Higley researches things so well and brings history alive to me. Her stories help me understand the political and religious situations of ancient history.

Mariamme is to marry Herod and he has procured Lydia to be her handmaid. It may be Herod who takes her into the Holy City, but, it is the dying requests of her mentor that makes Lydia question what she is doing in the city. She has been charged with delivering the scrolls of the prophet Daniel, to the temple on a set day of the year. Why are these scrolls so important and could there really be just one God for all men?It had been Simon\u2019s wish for Lydia to know the One God of Israel but Lydia is confused about what she should believe. It doesn\u2019t help that the dark arts of Herod\u2019s sister, Salome are influencing the people of the palace. Lydia\u2019s life is in danger and the scrolls are at a risk of being found.As Lydia tries to serve Mariamme as faithfully as she can, the cruelty and malice of the political leaders of the day are becoming more apparent. Secrets whispered about a promised Messiah have stirred fear and unrest among the nobles. As the story progresses, the instability and hatred that Herod is capable of becomes more apparent and at the pinnacle of his madness, Lydia must make a decision to either embrace darkness or find her faith and salvation. This story is so intricately woven into actual historical facts. Some were fascinating, others were scary and some were downright heartbreaking. The life of Herod and the genealogical details of that family are so confusing that I had to refer to the family tree on more than one occasion. The author so graciously provided the family tree in the front of the book for easy reference. If you\u2019re looking to better understand the time in which Christ was born and the political unrest that plagued His world, this is a fantastic book. I was enthralled from the first glance of the cover and the story inside did not disappoint.

Filled to brim with accurate historic events and a nice amount of fiction, this memorable story is sure to stay with you long after you close it's pages.This was the second book that I've read by Tracy Higley. Last year when I read her novel City on Fire, I deemed her my favorite author for her excellent writing and ability to involve so much history within her novels; and was very eager for more books by her. Which is why I was so excited for the release of The Queen's Handmaid!This book was such a favorite, I'm putting it on my list of top favorite five books that I've read in 2014! The main thing that impressed me most was the amount of history in this book! I truly believe that you could learn more about Egyptian history involving who reigned at what time and their relationship with other people of government, by reading this novel than you could reading about it on the internet! In the course of the 400 pages of this novel there are detailed, historically accurate accounts of important governmental figures in Egypt such as Cleopatra, Herod, Marc Antony, Octavia, Mariamme (Herod's wife and the Queen whom Lydia serves) and many more! While this level of history may make some people think that it means that it lacks a good fictionalized portion of the book (stemming from a pre-supposed idea that history is boring facts-which it's not!), then there couldn't be anything further from the truth! While this book was mainly based on history, there was also a perfect balance of fictionalized story that didn't diminish the history; but in fact made it more enjoyable to read and all the more interesting! Anyone who, like me, loves a novel that will teach you something about history without sacrificing a page-turning experience needs to get their hands on this book!Another thing that I really enjoyed about this novel was how interesting it was, and the unexpected turns that I didn't see coming! While it was interesting throughout the whole story, I did feel like the second half of the book was my most favorite portion of the story. Originally I was planning on giving it four stars while I was reading the first half of the book. But events that took place during the latter part of the story made me change my mind to 5 stars, also putting it on my favorites list.However, as with any historically accurate portrayal of real events in history that may not have been so appropriate, this story does deal with some mature subjects including mention of Cleopatra and Herod's love life which was never faithful and continually changing persons; a moderately described birth scene that Lydia assisted; three deaths scenes, one by hanging which was described moderately (though still somewhat disturbing), as well as two others described after the actual event; as well as other content that comes with this time period where murder is considered justified by means of gaining power. While I usually don't like putting an age on these types of novels, due to how it really does vary depending on maturity, I'd say it is for sure a novel for mature readers, and that younger readers should read with caution.Overall I absolutely loved this novel and all the history it taught me! Anyone who is a fan of Higley's previous novels or fans of heavy dosed historical fiction should read this book!D I S C L A I M E R :: I received a free copy of this book through the publisher and Litfuse Publicity for the sole purpose of this review.

Higley I have had the pleasure of reading and WOW. I am a big fan of Biblical Fiction so when I saw this book I knew I had to read it. Lydia is an orphan and has been raised as a servant in Cleopatra's palace. Lydia has no family she knows of but has found a family in a few people in the palace including Samuel, Lydia's mentor and teacher and Banafrit, Cleopatra's personal cook. Lydia has been doing pottery in secret to sell to try to get out of the palace and on her own. Lydia finds Samuel after her duties and finds him injured. With his dying breaths you tasks Lydia with delivery secret writings of the prophet Daniel to those watching for the Messiah. He also gives her a pendant that was her mother's, saying he and Banafrit knew her mother. Lydia finds herself being taken from Cleopatra's palace to Jerusalem to serve as Herod the Great's new wife's handmaid. Lydia finds herself in the middle of a mess as she attends to Queen Mariamme but finds out much of what is needed for her task. I really loved this book! As I stated, I haven't read anything by Tracy L. Higley until this book but I had a few of her books on my TBR pile. I had read many glowing reviews so I knew I wanted to read her books. Tracy L. Higley writes with authority on biblical history, the geography of biblical times, and the politics during that time. I could not put this book down, it kept me engaged from the start right until the end. I thought the characters were fantastic and Tracy L. Higley gives these characters such life and depth. I found myself drawn to the character of Queen Mariamme. She is a kind woman who loved God, her family, and would do anything to protect them. As I read this book I felt like I was there watching the events unfold right in front of me. I learned a lot about this time in history that I did not know before. I was fascinated with all the facts in this book. Tracy L. Higley did a wonderful job weaving fact and fiction together into a cohesive work of fiction. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoy Biblical Fiction, Tracy L. Higley is a must read author in the genre. I cannot wait to start reading her other books that are in my TBR pile! I give this book 5 STARS."}, {"userName": "Barbara Shelton", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3884282-barbara-shelton", "userReview": "This story is a stunner!

Her artistic pottery is in demand and already she has collected a bag of coins against the day she can escape from the palace and start her own business. But the night Herod comes to visit, everything changes. Cleopatra, stymied in her attempt to seduce Herod, takes out her anger on those around her. After doing away with loose-lipped Andromeda, Lydia is in her sites.Lydia, meanwhile, responds to an urgent call from her elderly Jewish friend Samuel. Determined to hear what he has to tell her, she goes to his home only to find it a shambles and the old man beaten and all but dead. With his last breath he entrusts her with an ancient parchment to deliver to Jerusalem and gives her a unique necklace. \u201cIt was your mother\u2019s,\u201d he manages to gasp\u2014and he\u2019s gone. What\u2019s she to do? Suddenly Herod\u2019s earlier offer to take her with him from Alexandria to become a maid to his betrothed Mariamme seems like a good idea. And so the next day finds her on a boat fleeing murderous Cleopatra while on a secret and dangerous mission of her own.We follow Lydia for the next few years as she travels from Egypt to Rome, on to Masada and finally Jerusalem in Tracy Higley\u2019s historical fiction The Queen\u2019s Handmaid. Lydia always manages to find work at the highest levels and so we get close-up glimpses of the political life and the power characters during the time period just before Christ. The characters, real and fictional, are rendered vividly and with confidence. In a note at the end of the book Higley tells us what she was hoping to achieve. She invented Lydia as a fictional \u201cwitness\u201d character through whom we would see some of the major political players of the day: Cleopatra, Caesar Augustus, Marc Antony, Herod, his sister Salome and wife Mariamme. As well, Higley\u2019s own travels to Alexandria, Rome, Jerusalem and Masada lend accuracy and detail to descriptions of the setting.The plot kept me engrossed and reading at a good pace. The intrigue in each palace made for great human interest and the author\u2019s familiarity with the various locations gave me confidence that I was in good hands. Lydia, the orphan, is a sympathetic character in her search for identity and worth. Her romantic interest in Herod\u2019s administrator Simon added another magnet to the plot. If there was one thing that seemed little unbelievable, it was how Lydia always managed to be working for one of the land\u2019s leading ladies (Cleopatra, Octavia, Mariamme). But that aside, The Queen\u2019s Handmaid is a well-plotted, well-written historical fiction that I\u2019m sure lovers of historical and biblical fiction will enjoy.

Higley started her first novel at age eight and has been hooked on writing ever since. She has authored nine novels, including Garden of Madness and So Shines the Night. Tracy is currently pursuing a graduate degree in Ancient History and has traveled through Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Italy, researching her novels and falling into adventures. See her travel journals and more at TracyHigley.com.My Review:Lydia's life has consisted of her taking care of Cleopatra's dear child. Lydia never knew her own parents, but learned a lot from the many people around her. But when King Herod arrives to speak with Cleopatra, the whole palace is changed. People scurried about tiding up different things, making sure the Cleopatra came across as a well reserved woman. A good friend of Lydia's arrived that day telling her that she must heed is warning and listen to what he has to say, but she was much to busy to sit down for a moment and listen. Her named called and off she was again running to aid the child she has come to love. Pondering on what her friend has said she is soon called to Cleopatra's side to show off what a beaut of a son she has. But King Herod see's something in Lydia, something that could be useful to him.Cleopatra knows she can have whatever she wants, by a mere snap of her fingers. But she never expected the Herod would be of interest in her sons nurse. But what is one servant missing going to do to her? She is all and powerful, but yet his interest in her drives Cleopatra wild. In her eyes, this servant girl must go, by death. When she comes up missing, Cleopatra sends her guards out to find her and finish her off, but it seems Lydia has other ideas.**Disclosure** This book was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from Litfuse Publicity."}, {"userName": "Gretchen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8469197-gretchen", "userReview": "A book has to be pretty abysmal for me to give it one star. This book is close. I'm giving it one and a half stars which might be generous.First off, if I had known this book fell under the category, Christian historical fiction, I would have never accepted early copy. Christian historical fiction just isn't in my normal wheelhouse. My biggest problems with this book were NOT with the Christian content. I would like to make that clear before moving on with the review. I had no problems with Christian tone of the book. Side note- The book falls under the category Christian historical fiction but considering the protagonist of the book is Jewish and the main plots deal with the plight of the Jewish people, isn't the Christian label wrong? I don't want to start a fight about religion or politics, I'm just curious. Perhaps a greater understanding of the Roman Empire and the Middle East at this particular point in history would help me just a little bit. There were SO many different people mentioned in this book. Herod had his family and army of men. Marc Antony had his army of men. Cleopatra had her family and army or men. Mariamme had her family and army of men. There were Romans. There were Jews. There were different tribes of Jews. I had no clue who was who. Names were just constantly thrown out and you better be paying attention to the context clues if you wanted to know who was who. A cast of characters list would be a welcome addition to this book. I couldn't justify the waste of paper it would have taken to write down everyone's name and role throughout the book. Another thing that really drove me batty was the constant time jumping. Read a paragraph and suddenly at the end of the next paragraph you have moved ahead in time a year or two. Dates would have been helpful. Between the people and the time, I had to spend a lot of time focused on things outside the main plot. At the end it just got too confusing and really ruined the story for me. A minor issue I had was with the ebook formatting. I am not going to make too much of a big deal out of this as I understand this is an arc, not a final copy. I still feel the need to point these things out in the hopes someone sees this and fixes them. I was reading this book on my Kindle. Pages were cut off in funny places. Paragraphs split wrong. Spacing was terrible and the first letter of every word in every chapter was missing. Again, I realize this was an arc but I am hoping the right people read this so it might be fixed. My final issue with the this book was the constantly changing point of views. You might start a page working from Lydia's point of view only to end it working from Simon's point of view after you worked through Mariamme's point of views. Does that make sense? If it didn't, good. That's exactly how I felt for a large portion of this book.

Higley books, I wasn't sure how I felt about the book, with the first few chapters.Definitely well researched, although \"The Queen's Handmaid\" is set with a fictional character of Lydia, Tracy displayed a thorough knowledge of the pre-history of Cleopatra, Marc Antony and Herod to establish a powerful setting for what becomes a story about not just self-discovery but the anticipation of a Messiah.This is not light reading and for \"sensitive\" readers, be prepared for very deep scenes that, although are not graphic, even the innuendos that captures the cultural tones and mores of the times, maybe upsetting for some while for others, they will understand that it was part of the cultural and viewpoints of the people of that time period.The detailing is definitely rich and Tracy really captures not just Egypt, but Rome, Jerusalem and the beliefs and cultures that were prevalent in Ancient Times. At the same time, readers need to be prepared to dedicated time to reading this book thoroughly lest they will miss out in the rich characters and settings, that Tracy really proves herself with in, \"The Queen's Handmaid\" that by the time I had finished the book, I was completely impressed with her handling of not just delicate subject matter, but in really capturing the political intrigue, the mythology that surrounded Cleopatra and although definitely fictionalized, a \"what if\" look into Herod's madness.The time and setting is well before the birth of Christ and doesn't focus on Christ but rather on the underlying prayers and hopes of an oppressed people, praying for a Messiah to release them from the conflicting worlds that they find themselves, nothing but pawns.Tracy provides an archaeological look at not just how the upper class lived, but the background scenes of the servants who served them, often with little say in their destiny that seem to be at the whims of their Mistresses and Masters.A well written and powerful story, I actually appreciated, finishing the book, the ambiguity and hesitation that started off the book.....Looking back, the few chapters may seem slow or puzzling but what Tracy does is really help build up to a powerful story that by the time I and the reader are done with the book, one will find themselves complete caught up in a world long gone by now.This is not a book to be read quickly, but rather you want to be able to take the time to slowly read through the book, savor the rich details and reflect on the questions that Tracy provides at the end, making this a definitely must read, particularly for those who are part of a book club."}, {"userName": "Beckie Burnham", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2952739-beckie-burnham", "userReview": "Tracy L. Higley consistently writes well-research historical novels with a fictional thread that not only fits the context, but adds depth and meaning. In The Queen\u2019s Handmaid, Higley tackles the story of the Herodian, Hasmonean and Ptolemaic dynasties during the expansion of the Roman Empire. Sound daunting? Well think about the importance of this time in history \u2014 three decades before the birth of Christ. This was a time I new little about, but The Queen\u2019s Handmaid put the political and spiritual implications in perspective for me. A great read for fans of Biblical history.Lydia is the nursemaid for Cleopatra\u2019s son Caesarion. An orphan with no idea of her family origins, she finds family in those she serves and serves with. But she has often found that relationships end and often painfully. So she keeps her distance while drawing people to herself at the same time. Through her studies with Samuel, Lydia is placed in a position to serve the Jewish One God, and this places her on a spiritual journey from Egypt through Rome to Judea, as she serves as the handmaid for wives of influential leaders of the time.The reigns of the Ptolemys and the Herodians are filled with cruelty, murder and incest (at least in modern terms). They married uncles, nieces and cousins and had no compunction in killing anyone on their way to power, including wives, brothers and children. They also repeated the same names, even within the same generation, causing some identification problem for this reader. Higley does include genealogies to help with this. And while there are huge power struggles \u2014 Greek Ptolemys ruling Egypt and Idumean Herodians conquering Judea \u2014 it is the portrayal of the Jewish spirit of independence and the anticipation of the Messiah that brings this novel a depth perhaps not seen in the historical record. Lydia\u2019s character, while fictional, is realistic. Her quiet strength, faithfulness and determination draw others to her, while also garnering her very formidable enemies. Her struggle to find identity, which leads her to the One God, is one we all face. The quest entrusted to her by her mentor, Samuel, doesn\u2019t end with the last page of the novel, and I am looking forward to seeing just where her story will take us. Hopefully her next stop will be among the Wise Men of the East.Not a quick read \u2014 there is just too much history and political intrigue to digest \u2014 it is, nevertheless, a page turner. I recommend The Queen\u2019s Handmaid to those who want to know more about the time leading up to Jesus\u2019s birth. The words, In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus (Luke 2:1), just might take on a new meaning.Recommended.(Thanks to Thomas Nelson and LitFuse for my review copy.

In \"The Queen's Handmaid,\" we travel back to the time in between the Old and New Testaments, into the palaces of Egypt, Rome, and Judea, where one servant girl guards precious scrolls written by the prophet Daniel many years ago in Babylon.Raised as a servant in Cleopatra's home, Lydia is a responsible and skilled young lady. A fellow servant, a Hebrew named Samuel, has instilled in Lydia a respect for the One True God. As Samuel is dying, he entrusts Lydia with the care of the sacred scrolls which his family has kept hidden for many generations. He instructs Lydia that when she is able, she is to take the scrolls to the Temple on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, to meet a man wearing a specific prayer shawl. On that one day a year a stranger will be waiting and watching for her. At the time of Samuel's death, a young and ambitious Herod is visiting Cleopatra and looking to form an alliance in order to be supported in his quest to take the throne in Judea. Lydia captures his eye, and he takes her to be a maid for his fiancee. The One God is leading her towards her mission objective!Lydia is excited to see a new land and serve a new mistress. Her personality tends to draw everyone to her so that they find her indispensable, but she's guarded in letting people in. While making a few friends along the way, she also catches the eye of Herod's evil sister, who is interested in foreign gods and their dark power. Danger lurks in more than one way, as the political situation is ever shifting, and there are those who are hunting the scrolls for their own purposes.There are two handy family trees at the beginning of this book to help us keep track of the history of leadership in Jerusalem. With so many men and women who shared similar names, I referenced the family tree often to help me keep things straight. Herod's page also extends many years past the end of our story, to document his descendants who were mentioned in the New Testament.This story was very captivating, and I had a hard time putting it down. I wanted to see Lydia safely through her quest, and I cared about what happened to her. Her life was more than it seemed, and even as the secrets of her past unfolded, I feared they would take her away from being able to fulfill her calling and find happiness. I can't tell you how the story unfolded, but I can urge you to check it out if you enjoy historical fiction!I received my copy of the book from LitFuse Publicity in exchange for my honest review.

Higley's books for awhile now. So when her newest book, \nThe Queen's Handmaid\n, came up for review I didn't hesitate to request it. I wasn't disappointed.The year is 39 BC when we meet Lydia. Cleopatra is the current Queen ruling over Egypt while Lydia is nurse to her son, Caesarion. Lydia is a beautiful, and unpretentious, young woman who knows nothing of her family or life outside the palace walls. Her heart belongs to Caesarion and her friend, Samuel.Samuel, a Jewish man, has done his best to teach Lydia about his God and his heritage. He didn't have any children of his own, so he taught everything that he could to Lydia. When Herod arrives to visit the queen, things become complicated. Deciding that Lydia would be better suited to serve his future wife, Herod chose to take Lydia to Jerusalem with him.Wanting to say goodbye to Samuel, Lydia discovers that he had been attacked and is close to death. Using the last of his strength, Samuel tells Lydia about the scrolls that he has been hiding; and instructs her to carefully hide and guard them until she could get them to the Chakkiym. They\u2019ve cost Samuel his life and now Lydia is charged with smuggling them out of Egypt in order to get them into the proper hands in Jerusalem.Lydia made the decision to accept Herod's offer because it was the perfect opportunity for her to get the scrolls out of Egypt. Arriving in Jerusalem wasn't an easy task, especially with the scrolls, which she wasn't even sure what was written in them. Uncertain of what exactly these scrolls held, Lydia knows her life is in danger. Not only that but she\u2019ll be living in Herod's home where she'll have to deal with jealous servants, political tensions, fickle diplomats, as well as her own emotions. All she\u2019s ever wanted was a place to belong... a family. Tracy's storytelling is fantastic! She pulled me into Lydia's world, where I met people I fell in love with. People like Queen Mariamme, Simon, and, of course, Lydia. I also enjoyed her descriptions of the different scenes, from Egypt to Jerusalem to the palace interior, she made me feel like I was there standing beside Lydia with each turn of the page. Last but not least I liked how impeccably Tracy brought history to life, and that she included \"The Story Behind the Story...and Beyond\", where she separated fact from fiction; it was well worth reading.**\nThe Queen's Handmaid\n by Tracy L.

She is an orphan and has been raised in the palace. She has an artistic flair for fabric and clothing designs as well as pottery. She takes care of Cleopatra\u2019s young son by Julius Caesar. Herod comes to visit Cleopatra and takes a liking to Lydia. He thinks she will be a help to his betrothed, Mariamme, who is in Israel. While in Egypt, Lydia has been mentored by an old Jewish man, Samuel, in the ways of the One True God. Before being forced to leave Egypt, Lydia is entrusted with a precious cargo and is given a mission by Samuel. Evil is waiting for Samuel and will follow Lydia as Samuel had warned her it would.Herod eventually gains the throne in Jerusalem with the help of Marc Antony and Rome. He marries Mariamme and installs his evil mother and sister in the palace as well. His sister is Salome. She worships an evil god and has great influence over her brother. She also dislikes Lydia. Lydia still tries to fulfill her mission that Samuel gave her, but doesn\u2019t find what she is looking for. She vows to keep trying no matter how long it takes. Lydia becomes great friends with Mariamme. Lydia also catches the eye of Simon, a Jew in charge of Herod\u2019s palace. She and Simon grow close and just when he declares his feelings for her, a new discovery is made. Tracy Higley is in fine form in this fantastic novel! I couldn\u2019t put it down. There was plenty of palace/royal intrigue, drama, excitement as well as some tragic and heartbreaking moments. There was a romance for the main character of Lydia. The theme of gaining your identity through being a child of God, not by who your parents are or what your job is or what people think of you ran throughout the book. Lydia at first is a young, timid maid, but matures into a confident princess of the King, standing up to fight evil. It was wonderful to see her transformation. Lydia endured a lot of tragedy in her young life, but never succumbed to self-pity. This story had a great plot and lots of action too. I can\u2019t wait to see what this author offers up next!My rating is 5 stars.Note: I received a complimentary copy for an honest review of this book.

I had never read anything by this author, and I don't remember hearing much about her, but it turns out that Tracy L. Higley is a force to be reckoned with! This book was marvelous! I don't believe that I have ever read a fictional book that included so much history. The amount of research that had to go into the making of this story is astonishing, because it appears the author really knew her stuff. This novel is about Queen Cleopatra's maid, Lydia. Lydia serves as a personal maid for two or three different queens before the facts about her heritage and calling came to light. Though this is a completely fictional book, it is based off of real people in Egyptian history. I don't know a whole lot about the Egyptian culture or their history, but I did of course recognize a few key names, such as Julius Caesar, King Herod and Cleopatra. It was nice to get a little insight as to what Egyptian life was like in those times, and how kingdom's were ruled. I know that a lot of ancient kings (and some not so ancient rulers) govern by cruelty and force, but the way the author described some of the horrors created by these morally polluted politicians made me shiver. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't gory, just eye opening. The thought of having to watch the deaths of your friends and family with indifference upon your face is terrifying. I loved how the characters progressed with the story. Certain ones grew weak, and others strong as the plot progressed. Oh, did I mention that it is a total page turner? I simply couldn't put it down! The suspense was killing me! This is one of those books that you choose over sleep. I also liked how well written it was. The author has a writing style that will keep your eyes glued to the page. She is descriptive (not to the point of boredom, but enough to give you a clear vision of what is happening), she is passionate, and she is very well rounded. I would encourage anyone with a love of historical fiction or Christian fiction alike to read this book. I certainly am glad that I did.~The Literary MaidensNote: I was provided with a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion by the Litfuse Publicity Group.
