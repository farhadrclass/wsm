Edward and Florence have gone to a lovely seaside hotel on their wedding night, totally unprepared for the actual mechanics of sex. Both are virgins. Both have little knowledge of what can or should be done and the result is not a happy one. Still, the issue here is not about the mores of the 50\u2019s, I believe. Is it really possible for two 20-somethings to be so ignorant, even in 1962? I suppose it is possible. But this is a novel about communication and trust more than about the uptight mores of a bygone time. Ian McEwan - from his websiteWe are shown the history of their relationship via flashback. Florence came from a home bereft of physical contact. There is one scene in which it is intimated, although not conclusively, that her father may have been guilty of a crime against her youth. No wonder she is frightened. Physicality to her is a source of shame. And once given (as when she was cuddled by one of her nannies as a child) the pleasure is soon yanked away. (The nanny was let go) But the crime here is that Edward and Florence are unable to talk with each other about their problem. Had they exercised the power of speech they might have found a way out of their marital jungle. We are shown what the future holds for them. And maybe in that is a message about disparate times. Maybe, even with all the angst of changes over the last 50 years, we are in a better position to address our issues in the 21st century, even despite the divorce rate.

Don\u2019t believe me? What if I told you that the book \u2013 which is 200 pages long \u2013 only covers about two hours of time: the first two hours of a newlywed couple\u2019s honeymoon in which they fumble to consummate their marriage? And that both of them have very embarrassing sexual dysfunctions? Well, that\u2019s what the book is about. The reader looks on helplessly and squirmingly as two virgins, Edward and Florence, sit in a hotel room on the beach embarrassed out of their minds. It\u2019s 1962, on the cusp of the sexual revolution, and the pair have neither the presence of mind or even the vocabulary to communicate openly with each other. There is only a handful of words spoken until the very last chapter of the book (it was tough for me not to use the word climax here, but I try to stay classy). For the first 50 pages or so I was convinced that McEwan was just selling a freak show to us (again) \u2013 that he\u2019s a popular author because people like reading about sex and other people\u2019s weirdo sex problems. Who needs a plot or well-executed sentences when we could have incest, brain damage, erectile dysfunction, and a 30,000 word sex scene? Bring on other peoples\u2019 guilt and shame! But I kept reading and I\u2019m glad I did. Through a number of seamless flashbacks, the history of the couple unfolded before me \u2013 so slowly and steadily and adeptly that I am now convinced that Ian McEwan is a genius. A dirty old man genius. It made me think back to a few years ago when Ben and I were lucky enough to interview Jim Shepard, Ben\u2019s favorite contemporary writer and a visiting author at the University of Montana (visiting because Ben requested him, no less). We sat in the Union Club sipping straight whiskeys and Jim Shepard told us that the truly great books (he was specifically talking about Marilynne Robinson\u2019s Housekeeping) are books that are constantly revelatory. And that\u2019s exactly what I though about On Chesil Beach. Everyone \u2013 we\u2019re talking about the characters and me \u2013 were learning and understanding more and more deeply with each page. It felt like a blossoming or, to be less lame and corny, like a picture very slowly coming into focus. Many times when authors reveal information it seems cheap or as if they were withholding it from you in order to keep you reading \u2013 dime mystery book stuff. But McEwan\u2019s real gift is in the natural and subtle ways that he presents information to the reader. In fact, many of the biggest revelations in the book are never said outright, but only seep into the story until you understand each one as truth. It\u2019s really pretty well done. So \u2013 if you can handle cringing non-stop for three or four hours and have a strong stomach, you should pick up this book. And let me know if you can figure out exactly how McEwan does what he does, because I\u2019d like to know about it."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "[have three children, starting very soon after the annulment of her marriage to Edward, totally changes the causes and consequences of what went wrong on their wedding night (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jim Fonseca", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca", "userReview": "We know the story in advance from the book jacket: a disastrous wedding night.

Newly married couple. Wedding Night. Virgins. Afraid of sexual failure = our storyline. Much can be said about Florence's total lack of interest in sex, her fear of intimacy, her disgust at being touched. Okay, we know she was a 'product of her time' - a time just before the cultural change that revolutionized romance and sex in the West; - we know social conditioning had led her to view sex as dirty and corrupting, and we know there had not existed an acceptable common language to discuss those matters; and we know that she was kind of introvert with a singular aim of making it big in the world of classical music. Some of those possibilities are explored briefly, some only alluded to, but none of those make her problem convincing I hoped in vain to learn something startling at the end, something Zweig-like. But there was nothing.Was she frigid or asexual, a claim Edward, her one-night husband, hurls at her as an accusation? Was there some other psychological reason from her past that changed her attitude towards copulation? Perhaps. She says at one point, Perhaps what I really need to to d0 is kill my mother and marry my father. - she did not seem to have an emotional attachment with either of her parent, not in the normal sense. Or was she a 'queer' and did not know about her own sexuality? I admit this last one felt like the most plausible reason. But perhaps none of it matters to the story. It is not about sex but the failure of romance, about lack of faith in one's own abilities, about missed opportunities, about the passing of time, about doing nothing. How an entire course of a life can be changed--by doing nothing.The novel works as a basic portrait of the 1960s England with focus on London, Oxford and its vicinity, its cultural and political scene, and two young people from different classes growing up apart and coming together in an uneven relationship that ends in a horrible crash on the Chesil Beach. And that was that. Also, it gets rather treacly in the end, to make us feel sorry for the couple, enlarging on their romance post-breakup, summing up their whole lives after going separate ways in two or three pages that should not have been inflicted on the reader.December '16"}, {"userName": "Jason Pettus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus", "userReview": "(The much longer full review can be found at the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com].)Regular readers know that this month CCLaP is taking an extended look at the nominees for the 2007 Booker Prize; and regular readers also know that so far I've been mostly disappointed by the nominees I've read, finding most of them to be inconsequential little wisps of stories, many of them well-written but certainly not weighty enough to be called \"The Best Novel of 2007.\" And thus do we come to the fifth Booker nominee to be reviewed here, as well as the one easily most well-known, Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach; and let me tell you, if a common complaint about this year's Booker nominees is of their slight and inconsequential nature, On Chesil Beach isn't helping matters at all, in that it is such a non-excuse for a novel as to almost not exist. In fact, I can literally give you the entire plot of this 200-page, paperback-sized book in literally 177 words; and this is a major spoiler alert, by the way, because I'm not kidding, I really am about to tell you the entire storyline of On Chesil Beach from beginning to end, without skipping a single detail, in 177 words. Ready?A young middle-class couple get married in England in 1962, and spend their wedding night on Chesil Beach. He only got married because he's horny as hell and lives in middle-class 1962 England, where getting married is the only chance you're going to have to get laid, and as a result has now become a cuckold employee of his upper-class father-in-law; she despises the very idea of sex altogether, but is too much of a coward to tell her husband, instead spending months psyching herself up into performing her upcoming \"wifely duties.\" The wedding night arrives. He gets so excited that he has a premature ejaculation on his wife's stomach. She becomes so disgusted that she flees the room in a panic. He chases her down the beach, where they have an explosive argument based on mutual misunderstanding of each other's behavior. She leaves him that night and their marriage is annulled (presumably). And he spends the rest of his life thinking about \"the relationship that was never meant to be.\"No, dude, seriously, that's it; that's the entire freaking plotline of the book. Which, fine, I don't necessarily mind when it's a 10,000-word short story in a literary magazine, that I'm reading on a boring Sunday afternoon down at my neighborhood cafe; but seriously, as a standalone book for 22 damn dollars?

It's under 200 pages, and the story seems simple: the 1962 wedding night of Edward and Florence, two young, virginal people in love. Edward is ready to burst with the desire to consummate their marriage; Florence is dreading it.But it isn't so simple. The night is a disaster, and wrought with the secret scars and fatal flaws the two people carry around. The writing is so revealing of the complexities each person brings with them to a relationship. The crux lies in what is not done, what is unsaid, and then, painfully, what is unlived. Nothing matters except what could have been. Inconceivably, it is easier to live a whole entire life unfulfilled rather than utter one's truth or javelin over the barrier of pride. A whole life.

On Chesil Beach is a simple love story about two opposing souls - but it is no love story in a typical way. In this short book, Ian McEwan reverses the love story and tells it backwards from their wedding night, allowing those events described to find a climax which might take them into a future with each other or separate them forever.In the beginning, Edward and Florence prepare each other for their wedding night. It is the year 1962; a time when talking about sexuality was not as easy and natural as it would be fifty years later. Both Edward and Florence are virgins; however, Florence believes Edward to be experienced with other women, and Edward doesn't know about Florence's anxiety to even think of sexual relationships, of the disgusting feeling which builds in her stomach whenever her thoughts wander off to this night she fears so much. It is a simple premise, a fact which keeps this book from becoming as interesting and masterful as the complex Atonement, yet a premise intriguing enough for me to become interested in the characters. And interesting and complex they were indeed.Ian McEwan's prose is beautiful as ever in this novella. He belongs to those writers you only have to read a few sentences from and immediately know they have been written by him. There is something powerful behind the words he chooses, something that makes you care for the characters even if it is sometimes difficult to understand their motivations. This simple story is able to say so much about human nature: how it is mandatory to talk to each other honestly about one's fears and feelings, because remaining silent could almost never lead into a happy future.Over the course of 200 pages, Ian McEwan spends one fateful evening with his two main characters and their wedding night, yet the only time this book feels boring is when pages and pages of background information are inserted, something which would not have been necessary, considering the precision the characters have already been developed with. But who if not Ian McEwan could have been able to talk about a wedding night for 200 pages and never make it appear senseless or as if he went rambling?Overall, my third McEwan novel proved to be a surprisingly interesting and insightful read, though while a lot better than The Innocent, not as complex and stunning as Atonement. Recommended for everyone interested in a convincing, yet not perfect love story written by a male author, although it may not be the best novel to start with if you want to get into McEwan's writing."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Having only previously read Atonement & Saturday, I was both incredibly reluctant and eager to know what the \u201cliterary device\u201d used in On Chesil Beach was; a.k.a., why it almost won the Booker Prize. I must say that the prose is so simple as to be deceitful and I was instantly aware, as I reached its final pages, that this novel was NO Atonement. (Indeed this is the stark opposite of that new classic: it is small where Atonement is enormous and epic, simple while Atonement is complex, and Atonement is a love story while On Chesil Beach is about the absence of that particular element and the end of romance.) But there is also no reason to believe that, while taking on that same theme of crystallization of a particular moment in a human\u2019s life, On Chesil Beach is the trash that Saturday is. That heinous novel, about a pompous neurosurgeon who believes he has literary entitlement just because he can \u201cpredict events\u201d in his neobourgeois life, simply by knowing how the human body works, and dissecting daily minutiae into scientific (therefore, deeply unpoetic) reasoning, playing \u201cGod\u201d--I found it incredibly irritating. Stupid. Especially having had read Atonement and thinking that a writer like McEwan would never dare disappoint the Reader. But after the popularity of the book I keep mentioning, and will continue to mention for time to come (with a strange type of fanboy fervor)-- Atonement-- I guess the author felt it comfortable to come up with simpler stories, perhaps even complete foils of the book that put McEwan at the forefront.The play with time is what McEwan is all about, more than being a romantic, more than being a mod Londoner. And On Chesil Beach succeeds admirably in that aspect. Sure, I could care less about Florence and Edward, their being \u201cvictims of their time\u201d seems at once cliched, even somewhat intolerable. Why should we care about characters that really don\u2019t even know themselves? I find Briony Tallis\u2019s lie much more compelling than this: \u201chow an entire course of a life can be changed--by doing nothing.\u201d (203) This theme of doing nothing, or of active non-action, is a paradigm of most English classics, even modern ones like Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s awesome Never Let Me Go."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"...being in love was not a steady state, but a matter of fresh surges or waves, and he was experiencing one now.\"-- Ian McEwan, On Chesil BeachAlmost no one can write about sex well in my opinion. You've got your erotic writers, fine, if your need for arousal and release comes from text rather than pictures or actual lovers. There are certainly millions of toss-n-tug novels that can certainly get things done. But these books, obviously, aren't literature. There are writers, like Ken Follett, who seem to need to insert sex writing into a novel every 160 - 200 pages just to help drive the novel's narrative forward. Sex in these adventure, mystery, genre novels, etc., acts as almost a sign post or quick reward. \"Congrats, fair reader, you made it to page 320, here is your second sex scene on a road with a monk.\" But as delivered, it all just seems a bit flat and not a little absurd. Now, I'm not saying there isn't good sex writing out there, I have actually come across some. Joyce, Miller, Chopin, and Lawrence all seem to be able to walk that narrow beach of rolling bodies without twisting their ankles on the rocks. They capture the human frailty and power and awkwardness and sensuality of sex without dipping into clich\u00e9 or caricature. I'm not sure why some, few, writers I can handle and most others I just despise. I'm not a prude. I get that sex is a part of life. It isn't icky. I'm not ashamed by it. I realize like food, it is a part of life and thus needs to be represented and shadowed in art and literature.So, with all that baggage and preamble, it was still with quite a bit of trepidation that I slid into Ian McEwan's tight little novella. One reason I think this novel didn't bend me over too much with its very direct narrative about sex was Ian McEwan's mastery of language. He knew exactly what he was doing. He was aiming for an exact mood, a tension, a flick of a finger on a solo hair, an almost anti-climax, to convey the message of this novella. It required a tease, a premature crescendo, and in the end -- the cold, wet, and sticky dialogue of pain and regret."}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "[The photography was excellent, especially in evoking the loneliness of that pebble beach. The sense of period was uncanny, not just in visual details but also practical ones. It\u2019s in the book too, but seeing the unspeakable awfulness of that honeymoon dinner\u2014melon slice with glac\u00e9 cherry, and overcooked roast beef with mixed veg\u2014slammed me with repellent recognition. The leads, Billy Hawle and Saoirse Ronan, were both good, if just a smidgen too old. But also\u2014and this is what matters\u2014too present. The scene in the hotel bedroom soon became excruciating to watch as the camera returned to it again and again. Not that it was inappropriate or in any way pornographic. But the reader manages his own balance between the psychological damage to these two young people and the clumsy physical act in which it is played out. The cinemagoer has to accept the director's balance, and loses a dimension as a result.The screenplay was by McEwan himself. I would need to go back to check, but my impression is that, in contrast to the usual approach of trimmming a novel to make a movie, the author has taken his own trim novella and expanded it. I certainly learned a lot more of the back-story than I recall from the book; I am not sure it was all relevant, however. Edward's family was certainly colorful, but the knowledge did not help me understand his honeymoon problems any better. Although still only hinted at, the relationship between Florence and her father seemed much more significant than anything I had picked up the book. As a result, in terms of the baggage that each brings to the marriage, the focus shifts almost entirely to Florence, as the victim of specific trauma in addition to the general repressed atmosphere of the time. Given her difficulties with physical sex, I don't understand why McEwan plunged her straight away into an apparently successful marriage with somebody else; how did that work any better? Indeed, the filling out of the later lives of the characters is weaker than the rest of this generally strong movie.

I watched the movie adaptation before I began reading the book. The movie was beautiful, the cinematography and the acting were superb. Of course, I was curious to compare how well the book was translated to the screen and what was left out of the book.I can't believe I'm saying this, but the movie was better than the book, as it had a bit more \"meat\". You'd think that because I had the movie visuals in my head, the book would have come to life even more. To be honest, it wasn't the case. Something was amiss and I wanted a bit more to the story. I do admire a great deal that McEwan approached the subject of the wedding night when the two are virgins and have different sexual appetites and expectations. It was different, I can't remember ever reading a book where the woman was so disgusted and apprehensive about anything related to sex. I guess when it comes to sex, the line between sublime and yuck can be very thin.On Chesil Beach was good, but it didn't awe me like the Nutshell.Therefore it's only getting 3.5 stars - rounded up."}, {"userName": "Cody", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18688-cody", "userReview": "I hadn't intended on reading any Ian McEwan in the near future, and this wasn't even atop my McEwan \"to-read\" list. However, as it is short-listed for the Booker, and since I have a tendency to hardly ever keep up with contemporary literature, I was inspired to pick this up at the library yesterday. Then, I proceeded to read it in one sitting.Of course, this rapid reading was very much aided by the length of the book, but this is ultimately an inconsequential reason for my fixation. As with *Atonement*, the only other of his I've read, McEwan here displays the most amazing ability to create such honest and well-developed characters, that it is, for me, seemingly impossible not to attach yourself at least somewhat to the \u201ctheir stories\u201d.While I think that *Atonement* is a more developed work\u2014complex and historical, at once youthfully passionate and bitterly resigned\u2014and, thus literarily, impressed me more, *On Chesil Beach* is, for me, much more affecting. This was due, in part, because I was more willing and able to become wholly enmeshed in the text. It also seemed more relevant to my present life, which, though I often shrink from reviews that make such a point, I must admit allowed me to become more invested, more enveloped in McEwan's tale.Though I claim that *Atonement* is more developed, we should remind ourselves that *On Chesil Beach* is a notably shorter work. I'm astounded at McEwan's ability, in such few words, to create complex characters and themes that are not in the least bit inchoate. The only author I know of who can take on such a multitude of themes in such a concise text is J.M. Coetzee, though he is an utterly different writer than McEwan. Whereas Coetzee is focused more on what we might call the social and the universal, McEwan explores the psychological and the individual. And, yet, through the seemingly specific individuals that McEwan creates, we wholly relate, thus imbuing his themes, emotions, ideas with a kind of universality.This work explores, so beautifully, much of what it means to be young, in love, and attempting to assume adulthood and take the first, daunting steps in an attempt to forge a fulfilling life. And, as I read, my heart simply broke."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "The Young Man's Ego: A Heartbreaking Torpedo?\"This is how the entire course of a life can be changed: by doing nothing.\"This is my first McEwan novel; it's almost a 5 but not quite. I must say, if this short novel is any indication, McEwan is a master of tightening the circles, bit by bit, to mounting tension and then to the Moment, the place and time when opposing forces collide, when choices must be made, and courses must be altered or not.He delicately weaves in the backgrounds of newlyweds Florence, a talented classical string musician, and Edward, a history student without any clear direction for his future but seems earnest nonetheless, as they spend the afternoon and evening of their wedding in a hotel at Chesil Beach on the Dorset seashore. By their backgrounds and internal dialogues on the day of, the reader can see the baggage and expectations each carries: Edward, with his self-centered male ego concerning sex, and Florence, a fear of sex (possibly arising from being sexually abuse as she reached puberty). Use of the term \"possibly\" arises from ambiguities, which must be a McEwan staple in which he intimates but does not say. I was unsure where this would lead, but was awed by McEwan's tightening and fine-tuning tension in the conflict, like the strings on a violin.I enjoyed the novel. I found it rather self-revelatory and poignant and heartrending. Looking back, I detest the male ego I had when I was in my 20s (give or take a few years both ways), when it came to matters of, or relating to, sex.\"It is shaming sometimes, how the body will not, or cannot, lie about emotions.\""}, {"userName": "piperitapitta", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35550351-piperitapitta", "userReview": "\u00c8 strano questo libro: statico, ma soprattutto pensato.

Both of these characters have a lot of growing (and healing) to do and neither one is ready for marriage, and certainly not ready for consummation of any sort. This exquisitely-written story is lovely, sad, and very real all at once. We are watching two people painfully walk on eggshells around each other. They are inexperienced and their preoccupation with the sexual element of marriage causes great internal conflict in terms of expectation, nerves, haunting pasts, and a complete absence of communication about any of it. On Chesil Beach is literary in nature and has deeper underlying issues that readers will likely only pick up on after reading an interview with the author himself (at least that was how it was with me). An interesting snapshot of how marriage may (or may not) function for this particular couple. Note: Be sure to read the interview with the author that is attached to this novel. In my opinion, it is crucial in order to gain the full reading experience and character perspective intended by the author. In the audio, it is located after the book ends but it completely changed the way I viewed the characters.

I found the whole story unrealistic and artificial and some of the writing lazy .we are asked to believe that 2 people so in love and apparently still so years after their disasterous wedding night should not have found a way to overcome the inauspicious start .we are also led to believe that somehow this problem was because they were living in an era before sex was invented and emotional problems were talked about .this warped view is also compounded by the post Florence life of Edward which as the years roll on seems to be exaggeratedly liberated .it's suddenly all freelove and drugs . the two characters seem to be cyphers for their generation .The fact that she lived in Oxford , was a classical musician , hated pop music , had a distant father , an intellectual mother and lived in upper middle class Summertown are a lazy shorthand to explain her reticence about lurv making .he of course lived outside in the country , geddit , loved rock music ,and had a charmingly chaotic crazy family , is just a normal bloke eager to get his hands on a girl and marriage seemed to only way . that two so disimilar people should be in love at all was totally daft . the author also ruins the scene setting by intruding from his desk and computer to says things like \" this was not a good moment in English cuisine \" , the poor things no ciabbata , so unsophisticated !Iiving in Oxford i did like the local references but if you lived in Croydon i should not think this meant much . it would just reinforce the idea that everyone in Oxford was called Rupert and cycled everywhere with a basket on his bike . ok some people do .if this was someone's first novel all this would be accepted but as the umpteenth novel from McEwan it all seems very narrow and unreal and superficial , so there !

It's just embarrassing. Why bother? Ugh._______________I am really glad I didn't read this book when I was a kid. If it had existed then and I'd come across it, between On Chesil Beach and Bell Jar I would've almost certainly gotten me to a nunnery, and I'd be there right now (though come to think of it, would that be such a bad thing?).Actually, I think I read this at precisely the right stage of my life. I see that not all the Booksters on here loved it so much, while to me it was just about perfect. So far both McEwan books I've read have dealt with sex and class, but also with this project of looking back at the past and trying to make sense of it, and of the ways we choose to do or not do certain things, at how we make decisions and conduct relationships with one another, and in this fumbling, unguided way wind up doing what it is that makes our lives. McEwan shows us history and the people trapped inside it, and he offers up a counterpoint to the Talking Heads song about days going by with a different view of the mechanics by which we each wind up having lived a certain life.... if that makes any sense, and it probably doesn't the muddled way I've explained it. Well, it does to me, and I actually thought this book accomplished it much more successfully than Atonement, which I also really liked.I think Ian McEwan is a terrific writer. I bet if I'd read him a another point in my life I wouldn't be responding so enthusiastically, but right now his stuff is making a lot of sense to me.I also love that he wrote a short, careful book. More people should do that. Everything doesn't need to be so big and sprawling. An excruciatingly crafted sex scene can be just as impressive as a multigenerational epic, in five hundred fewer pages.

Florence is a talented musician who dreams of a career on the concert stage and of the perfect life she will create with Edward, an earnest young history student at University College of London, who unexpectedly wooed and won her heart. Newly married that morning, both virgins, Edward and Florence arrive at a hotel on the Dorset coast. At dinner in their rooms they struggle to suppress their worries about the wedding night to come. Edward, eager for rapture, frets over Florence\u2019s response to his advances and nurses a private fear of failure, while Florence\u2019s anxieties run deeper: she is overcome by sheer disgust at the idea of physical contact, but dreads disappointing her husband when they finally lie down together in the honeymoon suite.Ian McEwan has caught with understanding and compassion the innocence of Edward and Florence at a time when marriage was presumed to be the outward sign of maturity and independence. On Chesil Beach is another masterwork from McEwan\u2014a story of lives transformed by a gesture not made or a word not spoken.", "title": "On Chesil Beach", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9953.On_Chesil_Beach", "average": 3.56, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320390236l/9953.jpg", "reviews": 5751, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2408.Ian_McEwan", "name": "Ian McEwan"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction", "European Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9953.On_Chesil_Beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1912028.On_Chesil_Beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/815309.On_Chesil_Beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17425743-on-chesil-beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1913462.On_Chesil_Beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8123605-chesil-beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20626167-ezil-bi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6867.Atonement", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5015.Saturday", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21965107-the-children-act", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13562049-sweet-tooth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6862.Amsterdam"]}
