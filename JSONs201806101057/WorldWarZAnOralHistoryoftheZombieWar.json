Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations and I struggled to finish it. (I'm going to write this review under the assumption that the reader has some inkling about the story and how it's constructed.)There are two issues that killed it for me. Firstly, most of the characters had the same--or similar--voice. Of course this is partly to do with the fact that the voices all originate from the mind of one individual, the author. Also, the more journalistic/interview approach to constructing the narrative limits how much color the author can impart on any given character. Q and A is inherently dry, no matter how exciting the events described are intended to be. This is a minor gripe, though, and one that can be lived with.A more serious complaint, however, is that this book can be seen as completely lacking any and all dramatic tension that a person (or, me) expects from a survival horror-themed story. The primary draw--the zombie war and how humanity survived--is such a compelling hook, but it's told...by the people who survived. As in, past tense, as in we are left with their impressions of things that happened to them. Basically, then, the story devolves into an excercise in basic exposition: \"And then this happened, and then that happened.\" And so the author is free to weave his story without any pesky things like character development, story arcs, plotting, and personal details that are shown and not told. It seems to me like an extraordinarily easy (maybe even lazy) way to tell a story. One other minor point: For me, accounts of survival when the victims are real have meaning that allows them to transcend the limitations described above. WW2 Holocaust survivors' accounts, for example, can take your breath away. The difference is, of course, that they were real events that happened to real people. Since all the classic storytelling elements are dispensed with, we're basically left with the author's views on our current world, particularly and naturally, the wars and our culture(s). However, it's my view that there are dozens of books written about these subjects already; books that haven't needed to sex the discussion up with a horde of shambling undead. So, in summary, if I'm going to read an apocalyptic recounting of the end of civilization as we know it, I want to read about people in real time, struggling to survive, not being told how people surivived after it was over. (I realize, though, that it's all a matter of taste, as I know half a dozen people whose views I respect that absolutely loved this book.) :D"}, {"userName": "Jason Pettus", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus", "userReview": "(My full review of this book is longer than Goodreads' word-count limitations; find the entire essay at the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com].)Anytime I hear of some funny, gimmicky book suddenly becoming popular among the hipster set, I always squint my eyes and brace myself for the worst; because usually when it comes to such books, the worst is all you can expect to find, an endless series of fluffy pop-culture pieces designed specifically for crafty point-of-purchase display at your favorite corporate superstore, and then a year later to be forgotten by society altogether. And so it's been in the last six months as I've heard more and more about this book World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, which supposedly is a hilarious \"actual\" oral history about an apocalyptic war with the undead that supposedly almost wiped out the human race as we know it; even worse, that it had been inspired by an actual gimmicky point-of-purchase humor book, the dreadful Zombie Survival Guide from a few years ago which had been published specifically and only to make a quick buck off the \"overly specific survival guide\" craze of the early 2000s. And even worse than all this, the author of both is Max Brooks, as in the son of comedy legend Mel Brooks; and if the son of a comedy legend is trawling the literary gutters of gimmicky point-of-purchase humor books, the chances usually are likely that they have nothing of particular interest to say.So what a surprise, then, to read the book myself this month, and realize that it's not a gimmicky throwaway humor book at all, but rather a serious and astute look at the next 50 years of global politics, using a zombie outbreak as a metaphorical stand-in for any of the pervasive challenges facing us as an international culture these days (terrorism, global warming, disease, natural disasters), showing with the precision of a policy analyst just how profoundly the old way of doing things is set to fail in the near future when some of these challenges finally become crises. It is in fact an astoundingly intelligent book, as \"real\" as any essay by Seth Godin or Malcolm Gladwell, basically imagining the debacle of New Orleans multiplied by a million, then imagining what would happen if the Bushists were to react to such a thing in the same way; and even more astounding, Brooks posits that maybe the real key to these future challenges lies with the citizens of third-world countries, in that they are open to greater and faster adaptability than any fat, lazy, middle-class American or European ever could be. Oh yeah, and it's got face-eating zombies too. Did I mention the face-eating zombies?Because that's the thing to always remember, that this comes from an author who has spent nearly his entire life in the world of comedy and gimmicky projects, not only from family connections but also his own job as a staff writer at Saturday Night Live from 2001 to '03; that no matter how smart World War Z gets (and it gets awfully smart at points), it is still ultimately a fake oral history of an apocalyptic zombie war that supposedly takes place just five or ten years from now, starting as these messes often do as a series of isolated outbreaks in remote third-world villages. And in fact this is where Brooks first starts getting his political digs in, right from the first page of the manuscript itself, by using the initial spread of the zombie virus to comment on the way such past epidemics like HIV have been dealt with by the corrupt old white males who used to be in charge of things; basically, by ignoring the issue as long as it wasn't affecting fellow white males, then only paying attention after it's become an unstoppable epidemic. In Brooks' world, just like the real one of pre-9/11 intelligence-gathering, we see that a few government smarties from around the world really were able to catch the implications of this mysterious new virus while it was still theoretically controllable; just that their memos and papers went ignored for political reasons by those actually in charge, as well as getting lost in the vast bureaucratic shuffle that the Cold War has created in the Western military-industrial complex.That's probably the most pleasurable part of the first half, to tell you the truth, and by \"pleasurable\" I mean \"witty and humorous in a bleak, horrifying, schauenfreude kind of way\" -- of watching the virus become more and more of a threat, of watching entire cities start to go under because of the zombie epidemic, then watching Brooks paint an extremely thinly-veiled portrait of how the Bush administration would deal with such a situation, and by extension any government ruled by a small cabal of backwards, power-hungry religious fundamentalists. And in this, then, World War Z suddenly shifts from a critique about AIDS to a critique about Iraq, showing how in both situations (the Middle East and zombies, that is) the real priority of the people currently in charge is to justify all the trillions of dollars spent at traditional weapon manufacturing companies under the old Cold-War system (companies, by the way, where all the people in charge have lucrative executive jobs when they're not being the people in charge), leading to such ridiculous situations as a full-on tank and aircraft charge mostly for the benefit of the lapdog press outlets who are there covering the \"first grand assault.\" In Iraq, unfortunately, we found that a billion dollars in tanks still can't stop a teenage girl with a bomb strapped to her chest; and metaphorically that might be the most chilling scene in the entirety of World War Z as well, the press-friendly \"zombie response\" set up by the Bush-led government in New York's Yonkers neighborhood, done not for good strategic reasons but rather to show off the billions of dollars in weapons the government had recently acquired, leading to a virtual slaughter of all the soldiers and journalists there by the chaotic zombie hoard that eventually arrives.This, then, gets us into the first futuristic posit of Brooks in the novel to not have actually happened in real life yet -- the \"Great Panic,\" that is, when the vast majority of humans suddenly lose faith in whatever government was formerly running their section of the world, and where mass anarchy and chaos leads to the accidental and human-on-human deaths of several hundreds of millions of more people. And again, by detailing a fictional tragedy like a global zombie epidemic, and the complete failure of a Bush-type administration to adequately respond to it, Brooks is eerily predicting here such real situations like last week's complete meltdown of Bear Stearns (the fifth largest investment bank in the entire United States), leading many to start wondering for the first time what exactly would happen if the US dollar itself was to experience the same kind of whirlwind collapse, a collapse that happens so fast (in a single business day in the case of Bear Stearns) that no one in the endless red tape of the government itself has time to actually respond to it?Brooks' answer here is roughly the same one Cormac McCarthy proposed in last year's Pulitzer-winning The Road; chaos, bloodshed, violence, inhumanity, an everyone-for-themselves mentality from the very people we trusted to lead us in such times of crisis. Make no mistake, this is a damning and devastating critique of the corrupt conservatives currently in charge of things; a book that uses the detritus of popular culture to masquerade as a funny and gross book about zombies, but like the best fantastical literature in history is in fact a prescient look at our current society. It's unbelievable, in fact, how entertaining and engrossing this novel is throughout its middle, given how this is usually the part of any book that is the slowest and least interesting; here Brooks uses the naturally slow middle of his own story to make the majority of his political points, and to get into a really wonky side of global politics that is sure to satisfy all you hardcore policy junkies (as well as military fetishists).Because that's the final thing important to understand about World War Z, is that it's a novel with a truly global scope; Brooks here takes on not only what such a zombie epidemic would do to our familiar US of A, but also how such an epidemic would spread in the village-centric rural areas of southeast Asia, the infrastructure-poor wastelands of Russia and more, and especially how each society fights the epidemic in slightly different ways, some with more success than others. For example, Brooks posits that in such places as India, population density is just too high to do much of any good; in his fictional world history, such countries are basically decimated by such a catastrophe, with there basically being few humans even left in India by the time everything is over. Other countries, though, used to picking up as a nation and fleeing for other lands, survive the zombie outbreaks quite well; those who are already used to being refugees, for example, see not too much of a difference in their usual lifestyle from this latest turn in events, ironically making them the societies most suited for survival in such a world. (This is opposed to all the clueless middle-class Americans in the novel, for example, who in a panic make for the wilds of northern Canada, in the blind hope that the winter weather will freeze the zombies into non-action; although that turns out to be true, poor planning unfortunately results in the deaths of tens of millions of people anyway, from hypothermia and starvation and plain ol' mass-murder.)And this is ultimately what I mean by this book being such a politically astute one; because as..."}, {"userName": "Penny", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/679025-penny", "userReview": "I know what you're thinking. \"Five stars for this book? Why???\" If you've been following my reviews then you know I tend to stress over how many stars to give a book, and I'm not one to hand out five-star ratings willy-nilly. I'm usually quite cautious when it comes to handing out that all-important fifth star. I'm stingy. That being said, every once in a while a book, that may or may not be amazing, comes along and wows me. And now you're (probably) thinking: \"But Penny, it's a book about zombies. Zombies! Disgusting rotting corpses that stumble around, looking to sink their teeth into any living thing. How--how could that sort of thing wow you? Are you, like, smoking crack???\" First things first: No--I'm not smoking crack. Everyone knows crack is cheap--I much prefer the real thing*. Now that I've cleared that up, lets move on, shall we? So. World War Z. I really enjoyed it, which was a surprise because I didn't think I would. This book is not something I would've picked up on my own. Had it not been for a couple of really nice Barnes & Noble employees who practically shoved this book in my hands while gushing about its supreme awesomeness, I definitely wouldn't have purchased it. But since they didn't have the book I was looking for (Storm Front by Jim Butcher), and since I'd already been bitten by the zombie bug over a year ago (The Forest of Hands and Teeth by Carrie Ryan) I took a chance and purchased this book.Despite the fact that Max Brooks used to write for SNL, and also happens to be Mel Brooks son, this book isn't funny, nor is it meant to be. Max Brooks tells this story through a series of interviews given by survivors of The Great Panic, or World War Z (the Z stands for Zombie, in case you didn't, you know, put two and two together...).The interviewees come from different parts of the world and they tell their accounts of what happened to them, what they thought when they first heard of what was first referred to as \"African Rabies\"; what happened when the Great Panic started in their part of the world. A lot of these stories are sad and/or terrifying, but mostly I found them incredibly intriguing. Before I go on I need to add that I totally geek-out over documentaries, and this book--were it in movie form--would be a documentary. I'm one that appreciates the method Max Brooks uses to tell this story. To me the beginning of this book has more to do with the way things are done in this world--politics wise--than anything else. Of course, as the book goes on and more and more governments are collapsing due to the fact that zombies are basically taking over the world, we get a good look at human nature during times of crisis. I found the whole thing fascinating.. Hardcore zombie lovers need to know that this isn't a book that follows one set of characters, though some interviews have been broken up, and so a few characters are featured in this book more than once. Rather it is one story told by several different people. There is continuity in the order in which the stories are told to us, and sometimes one survivor's account answers a question that was raised by another survivor.All that said, there is quite a bit of zombie slaying action. Lots of blood and guts and gore. We get to learn how best to stop a zombie--and let me assure you, there are many ways. We also learn about newest in improvised zombie killing weaponry and effective warfare techniques to decimate a raging-out-of-control zombie population. But seriously, I loved reading it, everything in this whole entire book. Me. A church-going mother of three. Although, yeah, I'm not your typical church-going mother of three. But still... P.S. I'd have finished this book a long time ago had it not been for my husband, who kept stealing this book away from me so he could read it too. He's really liking it, btw. UPDATE 11/10/12: About a year ago I bought the audiobook from Audible only to discover, after purchasing, that it was the abridged version. I soon found out that was all they had to offer which was quite disappointing because some of my favorite eyewitness accounts from the book were not included. I've since heard from the World War Z's Facebook page that they are going to make an unabridged version. I am unaware of when it will be available for purchase. That said, I did end up liking the (abridged) audiobook well enough. The performances are pretty top notch. *To those who have zero sense of humor, it must be said: I'm kidding, I don't do any drugs, and you need to chill."}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "At this current moment in time my husband and I do not actually have a working will. We are the legal definition of intestate. We have not yet made any preparations for our death and we only have life insurance/house insurance because his mother organized the whole damn thing (come to mention it she is also the reason we have electricity, water and a phone line - the internet though was all us because we'd die without it.)So believe me when I say that we don't organize... anything. Except our zombie kit. That's right. We have a zombie kit. Should zombies suddenly strike while I type out this review we would be able to take our son and get in our car and drive away without a backward glance. Everything we need is in the boot of the car. If we're holed up inside the house we have our second zombie kit to live off of and use to defend ourselves. We have several plans in place as to where to go, what to do if we're separated at time of crisis, who we're taking with us, how we'll stay in contact etc.Some may call his paranoia. Some may call this stupidity. Do you know what I call these naysayers? Zombie food.It is this obsessive and weird need to ensure survival during a zombie apocalypse, despite every rational reason to believe that all our efforts are for naught, that has made me the prime candidate and target group of this book. It is not the norm of the zombie genre. In general a zombie movie tends to be about a small group of individuals against the undead hordes looking to floss with intestines. This book is not about a small group of individuals - it is about a large collection of humanity. This book is how HUMANITY would survive and deal with a zombie infestation. It is a collection of small, broken narratives from people all over the world, across many social, economic and political classes. Some of them were amazing, others horrifying. Some were inspirational, others so depressing or introspective that I wondered if there was any hope.I would argue that many of the \"voices\" from certain nationalities were not really very accurate and didn't really match the cultural region they came from - but I'm lazy. Either you \"get\" the voice of the narratives or you don't.This book was a fascinating, thoughtful read in a field that I'm personally obsessed with. I could easily understand how those who've never stayed up until three in the morning, drunk off their heads with a group of people yelling that if they head into the city then they're zombie meat (Zombie meat I say! You ridiculous idiots!) probably will find this book a hard read.It's also a difficult read in the sense that you are continually sucked into one story, only to have it end abruptly and shift to another. I kept getting frustrated and wanting to scream, \"No! Go back! I want to know what else happened!\" but alas. It's like little snap shots from all over the world, except when it comes to several of the snapshots, I'd really rather see the whole picture.Other than that, I loved it. I had a hoot reading it. It gave me plenty of fodder with which to have many drunken debates with my husband, brothers and friends.Much to their disgust..."}, {"userName": "Rebecca DeLaTorre", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1159175-rebecca-delatorre", "userReview": "I just can't get on this bandwagon. The pseudo-government reports the book is written in handicap it in many ways. First, there are no protagonists to grow with, no story arc, no climax, etc. You know what's going to happen from day one--there was a world crisis involving zombies and at least some people live to tell the tale. The sure knowledge of the outcome deflates any tension and book feels flacid. The pseudo-scientific jargon is a poor imitation (my sister, a nurse, tossed aside Brooks' other Zombie manfesto in disgust within the first few pages and this one fairs no better)and there are far too many emotional pauses and descriptive introductions for what amounts to an addendum to a government study of events. The thing that put me over the edge with this book is the inconsistency--one chapter has a boy with bloody knuckles sliding his hands about in zombie goo and remaining uninfected and in the next chapter there is an expression of gratitutde that no one exposed to detrius from a headshot has open wounds to be infected through. What editor let that get by? On top of that, racial, national stereotypes abound and are crude and unappealing. Brooks is obviously a big fan of Israel, as they are the heroes of the day, even going so far as to selflessly save Palestinian refugees (yeah, right)and remnants of South Africa's apartheid system are given a reprieve due to their pragmatism. Russians are wacky comrades, Chinamen are inscrutable and Americans are cowboys weakened by education and consumerism. Ugh.I won't recommend this book to anyone, even a die hard zombie fan, lest World War Z ruin the genre for them forever."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201dThe book of war, the one we\u2019ve been writing since one ape slapped another was completely useless in this situation. We had to write a new one from scratch.\u201dWith most apocalyptic situations, I think the hardest part to deal with is that there are no wrong decisions or right decisions. There are simply too many variables to consider if your ultimate goal is to survive. The most meticulously planned strategies can still result in failure. You make the best decisions you can and then hope for a bit of luck. Should we barricade ourselves hoping to be saved, or go North hoping the zombies will eventually become popsicles when winter hits? Are we safer in the underground tunnels of Paris or on a cruise ship or living in the woods by ourselves? Whatever decision you make, you must think long game and short game. The short game, the immediate concerns, involve food, water, and shelter. The short and long game both come into play when trying to figure out how to avoid becoming zombie chow. Once you survive the first wave of contagion, then what?This book is written as an investigative report, collecting all the experiences of survivors from around the world. Different cultures reacted differently to the apocalypse. Some were more successful than others. The learning curve, unfortunately, has to be short with apocalyptic situations, especially if the hope is to actually salvage civilisation. The lights go out, and many of the comforts we\u2019ve become accustomed to are gone instantly, and the possessions that have come to define us, such as electronic devices, suddenly become useless. If the whole idea of a zombie apocalypse is too wild a concept for you to grasp, you might be relieved that for the most part the zombies are really just part of the background. What Max Brooks is really dealing with goes well beyond the concept of zombies and focuses more on how people survived the collapse of civilisation. He could have used microbes or conventional war or a devastating meteorite hitting the earth or any of the other fascinating concepts that people have come up with as ways to end the world. It reads like books of a similar nature that collect the stories of people who survived World War Two. The scope is huge and impressive. Brooks addresses aspects about a zombie apocalypse that I have never thought about before. Quislings \u201dYeah, you know, the people that went nutballs and started acting like zombies.\u201d Ok, I\u2019ve read a handful of zombie books, not enough to make myself an expert, but certainly enough to have some background on the lore of a zombie apocalypse. WTH? Now Brooks didn\u2019t just make this term up. It is a term from WW2. \u201dA quisling is a person who collaborates with an enemy occupying force. The word originates from the Norwegian war-time leader Vidkun Quisling, who headed a domestic Nazi collaborationist regime during the Second World War.\u201dThe minds of survivors, I\u2019m sure, snapped in all kinds of strange and wonderful and terrifying ways, but unfortunately pretending to be a zombie was a quick way to find yourself...well...dead. First, any reasonably sane human who notices you lurching toward them, performing your very best mimicry of the undead, will smash your brain. Second, you don\u2019t blend with the zombies. They know you are alive. You become a zombie delight!People also just went to sleep perfectly healthy and didn\u2019t wake up. This was called ADS, short for Asymptomatic Demise Syndrome or Apocalyptic Despair Syndrome. \u201dIt killed as many people in those early stalemate months as hunger, disease, interhuman violence, or the living dead.\u201d I\u2019ve heard of things like this happening to people who experience long term stress situations. The body just reaches a point where the brain decides to just shut down the power to the spacecraft and let the mind drift away. RIPPeople will put up with a lot as long as there is hope that someday their situation will improve. Babies die when they are not held. People die when things become hopeless. Brooks also told stories about zombies underwater. WTH? Yeah, people reanimated as the living dead on ships and eventually managed to fall off the ship in the water. It wasn\u2019t unusual for zombies to just walk out of the water onto beaches or grab divers or attack fishermen in boats. Somehow they are more scary underwater than on land. It gives me the shivers just thinking about it. I\u2019m having a Jaws flashback. During and after WWZ, people had to relearn things that our grandparents and great grandparents knew. A chimney sweep. \u201dI help keep my neighbors warm.\u201d he said proudly.A cobbler. \u201dYou see those shoes. I made them.\u201dA shepherd. \u201dThat sweater, that\u2019s my sheep\u2019s wool.\u201dA gardener/farmer. \u201d Like that corn? My garden.\u201d\u201dThat was the upshot of a more localized system. It gave people the opportunity to see the fruits of their labor, it gave them a sense of individual pride to know they were making a clear, concrete contribution to victory, and it gave me a wonderful feeling that I was part of that. I needed that feeling. It kept me sane for the other part of my job.\u201dThe other part of his job?...killing zombies. Several of the survivors talked about how important it was not to think of them as people or of who they were or of who they might have become. They couldn\u2019t see them as people or what they were doing was genocide. This is by far the most serious zombie book I\u2019ve ever read. The stories are compelling. This is a panoramic view of a society in crises. The observations are thoughtful. The writing is convincing. By the end I had the feeling I\u2019d just read a history book, not a speculative zombie apocalyptic book. The book is unfilmable, but the movie industry knew a catchy title when they saw one. They certainly borrowed aspects from the book, but really the movie should be considered a completely different entity. The zombies in Brooks book are the George Romero lurching, yucky living dead. In the movie, they are super charged, fast moving, aggressive, nasty creatures. The virus in the movie is fast acting. Someone bitten is transformed within seconds. In the book, the virus takes much longer to take effect. Did it bother me that the director Marc Forster took such liberties? Not one bite bit. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I was thoroughly entertained. I certainly intend to watch the movie again. So read the book to discover new depths to an overly exploited genre, and watch the movie to experience a whirlwind of fear and dread. Just a suggestion, have someone else hold the popcorn.

This rule I've alluded to is the following - I don't read the book directly before the movie (at least 1 year before or it must be read after or just wait on the movies). The reason for this is that I want to enjoy the story through both mediums and if you read the book just before the movie, you've set yourself up to be a critic - analyzing everything and complaining about every detail that's inevitably left out, but which is more often than not necessary for the medium.If you read the book at least a year before, at least with my shoddy memory, the movie becomes a happy time of fond remembrances. Oh yeah, I remember that part, so cool! Yay! Happy! In this instance, I hear the movie doesn't quite follow the book exactly and what else can that mean than that it's a typical zombie movie. I don't think I've ruined much here.You know, it could have been partly because of all the hype, but I didn't love this book. I didn't hate it either, which makes these the hardest reviews to write, but I think I have a few ideas why World War Z just didn't work all that well for me.I'm studying for the bar at the moment, so you get an extremely well-organized review (at least with headings aplenty) since that's how my brain is thinking at the moment. :)The PlotDoesn't really exist. Yeah, there's a loose series of events that defines the book, or the Zombie War, but it's told through interviews with different survivors from different countries. And they're short too, I even checked this with the book (paper-form). Each interview amounts to a page or two, maybe 5 max. Each tends to discuss a certain important event, which ends up getting referred to by characters later in the book and often mentioned by the one directly following.It's extremely clever and lets you see how well developed this whole idea is.It's extremely cleverMax Brooks has literally thought of everything when it comes to a war against zombies. I thought the same in my reading of The Zombie Survival Guide, and it goes just as well here. EVERYTHING!He goes into why tanks are all but useless against hordes of zombies - because you have to take out their heads! Anything else, and they'll still shamble and probably even become more dangerous when you trip over them on the ground. The airforce is just as useless because it's so much money and effort for such a little amount of good. Better spent on a bunch of soldiers with tons of amo. He even goes into better strategies for fighting this war, why the zombies are such a good enemy - because they don't need to be bred, fed, or led as I'll let the book explain. Very clever and not even pretentious about it. Just captivating. And this isn't the only thing I liked although we're getting into the middle ground because I didn't love the audio either.The AudioOne of the things that got me excited to listen to this on audio was that it's read by a full cast. That means they're trying REALLY hard and that tends to be a good thing, especially if you don't like one or two of the voices, it's okay, it's only temporary. With just one narrator, that can really kill a book. I mentioned that this is told through many different people in different countries and they have actors like Rob Reiner and John Turturro. Even Max Brooks himself plays the part of the interviewer. (John Turturro from The Big Lebowski)Very cool...until the point of distraction. There are so many different countries represented that the accents started to distract heavily from the story. I found myself pondering why the German guy had such a heavy accent on his \"R's\" and yet could perfectly pronounce \"TH\" every time. And this was just the one guy. One of the benefits of a single narrator is that even when they do an accent, it's easier to understand because English is their primary language. The audio's great for the most part, outside of that little niggle about the accents, but one thing I absolutely HATE about it is...it's abridged!AbridgedI would probably never forgive myself if I listened to this abridged audio version and never actually read the entire book if I actually thought that mattered. Maybe others are better sleuths than myself, but I can't find a reading of World War Z that's not abridged. At the same, after having read the book, the abridged version seems to do enough justice to the entirety of the novel, what with how it is organized, that it just cuts out a few of the interviews.Normally this is heresy, but I can live with it for this one time only.What I didn't likeI think the thing that just makes this an okay to good book for me is that while it's style and organization is unique and highly clever, it also takes away from my ability to care. Without just following one person or a group of people, there's no attachment to any specific person. The Movie(Brad Pitt will make everything better.)After writing the above, I actually do think the movie will make it all better. It seems like it will be following one single person and that's what this reader needs. Movie's set for a June 2013 release. Here's the trailer too.In the end (in the sense of my final feelings not any post-apocalyptic sense)Let's just say, if we ever do get into a Zombie War, you better have a copy of World War Z and The Zombie Survival Guide on you. Someone's already gone through the effort of thinking up EVERY situation that can occur, what's effective, what's not and put it down in words. No sense reinventing the wheel.While an entertaining idea and clever execution, these were the exact things that made World War Z a book I could never love. It's worth a read if only to see how in-depth you have not thought about zombies.3 out of 5 Stars (Recommended with Reservations)The movie, an updateI just wanted to make a quick note about the movie. I'm happy to say I called it correctly. I enjoyed the movie much more than the book even though you can really only say the movie is a loose adaptation (if you can even say that). I thought it was much better to visit all those countries through the single character of the UN agent as opposed to interviews of random characters. I felt for him trying to protect his family, I rooted for him when he was in danger, and it had the same effect of exploring the reaction of different cultures (to a much smaller degree of course). And it actually scared me, which for a zombie book, was completely lacking in WWZ."}, {"userName": "John Wiswell", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell", "userReview": "There are reasons to be wary of this book. The title is a little silly, and Max Brooks's Zombie Survival Guide was tongue in cheek. Hell, he's the son of legendary comedy director Mel Brooks. And zombies are creatures that gained popularity thanks to film, which is contrary to the nature of most good creatures. Vampires, ghosts, wizards, witches, dragons, orcs, goblins, angels, werewolves and even Frankenstein's undead abomination came from literature first, and entered film later. Film seldom contributes originality to prose. Fortunately Max Brooks pulled off a minor miracle in adapting the largely theatrical terror into the written word, by use of the literary apocalypse convention and oral stories. Our familiarity with the outlines of a zombie outbreak (or any plague outbreak) from so many films helps fill in the gaps between his various storytellers' accounts.Brooks has a remarkable sense of voice, and places the various interviewees well, such that they sound all the more distinct in contrast to the preceeding and following speaker. We get a lot of interesting subjects, from the country doctor in China who treated the first \"bite,\" to a hitman hired to protect a millionaire mogul, to a blind man who somehow managed to survive in the most infested parts of Japan - Hiroshima. Thus we also get a total sense of the rise and fall of the outbreak, with each arc illustrated by brilliant personal narratives of \"true\" stories from those periods that give us a sense of not just the plot, but how culture changed in this fictional earth. The narrative is unified by the interviewer who visits them and directs parts of their story, but only enough so that we can both enjoy the overarching plot and the survivors' stories.Like the best science fiction the outlandish premise allows us to get a fresh view of real human issues. Brooks approaches such issues on multiple levels, from simple human interests like base selfishness and how we act in desperation, to political crises, such as early on in the book when the Israelis and Palestinians blame each other for the plague, and even claim it is a hoax perpetrated by their enemies. Many of the characters are inspired by people from real life, like Howard Dean, Karl Rove and Nelson Mandela - but rather than coming off as cheesy, they lend an air of authenticity to the tale. There is just enough real tension, both base and topical, to lend it the right aura for a great exercise in modern fantasy/sci fi - it's easily one of the best fantasy/sci fi books set in the modern world I've read in quite some time.The quality of Brooks's book was totally unexpected. This was supposed to be a spin-off from an impulse-buy. But by the time you finish World War Z I think you'll hope along with me that this, his first work of fiction, won't be his last."}, {"userName": "Alex Duncan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2868168-alex-duncan", "userReview": "This book is not a novel. You learn very little about the characters (even the narrator) and cannot follow them from story to story. There's no common thread, no arc, etc. It's a hodgepodge. For many of you, this is all you need to know about this book.If you're looking for a great zombie NOVEL, my favorite is Cryonic: A Zombie NovelI suppose there are parallels between the book and the movie in the sense that both are disjointed. It's too big a story to tell and to be done properly Brooks should have written a door stopper of a novel.That said, he did piece together an interesting scenario: a world where humans have fought back against the zombies and won. This aspect is shown at the end of the film, as they elude to the inevitable sequel, and it's actually the most interesting part of the book, that is:- how did they fight and how'd they win- what challenges did they face- in what ways were they no match for the zombiesThat third bullet is an aspect I have the most difficulty with as there's so much of \"bombs didn't work on the zombies\" type of statements from those the narrators interviewed. Call me crazy, but if you drop a big 'ole bomb on a zombie hord there aren't going to be many \"walking\" dead around after that.I suppose this book's format will appeal to some people, as many seem to be OK with what he's done, but it's such a huge disappointment when you were expecting a novel and don't get one. The book actually has a decent start with the story of patient zero and the images of zombies grabbing ankles from beneath the depths of a flooded city, but it goes downhill quickly from there. It's really a chore to read because the stories are so short that they don't allow you to connect with the characters. I have a feeling if Brooks hadn't had so much success with his Zombie Survival Guide that publishers would have turned their nose up at the structure of this book and made him rewrite it. At the same time, Brooks and his publisher have made quit a bit of coin on this one so who can blame them?Some stories provide enough detail to suck you in and get good (that is just before the end on you abruptly), but others are what I call Brooks' bastards because he gives them so little attention you wonder why they are in there at all.There's also one story that despite being long is incredibly boring about a stolen Chinese submarine that takes up enough pages to account for several other stories. Definitely an err in judgment there.With no one to root for and no characters to follow, you'll find yourself not caring whether you open the book back up or not. To me, this is the ultimate sin any book can commit. To call this the best zombie book ever written, etc. etc. is so far off the mark I can't even tell you.If any of what I'm saying is speaking to you I wouldn't spend your money on the book as it will surely disappoint."}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "On the menu tonight: \nWORLD WAR Z\nAmuse BoucheOur rich Tartare \u00e0 la Homo Sapien will astonish you with its hauntingly familiar flavors, its bright and vivid colors, and the truly gamey taste of terror, tears, and trauma.

Okay then.I was also hoping for more civilian accounts of the zombie war, but unfortunately most of the people who spoke were either in the military, or were scientists or something of that nature. So they kind of just talked about the military aspects of the war, and while that may be really exciting for some people to read about, it just wasn't for me.I also find it difficult to enjoy a book when the whole time you know how it ends (as this takes place AFTER the war is over).

Not at all the typical zombie book, and not at all what I expected. Published in 2006, the issues and underlying plot points are as pertinent today as then. What would happen in a real zombie apocalypse? Given current politics, economics, cultural trends, and geography, I'd be willing to bet it happens closely to Brooks' vision.World War Z  is structured along the lines of a documentary, a collection of remembrances about the world-wide zombie war. Divided by chronological order, one can get the feel of the evolution from chapter headings: \"Warnings,\" \"Blame,\" \"The Great Panic,\" \"Turning the Tide\" \"Home Front USA,\" \"Around the World and Above,\" \"Total War,\" and \"Good-byes.\" \"Warnings\" begins with a doctor in China responding to a remote village to a request for help. His tale lures the reader in, giving an intimate view of the initial confusion, the fear, the drastic response by the state, and the systemic holes that lead to ultimate break down. From there, the interviewer talks to a human smuggler in Tibet, drug war agents in Greece, a black-market surgeon in Brazil, a laborer from South Africa, a member of Israeli intelligence, and a repatrioted Palestinian. It's a brilliant idea for a narrative about a global issue, because each culture group frames the problem in terms of its own narrow focus (how could it not?), giving the reader insight into how confronting any issue takes place in a morass of history--but also how similar we are at the individual level. And, unfortunately, the degree to which personal selfishness, both altruistic (saving loved ones) and greedy, pave the way for worsening disaster.Further interviews include the ordinary survivor (who was anything but), soldiers, an astronaut, and various government officials including the vice-president and a diplomat. It makes for an extremely interesting analysis, because it covers both the personal, private story and the larger, world arc.Ultimately, it was a sobering and satisfying commentary on humanity and the current state of the world. While that sounds potentially dull and analytical, structuring the story around a zombie war is frosting on the vegan cupcake. While it possibly could have been as strong of a narrative if Brooks was imagining a virulent and lethal virus, zombies gave it a flash factor that draws dystopia fans in. Besides, reanimated dead do create challenges of their own that would be unique in warfare. One general talks about how traditional warfare centers around people that are \"bred, led and fed.\" Zombies require none of those things--their ranks grow with death, they require no leaders, so it is not possible to remove key strategists in a campaign, and they don't require any sort of supplies or rest, so there is no possibility of destroying a supply line. Underwater environments prove to be the long-term zombie reservoir, presenting unique challenges to world-wide eradication.Minor quibbles include a lack of some of the science behind the outbreak, as well as that of the lone survivors. And, while it is a thought-provoking story over all, it's not exactly a gripping one that kept me up at night. That's actually okay, as it proved more satisfying in the long run. Just temper your expectations.In some ways, this was the complete antithesis of Zone One, (review: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...) which examines the zombie post-apocalypse through the individual and humanity's slide downward. This looks at zombie wars through multiple viewpoints on a world-wide scale, and it's ultimate message is hope with cost. I highly recommend to zombie or science-dabbling fans.

I said it and I accept it. Because the majority of my friends really, really loved this book. And I fear they will reject me now that they know that it did little to nothing for me. I shall have to sit alone in the library, other readers keeping a wide berth for fear of contagion, but I cannot tell a lie and I stand by my pronouncement: Hi, my name is Amanda and I did not enjoy World War Z. In the past, I have ripped into books I disliked with a gleeful, almost maniacal abandon, and so there are some who may suspect that I will do so here. But this is an entirely different case, for World War Z's fault is not that it's a bad book. It's well-written, it's got an intriguing conceit (the tale of the zombie apocalypse told in journalistic hindsight from the perspective of those who survived), and some imaginative scenarios (sure, we've all thought about zombies on land, but what about zombies underwater?). In fact there's no fault at all here other than the fact that, as far as undead ghouls go, I'm Team Vampire. I've never really found anything that frightening about zombies, other than a certain \"Eww\" factor that compels me to think about how I need to stock up on hand sanitizer and wet wipes in a zombiefied world because they're leaving nasty bits and pieces everywhere. To me, there is nothing more frightening than intellect coupled with either undeniable evil or with moral apathy. Since zombies are basically husks driven by a biological imperative instead of conscious thought, they're not my monster of choice. The only zombie flicks I've enjoyed have been Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland. Humor + zombies = a win. Horror + zombies = not so much.So I knew going in that this was likely a swing and a miss, but it had received such rave reviews that I couldn't resist. I thought the journalistic style might appeal to me, but few of the voices were clearly differentiated enough for me to connect with any one character. There were 3 or 4 stories that really engaged me, but not enough to enjoy the overall experience. What was really frightening, however, is that Brooks does an excellent job of showing how ill-equipped we are globally to deal with any type of rapidly-spreading contagion. He also captures the fear and panic that comes out of facing an unknown. Particularly in first world countries, we are so complacent with \"knowing all the answers\" and controlling everything that the mental toll of facing a problem we can not solve would be just as damaging as the physical threat. Brooks does an excellent job of realistically portraying this.So, I'll say it again: not a bad book. Just not for me. Now I'll go sit in my corner and wait for someone else to catch biblio-cooties. It shouldn't be long. I just have to wait for someone to write a 1 star review of an Orson Scott Card or Janet Evanovich book and my transgressions will be forgotten.

Here, we get Bola\u00f1o-style interviews with key political and military figures from across the globe who are involved in the conflict, along with individual accounts of those who have survived the epidemic.

You don't stay with a narrative voice very long; each one speaks to the 'interviewer', telling their experience of the global plague, and then moves on.

Like after any great tragedy, the government wants a record. Max Brooks is their oral historian.  Only, when he hands his documents, the bureaucracy  whittles it down to the bare facts. Humans, over every nation,  dragged their bone weary bodies through this war. They are now faced with the numbing task of rebuilding society. They deserve to have their stories told.  So, he publishes the true account of World War Z.Told in a series of vignettes, we listen in on interviews as Brooks travels both the country and the world. He weaves a chilling tale.  \nThe monsters that rose from the dead, they are nothing compared to the ones we carry in our hearts\nThe vignettes are absolutely riveting. There's a bit of the regular zombie murder mayhem but the story focuses on the human side of things. How the survivors, survived.  There's the blind man who fought off a hoard with no more than a blunt staff. Some people lost their minds - succumbing to tree belief  that they have joined the dead. There's the unintentionally cannibalistic family - and so much more. \nMost people don't believe something can happen until it already has.\nAudiobook comments:--Read by Max Brooks, Alan Alda, John Turturro, Rob Reiner, Mark Hamill, Alfred Molina, Simon Pegg, Henry Rollins and Martin Scorsese--Highly recommended you listen to this novel - it's a quality production. --Every voice is country-specific and the actors read very convincingly.

Good job Simon :)There's not a plot persay really, its a bunch of survior accounts with a couple intersecting that follows the war from beginning to end. Some of the parts were overlong and a bit dry/rambling but it didn't deter my enjoyment of the novel. It's a book where you'll love it, or find it 'meh' probably... not a quick read but worth your time:)I remember having fun tracking down the unabridged version of the audiobook at the time. I didn't know at first only an abridged one was out (thosr make no sense to me ).. I think I found mine either just after I saw the movie or before.

I love the documentary format. Brooks did so well in telling it in such a way that it really did feel like non-fiction.One of my favorite parts of the zombie genre is not necessarily the horror and gore, but how the survivors deal with the threat and rebuilding. The before, during, and after stories in this book are raw and real. Because of this, this zombie tale will likely appeal to more than just horror fans.Concerning the movie: I enjoyed the movie, but it is barely like the book. They are each enjoyable in their own right. Max Brooks: Probably the most entertaining fact about this book is that it is written by Mel Brooks' son (but don't expect any comedy!)"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt", "userReview": "Zombie stories have been told in many different ways and teach us many different things. Some zombies are slow and teach us about the dangers of mass consumerism. Some zombies are fast and teach us about the dangers of infectious diseases. Sometimes the zombies take the backseat to a small group of unlikeable zombie-infestation survivors who sit around bickering, making poor decisions, and having circular, intro-level philosophical arguments until you are praying that the undead will rip their tongues from their still moving mouths. In this latter scenario, I am of course referring to the television version of The Walking Dead. Max Brooks\u2019 World War Z is different from anything you\u2019ve seen or read before. I\u2019m fairly certain about that. This is because Brooks has taken as his inspiration not George Romero or Robert Kirkman, but Studs Terkel. That\u2019s right, Studs Terkel: the famous, Pulitzer Prize winning oral historian.Terkel\u2019s The Good War and Hard Times, his most famous works, are not traditional nonfiction narratives. Rather, they are oral histories that collect the stories of a vast web of people, all with differing points of view. Each of these individuals tells their own story, a small part of the whole, in the first person, using their own words. Terkel would introduce the different stories with a dateline and a short, indented paragraph that explained a little bit about the each person. Then, he would stand back and let that person have their say. This is the exact template that Brooks (acknowledging his homage) uses in World War Z. And I think that\u2019s important for would-be readers to know. This isn\u2019t your typical zombie novel. It\u2019s not your typical novel at all. It has embraced the oral history conceit and plays that out to the end. In the world of World War Z, ten years have passed since the zombie apocalypse. The UN has decided to compile a report on the conflict, with Brooks playing the role of investigator. The official UN report relies heavily on facts and figures. Accordingly, Brooks decides to publish the personal stories \u2013 a collection of anecdotes \u2013 separately, in order to give readers a sense of how the Zombiegeddon felt. World War Z has eight chapters, not including an introduction, and within each of those chapters is a half-dozen or more remembrances from people around the globe. These chapters go in chronological order, so that the first chapter retells the outbreak of the zombie virus, while the final chapter covers the mopping up. In between there is a whole lot of blunt force trauma. The marvel of this book is the scope of its imagination. Conceptually, it is brilliant. Max Brooks has created a gritty, fully-realized, epic-sized scenario for the end of the world. And what\u2019s more, he seems to have taken a giddy delight in doing so. Jumping from character to character, we \u201clearn\u201d how the disaster started and spread, and how countries as different as China and Israel dealt with it. Other witnesses describe the difficulty in fighting the zombies, and Brooks goes technology-geek as he rattles off made-up weapons systems (mixed in with actual weapons systems) used to combat the undead: No one thought about how many rounds the artillery would need for sustained operations, how many rockets for the MLRS, how many canister shots\u2026the tanks had these things called canister shots\u2026basically a giant shotgun shell. They fired these little tungsten balls\u2026not perfect you know, wasting like a hundred balls for every G, but f\u2014k, dude, at least it was something! Each Abrams only had three, three! Three out of a total loadout of forty! The rest were standard HEAT or SABOT! Do you know what a \u201cSilver Bullet,\u201d an armor-piercing, depleted-uranium dart is going to do to a group of walking corpses? Nothing!Brooks\u2019 previous zombie-related book, The Zombie Survival Guide, was a tongue-in-cheek, hipster must-have. World War Z has had its tongue ripped from its cheek. It is grim, as in, Zombie War veterans suffering from PTSD grim. It paints a bleak picture of a shrinking number of defenders facing overwhelming odds. Brooks\u2019 zombies are old school. They are the slow and shuffling pre-28 Days Later undead. Even so, Brooks clearly outlines what makes them such an unstoppable force. He makes you imagine an enemy in the hundreds of millions, that doesn\u2019t get rattled, doesn\u2019t get scared, and doesn\u2019t stop, ever. And he also forces you to imagine psyches of the survivors, who among other things, are forced to dole out hundreds of head injuries in order to survive. The reality in a book like this is that some of the stories are going to be better than others. It would go too far to say that World War Z maintains an absolutely consistent high level of quality throughout. I don\u2019t think it does. Some of the individual histories are awesome. Incredible. Some of them are good enough to be short stories, tracing fierce dramatic arcs. Others have the twists and turns of a Twilight Zone episode. Among the standouts: a girl and her family escape to the north, hoping the cold will save them, but soon realize that despite preparations, they don\u2019t have enough supplies (doomsday preppers take note); a downed pilot must make her way to safety through zombie-infested territory, with only the radio guidance of a Skywatcher to help her through; a Chinese nuclear submarine goes rogue and discovers an ocean filled with sea-zombies. It is to Brooks\u2019 credit that he strives for a breadth and diversity of experiences. There is a chapter devoted solely to the United States, but he gives more than ample time to zombie survivors from all corners of the globe. One of the problems I had with this book, though, is despite these diverse characters, the narrative voices all sound the same. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are a Chinese doctor, an Indian engineer, a wild child who allegedly can barely speak, or an American soldier. All the narrators express themselves in the same way. The only difference is that some people use more jargon and slang than others. Thus, it was really hard to differentiate each person, except on the basis of how cool or memorable their encounters were. This lead to me not really caring about anyone on a human level. All these characters were nothing more than names and a means to execute a concept. Moreover, by utilizing the conceit of an oral history, Brooks removed the direct threat of the zombies. All these stories happened in the past, some as long as a decade ago. There is no longer any danger. You know that the storyteller has survived. Sure, lots of people died, but no one that the reader knows about, cares about, or can relate to. There are dozens of times when an oral historian sighs heavily, reaches for a smoke, and commiserates about their losses, but these are just words that ring hollow. Despite this, Brooks has succeeded masterfully at envisioning a nearly-ended world. I am a fan (I admit, guiltily) of apocalyptic fiction, from On the Beach to The Last Ship to The Road. Most end-of-the-world lit strives for realism in describing the destruction of society and the nascent civilization left struggling in doom\u2019s wake. All these books seek to teach you a lesson by evoking the mortal dread of abandoned automobiles, burnt-out cities, and unburied corpses. World War Z is as successful as any other novel I\u2019ve read in fulfilling the requirements of apocalyptic fiction. Of all the things there are to fear in the world, zombies do not rate very high. And of all the things that might end our world, I fear zombies less than killer bees, and slightly more than killer dolphins. Still, Brooks has done such an incredible job visualizing the fictional results of a zombie horde that part of me felt it was all quite possible."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "6.0 Stars. One of my All Time Favorites.

Pakistan (which has nuclear weapons in real life) nukes Iran right back, and both nations wipe each other out of existence. Israel, on the other hand, is shown to be as almost fantastically benevolent and humane - in the novel only Israel knows how to protect itself from the plague by erecting proper fortifications along its borders, and not only doesn't nuke any other nation (which is ironic, considering the fact that it's the only nation in the Middle East which actually has the capabilities to do so) but also takes in all Arab refugees who have a clean bill of health (not zombified). Technically they had to be Palestinian, but nobody really checked. The two sides kiss and make up for past conflicts, and go on to form a new country called \"United Palestine\" (Wonder if Brooks remembers the name of the Israeli PM who said that there was no such thing as Palestinians). This turn of events jumps out of the blue in a book which clearly aims to mimic real accounts, but it uncannily resembles actual relationships between the U.S. and both nations - the long-lasting and extremely generous support and approval of Israel and its actions, and the demonization and vilification of Iran - it being included by president Bush as one of the three countries in the Axis of Evil, and with the Obama administration making remarks about their \"deep commitment\" to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, which includes possible U.S. military action. Perhaps it's just me, but this makes me shiver and remember all the fearmongering of the early 2000's which was based on Saddam supposedly having nuclear weapons in Iraq, and the subsequent invasion of said country. Remember how well that went?There's more of this kind of perspective: Cuba is OK because it turns democratic and Castro votes himself out of power, and becomes the world's most vibrant economy. China also becomes democratic and gives total independence to Tibet, which becomes the world's most populated city. Not all nations are so lucky. The Saudis burn their oil fields (???), and there's no grand Korean reunification party - North Koreans disappear from the face of the planet, and it's suggested that they might have gone underground to pursue more communism with their Dear Leader. Russia is actually called \"Ivan\" by some of the characters, and this kind of sympathy prevails for the country - Brooks has it establish a theocracy at the end of the book, and start annexing the former Soviet territories in an attempt to restart an Empire. The Russians also turn their women into walking incubators - it's implied that they're killed after they can't breed anymore. Interestingly, not a word is said about all the crazy religious zealots from the Bible Belt, and such a scenario is particularly interesting to read when American conservative politicians push for restricting abortion, access to contraceptives and even sexual education in their country.
