A great chilling romantic suspense, and an author to watch. Edge of Midnight is for romance fans who like their stories with a good dose of nail biting suspense, a strong emotionally charged romance between the H/h, and a great deal of attention to the details. Crime reporter Mia Hale escaped the evil hands of a serial killer, but she has no memory of what happened. Special agent Eric Macfarlane with the FBI enlists her help to find the man that is kidnapping and torturing women before dumping their dead bodies. This is the kind of story that just sucks you in as you try to figure out what happened to Mia, what will she remember, and how are they ever going to find enough clues to bring down the serial killer? Nail biting stuff! The story spends a lot of time piecing together the evidence as well as building a profile for the killer. We also learn that Eric has deep personal ties to the serial killer, and that Mia\u2019s abduction may not have been random at all. Edge of Midnight was a great balance of romance and suspense. Eric and Mia\u2019s attraction and eventual relationship was well blended into the suspense part of the story. This is the best kind of romance suspense (IMHO). It is a multilayer story where more and more stuff gets revealed as we read on, has a believable romance with passion and steam, plus a great ending that wasn\u2019t overly predictable. I read this one out of order, and had no problem what so ever. This is a great author, I can't wait to read what she writes next.

She is also the only one to escape his clutches, but much to the chagrin of law enforcement, has no memory of her abduction. FBI profiler, Eric MacFarlane, has personal reasons for wanting to capture The Collector and knows that Mia is the key. As the two work together and the killer sets his sights on Mia once again, Eric swears to protect her even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice. Series note: None of the characters in the Chasing evil trilogy are connected and each of the books can be read as standalones. An intense psychological thriller with likable characters and a satisfying romance. Eric and Mia are both well-developed characters with interesting backstories that contribute to understanding both Eric's obsession with The Collector and Mia's determination with contributing to the investigation. Eric and Mia have solid chemistry and their romance is more believable than in the first two installments, although like Tentler's other stories in the series, the heroine is more emotionally attached than the hero. In terms of the mystery, the villain is exceedingly brutal and sadistic. His identity is revealed early on and readers are given his POV, which ratchets up the tension and suspense without undermining the procedural elements. There are one or two moments that require a healthy suspension of disbelief, but these do not minimize the overall effect of the mystery or the romance. In sum, a well-written and exciting story with just the right mix of action, suspense and romance."}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1815328-yvonne", "userReview": "This was one CREEPY but terrific read.

I enjoyed all of them, so by the time I read the third one, it was a strong \"5\" star read for me. I enjoyed the main characters, Mia Hale and Eric McFarlane, and loved seeing their relationship develop. Both Mia and Eric carried plenty of baggage, but it was wonderful watching them turn to one another and to overcome their painful pasts. The storyline was compelling and made it difficultl to put the book down. Mia Hale comes to consciousness behind the wheel of a wrecked vehicle, not knowing how she got there. She has obviously been tortured and mutilated. She's not the only victim of late, but she is the only one who has survived. It soon becomes clear that Mia was abducted from the parking garage of the building where she works as a crime reporter. The serial killer known as \"The Collector\" seems to be behind her abduction. Eric Macfarlane travels to Florida to work the case. This FBI agent suffered a tragic personal loss to \"The Collector\" and is determined to catch him. As Eric works with Mia to try to help her recover her memory of the abduction and subsequent captivity, they feel an attraction that soon develops into more. As they try to determine the identity of \"The Collector,\" they both face danger, and must decide if there is a possibility of a relationship between them if they both survive. This was a great romantic suspense. The characters and storyline came together to make an enjoyable book. The main characters were very likeable, and it was easy to feel empathy for them. The story was fast paced and kept me interested from beginning to end. I am very much looking forward to Tentler's next releasse.\""}, {"userName": "Anita", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1204702-anita", "userReview": "Another great book by Leslie Tentler. I didn't want to put it down. Mia is a news reporter who becomes the story. She was kidnapped, tortured and somehow able to escape a serial killer dubbed The Collector. Eric is a FBI agent with the VCU, he's called in by his friend and fellow agent Cam. Cam knows Eric's past and that Eric has spent years trying to hunt down the serial killer. It's a personal mission for him to stop the killer before he kills anymore women. Mia doesn't realize that she has ties to the serial killer that go back to when she was a young girl. Mia is one tough cookie. From her terrible childhood to being stalked by a serial killer, she sure keeps it together. I don't think that I would hold it together like she does.

Unfortunately for Mia, her interest in the disappearances has put her firmly in the sights of a sadistic killer who takes her, thinking to add her to his gruesome collection.When Mia is found wounded and disoriented on a beach in Jacksonville, it becomes evident that not only had she been taken by the serial killer dubbed The Collector, but that she is the first woman ever to escape from his clutches.When FBI agent Eric MacFarlane discovers that The Collector has come out of hiding and is once again taking and mutilating women, he knows that Mia Hale is the key to the case. Unfortunately, Mia has been left with no memory of her captivity, and outside of the physical scars of the torture she endured, it appears there is nothing she can do to help law enforcement.Eric has a very personal history with The Collector, however, and isn't about to let a little amnesia stand between him and what could be the only break the case has ever had. Strong-arming Mia into doing whatever is necessary to recover her memory, Eric soon finds himself struggling between his determination to stop The Collector and protecting the fiery woman who holds the key to his capture.But The Collector isn't finished with the tough and determined Mia Hale, and it soon becomes very clear that Mia is to be the pinnacle of his collection, and Eric and Mia both find themselves firmly in the sights of a brutal and sadistic killer..Overall, this was an exciting, terrifying read. The Collector was one of the scariest fictional serial killers I've read about, and the pacing was absolutely perfect. Adding in Mia's amnesia and the slow recovery of her memories, as well as Eric's connection to The Collector added a wonderful amount of tension to the story, and several unexpected twists and turns kept me on my toes for the entire read.I also loved the way that Mia and Eric's relationship developed, with both the pacing of their physical relationship ,and the unexpected emotions developing along the way.Recommended for fans of brutally terrifying serial killers, of survivors refusing to be kept down, and of sexy FBI agents battling between catching a killer and protecting the woman they're falling for.A scary 5/5 Stars."}, {"userName": "Manda Collins", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/901036-manda-collins", "userReview": "Another pulse pounding romantic suspense from Tentler, who is proving herself to be a solid author of FBI procedurals mixed with tender romance. We first meet heroine Mia Hale when she's just made her escape from The Collector, a serial killer who has relocated from the DC area to Jacksonville, Florida. A journalist, Mia had been working on a story about two missing women in the Jacksonville area before she went missing herself. As the first of the Collector's victims to escape alive, she has valuable information, only it's locked in her memory banks. FBI agent Eric MacFarlane lost his wife to The Collector three years ago. And now that the killer has resurfaced in Jacksonville he wants to be there to catch the guy. One of the most compelling aspects of this tale was the experimental treatments Mia underwent to retrieve her lost memories. So was the way that her own life and The Collector's had intersected in the past. The connection between Mia and Eric was made more poignant by the fact that they both were desperately in need of comfort. Mia because of her ordeal with the killer, and Eric because of the loss of his wife. Eric's need to keep Mia safe was realistic, and the fact that ultimately he too was a target for the killer balanced well with Mia's role of damsel in distress. And though she did need protection, there was never any question that she was tough enough to take care of herself if necessary. If you like sexy, suspensful romantic thrillers in the vein of Karen Rose, Mariah Stewart, or Cynthia Eden, you'll like Leslie Tentler's latest.  Slightly reminiscent of Mariah Stewart's FBI stories, only sexier."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7513972-victoria", "userReview": "Come to me, little girl. You won\u2019t cheat your destiny again.\n4.25 CREEPY STARS! I was looking at GR recommendations for romantic suspense books and came across Edge of Midnight. I haven't read the other books in this series so not sure if they are related or not but Edge of Midnight seems to stand on its own just fine. It's actually one of the better romantic suspense/thriller books I've read lately. The villian is CREEPY and some of the details in the book are grisly. There is definitely a romance but the book isn't sexually explicit. I thought the author did a good job of balancing the suspense story with the romance that develops between the two main characters. I also thought the multiple POV worked well (the heroine, the hero, and the villian). While Edge of Midnight had less heat than Cynthia Eden's Deadly series, it definitely had a similiar vibe to me. Overall, I really enjoyed Edge of Midnight and plan to read other books in this series very soon. I love finding a new author that \"gets it right\" and for me, this author did.

As a member of the FBI's Violent Crimes Unit, he was trained to hunt serial killers, but nothing could have prepared him for his wife Rebecca becoming the sadistic monster's fifth victim. The Collector slipped through his fingers, making Rebecca his final confirmed kill...an obscene retribution for which Eric still pays.The Collector disappeared, and no victims have turned up that match his MO. Then Eric gets a call from his old partner and friend in Jacksonville, Florida. He tells Eric a chilling tale of a young woman, crime reporter Mia Hale, who had been found near the beach after fleeing an accident scene.The woman had been nearly naked and drugged out of her mind. She showed signs of being restrained and tortured, and was covered in blood. Not all of it was hers. On her stomach someone had carved a number that is horrifyingly similar to numbers that Eric still sees in his darkest nightmares, that he saw on his own wife. But the one desecrating Mia's skin isn't the number five that had marked Rebecca's place in a psychopath's sick roll call. It's eight.The Collector is back. And he's been a busy man.Mia is the only victim to have escaped The Collector, but what she knows about the killer is locked away by the drug-induced retrograde amnesia she's suffering. Desperate to bring the monster down, Eric will do anything, push any angle, to get at the information that Mia has locked in her mind. Even if it puts her at risk. This is the one case that Eric can't let go...the one that took everything from him three years ago. And Eric knows beyond doubt that the monster will never stop, never, unless he can catch him before he strikes again.~*~I've been a fan of Tentler since her first book, Midnight Caller, and looked forward with anticipation to each subsequent book in this very loosely connected (as in not really at all) trilogy. Unfortunately, this one didn't work for me, a fact that I find frustrating, because by all rights, it should have. It's an intense psychological thriller, my favorite sort of romantic suspense. Neither the storyline nor the characters suffered any significant attack of the Ills and Imps. And Tentler can certainly write taut, horrific scenes that are gripping. All of those are big positives, and yet this one just fell short for me despite them all.The main characters, Eric and Mia, were well developed and three dimensional. Their lives were filled in nicely with depth in their backstory and connections to friends, co-workers, and family. On top of that, I enjoyed them in their roles. I thought Eric's history with The Collector added quite a bit of gravitas to his situation, and the combination of Mia's professional experience and her memory loss melded together well to not only explain her lack of significant trauma from her experience, but forgive her determination to investigate the killer. Without that, she would have annoyed me senseless.Unfortunately, despite Tenter's skill, I just didn't feel any sexual chemistry between them and the romance elements of the story failed to mesh for me because of it. I couldn't help but feel like they were being forced into their relationship instead of it being an organic extension of genuine attraction and increased sentiment. That's not to say that they didn't have some great scenes together, scenes filled with tension and intensity, but I just didn't buy their romantic relationship like I did for the romantic pairings in Tentler's first two books.I also had an issue with a couple of story elements related to The Collector. We know from the beginning that this is one seriously screwed up, very bad man, sadistic and brutal. Had my view of him been limited to his crimes and his psychopathy, he would have been a powerful force of terror in the book. Unfortunately, parts of the narrative written from his perspective identified him and showed his relationship with his mother.Instead of furthering a character study of a cold-blooded monster, he came off as weak and ineffectual in those scenes, a misogynist with Mommy issues. While it explained why he was who he was and how he became what he became, it robbed The Collector of his scary as all hell mojo and lent a pathetic air to his persona that did him an injustice in the book. I wouldn't have minded learning those things about The Collector in hindsight, but being peppered with it sporadically throughout the book had a negative impact.I thought, too, that the storyline stretched a bit close towards unbelievable coincidence when connections between The Collector and Mia started to be woven into the story. I wish that had been left out of the narrative, because it didn't really work for me and it seemed a bit too far out there to be realistically plausible. It served no purpose beyond displaying an even sharper gradient of evil, and by the time the chips fell and the truth was known, it had become tragic but largely superfluous.All of the issues I had are obviously quite subjective, and none of them take away from the fact that the book is well told, the characters are well written, and the crimes are well and truly grotesque. For me it just wasn't quite the powerhouse I was hoping for or expecting after the first two books in the series, especially the second one, Midnight Fear. It was okay, though, and I hope to have the pleasure of more from Tentler in the future.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Mira Books publisher Harlequin via NetGalley.

Both fierce and fragile, Mia grew up being tossed between the foster care system and her unstable mother. She is a survivor and has risen above her circumstances by creating a solid life for herself. However, that is all about to change. When she doesn\u2019t arrive at work one morning, her editor reports her missing. She is found hiding on the beach by two police officers after they discover an abandoned stolen vehicle nearby \u2013 Mia is alive but badly battered and bloody.On closer medical examination it is discovered that she has no memory of how she got there, why she was abducted or who the perpetrator was, due to a potent mixture of drugs found in her blood system.FBI Special Agent Eric Macfarlane, based in Washington with the FBI\u2019s Violent Crimes Unit is drawn into the case when a close friend of his calls him in to assist in the investigation. On reading a copy of the detailed incident report from the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Department, the similarities to another case close to his heart chill his blood - the wounds inflicted on the victim are not the work of an ordinary killer. With this playing on his mind, Eric immediately heads to Jacksonville in pursuit of a suspected killer whose modus operandi bears the same horrendous resemblance to \u201cThe Collector\u201d, a sadistic serial killer who appears to have resumed his grim hobby of abducting women and taking gruesome souvenirs before dumping their bodies.The question is - why is Mia still alive? None of \u201cThe Collector\u2019s\u201d victims has ever managed to escape.Both Eric and Mia are drawn into the investigation, with Mia risking everything to regain her memory. As the body count continues to rise Eric, who has been in self-imposed exile for the last 3 years, is torn between his feelings of guilt for the past, which is beyond his control, and his deepening feelings for Mia.With absolutely no clues or DNA left at any of the crime scenes, the FBI is at a loose end, but a cleverly constructed press conference sends the killer into a frenzy \u2013 exactly the reaction the FBI was hoping for.A psychological pathology begins to emerge when the killer is identified. Quite obviously having a dysfunctional relationship with women, Eric has an aggressively narcissistic psychopath on his hands who revels in the false sense of power he has over his victims. What follows is a riveting, nail-biting build-up to a climax fraught with danger and fresh fear. The perverse pleasure \"The Collector\" gains whilst putting his final two victims through hellish torture is graphic.I seem to have been on a bit of a serial killer \u201cspree\u201d with the books that I have chosen lately but let me just say that I found this novel emotionally gripping with both characters pulling at my heartstrings - Eric so much that I just wanted to crawl into his arms and never leave.Leslie Tentler has a really smooth prose style and has found a perfect balance between suspense, danger and romance. I am also in absolute awe of any author who is able to give such depth of emotion to their characters - Leslie is one of those and I am so pleased to have discovered her.This is her third book in the Chasing Evil Trilogy. Her first, Midnight Caller, was released in February 2011 and the second, Midnight Fear, close on its heels in August 2011.I highly recommend this read which has been written by a refreshing new author to the romantic suspense scene."}, {"userName": "Lyn (Readinghearts)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2124637-lyn-readinghearts", "userReview": "Early last year, the first book in the Chasing Evil trilogy, Midnight Caller was recommended to me. I read that book and instantly grew enamored of the author's writing. While these books are probably classed as Romantic Mysteries, and romance books are not my normal preference, Leslie Tentler's books are a cut above. Edge of Midnight is another winner for the author, who writes like she has been established in this field for a while. What I particularly like about Leslie's books is that the romance takes a back seat to the mystery plot. And the mystery plots are right up there with the best. In Edge of Midnight, we meet Eric McFarlane, an agent with the FBI's Violent Crime Unit. Eric has been called to Florida to investigate the case of a serial killer who he has run up against in the past. But as in all good mysteries, there is more to the story than at first meets the eye. This book had me staying up late turning pages just to see where the story would take me. I kept thinking, one more chapter and I will quit, but would keep reading anyway. That is always a good sign with a mystery book. My only caveat about the books is that they are considered a trilogy. I kept waiting for the three stories to tie together somehow. In fact, they are only loosely related, but that is really not a negative as they all stand very well on their own. I hope that Ms. Tentler will continue to write mysteries like these as I will certainly be on board to read them."}, {"userName": "D.B.

The only difference between Mia and his previous victims is that somehow she escaped. The problem is she remembers nothing of her kidnapping and torture, or even how she got away. On the one hand, she's desperate to remember in order to help the FBI and the police track the killer down before he kills anyone else.

I enjoyed Tentler's serial killer and Tentler's depiction of his family and life. The reader is able to see the factors that helped create Allen into the Collector. I see the Collector as an individual very similar to Casanova from Jame's Patterson's Kiss the Girls, though I appreciated that Tentler's Collector was more about about power, control, and not about sex. I think that Tentler did a great job of allowing the reader to see glimpses into the torture that the Collector inflicted on his victims but not too much that people would be disturbed. The main form of description comes through Mia as well as the state of the bodies when they are discovered.The main interesting topic within this novel is the use of drugs in order to induce hypnotherapy to recover lost memories. I think that this is unique in books that I have read and the could very well be something that the military is trying to accomplish. I liked that Tentler was not afraid of adding something new to the genre and trying a new way of using a victim to uncover clues that could lead to the killer.There was a little bit too much romance/sex scenes for my taste in books, but those who enjoy the combination of some thrills and romance will enjoy this book. I also found the interaction between the two main characters a little bit of a cliche now of days, FBI agent and victim falling in love is nothing new in these novels. There was also nothing very original about the main characters themselves that drew me in or get me emotionally invested as to what happens to them and this may be the flaw of writing a stand alone story. But for me the characters were just there interacting with the plot. I often find that authors will shelter their main characters too much and it leaves the story feeling flat. However, this is one aspect of Tentler's characters that I did enjoy was that she was not afraid of letting them suffer or get hurt.Although there was a bit too much romance in this book for me and I was not able to connect to the characters as mush as I would like, I did enjoy the overall story of the book (and really it is easy to skim or skip over the sex scenes). I think that Tentler has a create mind and it shows in her ideas throughout the story. I think those who like their Thrills and Romance mixed together in a book will have a winner with Tentler. I would read another book by Tentler, probably from her Midnight series as I want to see what other type of serial killers that she has come up with as I think this is where she excelled the most within her novel.Enjoy!!!!"}, {"userName": "Noelle Pierce", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3757825-noelle-pierce", "userReview": "This final book in the Chasing Evil trilogy was even better than the first two, but induced some nightmares. No, wait. That's a good thing. I had to pull myself from the book a few times and remind myself that it was fiction. Leslie does an amazing job of describing the scenery and situations that it's easy to get swept into the investigation and the suspense over whether the good guys will figure out who the bad guy is before the next murder.That said, this book is much more gruesome than her first two. You are warned.I loved Mia's character and her background made her the perfect foil for both the murderer (she was the one that got away, after all) and for the hero. Her resilience and determination were admirable. The psychological explanations were strong enough to make me wonder if Leslie had a degree in psychology or criminology, and they all fit well.Unlike her first two books, the killer in this one is known to the reader, which is a welcome change to the suspense/romantic suspense genre. It's more realistic, because serial killers are rarely known to law enforcement, making it even harder to catch them. In this book, the race to catch the killer is just as exciting as in a book where the killer/criminal is unknown. There were maybe two or three minor issues I had with the story and/or writing. First, the romance fell secondary to the suspense. The scenes for sexual tension were downplayed more in this book than in the others. Another minor thing I noticed (because I'm a east-coast Florida native and this book took place in Jacksonville) was how Leslie phrased the titles of a few places and landmarks, which immediately told me that the author was not from the area. This isn't a deal-breaker, because I don't expect writers to only write stories that take place in their hometowns, and none of the errors were egregious. And let's face it: the hero wasn't from Jacksonville, either, so she can easily be forgiven those when in his point of view.The third thing might be a deal-breaker for some, but only from a personal standpoint. This book had multiple points-of-view, and not just the hero, heroine, and villain. Minor characters were given some scenes to tell the reader things they would not otherwise know. In addition, Leslie occasionally used an omniscient point of view, again to tell the reader something they would otherwise not know. In those cases, it worked well to heighten the tension.All in all, I would highly recommend this book for people who enjoy the genre, and don't mind the occasional gory details of a serial killer's sadistic tendencies. You won't be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Willa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36476570-willa", "userReview": "Romantic suspense is my genre of choice. I love a good mystery, following the clues, layered together with the romance. In a genre where Secret Ops, Black Ops, Undercover Ops seem to be prevalent at the moment, complete with three, four, five or more team members all waiting in the wings and queuing for their books, finding this standalone one was a real thrill.Mia Hale is found on a stretch of beach by two cops, having been kidnapped and tortured by a serial killer. Somehow she has managed to escape \u2013 the only problem is, due to a cocktail of drugs given to her by the killer, she remembers nothing about the events. The FBI is able to link her distinctive injuries to the serial killer known as The Collector. For the last three years he has been silent, but now he has appeared again.Eric MacFarlane works for the FBI \u2013 he worked on the first case when The Collector was active and was frustrated at not being able to bring the case to a close. This is heightened due to the killer taunting him with notes and taking and killing Eric\u2019s wife Rebecca as his last victim. When he hears that there has been a survivor to these brutal killings, he heads down to Florida.Mia is a reporter and had been working on cases of women who had recently gone missing \u2013 who they now realise are the victims of The Collector, as their bodies are slowly uncovered. She desperately wants to help the investigation along, so teams up with Eric to try to uncover her memories.The action and questions start right on the first page and drew me in. The pacing is lovely, a fab blend of slowly, tightening suspense that kept me saying \u201cjust one more chapter,\u201d attention to detail, and a believable romance are perfectly layered in. I love the fact that although both Mia and Eric had endured much in their pasts, they are both willing to acknowledge their attraction and slowly, hesitantly build on it. There isn\u2019t lots of self-torturing that goes on and on and on, but they aren\u2019t glib either. There are interesting secondary characters that add to the layers \u2013 Eric\u2019s old partner from the FBI, Cameron, happily married, so no overt sequel baiting, which I enjoyed too. And Ms. Tentler still manages to pop in a few twists and surprises along the way \u2013 which are always appreciated. A great read and Ms. Tentler is now on my must-buy list.This is listed as Book 3 in the Midnight Trilogy, but each book stands on its own. The only thing that connects them is that all the heroes work for the same FBI department.Comment Comment | Permalink"}, {"userName": "Scooper Speaks", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4267707-scooper-speaks", "userReview": "Favorite Line: \u201cHe began to squeeze, thrilling at the bob of her small Adam\u2019s apple under his thumbs.\u201d (p. 380, egalley)Edge of Midnight feels like an homage to the classic story Kiss the Girls written by James Patterson, but it has a definite romance angle. It feels like Patterson with a dash of Catherine Coulter. What you need to know: Edge of Midnight is a thrilling romantic suspense told in the third person and the final installment in Leslie Tentler\u2019s Chasing Evil trilogy. Through the \u201cwandering eye\u201d we see events unfold around both the hero and heroine, as well as the villain and his victims. This is one of those books which make you scream, \u201cdon\u2019t answer the door.\u201dThe Chasing Evil trilogy all revolve around serial killers, FBI men and female would-be victims. You\u2019ll meet three different types of killers and possibly love them all. I truly enjoyed book one, Midnight Caller, but I was bored with book two, Midnight Fear. I was sucked into the action and creep factor which make up Edge of Midnight immediately, so I\u2019m now two for three with Tentler\u2019s books. I see myself checking her out every time she releases a book.I know the story is a romance, but it is heavier on the suspense in my mind. This makes the story solid and adds depth. It avoids the instant love trap and allows a \u201crealistic\u201d love to build. Both the hero and heroine have been victimized and traumatized by the serial killer in the story. Neither is looking for love so it was fun to watch their friendship grow. Actually, to be brutally honest, the romance didn\u2019t catch my attention until the final quarter of the story. I was so focused on character\u2019s surviving the drama that I paid little notice to the tension building between the characters.When you need a book that will keep you on pins and needles, you need to hit the store and purchase Edge of Midnight. It\u2019s one of those books that can be read several times and despite being a romance should appeal to straight up suspense lovers. You\u2019re guaranteed a happy ending (Duh, romance.), but getting to the end is an adrenaline rush. I\u2019m glad I read it.Scooper Speaks"}, {"userName": "Books Mom", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7199227-books-mom", "userReview": "We hosted Leslie Tentler on our blog during her tour for this book, and I'll admit -- I'd never heard of her until that day. But I was intrigued by the blurb and decided to grab a copy of the book once I saw that she'd reassured our commenters that they didn't have to be read in order. I'm so glad I did (and SO very glad I discovered her -- I've since gotten the other two books in the series).Edge of Midnight features a truly deranged villain. You know, the kind that keeps you up at night or invades your nightmares when you sleep. He does terrible things to the women he kidnaps and murders and enjoys every bit of the torture he inflicts.Enter our tortured hero, Eric. His wife was one of the victims of The Collector, chosen specifically because she was married to him. Now, Eric is determined to find this serial killer no matter what he has to do.I loved that Eric had such deep feelings about everything. He didn't really shut himself off after his wife was murdered, though he certainly had reservations about ever getting involved again. Of course, when he met Mia, those reservations were tested.Mia is such a strong woman. She survives being taken by The Collector, and then undergoes so much in order to regain her memory so they might find him. She's the perfect foil to Eric. She did do a couple of things that might be considered TSTL (that's \"too stupid to live\"), but I still admired her.This was a book I didn't want to put down. I thought about it when I wasn't reading it, I made a point to find time to read even with my crazy busy schedule. I had to know how everything would work out. It was a perfect balance of nail-biting suspense and romantic love story. I highly recommend this story to all romantic suspense lovers out there.Ms. Tentler, I'm so glad I found you! I can't wait to dive into your other two books.Originally posted at http://its-raining-books.blogspot.com..."}], "description": "The writer becomes the story when crime reporter Mia Hale is discovered on a Jacksonville beach, bloodied and disoriented, but alive.
