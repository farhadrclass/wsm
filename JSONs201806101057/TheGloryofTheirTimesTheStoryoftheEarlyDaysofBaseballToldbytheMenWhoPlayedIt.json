I know there aren\u2019t that many people who give a shit about baseball but I have really grown to appreciate it. This book is a transcription of interviews with baseball players who played around the turn of the century. It was published in the 60\u2019s. The stories are great and I just have to wonder what happened to this sport. It was such in integral part of American culture (the little that exists) and it\u2019s really fallen by the wayside. It was mentioned in the book that the evolution of the ball itself really changed the sport. Fields used to be huge and the balls were heavy and hard to hit. There were some references to how the fans became more interested in seeing homers and high scoring games. The balls changed to accommodate. I tend to agree that this dramatically influenced the decline of the sport. Baseball has often been referred to as \u201cthe thinking man\u2019s sport\u201d. I couldn\u2019t agree more. There are so many subtleties and strategies that go unnoticed. I love the thinking aspect and almost all of the players interviewed talk about how you had to be smart and they were often penalized for not thinking on the field. Many of them were college educated and made little money as professional players. That\u2019s quite a difference by today\u2019s standards.I really appreciated this book and learned a lot. My favorite player interview is with Fred Snodgrass, it was funny and charming. I also learned about Jim Thorpe (http://www.cmgww.com/sports/thorpe/) and pretty much had my heart broken over it. I never knew anything about him until reading this book. Jim Thorpe was Native American. He was described as the greatest athlete of the 20th century having earned 2 gold medals in the 1912 Olympics. The King of Sweden presented him with an award declaring him \u201cthe greatest athlete that ever lived\u201d. He had his medals stripped from him the following year because he played two seasons of semi-pro baseball which made him ineligible in the eyes of the Olympic Committee. They took his medals back and removed his name from the record books. This is the part of the story that broke my heart: \"Jim was very proud of the great things he'd done. A very proud man....Very late one night Jim came in and woke me up. ... He was crying, and tears were rolling down his cheeks. `You know, Chief,' he said, `the King of Sweden gave me those trophies, he gave them to me. But they took them away from me. They're mine, Chief; I won them fair and square.' It broke his heart and he never really recovered.\"-- Chief Meyers, Thorpe's roommate and catcher for the New York GiantsI almost felt like I had to lead a crusade to have his medals restored but someone beat me to it. They were restored long after he died in 1982. He died of a heart attack, alone\u2026 in a trailer. Sigh. The least I can do is tell the story of his injustice."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2439621-barbara", "userReview": "My oh my,, I enjoyed this audiobook SO much!

Maybe 10. This is, hands down, the best baseball book I have ever read! It was absolutely delightful! The book is, if I understand correctly, interviews with ballplayers, transcribed from tapes which now reside in the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown. I had not heard of a lot of these players before, but now love them as much or more than the players I follow today. Players like Rube Marquard, Tommy Leach, Davy Jones, Sam Crawford, to name a few. I knew of Lefty O'Doul and Goose Goslin, Edd Roush, Hank Greenberg, and I think I had heard of Heinie Groh. Such great interviews! And oh, how different this great game was back in those days. Most of these players played around the turn of the 20th century. Many of them played for John McGraw's Giants. There were Pirates, Red Sox, Braves (Boston Braves), Cardinals, and even a few Yankees. I learned so much from this book. For example the greatest pitcher who ever pitched was Walter Johnson. Or Smokey Joe Wood. Or Christy Mathewson. The greatest hitter ever was Ty Cobb. Or Paul Waner. Or Babe Ruth. The best outfielder ever was Harry Hooper. Or...hopefully you get the picture. Of course, who was best is always relative, and each one of these players has a different idea of who was best. Walter Johnson was quoted as saying that not a man alive could pitch faster than Smokey Joe Wood. While many of the batters said that Walter Johnson had a fast ball that sometimes couldn't even be seen.I laughed. I cried. I made 26 new \"friends.\" And it made me love baseball all over again. (Not that I stopped, mind you...it just reminded me what a great and glorious game it is.) One very noticeable thing was that most of these guys talked more about other players than they did themselves. They stood up for people like Fred Merkle who was blamed for the Giants losing the 1908 pennant to the Cubs. They stood up for Fred Snodgrass who was blamed for losing the 1912 World Series. They talked about Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Honus Wagner, who, apparently truly was one of the greatest players to ever play the game. He's more than just a valuable baseball card. I could go on and on about this one. I intend to keep this book as long as I live and read it over and over again. Perhaps every time I get frustrated with today's crybabies, and every time baseball breaks my heart like it did in 2011, I'll pick this book up and fall in love with it all over again. If you are a baseball fan, read this book. If you're not, perhaps it will make you one."}, {"userName": "Steven Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson", "userReview": "This is a wonderful book, nostalgic but still powerful. The author tape recorded interviews with many old-time baseball players in the mod 1960s. He essential transcribed the recordings and published them in this book. The result is a first person narrative by many players from the very late 1800s through the 1940s. In a later edition, a handful of new interviews was included. The result is very interesting and even riveting.One way of addressing this is simply to note some of those interviewed--the greats and the not-so-great: Rube Marquard, Sam Crawford, Fred Snodgrass, Joe Wood, Babe Herman, Specs Toporcor, Goose Goslin, Hank Greenberg, and Paul Waner. Each gives his sense of their career, their times, and the game of baseball. Many of the comments are awfully insightful. The vignettes also provide a sense of what baseball was like in the very late 19th century and first half of the 20th century.For baseball fans, this classic is still well worth reading. . . ."}, {"userName": "Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7199941-campbell", "userReview": "A fascinating and, at times, moving account of the early days of baseball, told by the players themselves.

I've watched Ken Burns' Baseball probably a half-dozen times. As such, I'm the exact target audience for Lawrence S. Ritter's book, The Glory of Their Times: The Story Of The Early Days Of Baseball Told By The Men Who Played It. This book was absolutely fantastic, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with any interest at all in baseball. Even if you aren't currently interested in the game's history, you will be by the time you finish The Glory of Their Times.Originally published in 1966 including interviews with 22 players from the early 20th century, and expanded in 1984 with an additional four player interviews, Ritter sets out to capture the memories of the earliest players of the game for the ages, and does so brilliantly. The book consists of a chapter for each player interviewed, and Ritter lets the player tell their own story in their own way. It's absolutely fascinating to hear these players echoing through the decades and describing the way they played the game, their careers, their teammates, their managers, the business of baseball, and even the fans of the day as seen from the player's view.One of the aspects of the book that I enjoyed most is that many of the players discuss the same events or players, including each other, and it's great getting different takes on all of that. You'll hear all about what the players of the day, including his teammates, thought of Merkle's Boner, or what it was like to play with or against Ty Cobb, or what manager John McGraw was like to play for. By the time you finish the book, you'll feel like you've gotten to know all these other players just as well as the men interviewed, who range from Hall of Famers like Sam Crawford or Paul Waner to a career utility player like Specs Torporcer.Baseball fans who, like me, have enjoyed Ken Burns' Baseball documentary should read this book. In fact, I re-watched Baseball (once again) only a couple months before reading The Glory of Their Times, and I recognized many of the stories and quotes from the early episodes of Baseball as having come straight from these interviews. So, if you enjoyed those, there's a lot more like that here for you.Another part of the book that is well done is the inclusion of many, many photographs. Ritter gives the reader pictures of all the interviewees and many of the people they talk about, and the pictures are included in the text when relevant, instead of in a glossy insert in the middle of the book, so they're very effective in helping the reader visualize the events being described.I highly recommend The Glory of Their Times. It's a magnificent book that does a wondrous job of drawing the reader into the early days of baseball."}, {"userName": "Ivan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139641-ivan", "userReview": "I can't remember any of my 10th grade teachers.

They can remember stats, conversations, and crazy plays with such clarity and enthusiasm it'll make you wish Ritter had interviewed even more players. Reading these stories feels like sitting on your grandpa's knee while he regales you for hours. Not my grandpa, though, he's 90 and it would crush him.I would consider this book essential reading for anyone who loves baseball.

Listening to the old baseball greats talk about themselves and their fellow players gave me the chills. It's magical. Even though these players were grossly underpaid by today's standards, none of them are bitter about it and many say, even looking back, they would have played for free.

The author set out to find a handful of aged former baseball players, long forgotten yet residing somewhere in the country with balefuls of memories on the greatest sport of all time. Each chapter is essentially a different ballplayer from the early 20th century waxing poetic about different teammates, managers, and opponents. It was fascinating to hear their largely respectful testimony, but it was more surprising to read about many of the similarities they had with modern day ballplayers--contractual issues, struggles in their early big-league days, choices between playing and getting an education, and so on. Wonderful, and as an avid baseball fan myself, many of the names drummed up memories of when I was a kid studiously poring through all the old hall-of-famers' (et al) names and stats with reverence.

A total of 26 noteworthy ballplayers, most of whom began their professional careers before 1920, provided their oral history to this seldom-known writer in the early 1960s (though four interviews were not conducted until the 1984 edition), shortly after the death of the all-time great Ty Cobb. The real beauty of each autobiography is that Ritter didn\u2019t guide the \u201cinterview\u201d like a normal newspaper reporter would, as they likely would have demanded that these men - many of whom hadn\u2019t played the game of baseball for over 40 years, answer a set of specific questions until the writer was satisfied. No, Ritter was overly successful by first building a foundation of social and physiological comfortableness with each man, turning on the tape recorder and putting it out of eyesight, and simply letting his new friend talk about anything that came to mind. Consequently, the memories pour out onto the pages like a never-ending waterfall! This concept of the interviewee-led oral history was groundbreaking back then, and it helped save numerous memories of an early era in both baseball and American society before it was too late. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed Ritter\u2019s organization of all 26 interviews, as those interviewees who happened to be former teammates (or adversaries) and who commented on the same player or event were often put in consecutive chapters in the book. Though legendary figures such as Honus Wagner, Walter Johnson, and John McGraw were not interviewed by Ritter, they are as much a featured personality of this book as are the interviewees themselves. Any baseball enthusiast who wishes to learn more about the Dead Ball Era (and quite a bit of the Live Ball Era, too), how a professional ballplayer made his way through the ranks and what life was like in the major leagues, and who were the noteworthy AND forgotten ballplayers and coaches who made up these great times, look no further than \u201cThe Glory of Their Times\u201d!

He taught finance at New York University, but was an avid baseball fan too. During his vacations, he sought out and interviewed baseball players who had played in the major leagues during the early years of the 20th century. Originally, in 1966, Ritter published a version of GLORY featuring edited transcripts of his interviews. Then in 1998, working with Henry Thomas and Neal McCabe, Ritter published the audio book that I listened to. It consists of 5 hours of interviews recorded by Ritter between 1961 and 1966. These interviews are truly wonderful for any baseball fan. The original recordings now reside in Cooperstown and the University of Notre Dame.Though these interviews were not focused on the Chicago Cubs, they are relevant to the Cubs because they add new information concerning two events in baseball history that relate to the significance of the Cubs\u2019 2016 World Series Championship and its place in baseball history. I will limit this short review to those two events.The first was the infamous Merkle\u2019s Boner. Many of you probably know of this incident. Late in the 1908 season, the Cubs and the New York Giants were embroiled in a tight race for the National League pennant when the Giants hosted the Cubs at the Old Polo grounds in New York City. Fred Merkle, a rookie first baseman for the Giants, was making his first start ever in a major league baseball game. The teams had battled to a 1-1 tie when the Giants came up to bat in the bottom of the ninth. Art Devlin singled for the Giants. He was forced at second on a grounder by Moose McCormick. Merkle then singled McCormick to third. With two outs, Al Bridewell then hit an apparent single to centerfield scoring McCormick and winning the game for the Giants. But believing the game to be over and with the crowd spilling out into the field (as was customary at the Polo Grounds in those days), Merkle headed directly to the Giants\u2019 locker room which the players entered through a door in the outfield. The problem was he did not touch second base first. Noting Merkle\u2019s blunder, Cubs\u2019 second baseman Johnny Evers called for the ball and completed the force out at second. McCormick\u2019s run did not count and the game ended in a tie.I am leaving out a lot of details, but the call was highly controversial for a variety of reasons. (There are several competing versions that you can find online.) However, the league upheld the call and the result was that the regular season ended a few weeks later with the Cubs and Giants tied. The Cubs won the make up game and went on to win the 1908 World Series. But for that strange play, the 1908 Cubs championship would never have occurred. Fred Snodgrass, the Giants\u2019 centerfielder, defended Merkle when Ritter interviewed Snodgrass decades later. He explained that because the Polo Grounds crowd quickly swarmed the field upon the final play in those days, the players typically bolted for the locker room to beat the crowd. Merkle only did what the players had been doing all season, according to Snodgrass.Before the Cubs\u2019 miraculous come back victory in game 7 last year, many historians of baseball had considered the Red Sox comeback in the bottom of the 10th of game eight of the 1912 World Series to be the greatest in World Series history. (The Series went eight games that year because game 2 had ended in a tie after 11 innings.) GLORY provides a gripping account of the final half inning. With Christy Mathewson pitching, the Giants led the Sox 2 \u2013 1. Clyde Engle led off with an easy fly ball to (the aforementioned) Fred Snodgrass in centerfield. Inexplicably, the usually sure-handed Snodgrass muffed the ball putting Engle on second base. Harry Hooper then hit a screamer to center that Snodgrass made a fine running play on for the first out, but Engle was able to advance to third. Mathewson then walked Steve Yerkes. Another infamous play then followed. Tris Speaker hit a high pop fly down the first base line. The Giants\u2019 first baseman Fred (now known as \u201cBonehead\u201d) Merkle was closest, but Mathewson called for his catcher Chief Meyers to take it. Meyers was farther away than either Mathewson or Merkle and did not make the play. The ball fell foul. In GLORY, Meyers explained that Mathewson had called for Meyers to take it because Merkle \u201chad not been too steady\u201d. Legend has it that Speaker then yelled at Mathewson that he had made the wrong call and now \u201cwould pay for it\u201d. Speaker then singled Engle home, Yerkes advancing to third. Mathewson walked Duffy Lewis to set up a possible double play, but Larry Gardner hit a sacrifice fly to right field to score Yerkes. The Sox won the game and the series.I still like the end to the 2016 Series better, but 1912 sounds like a great one too. And isn\u2019t this game endlessly fascinating?"}, {"userName": "Robert Melnyk", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13278698-robert-melnyk", "userReview": "Fascinating book on the early history of baseball during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as told by some of the men who played the game.

Amazing stories - and really interesting how often different players tell versions of the same stories - by some amazing people (including at least a couple all-time greats like Sam Crawford and Rube Marquard).

I can't wait to be an old man talking about the glory days of baseball in the 90s."}, {"userName": "Mr. Suitts CHS", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14386979-mr-suitts-chs", "userReview": "The famous baseball announcer Red Barber wasn't kidding when he called this \"the best baseball book of all time.\" What I loved abut the book was how author Lawrence Ritter was able to get the retired players to tell him fascinating and often hilarious stories about their fellow ballplayers around the turn of the century. For instance, we hear about times hecklers lost their voice, times fans rushed the field, and, in one of my favorite stories, a time when manager John McGraw fined one of his players for hitting a home run. Ritter writes the book by putting together the players answers to his questions to form an oral history (he doesn't list his questions), making the book flow easily from one story to the next. If you are a baseball fan, you owe it to yourself to check this book out."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/615872-michael", "userReview": "I won't begin this review by referring to The Glory of Their Times as an astounding oral history of baseball in the early 20th Century. It's the stories and the minds of the men who played that are so compelling; for example, hall-of-famer Sam Crawford's insight into the number of misfit characters he played alongside and against, like Rube Waddell, who'd kill several pints before hopping over the centerfield fence and walking to the mound. Crawford marvels over a time when people in general were individuals, not conformists molded by newspaper and television. This book will erase whatever cliches you associate with the very idea of a \"national pasttime,\" and inject it with images of boys riding horse-driven wagons through the Midwest to play against their small-town-American peers."}, {"userName": "Sal Crano", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8004592-sal-crano", "userReview": "Reading this is like having your grandpa telling you about how great the old days were. Having him tell you about playing with Cy Young, Honus Wagner, or how big a jerk Ty Cobb was.A buddy of mine tipped me off that you can find cds of the actual interviews with the ballplayers. It's sooooo fun and interesting listening to them.  But it's mors than just baseball. The ballplayers' stories about traveling to find work, living on a train, and struggling to survive are fascinating. Charles \"Victory\" Faust by himself makes this book worth reading. This book is a treasure, even if you're not a baseball lover."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3872023-jim", "userReview": "The Glory of Their Times is a great book for any baseball fan. It contains the stories of 26 of the greats of the game from the first half of the twentieth century, as they remember them. The book is filled with tales of triumph and tragedy and memories that span the range of human emotion. The astounding feats,amazing careers and humorous anecdotes are too numerous to list. Every players' story is unique, but they are all united by their love for the game of baseball. I encourage all enthusiasts (spectators or participants) of our national pastime to read this book. It turns old black and white photos into brilliantly colored, fluid scenes played by very real, very talented men."}, {"userName": "Marc Shoemaker", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10151360-marc-shoemaker", "userReview": "No surprise that this book has one of the highest average ratings of any book on my shelf; it is the absolute standard. I first read this when I was in junior high in the seventies. I was fascinated by these firsthand tales of the early days of the game that had become a large part of my life. A couple of years ago I picked it up again, and it didn't disappoint. One of the more interesting bits to me this time around was how players had conflicting opinions as to whether today's players (or rather the players of the late sixties, when the book was written) were better than they were. Then there's the story of Germany Schaefer stealing first base...from second."}], "description": "Baseball was different in earlier days\u2014tougher, rawer, more intimate\u2014when giants like Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb ran the bases.
