Amish books are so widely popular, and this is the perfect series for introducing children to this cultural phenomenon. I was privileged to read the first book, but I somehow missed the second book. As outstanding as the first book was, this book is even better! I was thoroughly engaged, and I often lost track of time as I raced through the pages.At times I felt that I was reading \"Little House on the Prairie\" Amish-style. I took great delight in that series as a child, and this book is so similar and yet stands on its own. This book works well for the third book in the series, but it is also a stand-alone book. The characters appear to be authentic, and I appreciate the history and cultural lessons that are taught within this book. I found myself so engrossed, and the humor in the book was often laugh-out-loud funny. My only criticism is that I wish that the faith of these people was emphasized and explained in a more concrete way. In short, if you have a child who wants to learn about the Amish culture, this is a perfect series to do just that. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Oh, and adults will love it, too! I sure did!I was sent a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. I was not financially compensated, and all opinions are 100 percent mine."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18427573-rachel", "userReview": "As a continuation of the Lily series, this book continues the process of adjusting to the changes in Lily's community.

The third book in the series has enough details in it that it can be read without having read the first two volumes. It would make a perfect chapter book to read to young children or for a 6,7, 8 year-old and up to read alone. As the family grows, Lily grows up gaining more responsibilities, often watching her baby brother, Paul. Her other siblings, Joseph and Dannie sometimes irritate her when she wants to spend time alone reading or painting pictures. Still she loves them and feels terrible when Dannie crashes into the barn on his first solo sled ride. Lily was supposed to be in charge, but couldn't resist his request to go down the hill alone. The family is trying to make the best of Christmas Day alone while Dannie recuperates, but would love to be with the extended family at Grandpa and Grandma's. They are surprised and touched when the entire Christmas Day feast is carried to them and all the relatives trek through the snow to spend the day with Lily's family. This is just one instance showing the strong family ties in the Amish brotherhood. School has been a highlight in Lily's life in the past years and she can't wait till it starts again, especially since cousin Hannah will be at her school now. When Hannah takes a liking to Aaron, the boy who seems to live to make Lily's days miserable, it comes between the cousins. Lily is also left defending herself when someone keeps switching sandwiches in the students' lunches, making it appear that Lily is stealing! Being shy, she can't seem to find the words to convince the teacher that she is innocent and that leads to notes home to Mama and Papa. They find it hard to believe their sweet girl would do such things. She is so distraught when it keeps happening that she starts checking her lunch in the morning and at recess. Teacher Rhoda catches her returning yet another sandwich \"plant\" and assuming Lily is guilty, she assigns an unreasonable number of sentence writing: \"Thou shalt not steal\". Finally Aaron, her nemesis, tells the teacher that he saw Effie making a switch involving Lily's lunch. That took courage, because Effie, not the nicest girl in class, would definitely get back at Aaron eventually! Home is a haven for Lily, especially her time with her father. When he takes her to town to help with the shopping, he rewards Lily with her first ice cream cone. She is delighted when he explains she can lick the ice cream right from the cone, but Papa forgot to explain that the cone was edible. Lily tosses it over the edge of the buggy thinking it was cardboard. She won't do that again! She loves artwork, so Mama surprises her with a box of 64 crayons. Later when they are destroyed in a school fire, Papa replaces them for her. He even took a box of paints, brushes and art books as part payment for some work he did which he presented to Lily. She began painting pictures for gifts and dreams of the day she will be a famous artist and have ice cream after dinner, every single day. Also,store bought bread and deli meat in every school lunch! Lily is still learning the lessons that every child needs to learn, how to think before she acts or speaks, and not to take matters into her own hands. The book ends with Lily turning ten, and that means a lot of changes in the clothes she wears and the privilege of sitting with her friends in church services. There will be one more book in this wholesome series and I just wish they had been written when my daughter was little! There are always granddaughters to read them to!

The story opens and it is summertime. She and her friend Beth have fun in Beth's playhouse. Bats in the belfry? Maybe not, but Lily's new attic room has a secret entrance her father cannot find. As school begins, Lily looks forward to her new school year. My favorites? A Big Chief tablet ~ I loved the long smooth pages; two sharpened Ticonderoga pencils, and a fresh box of crayons. I always got tripped up when math problems were reversed ~ how could they have the same answer?This is the third book in The Adventures of Lily Lapp series. Ages 8-12 will enjoy reading this series, as well as anyone else who likes Little House and Janette Oke prairie books. I especially like the illustrations by Tim Foley. They are pencil drawings that bring the story to life. My favorite is the Christmas at Whispering Pines picture. Papa was first to open the door, with Lily right on his heels. There on the porch were Grandpa, Grandma, and Aunt Susie! Behind them were Uncle Elmer's and Uncle Jacob's families. Everyone!

These are perfect for little girls. But my boys enjoyed listening to the books being read aloud.  In book 3 of the series we find Lily at 9 years old full of spunk and adventure. And as all little girls are at that age longing to be older and more grown up. She tries to outsmart Effie Kauffman at the very beginning of the book. But as a result Lily and an apple tree, with the most tempting apple hanging overhead, have a disagreement instead.  I loved reading about Lily's latest adventures. She is a very sweet girl with alot going on. Her family just recently moved into a new home and as Lily soon finds out, she has some visitors in her new attic room. Much unwanted visitors at that. Can't wait to see what is next with this series. The authors are on to something with this character. **Disclosure** This book was sent to me for free from Litfuse for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Tammi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10756388-tammi", "userReview": "Quickly Becoming A Family Favorite!Lily\u2019s story continues in the Adventures of Lily Lapp series by Suzanne Woods Fisher and Mary Ann Kinsinger with book three -- A Big Year for Lily. This series has been recommended for children ages 8-12; although I have been reading these books aloud to my girls, ages 6 and 9, and I have found myself looking forward to our nightly reading times. I have even caught my boys ages 11, 14, and 17 listening in. Amish children are not much different than \u201cEnglish\u201d children. They enjoy playing many of the same games, playing with friends, and have to learn to deal with feeling left out and being jealous. Lily has a hard time getting along with Effie Kauffman, who tends to be very bossy. When Lily decides to climb an apple tree to pick the apples that are out of reach, Effie declares she is sinning and being unlady-like. Lily declares that to be untrue, but when she jumps from the tree and rips the back of her dress she is more than a little embarrassed. Even at home there are sibling rivalries between Lily and her younger brothers. Lily finally was able to move from her hallway bedroom into her own bedroom in the attic. Her favorite part of the room was the window. She liked to pretend that it was a picture frame in which the picture changed throughout the day. But when bats started coming in and Papa couldn\u2019t find how, she moved into her parents\u2019 old room. Lily experienced marshmallow and baking adventures, as well as, some well placed lessons like when Lily and her father were painting a sign to advertise her father\u2019s woodworking business and a bumble bee landed in the wet paint on the sign. He wandered around the green sign with little white feet and Lily was upset over how the insect had ruined the perfect sign. \u2018Papa only smiled \u201cI don\u2019t think any one will notice those tracks unless they look closely.\u201d He dipped his paintbrush back into the jar of paint and started to paint another letter. \u201cYou know, Lily, the sign is a lot like the people we meet. If we want to find fault with it, we can look much closer and see things like those little tracks. In fact, by looking too closely, you\u2019ll notice that some of the letters aren\u2019t exactly perfect. If we focus on those little faults, we\u2019ll forget that the sign is actually a pretty good sign.\u201dPapa put the paintbrush down, \u201cI could brush some more green paint over those little tracks, but I think I\u2019ll just leave them. That way whenever you and I see this sign, it can remind us to focus on the good things in the people we meet instead of any little faults they might have.\u201d\u2019 (p.45)My girls and I have enjoyed reading through the Adventures of Lily Lapp series together and have enjoyed watching Lily as she grows-up. They have learned that although she is Amish she really isn\u2019t much different than them. **A Big Year for Lily by Suzanne Woods Fisher and Mary Ann Kinsinger was provided for me free by Litfuse Publicity Group in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Kathleen (Kat) Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328680-kathleen-kat-smith", "userReview": "Lily Lapp is nine and for a young Amish girl there are as many challenges for her as any nine-year-old girl. Her first and foremost issue is dealing with Aaron Yoder, a boy that thrives on teasing Lily whenever the opportunity becomes available. When her pencil rolls off the desk and she bends over to retrieve it, he holds his hand over her head while the rest of her class laughs. Her only hope this year is that her Cousin Hannah is joining her. Perhaps dealing with Aaron with an ally by her side won't be so bad after all. But when Hannah soon finds that Aaron isn't as bad as Lily claims and even finds herself wondering if Aaron likes her, Lily is literally at wit's end. Could this year possibly get any worse?In the latest novel, A Big Year for Lily, by authors Mary Ann Kinsinger and Suzanne Woods Fisher, The Adventures of Lily Lapp continues in book 3. Geared for children 8 and up, this makes a wonderful chapter book to get your child started in loving a different kind of life as an Amish child. Most of the time, there are very few differences between any nine-year-old. There are sibling rivalries as Lily is the only girl in a houseful of boys, there is the bossy classmate, Effie, who thinks all the things Lily is interested in are simply things a girl should never participate in, even calling a climb in the apple tree a sin, which Lily proudly proclaims is not. Only to her horror, she jumps from the tree and rips the backside of her dress causing her to be more than a little embarrassed. There are so many wonderful adventures that Lily participates in, from having finally achieved her own bedroom in the attic only to discover at night that bats are getting in somehow, to baking her mother a wonderful birthday cake which turns out hilarious. There are also some wise bits of Amish wisdom tucked away in some of these charming stories one of my favorites being the time Lily and her father were painting a sign for their mom and a bumble bee lands in the wet paint on the sign. He begins to wander around the green sign with white little feet and Lily is upset over the how the insect has ruined the perfect sign. Her father reminds her that each time she sees the sign it will remind her to focus on the good in others instead of seeing all their faults. I received A Big Year for Lily by Mary Ann Kinsinger and Suzanne Woods Fisher compliments of Litfuse Publicity and Revell Publishers for my honest review. I received no monetary compensation for a favorable review. I am super excited to share this latest novel with my niece who inhales chapter books as fast as I do novels. I can't wait to hear what she thinks of Lily's life growing up Amish and how it compares to hers. I rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars and can't wait for A Surprise for Lily coming soon. There is a great discussion guide at the end that helps parents explain to their children just what some of the concepts are in the Amish way of life and even a recipe for Lily's favorite Sweetheart Pudding which is served at Amish weddings."}, {"userName": "Laurie Carlson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4898049-laurie-carlson", "userReview": "This is the third book in The Adventures of Lily Lapp, A Big Year for Lily, and I think my favorite thus far! There will be a fourth in this series due out later which will complete it. These are absolutely charming books!These Chapter Books are gems just waiting to be discovered by little girls ages 8-12, or anyone who likes/loves to read about the Amish, even adults! Surprisingly, I learned a lot from reading these books as well, and it amazed me because I read a lot of Amish books and thought I knew all there was to know. Boy, was I wrong. There are things in this series of books I did not know about such as the things the children go through at their different ages, what's expected of them and more. Yes, there are the Little House on the Prairie books, and you could almost mistake these books as similar to them, but these books go further than those and are even better because these books have real, live people who are living this way \"today\" and every day! Little House, meet the Amish, and a little girl named Lily Lapp who are alive and living this way for the last three centuries, and will be well into the future!This book is about Lily turning 10. This is quite a year for her! Turning 10 brings about a lot of big changes and responsibilities for Lily. My favorite is her new dress. When the girls turn 10, they graduate into getting to wear the big girl dresses! This was an anticipated event for Lily! She got to go pick out the fabric for her new dress and proudly wear it in church, with a little drama added to it. My other favorite scene was when her brother gets his tongue stuck to something metal, in the winter! She said she felt bad but not to bad because she learned brothers were always thinking of things they shouldn't be doing! Yes, sometimes even the amish children are up to no good, just like English children, playing tricks on each other and other things, but they learn important lessons from them, and the parents make sure the children are aware of what they or their friends did is good or bad.These books also have beautiful pencil drawings/illustrations here and there throughout the book. The artist, Tim Foley, did a beautiful job!Grab this book and add it to your library. It will be an addition that will get read by many!I received this book for FREE from the publisher, Revell, a Division of Baker Publishing Group and LitFuse Publicity in exchange to read and write a review about it.

Lily is now turning 10 and her life is just full of adventure and fun! Of course there are also lessons to be learned that are not always fun and exciting. Things like being picked on at school by a particular boy, your teacher getting married and having one of the other girls in your class bully and boss you around. Then there are other changes like turning 10 and wearing \u2018pinned style of dress\u2019 a sure sign of a young Amish girl growing up!Both of my boys have been very curious about the Amish life. We live about 2 hours away from Lancaster, PA where many Amish folks live. Justin and Kaden are always very interested in the Amish folks when we travel out that way. We see their farms and riding in their buggies as they are traveling about. We have often wondered what life is like living without electricity or a car or television and going to school with your cousins. It is such an interesting life style. Reading about Lily, her family and her friends gives them {and me} a good idea of what Amish life is like. The family {and extended family} work together, many times live near each other in the same community, and are always there to lend a hand. Reading these stories gives us a glimpse into their life, their work ethic and the way in which the family lives. Lily is full of curiosity and that seems to land her in a bit of trouble from time to time. It also leads to some grand adventures!We have enjoyed reading A Big Year for Lily. The age recommendation is 8 and up. I would venture to say that these stories would be suitable to children as young as 5. They make a fantastic read alouds or reading together before bedtime. The chapters are not too long and the book itself is an easy read. It is a wholesome story, which is sometimes hard to come by these days and is quite refreshing. Another thing I would like to point out is that these books are not just for girls as you might think they are.

But to Lily's utter shock and amazement Hannah isn't of the same frame of mind as she is where Aaron Yoder is concerned. But growing up isn't easy and sometimes it isn't fair either. Effie Kauffman is as much a bully as ever and Lily and her friends are the target of Effie's meanness. But there are plenty of good points to growing up too. Lily gets to start wearing pinned clothes(ouch!!!) and sitting with the girls in church instead of with Mama. Lily has more adventures in cooking this time it isn't Jell-O but rather a birthday cake for Mama. Then there is a mishap with toasting marshmallows.Being the only girl with 3 younger brothers can be a bit of a challenge especially on Saturdays and house cleaning. Then there are the times when she has to watch baby Paul and everyone else is doing something Lily wants to do.A Big Year for Lily is sure to delight readers of the first two books in the Lily Lapp series as well as those new to the series. Lily is growing up and learning some important lessons along the way. Lily is a fairly good role model for young readers. Yes she makes mistakes and sometimes her thoughts may seem unreasonable, but she has a good relationship with her family which is a rare find in so many books marketed to young readers today.

We loved the newest installment of the Lily Lapp series. Within a week of receiving the book, my daughter read it twice - and is working her way through the series again. Any book that will encourage a love of reading like that is a winner in my book.A Big Year for Lily is as full of childish adventures and parental wisdom as the first Lily book. She deals with issues like what is truth?, who are my friends?, and how important is stuff?. The story teaches about these important lessons while entertaining in a fun way.I look forward to our upcoming book club event centered around A Big Year for Lily. There are so many opportunities within this book for children to act out Lily's adventures! Besides math, quilting, and cooking ideas, there are art and game options, too. For more specific plans, email me at amybradsher@gmail.com or keep watching for our book club post on a Friday in November. I don't want to give anything away here just yet if you haven't read the book! ;-)My Big Helper is already asking when the next Lily will be released. I'm not sure if Suzanne Woods Fisher and Mary Ann Kinsinger plan to collaborate on any more books after that one, but I hope that they do. Our kids need more books like this - books that are strong in family values, respect, honesty, truth, and, yes, adventure! Adventures that kids can really go and replicate on their own or with an adult's supervision. Please, keep'em coming, ladies!

She enjoys living near her cousin Hannah, but she has some problems with Effie Kauffman, a girl in her school who likes to play pranks. And then there\u2019s Aaron Yoder, a boy she\u2019s not sure about anymore. In addition, Lily\u2019s life takes on new problems and adventures when she turns 10.A BIG YEAR FOR LILY is a charming story geared toward children ages 8 to 12, but is entertaining for all ages. It combines the fascinating life of the Amish with a good balance of humor for an enjoyable and quick read. In addition, there are beautiful line drawings throughout the book that capture various moments of the story. The story flows smoothly and holds the readers attention from beginning to end.This enchanting book is a combined effort of bestselling author Suzanne Woods Fisher and author Mary Ann Kinsinger. Kinsinger, who relies on real-life stories of her childhood growing up Amish.The third of four installments in the Adventures of Lily Lapp, A BIG YEAR FOR LILY can be read alone. This a fun and informative read that will delight and inspire. You may want to read the previous books to catch up on Lily\u2019s prior fun and learning adventures. Can\u2019t wait to see what Lily\u2019s up to next.FTC Full Disclosure - I requested this book as part of the author\u2019s virtual book tour and it was sent to me by the publisher in hopes I would review it.

She still likes to play with dolls with her friends, but one girl in particular seems to rub her the wrong way. No matter what Lily does this girl claims do it better if she can't she says it isn't lady like and should not be done. Dolls is one of the things this young girl thinks they are too old to play anymore. This girl and a particular boy at school are always causing trouble for someone especially for Lily. Do you have anyone like this in your life? Someone that can ruin your whole day no matter how hard you try to avoid them.I really enjoy reading this series, each book brings to light the normal everyday antics of Lily, like how she interacts with family and friends. Sometimes she does not always use good judgement. One of her bad traits is, \"What my parents don't know won't hurt a thing.\" Wrong!I am sure children will learn many good lessons from the mistakes the children in this book create. There are a lot of good things that come from the children actions too!I highly recommend this book.I rated this book a 5 out of 5.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book from Litfuse Group/Revell for review.

Lily has her 10th birthday and that's a very big year in the life of a young Amish girl. She begins to dress differently, socialize differently, and supposedly behave differently.But Lily is Lily and try as she might, she finds herself in one scrape after another. At school she contents with the boys - specifically one who seems to torment her and yet takes up for her. She has an issue, continuously, with one of the bossy girls. But Lily learns lessons in truthfulness, kindness, honor, and grace. She learns not to be nosy but to somewhat, at least, curtail her curiosity.Lily is again a delightful little girl growing up Amish. But her life isn't really that much different from other little girls and the lessons each must learn as they grow. I heartily recommend this delightful book and series to young girls everywhere and to libraries public, church, school.DISCLOSURE: I was provided a complimentary copy of A Big Year for Lily in exchange for my honest review.

She is such a fun girl, so active, both physically and in her imagination, dreams and projects. Not all of her projects turn out like she envisions them to, but turn out they do. Add in her cousin and best friend Hannah and you are either chuckling at their antics or cringing at the eventual outcome. Typical ten year olds who do not have access to entertainment except books and what they make themselves, their lives are full of drama. I learnt somethings too about their lifestyle (who knew that your tenth birthday ushered in a new and exciting season) and their dress. Those things that came up would not have been covered in an adult novel, because they would be of particular interest to young girls. I did not get the second book in the series, and though I do not have children in my house, I want to get each one of the series. Not since Little House on the Prairie have I found such a refreshing children's book series.I received this book free from Revell Publishing Group through Litfuse Publicity Group in exchange for an honest opinion.

She will gain some new duties, and loose some fun things she enjoyed.She loves that her cousin Hannah now lives nearby, but does Hannah have to like that awful boy Aaron? Made me think, that maybe in the future there maybe some interest in Aaron by Lily, and I can hear her now screaming at me...\"No Way!!\"This book gives you a good feeling about people, loved the way Lily's Dad handled the boys who were stealing from them.
