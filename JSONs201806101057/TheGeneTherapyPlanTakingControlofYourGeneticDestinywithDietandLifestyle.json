What he brings to us in this book is the concept of treating the entire person through a combination of allopathic approaches and alternative therapies - an approach he calls The Gene Therapy Plan. It is a breath of fresh air to all of us who have been practicing medicine for years.With the advances in technology come some miracles and - some ill effects. The presence of computer technology has altered not only the way we communicate and isolate ourselves by relying on instant texting and selfies and apps and docs and memory sticks, it has also altered medicine, some would say in a good way, others have noted the distancing between physician and patient that occurs when that 10 minute appointment becomes a faceless entering of data and prescribing on an iPad using codes instead of words and caring eye contact and, God forbid, laying on of hands. Terms now common are MRI, CT, chemo, and even in the operating room Robotics and laparoscopes have replaced skilled surgeons' hands and touch and integration of all the senses. There is a growing dichotomy between practicing medicine by treating the whole patient and coding a diagnosis that plugs into approach A, B, or C - depending on the schematic pain of the medical center. Where does that lead? `Fixing things' as opposed to healing and guiding toward health in all facets of living.Hello, Dr. Gaynor! In this intensely helpful book he takes us through the approach that connects mind, body, nutrition, and restoring balance to our bodies to overcome genetic dispositions toward eventual disease states. `We all have the seeds of illness within us. The question is whether that potential for disease will become active or will remain dormant.' He uses the nutrigenetic approach `Using nutrients in this strategic way to combat disease and promote good health is called \"nutrigenetics,\" and it is the core principle of the Gene Therapy Plan. Nutrigenetics is actually a subset of a broader approach called \"ecogenetics,\" which is focused more broadly on how we live in our environment and how the environment as a whole interacts with the individual's genome to produce either health or disease. Our level of physical activity, for instance, may encourage (or discourage) the production of more inflammation-suppressing enzymes. Meanwhile, whether we are fat or lean affects whether we send out weaker (if we are lean) or stronger (if we are obese) signals to suppress cancer-killing substances...The Gene Therapy Plan takes all these interactions into account. It is designed to help you combat the most prevalent and troubling diseases of our time, and it does so in the context of promoting overall health and well-being through weight control, stress reduction, and exercise.`In his warm yet scholarly Introduction he opines, `You are what you eat', my mother always told me. But it wasn't until after I'd finished my medical training and become a cancer specialist that I learned just how profoundly right she was.' It is that tone that he maintains throughout this resource for healthy living book. `Today I divide my time equally between Gaynor Integrative Oncology, a practice focused on treating cancer patients, and Gaynor Wellness, in which I apply the same ecogenetic principles to treating people with a variety of concerns, ranging from general health maintenance and disease prevention to weight loss, insomnia, chronic fatigue, dermatological diseases, and Parkinson's. Both practices incorporate meditation, music therapy, guided imagery, and cognitive behavioral therapy in concert with activities such as restorative physical therapy, yoga, aerobic exercise, and qigong as well as nutritional counseling based on the same principles presented here in the Gene Therapy Plan. My aim is always to treat the entire person in a way that acknowledges the complex nature of chronic illness, and to work at every level of the body's healing processes--physiological, genetic, psychosocial, and spiritual-- to create an optimal state of well-being.'The book is divided into two parts: Targeting Disease with Gene Therapy, and Implementing the Plan. He discusses the basic plan and how it applies to obesity, heart disease, cancer, diabetes and aging, and then he devotes a large portion of the book to recipes that reflect the basics of his tenets. Holistic medicine, that healthy marriage between Eastern and Western methods, is here. `The Gene Therapy Plan can achieve those objectives, but its purpose is much more basic and comprehensive. It is designed to keep dormant disease dormant, and to help active disease go back to being dormant. And it does so in an integrated way that keeps a multitude of health variables in proper balance. The Gene Therapy Plan weaves all these elements into a consciously holistic picture of total human wellness that also addresses all the microscopic dormant and precursor conditions that could, given the wrong ecogenetic influence, turn into illness.' Hope and Wholeness from a very rich mind."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25530894-nikki", "userReview": "*Received free advanced copy*The Gene Therapy Plan by Mitchell L. Gaynor M.D. is about using food to change a person\u2019s genetic predisposition for disease using ecogenetics, the science of applying the ideology of personalized medicine by using explicit substances to target a person\u2019s genetic profile for developing different diseases. Basically it\u2019s about different nutritional aspects of disease prevention. The Gene Therapy Plan talks about Nutrigenics, how we live in our environment and how our environment interacts with our genome.This is unlike many of the diet and health books that are out there. The Gene Therapy is easy to understand, backed by science, and gives you super simple ways to make small changes toward a healthier you. Of course The Gene Therapy tells you what fats are bad, too many carbs are bad, and that not all diets are considered equal.One of the most helpful and interesting things to me was in one part of the book gives you some different phytochemicals, their sources in whole foods, and their benefits. I suffer from an autoimmune disease and insulin resistance. This part was particularly helpful with pointing out which foods have anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and immune boosting benefits. This way I can focus on adding more of these certain foods into my diet.The Gene Therapy addresses Obesity, Heart Disease, Cancer, Diabetes, and Aging giving detailed information about foods and supplements that can benefit you. Even if you are not obese, have diabetes, or heart disease a person can benefit. If an illness runs in your family there is information in here for you about how to prevent it by simply adding something small into your diet, like a specific fruit or supplement! I\u2019ll be honest, I am not the most motivated person to eat healthy or make a lifestyle change. I\u2019m actually a terrible dieter. I just watch what I eat and exercise every now and then. I cannot stress how easy this books makes becoming a healthier you. All I have done is add more of certain things already in my diet to reap more of the benefits they provide.At the end of the book there are sample shopping lists, meal plans, recipes for those who need a little more guidance but like I said I\u2019m kind of lazy when it comes to making real big changes. Overall, I was very impressed with how simple Dr. Gaynor broke everything down to making steps toward being a healthier you. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to making either minor or major changes to their lifestyle. The Gene Therapy truly has something to offer for every one of all ages."}, {"userName": "J.

Wish there was a silver bullet for the ills of aging, diabetes, heart disease etc... but there is not. He does however, give you some wonderful tips on eating that will help you with each of these problems. He discusses the causes of the problems and shows you how you can work to prevent them. Rather than force yourself to an uncomfortable diet you can just make sure that you eat in thirds. An abundance of information. Enjoy.J.

I read it like a textbook, highlighting sections and making comments in the margins. Mitchell Gaynor presents nutritional information in a scientific, accessible, and applicable format. I have been telling everyone about this book. I can't wait till it's out so I can tell everyone I know to buy copies. If you are serious about using food, for preventive health, rather than medication to mask symptoms or remediate damage, you will love this book."}, {"userName": "Richie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36952878-richie", "userReview": "lots of good stuff in here.

Gaynor, M.D., is an excellent book that suggests not only how to stay healthy but what alternate plans to consider when you are sick and are not responding to your prescribed treatment.The introduction to his book is written by Dr. Oz who has sent many of his patients to Dr. Gaynor for treatment as has many other physicians when their treatment plan is not working.Dr. Gaynor, takes an integrative approach to medicine and offers very good advice on foods, drinks and natural substances to take advantage of to remain healthy, such as olive oil, coconut milk and oils, green tea, chamomile tea, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, juicing, etc.But his plan goes far beyond eating foods that are healthy but seeks to harness the power hidden in foods to change our genetic predisposition for disease. In this approach Dr. Gaynor draws heavily on a branch of study known as ecogenetics.Dr. Gaynor, discusses in terms we can understands how ecogenetic food changes our genetic blueprint and provides scientific data to support alternative therapies and age-old practices, The key approach is to use identified nutrients to combat disease and promote good health. That approach is called \u201cnutrigenetics: and is the core principle of the Gene Therapy Plan. The \u201cGene Therapy Plan\u201d is designed to help you resist cancer, heart disease and diabetes, maintain a healthy weight, reverse low immunity, softening the effects of aging, remove toxins from the body, and to promote energy. Dr. Gaynor has a lot of fascinating things to say about obesity, heart disease, cancer, diabetes and aging in Part I. Then in Part II the author presents sample meal plans, recipes, and how to make several juices, smoothies and snacks. The recipes are very good; I\u2019ve tried some and look forward to trying many more.I\u2019ve made some changes in my life as a result of reading this book. I am now substituting coconut milk for my flavored coffee cream, have returned to drinking green tea and having switched to orange and orange and lemon-flavored teas, and make sure broccoli and Brussels sprouts are included in my weekly meals. This book is certainly worth reading; it will provide lots of new insights and motivation to make changes for a more healthy life."}, {"userName": "William Nist", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18846038-william-nist", "userReview": "A couple of years ago, I got a gene test from 23&Me. It revealed some diseases I am predisposed to and some diseases that I probably would not have to deal with. The book is about the connection of genes to disease and how you can alter the 'expression' of genes through diet and dietary supplementation. I do think there is enough medical theory to justify such a connection. The author of this book is an oncologist who works at the Weill Cornell Medical School in NYC (so no fly by night doc!). The problem that I have with this book is that to follow the advice of Dr Gaynor, based on the diseases that I need to carefully avoid, is that the program dictates so many supplements as to make it impractical. I don't feel comfortable taking 30-40 different products (which is what I would need to do to counter just 2 of my major gene threats + his anti aging regimen). He does not think, given the state of our food supply, that the diet alone can supply these substances, although he does five lists of food that should also be consumed. Much of the food advice I am already following -- his diet is a lot like the Perfect Health Diet of Paul Jaminet -- viz., 1/3 carbs, 1/3 fat and 1/3 protein but with a lot of helpful specific suggestions for quality improvement. He does offer a 2 week diet plan and a lot of recipes, which I found singularly unappealing with many obscure ingredients rendering them useless. So the bottom line is that his premise and theory seems reasonable, but the practical application is difficult and maybe beyond the abilities or desire of many readers."}, {"userName": "Janine Brouillette", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8427267-janine-brouillette", "userReview": "What a wonderful book on such a timely topic.
