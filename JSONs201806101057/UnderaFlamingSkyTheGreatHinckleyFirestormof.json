The relevance to today as much of our country goes up in smoke cannot be overstated. There is much information here that was news to me, details about prairie fires. Much of the book is taken up with a novelistic recreation of the actions of a host of real people, some of whom survived the event, most of whom did not. I found that I was not all that engaged with the personal struggles, but was far more interested in the scientific details. Obviously there is considerable overlap as the science describes how human beings are forcefully discorporated by a horrendous natural force. P 64[referring to Fire in America by Steven Pyne] In Pyne\u2019s terminology, a mass fire that remains stationary is a firestorm; one that moves is a conflagration. Regardless of this finer distinction, though, all mass fires have certain characteristics that set them apart from ordinary wildfires. They are typically born when two or more smaller fires\u2014often a main fire and the spot fires that it has spawned around its periphery\u2014suddenly merge into a single eruption of flame. The flaming fronts may tower as high as one hundred feet over the tops of the trees, or two hundred feet above the ground. They may advance as fast at 15 miles per hour on level ground\u2014much faster on a slope\u2014and release energy at rates as high at 30,000BTU\u2019s per foot of fire line per second. They create huge convection columns that loom over the surrounding countryside, radiating heat downward and thus drying out the fuel in their paths.At one point, toward the peak of the Sundance Fire\u2019s intensity, observers saw the side of an entire mountain, the west slope of Apache ridge, erupt into flames in a single instant. The angle of the ridge had exposed the mountainside to an enormous amount of radiant heat from the convection column, quickly drying out the forest and raising its temperature the kindling point. The first ember that landed on the mountainside had then ignited the whole thing as if it were soaked in gasoline. P 65Mass fires also generate enormous winds, often of hurricane velocity. Sometimes these winds begin to rotate and become cyclonic, creating fire vortices\u2014tornadoes of fire that may advance well ahead of the main flaming front. Because of the tremendous draft in their convection columns, mass fires typically pick up thousands of flaming of glowing firebrands\u2014some as large as burning logs. They may carry these as much as 18,000 feet into the air before throwing them miles ahead of their fronts, spawning spot fires wherever the firebrands land in fuel. And because mass fires consume their fuel so rapidly, they often exhaust all the available oxygen in the air before they have finished burning off all the carbon and volatile gases that they have released from their fuels. As a result they produce vast clouds of black smoke, black because it\u2019s carrying a heavy load of unburned carbon. As this superheated carbon rises, it eventually encounters enough oxygen to allow combustion to resume, and flames arc in sheets across the sky. To people on the ground it appears that the sky itself is on fire. Most spectacularly of all, glowing bubbles of the gases released by fire\u2014bubbles that may be as big as a car or even a house\u2014may float some distance ahead of the fire like gigantic balloons dancing in the sky before igniting suddenly over the heads of onlookers.P 79[regarding a group of people in a clearing]\u2026there was fire on all sides of them now, and the heat was withering, searing their faces amd forcing their eyes shut. With every minute that passed, the heat was becoming more unbearable. Instinctively, people got down on their hands and knees and pressed their mouths close to the ground, sucking in cooler air. People prayed and cried and wailed. They gagged and wretched on the smoke. Some simply sat in the grass, staring at the approaching flames as is they could see something through them. Soon the flames dropped down from the trees and dances along the edges of the clearing all around them, rippling through the grass that had looked so cool and green. They made a sharp crackling sound in the grass. Billows of sweet-smelling white smoke drifted up toward the black sky. Moaning, people rose and pulled away from the advancing flames, crowding each other, jostling each other as they pulled back, packing themselves into the very center of the clearing.But within moments, there was no more room to pull back and the flames were upon them, lapping at their feet, blistering their ankles and shins, racing up their clothing, slapping at their faces. One by one, the women\u2019s long dresses erupted\u2014large tangerine-orange blossoms of fire wavering in the smoky gloom. Everyone screamed, but the screams came out thin and unnaturally high-pitched. The withering heat had dessicated their vocal cords, pulling them taught like overstretched rubber bands. Grown men suddenly sounded like young girls. When the screams were over they had to breathe in, and when they did they inhaled flames and superheated air, sucking the flames into their very mouths. Then, clawing at the air, black silhouettes dancing among the orange flames, they began to die.P 83 Fire kills in several ways, depending on the circumstances. Some are much worse than others. The luckiest of fire\u2019s victims die in their sleep, something that is surprisingly easy to do. All fires consume large amounts of oxygen and emit large amounts of carbon monoxide. They may emit a number of other gases as well, depending on the fuel that feeds them, and many of these gases, like carbon dioxide and cyanide, can also kill. But carbon monoxide kills the overwhelming majority of fire victims. Because it is tasteless and odorless, sleeping victims often never awaken to see, hear or smell the fire that kills them. The brain will scream out for more oxygen if carbon dioxide builds up in the lungs, but carbon monoxide is subtler. A stealth killer it sets off no alarms. It silently fills the lungs then\u2014bonding to the hemoglobin in the blood 250 times more readily than oxygen to form a compound called carboxyhemoglobin (COHb)\u2014it rapidly displaces the oxygen in the bloodstream. The brain and other vital organs are caught unawares. Suddenly deprived of oxygen, and having no other choice, vital organs such as the brain simply shut down, rather promptly. By the time the saturation of CODb in the bloodstream reaches 90 percent, death comes in minutesUnfortunately, death by fire is not always so easy. Fully conscious victims, if they are surrounded by both flames and adequate oxygen, may remain alert until the flames have reached them and begun to consume their flesh. Oxygen ordinarily represents 21 percent of the air we breath, but we can generally maintain consciousness until the level falls to about 9 percent. Even if the flames themselves do not make it to conscious victims, it sometimes happens that those victims are forced to breathe superheated air\u2014air that still contains some oxygen but is so hot that it burns away the soft tissues in their mouths, throats and vocal chords. These people know, for at least a few moments, what it is like to be burned alive, both from without and from within. If victims do not lose consciousness and there fore stay in one place anc continue to breathe the hot gases for a prolonged period of time, the damage from these hot gases may extend into their lower respiratory systems. Then even their alveoli, the 300 million or so tiny air sacks that line the lungs and transfer oxygen to the bloodstream, may be burned away, a fate that many people in the dry marsh north of the Grindstone probably suffered. But the fire has even worse to offer.Fire always emits heat in the form of radiation. Radiant heat travels away from its source at the speed of light, so, for all practical purposes, it is felt instantaneously by anyone in the vicinity of a fire. This is the hat you feel on your face sitting in front of a fireplace on a cold winter\u2019s evening. If you raise a hand, or any other shield, between your face and the fire, the heat on your face disappears immediately. The radiation emitted by a fire falls away fairly quickly with distance., so if you move your chair across the room it is likely that you won\u2019t feel any noticeable heat on your face, though the air in the room may well be heated by convection from the fire. If the fire is big enough\u2014say, a bonfire on a beach\u2014you may have to stand quite a distance from it in order to be comfortable. But if it\u2019s as big as a forest fire, you may not be able to get far enough away from it fast enough to avoid being broiled alive. This is the unkindest way fire kills, by the sheer application of heat. It is only likely to happen when the victim has enough oxygen to breathe for a sustained period of time\u2014thus remaining fully conscious\u2014but is still near enough to an overwhelming source of heat to be killed by it. Fortunately, since large fires consume enormous amounts of oxygen, this is relatively rare.July 5, 2012 - Timothy Egan's column addresses what can only be called The Burning Time as the summer of 2012 puts the lie to deniers of global warming"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt", "userReview": "If I ever have kids - and ain't that a notion! - I will never let them play video games or watch violent movies or do any of the other things I was so happy to do as a child. That's because I am acutely aware of how a young mind can be indelibly molded by the experiences of childhood. My current (and undiminished) obsessions with the Titanic, Custer's Last Stand, and the Alamo, all flow from my early introduction to these harrowing stories of men and women in the last moments of their life, enacting immortal drams under lethal duress. Case in point: the Great Hinckley Fire of September 1, 1894. I first learned about the fire while on a family vacation to Duluth, Minnesota. We stopped in Hinckley to get locally famous cinnamon rolls (which is a crock, because all cinnamon rolls taste the same: pretty good) and saw a sign for the Hinckley Fire Museum. Since this was during my firefighter stage (all boys go through it), we all went. Oh, such fascinating horrors! There was an old-time fire wagon with hand pump and hose. There were sundry items of daily life, charred almost beyond recognition. There was a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 diorama. Heck, there was even an animatronic telegraph operator tapping out haunting messages from a town in the path of a firestorm. I learned grim and unforgettable things, of a tornado of fire, and trains racing over burning trestles, and people sheltering in a mill pond even as sawdust floating on the surface exploded into flames.During college, I plotted out a book on the Hinckley Fire. Why? Because, at the time, there was no great book on the subject. I gathered materials, did my research, and outlined the structure. I even called the helpful librarian at the Fire Museum to get ideas. Then I figured it'd be easier to write a novel, since a novel doesn't require endnotes. Another idea hit me. Why don't I add a serial killer? And what if the \"serial killer\" was actually a terrifying bear-creature? I thought this was a good idea, because I always liked the idea of writing a crime procedural, but I'm horrible coming up with satisfying conclusions to mysteries (in much the same way as the writers of Lost, I'm afraid). With the fire, my ending wrote itself. Everything burns. Deus ex genius. (In other words, I meant to combine the Howie Long classic Firestorm with the William Girdler epic Grizzly and John McNaughton's incisive Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer). I actually wrote three chapters one night. Then I went to the bar, drank myself to a free t-shirt, and never wrote another word. I think about that sometimes, as I pay my student loans. The point of that digression is that I didn't want to like this book. I wanted the seminal Hinckley Fire work to remain in my hands. Well, it's not. This book is the place to go for everything you need or want to know about Hinckley. Author Daniel James Brown combines Walter Lord-style personal narratives with fascinating and informative digressions on the forerunner of the National Weather Service, trains, fire science, and the nature of burns. The thing that most impressed me was his ability to transition between the two styles. It makes for a book that is propulsively readable; once you start, you're going to want to finish in one sitting (so maybe don't take it to your wife's house on Easter, okay?). The book provides facts for your mind, and blood and guts for your 10 year-old boy-mind. Here's what I mean. On one page, you get a little applied science: Mass fires...generate enormous winds, often of hurricane velocity. Sometimes these winds begin to rotate and become cyclonic, creating fire vortices - tornadoes of fire that may advance well ahead of the main flaming front. Because of the tremendous updraft in their convection columns, mass fires typically pick up thousands of flaming or glowing firebrands...They may carry these as much as 18,000 feet into the air before throwing them miles ahead of their fronts, spawning spot fires wherever the firebrands land in fuel. And because mass fires consume their fuel so rapidly, they often exhaust all the available oxygen in the air before they have finished burning all the carbon and volatile gases that they have released from their fuels. As a result, they produce vast clouds of black smoke, black because it's carrying a heavy load of unburned carbon. Then, on another page, it's the human dimension. For instance, you might learn about 127 men, women, and children who tried to take shelter in a grassy clearing that - but for a severe drought - would've been a swamp. [W:]ithin moments, there was no more room to pull back and the flames were upon them, lapping at their feet, blistering their ankles and shins, racing up their clothing, slapping at their faces. One by one, the women's long dresses erupted - large, tangerine-orange blossoms of fire wavering in the smokey gloom. Everyone screamed, but the screams came out thin and unnaturally high-pitched. The withering heat had desiccated their vocal cords, pulling them taut like overstretched rubber bands. Grown men suddenly sounded like young girls. When the screams were over, they had to breathe in, and when they did they inhaled flames and superheated air, sucking the flames into their very mouths.The destruction of Hinckley, and several other towns in the area, dwarfed the Great Chicago Fire (there were 418 reported deaths, though the number may be twice as high). In terms of pure drama, I don't think Hinckley has an equal. Brown has done an incredible job of marshaling the individual stories and presenting them in a vivid manner, while also giving the context of the disaster. Brown shows how a simple confluence of weather (a drought), clear-cutting of timber (which left a great deal of slash along the railways) and railroads (embers from an engine likely sparked the blaze) precipitated disaster. He analyzes these occurrences, and also, without drawing harsh conclusions, the actions of some of the major players, especially the train engineers (specifically Bill Best and Jim Root) who were accused of driving into the fire in order to maintain their timetables. If there's a criticism, it's that the chapters after the fire, dealing with Hinckley's rebirth (as a place to get cinnamon rolls on the way to Duluth) are anticlimactic. Really, though, I can't really find fault with this, the last word on the subject of the Great Hinckley Fire. The only thing it's missing is a serial killing monster from the depths of the forest, loosely-based on Chippewa legends, and perhaps with an environmental motive to its seemingly random slaughter. That book is yet to be written (please don't steal it from me!)"}, {"userName": "Corey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/866083-corey", "userReview": "All of my life I've heard about The Great Hinckley Fire and have seen multiple pictures of the monument but I never knew much about what happened other than my great-great grandparents were able to escape with my great grandfather and his siblings. I've always wanted to know more but never really knew where to look since I'm in Ohio and have never been to Minnesota. In High School we had to write a play or novel based on a historic event and I wrote mine based on the fire and actually almost failed because my history teacher thought I made it up or that it was the Chicago fire that I meant to write about but placed it elsewhere. So, when I came across this book in a Listopia on Goodreads I ordered it immediately! Imagine my surprise when I found out not only was my family in the book (the Curries) but my Aunt was mentioned in it as well as she helped with some research! I had pretty high hopes when that book landed at my door and was worried that it wouldn't live up to the kind of book I'd hoped it be. I had recently read The Children's Blizzard and while it was interesting, it wasn't quite as engaging as I had hoped it would be. My worries were for naught though as Under a Flaming Sky was not only informative but very engaging. While there is a bit of technical talk, it's all laid out so that anyone could understand it and it actually helps you place yourself in Hinckley and the surrounding areas during the fire. From the moment I picked up the book it was very hard to put it down - even the ending where he lists all of his sources was interesting to read! While the book doesn't quite go deep into depth with the survivors stories as I would have liked, this is definitely one of my favorite disaster/history books I've read and that is without the fact that if my family didn't survive the fire storm I wouldn't be here ;) Definitely a highly recommended read to anyone that likes survival or disaster type stories about events in history!"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky", "userReview": "What.a.book.I just realized the other night that I\u2019ve been back in my home state of Nebraska for a full year after a warm five year respite in the South. That means, since its now November, this is going to be my first full winter back. It started slow last year, which suited me fine, but it culminated in one 8 inch snow, and then a final 2 inch snow in the beginning of May. Now, for the first time in years, I\u2019m going to sit through the whole thing. Already the temperatures swing back and forth, 30 one day, and 70 the next. You never know where you are going to land. The Midwest is a harsh place most of the year, and I can only imagine in days before actual houses and weather forecasting that it was terrifying. Even in the warmth and insulated safety of my house, the wind howls like mad outside, and there are times in the winter when I can understand why pioneers just walked out into the snow because they couldn\u2019t take \u201cthe damn wailing of the wind\u201d any longer. So as a sort of dark \u201cwelcome back\u201d I officially nominate the 2013 Winter Reading Season as Natural Disaster and Survival themed reading. I would say that reading about the Hinckley forest fire kicked things off, but really, it\u2019s gripping, white-knuckled narrative and wealth of information are what has inspired the season, rather than the other way around.When I told my husband I was doing a themed Disaster reading he thought I\u2019d lost my mind. He reminded me that I had to repeatedly put the book down, saying \u201cWow, that just got really hard to read\u201d as the town slowly burned to death. Why would I want to continue? Because I learned so much. I had no idea. I knew nothing about ground fires and conflagration, or how fast these things could move, or how the convective air currents will hit the upper atmosphere, tip down, and start a new fire several miles away by blasting new trees with air in excess of 2,000 degrees. It makes you appreciate what forest fires do today, what people in other countries still have to deal with, the dangers of our current method of fire control in national parks. I was literally bubbling with information about forest fires, willing (unfortunately to those within earshot) to evangelize this new and fascinating knowledge to anyone. How could they not be just as curious? Its fire! It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s necessary and destructive.And you read these kinds of stories and are very often filled with wonder and hope. The men stayed behind, ensuring that women and children got on the trains first; the conductors, trains on fire, one bleeding from the neck, held on to scorching hot metal to drive that train as fast and as far as they could from the fire. They were heroes. They risked themselves, their jobs, their futures, as they stood their ground in front of a literal mountain of flame. I honestly can\u2019t say I\u2019d do the same. Maybe I would. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t. You cannot know until you\u2019re faced with something like that, but you can be in awe. They stood their ground against the caveman and the biology and evolution for self-preservation, and won. And saved hundreds. Even when things were tragic, and they found parents curled around their children, it\u2019s beautiful in the love and the sacrifice that they made. They tried to do everything to save their children, trying to take the pain from them. Reading about tragedies gives you a beautiful wonderful glimmer of what mankind can be like at its absolute best. Nothing can compare.The narrative was told from the point of view of several people, each had different experiences during the fire, which provides a comprehensive look at the disaster. I have to admit that at times I became far too terrified for these \u201ccharacters\u201d that I logged onto the Hinckley Fire Museum webpage and read Dr. Stephan\u2019s death list, to try and see who would come out alive. I was that stressed reading about the fire. After finishing the book I took out my New York Times Cover pages book, and though this page wasn\u2019t in the book, I did find it on the cd\u2019s that came with the book. I read through the New York Times article, comparing it to the book, to what I know now. It was a singular experience.Now I\u2019m moving on to those books which the author said inspired him and provided an outline for how a disaster book should be written .

In the town of Hinckley, people escaped on two trains, one of which was already in flames by the time it pulled out of the station in a desperate attempt to reach a lake 5 miles away. Author Daniel Brown grew up with this story since his grandfather survived the fire as a child. If you liked The Children\u2019s Blizzard you'll probably like this, too. Brown uses the same storytelling technique, weaving together the stories of individuals across the same timeline and adding lots of information about fires in general, the railroads, and logging. I sometimes lost track of what was happening to different people (it\u2019s Minnesota so lots of Scandinavian names), and will probably read this again in a more leisurely way.

The first was that it was the last such great fire in what had once been a vast conifer forest spread out across what are now the states of Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and southern Canada. The Peshtigo fire burned off much of that rich forest, and by 1894, of what hadn't been burned off, most had been logged off. Only in parts of Minnesota and Michigan did such tracts of conifer forest still exist, ripe for the loggers' saws, in 1894. The Hinckley firestorm burned off most of what was left, thereby murdering the lumber industry in that part of the country, because of which the industry packed up and headed for the Pacific Northwest, where the last great stands of pine forest still existed. The second reason was the sheer, raw speed of destruction: the Hinckley firestorm burned off 350,000 acres in just *five hours* -- Oregon's infamous Biscuit Fire took a *week* to do that much damage. Third, while the body-count of the Hinckley fire was nowhere near that of the 1871 firestorm at Peshtigo, nevertheless officially it racked up over four hundred kills, and many more, unknown to any but God, may have died in the fires, as well. Fourth, the Hinckley fire is famous for the role the railroads and heroic railroad men played in it. As fire surrounded the town, two railroads became the only avenues of escape. The engineers and a heroic young African-American porter risked their lives to bring refugees to safety from the bowels of the firestorm. One train caught fire from end to end, and the porter ran up and down the length of his train, reassuring passengers, keeping them from jumping to certain death in the fires outside, until a place of safety was reached and they could disembark with some chance of survival. On the other train, the engineer refused to back out of town until the last possible minute in order to give those trying to flee the town and the fires a maximum chance of reaching the train and escaping the holocaust. The fifth reason was that the great Hinckley fire led to a revolution in forestry management practices and the birth of federal agencies that monitor and fight wildfires today. UNDER A FLAMING SKY is also remarkable for the information it gives on burn injuries and the way fire kills, as well as descriptions of the way firestorms behave that make them distinct from ordinary fires. Firestorms create their own weather, including hurricane-strength winds, bubbles of glowing, soot-encrusted plasma at temperatures high enough to cause anything they touched to burst into flame, 200-foot-tall flames advancing on miles-wide fronts, and \"fire whirls,\" or tornadoes of fire, dancing out from the main body of the fire, knocking down buildings, carrying flaming debris high into the sky. Temperatures of the Hinckley fire reached at least 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit -- the melting point of steel. Like the Peshtigo firestorm, the Hinckley firestorm should never have happened -- and wouldn't if modern forestry and fire-safety practices had been in effect. That it did happen is one of the great tragedies of America's history. Replete with a wealth of examples of human behavior in fires and including reproductions of contemporary photographs of the effects of the Hinckley firestorm, pre-firestorm Hinckley, and portrait photos of the heroic railroad men who saved so many, the administrators who oversaw the distribution of food, clothing, and other desperately needed supplies to survivors of the fires, and the ghouls who prowled the ruins of homes and outbuildings, looking for souvenirs, this book is worth tracking down and acquiring for its historical, scientific, and human treasures."}, {"userName": "Joel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9058325-joel", "userReview": "In 1894, a ferocious firestorm swept through northeast Minnesota, wiping out a number of towns (the biggest one being Hinckley), killing hundreds, and leaving many hundreds more injured and homeless and destitute. The author, whose great-grandfather perished in the fire, does a great job here of combining the accounts of the survivors into a cohesive narrative. When people saw the fire coming, they reacted in a number of different ways. Some hid in their cellars or jumped down wells, some were able to get aboard trains fleeing the area (although the trains themselves were in danger of burning up), some sought safety in rivers and lakes and gravel pits; some simply panicked and ran. The author tries to track as many of the disparate stories as possible, giving the reader an overview of what was happening all through the path of the fire.The best part of the book are the occasional asides full of relevant background information. In one section, he describes in detail the weather conditions which encouraged the forest fire to grow. In another section, he describes the different types of forest fire, and what happened, scientifically, to cause this one to grow into such an unstoppable inferno. He launches into a medical description- a bit gruesome, actually- of what happens inside the bodies of people who have suffered horrible burns; and he summarizes modern knowledge of the mental problems (post-traumatic stress disorder, etc.) suffered by people who have survived disasters.My one quibble is about a subject that Brown only lightly touches upon. He mentions that the Hinckley fire, and several other wildfires that hit the Northwoods in subsequent decades, prompted changes in logging practices and how the government manages the nations's forests. I would have liked him to go deeper into that subject, and explain what forestry management techniques have been developed to try and prevent this sort of disaster from happening again. But perhaps it's not directly relevant to a book specifically about the Hinckley fire.Nevertheless, the book is a captivating read. If you want stories of human heroism, selflessness, and courage in the face of adversity, this book has them.

It's sadder than sad and unflinching as it looks at the horrible things that happened to so many people on that September day in 1894. Brown has a close personal connection to the fire, and the introduction about his grandfather waking up screaming decades later caught my attention right away.Brown covers the science of fires, but instead of giving it its own chapter he masterfully weaves it into the fabric of the story. I found myself actually holding my breath at some points from the sheer beauty of science mixing with the horror of what was about to happen to the people of Hinckley, Sandstone, and other towns. Brown reminds without being preachy that these are good people and bad, people like myself and my family. Some would survive, albeit with heartbreaking injuries, but most would die.Make no mistake, this is not a happy read. There are few happy endings, as so often happens in real life. These are people who were literally in over their heads with the towering wall of fire leaning over them. In this age of global climate change, I expect to see more fires like these, here and elsewhere. I can only hope that we learn from the mistakes made by our predecessors. Brown goes into the history of what made the region what it was, and why it was so easy to ignore the warning signs. There are acts of selflessness and bravery here, and they are wonderful to read and understand. Many people will say they could never understand what the people affected by the fire went through, and this is true. Reading this, I got closer to comprehending.I never quite cried, but it was a close thing. Brown is a gifted writer. I am going to seek out his other books with confidence that, like this book, I may not enjoy the story but I will be a wiser person for hearing him tell it so well."}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3904308-heidi", "userReview": "I have this strange fascination for disaster survival stories. I think what draws me to them the most is discovering the way people respond when such awful things occur. This book I've read before interestingly enough, but it felt like a first read. Brown has done a phenomenal job of putting the reader in the story. Not only does he tell the story of a horrible wildfire that wreaked havoc, but he also delves into some of the things society has learned about fire over the last hundred years. He talks about several different kinds of fires and what made this one so dangerous. He compares the Hinckley fire to several other deadly fires that have occurred over the years, which made it easier to understand just how big this fire got. Admittedly, it was hard to read about the people dying, fire is a horrible way to die after all. But the part that made me the sickest and yet impressed me the most were the descriptions of what the rescuers and clean-up crews found when they came to help. I was really impressed by how many people jumped in to provide help and how fast they did it. How the rescuers managed to face the horribly burned bodies of men, women, and children, I really don't know, but I admire them for doing so. Like most such survival stories, there were those who behaved heroically and those who focused solely on their own survival. There were even looters and tourists who came to gawk. But I think, underneath it all, this is a story about families, some who survived, and many who died, together."}, {"userName": "Cary Griffith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3401031-cary-griffith", "userReview": "I'm from the Twin Cities and I have been making the sojourn North since I was in the 9th grade (at that time, from Iowa). Tobies has always been associated with journeys north. While it's a mainstay of the Hinkley exit, perfectly appointed between the Twin Cities and Duluth, it doesn't have anything to do with the great fire of 1894. Which is why this book was so surprising and informative; I had heard of a great fire, but had no idea just how dramatic, deadly and tragic it ultimately was. Brown doesn an excellent job telling the story and must have done copious research. It reads well, but enough. You be the judge.\"Then all the living were gone, and dusk gave way to dark. The somber clouds of the afternoon began to break apart and drift away overhead. The bodies still piled by the trench lay on their backs, silent and still.

It\u2019s no secret I love disaster non-fiction and survival stories. An entire town fleeing a firestormnado apocalypse? Yes, please!But this one felt curiously flat and I\u2019m not sure why. A huge number of details were extrapolated (motivations, etc) from necessity, because the people died; usually that bothers me (I\u2019m glaring at you, Children\u2019s Blizzard) but here it seemed acceptable. Maybe because there were no \u201cher final thoughts were of her beloved brown cow\u201d or whatever (Children\u2019s Blizzard, you are a right mess.)This book seemed respectful, in a word, and the author wrote at some length of his reasons and research (thank you).Well, anyway. It made me afraid of several horrible ways to die that I had never before considered, so there is that. I love to be afraid of horrible ways to die.\u201cRespectful\u201d is the word that keeps coming to mind. There is no sense of gawking and rubbernecking at the tragedy, no shaming of the people who made all the wrong choices and died. Plenty of people made all the \u201cright\u201d choices and died, too. And we get a trace of that rare thing: closure. The author acknowledged, and dealt with, the aftermath of an enormous natural disaster in a time when phones were not yet invented. Survivors lurching around, shell-shocked and burned all over, hair and clothes gone. Their family, home, livelihood, health: gone.Again without shaming, the author addresses the 19th c treatment of burns and the slow, gruesome death that waited for most of these people who had already suffered so much.This is a personal topic for Mr Brown, which might influence the tone. His own grandfather had lived through the fires in Hinckley, as a child.

Coupled with 436 deaths and casualties probably double that, it is also a story of heroism and pathos. Brown provides backstories, much in the style of Erik Larson, that rivet the reader to the characters experiencing the events of that day in 1894, as well as giving us a tutorial on burn trauma, the psychology of emergency behavior, and the incidence of mental health problems after traumatic events. Most of it is based on what we know now in the 21st century, and when contrasted with what was known in the last decade of the 19th century we see the apocalyptic nature of the Hinckley Firestorm.Brown has relatives that died in or experienced this conflagration. He is the first member of his family to re-visit the place where it took place more than 120 years ago. Using historical records he was able to piece together a description of the chaos and the heroic rescue efforts of that day, and the search and burial efforts that stretched into weeks in its aftermath. I felt closely connected with the people described and my heart went out to them as Brown revealed the emotions that they were suffering through.I actually read through the end notes, and would recommend that other readers do the same. There are some very poignant conversations and quotes that the author uncovered during his research.

But it's not the \"five stars\" it might otherwise deserve because the history seems very likely to have been filled in. There can be no doubt that the fire happened and destroyed many lives. Yet there is a suspicious level of detail, including psychological detail. One person felt a knot in their stomach. Another wondered where so-and-so had gone. None of this was recorded in the moment. The nature of fire is that there are almost no contemporaneous sources left behind. This leaves the citations at the end of the book largely conversational recollections or memoirs recorded years after the fact. These were almost certainly blurred or filled in by the frailty of human memory calling back harrowing circumstances. The sources listed, and the manner of listing them, do not make it easy to attribute which one contained which narrative detail.The author created a narrative and presented it as chronological truth.

I had to go back to the Robber Barons, and Tycoons of the day for that answer. Nature, and the average person were to be exploited, drained, discarded and for them to just move on to the next opportunity to make more money. Nature and Humans be damned.The methods used to clear cut the virgin forests left millions of tons of fuel to be consumed; and it was consumed at a horrible cost.It really brought home to me, how important it is to live in harmony with Nature and to act respectful and responsibly to her.

Without the railroads passing through these towns, many more lives would have been lost. The personal stories gathered and told are particularly poignant and often horrific, compassionately offered. Over 20 years, nearly all of the white pine forests in Minnesota and Wisconsin were obliterated, either by logging or fire, leaving behind ruined soil that still has not recovered from the catastrophe.
