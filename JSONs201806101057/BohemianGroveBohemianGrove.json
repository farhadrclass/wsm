I know it can't be an easy thing to write a book, and I appreciate the work authors put into their writing. However, I'm completely baffled by all the 4- and 5-star reviews this books has received, as it is probably one of the worst books I've read, both in editing and plot execution.I can easily overlook a typo or two - nobody's perfect. However, when the third word of a book is misspelled, then misspelled again in the next sentence, or when the protagonist is described as having \"griped\" a sink in the second paragraph, I just, ugh... I almost put it down after that first page, but I soldiered on, figuring it had to get better. Nope. Sentences are missing words, incorrect tenses are used, commas are placed willy-nilly or not at all, random apostrophes are just hanging around, and capitalization is missing from proper nouns. Words are repeated ad nauseum in single paragraphs; there is no reason to use the word \"tea\" four times in four lines. The same words are used over and over to describe things. Jack smells musky, William smells musky, William's breath smells musky, the forest smells musky. Are there no other smells in Bohemian Grove?! We get lines like, \"She kicking herself internally for being so dense,\" \"They rode the entire way in silence and he guessed it was partly due to his lack of keeping up with the conversation,\" and \"The air became ambiguous.\" Continuity is also a problem. On one page, Jack's nose is broken rather violently (his face \"explodes\") by one of the \"kidnappers\" to stop him from following after Carter and the other \"kidnapper,\" while on the very next page, Carter wakes up (after being chloroformed), and everyone is in the same room. Why the nose-breaking, then?! This felt like a first draft that neither the author nor anyone else proofread before publishing.As for the plot: it had potential. An alien race that helped shape the course of humanity? Good. A religious faction that wants to keep the public from finding out about the aliens in order to preserve religious institutions? Super. Unfortunately, the book spent far too much time focusing on an insipid love triangle than it did fleshing out the alien/religion idea. Carter gets all tingly around Jack. Carter gets all tingly around William. Carter realizes she's falling in love with Jack. Carter's making out with William. Maybe she just got confused as to who she was with because they smelled the same. Musky.This was just an absolute miss for me. Sorry."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20227123-cathy", "userReview": "I received this book from Goodreads first reads.As I was reading Bohemian Grove, I felt the more I read the less I knew what was going on with the characters. Thus, I believe there could have been more time devoted to character development. The lack of this has resulted in two dimensional unlikable characters. I realize this is the first book in a trilogy and hopefully the characters will get more developed and able to deal with whatever is thrown at them. But for now, they are presented as weak, unimaginative, confused and panicked to the point of being frozen. I felt I had missed a chapter at around the 149th page when the main character shows up all of a sudden without a real explanation as to how it happened. I don't know the reason for such a rushed story, but I think a bit more explanation to what and why things are happening would be a great asset to the book even if more pages have to be added."}, {"userName": "Reeda Booke", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11260161-reeda-booke", "userReview": "I have no idea how this book got so many 5 star reviews. I got halfway through it and was bored to tears! Halfway through a book and all I got out of it was the main character, Carter, and the googley eyes she makes at two different men. Reminded me of the teenage angst of \"Twilight\" but between an Anunnaki alien and a human. The conspiracy with the Anunnaki and the Vaticates seemed to be more of a secondary plot than the main idea. I don't know if the story would have picked up if I had kept reading, but I just couldn't take it anymore and deleted the book."}, {"userName": "Jules", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4868121-jules", "userReview": "[And just when you think Jack and Carter are perfect for each other in every way, we meet William. He's mysterious, sexy, has answers to some of Carter's questions, and she's drawn to him in a way she doesn't quite understand. And you want to hate him, you really do. For the sake of the threat he represents to Carter/Jack as a couple, you at least want to seriously dislike the man, but there's something innately likable about him.

Future readers, this will get you on the edge of your seat and ready to enjoy the ride on the Bohemian Grove roller coaster. Scholars of real ancient history (readers of Sitchin and the like) and belief systems will want to take notes so that they can research the material referenced. One of the beauties of this novel is that the scholarship references are perfectly woven into the thrilling story line. It is very difficult to pull that off, yet this writer did it.Of course; a great novel not only has twists and turns, but also a romantic element. The dynamics of the characters involved here plays out very well. Readers will be looking for the rest of the trilogy to come out yesterday just to see what happens with these relationships.ETs, suspense, and romance; what more can a reader want? If you like any type of novel; this book should be in your library. Great work! I look forward to the next one in this series."}, {"userName": "Masoud Eghbalyan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18761759-masoud-eghbalyan", "userReview": "I love the characters and the idea that there's something going on with ancient aliens. I'm a huge fan of the history channel and was happy to see a fun story based on this theory. I also love the connection the author brings between the ancient alien theory and religion (Vaticates). *spoiler alert* I can't wait to read the next book and see who Carter, the main character, ends up with from her love triangle. There's a lot of deep meanings in the book that are hidden that I really enjoyed and can't wait to get more."}, {"userName": "Melissa B", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7581245-melissa-b", "userReview": "Won this through a Goodreads Giveaway.

I was initially expecting a solid read with rather clearly defined good and evil elements. I must say I was delighted to find a story with real depth and outstanding plot lines. Good and evil are not so clear cut here.Carter, the lead character, discovers she is an alien, an Anunnaki, a race that has been shepherding along human development, even human evolution. On the other side are the Vaticates, who are the defenders of faith and religion, bent on destroying the Anunnaki.Essentially Carter and her friend Jack are kidnapped by the Anunnaki and taken to Bohemian Grove. There Carter learns more about her heritage and how very special she is, to both sides of this argument. Carter becomes entangled in a love triangle with Jack and William. William is an Anunnaki, to whom she is very much drawn. Jibril, leader of the Vaticates, tells Jack that Carter should beware of William, because he claims William can extract the information the Anunnaki from Carter even if she ends up dead.There are many altercations in the book. It is very fast paced and it really makes the reader pay attention. Is either side in this really in the right? Would the new knowledge put an end to faith and religion? Even if so, does this justify the genocide the Vaticate is apparently perpetrating? It becomes crystal clear that Carter isn't being told everything. No doubt some of that which is being held back is actually vital - to her survival and to the survival of humanity.If you like being made to think, as I do, then this book is a must read. I am definitely looking forward to the next book!"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3123087-amy", "userReview": "* I was given this book free, in exchange for an honest review*Wow. Another hit for TM Williams. This book has it all, romance, mystery, and conspiracy too!! From the beginning of this book, it\u2019s full throttle! Who really built the Egyptian pyramids? What about Atlantis? Sure man had a hand in all that, but was it solely man who created them? Now what if alien beings came here to Earth and helped, they gave us technology to advance and some stayed with us. Passing their traits down, generation after generation after generation. Enter Carter your average woman, with a full life of friends and her dad. She lost her mom at an early age. Then she learns that maybe, there is more to life. Especially her life. That\u2019s she not truly all human. That she is the key to bring another humanoid species here, again. But there is another group that do NOT want her to succeed and they will do anything and everything to stop Carter and her fellow beings. She is spoon fed the truth, little by little they give her information. They train her, they are all around her at all times. She even fines love; in an unlikely place. This book makes you think. I had to look up some stuff, because I\u2019d never heard it before. This is a GREAT thing!! This book makes you wonder, what if\u2026"}, {"userName": "Angela Alvandian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19488940-angela-alvandian", "userReview": "It's about time someone wrote an ancient astronaut fiction story. Everyone is into vampires and warewolves but there is something new and interesting with the ancient astronaut theory. The only thing I wished was that somehow it indicated that this was a trilogy when I bought it. The good thing the author did not leave it with too big of a cliffhanger. I definately am anxious to read the next book. I read this book in one sitting. The beginning starts off pulling you in and there is a little bit of slowness in the first half of the book but the it quckly builds up and is a page turner. I could not put it down. I like that the author was able to give each character their own \"voice\". I am a huge Jibril fan and his character is so fun that I would not mind reading a book on just him. I hope we see more of him in the second and third book. Johns character was a fun surprise and am looking forward to learning more about William, because we don't learn enough about him in book 1.I am happy the author put in a love triangle because it opens up the demographic and adds an element to sci-fi that isn't normally there. It's not your typical love triangle either because there's a sci-fi mystic ther as well. All in all this is a great read and I think the series all together will be one worth buying a hard copy for.

I wish that her next book was out now so I could continue Carters journey. T.M. Williams has a way of describing the scenes that makes me feel like I am really there and can see everything around me.
