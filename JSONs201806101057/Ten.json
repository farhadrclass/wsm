We've got dead bodies piling up and I don't know about you, but I don't exactly want to be next.wait, how, exactly, is this like lord of the flies? how is this like an allegory of society where kids succumb to their bestial impulses once the moral codes of civilization have been removed? this is about one person's revenge fantasy come to life. did you only read the cliffs notes??it's one of those books where we figure stuff out before the characters,particularly the heroine, who is too dopey to realize whose journal she is reading even when all the clues are right in front of her. even though said journal is another example of forced narrative, because the way it is written is bananas. \"the girl,\" \"the boy,\" \"my friend,\"\"that jerk from PE\"... which is great if you are writing a mystery novel and you want to hide your secrets, but no teenage girl writes like that in her journal. and dopey-heroine is encouraged by male love-interest to voice her thoughts because her \"comebacks\" are so clever and sharp. they are not. they are just dopey.this is definitely plot-driven rather than character-driven. no one seems more than theatrically afraid of what is happening, and by the end, it just comes across as blas\u00e9:oh, another one. shrug.BTW, i would love a YA retelling of clue, please.but, no - i'm not gonna bitch any more. this is fine, for the younger reader, the teens who don't have a million books on their shelves and are just looking for something quick and unchallenging.don't listen to me, i am old and stale."}, {"userName": "Evie", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4335276-evie", "userReview": "I think I need a cold shower, cup of hot choco and a teddy bear to snuggle up with.This book destroyed my mental stability.Suck on a thumb much?"}, {"userName": "Grace (BURTSBOOKS)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63164992-grace-burtsbooks", "userReview": "[ Okay, listen, I\u2019m not going to go into a big rant about heteronormativity and all the problematic messages the romance of this book sends but let me just say, the two romantic interests being the only people to survive is cheap as fuck.

It should have been ominous. It should have kept Meg from turning the next page.Not so much.\nThe word (review) was my own addition. Who ever listens when told to stop doing something? The words \"keep out\" aren't much different from waving a red cape in front of an angry bull. It only dares us to charge right in.You know, I can't even fault her for doing it. If people were dropping like flies all around me (this is not a spoiler...I will try not to go much further than what the summary is going to tell you anyway), I'd probably be looking around for clues myself. Either that, or crafting a fine raft made out of household items to get myself off the damn wretched island. Either/or. It's a toss-up. I'd probably leave the sleuthing to the experts and try to run from the crazy killer.\n\nVengeance is mine.\n\nIf you've read any reviews on this book already, you'll have figured out that the inspiration was Agatha Christie's classic And Then There Were None. Since we can liken Ten to a re-telling of ATTWN, I'll say it wasn't a bad effort. The murder scenarios might not have been as crazy or scary as I would have preferred, but I give credit to the author for tackling the project and pulling it off well enough. In cases like this, I'd love to see what kind of notes the author must have been taking in order to keep track of everything.The first 25% or so of the book felt a little dead behind the eyes. All of the teens arrived conveniently on the island (because sure...all 10 of them lucked out and were able to go - what a fabulous coincidence!) and some of the mix-n-mingle part of the book had me skimming. Not that it was boring; I just wasn't in the mood for learning about 10 characters who might most likely die. It's probably not a good idea to skim anything that could be laying groundwork for a murder mystery, but I like to take chances. If you have read ATTWN before, you'll sort of know at least part of what's going on, although there are a few twists to change it up just a little.I'm also going to go out there and say that there had to be a nod to the t.v. show Harper's Island in here as well. The show HI was sort of a very loose interpretation also of Christie's book, except more updated for the new generation of horror movie fans. I smiled at the name Henry Island because that was the name of the lead character from HI. Although, I'd almost wondered if that was a placeholder name because everywhere else in the book, the island was called by another name. A few of the character similarities also echoed the show. NOTE : BTW...if you get the chance, get a hold of a DvD copy or stream this show on Netflix. It's even more fun if you watch the show with other people and place bets on who the killer is.As well, it was as if every major horror movie that had come from the past couple of decades (especially those appealing to teens) had been picked/borrowed from just a little. One major scene was almost dead on identical to a scene from the movie The Ring. I think this must have been the author's way of paying homage to what has come before because both The Ring and Scream were jokingly referenced in the book.There's only a few small complaints about an otherwise decent book :I hated the way the main female character defended her abusive friend (she was so blinded to the truth that it PAINED me).I thought the gay/racist comments were unnecessary. Making the comments okay because a character was allowed to have a comeback in order to confirm that the jokes were wrong sort of is an \"eh\" factor for me when the comments really didn't need to be there in the first place. If the story was about bullying or racism, etc. fine. But the comments were just random chatter in the middle of a murder mystery. It was a very small blip though in a conversation, so I don't think any ill intent was meant by the blip.I could have lived without the \"killer vs. victim\" scene where he or she (not spoiling of course) stands there and recaps their kills. Every friggin movie and t.v. show has this scene. Is this the standard? There has to be another way to bring the missing details into place without having to do it this way?Final Analysis : I think this would be a fun read for anyone who hasn't had the chance to read many murder mysteries and would prefer to be eased into the genre with something that's not too taxing. If this had been one of the first murder mysteries I'd ever read, I might have had more positive vibes about Ten. My average rating is only because I've seen this particular story done better before, but not because I think this book was bad or boring.If you are new to the world of murder mysteries, I'd say give to give Ten a shot. It's murder-mystery-light-beer : great taste, less filling (the book is fairly short and easy to read). But at least it's not incredibly scary or gory. If you can handle Hunger Games, you are perfectly fine to tackle this book."}, {"userName": "Blythe", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5206717-blythe", "userReview": "Vengeance is mine; I will repay.For the time when their foot shall slide. For the day of their disaster is near.And their doom comes swiftly.\nTen is the story of ten (ha! Get it? Because the book is called Ten? Ah. I'll just stop now...) teenagers who are all invited to a secret house party on a secluded island over the course of a three-day weekend. Expecting to have a fun, drunken and hormonally stereotypical time at the party, best friends Meg and Minnie decide to go, despite Meg's reservations. However, as the two arrive at the secluded island and equally as secluded party house, things begin to go awry, and not just because Meg's crush, whom she cancelled her homecoming date with, happened to be at the party. After watching a video depicting random, seemingly insignificant scenes, ending with a chilling message, \"Vengeance is mine.\", the teenagers start getting picked off one by one by an unknown killer, and at this party, there's no one you can trust. I'll be the first to admit that I expected very little from Ten going into it. At first, before its publication, Ten had received raving reviews, and was at my top priority ARC list for quite a while. But then, after its publication, Ten started receiving many two and one star ratings, some from very trusted friends of mine, and my anticipation grew less and less to the point where I went into this expecting to be frustrated and to let my snark out with Ten, only to, in the end, be genuinely surprised by it in almost every way imaginable. What I originally expected Ten to be upon reading its synopsis months ago was a fun read that would resemble a campy eighties' slasher flick, but afterwards, judging by the negative reviews, I expected it to be a predictable, melodramatic and boring read. This instance, among many, is one where I should have gone with my initial expectation, because let me tell you, I had a whole lot of fun with this campy little book. You may not know this about me, but I love horror. I read it; I watch it; I love it; I live it. I grew up reading Goosebumps by R.L. Stine (they are practically the basis behind my love for horror), watching Nightmare on Elm Street as a child (I may or may not own the Collector's Edition with all eight movies), and reading Stephen King as a teenager (to this day, he remains as my favorite author of all-time, and I highly doubt he will ever be replaced). As a horror fan, setting is everything to me. Small town, carnival, or, in Ten's case, secluded island - whatever the setting is, if you manage to get it and its atmosphere down, I'm putty in your knife-wielding hands. And that's where I feel Gretchen McNeil hit a home run with Ten. Immediately in Ten, we're brought into a big storm, crashing the waves around Henry Island onto the coast, swaying the ferry carrying two party-goers in for the weekend of their lives or deaths (I had to), and I just felt like I was there. That feeling remained throughout the entire novel, and just made for an incredibly creepy and atmospheric read. I felt like I was there with Meg, slowly putting together the clues as to who the killer was, leading up to a reveal that I definitely did not see coming, and more importantly, I felt for the characters. I felt for Meg. I felt for the other party-goers (well, most of them. For some I was just counting down the pages until they'd meet their death), and, shockingly enough, I felt for the killer. McNeil does a superb job at setting the scene for the readers, and having readers feel for the characters they don't want to feel for. The killer and red-herrings were, for me, difficult to spot, I found the deaths to be cleverly thought out, and I kept changing my theory as to who the killer was throughout the entire novel. Whether or not Ten is simply a loose retelling of And Then There Were None or a complete and total rip-off is unbeknownst to me, as I have not yet read the latter, but what I can say is that if you haven't yet read And Then There Were None, with Ten, you're in for a shocking and chilling three-day weekend at Henry Island."}, {"userName": "Kate (GirlReading)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29599654-kate-girlreading", "userReview": "3.75* I am so conflicted on how I felt about this book!! On one hand, I LOVED it. It was gripping, heart pounding, addictive and so intense, a lot more so than I'd expected. It genuinely had me freaked out at points and kept me guessing until the last page which is everything I want in a thriller and something I rarely find. Yes it was incredibly cliche but in such a fun way, that it didn't take away from the enjoyment (although there was a questionable moment when a couple decided the perfect time to have a full on make out session, was after finding a house full of murderer bodies because, of course?...) On the on the hand, Ten was utterly littered with ableism and specifically ableist language, which was so incredibly disappointing. I understand that it was written in 2012, when people maybe weren't so understanding but oh my gosh, the ableist language was heavy. The cast was pretty diverse, out of the ten teens a minor character was Samoan, two were Asian and a main character black. (Although I'm not in a position to say wether or not the representation was harmful in anyway.) Another main character was described as having crippling anxiety and bipolar disorder but I personally wasn't a fan of the way she was portrayed at all. She was a pretty nasty character, which was consistently blamed on her mental health, which was more than frustrating. So yes, conflicted is definitely how I'd describe my feeling on Ten. I flew through it, couldn't put it down and I can't tell you how refreshing it was to read a YA thriller where I hadn't guessed 'whodunit' within the first few pages. Unfortunately, I can't ignore the blatant and fairly regular ableist language used and therefore can't give it as high of a rating as I would have, had that not been there. I'm definitely intrigued to read more from Gretchen McNeil, as (other than the ableism mentioned) I loved her addictive writing style and I just hope whatever I read next from her, isn't quite so heavy on the ableist language!"}, {"userName": "Jill Heather", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3097045-jill-heather", "userReview": "Have you read And Then There Were None?

Seth MacFarlane cribbed the plot from Agatha Christie, sure, but it was still a damn funny parody. In Ten, Gretchen McNeil takes that exact same well-worn story of horror and revenge, but adds nothing new to it really.The only thing this book doesn\u2019t lack for is strong writing, McNeil\u2019s White Rock House is the quintessential house of horrors, isolated, foreboding, all bleak lines and sharp angles. A perfect roost for a would-be murderer. But the actual plot, though, I\u2019m being very diplomatic when I say almost the entirety of the book consists of nothing but a string of horror movie cliches. There are the ten dinner\u2026 er weekend guests, each one besides protagonist Meg and love interest T.J. suffering from ever worsening character flaws that just beg for them to be offed for their bad behavior. Meg, and to a lesser extent T.J., is the saint whose flaw is being too nice and caring and thus deserve to survive a little longer than the first couple of victims so she can discover the identity of the murderer and rant about how unfair and crazy the killer\u2019s entire plan is. And since the whole thing is entirely by the books, deciding whether Meg and T.J. survive or not was one of the easiest things I\u2019ve ever done. But I wouldn\u2019t be nearly as frustrated with Ten if the characters weren\u2019t so genre savvy, if they weren\u2019t so acutely aware of all these horror tropes, yet still insist on falling into all these cliches anyway. Dead man walking Nathan points out how the black character\u2019s usually the first one to die in a horror film, but that is like the only trope this book successfully avoids. There\u2019s the initial staged suicide that leaves everyone wondering whether there really is a murderer, or if it was just an accident. Yeah, after the previous, I don\u2019t know, three or four creepy and suspicious scenes, I\u2019d at least look into it, but no. Don\u2019t know what these guys are doing. And after the second death, it becomes incredibly frustrating, like McNeil has this checklist of horror tropes and she\u2019s just checking them off as she goes along. Mistrust and suspicions fall on each other Lord of the Flies style. Check. Details about the killer are slowly revealed through intentional breadcrumbs. Check. People are idiots and wander off to their deaths. Check. At this point, I feel like I\u2019m reading a handbook on how to write horror rather than an actual horror novel, and I\u2019m not even spoiling the massive cliche of an ending.Maybe the by the books plot could\u2019ve been saved by some actually decent characters, but that didn\u2019t happen, so I\u2019ll never know. Most of the characters, Vivian, Minnie, Kenny, are, no surprise, written as completely unlikable tools since they deserve to die, basically, but even the ones who arguably didn\u2019t, Gunner, Kumiko, I really wish they hadn\u2019t been written with such flat characterizations because it seems to me like this book is more concerned with who did what with whom during Prom, even if that is important to the plot, than fleshing out the players. None of them were really all that interesting. Even Meg ends up being such a weak and needy character and T.J. such a blank slate that the ending, rather than being emotional, fell really flat. I\u2019m more pissed at the way everything (predictably) went down than who the killer was, what his motives were, or which characters survived the ordeal.I guess what I\u2019m saying is that I got nothing new out of this book. The plot ran off a formula, the characters fell flat, and the ending, this isn\u2019t my first horror show, I\u2019ve seen it all before.Tldr: Just watch And Then There Were Fewer.

Minnie and Meg (Why both beginning with M though?! That was so confusing in the beginning!) I thought made a really good 'best-friend' pair with their conflicting personalities and harboured issues. That being said, out of ten suspects, the audience automatically focused their attention on four, maybe five characters, as everyone else was severely under developed. I was glad when the filler characters got killed off because it meant I didn't have to keep flipping back to remember their generic names and instant-spray personalities. The fact that it's teenagers dying instead of adults automatically makes this book a little more morbid and upsetting in the senselessness of young lives ending too soon. The reason's behind the deaths seemed a little shallow, but then again, they were all just regular self absorbed kids so it would be a little far fetched if they were all secretly gangstas and killers who actually 'deserved' to die. It was a shame that was no correlation made to the 10 Indians rhyme from the original story, I was really looking forward to an inventive take on that, but I guess if you know you can't do it justice, don't bother at all right?Like I said, I thought this book was alright.

The real key is to try and strike a balance between staying true and faithful to the plot while adding something new and exciting in the mix. Some books manage to pull I off (Stone Field, This Dark Endeavor, and The Madman\u2019s Daughter, just to name a few). Other retellings completely crash and burn on arrival (Great, Lock & Mori, and Winterspell). And then there\u2019s that special category of retellings. Retellings that are so offensive and blatantly disregarding of the original that when a reader of the original tries to read the book, they literally become angry. Unfortunately for me (but fortunately for you, because of the review you\u2019ll be getting), this book falls into that category. If Dame Agatha Christie ever got her hands on this book, she\u2019d probably want to set a big-ass bonfire and burn all existing copies. Despite what the cover and the blurb fails tell you, this is a retelling of Agatha Christie\u2019s mystery novel And Then There Were None. The plot? Ten people (in this case teenagers), are invited to spend the weekend at an island, and one by one they all die. It\u2019s obvious that someone is out to get them, but who? And why? So before I let loose on the entire book, let\u2019s acknowledge the one sole positive thing about this book (there was only one, and I\u2019m being generous here). This book is incredibly diverse. We have two characters with mental illness (bipolar and depression), an African American, not one but two (!) Asian MC\u2019s and one Pacific Islander (which is exceedingly rare in a YA book, so props to the author). The fact that the author made it seem natural and not forced was a plus.Now onto the negative which was... pretty much everything about this novel. Probably the least offensive thing about this book was that every single MC was a stereotype. Not a racial stereotype, mind you (if that were the case this book would be getting zero stars). I\u2019m talking about the typical, high school stereotypes that we see in movies, books, and TV about high school. We have a type-A personality bitch, a handsome, airheaded surfer dude, a manic pixie dream girl with colored hair (because it\u2019s edgy), the massive football player with a heart of gold, the Queen Bee, the quiet, mousy one, the All-American golden boy... you get the idea. It felt like I was reading a novelized version of an early 2000s teen drama on the WB. It got to the point that I had to flip back to the front of the book to see when this was published, because I legitimately thought it was published in the early 2000s (it was published in 2012). It was mildly annoying, but didn\u2019t make me pissed off. What pissed me off was the fact that the author took one of the greatest murder/psychological mysteries of all time with memorable morally ambiguous characters, a chilling atmosphere, an ingenious plot, and boiled it down to nothing more than two teenagers lusting after each other. This is how the author honored the greatest mystery writer of all time. I can\u2019t fucking believe it. So buckle your seatbelts, and let\u2019s go down this long, winding, disbelieving road of a literary re-telling gone horribly wrong. Millie and Meg are friends, They\u2019ve been invited to this wicked-cool party all by their little selves over the long vacation weekend. They decide to go. Well, there are other guests invited, and one of them happens to be T.J. Miller. Thomas Jefferson Miller, to be exact. He\u2019s handsome, he\u2019s gorgeous, he\u2019s athletic, what could possibly go wrong?Well, the little fact that Minnie and Meg are both in love with him might be the problem. And since Minnie\u2019s mental, it makes it a big problem; one that must be repeated continuously throughout the entire book.\n\u201dShe had to get over him. Had to. He was a player- as Minnie brought up repeatedly- they were going to college a thousand miles apart, and her best friend was in love with him. She had to move on.\u201d\nBecause he\u2019s SOOOOO handsome; he\u2019s the best thing since Swiss cheese.\n\u201dHis dimples- the left one slightly deeper than the right- taunted her. So many times she\u2019d dreamed about running her fingers over them, feeling the soft indentations with her fingers, then tracing the strong, square line of his chin. \u201d\nFollowing the plot of Christie\u2019s novel, one by one the guests begin to die. Meg being the special snowflake that she is, tries to help them with her mad computer skills. It almost works. But Meg isn\u2019t exactly thinking about that in the moment, BECAUSE T.J. \n\u201dShe felt a collective sigh of relief, including someone\u2019s breath against her cheek. Not just someone, T.J. So close that she could have turned her face and their lips would have touched...Stop it. Of all the inappropriate times to think about kissing T.J., this had to be the worst.\u201d\nYes, it is most inappropriate.The remaining houseguests putter along and half-heartedly try to find the suspect. Minnie continues to stew because she thinks something romantical is going on between Meg and T.J. Meg denies it but continues to pine after him. More puttering along ensues as more people die. Meg and T.J., who are not only still alive but special snowflakes deemed worthy enough to search the island, traipse along in the rain searching for the killer. But instead of doing that, what do they do?\n\u201dFaster than Meg could react he reached down and gave her a quick kiss on the lips, then whirled around and headed back up the hill.Several thoughts filled Meg\u2019s head simultaneously.Number one- she was quite possibly going to pass out from joy.Number two- had he meant to kiss her? Had it been a mistake? No, that was silly. How could it possibly have been a mistake unless she was trying to lick something off her face?\u201d\nSERIOUSLY? The houseguests are \ndying.\nThis is NOT the time to be thinking about whether he kissed or licked your face.But wait. IT GETS BETTER.Two of the houseguests disappear, and once again Meg and T.J. go out in the rain and search for them. They happen upon the only other house on the island besides theirs. And low and behold, they find not one, not two, but FOUR dead bodies (two are partygoers and the others are the people living in the house their searching). So what do these two do after finding four dead bodies? WHAT DO THEY DO, YOU ASK??!!!!\n\u201dShe unbuttoned his coat and had a hand up his sweater before she could even register what she was doing. His skin was hot and smooth, and she wanted to feel every inch of it, right then and there regardless of what was going on around them. Or perhaps because of it? Meg had no idea. She only thought of T.J. and how desperately she wanted him. She didn\u2019t care about anything else- not the murders not being stranded on the island not the strange writing on the bathroom mirror that seemed oddly similar...\u201d\nTHEY MAKE OUT AND HAVE A STRIPTEASE. YES, YOU READ THAT RIGHT. BECAUSE WHEN YOU FIND FOUR DEAD BODIES, ONE THAT WAS BLUDGEONED, AND THREE THAT WERE SHOT, YOU MAKE OUT WITH THE NEAREST MALE SPECIMAN NEAR YOU. WHAT THE FRACKITY FRACK FRACK WERE THEY THINKING. THERE ARE FOUR DEAD BODIES.\nAt this point, I thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse than that (spoiler; it does). Then we get to the part where the actual killer and motive are revealed. And to be perfectly honest, compared with the motives of the killer in the original source, it was quite petty and kind of \u2018meh\u2019. The methods of killing, and how they were decided, were laughable and the villain itself was whiny, selfish, and frankly, unbelievable. At this point, it was going to take a miracle from Jesus to impress me, and that didn\u2019t happen. And then we get to the ending of the book. Spoiler: both Meg and T.J. survive (in accordance with all retellings of Christie\u2019s tale cause let\u2019s face it; all the characters dying is kind of depressing). As they\u2019re standing there in all their teenage hormonal glory, they reflect on their harrowing experiences and the lessons they\u2019ve learned. \u2018This is it,\u2019 I thought to myself. \u2018This is the chance for the book to redeem itself, to show that these characters are more than just hormonal little brats; they can reflect on their experiences. What could possibly go wrong?\n\u201dBut as nightmarish as the whole weekend had been as horrifying and painful and life-altering in a way that even years of therapy wouldn\u2019t be able to cure her of, it had done one beautiful thing: It had brought her and T.J. together.\u201d\nARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Needless to say, I hated this book. It crapped all over Agatha Christie\u2019s beloved classic and watered it down to nothing more than two hormonal, lovestruck teenagers. It was a travesty that made me boiling mad and heading immediately for my beloved copy of And Then There Were None (and the masterful TV miniseries to go along with it) for some damage control. If you love the original, stay far away from this book. If you\u2019re not, stay far away from this book. It\u2019s not worth your time."}, {"userName": "Brad Sells", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3365948-brad-sells", "userReview": "I can't even begin to explain how much I love TEN! TEN is a fast-paced thriller, with jump-out-of-your-seat moments, secrets that will shock you, and an ending that will terrify you until the very last page. I should start off by saying that i read TEN in one night: start to finish. I couldn't put it down! McNeil composed a mystery novel in which all of the events in this book actually made sense. She did a terrific job with this novel, and I would recommend it to anybody -- mystery lover or not!Our main protagonist Meg is a very likeable character. She's always there for her friends, always wants to help out, and is always sharp on the tack. Especially when it comes to murders around her. I never once found her to be annoying or idiotic, like some characters are in books that feature murders. Minnie, on the other hand, is a very completely different story. She's quick-tempered and will push anybody aside to get what she wants. Minnie is definitely not the best of friends in YA literature.And the whole thing with a serial killer murdering these ten teens on an island cut off from the rest of the world . . . mind equals blown. If you don't know, TEN is an inspired story by Agatha Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. I thought that Gretchen did a great job at tackling that very popular mystery novel, and I wanted more and more after I read the last page! Fantastic!THE. ENDING. No spoilers here, but GUYS. WOW. My jaw was literally open for the entire final fifty pages. McNeil had me on the edge of my seat; I was even checking over my shoulder to make sure the killer wasn't standing behind me! Love it when a book makes me do that! And like I said before, everything makes sense in the end! Didn't see a bunch things coming in this novel.One last thing before I end this review: somebody in Hollywood, PLEASE buy the movie rights to TEN! This would make a killer movie! (no pun intended) Thrilling, captivating and scary; TEN deserves to be on the big screen!Overall, TEN is one of my favorite novels of 2012! If you want a novel with secrets and betrayals, shocking moments and terrifying conclusions, TEN is definitely the book you should buy!"}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605366-carrie", "userReview": "I read this.

Now I kind of wish I\u2019d read the Agatha Christie first, and not completely spoiled myself with Ten, as I have it on good authority that the original is brilliant. Which is my roundabout way of saying that this was not brilliant. But not terrible either. Being unaware of the plot twists made me curious enough to read Ten quickly, though I suspect if you\u2019ve read Christie\u2019s novel you\u2019ll find it far less compelling. There\u2019s a great, creepy atmosphere in the setting and use of the elements -(okay, so the storm was an obvious choice, but still, it works) and McNeil does a decent job of injecting some unease into the story from the get-go. Everything feels slightly wrong, off kilter, as Meg and her best friend embark on what\u2019s meant to be a weekend of youthful debauchery. And truth be told, I kind of love the teen-slasher-flick vibe, where you know it\u2019s going to be slightly be ridiculous, but find yourself sucked in by the mounting tension anyway. Seem I can\u2019t resist a bit of \u201cOMG the power\u2019s out!\u201d style panic. I had the killer pegged fairly quickly, although to McNeil\u2019s credit she threw me off the scent a couple of times with some well executed red herrings. That said, there are also some broad hints as to why the killings might be happening, and I was surprised it took Meg so long to cop on. Coupled with a few clunky horror allusions which weren\u2019t necessary to dial up the tension, the novel at times feels like it\u2019s trying too hard to hammer home the scariness. I think this could have been demonstrated more subtly through stronger writing, as opposed to simply signposting the moments we\u2019re supposed to find tense with obvious, telling statements. The writing in general felt a little like first person narration dressed up in third-person. There were some awkward sections of exposition that seemed better suited to Meg\u2019s internal voice. Given that there\u2019s also a relatively large cast of characters (ten! Surprise!) for a short novel, there\u2019s not a lot of time for deep characterisation. That means that we get amplified, shorthand versions of each character, their personalities cranked up as loud as possible for maximum impact in an abbreviated amount of time. It\u2019s not completely successful either. I found myself briefly thinking \u2019who the heck is Lori again?, which somewhat lessens the effect of the later scenes. Also, the \u201csilver lining\u201d mentioned at the end of the novel? Seriously? No. I\u2019m willing to suspend all manner of belief in terms of the killer\u2019s action and motivations, but I still expect realistic responses from the characters. And the whole \u201clook on the bright side!\u201d element of the ending really annoyed me. Not that I\u2019m opposed to that particular eventuality, just that it seemed distasteful to plonk it down it right there in the aftermath of a murderous rampage. Gripes with the execution aside, this was actually pretty diverting and kept me turning pages quickly."}, {"userName": "Lindsay Cummings", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729981-lindsay-cummings", "userReview": "sooo good and creepy.

It reminded me a lot of old school YA, the horror/thriller stories of my own youth. The style is more Christoper Pike (and ya'll know I love Pike) than R.L. Stine, with teens actually behaving in a teen manner. I was a bit afraid that this book would end up watered down and that only one or two people would die off screen, but nope, McNeil brings the horror! I was thrilled to pick up this title at BEA because I had heard the buzz about it being based on Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None, because even though I hadn't read the Christie book I was familiar with the plot.Don't worry though, this isn't a regurgitation of And Then There Were None. It's more Scream than Masterpiece Theater, not that I don't love me some Masterpiece Theater but sometimes I just want to be scared out of my mind.And this book delivers that. The author personally recommends reading this book during a thunderstorm, which would definitely set the tone, but I read this mostly at my well-lit work place (it was raining off and on outside though) and I still found myself startled by a mirror while reading. Yup, I managed not to scream, but it was a close thing. I work with the elderly, so screaming is not recommended. I would love to see YA swing back to thrillers, because that is still my go-to genre anytime I need to get out of a reading slump (I love apocalypses, ya'll, but I can only read so many in a row before needing therapy).For me this is a Five Star, Midnight Book Read simply because it really did have me up until the midnight hour- I had finished all but the last two chapters when a rainstorm woke me up and I knew that I had to finish the book right then and there! And yes, even though I came back from BEA with more books that I can probably read this year, I'll still go out and get McNeil's other book."}, {"userName": "Lexi-304", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40080783-lexi-304", "userReview": "I honestly didn't see that coming AT ALL!

I didn't want him to be the killer thought because I thought they were really cute together! Plus, I loved Kumiko... She was rude and seemed to be one of the first to realize there was a murderer among like the 8 of them. One of my favourite parts that I can recall is when the 5 of them were searching each floor together for the killer, Gunner and Minnie went together into a room I believe while Kumiko was by herself and T.J. was with Meg. Meg went into the bathroom and saw a piece of paper, the last diary entry in Claire's journal. Then there was a gunshot, at that time I thought it was either Minnie or T.J.
