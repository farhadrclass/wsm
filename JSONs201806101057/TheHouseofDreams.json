The House of Dreams deals with an interesting part of WWII history that I didn't know about, and for that reason alone it was worth reading. This novel has a couple of timelines. The first one takes place in 2000, and focuses on an interview between young journalist Sophie and an elderly artist named Gabriel Lambert who immigrated to the US from France during WWII. The second timeline focuses on Gabriel's life in Marseille in 1940-41. As a backdrop to Gabriel's story, the author uses the American Relief Center which was led by Varian Fry, an American journalist. The ARC had charged itself with getting artists and intellectuals out of France soon after the beginning of the Nazi occupation. Seemingly, this was a complex operation, made more difficult because there was real resistance to the initiative from the US government. The House of Dreams makes for a mixture of real history and people, and fictional characters with their own secrets and complexities. At times, it all became a bit messy and meandering, but mostly I enjoyed reading about this period of history through Gabriel's fictionalized story. It did help that Gabriel was an interesting character with a complex web of secrets that haunted him throughout his life. And it's hard not to like Sophie who turns out to have her own personal reasons for wanting to learn more about Gabriel's story. Despite the topic, it is a fairly light and fast read. It didn't knock my socks off, but I'm glad I read it -- I learned a bit of history and I was driven to know what happened to the characters in the end. Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for an opportunity to read an advance copy."}, {"userName": "Marilyn C.", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8170584-marilyn-c", "userReview": "I received an ARC of this book from Goodreads and Thomas Dunne Books. Thank you to both Goodreads and Thomas Dunne Books. The House of Dreams moves between two time periods, the 1940's Nazi occupied France and the year 2000 in Long Island. The 1940's France story is centered on The American Relief Center run by Varian Fry, also known in present day as \"America's Schindler.\" It is their mission to help well known artists and intellectuals escape to the United States. The center is set up in a beautiful old house called \"Villa Air Bel.\" Several recognizable names in the art world stay at this house such as Peggy Guggenheim and Andre Breton. The year 2000, centers around Gabriel Lambert, who escaped France, married, and built a life on Long Island. For over 60 years, Gabriel has kept many secrets about his past hidden, but a determined journalist is trying to uncover what exactly he has been hiding. The premise of this story is a good one, but my main problem with this book is the way the author moved between time periods. It became very choppy and extremely long winded at times. Two of the female characters in the book, Mary Jayne and Miriam, had such ridiculous conversations, I found myself wondering if I could finish it. One minute they are discussing how terrible it was to see men who were imprisoned behind barbed wire fences with emaciated faces. Then in the next paragraph discussing \"how great the new house will be, just like in college or a swank hotel, it will be just like Christmas with music and dancing.\" Ugh, I almost couldn't stomach them.  Gabriel's story becomes interesting in the end which made me glad I stuck with this book. Also, enjoyable at the end is the author's notes that addressed what happened to Varian Fry and several of the artists that stayed there. I rated this 3 stars, but at times even dropping to 2.5 stars during the story."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1494253-angie", "userReview": "3.5 starsThe historical side to this story is set in 1941 Marseilles, France and details some of the courageous rescue efforts by Varian Fry and the ARC of artists, intellectuals, etc. His \"set\" is included as a good cast of the characters here. They were colorful, and I had fun googling some of the real photos described of them in here. I had never heard of Varian or of the good things he accomplished. I enjoyed the mystery side of the story of artist Gabriel Lambert and his past and also the enduring love story of he and Annie.The modern side here is in the year 2000, America. Sophie is a journalist sniffing out the Gabriel Lambert backstory. She has a sort familial tie to his past and wants to know what really happened, not only for her story but also for her family. Will she succeed in getting to see Gabriel or in getting any answers out of him? When is it ok to just let the past stay in the past, as much as curiosity strikes you? Should some secrets be let to lie hidden forever?Interesting story! It's a bit slow to reveal itself, but can be savored that way. Make sure you pay attention to who is narrating each section and don't get too hung up on the sideline stories. Recommend to historical fiction readers!**Many thanks to NetGalley and St Martin's Press for an ARC e-galley!**PS--absolutely stunning cover, one of my favorite cover arts for this year!"}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "I won't go into a lot of detail here now because I read this book in order to write a review which will be online at some later date, I think, if that's how it works, anyway. But just for brief posterity, I wasn't sure what to expect with this book. I think the cover is lovely (but it's a stock photo and I've seen it used in a different cover recently, so that makes me a bit sad), and I was drawn to the story because it involves artists in 1940 and the rescue workers who helped them. There are real names throughout this story (Chagall! I love you!) which made the past story line feel real, in the way many reflections on what 1940 was like feels \"real\", which is whatever glamorized version of that period was.The present time in the story was also interesting because therein lies a bit of a mystery, and I'm always into books that involve some family mystery/research/finding out of the truth, and I was not necessarily disappointed, but the twist at the end was a bit... meh... I'm not entirely sure how I felt about the twist. It was surprising, yes, but I'm not sure it was the direction I would have gone.

Choppy scenes and short chapters; innumerable point of view shifts for no discernible reason.

This seems to be following a popular trend of late about little known heroes of WWII. This book one centres around Varian Fry and the American Relief Fund and its efforts to get intellectuals and artists out he Vichy France, while saving hundreds of 'ordinary' as well. Fry and many of the characters were real and did incredible work but the story is fiction. The history was fascinating, it's billed as a real-life Casablanca. The story is a bit slow in the reveal but had a few twists I appreciated. The past-present writing style will appeal to Kate Morton fans, though I find it is starting to be overused.

Kate Lord Brown tells the fascinating, little known story of Varian Fry and his team at the American Relief Center (ARC) in Marseille, France during World War 2. This remarkable group heroically managed to assist countless artists, writers and other intellectuals escape Nazi Germany during the war. Brown creates a fictional reclusive artist, Gabriel Lambert, who in 2000 is nearing the end of his life and Sophie Cass who is a writer for the New York Times who wants to interview Lambert for a story on which she is working. The novel is told from the perspective of various characters and alternates between the early 1940\u2019s and the year 2000. As the novel unfolds, Lambert\u2019s story is revealed.The title refers to the house rented by the ARC right outside of Marseille called Villa Air Bel. Famous artists and writers gathered there while waiting to escape Europe to head to the United States. The Sunday meetings there were legendary, and people would come from all over to participate in the Sunday sessions. One of my favorite parts of the book was reading about these meetings.I loved so many things about this book. The author writes beautifully, and the characters are very well developed. As the novel progressed, there were several twists that I totally did not see coming. Many novels today are so predictable, and I love it when an author is able to surprise me with a good plot twist. The author\u2019s note at the end is very insightful and provides a lot of detail about the real people she describes in her novel. Providing such wonderful details about the actual lives of individuals included in a historical fiction novel adds so much more to the story, and I was so glad she took the time to provide all of that information. In addition to all of her research, Kate Lord Brown actually consulted with two of the characters that are in the book which I am sure help make the story that much more authentic.I highly, highly recommend this book. There are many books written about this time period, and this is certainly one of the best I have read.

I thought it would be a sweet 1940-ish love story but nope. I was pleasantly surprised. The story is about Varian Fry and all he did for the effort of setting people out of a France during WW2. You get to meet a band of his colleagues and clients as well. Not all of them but a few. The trials they must go through in order to obtain visas, passports, identification papers. Whether Jew or not. It is amazing to me how quickly a day can change in this line of work and how he never gave up and took it upon himself to save everyone he could. Whether getting them out the country, prison or gestapos. The end goal of concentration camps and death looming in the background for him. The book mainly focuses on the time spent in Marseilles at a Air-Bel chateau. They had clients and colleagues stay there to get out the city when it wasn\u2019t safe. The other story is about Gabriel Lambert. A journalist but also a link to his past, Sophie Cass, wants to hear his side of the story those 50 plus years ago. But Gabriel is harboring secrets that he doesn\u2019t want anyone to find out. Only two people know his secrets; one is his wife (Anne Bouchard) and the other one is dead. Now Sophie wants to talk and it stirs up memories in him that have been dormant so long since he left France. He even looks at Sophie and is transported back in time to Vita (Sophie\u2019s Great Aunt). At first this book was slow. Like really slow that I fell asleep a couple times. But after I got through the introductory parts I wanted to know more about Gabe and the secret he had. I was guessing till the end. It did seem the story would speed up than slow down too often but it\u2019s only 300 pages so I powered through. I was intrigued to find out in the end where the author notes are that there really was an American named Varian Fry and he is written down and commentated at the Holocaust Museum. I feel horrible that I don\u2019t know anything about this man. Even though he was given the same honor as Oskar Schindler.
