Probably because they were people like us before we try to give us a bite and let us die in anguish (Has anyone else noticed how waste food? And so many people starving). Well in this collection of essays is decrypted which is the reason why we sidfo invaded by the zombie culture, as it started and how, something happened, we would change. Besides this seeks to explain the success of TWD.Not all the works are jewels but some of them are so deep in their arguments and talk to you in a so entretaiment way that you can spend hours read it and enjoy it. So if you like zombies, not necessary that be TWD, this book can like you very much because isn't fatalist, is about the humans in a risk situation not about that situation.A digital copy of this book was provided by NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Wayne McCoy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4054541-wayne-mccoy", "userReview": "'Triumph of the Walking Dead' Edited by James Lowder is a series of essays that came out of few years ago. It's still a bit relevant because although it was printed after the first season of the show, events that were taking place in the comic have been in more recent episodes.The essays are great and a lot of fun to read. Arnold T. Blumberg talks about the history of zombies in comics, and how they were once banned, but crept their way back in. Kay Steiger talks about race and gender politics in the show and how they persist even in a world gone crazy. Ned Vizzini has an essay called 'Rick and Rand: The Objectivist Hero in The Walking Dead' that speaks on Rick and his changing philosophy and how it relates to Ayn Rand. Even though the CDC and Edwin Jenner was never featured in the comics, this gets mentioned quite a few times. My favorite episode is by David Hopkins and it makes a case that Carl might be the true protagonist of the series and his role as the 1.5-Generation Immigrant in this strange new land.In all cases the essays are intelligent well written. Most of the essayists are familiar with the comics series and all are familiar with the TV version. For fans of the show and comic, there is a lot of thought provoking material here.I received a review copy of this ebook from BenBella Books and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you for allowing me to review this ebook."}, {"userName": "Alexis Winning", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6192649-alexis-winning", "userReview": "Just awesome! This is an anthology of essays on the subject of The Walking Dead, mostly an exploration of the comics, but also of the show. In this book we see why the franchise has been so successful with ideas of archetypes, psychology, and the exploration of human nature examined through the backdrop of the zombie apocalypse. I recommend this book to anyone interested not only in The Walking Dead, but the zombie horror genre. It is an intellectual read, and I can picture this being of \"required reading\" for any university course on the subject of zombies in popular culture and the media. There's a few Goodreads author submissions as well (Jonathan Maberry and Kim Paffenroth), who offer intriguing insight into the mythos of The Walking Dead. So please read and be enlightened as to why we simply can't get enough Walking Dead!"}, {"userName": "Michael Ngo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18575240-michael-ngo", "userReview": "I enjoyed hearing the different perspectives and essays in this collection. Most of which one doesn't really think about when watching The Walking Dead."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/638550-daniel", "userReview": "This review originally published in Looking For a Good Book. Rated 3.5 of 5\"The Walking Dead\" is a surprising television hit. It is water-cooler discussion fodder, and, like so many pop culture hits of this era (it seems), it is based on a comic book series by Robert Kirkman. And what happens to 'hits'? People analyze them and write about them. This book is a collection of essays about \"The Walking Dead\" - both the comic series and the television series.I've never read the comics/graphic novels, and I've only watched through the first three seasons of the television series, but the essays here often had me thinking about the series (and the concept) in a much deeper way. Which, when you stop to think about it, is kind of crazy since we're talking about a tv show featuring zombies.But as these essays point out, there's an awful lot of metaphor and symbolism going on within these stories.I enjoy non-fiction, and I really enjoy essays on specific topics, and in line with this, I enjoyed these commentaries on this very pop-culture theme. And while some of these did have me thinking twice about the series, and even had me wanting to finish watching the entire run, and all the essays are very intelligently written, nothing caught me so deeply that I feel the desire to share it with everyone I know.My favorite essay is probably the first one, \"The Pathos of The Walking Dead\" by Kyle William Bishop, which examines the genre and its history.I also very much like Jonathan Maberry's \"Take Me to Your Leader\" which looks at the genre of apocalyptic literature and where The Walking Dead fits into that genre, and the role of 'leader' through such an apocalypse. \"Despite the fact that the Walking Dead comic book is one of the bleakest, most downbeat and nihilistic stories ever told, even in a genre known for those qualities, Kirkman manages to sew a thread of hope through the tale\" writes Maberry.Fans of the series (whether comic or television) who also enjoy more than just the action/adventure of the hour-long tale should really enjoy this. Those who study pop culture will find this indispensable.The book features the following:Foreward - \"The Walking Dead, with Entourage\" - Joe R. LansdaleIntroduction - \"In Media Apocalypsis\" - James Lowder\"The Pathos of The Walking Dead\" - Kyle William Bishop\"Take Me to Your Leader\" - Jonathan Maberry\"Four-Color Zombies\" - Arnold T. Blumberg\"A Novelist and a Zombie Walk Into a Bar\" - Jay Bonansinga\"Meaninglessness\" - Craig Fischer\"Zombie People\" - Brendan Riley\"No Clean Slate\" - Kay Steiger\"Happy (En)Trails\" - Vince A. Liaguno\"Rick and Rand\" - Ned Vizzini\"Postmodern Merlin\" - Kenneth Hite\"Feel Better?\" - Steven Schlozman\"The Walking Dead and Dance of Death\" - Lisa Morton\"A Zombie Among Men\" - Scott Kenemore\"The Hero Wears the Hat\" - David Hopkins\"For Love is Strong as Death\" - Kim PaffenrothAcknowledgmentsWhat does it say about our culture when stories about the dead rising up and wreaking havoc, bringing about an apocalypse, are some of the most popular stories of the day? A book such as this helps us answer that very question.Looking for a good book?  Triumph of The Walking Dead: Robert Kirkman's Zombie Epic on Page and Screen, edited by James Lowder, is a collection of essays looking at an unusual hit television (and comic book ) series which fans of the series will absolutely want to devour.I received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2850786-jennifer", "userReview": "Why read: Received for reviewWhat impressed me: Many aspects of the comic books and TV show were discussed, both in relation to one another and as separate entities. I loved that there was a large focus on the comic storylines as they greatly differ from the show and have been around for much longer. I was afraid this book would just be a complete lovefest for the show because of its current popularity. It was a lovefest, but it really did only slightly touch on the show (as it should being there had only been one season at the time of writing) and embraced Robert Kirkman's initial vision.What disappointed me: Everyone sort of agreed. Most of the Smart Pop books include essays with opinions and theories that are completely at odds with others. They usually contain ideas that will completely rile up hardcore fans, while at least making you think about things in a whole other light. In Triumph of the Walking Dead, beloved characters remain loved and praised, evil characters are pure evil without questioning their potential for good, and all in all, nothing came across as a potentially unpopular opinion.Recommended: Definitely, as long as you've read the comic books and watched the show already. Those who haven't read the comic books will discover many spoilers, some of which will most definitely become part of the TV show."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7392930-brad", "userReview": "Having never watched the show and only read the first graphic novel in the Walking Dead series, I picked this up solely because it contained a piece by Ned Vizzini. His piece \"Rick and Rand: The Objectivist Hero in The Walking Dead\" explores how Rick uses Ayn Rand's \"virtue of selfishness\" to preserve himself, his family and the people he leads, as well as the ways he falls short of the Objectivist ideal. It is cultural criticism with a few wry observations for the Vizzini completist.\"In the twenty-first century, we live lives burdened by crushing, metastasizing obligations: to our bodies, our clothes, our homes, our cars, our jobs, our kids, our internet presence. The apocalypse offers us a chance to erase all of these and scale life back to one responsibility--staying alive.../...We want the world to end, in short, because we do not want to pay the cable bill.\" (128-129)\"Altruism stands in opposition to the rational self-interest that Rand believed was man's best motivator.

Like any anthology I didn't put the book down loving every entry in the book, but I can at least say they all they were worth a read.Although this might be something that turns other readers off, I really liked that the essays for the most part are written during a very obvious time. When this was written the T.V. show had only ended one season and the comics up to a certain point and most of authors make mention that their analysis only goes up to those points. Parts of the book come off as a time capsule one The Walking Dead's cultural impact. It was incredibly interesting what people expected from both the comic and the T.V. show going forward, especially being able to know where both have gone over the last couple of years.I highly recommend this read to anyone who is a fan of either the TV show or comic and wants to hear analysis deeper than \"I Love that!\"."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7097002-donna", "userReview": "Love the walking dead have got all the comic book series and watched all the boxsets.
