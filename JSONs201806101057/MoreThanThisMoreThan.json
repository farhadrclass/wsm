Loved every single page! I\u2019m going to throw this out at the very beginning of my review- this one is going straight to the favorites shelf! In one night my fairytale ended... or it may have begun. \u2028It\u2019s just one day. 24 hours. But for Mikayla, that one day alters her entire life. Kayla\u2019s life was pretty great. She had fun and awesome parents, a sweet little sister, a best friend- Megan, and her boyfriend of 4 years, James. In one night, she loses them all in some way. In that night, she also finds the other half of her heart. Kayla meets Jake, the circumstances are less than ideal, but in some way or another, they just connect. She would never know this random guy she meets on the night of her prom will change her life, save her life. Jake doesn\u2019t know what it is about Mikayla, but from the moment he lays eyes on her, he knows. Something is different about this girl. He can\u2019t let her walk away. After a traumatic event, Kayla finds herself leaning on Jake, relying on Jake, this boy she has known less than 24 hours makes her feel safe, cared for, he lessens the pain.\nTheir bond, their friendship, it\u2019s just amazing. JAKE is just amazing. I\u2019m talking Josh Bennett, Andrew Parrish type amazing. The best kind. I\u2019m a little obsessed with this guy. As time goes on, Jake and his family and friends are exactly what Kayla needs to heal and try to get on with her life. She and Jake have some serious feelings for each other, even if they don\u2019t admit them out loud. Jake gives Kayla the strength she needs to go on. \nI think I\u2019m in love with this beautifully broken girl.\n\n\nI so much more than a lot like you.\nI loved the friendship these two developed. The intimate moments they shared. The build up and sexual tension was off the charts. \nWaiting for these two to reveal how they truly felt for one another was brutal at times... even though they weren\u2019t official, I loved that they still belonged to each other. \nAll Jake ever wanted was to be there for Kayla, to take care of her, love her. But he wants all of her, not just parts, so he waits until she is ready to give him all of it. \nIt\u2019s the fucking hardest thing to do, to be around the person you love, with everything you have, and not be able to love them.\nKayla knows how she feels about Jake. She has never doubted those feelings. Others can see it too...\nThe way she looks at you- like you\u2019re the only one. You\u2019re it, Jake. You\u2019re all of it. Her forever.\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just you. It\u2019s only ever been just you. It will always only ever be just you.\u2019\nIt\u2019s just getting to the point in her life when Kayla feels complete enough to be with Jake wholly that is difficult. But sometimes, you have to move on. Let go. Embrace your life. \nI will not let bad people dictate what should be a good life.\nSome of my FAVORITE things/quotes:\n\n\n\u2018Why does he get to call you Kayla, and everyone else calls you Mickey?\u2019 I shrug. \u2018Because my family called me Kayla.\u2019Do not settle for anything less that the Jake Andrews of the world. Because they exist, and not just in fairytales.Once he\u2019s inside me, I work it out, why I never felt like this before. Because if I compare my feelings for Jake to anyone else, then I know. I know I\u2019ve never loved anyone before. Not even a little bit. Not even at all.I love him, so much more than a lot. \n\nThis book was just all kinds of awesome. It will put you through the ringer emotionally. The best part was, even through all the tears and devastating, emotional moments, there were a lot of smiles, a lot of swooning, and a lot of laughter. Isn\u2019t that the best kind of book? That can make you feel, make you cry, but also makes you happy. It is for me. I loved the dual pov- inside of Jakes head... YES! I know I touched on this a little bit before, but Jake Andrews... Jake was everything you could ever want in a man. Seriously the best. Without him, I don\u2019t even know how Kayla\u2019s story would have turned out. He is just incredible! There were also some pretty wonderful secondary characters: Lucy and Logan were my favorite. I swear Lucy could be my twin- lol ;) And Logan... I am so happy he is getting his own book. But the ending sentence or two... what was that? I need more of this guy! Heartbreaking, heartwarming, beautiful and emotional story about love, friendship, moving on and letting go. Don\u2019t pass this one up. I can\u2019t even tell you why I loved it so much- it just gave me that \u2018feeling\u2019, you know, the one you get after you read a book you can\u2019t get out of your head- I just was so happy after reading, you couldn\u2019t get that smile off of my face! Highly recommend this one!!! \u2665"}, {"userName": "Alexis *Reality Bites*", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5587514-alexis-reality-bites", "userReview": "SPOILER FREE REVIEW -mature content reader discretion is advised.5 STARS out of 5Genre:New Adult Romance2013 FAVORITEThat moment when you find a book you love..and can barely contain your excitement because you want to share it with EVERY ONEIt can\u2019t be just me\u2026 You have to read this book I cannot be alone in this love fest. I need my fellow book lovers to read this book! ASAP!\nMy Casting\nREVIEWBecause I need to know.I need to know how she feels and what she wants from me, from this. If she wants to be MORE THAN THIS. ~JakeProm night should be one of the best nights of your teen life right? Well, that is not the case for Mikayla. For her prom night becomes the night her life forever changed; in more ways than one.\n\u2018I look over at the cute brunette and wait for a reaction. I feel like I should leave, like what I\u2019m witnessing is too intimate, too personal. But my feet are locked to the floor. I have no idea why, but I can\u2019t look away. I can\u2019t walk away.\u2019\n ~JakeJake and Mikayla meet under horribly embarrassing circumstances, nevertheless they bond and by the end of the night whether they realize it or not they are tied to each other for life.I spent the beginning of this book an emotional wreck. At 3% I was steaming mad. At 14% I was happy and laughing my ass off. At 17% I get hit right in the back of my head with a sledge hammer. It hurt\u2026It hurt so damn bad.As Mikayla tries to reassemble the pieces of her life that are left she becomes close to Jake and his family. A guy who barely knows her but now holds her fragile heart in his hands. Moving on is not easy yet she slowly does and Jake is right by her side. Mikayla quickly learns that Jake is, The Jake Andrews, an all star baseball pitcher and predicted to go pro.A very close friendship blooms between them; at times it is so intimate that I felt like I was intruding on all the moments they would share. Jake is careful not to push her in to something she is not ready for. But he wants her. B A D. Not just sex either. He wants her. All of her.And she wants him too. All of him.The intensely burning chemistry with these two makes for some very steamy angst filled moments!\n\u2018Nothing like a mind blowing orgasm to keep a goofy smile on my face. Oh. My. God. Jake. Fucking. Andrews.\u2019\n ~Mikayla\n\u2018We\u2019re looking so intently into each others eyes, trying to see into each others souls. Talking without speaking. Feeling without touching.\u2019\n ~Mikayla \n\u2018I\u2019m two seconds away from exploding and I warn her but she won\u2019t. fucking. stop.\u2019 \n ~Jake\n\u2018He kisses away the tears that have fallen all over my wet face. Then he looks at me, really looks at me. And then his lips are on mine, and my eyes close because the sensation is so overpowering.\u2019\n ~ Mikayla\nFave scenes\n(without any major details)-After prom the bon fire...-Every scene with Logan...-The letters...-The Prince in a Flashback of a young Mikayla being told a story by her mom...My ThoughtsThe story is told in dual pov so we get inside both Jake and Mikayla\u2019s head which I must say is a true pleasure. READ THIS BOOK! You know you\u2019ve struck gold when a book can make youHappy, sad, laugh out loud, swoon, then cry all in the first 20% of reading.The characters Jake is a total alpha. You best not look and you sure as hell better not touch his girl because he won\u2019t hesitate to whoop that ass. He is also loving, tender, sweet, understanding and patient with Mikayla. It is as if he was exactly what she needed and vice versa. And yeah, he\u2019s kind of a big deal! Mikayla this girl goes through so much yet she is still standing talk about recovering from a lost. After losing so much you can barely breathe. She is just..WOW. Smart, funny and no idea how beautiful she is, inside and out!I gave these two a pass for not being able to communicate all of their feelings. Which can be frustrating for readers. They are both 18, so I feel as though characters under age 22 get passes because they most likely have not had the chance to be in more than 1 long term relationship yet. Even with my pass they fared well. Insecurity was the biggest issue with these two.The secondary characters will not only catch your attention, they will leave you wanting more. Mainly Logan, the guy is freaking hilarious. I think for me the best part of the secondary character roles are played by the parents. The parents carry a strong presence in this book. Major thumbs up for that Jay McLean!Dear Megan,The ending, no cliffhanger\u2026 BUT even though we get a sweet epilogue, readers will still get a nice little twist at the end. This twist will leave your jaw on the ground. Trust me. Because even though you could have predicted it\u2026 So much goes down in the book that you forget about it until its right in front of your face on the page. It is literally the last sentence of the book...My RatingsCharacters- lovable, witty and charmingWriting Style- Fair, there was excessive usage of slang and a few editing issuesPlot/Storyline- Strong it will grab you from the first pageSteam Factor- High/VERY HOTOverall- I LOVED IT! READ IT!!!Now go forth and read.

A Prince so handsome, he will make your heart skip.\u201d\nUtter devastation and loss.....Only to be brought back to life by your very own white knight.More Than This by Jay McLean is one of those books that will leave you experiencing a plethora of emotions. I went from being utterly devastated and gutted, to laughing, to swooning, to shock and finally having a whole and happy heart. It was definitely not an easy journey but the most beautiful ones never are. Jake Andrews:\n\u201cNothing says awkward like coming in your pants while dry humping.\u201d*He's not the hearts and flowers kind of guy, but he's the heart and soul kind, and fuck if every girl would not rather that than flowers.*I saw more than a few guys checking her out. I couldn't help putting my arm around her, and bringing her into me. Because it's the stone age and I'm a caveman.\nMikayla Jones:\n\u201cI am a fucking awesome girlfriend, some asshole is going to be so lucky one day.\u201dI swear to god, I hope that asshole will be me.\nMikayla meets Jake on her prom night. She has just discovered some devastating news and Jake just happens to be there to pick up the pieces and help her out. Mikayla\u2019s prom night becomes the one night that changes her life forever. Two overwhelming and earth-shattering tragedies rock Mikayla\u2019s world in one night. With no one else to turn to, she clings to this perfect stranger who is determined to be there for her when her world is falling apart at the seams.As Mikayla attempts to pick up all the shattered pieces of her life, Jake and his family step in and take care of her. A strong and formidable friendship begins to bloom between Jake and Mikayla as Mikayla starts to become stronger and begins to move on with her life. Jake is by her side every step of the way. Jake and Mikayla\u2019s unbreakable bond leads to love. It is a slow build up to getting to the point where Mikayla is truly committing herself to Jake. She believes that she needs to stand on her own two feet before diving into a relationship with Jake. After all, she has been so dependent on Jake and his family and she needs to know that she can make it on her own. Completely understandable; however, this did cause many moments of frustration on my part.\nI think I do, love her, I mean. I think I\u2019m in love with this beautifully broken girl.*\u201cHey, Jake?\u201d\u201cYeah, Kayla?\u201d He\u2019s almost asleep.\u201cI more than a lot like you.\u201dIt\u2019s quiet for so long I don\u2019t know if he heard me. Then, \u201cI more than a lot like you too, so much more than a lot.\u201d*\u201cGod Jake, I so much more than a lot like you.\u201d\u201cMikayla, I passed that stage a long, long time ago.\u201d\nJake meets Mikayla by chance but once she is in his life he is unwavering in his determination to never let her go. He falls head over heels for this beautiful girl with a broken heart and spirit. I loved the fact that Jake never pushes Mikayla for more than she is ready to give. He is simply there for her and trusts in the fact that they are meant to be and that Mikayla would one day be ready to take things further. Jake becomes Mikayla\u2019s pillar of strength and as Jake fights hard to hold on to \u201chis Kayla\u201d, Mikayla struggles with being so completely dependent and taken with Jake. Mikayla must come full circle and discover for herself that Jake completes her and she definitely does not have to become this complete person on her own to be with him. Theirs is a forever kind of love that had already survived loss, heart-ache and so much more. They were the other half to one another.More Than This is an achingly beautiful tale of loss, friendship, healing, love and ultimately moving on. It was heart-warming and emotional and a must read for readers who enjoy the new adult genre. My only criticism is the amount of slang used in this book. Yes, I realize that the characters were in high school and then moved on to college but I felt like the author tried too hard at times which lead to the overuse of some terms like \u201clegit\u201d (ex. \n\u201cThat Casey bitch is legit no joke.\u201d\n). With that being said, I truly loved this book and am looking forward to Logan\u2019s story in the next book. Out of all the secondary characters we meet in this book, Logan had my heart right from his first drunken appearance. All in all, this is a great book.

This book was recommended to me by two different friends but I hadn\u2019t really read many reviews so it took me by completely by surprise. I WAS NOT prepared for all the feels, and let me tell you, there are plenty. And the hotness factor, oh my gosh, was off the charts. \nMikayla is eighteen years old, just two weeks away from graduation, and it\u2019s prom night. She is going with her boyfriend of four years, James, and her best friend, Megan. Mikayla has a wonderful family, her parents and little sister. She and James have their college all picked out and everything is perfect. This night is going to be perfect\u2026or so she thought. The night that started out with so much promise ended up being the night that forever changed her life, her future. It was a night of betrayal and horror. That is also the night she met Jake.\n\u201cHow can everything, EVERYTHING, be taken from me instantly?\u201d\n\nJake is also eighteen years old. He is a star pitcher and as his parents would say, kind of a big deal. His college scholarship is in place, his future set. He just happened to be at the same restaurant as Mikayla that night, Jake with his own friends, when he witnessed the beginning of the downfall of Mikayla\u2019s night. So like her very own prince charming, he rescued her. He introduced her to his friends who accepted her immediately as one of the group. Little did they know what the rest of the evening had in store for them.\nAfter the horrors of that night, Jake\u2019s family takes her in and Jake is by her side every step of the way. He is her strength, her rock. She can\u2019t stand to be away from him for even a minute. As the days and weeks progress, their bond strengthens. \n\u201cShe\u2019s just, more, than anyone else. We haven\u2019t slept together, we haven\u2019t even kissed, and she\u2019s just\u2026more.\u201d\n\nThis book is full of the healing power of love. Jake\u2019s family and friends take Kayla in as one of their own, never hesitating. Jake is patient, never asking more of her than she is willing to share. \n\u201cHey, Jake\u201d\u201cYeah, Kayla?\u201d He\u2019s almost asleep.\u201cI more than a lot like you.\u201d It\u2019s quiet for so long I don\u2019t know if he heard me.Then, \u201cI more than a lot like you too, so much more than a lot.\u201d\nJake knows he is in love with Kayla but he can\u2019t tell her, not yet. He\u2019s afraid she\u2019s not ready to hear it, or what if she doesn\u2019t feel the same way. Kayla knows she is in love with Jake as well. But she\u2019s broken. How can she give herself to him when she\u2019s broken? \n\u201cI\u2019m scared. So scared. That I won\u2019t be enough. And that I\u2019ll never really have him. My Jake.\u201d\n\nThese two were only eighteen years old but forced to deal with things that no adult should ever be faced with. But this book was really a story of the healing power of love. Jake, his family and his friends all giving Mikayla the love and strength she needs to get through the most difficult of times. This book is full of so many fantastic quotes. The chemistry between these two freaking electric. And wow, the ending. That was a shocker. Well, two shockers actually. The author knows just how to make us want to come back and read the next book. It worked because now I\u2019m hooked and will have to continue on with book two, More Than Her, and get Logan\u2019s story.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just you. It\u2019s only ever been just you. It will always only ever be just you.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Pearl Angeli", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31514572-pearl-angeli", "userReview": "(SPOILERS ahead...)\nIt took every ounce of control I had not to DNF this book. It's one of the most unrealistic stories I've ever come across with!Here are the reasons why I didn't like it:UNREALISTIC PLOT - This is a work of fiction, I know. But why make the whole thing unbelievable to the extreme? Mikayla found out one day that her boyfriend cheated on her with her best friend. That same day, she also met the gorgeous guy with a sexy Aussie accent named Jake and well, instantly felt attracted to him. THAT VERY SAME DAY, she experienced great loss when her family members were murdered. The next day, she became part of Jake's family and Jake's family offered her shelter even if she's a complete stranger. Okay, I don't mean to sound so selfish and insensitive here because the girl lost everything she had, but honestly, all shit happened in one day? MIKAYLA - Mikayla is also one of those unbelievable heroines ever existed. She just lost everything but I couldn't believe her way of coping. It didn't take her a week to move on. She can even laugh with Jake's friends and she even had time to entertain such unnecessary thoughts.. like how Jake is so damn sexy and how his accent always gets her and so forth and so on. INSTA-LOVE  - YES. Insta-love big time!!!SIDE CHARACTERS - Why everyone that is close to Jake treats Mikayla like the way they treat an old-time friend confuses me. How did these people instantly warm up to her? They've just met her and then, just like that? So unbelievable!TOO MUCH JEALOUSY AND INSECURITIES ALL OVER THE PLACE - Nuff said. I cannot bring myself to recommend this book to others because it's completely over-the-top . Much as I tried, I just couldn't like this book. I was groaning inwardly and rolling my eyes at every scene. Ugh. Overall, this book wasn't for me. I didn't feel connected to everything.

Instead, I found that the middle strayed considerably from the intensity and intrigue of its promising beginning. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy what this story offered, because I did. But I felt some major issues were never fully explored while certain trivial issues were intensified. Luckily, the ending delivered some more of that awesomeness I was longing for!More Than This kicks off to a highly intense start: We are introduced to Mikayla, who is having a pretty crappy prom night, only to learn than things will shortly go from bad to worse. Or, more accurately, from bad to utterly devastating...And. I. Was. Floored. But, even in the midst of a world shattering tragedy, Makayla was granted a silver lining, and his name was Jake Andrews.Jake quickly became Kayla's rock, and an undefined but intense relationship was formed. This is where the plot started to lose me a bit...The ever popular jealousy and mistrust issues were a nice source of tension, at first, but then the book began to flood with it; until it was page after page of 'why are you talking to that guy; why is that girl staring at you?' little conundrums. In moderation, this would have worked wonders. But it became far too consuming and began to downplay the original depth of the plot.That said, there were really terrific elements that persuaded me to hang on to this story. The strong family/friendship dynamic was heartwarming and I loved that each character displayed their own personal redemption. There were many laugh-out-loud moments, and the characters were well-developed and extremely hard NOT to love! Jake and Kayla had an amazing, solid connection, even if they were hesitant to define it. Jake was like an undercover alpha. He was sweet, caring, warm...and then BAM! Jake unleashes his possessive, dominant side that was both highly sexy and slightly bewildering. I thought maybe he'd have a sort of back story explaining his insecurities and extreme mood shifts, but I guess he just had a fun little caveman side. However, he was a true sweetheart and an amazingly sexy hero!Although this story did sometimes yoyo my emotions, overall, it was a great read with beautiful messages of pain, healing, friendship, and love. Its concept was refreshing and unique, and I'm looking forward to Logan's story! \n\nBook Stats:\n\u25aa\t Genre/Category: Romance/New Adult\u25aa\t Steam Caliber: High.

It's been under my nose for so long, so many of my friends have read, devoured and adored this series and here I am only just starting this epic 'more than' marathon. I can only say that I'm an idiot, but at least right now I'm a happy idiot and blissfully enjoying the start of my Jay McLean type book binge. From prologue to epilogue this book had me wrapped round it's little finger and I'm happy for all you Jay McLean enthusiasts to sit back and give me a big smug 'told you so'. There wasn't much not to love about this author and her writing style, I for one feel hooked and I'm hoping to love the rest of the series just as much, (if not more).What did I love?Jay McLean books are definitely shaping up to be paperback worthy treasures. Just look at those covers, they totally appeal to my cover lust addiction and what's truly making me break out in the book addict happy dance is the fact that what's inside the front cover is gorgeously lovely too (day made). 'More than this' is a book that has that unforgettable quality about it, the author has certainly written a story with some 'wow' moments and it definitely had some plot twists that I honestly did not see coming. The book spoke to me of friendships, love, healing, heart ache, pain and belonging. It was a journey that I loved and even though I'm super late to the party I'm glad I finally decided to take the plunge and start this series. And what a beginning it was, I don't know whether to love the slow burn nature of this story telling more or Jake Andrews the sweetest new adult hero to ever be created. Almost read in one sitting I was helpless to this authors writing charms, if I was to say I had one regret it was not starting this series sooner, I feel like I have missed out on all the love and excitement surrounding this series but I'm more than willing to make up for time now and I'm gagging to get started on Logan's story in book two of the series 'More than her'. Why not five?For those of you who are interested (and even if you're not, just humour me) when I rate a book I don't rate in halves, so if a book falls somewhere in between a star rating I always round down. So what I'm trying to explain (rather badly) is that this book fell somewhere between a four and a five but something held me back from giving out the full out five. And why? Well I don't want to start being nick picky about a book that quite frankly will be unforgettable but I did have a few niggles that made me want to hold off from a five star. Simply put I needed some more insight into the journey of the characters, I wanted to get into their heads a little more and understand some of the decision making and feelings. I also found myself wondering about certain plot lines and questioning just odd bits and bobs. One of the things I loved about this book was confusingly one of the things that slightly annoyed me and that my fellow readers was the whip lash, and the non communication about how we really feel about each other drama and The see-saw playground love adventure that had me going round and round in circles with this couple. However, with those gripes aside this book has owned me and I don't want to dwell on the pitfalls so much as what I did love and I'm sure that overall this is going to be a five star series for my book tastes. Final thoughts ...If like me, you find yourself being a book idiot too, and you haven't yet started this series then quite frankly I have nothing else to say to you than this; you must, must, must start this series right about now (I demand it). And if you are a fellow addict that has already loved this series, then I'm proud to say I'm giddy exited to have finally joined team McLean. (See what I did there)? I read a lot of books in the romance genre and I love everything about this book community and the special ability that these authors have to give me an escape from reality, but what made this book stand out to me was it's heart grabbing originality and honest sentiment. I really could not be any happier than I am right now, as well as this book taking me out of a reading rut, I've also managed to discover a new author to love and a series that I can't wait to read the rest of (this is officially a happy book day). That's it from me and with nothing more to say, fingers crossed to loving book two in the series ..."}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13095060-beverly", "userReview": "This is a read now on NetGalley - if you haven't fallen in love with this series, now is your chance!!5 More than love this series StarsThis series was recommended to me a while back by two of my favorite friends, and every week I kept moving it on my calendar.

I have joked I am the last person on GR to read this series and that is probably true, but if you like me have not read this series yet JUST DO IT!!When the story starts we meet Mikayla. She is the smart girl, dating the popular jock and best friends with the head cheerleader. She doesn\u2019t really feel like that make sense, but it has been her life for the last four years. On prom night her senior year her entire world comes crashing down around her. The one positive outcome from that night is she meet Jake Andrews. Jake Andrews is kind of a big deal, he is a star baseball player, already being scouted my major league scouts. Kayla and Jake meet and from the that moment they have this connection.

Or it may have begun...\"\nMore Than This\u00a0 was a very sweet and sometimes heartbreaking book about love, loss, healing and friendship. It was laced with some sadness following a horrific tragedy but the feeling of the book was more focused on healing, rebuilding and finding happiness again.I loved the hero and the core group of characters and will be looking forward to the next in the series. This one however reads a complete standalone with a happy ending :)So, about the book...Mikayla's life fell apart the night her boyfriend of four years cheated on her. On the same night, she met Jake. Having witnessed the whole debacle and seen how deeply she was hurting,\u00a0Jake felt innately protective of her and invited her to come join him and his friends. Something about him just felt 'right' and she trusted him enough to accept. His friends welcomed and acceptd her and for a few hours, she was able to feel happy again.Everything was beginning to pick up until they returned home and her entire world was shattered by a senseless tragedy that wiped away everything she loved in life in one horrific moment.But she wasn't alone. Jake took her in and this boy who she'd known for less than a day became her pillar of support and source of comfort.\n\n\"I fell asleep in Jake's arms, sheltered from all the bad and evil in the world.\"\n\nIt was so heartwarming to see how supportive and kind Jake's family was to her. Not to mention the fact that there was definitely more between Mikayla and Jake. You could feel it, and they knew it but given the tragedy, their feelings were put on on hold while she healed. There were no labels,\u00a0nothing official, but their hearts bonded. Jake was there for her every step of the way and their romance developed very slowly and naturally.\n\"She's just, more than anyone else. We haven't slept together, we haven't even kissed, and she's just ... more.\"\nHere they were, at 18 years old, facing a horrible tragedy and yet also falling in love. They really held back on acting on on their feelings for a while and I understood that. Jake was giving her time to grieve and Mikayla needed to to just heal and also\u00a0felt like she had to stand on her own before she could fully allow herself to fall in love. I understood where she was coming from but this aspect did lead to some frustration later on in the story.I really have to say that Jake was just amazing. I loved him! Between his slight accent and deep voice (which I so wish I could hear)\u00a0mixed in with both his naturally protective vibe and his sweet gentlemanly side too, he was just some kind of perfect. He loved her, was patient, kind, thoughtful, understanding... everything about him made him very easy to swoon over :)\n\"I saw more than a few guys checking her out. I couldn't help putting my arm around her, and bringing her into me. Because it's the stone age and I'm a caveman.\"\nI liked Mikayla. She was a bookworm too and I mean, she knew who Josh Bennett was, okay? *grins* I did really like her but I had a little harder time fully connecting with her as the book progressed because of they way she kept Jake at bay for so long. I will say though, that her feelings and reasons\u00a0were all fully explained in the end so I could definitely see her side of the story. And apart from that one thing, I really liked her as a character and loved her and Jake together.\n\n\"Do not settle for anything less than the Jake Andrews of the world. Because they exist, and not just in fairytales.\"\n\nThe supporting characters in this book are wonderful! I loved them! Jake's friends were just awesome! Their group dynamic was so much fun to read about and I felt instantly connected to them. I loved how easily they accepted Mikayla into their group as well with no questions. And some of the couples were just adorable. Check out this quote about one of the guys, it makes me want to read a whole book about him:\n\n\"He's not the hearts and flowers kind of guy, but he's the heart and soul kind, and fuck if every girl would rather that than the flowers.\"\n\nAnd this book officially has the coolest book parents of all time. I really loved seeing parents depicted this way in a book because, not to say that it's the norm, but many books have rather troubled parental relations and seeing a family that was a genuine unit who loved each other, and were understanding and supportive was a welcome change.We're told the story in alternating POV's and so we do get the complete picture here. It was a very easy book to read and the pages flew by quickly. I found the story jumped around a little bit more than I'd like but there were no slow points and that the story line was constantly moving forward.For some reason, I really expected this book to be heavy and intense and, don't get me wrong, there were certainly places of sadness but it also had a lot of lighter, funny moments that shone though.While I loved that in the beginning nothing was rushed, I did feel like they (well, Mikayla) held back for a little longer than I'd have wanted. I just felt bad for Jake - he was just crazily, head over heels falling for this girl who kept holding a huge part of herself back.\n\n\n\"It's the fucking hardest thing to do, to be around the person you love, with everything you have, and not be able to love them.\"\n\n\nThat being said, there was never any doubt in my mind or their hearts that they were meant to be.\n\n\"It\u2019s just you. It\u2019s only ever been just you. It will always only ever be just you.\"\n\nOne little tiny thing that bothered me was that I felt like despite the fact that they were in high school, some of the slang was a little over used - like 'legit'. But it's a small complaint.The story was addictive in the sense of I really could have easily read it in one sitting had my time allowed for it.\u00a0It kind of rode the line between YA and NA. There were some very steamy scenes but no actual descriptive sex.I wanted a little 'more' some places and a little 'less' in others but I still really enjoyed the story, really loved Jake and Mikayla as a couple and am glad I read it.The next book will be about Jake's best friend and so while I'm sure we may see these characters in it, this book fully reads as a standalone with a happy ending (complete with an epilogue too!) so if you like the sound of this one, you're safe to start it whenever you wish :)\n\n\n\"I so much more than a lot like you.\"\n\n\n4 stars.For now, here's my casting for Jake: *Mikayla*In one night my fairytale ended. Or it may have begun. This is my story of friendship and love, heartbreak and desire, and the strength to show weakness.*Jake*One night I met a girl. A sad and broken girl, but one more beautiful than any other.

A loving family, a hot boyfriend and a best friend, it seems nothing could happen to ruin the life she's living. Until the night of her prom when everything falls apart, everything she's always held dear ripped from her life. Everything she has always believed in is proved to have been a lie.The one thing that anchors her and prevents her from drifting away is Jake. A chance meeting but he becomes her saving grace, the one who pulls her out of the darkness threatening to swallow her whole. Before meeting Kayla, Jake had only one goal in mind. Starting his career in sports. Nothing has ever distracted has ever meant more than this, until Mikayla comes into his life. He wants her badly and is prepared to wait as long as she needs, he's protective of her, doesn't want to see her hurt.Their relationship is tentative at first, but as time goes by the begin to have deeper feelings for each other. Mikayla's traumatic experience is all that stands in their way. It's up to Jake to show her that he can help her, that pushing him away is the worst thing she could do. He has to prove how much he loves her flaws and all, that by being together she can heal.\nFinal Thoughts\nI genuinely enjoyed this book. I loved Jake, he was the perfect blend of sweetness and alpha male. He never gave up on Mikayla. I liked Mikayla too, although her logic was a bit exasperating at times, but it was understandable, seeing as she had gone through something traumatic. The dialogue between the characters and writing was very realistic making this book very engaging so I was never bored. The angst wasn't over done so I didn't feel overwhelmed which makes it a great read in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Jay McLean", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21630404-jay-mclean", "userReview": "[moving rooms scene (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11971939-jamie", "userReview": "THIS BOOK WAS TOTAL FANFUCKINGTASTIC!!!\n\nIT WAS JUST........\nThis was a book I could not put down... it consumed me.

Yeah, i know it was heartbroken in the most part, but i like ever single moment inside that book!!!First of all, it was a book about kindness, strength and courage... About family and real friendship... And finally it was about love... The kind of love that never ends!!! The kind of love that from the first moment stand by you and become more that everything!!!Yeah, it was a messy situation but it was as \u03b1 result of a disastrous beginning!!!Did i confuse you??? Let me make the things clear for you...Mikayla is living a nice life... She is having the most lovely parents and a little young sister that she loves very much!!! They are a very happy family!!! She is dating James for four years now and she is having an amazing best friend, Megan... Oh, yeah! I know! She is so lucky!!! Until an asshole spills his drink on her dress in the prom night!!!! Yeah, i know... Who cares about this shit???? Please be patient!!!Well, because of that fact, she discovers that her boyfriend and her best friend are having sex behind her back for two whole years!!! Assholes!!! And that moment steps in Jake who unwillingly become a witness of this ugly situation... Jake for the first time that he lays his eyes on Kayla,he instantly fell something drown him toward her... So, he offers her a way out of her prom and invited her to his own.... So, Kayla meets him and his friends, who all welcoming her as if was their own from the first moment... Even though she 's hurting from the betrayal, she allows to herself to have a good time with these new people!!! Until the moment she returned home and her life changes forever... A big tragedy hits her door and leaves her alone and desperate... The only one who stays beside her from the first moment is Jake. A boy that she known for a few hours.... Nobody else is there for her... So, between them forms a strange and deep bond that they lead them in new and unknown paths!!!I felt so pity for Kayla... What happened to her family was so fuckin' unfair!!! What she had to get through was heavy and unbarable...But i liked the fact that even though everybody that she loved and counted on them for almost all her life left her alone when she needed them the most, she finally found out unexpectantly kindness from people that never knew before... I liked that all Jake's family and his friends embraced her from the beginning and stay beside her without a question or a doubt!!!I liked Jake very much!!! He was an amazing guy!!! He was handsome, kind and he fought so hard to be next to Kayla all the time... His presence healed her in a way!!! He gave her the strength to carry on with her life! He fell in love with her for the first moment and he never gave up on her, even though when she pushed him away!!! Their connection was strong and intense... First of all, they couldn't stay away from each other and they were in deeply need to be touching physical all the time... Phew!!! There was so much sexual tension around them which almost never found a realise because they avoided to get it straight!!! And that's one thing that i didn't like... They become so deeply in love but they delayed so much to declair their feeling and that fact frustrated me so much!!! They were saying that they belong to each other but they didn't have put a lebel to their \"friendship\"...I really don't know what else can i say about this book!!!I had a great time reading it with its ups and downs... I cry, i laugh, i felt sorrow, joy, desperation!!!! A little bit of all kind of emotions...I just want to say that i hated Megan... She was the worst BFF ever!!!!What the fuck was in your head???? Phew!!! Now i can't wait for Logan's turn because at the end he confused me and i wish that i didn't read what i thought that i read...

All answers are from the book and not made up! I promise there are NO SPOILERS! Okay here we go! Me: Hi Ms. Jones! Thanks for agreeing to meet with me! (Technically, I had to drag her here\u2026prying her away from Jake was nearly impossible)Mikayla: Micky...call me Micky...please. Me: Okay Micky! *clears throat* I know you\u2019ve heard this many times in the book, but I am so, so sorry for that night. I just\u2026just can\u2019t imagine what you must have felt. What you still feel.Mikayla: *her eyes are brimming with unshed tears* It was one night. One night when everything changed. It was so much more than just the betrayal. It was the tragedy. The deaths. The murders. But it was also that feeling. That feeling of falling. Me: *opens and closes mouth\u2026I mean, what can you say to that?* Wow, what an eloquent way of describing a tragic night. Micky, I\u2026wait, feeling of falling? Falling deeper into a pit? Or falling in love with\u2026.Mikayla: *blank stare, no answer*Me: Okaaaay then, I take that as \u201cread the book to find out.\u201d *mutters* Micky, what was you reaction when you first saw Jake, um, after that incident?Mikayla: I can\u2019t believe accent boy just witnessed that whole thing. I\u2019m so fricken embarrassed by all of it. Mainly because I was the dumb girl that just got played for so long. Me: Yes\u2026Believe me if I was there, my first move would be to bash a certain someone\u2019s nuts. He completely deserved it. Moving along, how is Jake\u2019s family? They certainly played a huge role in your life and in the book. Just curious to know how you\u2019re taking it all in\u2026Mikayla: It hurts less today then it did yesterday. Because being here, being with them, it\u2019s familiar in a good way\u2026Jake, he makes things hurt a little less. He\u2026he\u2019s home for me right now. He\u2019s my Jake. And I\u2019m his Kayla. Me: *sniffle* Oh yes, I understand. *romantic sigh* (Is it just me, or did the air get really heavy in here??) Oh Micky!!! I have to ask this question!! I absolutely ADORE Lucy! She\u2019s literally my favorite character, well, after you hehe. What\u2019s your most memorable impression of her? Care to share?Mikayla: \u201cI swear to god, Micky. I\u2019ll cut a bitch for you, just let me go, Cam. Let me go!\u201d *snickers*Me: *laughs* Oh, I so remember that scene! That chick cracks me up! And she reads! What an awesome buddy! I\u2019d love a Lucy in my life, especially a drunk one! Okay, as we are winding down, I have the most serious question to ask you, and I'm not the only one who wants an answer. Are you ready?***Pause***If you could describe Jake in one sentence, what would you say? *leans forward to hear answer*Mikayla: I feel sorry for all the girls in the world that never get to experience a Jake Andrews at least once in their lifetime.Me: HOLY. SHIT. Me too...*plotting a character kidnapping* If only I had one of those\u2026*wink* Well, thank you so much Micky! I\u2019m so glad I got a chance to speak with you!Mikayla: Okay then, thank you!Me: AAAAAAND CUT! *turns to you* Thanks for being part of the audience! I hope you enjoyed listening to Micky as much as I did! \nThoughts the second time I read it\nI read this first in August and can I say WOW! I\u2019ve highlighted pages and pages of epic quotes and all I did was just look at them and \u2013boom \u2013 I\u2019d remember exactly what the scene was or what the characters were doing. Like the first time I read it, this book grabbed me by the collar and dragged me in until I finished! Could. Not. Put. Down. So don\u2019t even try to read it unless you\u2019re prepared to finish it in one sitting! Jay McLean, you are my hero! Cannot wait for Logan\u2019s story!"}, {"userName": "Duchess Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2204947-duchess-nicole", "userReview": "\"Talking without speaking. Feeling without touching.\"\nI shouldn't like this book, but I really did. I've had all these issues with this genre lately, but I keep getting sucked into reading them. And sure, yeah...this story contained some of my pet peeves. It's pretty darn angsty. The setup is a bit off the charts, and so is the melodrama. But I was glued to these pages. I don't want to even say what happens within the first few chapters because I think it would spoil the story. I went into it with only a vague idea of what to expect, and I'm glad. \nWHAT WORKED:\nI loved JAKE!!!! I know, I know...everyone loves Jake. But seriously, this guy is amazing! He's got that super protective, gentle air. He's attracted to Kayla (Mackayla, Mickey) instantly. When he witnesses the ultimate betrayal, his protective instincts kick in, and he's there to comfort her. He's her shoulder to cry on, her big strong man to rely on.\n\"I think I'm in love with this beautifully broken girl.\"\n Perfect word to describe Jake: Steadfast!!So not only is he the biggest freaking sweetheart ever, he's also a major hottie. Here's our boy...and oh, look! There are his group of cohorts in the background...I'm seeing the guy in back as Logan...I love how Jake says...in such a self deprecating manner...\"I'm kind of a big deal.\" What a cutie!!!There was a lot of funny in this book, which I didn't expect with all of the sad subject matter. Let's face it: Kayla goes through some really horrific times within the six or so months that this book takes place. But there a moments of much needed humor to lighten the feel.\n\"His eyes bug out of his head. \"Okay, smartass,\" he yells, but it comes out 'smuuhtuhhs.' Australians don't use R's apparently...\"\nOh, yeah...that Australian accent...freaking YUM!!!I also adore it when the author makes it apparent that she also is an avid reader, that she also has book boyfriends, and that she might actually obsess over them just like we do. I mean, what better way to make your readers identify with your characters than do mimic their insanity? Perfection. Shout out to Josh Bennett from The Sea of TranquilityI loved all of the secondary characters...Jake's group of friends really were so wonderful. They instantly accepted Mickey(Kayla) into the fold, and added more of that humor to the mix, but also gave Mickey the loyalty that she didn't get from those that should have been loyal at the beginning. Here's a tidbit from Lucy, the most awesome of drunks:\n\"...that fucking bitch has it all, ten out of ten every fucking thing. She's super smart. Like, fucking Harvard smart. She's nice to fucking everybody. She's always looked like the cover of a fucking magazine and I hate it so much and if I could get away with it I'd fucking cut a bitch for you.\"\n\nWHAT DIDN'T WORK:\nThe whole back and forth between Jake and Kayla, the jealousy, the things so typical to this genre that drive me freaking batty. I mean, seriously...the dude has practically carried you through the last few months of your life...it's okay if he talks to a girl. The whole no-kissing situation started off as cute, but it eventually bugged that ever loving crap out of me. It's just too unbelievable, and with all of the other sexual things they did, not kissing seemed like an odd plot device. Also, this entire book is one HUGE TURN ON................Every...Freaking...Page...Is...Foreplay.So that \"sex\" scene? Left me hanging, big time. In fact, I'm not sure...did they even actually have sex? Hmmm...very disappointing. If your going to make the book THAT sexual in nature...and let's face it...this book is extremely sexual....PLEASE, for the love of God...give us some real sex. It doesn't have to be explicit but come on...Wrapping it up...I really loved this book, sort of despite myself...these characters are all normal people...no one really acts over the top or out of character for the way they were intended. Yes, it's a bit too dramatic, but I've just resigned myself to a bit of soap opera with this genre. I remember being a teenager, and a young adult. This is pretty much the way I felt about everything...emotions running amuck and all that.I see that there is another book in the works about Logan, which I'm sure we're all stoked about, especially after showing his sweetheart side to Mickey a couple of times and spouting his drunken longing for love. He hasn't found a girl that makes him feel? I bet Jay McLean can!!"}, {"userName": "DW", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40762852-dw", "userReview": "I had no idea what I was getting into when I picked this book out.

Stars!More Than this is the first book I have read by Jay McLean, it is what I affectionately class as a \u2018kitchen sinker\u2019, in that it feels like the author has literally thrown as many tropes as she possibly can at it. This is the type of book I need to be in a certain mood for, otherwise I just get frustrated and annoyed. Luckily, I was in the right mood, although I did get a little frustrated, but that was more to do with the copious amounts of almost home-runs, and dry (as well as wet) non-humping that went on for most of this book.I\u2019ve been a part of the worst night of her life.Mikayla has to be one of the unluckiest characters I have had the opportunity of reading about in quite a while. It is difficult to write a detailed review because of her story as it would pretty much give most of the book away. Betrayal and Tragedy are words that are used in the synopsis, and they do pretty much sum up the biggest parts of the story.Jake and his friends are what made this book for me, I liked Kayla for the most part, and even though the bulk of the story is a result of the things that happen to her, he was the one I actually cared about as the book progressed. The guy (as well as his family and friends) literally puts his life on-hold to help her through the worst times imaginable, and at points I really struggled to understand her actions and reactions towards him. What dropped this book from the full 5 stars for me was the fact that with all the drama already going on the author then felt the need to add in random acts of both of them trying to make the other jealous as well as failing to communicate with each other about totally banal things bringing about totally pointless arguments as well. I also found the whole \u2018Casey interludes\u2019 to be a complete waste of time (unless she figures in other books in the series more prominently, if so I will take that point back!).\u201dIt\u2019s just you. It\u2019s only ever been just you. It will always only ever be just you.\u201dI am late to the party with this series, but I kind of like that, because I now have 3 books I can read in succession and a new release due at some point in 2015. Win-Win! This may have been the first book I have read by this author; it damn sure won\u2019t be the last.ARC generously provided via Netgalley, in exchange for the above honest review."}, {"userName": ".Lili.

This is the beautiful coming of age story of Kayla and Jake. They meet on a night in which Kayla loses everything she loves and Jake was there to help keep her together. The author did such a wonderful job depicting their pain, sorrow, joy, and intense chemistry. Their commitment to each other was felt on every sentence, every page. All the characters were well developed and the author took great care with building their relationship. We were on their journey with them. We were with Kayla as she went through the different stages of grief and we were with Jake as he was her rock. He was so patient and understanding with her. I loved their chemistry.Every look, every touch was felt. I seriously felt butterflies as I was reading it.She's looking at me with so much emotion that I hope to hell that I'm reading her right, that the look she's giving me is telling me everything I want to hear.
