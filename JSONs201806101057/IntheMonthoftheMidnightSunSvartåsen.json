It's a time to flush things out, to eliminate, to seek liberation. It's a month of light. The month of the midnight sun.''\nCecilia Ekb\u00e4ck's Wolf Winter is one of the greatest literary loves of my life. A novel that transported me in a distant, mystical setting, in a way that few novels have managed to do. Therefore, there was much anticipation and excitement when I opened the front cover of In the Month of the Midnight Sun. As I was reading on and on, I realised that Cecilia Ekb\u00e4ck is a witch of words. She weaves and casts spells with her sentences and the images she creates.The title alone is enough to attract our interest. The midnight sun is a uniquely beautiful experience. The resurrection of nature after the endless darkness. But is light a source of joy and hope? In this story, the light of the sun is not enough to reveil the secrets of a troubled community and a family that is falling apart.The story starts in Stockholm, where we meet Magnus, a mineralogist, who is sent by his father -in -law to a mission involving the brutal murder of three people. Lovisa, Magnus'sister-in-law, is sent away with him. So, the story moves on to Lapland, the land of mystery and the midnight sun, and particularly to Black\u00e5sen, a place we first met in Wolf Winter. Magnus will find more secrets in his attempt to seek the answers, secrets that go beyond everything he has ever taken for granted. Biija, an older woman and one of the residents of the area, becomes his guide, while she is struggling with her own questions and terrors of the past.There are three points of view in this novel. Magnus, Lovisa and Biija who names herself Esther. Each character represents a microcosm, a smaller part of that big, dark-mouthed monster called society, but they aren't stereotypes- how could they? It's Cecilia Ekb\u00e4ck, after all. They are fully fleshed-out and fascinating. Magnus is a scientist, a man who believes in what he sees and has the clarity of mind to realise the secrets that are kept sealed, and still, the patriarchal values with which he was raised, manage to influence his own views. It is through his contact with Lovisa and Biija that he succeeds in reavulating his prejudices. This brings us to Lovisa who- for me, at least- is our eyes to the story and the very heart of it.While Magnus and Biija are restricted by their religious and social expectations, Lovisa has the freedom of the person in despair, the one who is denied by everyone and has the open mind to accept and infiltrate whatever she considers useful. Lovisa is one of us, we witness a significant part of the story through her eyes. Biija has the wisdom of her people, the ability to ''see'' and ''read'' the nature and its signals without the smoked mirrors of society. In the character of Biija, we witness the fight between the Old Religion, the Pagan Ways of the region, and the attempt of the priests to smother everything they cannot understand, everything they fear and name it as ''evil''. Their relationship with the teachings of Jesus is non-existent. As usual.\n''At the Resurrection, Jesus will return to wake the Faithful. What will he do if He finds them incomplete?''\nPatriarchy and Religion are the two main themes in the story. Ekb\u00e4ck has them working in parallel ways, driving the plot forward. Lovisa, a victim of patriarchal oppression in its most vicious form, finds a new affinity to nature and a new understanding of the people around her through Biija who represents the Old Ways. There is a comparison between the women's position in the Pagan past and the rules and orders of the ordained priests against them. No need to say which one is the losing side...Aside from these themes, Cecilia Ekb\u00e4ck stresses the importance of Nature, how the people of the past retained a special kind of wisdom due to their sacred proximity to their environment, their respect for every living thing, for the trees, the mountains, the soil...This is done in a language of impeccable beauty, with short sentences that make the narration move faster. Short,meaningful paragraphs is a characteristic feature of Nordic Literature, giving this special ''something'' to the novels.If you have read Wolf Winter, you will equally enjoy In the Month of the Midnight Sun. Ekb\u00e4ck takes a mystery and turns it into a novel that is part-Noir, part-Historical Fiction, part-Magical Realism. The story takes place in 1856, in Lapland, but the questions it poses are- and will always be- crucial and relevant to any time and any place. You need to read this one and experience the beauty that is Nordic Literature at its finest..."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn", "userReview": "Stockholm, 1856 and geologist Magnus Stille has been summoned by his father in law, the state minister for justice. He asks Magnus to travel to Black\u00e5sen Mountain in order to carry out a mineralogical survey, but in actuality to investigate the murder of three settlers by a native Lapp. The Lapp was found sitting with the bodies of the priest, the constable and a visitor and the government needs to know if this is the start of a Lapp uprising or if the men were murdered for another reason. Along with these tasks, Magnus is asked to take his sister in law, 20 year old Lovisa with him. She is in such disgrace for an unnamed crime that her father has cut off all her hair.This story takes place some 136 years after Wolf Winter, but the people and the setting feel familiar, although now we see them in summer in June, the month of the midnight sun, not in the depths of winter. Black\u00e5sen still looms large and threatening over much the village, which is slowly dying and strangely has no children to continue on. The Lapps still migrate to their summer lands but have become Christian and no longer worship their old spirits. However, the spirits haven't left and still speak to them. The narrative is told from multiple points of that, that of Magnus, Lavisa, and Ester/Biiji, a Lapp woman who has stayed behind whether tribe went to their summer camp to mourn her husband, Nila, the outcast leader of their tribe. Magnus gradually unravels the mystery surrounding the villagers and the Lapps with the help of Lovisa. Although not particularly likeable at the start of the book as a spoilt girl from a privileged background, Lovisa is open minded and accepted by all. Despite the constant summer light, the atmosphere is eerie and tense. There are many secrets going back many years, not least that being kept by the mountain, which Magnus will need to uncover before he can leave."}, {"userName": "Sonja Arlow", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow", "userReview": "3 \u00bd starsSet 100 years after the events of Wolf Winter the story opens with the murder of 3 town settlers, the priest, the constable and one other person.

Her debut novel, Wolf Winter was one of my favourite reads of 2015, so when I had the opportunity to read her new release (set 150 years later in the same setting) I was very excited! She\u2019s a brilliant writer and creates a character-driven and intricate plotted murder mystery that keeps you guessing until the very end.It\u2019s 1855 in the Swedish Lapland\u2019s Mountains and three men have been massacred. An indigenous man is in custody but refuses to talk. The Minister of Justice in Stockholm sends his son-in law Magnus, a geologist along with his exiled daughter Lovisa (and Magnus\u2019s sister in law) to investigate and check on the Mountain resources. Once again, the Mountain is the star of the novel, it takes on a character in itself and creates an eerie backdrop to the intrigue of the murder mystery. Unlike Wolf Winter, this book is set during summer; known as the month of the midnight sun and so the heat creates an atmosphere amongst the people where frustrations simmer just below the surface.Magnus is an interesting character whose past begins to emerge as he finds himself feeling at home in the mountains, while Lovisa redefines her identity without the disapproving observations of her father. Their meeting with settler and older Lapp woman Ester, initially fraught with distrust draws them together to uncover the mystery of the murder and the horrific tragedies that have been buried in the Laplands.I won\u2019t go too much into the plot; it\u2019s really one of those stories you just have to read and experience for yourself. And in many ways when describing the plot it doesn\u2019t seem like much really happens, but Ekback manages to make a lot happen without having to say much. I like that she allows the reader to read between the lines and discover things rather than being spoon-fed the clues.Fans of Burial Rites will enjoy this one. Another great thriller and this author is definitely one I will seek out again in the future."}, {"userName": "Magdalena aka A Bookaholic Swede", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379514-magdalena-aka-a-bookaholic-swede", "userReview": "Dual review with Swedish first and then English!\nSWEDISH REVIEW\nMidnattssolens timme inneh\u00e5ller alla de element som jag verkligen gillar i en bok.

I am extremely fond of reading historical suspense novels and Sami culture has for years fascinated me. I have not read Cecilia Ekb\u00e4cks earlier novel The Wolf Winter. However, it is high on the list of books I want to read.Magnus Stille is son-in-law to the Minister of Justice in Sweden. Magnus is sent up to Svart\u00e5sen (The Black Ridge) in Lapland to survey the area. However, he is really there to investigate the circumstances of the murder of the three men who were brutally murdered by a Sami. On the trip is also Magnus sister-in-law Lovisa who have been forced by her father to travel with Magnus because her behavior does not fit how a woman should behave at the time. At least that's what her father thinks. When they arrive at Svart\u00e5sen do they notice that something is not right, there is a darkness over the small village that they are staying at in Svart\u00e5sen...I found the book extremely fascinating to read, in addition to the compelling story does the book also give an insight into the Swedes' treatment of the Sami people, how they were christened and how the land was taken away from them. Ekb\u00e4ck skillfully tells the reader in this book how the Sami have been treated. How they are classified as different kinds of race and that the appearance and the way they live are dumber. Unfortunately, this kind of racism is not unheard of today. The book is extremely interesting, and I love when stories have a supernatural vibe so I found this book especially interesting because the line between reality and the supernatural is often crossed.In the Month of the Midnight Sun is an amazing book, one of the best historical suspense novels I have read. Besides the mysterious case of the dead men, do I think Ekb\u00e4cks description of women's lives in the 1800s in Sweden was fascinating to read about. Magnus sister-in-law Lovisa cannot like her mother and sister adapt to the life that is expected, and because of that will it either be the cloister or madhouse for her. It is up to Magnus what her fate will be. For it is a man's world they live in...Thanks to Wahlstr\u00f6ms och Widstrand f\u00f6rlag for the review copy!"}, {"userName": "josbookblog", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52112315-josbookblog", "userReview": "In the settlement on Black\u00e5sen Mountain, one of the natives has slaughtered three of the settlers. The reason behind this act is unknown, and he hasn\u2019t spoken since being found at the scene, neither protesting his innocence nor offering any explanation.In Stockholm, the Minister asks his adopted son, Magnus, a geologist, to investigate the crime and to interview the perpetrator, as well as to survey Black\u00e5sen Mountain, rich in iron deposits. As he leaves, he is given a third task \u2013 to take his sister-in-law and the Minister\u2019s youngest daughter, Lovisa, with him on the journey north as punishment for an unspecified transgression. The two journey north, yet when they arrive, they find the settlers reluctant to talk, their behaviour strangely threatening.Set in 1856, In the Month of the Midnight Sun is told from three alternating viewpoints: Magnus, Lovisa and Biija \u2013 one of the natives to the region, who has left her tribe and come to Black\u00e5sen, their traditional winter camp, following the death of her husband. They form a somewhat unexpected alliance, as they seek to solve the mystery around the murders, whilst also mapping the iron rich mountain.Of the three main characters in the novel, it is the two women, Lovisa and Biija that I liked the most. Magnus I found to be a little frustrating, and very much of his time, in that he seems to rather futilely hope that Lovisa will somehow miraculously start to behave as (society believes) a young woman should. He continuously underestimates her, even when she proves to be more observant of the village and its inhabitants than he is.\"you don\u2019t respect women\u2026 You look down on us.\"Lovisa isn\u2019t immediately likeable, however, and is presented as a confused young woman, outcast by her father for an (initially) unnamed transgression. She comes across as both troubled and troublesome, and it\u2019s apparent that she is perceived as being difficult by her family.\"I misbehave, face repercussions, but something or someone saves me, time after time.\"Proud, privileged, attention seeking and something of a petty larcenist (despite her well to do background) she initially comes across as being quite unlikeable, yet Lovisa has her own strengths, and I found myself warming to her as the novel progressed. Under previously inexperienced hardships, her pride manifests itself as a determination to succeed, and I admired her perseverance.Biija is quite different to Lovisa. Part of the Sami tribe, her nomadic nature means that she has little concern for material possessions. She is quiet and observant, and understands more of what is going on than Magnus and Lovisa. Through Biija, the reader is able to explore the theme of two separate cultures integrating, and the inevitable fallout this brings, as Christianity has little time for older, alternative belief systems. I loved her descriptive names for those around her, such as Bear (Magnus), which I found to be both humorous and accurate.In the Month of the Midnight Sun is clearly well researched, yet Ecb\u00e4ck doesn\u2019t use this to overwhelm the reader with details. She has successfully struck the balance between using her knowledge to subtly enhance the story without resorting to information dumps. I loved her taut prose which successfully evokes the wilderness around Black\u00e5sen Mountain. I loved the observation that man seeks to dominate nature, and the personification of nature as a person being mistreated:\"People are not supposed to look at mountains the way Bear does. He strips it, embarrasses it.\"Whilst ostensibly about a murder mystery, In the Month of the Midnight Sun has much more going on, and is a complex novel that encompasses many themes. Somewhat reminiscent of Burial Rites, In the Month of the Midnight Sun is an involved and thought-provoking novel which I thoroughly enjoyed.Review originally posted on:https://josbookblog.co.uk/"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31686613-jennifer", "userReview": "This is a fantastic book. I love the way Ekback weaves supernatural themes throughout her books. But she never allows her characters to use this to deny their own agency - the bad things that happen throughout the story are done by humans and not monsters, and they spring from very human foibles, not some otherworldly force. In Wolf Winter, the winter season that the characters lived through was almost like a character in its own right, along with Blackasen. However I felt as if Blackasen took over sole carriage of this role, its presence as an entity in its own right throughout the story was palpable. It wasn't so much summer that played with the characters in the way the season did in Wolf Winter, but rather the light. In some ways it was like a luminating force revealing things to the characters. In other ways its glare made it difficult for the characters to see things that were right in front of them. The build up to the finale was great. I loved Louise as a character but I came to feel a real sense of compassion for Magnus. Their growing mutual understanding of the other was beautiful to read.Ekback's introduction of the fourth voice to the story on page 101 was so simple and yet it really packed a punch, just those three words, \"There you are.\"In some ways it is a much more subtle story than Wolf Winter, but it had no less of an impact. I can't wait to see what else Ekback has in store for Blackasen and its inhabitants."}, {"userName": "Cphe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14907696-cphe", "userReview": "A strongly delivered historical mystery set in Sweden in the latter half of the 1800's.

There's no sense of urgency for anything.It's a glaring contrast to Wolf Winter where there was that creep, cold and uncertain feeling around everything happening. The characters talked to each other, secondary characters had their own traits and problems. Each had their own mysteries, fears and problems to solve, not to mention the danger lurking around.Now here there's nothing of the sort. I wonder if it's because of the choice of going multiple POVs in first person. I don't know if was the characters or the style that made everything sound so internal, distant and individualistic. They're left too much to their own devices and internal monologue.Maybe if Magnus had his family with him (or if they were already settled in Blackasen) and Lovisa was around or sent there, things could've turned out to be different in that regard. There are themes of culture destruction, societal roles and rules, but those were also in Wolf Winter, but with more stakes, tension and characterization for us to care about. I very rarely DNF a book, but I just couldn't bring myself to proceed. I read half of it, then put it down. Returned a few days later, read 10% more and decided I couldn't do it anymore.

Magnus is a scarred orphan of unknown origin, raised by the minister to a life of service to the state. At the last moment he sends Lovisa, his own errant daughter too, a young woman who fails to meet her father\u2019s expectations of behaviour. What happens to her in the far north is of no concern to him.This is a beautifully told tale, set in the forested wilderness of Lapland among a sparse and shrinking population in the disorientating month of the midnight sun. Magnus cannot sleep in the near constant daylight; he is in turn exhilarated and sickened by his surroundings, but, like Oedipus, is driven to investigate more than is ultimately healthy for him. Lovisa, whose conflicted personality manifests in mild kleptomania, begins to live in a new freedom for the first time.The story is told from three (or four) vantage points: the loyal but curious Magnus, the volatile, sensitive Lovisa and the elderly Lapp woman, Ester, who is mourning the recent death of her husband. The subtle portrayal of character is one of the highlights of the novel, as well as the vulnerability of humanity evident in their thoughts, emotions and reactions.Of course, there are dark secrets both in the settler community and the Lapp tribal group, as well as in the background of Magnus himself and these lead to a bloody denouement. There is a mystical, even magical, element to the plot also, not discordant with the mysterious setting, but perhaps a bit much at times for the rationalism of this reader.

It wasn't a book I necessarily enjoyed but it stayed with me long after I was finished reading. So when I saw In the Month of the Midnight Sun I knew I had to read it.In many ways this is the one I prefer of the two. In the Month of the Midnight Sun keeps the overawing presence of the mountain but moves the timeline forwards around 130 years. So we have the same setting but all new characters and all new societal rules. Before reading Wolf Winter and In the Month of the Midnight Sun I knew next to nothing about the history of the Lapps or Sweden and so both books proved educational for me. However there is no info-dumping and I felt absorbed into the world very easily.The writing of In the Month of the Midnight Sun was easy to read and I read it much faster than I had anticipated. The book is divided into three sections and each section had its own distinct feeling. The first section felt more historical in nature whereas from the second section onwards there was a mystical element that, surprisingly, worked really well into the plot. The final section was, perhaps, the most tense. After the big reveal at the end of the second part I wasn't sure where the book could possibly go. What could be more horrifying than that? But there was a tension to the ending of the book that kept ramping up right to the kind-of-cliff-hanger of the last page. I am not usually a fan of cliff-hangers but here it definitely worked and I know I will be thinking about that ending for a long time.As well as three sections there are also three different narrators. They all have very distinct voices and of the three I would say Magnus was my favourite. He comes across as the most rigidly factual and the most sensible and so there is a reassurance to his voice in amidst all the tension and drama happening around him. He strikes me as definitely the sort of person you want with you in a crisis. Lovisa, meanwhile, took a while to grow on me. At the beginning she can be very selfish and wilful and I definitely agreed with many of the things Magnus said to her. But as a character she also had the most growth as the book progressed and is the character I would most like to see more of. Finally we have Biija, an elderly Lapp woman who has secrets of her own that unravel as the book progresses. She, like Magnus, had a fairly comforting voice but, due to her secrets, her chapters also contained a lot of menace.The plot was excellent, it starts with a dramatic event - the murder of three men by a Lapp and then the remainder of the book is Magnus, with the help of Lovisa and Biija, attempting to unravel why this happened. It isn't just a detective novel however. With the natural menacing presence of the mountain and the secretive nature of the inhabitants there is a definite thriller aspect to the novel that I really enjoyed. I was along for the ride and almost every reveal took me by surprise. I was kept guessing right up to the last page, and even beyond, and now I am desperate for more.Overall I think this book shows amazing growth in Cecilia Ekback's writing and I am very excited to see what she writes next. The characters, setting and plot all combined to produce a book I won't be able to forget and an ending I will be thinking about for a while."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1860691-lisa", "userReview": "In the Month of the Midnight Sun is a historical crime novel set in a fictional Swedish village in 1856. Three men are found slaughtered, their murderer - a Lapp, one of the nomadic Sami people - sitting quietly with them. He does not speak to explain, nor does he resist when he arrested and imprisoned. Magnus Stille is sent with his wayward sister-in-law, Lovisa, to investigate under the guise of mapping the mountain, Black\u00e5sen, the village lies in the shadow. Biija, a Lapp who has left her tribe after the death of her husband, stays close to the village and watches. Black\u00e5sen itself may have a role to play in the mysteries and horrors that beset this small town.I found Cecilia Ekb\u00e4ck\u2019s In the Month of the Midnight Sun to be quite an comfortable read. The prose is easy to digest, the characters are interesting and the mystery is intriguing. However, as I read I also found clear faults with the novel.The writing, for me, never quite hit the spot. Written in first-person, present tense, and narrated by Magnus, Lovisa and Biija, the voices all sounded a bit too similar. It was only that each chapter was marked by the initial of the narrating character and the actual content of the chapter that told me who was narrating. I also would have restructured the first section of the novel. As it is, the story is in alternating sections \u2013 Biija then Magnus then Lovisa then back to Biija and so on. But as the first section has Biija\u2019s chapters taking place in the spring before Magnus and Lovisa\u2019s, I would have grouped together and placed them first and then introduced Magnus and Lovisa.Ekb\u00e4ck has created some fascinating characters, but I didn\u2019t feel there was enough of them on the page to really get a good idea of them. There\u2019s a lot of things that interest me about Biija, Magnus and Lovisa, but they\u2019re sort of referenced and then left unexplored and undeveloped. The central mystery is intriguing \u2013 did the Lapp really kill those three men, why did they die, what secrets lie in the mountain - but I didn\u2019t feel like these mysteries were solved. Where we began to see the solution unfolding, I was on the edge of my seat for the reveal \uf02d and then just left cold and a little confused by the follow up. There are a lot of interesting things to find In the Month of the Midnight Sun, but overall I was left nonplussed by it."}, {"userName": "Jo Bennie", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4318349-jo-bennie", "userReview": "The year is 1856. Magnus Stille is the adopted son and son in law of Karl Rosenblad, Chief Minister of Justice in Stockholm. Magnus is a geologist at a time when there are tensions between Swedes migrating north into Lappland and the indigenous Lapps. Far to the north of Stockholm in the tiny village of Blackasen three men lie dead, killed by an elderly Lapp who will not speak and tell what happened. Karl sends Magnus north on the pretext of mapping the mountain above Blackasen. Officially he is there to investigate the possibility of mining iron ore from the mountain. Unofficially he is there to find out what happened in the village and whether it is the beginning of a Lapp uprising. Karl also sends with Magnus Karl's unruly grown up daughter Louvisa who has done something unnamed, something so terrible her father will not have her under his roof any more.Magnus and Louvisa travel north by steamer, cart and finally a 2 hour exhausting walk and come upon a village in which there are clearly secrets but it is not clear who is hiding what.Magnus and Louvisa are two of our narrators, their chapters headed with a capital letter M or L to indicate who is speaking. The third named narrator is Biija named Ester by the Swedes. She has just lost her husband Nila and has travelled back to her tribe's wintering camp above Blackasen village. There is a fourth unnamed narrator, more ephemeral but ultimately identifiable.An interesting byzantine story where landscape and narrative, past and present are in dialogue with each other. The different narratives give us different perspectives. To Magnus the mountain is a resource. To Biija it is a living often dangerous presence. The summer white nights keep Magnus awake and affect his mood, Louvisa sleeps.However, I found it a little hard going and difficult to maintain my interest"}, {"userName": "TOM", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33757645-tom", "userReview": "Ekback writes beautifully, this is similar to Wolf Winter in that it is set in the same area - Blackasen Mountain, and follows a similar storyline - people are mysteriously murdered in the surrounding area. Ekback is fantastic at building up intricate and complex human relationships, conveying how the characters are affected by the landscape and near constant light. The effect that this has on personal relationships - being secluded in small incestuous local communities, and the resulting tensions that arise between closely knit yet wary nomadic Lapps and the more recent settlers.The prose is fluid, evocative and stark - at times poetic and has a vivid poignancy that runs throughout. I got hooked towards the ending as the secrets unravel and we discover the identity and hidden past of several characters. Ekback says she is going to write a third novel set in the same area, and I would certainly read this too, although I think the next one would need to differ quite drastically from the storyline of the first two, to avoid getting too repetitive.

But now we are in mid-summer when the sun almost never sets and sleep is impossible.I liked the range of characters in this book, outsiders coming to the little village and finding both unexpected friendships and indifferent distrust. Magnus is sent to investigate the deaths of three important men, but he also has to bring his wife's younger sister, thrown from her father's home because of her behaviour. The young woman, Lovisa, grows and changes through being in a place she does not want to experience, and Magnus finds secrets that have been hidden from him all his life.

Yo no.\" Aunque s\u00e9 que m\u00e1s de una persona el personaje de Lovisa le causa repulsi\u00f3n, a m\u00ed me ha cautivado por completo. Es un personaje que evoluciona mucho durante la novela, que reflexiona sobre su vida e intenta ir buscando una direcci\u00f3n. Lovisa es una ni\u00f1a rica que no se siente c\u00f3moda en la sociedad que vive, que no ha sentido cari\u00f1o ni comprensi\u00f3n y que lo demuestra en forma de odio y cleptoman\u00eda. Me ha parecido un personaje muy realista con el que he conectado muy f\u00e1cilmente. \"No, siempre estar\u00e9 sola, y lo s\u00e9. Aun as\u00ed, en todo atisbo de conexi\u00f3n, no importa lo tenue o d\u00e9bil que sea, mi alma achacosa se llena de esperanza: de que quiz\u00e1 alg\u00fan d\u00eda haya alguien o algo a lo que llamar \"m\u00edo\".

Con Magnus en cambio, no he conseguido conectar del todo hasta el final de la historia, es un personaje que tambi\u00e9n cambia bastante y con el que tambi\u00e9n conocemos la visi\u00f3n de un hombre de su \u00e9poca. Los tres protagonistas son de alguna manera personas perdidas.\"Mi padre me ense\u00f1\u00f3 que todo est\u00e1 conectado: humanos, animales y naturaleza; los vivos y los muertos. En el inframundo los muertos viven vidas que se corresponden con las nuestras. A veces, si caminas descalzo, puedes sentir las palmas de sus pies contra las tuyas.\"El ritmo de la novela es bastante lento, pero tambi\u00e9n bastante fluido. He escuchado cr\u00edticas por la lentitud, pero en mi caso lo veo como algo necesario para la historia que se quiere contar. Adem\u00e1s, el ritmo se va acelerando, creando tensi\u00f3n y miedo, y en las \u00faltimas p\u00e1ginas todo pasa muy r\u00e1pido, sorprendiendo al lector con cada descubrimiento. Me encantan todas las cosas que he aprendido sobre la cultura sami, y teniendo en cuenta que los tres g\u00e9neros que combina son algunos de mis favoritos, la he disfrutado mucho. Pero Lovisa es lo que m\u00e1s me ha gustado de la novela, pocos personajes me han causado la sensaci\u00f3n de estar escuchando a una amiga hablarte de sus sentimientos. Si te gustan este tipo de novelas, una thriller fresco diferente, algo nuevo con el que adem\u00e1s aprendas, sin duda disfrutar\u00e1s de la prosa de Eckack.

The characters are hard to get to know, although as a story about maps and characters who are all lost in some way I guess this makes sense. Yet despite this I found the writing was incredibly interesting at times as well - for example, when Magnus demands Lovisa tell him something about the town he hadn't noticed, her comment about there being no children struck me because until that moment it was something I hadn't noticed either. There is an air of mystery and magic, but this is very much a book about humans making decisions based on very human experiences. There is a quiet keening throughout the text as the mountain looms large over the village, almost a character in its own right, holding on to its own secrets and stories. I think you end up getting lost with the characters as they all start making their way in the storyline, although I almost get the impression that is exactly what is supposed to happen and strangely for a book I found frustrating for many reasons in the end left me wanting to know more about these characters and the mountain. So would I recommend this to someone?
