We all liked these three tales about Elmer and Boris the dragon. I liked that the chapters are short, good for bedtime and reading aloud. It had fun illustrations every couple page to keep my four-year old interested too. I loved that the story was fun and exciting while at the same time being so simple and innocent. So many \"children\" books have sad and terrible things happening in them, e.g. parents missing or dead, super mean siblings or peers, scary bad guys, etc. This tale is just a sweet adventure of a boy and a dragon. It made me happy."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl", "userReview": "As the author states in her introduction, the first story was written for amusement, and practically wrote itself.

To him, at his age, it absolutely is an amazing piece of literature. He would have sat through an entire book if I'd let him. Reading just three chapters at a time was hardly a fast enough pace for him. And I was shocked by his comprehension. Even at the end of the first story, he could recall all ten chapters in great detail. He studied the simple drawings on each page and soaked in every word he heard. The first of the trilogy is the best, but the other two compliment it well. I plan on reading this many more times with him. We both loved it and I would recommend it to anyone who reads chapter books aloud to their children."}, {"userName": "Tania", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2938614-tania", "userReview": "Three Tales of My Father's Dragon is the compilation of a children's series written by the author in the 1940's and 50's. The three stories that make up this collection are My Father's Dragon, Elmer and the Dragon, and The Dragons of Blueland. In My Father's Dragon, we meet Elmer Elevator as he ventures out to save a baby dragon. In Elmer and the Dragon, the boy and the dragon continue their adventures together. In The Dragons of Blueland, Elmer once more helps his friend the dragon with troubles that he encounters. Elmer shows foresight and proves himself resourceful time and time again. The stories carry with them the message that careful preparedness and a large does of kindness serve you well.The stories are told from Elmer's point of view, so there's no use worrying about what his parents think of the situation. We're treated to time spent with innocence and curiosity, time spent away from the real cares of the world such as whether or not you can truly exist on only tangerines for weeks at a time. Our hero is bold with good intentions, and he does worry about his parents from time to time. I thought it was a delightful book, filled with imagination, friendship, and good intentions."}, {"userName": "Razvan Zamfirescu", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19039516-razvan-zamfirescu", "userReview": "In categoria sa, cartea isi merita, cu siguranta, calificativul de \"clasica\". Doar ca ar trebui sa fiti cu bagare de seama pentru ca daca obisnuiti sa cititi cu placere, pe langa fictiunea si non-fictiunea de zi cu zi, si carti gen Mary Poppins sau Roald Dahl, asa cum fac eu, acest titlu s-ar putea sa nu va aduca o placere la fel de mare, de vreme ce cartea are un public mult mai tanar. Daca veti reusi sa o priviti prin ochii unui copil de 5-6 ani, sunt convins ca o veti aprecia, dar eu nu am reusit pana la capat si astfel cred ca am pierdut mult din farmecul cartii.Totusi, m-am bucurat mult sa o citesc. Impresia care mi-a ramas este ca am urmarit, cu gura cascata, un desen animat vechi, alb-negru, excelent. Prima dintre cele trei carti e cu adevarat grozava si nu ar trebui ratata. De cate ori veti mai avea ocazia sa cititi despre niste tigri care mananca guma de mestecat, sau despre crocodilii care abia asteapta sa primeasca acadele. Dar, pe masura ce se dezvolta, aventura nu mai e la fel de sensibila si nici la fel de palpitanta. Povestea canarilor care se imbolnavesc de curiozitate pentru ca nu stiu de ce regele lor este, la randul sau bolnav de aceasta boala mi s-a parut nemaipomenita, abia astept sa i-o citesc si lui Vladut cand o sa creasca."}, {"userName": "Victor The Reader", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68171410-victor-the-reader", "userReview": "Grade: A"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1530119-amy", "userReview": "All three books in the series.

(My Father's Dragon was a Newbery Honor book for 1949.) I'd read My Father's Dragon before many years ago--long before I started blogging--but this was my first opportunity, I believe, to read the two sequels.I loved the way My Father's Dragon opens:One cold rainy day when my father was a little boy, he met an old alley cat on his street. The cat was very drippy and uncomfortable so my father said, \"Wouldn't you like to come home with me?\" This surprised the cat--she had never before met anyone who cared about old alley cats--but she said, \"I'd be very much obliged if I could sit by a warm furnace, and perhaps have a saucer of milk.\" \"We have a very nice furnace to sit by, said my father, \"and I'm sure my mother has an extra saucer of milk.\" My father and the cat became good friends but my father's mother was very upset about the cat. She hated cats, particularly ugly old alley cats. \"Elmer Elevator,\" she said to my father, \"if you think I'm going to give that cat a saucer of milk, you're very wrong. Once you start feeding stray alley cats you might as well expect to feed every stray in town, and I am not going to do it!\"This opening hooked me. It is through the cat--his cat--that he learns of a baby dragon in desperate need of help. He tells of the Island of Tangerina and Wild Island. He learns about the captive dragon and the dangerous residents of the island. He is determined to help free the dragon. The cat helps him form a plan...The first book is all about his going to the islands, his adventures and misadventures as he's looking for the dragon--it's a good thing he came to the island well-prepared! Does he find the dragon? You can guess the answer to that. Of course he does! My Father's Dragon is a delightful fantasy book for very young readers. It's short and quite satisfying.In Elmer and the Dragon, Elmer starts his journey home--by dragon. His new dragon friend will fly him home. But neither Elmer or the dragon know the way home precisely. Elmer ends up having just as many adventures returning home as he did running away from home. One of the stops along the way is Feather Island, the home of all 'lost' canaries. In The Dragons of Blueland, the dragon sets off to return to his own family that he hasn't seen since his captivity. He's anxious to be reunited. But when he returns, he learns that his own family--his very large family--has been trapped in their cave. The entrance is guarded by men intent on capturing them or perhaps even killing them. He needs to find a way to help his family! So he seeks out Elmer...All three books are great. It's oh-so-easy to recommend these."}, {"userName": "Taro Yamashita", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1846555-taro-yamashita", "userReview": "I *LOVED* the first book, \"My Father's Dragon,\" from the time I was a kid. I didn't know, until I went to purchase the book for my nephews, that it was the first in a trilogy. So, I bought a copy of the trilogy for me, as well as one for my nephews.The first book is unassailable as anything other than \"wonderful\" because of the place it holds in my past. My childhood imagination and wonder are so tied to it that I cannot see it through critical eyes of an adult at all. That said, if I could, I'm sure I would tell you it's just an incredibly wonderful book full of imagination, wonder, and just enough silly and scary to spark the mind of an adventurous child.The second and third books, since I'm reading them for the first time as an adult, are fun, whimsical follow-ups to the first, and follow the pattern so typical of trilogies: trying to hold on to the magic of the first, but trying too hard to develop new things within the framework of the first, and also trying to bring the fantastic down to earth by introducing more characters who are necessarily less fantastic and more \"real,\" which tarnishes the original escapist magic. Of course, the second and third books could never have lived up to the expectations set by the first for me.... but maybe for your kids, if they read them all as children, will have a better take. One thing is for sure: whether you read these books as a child or an adult, you will want to read them to the end."}, {"userName": "kingshearte", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3031302-kingshearte", "userReview": "My Father's Dragon and its two sequels are books that Da read to us when we were little, and they're very cute. I'd actually kind of forgotten about them until I started working with books and saw them again. Then I spotted an edition of all three books in one hardcover volume at a used book sale, and snapped it up. I don't have a blurb for it because it didn't have its dust jacket at that time, but suffice it to say that it's about a boy named Elmer who has adventures with a baby dragon named Boris, who is just about the cutest thing ever. And I figured that, after Moby-Dick, I needed something cute and fluffy. So I read this, which took about a day, but it certainly was cute and fluffy. If I ever find myself in a position to have to read a kid a story (and since I'm moving into my uncle and his soon-to-arrive new baby's building, I just might), I will for sure read these books.

I don't like to push things on her, I want reading to be fun and all that, so I read it to her on nights she asked for it, which she did more often than not, but definitely not every night, so it took us a while to get through all three stories.

It makes a good read aloud--the language is right for storytelling, it's episodic, and it's pretty silly and fun.

It is still a delightful read. My favorite aspect of the book is the way that the author treats the reader with such dignity - never simplifying a situation because the book is directed towards younger readers. I also like how the book humanizes an adult by talking about the adventures of his youth - it's such a nice change from the typical treatment of adults as idiots or villains that is so common in middle grade books these days.
