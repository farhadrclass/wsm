Or so my family says. But to be this caliber of a chef liking it not enough, passion os required, the passion required to cook for sixteen or more hours of a day. That I don't have the desire to do.Saw Chef Eric Ripert on Top Chef, plus I like reading books about food, heck I really like food. He grew up with a mother who created wonderful food, had grandmothers who also cooked well, though differently. Had an erratic home life due to his stepfather.so animosity but took to hanging around a wonderful chef who took him under his wing. He could already see his passion for food. The kitchens he worked in, the cooking academy he attended, what he learned, what he did not but later learned under some ferocious chefs. The stress he suffered. All so interesting but am glad it was not me. Couldn't have withstood the pressure he did, but admire that there are those who can. A very good book on the making of a chef, a chef that can cook and create in Michelin starred restaurants. Originally from Andorra and Paris, he would make his name in the states. Loved everything about this book, so interesting and insightful, a glimpse into a world and career that I knew little of.ARC from Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/657110-beth", "userReview": "Unlike many who would be attracted to this book, I started reading not really aware of who Eric Ripert really is. I don't generally pay attention to Michelin stars or any of that - way above my budget. But I do tend to be interested in memoirs, and as someone who collects cookbooks like some collect tchotchkes, I enjoy reading about chefs and their backgrounds and training. 32 Yolks was both interesting and compulsively readable.Ripert didn't have the best upbringing as a child. His parents ended up divorced, with his father dying not too long after that. His mother married a man who abused him (mentally more than physically, it appears). Not being a stellar student, he had little interest in pursuing further studies. What he *did* have, however, was a lifetime love for, and interest in, food. From the time he was small, his mother made amazing meals, complete with full service at all times. He was exposed to foods most children might never see, and decided that in the kitchen was where he needed to be. In his memoir, Ripert tells all of this as though you're sitting at a cafe, drinking espresso and having a chat. He and Veronica Chambers, who helped write this, have such an easy way of telling the story. It's actually almost helpful, that ease, particularly when you're reading the terrible details of some of the events in his life.Overall, it was an enjoyable, interesting read about a man who has worked his way to the pinnacle in the chef world. I wish him the best of continued success, and would certainly be interested in reading more about his life as he made his way to America."}, {"userName": "britt_brooke", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1136632-britt-brooke", "userReview": "\"Still, by mastering those thirty-two yolks, I had done something right.

I like autobiographies and this one is no exception. I didn't know who Eric Ripert was before delving into this so what a wonderful surprise to hear his story. This book was so well written. I loved the descriptive quality. His life was somewhat privileged, but there was also heartache and tragedy. The way these topics were handled is what made this well written, (in my opinion). It didn't feel like a tragedy parade as if the author was looking for some reaction from the reader. It felt honest and un-doctored. I also love to cook, so that fact that he was a chef drew me right in. I felt his love and passion for food and his need for perfection, as well as his need to express himself through cooking. I was going to give this 4 stars, but I think I just talked myself into 5.

He makes good food. He's on Top Chef a lot. And Anthony Bourdain seems to think he's a swell guy. To top it off, he's always got that humble and composed Frenchman swagger. The guy just has it going on.I like Eric Ripert, and I figured I was going to enjoy this book when I first picked it up. But I wasn't expecting to be so caught up in it. I mean, I LOVED it. Start to finish, loved it. It was fun to read, and I didn't want it to end. Ripert has such a way with words (or is that his editor?). His love of food is so obvious and earnest, and the way he describes his dishes and their ingredients makes you feel like you are right there tasting them. I've never been a natural foodie (though I AM getting better in the kitchen...), but listening to him share how he loves food made me want to treat food better.What really sets this memoir apart, though, are all the personal details and feelings Ripert shares. He really puts it all out there. I had no idea that he went through so much in his life, especially during childhood. Learning about his relationship with his stepdad was heartbreaking. It's clear he has a lot of pain associated with some of the people and events he talks about, but he doesn't hide or gloss over anything. And he also doesn't lambast anyone either. Even the people who are harsh with him are treated with kindness and respect in this book, and I respect that.I just so, so loved this memoir. I finished it a couple days ago, but I'm still thinking about it. It resonated with me in a powerful way. I can't recommend it highly enough.FYI (because I can't help myself), I will add that if you like this book, you will probably like Yes, Chef by Marcus Samuelsson. And if you like food-centered fiction, I'd also suggest Kitchens of the Great Midwest.ARC received through Amazon Vine.See more of my book reviews at www.BugBugBooks.com"}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55502227-stacy", "userReview": "This a fascinating inside look from one of the world's best know chefs into what shaped and influenced him to become the culinary master he is.

If I ever had dreams of being a chef this book has cured me of such aspirations. Grueling is too mild of a word. You have a front row seat view of what made him the chef he is today.

He seems like a classy, stand-up guy and talented chef and I enjoy his friendship with Anthony Bourdain and watching them pal around on their shows. I had been meaning to read this one and since my blogging cooking group is cooking his recipes for the next six months, it seemed a good time to read his memoir. He had a difficult upbringing with the death of his father at an early age, life with an abusive stepfather that lead to boarding school and being groomed by a priest he trusted, along with other hardships-but he found both solace and purpose in his passion for food. Great stories about his growth as a cook his time learning and working the line. My only 'beef' (pun intended) is that this memoir ended as Ripert is headed to America and I wanted more.

I'm not a foodie or super into cooking, but I love a good food-related memoir. I adored the gritty brashness of Bourdain's 'Kitchen Confidential' and Ripert's own coming of age/ 'learning to love being a cook' story doesn't disappoint. It comes down to a simple story of of Ripert's pre-fame life, from his tough childhood to the stresses of learning to cook in the kitchen of one of the most talented (and demanding) chefs of the last century. Beautifully written in a way that will make you really feel Ripert's love for food - not just the mechanics of cooking, but when it comes down to it, his unabashed true love for good ingredients and the family love that make meals the most delicious."}, {"userName": "Ola", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15394322-ola", "userReview": "Fascinating coming-of-age story of a boy becoming a man, finding his passion and learning to cook and how to be a professional chef.This is a story of beginning of long way that Eric Ripert had to take to become an amazing chef of a three star restaurant.

Work in a kitchen is so difficult, so physically and mentally exhausting it amazes me that so many people decide to embark on this journey to become a professional chef.

I am one who eats to live, as opposed to living to eat. I\u2019m a far cry from a foodie and am looking forward to the culmination of the chevre craze when I can eat a nice beet salad without encountering that most unpleasant of surprises. I've hunted for my share of chanterelles in the coastal forests of Oregon because I am all about fresh food. But I'd just as soon buy a handful of baby bellas, slice them up, and call it a day. And then suffer through my family's complaints that there are mushrooms in the sauce, of course, even though I repeatedly remind them that they mostly add texture and you can\u2019t even taste them, really. All likewise things considered, I'd never heard of Eric Ripert before reading this book for my book club. I've never watched Top Chef or any other cooking show for that matter, although yesterday I did watch a YouTube video of my friend's Italian mom making her meatballs and gravy and I do plan on trying my Irish hand at that because, well, corned beef and cabbage is great, but then there are the other 364 days of the year. I am now sufficiently intrigued by the catchy title of Ripert\u2019s show and a cookbook or two, Avec Eric, which I learned about on the back cover flap. And I didn't even notice his handsome smiling visage on the back cover until I closed the book for the very last time, which might have otherwise enticed me to have searched for him on the tv. All in all, this book made me feel like I've never eaten anything. Certainly nothing that exists between its covers, including Ripert's simple French childhood snacks. And even though I've been cooking for the ever-changing, mushroom-disliking crowd I've lived with for over 30 years, I also felt like I've never cooked anything, either. My happiest days are when a crock-pot has been sitting on my counter, fungi-free cooking all day, and I\u2019ve earned a giant checkmark for having already conquered that dreaded daily question, \"What's for dinner?\" Alas, SPOILER ALERT, there are no crock-pot recipes in this book. And now that I think of it, the timeline of this book ends with Avec Eric still in his early twenties, so who knows? Three decades later, he\u2019s probably knocking off a macaroni and cheese here and there for his own kids. Once upon a time, I, too, made a successful souffl\u00e9.I do value the family dinner hour and our dining table does include a box of Table Topics, which we regularly use to enhance our dinner conversations. But even though we are regaled with tale after tale of how Ripert and his kin worship the fine art of table setting, even when camping or climbing a mountain, the book did nothing to educate us as to the actual reason why each piece of silverware is properly parked in its respective place. Nor did it explain the actual use for things like the many unique heirloom pieces that hang on a spoon rack in my dining room as opposed to being called into service because, well, who really needs a strawberry spoon? Regardless of function or rationale, at dinnertime in my house, my demands for demonstrations of this art form typically result in complaints, not appreciation. I'd never heard the term oenology, which he casually tosses out, but I just Googled it and it means the science and study of wine and wine making. You're welcome. Just as reading Into Thin Air cured me of ever wanting to climb Mt Everest, 32 Yolks serves as an excellent example of why climbing to the top of the chef world is yet another equally painful endeavor littered with the remains of those who attempted but succumbed that I can safely say I\u2019m never going to do. The mere thought of cooking for 18 hours a day makes me want to go back to bed and dream of dancing sugarplums. Ditto for creating 90 perfect dots of alternating sauces around the rims of each plate. Most of my plates are chipped around the edges so I'm fairly certain no number of alternating ketchup and brown sugar glaze dots would elevate the presentation of my famous Easter ham all that much. One passage I marked involves fresh peas. I love fresh peas and look forward to them every June. Fresh peas are the harbinger of fresh summer produce, a sacred vegetable worthy of worship, which I do. I could wax poetic about them for days. Fresh peas serve as a reminder of my own mom, who taught me to buy a pound per person. And even though they get more and more pricey each year, they're a luxury I gladly afford, a fine dining experience the promise of which gets me through winter. Priceless. They also serve as a reminder of my grandmother, Mimi, who lives in my head, instructing me to parboil them \"just until the skins wrinkle\", after which we drain them and add the New England equivalent to 32 yolks\u2014milk and butter\u2014then season them with the Irish equivalent of Herbes de Provence\u2014salt and pepper\u2014reheating gently and serving in bowls with a plain old spoon, the bigger the better. Simple, sweet, and delicious. In this book? Not so much. Have a read here as the author recounts this vignette about his boss, the renowned 3-star (or, in 3-letters, OCD) chef: \"When he told us that he wanted every single pea peeled to reveal the tiny germ inside, we thought it was madness, but we did it. If you were to peel a fresh pea right now, you would see that inside the shell, there is a very tiny sprout attached to every pea. Robuchon wanted us to take off that tiny sprout, because he believed it would add just a hint of bitterness to the dish.\" It\u2019s true that as pea season progresses and the peas get a bit older, they do lose their tenderness and taste bitterer so, alas, perhaps this tiny sprout is to blame. Nevertheless, I can\u2019t imagine peeling even one pea. Right? Emptying the pods and trying to prevent my kids from eating them all raw is hard enough for me. I highly doubt I could press them all into service peeling them. I wouldn\u2019t know which knife to use or if I even own the correct blade for this persnickety task. But to take this home just one more time, my own family lore includes the legend of Mimi\u2019s cousin, Beryl Cram, who, when eating her peas, was said to have spit the skins out. The recounting of this Table Topic every spring as we gather around the table to enjoy our dishes of peas in milk never fails to elicit both laughter and wonder, begging so many questions. How long did it take her to eat an average sized serving? What was her technique and how had she mastered it? Where, exactly, did she spit the skins, given her proper, finishing school society? Was there a special spoon for this? Is it hanging on our wall? After reading this book, I have to wonder if poor Beryl was dining about a century ahead of her time. Certainly Robuchon, Ribert, and the other poor pea-peeling chefs will be added to our annual retelling of Beryl\u2019s pea-eating proclivities, but I\u2019m honestly sorry that she never enjoyed this dish. As far as we know. It would have saved her so much time and effort, after all. Perhaps Robuchon is Beryl, reincarnated! As for me, reading this passage made me wish I could have dined at his restaurant, just once, so I could send this dish back to the kitchen and demand that the pea skins be restored to my plate. Because, well, what about nutrition? Everyone knows the skins and, yes, the sprouts, too, contain the mother lode of nutrients. But this fine food is not designed for those eating to live, I suppose.Read this book and discover your own inadequacies. Or not, as the case may be. And if you\u2019re in search of a new kitchen or family to cook for, my door is always open. This includes you, Eric, if you're listening. Any meal I don\u2019t have to cook is fine enough dining for me. Oh, and if you are, one final thing. I did wonder whatever happened to your horrible step-father. Did your lovely mom finally leave him? I hope so. I like to imagine that he\u2019s been consigned to a special kind of hell where the dining options are limited to Twinkies or Hot Pockets. Alternately, if did show up at Le Bernardin, would you welcome him in for dinner? If so, I\u2019d like to suggest that you make him peel his own peas.

When Ripert was only fifteen, he began culinary school and with a bright future ahead, started training in one of France's oldest, most beloved restaurants. When the opportunity struck to move even further up the ladder, Ripert jumped at the chance, not realizing the stakes. The years spent working extremely long days under the watchful (and often times physically abusive) eye of a famous French Chef paints an interesting portrait of what it takes to be truly great at a craft.

No spoilers, but I strongly sympathized with young Eric, even when he was being a bit of an entitled prat.

The celebrity chef story has become but a bullet point on a resume. Eric Ripert is no exception. If every one of us penned our life story and attempted to publish it for the sake of sales, there would be a lot of boring books out there. The only chef memoir I have ever read that impressed me was Anthony Bourdain\u2019s and he actually wrote it himself. I believe he was also the one to start this chef-as-writer trend. Ripert\u2019s story extends back to his humble beginnings. He recounts life with a narcissistic mother and abusive stepfather and how his passion for cooking was ignited. His respect for quality of ingredients and presentation was honed at a young age, learned from his mother who always insisted on the best of everything and his grandmother, an untrained intuitive cook. The reader is led along a slow, arduous journey through personal family details, culinary schools, his early days cooking in restaurants along with all the abuses suffered, self-inflicted and otherwise.Noteworthy, life altering stuff happened to him as it does to us all. We all have a story however our stories don\u2019t necessarily require a book. His accepted abuse at the hands of his mentor chefs, one in particular, bring to mind a beaten dog who blindly returns for more and more. This abuse ranging from physical to mental runs rampant in the culinary world but it doesn\u2019t make it right. I did find the all-consuming deep dive into his craft somewhat fascinating. What does it really take to be the best at something and what are the consequences of paying that price? The problem is that for someone with so much inner drive, I don\u2019t buy that he could not search out kinder, well-adjusted educators.Ripert exists as two sides of a coin, paying the price for culinary greatness with the currency of abuse, PTSD, untold stress, loss of self-respect, and diminishing health. That is too high a price to pay for something that I believe could be achieved other ways. Ripert\u2019s story is really more of a production, not a book. I could feel the lack of his presence in his own story, one that was ultimately written and in this case, audio-performed by an actor.Chalk this up to yet another outrageous chef\u2019s tale about \u201cwhat it took\u201d to get to their exalted status.

The winner of four James Beard Awards, co-owner and chef of a world-renowned restaurant, and recipient of countless Michelin stars, Ripert embodies elegance and culinary perfection. But before the accolades, before he even knew how to make a proper hollandaise sauce, Eric Ripert was a lonely young boy in the south of France whose life was falling apart.Ripert\u2019s parents divorced when he was six, separating him from the father he idolized and replacing him with a cold, bullying stepfather who insisted that Ripert be sent away to boarding school. A few years later, Ripert\u2019s father died on a hiking trip. Through these tough times, the one thing that gave Ripert comfort was food. Told that boys had no place in the kitchen, Ripert would instead watch from the doorway as his mother rolled couscous by hand or his grandmother pressed out the buttery dough for the treat he loved above all others, tarte aux pommes. When an eccentric local chef took him under his wing, an eleven-year-old Ripert realized that food was more than just an escape: It was his calling. That passion would carry him through the drudgery of culinary school and into the high-pressure world of Paris\u2019s most elite restaurants, where Ripert discovered that learning to cook was the easy part\u2014surviving the line was the battle.Taking us from Eric Ripert\u2019s childhood in the south of France and the mountains of Andorra into the demanding kitchens of such legendary Parisian chefs as Jo\u00ebl Robuchon and Dominique Bouchet, until, at the age of twenty-four, Ripert made his way to the United States, 32 Yolks is the tender and richly told story of how one of our greatest living chefs found himself\u2014and his home\u2014in the kitchen.", "title": "32 Yolks", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "average": 3.85, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1527168307l/40203910.jpg", "reviews": 408, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/95529.Eric_Ripert", "name": "Eric Ripert"}], "type": ["Food and Drink", "Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Biography", "Food and Drink"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3119978-on-the-line", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9381486-avec-eric", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164433.A_Return_to_Cooking", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23380604-le-bernardin-cookbook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
