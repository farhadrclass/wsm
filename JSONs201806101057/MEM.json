When most of the Mems become nothing but the trauma they\u2019ve experienced, why is our lead different? What makes her so?[This novella is one of the most philosophical I\u2019ve ever read, maybe.]The thing I liked about this, specifically, is that MEM doesn\u2019t try to force an easy answer to the questions it raises. Because Bethany Morrow knows there isn\u2019t one to all of these questions. Is it better to remove trauma or live with it? How can we judge those who made one choice or another in their struggle to remove trauma? How can we know that people who seem to be acting on memory alone are truly not their own people? And perhaps it seems like an odd message, but our pain, our fear, our hurt, our ability to deal with the above - they make us who we are. We don\u2019t need to be grateful for our pain, nor should we be, but learning to cope with it is part of what makes us human. This is reflected through the protagonist, a Memory herself, and through almost every side character.I will say I was not a fan of the romance - there\u2019s a bit of a power dynamic between them I wasn\u2019t a fan of. But I think Bethany Morrow handles it quite well, to the point where it\u2019s challenged multiple times, which made me feel a bit better. And let\u2019s be real: \nit was so interesting.\n On the whole, this is a compelling, interesting story about people, with all our flaws, and asks us to question our future.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7263033-emily", "userReview": "Ridiculously, unfathomably good.

Now I suppose I\u2019ll live like one.\nWith that opening sentence begins one of the best stories I\u2019ve read. MEM is a historical speculative fiction novella that presents an interesting world\u2013what if you could extract memories and moments and maintain them as keepsakes of sorts? Pieces of yourself, who look like you, created for a specific reason. At first glance the concept reminded me a lot of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which was why I was drawn to this little book.We meet Elsie, who is the first of a woman named Dolores. However, unlike other MEMs, Elsie is able of creating new memories, so she is fully equipped to live a life as her own self, rather than someone else\u2019s shell. Scientists cannot explain why she is different, and she is content enough with living on her own as a scientific mystery, until her Source asks her to go back to the Vault\u2013the facility where MEMs are stored\u2013so she can be reprinted. What follows is a story that is short, but that packs the perfect amount of philosophy that such a plot needs to sustain itself, and that never leaves any holes. Usually when I read short stories or novellas I feel like I could do with a little more; I find it hard to believe that it\u2019s possible to properly develop fully dimensional characters and an engaging plot in 150, 200 pages. But here comes this author proving me completely wrong, because I thought the length of this story never worked to its disadvantage. If you\u2019re a fan of the book/movie  Never Let Me Go, you\u2019ll definitely enjoy this one. I was completely immersed. The author was so, so good at making me feel\u2013everything. Not once was the story trying to force emotions out of me, it just went along with Elsie\u2019s musings and she was such an interesting, dynamic person, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like she was roping me in. By the time we were done, I knew her, and by knowing her I felt like her story affected me in a way that hasn\u2019t happened to me in a while. It\u2019s a book you might read in one sitting, although that proved to be a bit difficult for me. Not because of anything that I found distasteful in the story, but because it constantly prompted me to think. It brings up questions about what is consciousness, exactly, and to what extent does our memory serve us, and every now and again I had to slow down to properly digest this. And also I simply did not want it to end. Finishing it was a bittersweet experience. I won\u2019t be surprised if this ends up making it to my favorites of all time shelf. I need to sit with it for a little more time. For now, however\u2013I can honestly say I absolutely love it."}, {"userName": "Mya", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10909442-mya", "userReview": "This slim novel packs a huge philosophical punch. At times it feels a little too blatantly moralistic, but in general the author does a fantastic job of weaving together threads of ethics and empathy into describing the life of an entity that challenges the parameters of the technology that created her.

Her own first memories are of a lab, where she proved to be exceptional among her fellow Mems. Eventually granted a tenuous sort of freedom, Elsie spends years living in 1920s Montreal, as an oddity and a celebrity, but always, first and foremost, as someone's property. But her recall to the lab after she's grown accustomed to independence throws everything about Elsie and her place in the world into question.This book is a rare treat--the sort of narrative that requires the reader to work to keep up with it. Past and present blur together and everything means *something*. Elsie's narrative voice is stand out--often clinical, due to her upbringing and background, it still shines with a capacity for wonder and Elsie's own unshakable sense of self.The nuanced exploration of what memories are and who we are without them, as well as what makes us human, never panders, never spares the reader's sensibilities, and never flinches from the truth. And the ending. OH, the ending. A perfect, beautiful, and devastating pay off caps this truly remarkable book. One character says of Elsie, \"None of us will ever be free of you, even when we're gone,\" and when you've finished MEM, you're sure to feel the same way. I can't recommend this book highly enough."}, {"userName": "Kira", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7335577-kira", "userReview": "*received an ARC for review*I'm not quite sure what I read.

In turns, I found this novel about how the rich and wealthy rid themselves of disturbing memories by having them removed into replicas called 'Mems' an intriguing concept, a thought piece. The evocative setting of Montreal at the turn of the last century, an island in the middle of technological revolution gone slightly awry helped make the novel strange and wonderful-- as did the main character Dolores/Elsie a 'Mem,' who is the one Mem more than her memory. \nI do wish that there were more commentary on race and class (this author even addresses the lack of it in an end note -- it's clearly not the novel she wanted to write). But Morrow has written a very slim novel filled with some big ideas of how personal memory shapes us, even makes us strong, and certainly human. I hope in the future that she may explore historical memory, which seems so lacking in today's political body-- at least in the United States.

I wish there was more about Montreal in the twenties or Dolores' memories before Elsie and Else's memories after... Like there was just so much room to tell me more!But other than that it was a well written, compulsively readable book. Very pleased with it and will recommend it to others. Glad I preordered.
