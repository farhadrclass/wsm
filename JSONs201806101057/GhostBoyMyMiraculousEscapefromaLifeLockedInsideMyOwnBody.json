Unseasoned food, too-hot coffee (fed through a straw) and being positioned with his testicles trapped under him in his wheelchair. Also that having to watch Barney loving everyone on the care home tv was driving him mad.The author fell into a vegetative state at age 12 and started to come round at 16, but it was not until he was 19 and a carer realised that he was conscious and listening to her that tests and eventually communication devices made a return to a relatively normal life possible. The author is still in a wheelchair and still uses a computer to speak, but he is married and works at a high level in computers. What stands out about the book, is the author's detailing of the abuse, especially the sexual abuse he received from women carers who used his body to satisfy themselves in perverse ways secure in the knowledge he couldn't tell anyone. There are also incidents of violence, such as when the author was given an enema so violently he bled copiously. He continued bleeding into the bath he was given. The carer dipped his toothbrush in this bloody, fouled water and brushed his teeth with it.Every week there are stories of children in care homes and vulnerable adults in old age homes being physically, violently abused. I never imagined that women would sexually abuse teenage boys with (presumed) no mental capacity though.The book isn't really that interesting. The story is not unique, but the author is, so three stars for the book, but one more for the author for overcoming everything including total illiteracy, to write it."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "Only Virna touches me for no other reason than to soothe my aching body - she comforts and heals, making me feel like something other than the repulsive creature I know I am.This book is horrifying on many levels. When Pistorius was 12, he came down with an unknown illness that trapped him inside his own body. Within a few weeks he became paralyzed. Unable to speak or move, Pistorius was a prisoner. Put into a day-home with people with an I.Q. or 30 or lower, Pistorius was still in full possession of his intelligence.Imagine being able to hear and understand everything that's being said in front of you, but being unable to speak. And being thought of as an \"imbecile\" who has less intelligence than a toddler. Pistorius lived the nightmare for over a decade - in a wheelchair, at the mercy of caregivers, and spending hours of every day just staring at the wall.It wasn't until a caregiver with a kind heart, Virna, started noticing that Pistorius might be aware inside his body and pushing his family to get him tested so that he could find a way to communicate with the world once more....People project whatever ideas they want on the physically passive and silent Pistorius. And he has no way of correcting them.I remain in so many ways a blank page on to which they write their own script.\"You're so sweet,\" people will often say.\"What a gentle nature you have!\" person after person tells me.\"You are such a kind man,\" someone else trills.If only they knew of the gnawing anxiety, fiery frustration, and aching sexual desire that course through my veins at times....I'm rating this so high mostly due to it being a touching and amazing story. A true story and a real one about a very horrifying situation and how this man was lucky enough to (relatively) break free from his hell existence. However, it was not amazingly well-written and it's obvious Pistorius's strengths lie with computer programming and engineering, not in being a natural-born author....TRIGGER WARNING: AbusePistorius has some sadistic caretakers and there is a graphic chapter about this which may be too traumatic for some readers.TRIGGER WARNING: RapePistorius is raped and sexually abused by certain female caretakers. This is graphically described in one chapter and may be too traumatic for some readers....Tl;dr - An amazing true story. At times funny, at times terrifying, at times touching - this book ends on a positive note and is overall an uplifting story. But it doesn't gloss over the darkness, terror, rape and abuse that Pistorius experienced. It's also very Christian as Pistorius turns to God for comfort and aid. Not the most well-written book I've ever read, but definitely worth reading, IMO."}, {"userName": "Esther", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5889098-esther", "userReview": "This is the incredible story of a once-normal 12 year old boy who fell inexplicably sick and became a \u00ab living vegetable \u00bb. For six years, he\u2019s \u201cout\u201d. Between the age of 18 and 20, his mind slowly but steadily resurges, while his body remains totally unresponsive to his will. To the world, including the people caring for him and even to his family, he still seems the lifeless body without a brain or any intelligence. While Martin himself does not remember being the once-normal 12 year old, he does feel that the way he is being treated and occupied (or not) is unsuitable: \u201cNo one seems to consider that even people who are thought to be intellectually impaired can change as they grow older\u201d. Not to mention the people who consider him solely an object of their perversion as they abuse and mistreat him.More by chance than anything else, one carer finally suspects that Martin\u2019s movements could be more than random and actually considers them signs. Only because of one person\u2019s close attention and conviction is Martin finally assessed and is enabled to start communicating with his environment. Over many years of training and patience and while showing a high degree of intelligence, will power and motivation, he manages to lead a life as normal and happy as he could possibly hope for ever since his awakening. The most scary questions \u2013 apart from the obvious questions like \u201cwho makes sure that carers don\u2019t abuse of their power over helpless individuals totally dependent on them\u201d \u2013 for me remain these: \u201cWhat would have happened if that one carer had not paid this much attention?\u201d and \u201cHow many people are in institutions these days who are believed not to be taking part in this world just because we do not understand their signs of trying to show us that even in the most useless body, a totally healthy mind might be struggling to cope?\u201dAn inspiring and breathtaking story, which made me cry and lose trust in this world as much as it made me smile and very happy eventually."}, {"userName": "Sal Noel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6819352-sal-noel", "userReview": "If you work with people with disabilities- specifically Profound and Multiple you really should read this book. I came in at the end of an interview on Radio 4 with the author, and noted down the title. I tend to buy books almost by chance- quick read of the blurb, or a writer I already know. I went out that week to buy this book. The story is remarkable. Imagine coming round and having lost part of your life and not being able to communicate. Not saying when you were uncomfortable, being spoken across, never being asked your opinion, not being able to make choices. Luckily, when Martin was in this state, his aromatherapist notices that some movements may not have been random and after some time he is assessed and appropriate communication devices are offered to him. I really need to read it again and I did speed read it and have since lent it out. Totally inspiring and reconfirmed my practice when teaching PMLD students.

Don't let the three stars mislead you; this will pull on your heartstrings and make you appreciate just how much we take it for granted that we can verbalize our communications. Nevertheless, the promo information misrepresented the nature of the story and made it seem like Martin was completely unable to communicate or let anyone know that he was conscious at all.Second, the narrative framing is somewhat hard to follow. Events are presented out of sequence and often without dates, so it's tricky to follow a sense of progression as Martin recovers and regains some control of his life.So, in the end, I'm torn: the story here is very heartfelt and sincere, but I think the prose needs some sprucing up and restructuring. I leave it to you to decide what that's worth in terms of a rating.

I give Martin Pistorious a lot of credit for not only surviving a devastating illness, but thriving despite it. His story is remarkable and inspiring. However, the editing and sequencing of the events in the book caused me knock a few stars off of my rating. The chapters skipped from one year to another in no sequential order, and no dates were given so I couldn't begin each section of the book knowing the time-frame. While I understand that many authors of biographical novels take this approach and provide flashbacks during the course of the book, Pistorious's method was ineffective and diaorganized. If readers can look past the structure of the book, it is an enjoyable and inspiring story about a person who survived insurmountable odds."}, {"userName": "Mary Jo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23130254-mary-jo", "userReview": "Great story for everyone to learn more about augmentative and alternative communication.

On the one hand, the story itself is unbelievably gripping and fascinating. I also do believe, strongly, that it's crucial that he got to tell his own story, after so many years of silence. That said, I felt like I would rather have read a really good third-person nonfiction account of the whole thing. Like a Laura Hillenbrand book, or something along the lines of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. I just felt like there were so many fascinating stories and perspectives that weren't explored here, and I think sometimes you aren't the best person to tell your own story, even if it's important that you do so and even though it is YOUR story. Elegant, literary writing can be truer than first-person exposition because it recreates emotions rather than facts. Still, Pistorius is a competent if not an artistic writer, and the book does get much stronger after an inconsistent beginning (he doesn't seem to know how to handle the back story of his illness that he can't remember himself - if I hadn't heard the podcast first I think I'd actually be incredibly confused about what happened) before getting a bit maudlin at the very end. Definitely worth listening to the \"Invisibilia\" episode at the very least and then reading this if Martin's story piques your interest, as it did mine."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2088010-mary", "userReview": "The ONE book I'm going to recommend to EVERYONE.

First he lost his voice and stopped eating; then he slept constantly and shunned human contact. Doctors were mystified. Within eighteen months he was mute and wheelchair-bound. Martin's parents were told that an unknown degenerative disease had left him with the mind of a baby and he probably had less than two years to live. Martin went on to be cared for at centres for severely disabled children, a shell of the bright, vivacious boy he had once been. What no-one knew is that while Martin's body remained unresponsive his mind slowly woke up, yet he could tell no-one; he was a prisoner inside a broken body.Then, in 1998, when Martin was twenty-three years old, an aromatherapy masseuse began treating him and sensed some part of him was alert. Experts were dismissive, but his parents persevered and soon realised their son was as intelligent as he'd always been. With no memory of the time before his illness, Martin was a man-child reborn in a world he didn't know. He was still in a wheelchair and unable to speak, but he was brilliantly adept at computer technology. Since then, and against all odds, he has fallen in love, married and set up a design business which he runs from his home in Essex.\"What a wonderful read!

I was so intrigued by the glimpse into his experience that I wrote to him to get to know more about his amazing story. We corresponded several times and became quite friendly. When Martin told me he was having his biography published, I impatiently waited for about fourteen months to read it.This is one of those astounding biographies that reveals the hidden but exceptional people who cope with unimaginable odds. I so intensely wanted to understand the mechanisms that are used for abnormal coping by people who endure and survive the unthinkable. My reason for rating this book at four stars instead of five is that I still yearned for more information after reading this book. I understand the authors' approach in avoiding what they judge would be unnecessarily detailed minutiae of a confined intellect - but I'm one of those insatiable people who need to know as much as I can soak up about this awe-inspiring experience and Martin's ongoing recovery.As an aside, when I ordered the book, the distributor got their wires crossed and sent me a novel with the same title (author Iain Lawrence) about a young albino boy who literally runs away with a travelling circus, from an unpleasant home-life . My review of that will appear on GoodReads as well.

I'm going to go with 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4, because I didn't love it enough to make it a keeper and re-read it.It IS a worthy book to read though. It's the story of a man who was basically \"locked in\" to his body after a mysterious illness made him comatose, then in an awakened state, but where he had no control over his body or speech. For years. I give this man credit, he did NOT go insane or will himself dead, though he did come close. He went through some horrific, but not horribly graphically described, mal-treatment and abuse at the hands of those who were supposed to be helping him, but from helping hands he really did receive help. One of those staff members saw the spark of awareness in him and helped him to bring it out so others would know he wasn't just a body with the mind of the eight year old he was when he got sick. The only thing I wish was gone into was if justice was ever done to those who hurt and abused him and undoubtably others. Not necessarily legal justice, as what happened to him couldn't be proven so late in time, but to at least prevent them from hurting others. And for legal justice if they could be proven to be currently hurting others in their care. I didn't need much, just something saying that he and his family notified the authorities and that the authorities were looking into the allegations. Though I guess if the case/s were ongoing, it probably couldn't be mentioned in the book. The story ended on such a happy, gentle, positive note. Seriously, if you think you have problems, read this book. It'll both cure you and make you see that if he can work and get to where he is today, then we can too, especially if we have less holding us back. This man and his lady are an inspiration to us all. And it is an important lesson for all. Just because a person can't speak or control the movements of their body doesn't mean they are dumb or aren't there. They can hear, think and feel. We may never know to what extent, but NEVER treat ANYone, no matter what they look like or their disability, as less than yourself. So important for some people to learn.Me included in that I tend to not know how to deal with those not like myself. The simple answer is, \"like you want to be treated, dumbie!\". I guess I'm self conscious and don't want to come across as an idiot, so I don't say anything or make eye contact (to be fair, I'm not big on eye contact with my own friends and family, so I'm not trying to be rude, but I have to make an extra effort to do so. Yay shy.) and I come across as rude and superior when I'm just embarrassed at my own inadequacy. So this book has gone quite a way to waking me up that it's not all about me. Get over myself and just be ME with another person. Again, toss shyness in the mix and it can be a challenge, but really, if Martin can do what he has done, I think I can get over my self-doubt and be a decent human being to others. I highly recommend this book to everyone, YA and up I would say. Nothing too horrible in it, but he does go into his abuse and it may be a bit much for those Middle Grade and below. Trigger warning, there is sexual abuse mentioned. Not graphic, but it is there."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Ward", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4831794-stephanie-ward", "userReview": "4.5 Stars'Ghost Boy' is the raw and emotional memoir of Martin Pistorius, who was misdiagnosed when he fell ill as a preteen and had to endure the next ten years of his life trapped inside his own body and not knowing if things would ever change for him. It's an emotional roller coaster of a book - heartbreaking and tragic, but at the same time full of hope and faith.I had seen this book around lately and thought that the description sounded incredibly fascinating. I like to read memoirs once in awhile - and this one had a pull to it that I can't explain. It felt like it was just begging me to read it. I'm so happy that I decided to give it a shot! What started out as curiosity and mild intrigue ended up being a truly moving biography that had me hooked from the beginning paragraphs. From the description itself, it's easy to gather the premise of the book - the author fell sick as a child and ended up spending the next ten years of his life mentally aware but unable to communicate due to his shell of a body. There's so much more to the story than that - it was an incredibly emotional book that had my heart breaking for Martin in one section, and then I'd be smiling because of the kindness shown to him from various staff he's encountered and his family's unconditional love and support. It was terrible to read about the time the author was stuck inside his body - he was fully alert and aware of everything going on around him, yet he couldn't let anyone know that he had come back from the darkness because his body was basically useless. It really made me stop and think about what I would do if I was in his situation - the idea seriously horrified me. I don't know how he made it through - not just a small amount of time, but an entire decade! I can only imagine how scary it must have been at first - which then led to frustration, anger, and the realization that this may be the way he has to spend the rest of his life. Alert, aware, alive - but so alone.This story isn't meant to be one of despair, but one of hope and resilience. The parts in the book where Martin speaks of his time alert but unable to let anyone know - literally trapped inside his body - gave way to several emotions for me; mostly the horror of having to face such a thing, along with admiration for the author and his perseverance, the hope that he never lets die out, and the wonderful support of those who loved and cared about him. I found it interesting that the author claimed that he felt God with him during this experience - even though he had never been a religious person. That's another part of the book that made me stop and think for awhile. It's unbelievable what the author had to endure - and continues to go through on a daily basis. Yet he never gave up and continues his life today with that same kind of positive outlook and hope for the future. This is a memoir that everyone should read - it's one of universal truths and topics, so readers of all kinds will be able to relate to both the author and his story. It will definitely make you stop and think, and to be grateful for the life that you've been given - it puts a lot of things in perspective (at least it did for me). I very highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys biographies and memoirs along with anyone who wants a remarkable story full of raw emotion and undying hope.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book from the BookLook Bloggers Program in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/849475-barb", "userReview": "A truly inspirational story, I loved listening to Martin Pistorius's memoir. Martin was a healthy twelve year old boy when a mysterious illness left him in a coma-like state. This is the story of how, with the love and devotion of his parents and one very important caregiver, he \"came back to life\" years later.While parts of the story are difficult to listen to, the whole of it is uplifting. It broke my heart thinking about his parents and their battle to get help for him and also cope with the caregiving he needed. This is the first audiobook I've listened to narrated by George Guidall and I loved his voice, he's a wonderful reader. I missed the sound of his voice when the book was over. I also missed hearing about what was going on in Martin Pistorius's life. He's an amazing person, I hope he lives happily ever after. I was a little disappointed that there was no mention of what the doctors think caused his illness or how common or uncommon diseases like this are. I'd love to read an updated memoir on what he's done since the end of this book."}, {"userName": "Barb McKinley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36021416-barb-mckinley", "userReview": "What a great read. Author, Martin Pistorius gives a glimpse into the life of a boy that succumbs to illness and wakes up after 4 years trapped in a body that won't move or speak. This is his amazing journey back to earth.Mr. Pistorius'writing style is easy to read with a definite gift for keeping an autographical book interesting. I would like to see Mr. Pistorius write some type of fiction. I rarely read non-fiction but his story intrigued by what I saw in a news piece.I am so glad that I took the time to read Mr. Pistorius' book as it is a story of hope and triumph of the human spirit. This book reminds me to be grateful for what God has given me. I am really happy to recommend this book to anyone that enjoys autobiographical book or books that are just really good....KUDOS Mr. Pistorius on a triumph of the human spirit, I truly admire you for your bravery. This is a good book."}, {"userName": "Elisabeth Manley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29126442-elisabeth-manley", "userReview": "Finally! This may have gotten a 4 if it didn't take me so long to get through but I just broke it up too much, blame school ruining all my fun reading time. I liked that we got to follow Martin through his journey and accompanying pictures through those times so that by the end you really appreciate the happy ending and can understand the struggles he went through to get there. I wish I knew more about his progressions and changes in daily abilities near the end where the focus shifted mostly to his lovelife. But from a healthcare perspective it was a really interesting read to hear his good and bad/HORRIBLE interactions. Definitely recommend."}, {"userName": "PuPilla", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5443187-pupilla", "userReview": "Rem\u00e9ny. Rem\u00e9ny.
