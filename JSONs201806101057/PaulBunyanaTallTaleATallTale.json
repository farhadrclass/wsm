This book tells the story of Paul Bunyan and his blue ox, Babe. Paul Bunyan is known for his extraordinary size and strength that he obtained during his whole life. The story begins by taking us through Paul Bunyan's adventures as a child and continues to tell the audience the stories of Paul Bunyan and the other lumberjacks as they make their way across the United States. It even includes tall tales of Paul's involvement in creating the Grand Canyon, Great Lakes, and Rocky Mountains. This book can be described as a tall tale because it focuses on a character and a storyline that is \"larger than life.\" The character of the book himself has indescribable strength and size which creates more interest in the readers. It can also be described as a tall tale due to its historical background to it. Although the character and the story itself may seem blown out of proportion, it grabs the reader's attention and keeps them interested. This book would be great to read to children because it is extremely fascinating and also pushes kids to make a change in the world. We are obviously not able to do many of the things Paul Bunyan was able to, but it shows that even after being neglected, we can still make a difference in the world. I think as a teacher, this is definitely a must have in the library in the classroom."}, {"userName": "Madison Siegle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10152301-madison-siegle", "userReview": "This book was a tall tale category book, and I\u2019m really glad I read it. I\u2019ve seen it on shelves before and have heard the name, but never actually the story. The exploits were interesting, it was cool to finally know what everyone was talking about and one of the world's greatest lumberjacks in the U.S.\u2019s history.The story was engaging. The illustrations were humorous and added to the story which I liked a lot. I think kid\u2019s books, even when read by adults, should still have nice images in them to move the story along. But what was most intriguing to me of all and what made me love the story is the way Paul bonded with the animals. When he found Babe the Ox and all the other times he\u2019s kind, it made my heart warm. I love when stories con make coexistence between humans and animals, especially in children\u2019s books or stories."}, {"userName": "Anthony", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64546808-anthony", "userReview": "how he bonded with the animalsamazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111111111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Austin W", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64547280-austin-w", "userReview": "i love it when he finds babe the ox"}, {"userName": "Bobby W", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64764896-bobby-w", "userReview": "it was funny"}, {"userName": "Carterl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64794938-carterl", "userReview": "very funny"}, {"userName": "Jolene Aho", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36318545-jolene-aho", "userReview": "\u201cPaul Bunyan\u201d by Steven Kellogg is a tall tale about the folk hero Paul Bunyan. The illustrations in the book are very detailed and humorous. The story tells about how Paul was born in Maine, but the family ends up moving west, because young Paul\u2019s strength and enthusiasm for logging are causing problems in town. Paul saves an ox from a blizzard and names him Babe. The story chronicles Paul and Babe\u2019s adventures as they travel across the United States with a logging crew. Some of the incredible feats that Paul is credited with include digging the Great Lakes and Grand Canyon and \u201cshaving\u201d the slopes of the Rockies. This book is an example of traditional literature, because it is a story that has been passed down and adapted over many years. It is a tall tale, because the main character is a hero who accomplishes outlandish feats. For example, it says \u201cPaul took a few days off to dig the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes\u201d. This book has a grade level equivalent of 3.8 and would be most appealing to Kindergarten to 2nd or 3rd grade students. Because the illustrations are so detailed and integral to the story, it would be important to make sure students could all see them. A doc cam could be used, or the book could be read to small groups of students. When reading this book, a teacher could show students a map of the United States and help them locate the places mentioned in the book. Students could also explore the character traits of Paul Bunyan or compare him to a character in another story. It would also be interesting to compare and contrast different versions of stories about Paul Bunyan."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23785775-julia", "userReview": "Steven Kellogg has always been a wonderful author to read whether he is covering just a regular children story or one of the many tall tales of this country. What helps to make his work so endearing is his whimsical artwork that mixes the silly with the interesting. Within this tall tale relating to Paul Bunyan and the big blue ox Babe readers are introduced to one of the world's greatest lumberjacks that United States knew of. Bits of the story I had heard before in the legend of this mighty man while there are others that I am not quite sure they were a part of the story or not but it makes it even better to enjoy. The best thing out of the book like many of his is noticing the details of his illustrations. Some of the details are funny such as the cow seems to have an extra teat when he is milking her and if you look closely at the cats gathered underneath (why so many cats?) then you will see one that looks like it is a drunken bliss. Kellogg also included a library in the moving camp of Bunyan and the naming of the Screach sisters was also a good pun. This is one book that children will definitely enjoy as they get a chance to learn about some of the tall tales that were once told within this country."}, {"userName": "Evelyn", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5167625-evelyn", "userReview": "It's a funny story and the art work is great."}, {"userName": "Aurora", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64453530-aurora", "userReview": "Kellogg, Steven. Paul Bunyan (1984). This 20th Anniversary Edition of Paul Bunyan is a tall tale retold and illustrated by Steven Kellogg. It\u2019s in picture book format which optimally relates the tall tale of folk hero Paul Bunyan, through the beautifully and detailed illustrations that showcase the exaggerated adventures and his extraordinary strength from his childhood in Maine to his adult life across the country. As a child he began contributing to the family business by ripping out trees from the ground with his bare hands and lifting them into the lumber wagons. He had amazing speed and agility too that allowed him to race with deer and wrestle with grizzlies. We learn about him rescuing and adopting his ox calf named Babe that accompanies him in his many adventures in the early 1800s. For example, he takes a few days to dig the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes so that Babe can pull barges of Vermont maple syrup that would feed his giant flap jack eating lumber crew. These wonderful meals fueled their work and helped them level the Great Plains and shave the slopes of the Rocky Mountains. All along, as they travelled west, they cleared the way for people to settle towns across the United States until they reached the Pacific Ocean. The tall tale ends with Paul Bunyan travelling north in search of new areas of untouched wilderness and possessing an unusual and extraordinary longevity. The last two pages are a map of the United States that recount Paul Bunyan\u2019s adventures and tremendous feats throughout the country. I recommend this to teachers and parents of children of the ages 6-9 years old. They will find Kellogg\u2019s version of this tall tale and illustrations both enjoyable and informative. Teachers can use it as an example of tall tales and American folklore, as well as character development and even geography."}, {"userName": "Teegan Hite", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76252265-teegan-hite", "userReview": "Paul Bunyan, a Tall Tail, by Steven Kellogg, is an example of traditional literature and it tells the story Paul Bunyan, the biggest baby ever born and how he helped level and prepare the land for people to travel west. This book could be classified under the subgenre of a tall tale because its main character, Paul Bunyan, and all of his accomplishments are exaggerated far out of reason, but this makes the story interesting. The book is also based on a \"larger-than-life\" character and story, which may have some historical truth to it. This book was enjoyable to read and it would also be a good book to read to children. Paul Bunyan and the way his character is explained would captivate students because his size and accomplishments simply are not realistic, but they are presented in a matter-of-fact way in the story. This makes the reader assume and imagine these exaggerated facts are true, pulling the reader into the story line.  I also really enjoyed the illustrations used in this book. The pictures are very realistic and full of rich details. They work well with story and not only help the reader picture what is happening, but they also help show the extreme size of Paul Bunyan. I also enjoyed looking at the pictures because the illustrator hid in many small, but often times humorous details. Overall, Paul Bunyan, a Tall Tail, by Steven Kellogg, is an enjoyable children's book to read."}, {"userName": "Reva Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70892918-reva-taylor", "userReview": "Summary: This story is about a very large man, Paul Bunyan. The story starts out with Paul being born in main, but the family moves out west because of the problems that Paul\u2019s strengths are causing in the town. When Paul moves to the other town, he saves a blue ox from a blizzard and names him Babe, and they become inseparable. Paul finds himself very helpful to the town and his strengths are bringing about solutions within logging in this town. Evaluation: I gave this book an overall rating of 4. I think this book has a very interesting story line, and also has very interesting and detailed illustrations that easily engage the reader. The pictures allow the reader to really get a feel for events in the story.Teaching Point: I think that this book would be good for kindergarteners or 1st graders. I think it would be good to introduce fiction and nonfiction books. I think that students could make a graphic organizer comparing and contrasting fiction and nonfiction elements within the story of Paul Bunyan. Students could then come up with their own conclusion as to whether this story was fiction or nonfiction."}, {"userName": "Rachel Hilton", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71360511-rachel-hilton", "userReview": "Summary:Paul Bunyan is born a giant, compared to the others in his community. When he grows up, he is used to help his community and to protect it. Paul is a good citizen and does a lot of superhuman laboring. He has his own personal side kick, Babe the Blue Ox, who is also abnormal because he is blue. These two are best friends and help each other out. Evaluation:Paul Bunyan is a book with a lot of details throughout the story. The author uses sensory language to describe Paul Bunyan's experiences and the illustrator matches what the author says. The story of Paul Bunyan is easy to follow and the illustrations are visually appealing. Teaching Tip:I would either use this book to introduce tall tales or to show the importance of including details in writing. This story is a tall tale about a man named Paul Bunyan; I would share with the students the characteristics of a tall tale and ask them if they can figure out aspects of Paul Bunyan's life that fit these characteristics. We would come together as a group at the end of the story and talk about these characteristics they found about Paul Bunyan's life that makes this story a tall tale."}, {"userName": "Bailey Sulfridge", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70749478-bailey-sulfridge", "userReview": "Paul Bunyan is a tall tale about the folk hero Paul Bunyan.

The illustrations were neat, until the story became unbelievable or too modern, for my liking. I liked the traditional stories about Paul Bunyan and Babe, not the parts in this book where it states that Bunyan built tall bunkhouses where the workers had to parachute to breakfast, or where the griddle was so large men wore bacon on their feet to grease it.
