We could do well to understand that trout and other game fish are entirely lacking in sporting instincts. They would prefer to dine unmolested and without being eaten themselves. I was sorting out my books today and came across this little gem that I acquired when I came to France in 2001. I don't normally admit to the fact that I go fishing, well for trout anyway. I only began by chance shortly after our arrival as John didn\u2019t have a partner one day and he begrudgingly took me in his friend's place. My instructions were that I was not to speak if I could help it; and sit there quietly, appreciating the tranquility of nature while he showed me a few rudiments of fishing. John makes his own flies but I don\u2019t have the patience for that unfortunately.With fly fishing, it took me a while to spin the line correctly but I managed in the end. Jasper our Labrador sat there quietly too, which was a miracle. If he had been a nuisance, such as leaping into the river as he\u2019s a water dog, he would have been taken back to the car. Whilst sitting there at the time waiting for the arrival of this elusive fish, I mused on the famous women who were also great fisher-women, for example, the Queen Mother and Diana Rigg.I personally prefer this form of fishing but it is not always feasible, depending on the banks of the river, the position of the trees, and where the pools are, etc. It is a wonderful way to spend a day. I did not catch a trout on that first occasion but I did on latter occasions. As for the elusive salmon, well they are meant to be at Navarrenx close to us but I\u2019ve never seen one myself. I have, however, heard of others being lucky. It's still difficult for me to kill such a vibrant creature but we all eat meat and fish, unless we are vegetarians, of course, and I'm certainly not a hypocrite. I feel guilty even now though at the idea of taking life away from a living creature.I digress of course and return to Thomas McGuane. I loved this book for its honesty and the enthusiasm of the author. It was infectious and the descriptions and tales were a true delight. He travelled far and wide in his love of fishing, and even introduced his son Monte and they set off for New Zealand and other remote places. From Montana, Ireland, Argentina, etc. in McGuane\u2019s adventures in pursuit of this love, we are shown how to truly appreciate this wonderful pastime. He also returned the fish alive to the water which was admirable.After a long period of methodical fishing, I finally come up tight on a trout. He holds throbbing for a long moment, then without any run at all is suddenly aerial. Four crisp dashes later and the trout is vividly alive and cold in my hand. As I return him to the river, I bend over and watch him hold briefly in the graveled current between my feet. Then quick as a light he\u2019s gone. In conclusion, they say that fishing and religion are closely related and I\u2019m inclined to believe that. Looking down the hill towards the roaring Saison River, yes that has to be the case.A highly recommended book."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34209361-michael", "userReview": "Rather than give you a \"macro\" review, I cover my favorite chapters of this book in sort of a micro-review fashion:Back in Ireland - is as pointed and sharp as a tack. The story is as much about a time as it is about a place. McGuane reminds us that the intersection of time and space is unique as a snowflake hitting the warm ground.Twlight in the Buffalo Paddock - McGuane takes us into a seemingly sterile (e.g., there's no fish in those casting ponds) and off-beat, urban setting in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. He points out the art as well as the pointlessness of false casting to plastic-ringed targets at a time when fly fishing is being passed up by faster, more extreme sports like skateboarding and BMX. But even in this setting, McGuane finds his perfect moment. It's a moment that draws many fly anglers back to their sport: \"The ponds have gone silver. The emptiness around the few members who remain seems to make their casting more singular, more eloquent.\"Henry's Fork - The author fishes the Henry's Fork of the Snake River with guide Mike Lawson. The essay turns into a bit of a rant with McGuane calling Idaho's Department of Fish and Game to the carpet. And like metaphoric bad-dog, rubbing their nose in a big pile of silt they left in the river.World-Record Dinner - reads like a minor treatise on fly fishing the flats for mutton snapper. The mutton snapper as McGuane describes it -\"not at all handsome, with its large and vacant-looking head\" - earns more than respect - \"difficult to deceive and very spooky\" as an angler's quarry.The Sea-Run Fish - is the most sharply pointed satire of the book, with a laser-like focus on an entire ontology of misdirected fly anglers. McGuane breaks them down into: The Rich, Old and New, Corporate Groups, Time Sharers, Spongers (which he claims membership to), and The Poacher. With some amount of after thought, he includes Steelheaders (\"The first group, distinctly, are the original California steelheaders emanating from the Bay Area.\"), lodge denizens, and the roaming sponge.I loved his take on fishing lodges: \"The lodge has the unenviable job of maintaining living facilities, waterborne transport, and guides, as well as some level of communications and emergency medical capability in remote places. The logistics underlying this can resemble what in military parlance is called a task force, but it enables one to arrive with clothes and tackle only, and depart with no responsibilities for maintenance and other ordeals of the off-season, a real luxury. The downside is that it's not cheap and you never know who you'll be bunking with.... and if you travel long enough to so-called destination angling, you will meet some unparalleled Twinkies and monsters.\"I could go on citing stories and pulling quotes from this book. But, instead I'll finish with 3 words of advice - get his book."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3565671-john", "userReview": "This book was good. Thats about the easiest way to explain it. There is a central theme to this collection of short stories, and that theme is tied into the title of the book. Honestly, I almost gave up reading the book after several of the saltwater fishing tales that were set against the backdrop of locales that I will never be lucky enough to venture into. However, McGuane's passion is translated through his writing, and I am glad I finished the entire collection of short stories.The opening story that hearkened back to Michigan, and the last story about the interaction with his son were probably the most memorable stories for me.This is a definite addition to the arm-chair angler's shelf."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6484136-nick", "userReview": "Fishing requires 100% concentration and blocks out all distractions and anxiety.

I had previously heard of this author from my Grandpa and decided to look at some of his pieces. At this point I did not know that Thomas McGuane\u2019s writing matched my taste, but I quickly learned that I would likely enjoy most of his work. After perusing his books online I decided that The Longest Silence: A Life In Fishing was most likely the piece I would enjoy the most. His writing in general is largely centered around his experiences in life and more specifically his life outdoors. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and plan to read more by McGuane in the future. This text exceeded my expectations and was most of the time hard to put down. This proves the class of the book and McGuane\u2019s skill as a storyteller since I typically become bored with text after a long period of reading it. McGuane\u2019s style and attitude seep through the pages of this book making it very interesting to follow. In this specific book all the content is centered around his life experience as a fly fisherman and how this lifestyle affected and still affects him currently. The structure used by McGuane becomes essential in helping clarify the main theme. The book, consisting of multiple essays, tied well into cohesive themes/ideas that I easily related to and enjoyed. The choice to clearly split the separate experiences into sections helped reveal and accent the running themes and ideas. This was interesting because one got to see the themes grow with him and the ideas adapt alongside his understanding of the outdoors and the art of fly fishing.I really did love this book, but there is quite a bit of knowledge in the field required in order for the book to be fully enjoyed and fully understood. This being said the knowledge by no means limits this text to the fly fishing and outdoor audience, but rather puts other audiences at a bit of a disadvantage when it comes to allusions. With this in mind, the fisherman, fisherwoman, or simply an outdoor minded person would get the most out of the themes and ideas behind the book. Also this book is a good place to start for anyone interested in beginning to explore the outdoor world and what it has to offer."}, {"userName": "Bob", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3847310-bob", "userReview": "Another collection of essays that ranged from 3 to 5+, all focused on McGuane's life fishing around the world. Some of the stories are too far beyond my experience or interest to really pull me in, but the great ones are absolutely brilliant descriptions of what is feels like to be on the water - all kinds of water - with a rod and reel, whether fish appear or not. Many times I just grinned as I relived the experiences that McGuane captured, right down to the moment the fish suddenly realizes that he is being released from your hand and can just swim away - some casually, some with a sprint! Fishing friends, this book is for you!"}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44660354-tom", "userReview": "A beautiful book about life.

One of the better angling books I've read; and I've read a bunch. Snobbish in parts, whimsical, and sad. Above all, honest.'Fishing should be a ceremony that reaffirms our place in the natural world and helps us resist further estrangement from our origins.' ~ McGuaneCome to find out, I have been the subject of evil sorcery. I find myself, the past few years especially, that I have lost much of why I fell in love with fishing in the first place. It's not about the best tackle, it's not about being sponsored by some bullshit tackle conglomerate, it's not about gambling in tournaments to prove I am better for a day than my angling kin.This book reaffirms the goodness and enrichment that can be found in angling and nails firmly and completely how the fishing lifestyle has become a charade to so many.'The sport of angling used to be a genteel business, at least in the world of ideals, a world of ladies and gentlemen. These have been replaced by a new set of paradigms: the bum, the addict, and the maniac. I'm afraid that this says much about the times we live in. The fisherman now is one who defies society, who rips lips, who drains the pool, who takes no prisoners, who is not to be confused with the sissy with the creel and the bamboo rod. Granted, he releases that which he catches, but in some cases, he strips the quarry of its perilous soul before tossing it back in the water. What was once a trout-cold, hard, spotted, and beautiful-becomes \"number seven.\"' ~ McGuaneMy angling ken has been known to be suspect. I am suspicious of my own intentions and agendas. This book has me reaching for a different sort of enlightenment. I look forward to a more righteous path.'We have reached the time in the life of the planet, and humanity's demand upon it, when every fisherman will have to be a river-keeper, a steward of marine shallows, a watchman on the high seas. We are beyond having to put back what we have taken out. We must put back more than we take out.' ~ McGuane"}, {"userName": "Dreemy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1582212-dreemy", "userReview": "This is one of the great fishing/travel books of all time. Whether it will ever have a wide enough readership to be recognized as such is another matter. This guy can describe the feeling in an angler's heart as he watches a bonefish approach a lure in the crystal blue water over shallow florida keys sands in a way that makes you feel like you have been there and done it yourself.Treading the thin line between pretension and exquisite descrciptive prose, he draws the reader into his world of fish and landscapes. His asides on people, the environment and the elusive nature of contentment make this a philosophical work of art as well as an inspiring insight into the esoteric lifelong persuit of wild fish in dramatic settings."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1439856-david", "userReview": "I'm grateful to be done with this so I can go on with my life, as I did not care for it. I'm not really into fishing, but I've read plenty of essays focusing on subjects that didn't particularly interest me. I can learn a lot that way, and most essays on such topics find ways to be interesting to those not already aficionados. I really did not find that to be the case here, and I'm fond of McGuane's writing. The language level was there, and his images were good. I like his laid back, reasonable, and compassionate manner. However, I was bored to tears. I kept drifting out of sentences because I just couldn't care at all. I guess this simply isn't for non-anglers at all, no universality in the thoughts or narrative stream, or at least not for me."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1342237-alan", "userReview": "This is, without question, one of the finest collections of angling essays ever written. A novelist by profession, McGuane applies his formidable skill with language and his unique voice (a bit cynical, a bit curmudgeonly, a bit nostalgic) to the fishing life and produces the rare gift of writing that digs deeply into the meaning of the sport without overly sentimentalizing it. I rarely read a book twice and I enjoyed this even more the second time around.

The only flaw to me was that the book lacked urgency, in a way that sometimes was a patient reflective tone, and sometimes came across as a lack of intensity. I'm not sure what to ascribe it to, given how well McGuane handles everything, including the should-be-cliche topic of a fisherman through the seasons.His pieces on permit fishing are especially outstanding."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10267668-bill", "userReview": "I'm not one to read fishing literature.
