Another reviewer said this, and I'll echo it: this is more a book about betrayal than sex. Each character is at the center of a major life crisis and must make a life-altering decision.

Nice Cover!  Top 50 Books of 2015. Best Women's Contemporary Psychological Fiction Debut. Sylvia True delivers a compelling and powerful debut, THE WEDNESDAY GROUP, a group of women; different personalities, and ages, from all walks of life, and professions, linked by one painful, and real subject \u2014presently taking over their lives, their family, and their innermost secret thoughts.  Living with a sex addict. THE WEDNESDAY GROUP,  addresses the emotional journey, the pain, the desperation, and in the end a safe haven, a place of support in order to make changes, develop friendship, receive guidance, and perspective, no matter how fearful or shameful, it may seem.Bridget, Hannah, Lizzy, Flavia, and Gail  share a secret. They are married to sex addicts. From porn, chat rooms, young girls, to mail prostitutes. How will they cope, survive, heal, accept, forgive, or begin to start over, to recover? Just like alcohol, drugs, abuse, cheating, gambling, and any other addiction . . . there are signs, do they choose to ignore them, denial, or face them head on? To stay, or to go\u2026. Each of the gals in the group use different tactics with an array of heartfelt raw emotions. True dives into this highly-charged topic  with honesty, clarity, sensitivity, compassion, and humor\u2014 for an absorbing exploration into the deep personal emotions which can create havoc on a spouse\u2019s self-esteem, as well as personal, family, and career lives. When \"their\" husbands' problems become their own. An outstanding job of character development with an array of real personalities, versus clinical statistics \u2013 drawing you in, as you become personally invested in the fate of each woman. Meet THE WEDNESDAY GROUP:  Hannah, a homemaker,  catches her husband having sex with a male prostitute in a public restroom (this was the most powerful scene, as she follows him, and in the bathroom stall, will keep you on the edge of your seat-heartbreaking).  You feel her fear and shame. For me, Hannah had the most difficult task to overcome. How will this affect her, her family? Is her husband using his past as an excuse? Were there unresolved issues he brought into the marriage, and did Hannah have her eyes open, or was she just wanting a perfect family and ignored the signs? What about diseases he may pass to her? Does she need attention from another man in order to realize she is worth loving, self-worth? How will they explain this to her children without damaging them? Gail, a prominent Boston judge,  continues to receive letters from her husband\u2019s latest girlfriend, while her husband, a theology professor, has sex with grad students. Gail is the most put together on the exterior, highly professional and intelligent, and less outward emotion. She compartmentalizes, defends, and justifies that her husband has changed. However, could she be in denial, and down deep does she really realize this as why she uses food, as an escape? Is she more interested in outward appearances? Bridget, a psychiatric nurse at a state hospital, with a husband addicted to chat rooms, and match making websites. She is the wittiest, most verbal and outgoing, says exactly what is on her mind, like it, or not. She is aggressive and emotional. In the end, she may be as insecure as the others when it comes time to being alone, on her own. Most readers will relate to her. Beneath her rough exterior, she has a heart, and slowly learns to care for the others. Loved her scene with the last F me session which backfires on her.  Lizzy, a high school teacher,  is married to a porn addict, who is withdrawn and uninterested in sex with her. Lizzy is the most insecure, shy, and needs confirmation of herself and takes her husband\u2019s lack of interest personally. She seeks desperately to understand his motives. Always searching for ways to interest him. Will she be able to stand on her own two feet, whenever her own career is jeopardized by association.  How far will her husband go, or how much will he lose before he changes?Flavia, a librarian,  is at work, when someone brings to her attention an article that stated her husband had been arrested for groping a teenage girl on the subway. He must face court, and Flavia must decide if she will stay or go. Flavia did not have a big role in the group; however, thought she was funny and loved her free spirit. With the language barrier, loved the part when she thought one of the gals needed to medicate before having sex, instead of meditate.  Also liked her idea of dressing up in heels, lipstick, and walking down the street. She was a nice addition to the group. Of course there is a lot of drama surrounding Kathryn,  the young psychologist running the group, with her controlling supervisor. Unfortunately, many women whose husbands are sexually addicted blame themselves and feel they may not be adequate physically, or have done something to provoke the behavior. As the feelings of shame worsen over time, they are less likely to seek the professional help needed to reach their own recovery. As in this case, it took a lot for them to open up, and share their shameful hidden secrets. In many cases, the male enters the marriage with deep-rooted and long-held intimacy problems which can be held in secret for years, as we learn from the novel. Glad to see this issue being brought front and center for awareness, to demonstrate help is out there. Sylvia addresses sex addiction, which is real, and widely apparent in today\u2019s fast-paced busy stressful world of temptations, and in a time when sex is readily available, through the web and other areas of social media. Even our minister openly discusses this problem, as you look around the congregation and wonder what lies and secrets, which couple, what man, or woman is hiding behind the perfect fa\u00e7ade. Loved the part when they dressed up and went out for drinks, as this was as important as the group session time, as they open up to one another!A look into the psychological barriers women are facing and its impact on their lives. An engaging novel of lies, betrayal, trust, friendship, marriage, addiction, and relationships. Looking forward to reading more from this new talented author! Judith D.

The author has even managed to make some of the husbands likeable--well, some of them. By the unexpected plot twist, I was emotionally invested in the story because I was emotionally invested in the characters.

Gail is a judge who must keep her identity a secret. Recently she\u2019s begun receiving letters from a graduate student claiming Gail\u2019s perfect husband is in love with her but too scared to tell Gail. Lizzie discovered that her husband is addicted to porn and she wants to work through it but he refuses to meet her halfway. Bridget has just discovered that her husband is addicted to match making websites and porn as well. In her revenge, she may have done something that will bind them together forever. Flavia was ignorant of her husband\u2019s arrest for groping a student on the T until someone at her work brought her a newspaper clipping. And Hannah knew her husband\u2019s secret when she married him but she thought he would stop. He hasn\u2019t.Kathryn is a young psychologist who brings these women together in a support group. They meet every Wednesday night to talk about their feelings and experiences, knowing that the other women in the group are at least able to understand. Or so they think. However each of them are at very different stages of where they are with their journey dealing with their husband\u2019s behaviours and secrets and at first, it doesn\u2019t look like the Wednesday group will even make it to a second meeting. But slowly they come to trust and confide in each other as their worlds intertwine more and more each week.I was super intrigued when I read the description of this book. I feel as though the rise of the internet has probably been the downfall of a lot of relationships. Porn is readily available and in plentiful supply. You don\u2019t need to leave the house to access it and there\u2019s both free and paid versions. There are sites where you can sign up to meet someone to date, to sleep with. You can sign up to places that allow you to watch girls on webcam. It\u2019s pretty easy to become obsessed with the internet and with porn. There\u2019s a pretty lethal combination.Our female characters are all dealing with partners who have betrayed them. In some cases, the betrayal is a physical one, they\u2019ve been intimate with other people even though they claim it doesn\u2019t mean anything. In other cases the betrayal is an emotional one. They\u2019ve been spending all their time and energy, time and energy that should be spent on connecting with their partner, connecting with strangers again. All of the women feel angry, hurt and humiliated and for most, if not all of them, it\u2019s not something they can confide in to their friends over a morning coffee. And so the support group for these women is born, with young psychologist Kathryn in the role as group facilitator. She guides the sessions and asks key questions about their feelings but it\u2019s not her job to play a very intrusive role.The women were all very different. Gail was older, with a very public and prominent career. Hannah is married with two primary school aged children, the eldest of which is being increasingly affected by the tense atmosphere at home. Lizzie, Flavia and Bridget are also married but without children so far. At first they tend to regard each other with a mix of suspicion, pity and disdain. Bridget and Gail are openly hostile toward each other but despite most vowing not to return at some point or other, they find themselves coming back week after week. Knowing that they can talk within that room and be supported by others that understand what they\u2019re going through must be quite a powerful drawcard. That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s not judgement at times. There is. But they come to rely on each other, to travel towards a very unusual sort of friendship. I really enjoyed that evolution.This could be a book that is about the details of sexual infidelity but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really about the women and the betrayal that they face by their partners and how that makes them feel. The actual infidelity is what brings them together but the core of the story is these women and how they find the strength in their Wednesday group to carry on, to keep working through their differences with their partner or as the case may be, to not do that and forge a different path. Their stories were all really interesting to me with the possible exception of Flavia as I don\u2019t really felt she was a large enough part of the story to really matter. I think she maybe just served as the character who runs away from the problem, hoping that will fix it. We will never know if it did or not.The only thing I feel is a downside of this book is that I wanted more. I felt that there was a lot left unsaid at the end of the story which was no doubt deliberate but drives me mad because I\u2019m the sort of person that needs closure. I think the story between Hannah and her husband was the one most left hanging and I found that I wanted to know so much more about his betrayal. It cuts her so deep that she can\u2019t even bring herself to tell the other members of the group for the longest time \u2013 because in a list of humiliations I think Hannah feels hers far surpasses what the other women are going through. She also has children and the impact on them, especially their daughter is becoming extremely significant. Hannah doesn\u2019t seem to realise that the careful politeness between her and her husband plus an extremely rigid schedule that she\u2019s worked out, is making matters worse. There\u2019s a huge amount of anger in Hannah and I wasn\u2019t actually sure why she continued to stay with her husband. It didn\u2019t seem like something she\u2019d ever really be able to get past \u2013 or that he would ever give up. I really wished there was a lot more to their story."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2562832-ann", "userReview": "What a remarkable story about 5 women who are married to sex addicts.

While THE WEDNESDAY GROUP by Sylvia True is an okay read, it leaves the reader with a slightly bitter taste in their mouths. Ending unresolved, THE WEDNESDAY GROUP had me asking more questions than necessary.RELEASE DATE: March 2015PUBLISHER: St. Martin's GriffinDISCLAIMER: Novel was sent via NetGallery in exchange for a honest review. SYNOPSIS: Gail. Hannah. Bridget. Lizzy. Flavia. Each of them has a shameful secret, and each is about to find out that she is not alone\u2026 Gail, a prominent Boston judge, keeps receiving letters from her husband\u2019s latest girlfriend, while her husband, a theology professor, claims he\u2019s nine-months sober from sex with grad students. Hannah, a homemaker, catches her husband having sex with a male prostitute in a public restroom. Bridget, a psychiatric nurse at a state hospital, is sure she has a loving, doting spouse, until she learns that he is addicted to chat rooms and match-making websites. Lizzy, a high school teacher, is married to a porn addict, who is withdrawn and uninterested in sex with her. Flavia was working at the Boston Public library when someone brought her an article that stated her husband had been arrested for groping a teenage girl on the subway. He must face court, and Flavia must decide if she wants to stay with him. Finally, Kathryn, the young psychologist running the group, has as much at stake as all of the others. As the women share never-before-uttered secrets and bond over painful truths, they work on coming to terms with their husbands\u2019 addictions and developing healthy boundaries for themselves. Meanwhile, their outside lives become more and more intertwined, until, finally, a series of events forces each woman to face her own denial, betrayal and uncertain future head-on.REVIEW: I'm not sure if I missed something with this novel, but I didn't enjoy it. Perhaps it was the uncertain ending, but something didn't click with me. 5 different woman are intertwined by one painful secret - their husbands are all sex addicts. Alone, embarrassed, and reeling, the 5 women come together on Wednesdays in a group to discuss their issues. With secrets at the brim, the women are a mess - their husbands secret has destroyed their lives (one women has lost a job, another is left pregnant, etc), Originally completely different, these secrets help unite the women, and when their personal lives suddenly become intertwined with their Wednesday's groups, the women decide they may need each other more than they think. The novel is told from many different perspectives - in terms of the 5 women at the centre of the story, we get to see 4 of them. I felt it kind of weird, missing the perspective of 1 of the women while being so intertwined with the other 4. We also get the perspective of the therapist at the centre of the Wednesday Group, which I thought was an added bonus. The chapters are relatively short, which is a bonus, and help us get a inside look at the lives the 4 women lead. One good thing about this novel - when I first read the synopsis of this novel, I thought it would be overtly sexual. It's not (which is good!). It's a sensitive look at a problem that is very salacious in nature. The novel ends without really resolving a lot of the problems at hand. It ends with a major breakdown of one of the main characters ... and then doesn't bother to let the readers know if the character will be okay or not. Furthermore, the novel ends with some of the women running from their problems, others left alone, etc. I felt it was just so unsatisfying to read what was considered to be 'conclusions' for this novel. The novel could have gone on for a couple more chapters, in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Helen Lane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40069674-helen-lane", "userReview": "Received and ARC from the publisher.Tough subject, very sensitively done. The characters felt real to me, and I found myself caring deeply about them. Except for Flavia. It wasn't that I didn't care about her, I just didn't really get to know her. I loved how the women's friendships developed. It was a fast, easy read. I have read other reviews about the ending, and I agree it was rather sudden, but I think it was the right ending. The women have grown throughout the book, and most importantly they have learned how to support each other -- for a long time -- regardless of how messy their lives may continue to be. I also found hope in the fact that the group will continue and new members, raw with the pain of betrayal, will also find help. It wasn't clear at the beginning of the book that the group itself would survive."}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3343834-irene", "userReview": "I enjoyed everything about this book. It is a wonderful first novel!(wow -that is hard to believe!)I loved the characters and felt connected to these women, dealing with such a difficult issue.
