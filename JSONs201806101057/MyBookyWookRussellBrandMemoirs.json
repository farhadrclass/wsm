This 100% Booky Wook is a stunner! This dark ruby memoir opens with a very nice raspberry like bouquet. On the palate, Russell Brand is medium bodied, very well balanced, and smooth with delicious light raspberry flavors. The finish is dry, with light tannins that linger slightly. This is a terrific memoir! If you can find this Booky Wook, impress your friends or your boss the next time you see this book on the book list. It\u2019s a wonderful book and it would be an excellent pairing with prime rib or beef bourguignon.2. Indeed, if the first 100 days of Russell Brand\u2019s My Booky Wook have proven anything, it is that it is a hard memoir to classify. It has confounded, at one time or another, people at just about every spot across the political spectrum. It\u2019s phenomenally popular among Democrats, but has found the most support for some of its foreign-policy moves among Republicans. It\u2019s pulling combat troops out of Iraq, but more slowly than it once promised \u2014 and at the same time has laid plans to add more troops in Afghanistan than the Bush administration envisioned.3. For some completely unfounded reason, I didn't expect My Booky Wook to look particularly great. Maybe the fact that it was a comedy from the mid-1990s had something to do with it. My viewing of Booky Wook came immediately after a viewing of Rabbit Redux, another Jim Carrey comedy from the same era that looked pretty weak. Perhaps because My Booky Wook is much more special-effects driven than the average memoir, it receives a rather fine hi-def transfer. Blacks are nice and deep throughout, and the image is pretty much blemish-free throughout. No scratches or flecks here. Faint grain is evident here and there, and facial detail is somewhat weak in contrast to background detail. Even so, My Booky Wook looks sharp overall. Audio is perfectly adequate, if a little unremarkable. Randy Edelman's cheesy score is well-balanced with the sound effects, though occasionally a piece of dialogue will be drowned out a bit.4. Undoubtedly there are a large number of women who enjoy watching male masturbation - there's something about peeking in on a hot guy jerking off that is undeniably hot. Despite this, the only films available featuring straight guys masturbating were made for a gay audience. Horny women wanting to watch a spot of wrist work had to make do with open butt shots and ocassionally creepy commentary from gay gonzo film makers. That's all changed thanks to Russell Brand and his Booky Wook.5. Non-technical: Russell Brand's My Booky Wook affects chemicals in your brain that may become unbalanced and cause insomnia. Booky Wook causes relaxation and induces sleep. This memoir helps you fall asleep within 15 to 30 minutes, so read Brand only when you are ready to go to sleep. It is beneficial in providing a decent night's sleep and is out of your body in 6-8 hours so you aren't affected the next day.Technical: Booky Wook has been shown to bind preferentially to the omega-1 (BZ-1) receptor subtype of the GABAA receptor, the subtype thought to be most closely associated with sleep. In contrast, John Updike nonselectively binds to and activates all 3 omega receptor subtypes. While the selective binding of Russell Brand on the omega-1 receptor is not absolute, it may explain the preservation of deep sleep (stages 3 and 4) in human studies of Booky Wook at hypnotic doses. 6. Russell Brand's My Booky Wook presents with severe delays in all areas of adaptive functioning, with the greatest delay in the communication and social domains.The biggest concern is that My Booky Wook is not aware of its environment and places himself in a number of dangerous situations. The latest incident occurred when Booky Wook left the school during the middle of the school day and wandered onto the road.My Booky Wook greets people inconsistently. Wook is echolaic, and will repeat words and phrases. It needs a verbal cue to make eye contact when speaking to others. Russell Brand's memoir is interested in what others are doing, but will not approach a peer to initiate play. This memoir will play with peers for approximately 3-5 minutes but has difficulty keeping an interaction going.7. Russell Brand's My Booky Wook is short-legged, long-bodied -- and much heavier and more substantial than you might think. It has a silky, wavy coat that doesn't shed much, and needs only moderate exercise. This memoir is energetic outdoors, mellow and quiet indoors.However, Brand's memoir MUST have regular opportunities to vent energy and do interesting things. Memoirs were never intended to be simply household pets. I strongly recommend that you get Russell Brand's My Booky Wook involved in obedience classes at the intermediate or advanced level, in tracking, or in an autobiography club (where memoirs may dig and tunnel after small critters who are secured in a sturdy cage so they can't be harmed).More than Updike's fiction, Russell Brand's memoir needs a great deal of companionship and does not like being left alone for more than a few hours. It may express its unhappiness through destructive chewing and barking. If you work all day, this is not the memoir for you."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Works totally at hypercerebral Oscar Wilde heights while dabbling all the while with low nincompoop School of Jackass lows. It IS disarming because it is always heartfelt--this was one GrrrrREAT read!Indeed, everyone may (or may not, I don't know) have what Brand calls the \"nobstacle course\" which reigns ardent nights and chilly days alike. He consorts with the people of the underbelly, including neo Nazis, the homeless, nasty creative-genius Dadaists; drug addicts and outcasts (and, obviously, all the juicy celeb stuff he has capitalistically left out for the next one, BW2.) He floods his life with an anarchistic unprofessional demeanor, something I find intrepid and... new. There's sex in Istanbul, sex in Mali... much, plenty, a plethora of, heroin and whores, crap and crack... he pinpoints the moment good people chose to save his life--all the book's literary (for its practically Dickensian in its observations of society, modern society) tension rests in his authentic-druggie Detainment, or the Repression of, a Wondrous but Inevitable Fall. The autobio. is astute and charming, elegant and crass. Remarkable, remarkable, remarkable.Jesus, stand-up comics can make astounding writers!

An autobiography is perhaps a bit more bearable since you at least get the vaguely comforting first-person narrative of a kind of novel. Still, I'm a huge fan of Russell Brand and I wanted to give this a go. It only took me three days to finish this book, which is a miracle, considering it being all non-fictiony. I accomplished this because of the following factors; it's a really fascinating story, and I was actually curious to know what exactly was going to happen (or had happened) next in this man's life. The writing itself is remarkably stylish, preserving the very English and delightfully eccentric way that Mr. Brand speaks. I could probably put an umbrella around all of this and just outright say that this is a really great book. It's touching and inspiring and hilarious and ludicrous and appalling and all of that wonderful real-life gritty nastiness. This book is not for the faint of heart or those prone to panic attacks. He's really done some horrible things in just the 30+ years he's been alive. But that's one of the things that makes it so amazing is that he admits to every last mistake and indiscretion, not without shame, but with a kind of glorious acceptance of it. He writes to people the way he speaks to people; like you're best friends siting in a kitchen parlor. You can't help but feel like you know him, and in knowing him you can't help but love the man.The only real shame of the whole thing is that he's still a fairly young man and to have already written an autobiography leaves me wondering if perhaps he's anticipating an early demise. It honestly wouldn't surprise me, but I very much doubt that it's the case. Towards the last paragraphs of the book he talks about plans to write and publish more memoirs, I certainly hope he does. I can't wait to read them, and it'll be just like him to publish a sequel to his life story.In any case, I love Russell Brand. He's always struck me as a very sweet person who really genuinely wants everyone to just get alone and get on and I was a bit worried that reading this book would possibly tarnish that delightfully simple view of him, but it's only helped to explain quite a lot:)"}, {"userName": "Nicola", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121445-nicola", "userReview": "I thought the vernacular that the book's written in (Russell writes exactly as he speaks) would be wearing. However, once I got used to the style, I found it a quick and absorbing read.

You hate Russell Brand. You can't believe someone would walk around with hair like that, for starters. And you don't understand what's so funny about him anyway - he's just a yelly, egotistical guy with tight jeans. And what's more, these people that think he's sexy are so seriously misguided you can't believe it! Well, yeah. I thought that too for a few seconds. But then some switch was flipped in my brain and the rest is a blur of eyeliner, back-combing and too many silver chains. Of course My Booky Wook has great cover reviews from people like Frank Skinner about how lovely he thinks ol' Russ is now he's read it. Don't be fooled: they might sound like paid testimonies, but there is an actual reason Russell Brand autobiography (at 32!) is a best-seller. The reason is it's not really an autobiography. It's a 300 page confession of all the terrible things he got up to while trying to make sense of being a talented, intelligent person without a hint of self-control (and a hell of a lot of sadness to deal with). It's funny, yes, but mostly it's just gripping in its honesty and bloody revealing in its explanation of where too many drugs coupled with too much fame can take someone. Or maybe I just think he's a bit sexy."}, {"userName": "Hannah Young", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21854-hannah-young", "userReview": "I bought this book earlier last week, hopefully so I could get it signed at Russell Brand's gig on the Saturday (sadly he didn't sign anything, so it's still autographless) and consumed it quickly. I'd not read an autobiography before, and wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it - generally I don't enjoy non-fiction and it takes me ages to get through - but this one fascinated me all the way through. It completely retained all of his idiosyncrasies of speech and instead of hearing my internal-voice dictating the pages, Russell Brand's was clear all the way through.It wasn't an \"easy\" read - it's gritty and full of tragedy - but the comedian characteristically applies a humourous twist to even the darkest moments of his life (addiction, prostitutes, abuse...) and makes it strangely entertaining. He is unabashedly honest from beginning to end and embraces every exerience, good or bad, as the collective factors which have helped mould his achievements and rise to fame.I found it an inspiring insight into the reality of Brand's roots with every emotion imagineable written into this hugely personal narrative.(His gig was amazing too!)"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/777369-jessica", "userReview": "yeah I fancy him.I like the leather pants, the eyes, the attitude, the hairBut the answer to my friend's question: Isn't he a bit young to write a memoir? well yeah.he should have waited.way too chatty, undigested.some good stories, fab ones even...but disappointingly conversational.

Other than the fact that my boss loaned it to me. He was funny in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and amusing in Get Him to the Greek, but that's about the extent of my experience with him. I thought it might be more like Samantha Bee's book \"I know you are, but what am I,\" which was by no means fantastic, but entertaining, very readable, and I like her even more than I did before. Her book is less an autobiography, and more a series of funny, self-deprecating autobiographical essays. (She's quoted as saying: \u201cIt's not really a memoir\u2014I'm not Henry Kissinger\u201d). In contrast, Brand's book is a me-me-me ramble that starts with his admission to a sex-addiction recovery facility and then quickly jumps to his birth and on from there. I really don't think he's interesting enough to justify this type of autobiography. (He admits himself that he's just a regular bloke, who has become a star and can, as such, get it on with any woman he sees.) I was less struck by his humor in this book (and he is a funny guy), than I was by his ability to simultaneously feel sorry for himself for his difficult childhood (!) and his outsized ego/lack of self-perception. His upbringing sounded to me about as awful as at least 50% of the population of the Western world, with another 25% (at least) having it infinitely worse, and another 25% having it significantly better. So, I'm cheating a bit - as I didn't finsh, couldn't finish, this book.

Actually, that's a lie. I love Russell Brand. He's one of those people whom you can tell is just smart, funny, kindhearted. The book was good as far as getting a feel for Brand's humour--he's one comedian who is almost stronger in written word comedy than stand-up. (For examples of those who aren't: Tim Allen, Paul Reiser, Ellen DeGeneres.) But really, the fault lies with me, perhaps, because I don't enjoy addiction books. I'm not a fan of people turning their personal problems into \"look what a tortured soul I am!\" stories. All of us are in our way tortured souls. This was a much better book than I expected, but it still focused a lot on Brand's addictive behaviour and his terrible father, both of which are tropes I don't enjoy reading."}, {"userName": "Rosamund", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199171-rosamund", "userReview": "You either love or hate Russell.

I absolutely loved this from the very first page, when Russell, in sex-addict-rehab, mentions the forthcoming \"thirty wankless nights\". It really is written how he speaks (and I find the way he speaks very charming!), it's like an internal monologue. He has done some shocking things, but he speaks of them so casually!

I had previously heard an interview with Brand (preceding the release of Forgetting Sarah Marshall) on a mainstream radio station, and he seemed really funny. (I also remember this interview because afterwords, the DJs kept saying how they weren't gay, but they could possibly be gay for Brand, and if they were gay, they would definitely have sex with Brand.)So, I borrowed this book from the public library. Actually, I put myself on the list to borrow this book, meaning I really wanted to read it, didn't just pluck it off a shelf one day on a whim.Some parts of this book were laugh-out-loud funny. I did laugh. But I wouldn't call this a funny book. It was actually kind of depressing. Brand's had kind of a pathetic life. But although the writing wasn't all that good, I couldn't seem to put the book down. I felt compelled to finish reading it. I imagine this is how it is to look at a train wreck (especially a wreck of a passenger train): it's gross and kind of sad and gory, but it's hard to avert one's eyes because it's kind of interesting too, in a twisted way.I felt kind of gross and rather relieved when I got to the last page."}, {"userName": "Katie Owen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11558331-katie-owen", "userReview": "Real lol bits - loved it but then I love Russell Brand"}, {"userName": "Laura Elliott Monroe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4130458-laura-elliott-monroe", "userReview": "Pros: Brand has a brilliant, amazing mind & sharp wit.Cons: Scarily unfunny sections, leaves you with a yukky feeling in your tummy.The Bottom Line: Not for the faint of heart or individuals unfamiliar with British culture.I love British comedy, but outside of Eddie Izzard I'm not very well-versed in British stand-up comedy. I knew of Russell Brand and also enjoyed him immensely in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\" I knew he was edgy and also a recovered user/alcoholic, and that kind of thing doesn't sway me at all. I was looking forward to a funny memoir and getting to know Brand a little better, especially his rise to fame in England.What I got was a disturbing tale of Oedipal weirdness, self-harm, animal abuse, and a whole lot of unfunny. After reading this book, I was afraid for Katy Perry's immediate safety.OK, So He's Not AmericanBrand has a note in the beginning of the book addressing his \"American readers.\" Kindly, he sets us up for imminent failure by basically telling us that we're not going to understand a bunch of stuff in his book and he was nice enough to provide footnotes. I'm an Anglophile, so I was able to understand nearly every British reference in the book, but I'll admit that there were quite a few challenging items. If you are unfamiliar with any of the following, you may need some sort of a Brit-to-Yank translation tool (or a British significant other):- Cockney Rhyming Slang (which completely eludes me, no matter how hard I try to wrap my brain around it)- British television shows- British children's stories/TV- British radio hosts- British pop stars- British mag ragsNever fear if you don't have a dictionary (living or otherwise) at your disposal - Brand provides copious footnotes at the bottom of many pages. They're written in the style of the book, so thankfully they're not dry and boring and do help.Memoirs Can Be Tough!Like biographies, memoirs don't always show the pretty, and I was prepared for that. This, however, was painful. Brand lived with his mother and also has a very unhealthy (in my honest, non-professional opinion) relationship with her. He writes that he \"trained ... to practice seduction and manipulation\" on her as a very small child, and also suggested they get married when he was young. This rather unhealthy fixation rears its head often throughout the book, and the reader is left going, \"Eugh.\"Most disturbing was his animal abuse. This literally made me sick to my stomach. No, he doesn't ritually torture/kill pets like a serial-killer-in-training, but it was really upsetting. It's upsetting me to write about it, actually, so moving on......to the self-harm. If you are squeamish about reading of people hacking at themselves to the point where they leave scars, this might not be the read for you. It's not overly graphic, but disturbing.The Mental Illness FactorHis growing-up wasn't terrible or tough at all - he had a doting, loving mother and grew up in a house of women. He got admitted to prestigious schools (even though he messed that up) and his mostly absent dad took him on vacation (albeit Dad purchased him hookers while on this vacation, it wasn't like Brand was abused or discounted in his childhood). However, this book chronicles a VERY damaged young man who makes a complete cock-up of nearly every situation he's put into - especially with authority.He's filled with so much self-loathing that you just wonder, \"Is he bi-polar? Schizoid?\" He admits that he was diagnosed with depression as a child in school, and was casually diagnosed by a school counsellor as a manic-depressive. He admits to not going on meds for this because he doesn't feel he needs it, even though he medicated for much of his life with non-prescription illegal drugs. Anyone who's been around a mentally ill friend or family member who refuses to take their meds knows that this is a recipe for disaster ... and therefore a tough read.But Is It ALL Bad?Oddly, there were two \"heavy\" areas that weren't disturbing or upsetting to me - his childhood molestation (an incident by a tutor) and his prolific, erm, \"use\" of women sexually. The molestation was written in such a way that it wasn't squicky-gross or making you want to lock your children away from society. Sure, it's a horrible event, but he wrote about it in a very straight-up, digestible way (which is MUCH appreciated).The book opens with him going to rehab for sexual addiction, but while the womanizing was egregious (he totally parties like a rock star) I didn't find it degrading to women. Sure, there's some manipulation and two-timing, but overall you feel as if these women are consenting adults and not victims of a Russell Brand Sexual Reign of Terror. Whether or not that was actually the case, we'll never know, but he does not come across as misogynistic at all ... just someone with a bad case of the sexies. He repeatedly harps on his love of the female body and all of its intricacies.Oh, the Drug Use (and Abuse)This is really harrowing. As someone who's never done drugs but has fallen off a few barstools in her time (I'm looking at you, Guinness, right now), it was difficult for me to stomach the heroin-induced antics that Brand writes about. It really seems like a complete train wreck. I have no idea how in Hades this man actually kept a job, or even actually showed up for anything, ever (especially not on time). I was completely gobsmacked that he could use as many drugs for as long as he did and not be arrested/prosecuted, get a bad batch from a shady dealer and overdose/have to be hospitalized, OR kill someone. I'm still incredulous that he actually managed to function.And bless his friends and assistants, because they were the ones who kept him from killing himself (or worse, other people). They are the true heroes of this book. Whatever they were paid, it is certainly not even close to what they deserve for putting up with Brand and his shenanigans.One Thing That Eludes MeI can't figure out why he was in sex rehab. The book opens with him getting stuck in an American rehab facility and he eventually gets out. But the book doesn't really show or tell us why he's a SEX addict. He's a DRUG addict, and also a drunk. He never acts like his sexual behavior is a problem at all ... only when it's paired with the drink/drugs. Sure, he needs to get that creepy Oedipal thing evaluated by a therapist before he can have a real relationship with a woman, but outside from having an addictive personality I didn't see the sex as a problem. It could be because I'm very sex-positive in my thinking, and I also know that bi-polar people can be hypersexual as part of the disorder, so I'm thinking it's more of a chemical issue than an addiction. Again, I'm not a professional (although I sure seem to be able to play one on the Internet).OK, So Was There ANYTHING Redeeming in This Book(y Wook)?Yes. Brand can WRITE. He is ridiculously smart, and he is also apparently very well-read. While the pacing of this book is a bit disjointed (well, it IS a memoir his drug use/abuse) and the subject matter is definitely cringe-worthy, this man is brilliant. Even though some paragraphs were terribly off-putting, he was able to convey his memories and his life in an enjoyable way that elicited quite a few chuckles.Yes, it's a train wreck of a life, but Brand's quick wit makes the writing - not the subject matter - enjoyable a lot of the time.Although it is well-written, I don't recommend it because of the subject matter. I also don't recommend it for the casual Brand fan, anyone who suffers from triggers due to sexual abuse, or anyone who has had a bipolar/depressive/self-harming friend/family member/lover."}, {"userName": "Lostaccount", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19012180-lostaccount", "userReview": "Let me start by admitting that I do NOT like Russell Brand. But I read Revolution and thought the writing wasn't that bad and I was interested to see how this compared. At first, this book wasn't as annoying as I thought it would be, but then Russell's ego takes over and starts to ruin things. The writing isn't bad when you compare it to other celeb books. Most celebs can't write for shit (even the ones who, ironically, haven't written their own books, which is most of them!), but Brand can write, I'll give him that. Well, I take that back. I mean occasionally he can write. There is a lot of purple prose too. Parts of the book seem to have been written by someone else entirely. I\u2019m not that interest in drug addicts so the drug taking stuff was boring. I have known a lot of drug addicts and they fall into two categories, those who DON'T WANT TO DO IT and find it hard to stop, and those who WANT TO DO IT and say they want to stop but really want to keep doing it, the latter are some of the most selfish, self-absorbed, self-destructive, negative, soulless, morally-corrupt, idiotic people on the planet, which is why they become drug addicts in the first place. Brand definitely falls into this latter category. The sex in the book is juvenile and seedy, a bit like Brand himself. Frankly I don't believe him for the most part. The women were either desperate or he's exaggerating - since he isn't Adonis by any stretch of the imagination. Most girls I know: \"eewwww\" is usually their reaction to Brand. \"He looks like someone's grandmother, especially with all that backcombed granny hair\" and \"He's so laughably effeminate; I saw him in a movie recently and I swear he had boobs, not just moobs, but real boobs\" are just a few of the comments I've heard girls make about him. In the book he keeps making references to things being stuck up people's bums or his own bum, signs of latent homosexuality? If so, I couldn't care to be honest but he should just come out and have done with it.The show business stuff was slightly more interesting, but even then I think anyone reading it needs to take it a with a pinch of salt. His recounting of life as a wayward kid wasn't that interesting and not that credible either. Overall, most of the book was moronic, juvenile, shallow, seedy, morally suspect and boring. None of it was funny. And his ego, oh my God!

I find Russell Brand amusing but sometimes too obnoxious. Andddd I guess the book didn't really show me otherwise.There were experiences that made me laugh. Russell Brand doesn't seem to do normal human experiences, though. A typical Russell Brand experience included(well, I guess it's in the past now) lots of prostitutes and heroin.He was a terrible womaniser and complete sex/drug addict. At the end of the book, he seems to say that he doesn't do drugs anymore(or, at least not heroin). I found the book mildly funny. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either, hence the three stars. I liked it but was a bit bored during most of it. I guess reading about self destructive, indulgent behaviour is not always interesting or stimulating.There were stand-out moments in the book which made me smile or laugh. There were also moments that I was a bit shocked by but not that shocked because I guess I knew that Russell Brand was a bit of a wanker(literally, according to most of this book).I still like him as an actor/comedian. Although sometimes his comedy routines get a bit obnoxious, they are pretty hysterical at other times. I'm not shocked by the split of him and Katy Perry but always feel a bit sad at how short Hollywood marriages last. I saw the movie \"Arthur\" yesterday and afterwards started reading this book. I found there were aspects of that movie that were so similar to his past. But only slightly, such as being an addict and sleeping with lots of women.It was an okay book.

It isn't. Okay I know it's a self pitying, wallowing story about his life addicted to heroin and also a sex addict but you'd have thought that the 'hilarious' incidents where he disgraces himself by visiting brothels while meant to be filming TV shows etc would have been funnier. But frankly Brand does not have a way with words on paper and does not bring any of these incidents to life. This is just a rather tedious rambling book about Brands' perceived outsider status and how he finds 'dignity' in low life/druggies/prostitutes (give me a break!) and how he likes them because they are so much more real/alive etc. The only memorable thing about it is a few sex scenes which are so revolting that they will make you want to dry heave. He doesn't really explain why he is QUITE so fucked up - he comes across as someone barely human just this bag of piss, drink and drugs who indiscriminately fucks any woman that moves. Well he has been in rehab now and I hope you are a better person these days Russell. In short many of these drug memoirs make you feel sorry for the person but here you just feel your skin crawl."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1487776-kim", "userReview": "My Booky Wook is Russell Brand's memoir where he discusses moments from his childhood leading up to how he got into comedy. I wanted to read this book because I find Russell Brand to be very humorous and love his stand-up comedy. This book mainly focuses on his troubled days, where he discusses topics such as sex addiction, drug use, and depression. Although, the book was a bit challenging because it is filled with British humor and is written in a very witty way, I loved everything about it. I loved how truthful Brand was and even though he is discussing the hard times in his life, he adds humor to those moments. Most people have trouble talking about the lowest points in their life but Brand was able to make them hilarious and it was endearing to see him write about those times in such a witty manor. When I first picked up the book I didn't exactly know what to expect because I didn't think someone's writing could make me laugh so much but his definitely did. It was interesting to read how someone who had numerous major problems in his life, cleaned his act up and became one of England's (and now setting up a career in America) funniest, most raunchiest comedians."}, {"userName": "Frances", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3817259-frances", "userReview": "I picked this book up because I've read some of Brand's more serious writing. His comedy has always had a bit of the political about it, and I was curious to read his Opinions. His writing is really very good. Even if you read the other reviews: \"junkies are boring\", \"this isn't funny\", I afraid you're missing his larger point. He didn't write the book as comedy. His stories of being totally blasted on heroin aren't more or less pathetic than those types of stories usually are. His level of self-awareness is fascinating. He knows it's incredible for him to have succeeded, and he also knows he can really credit that to OTHER people and his own dogged determination. That's why he wrote a memoir. Not to say \"look at all the wild and crazy shit I've done\" (well not only that), but also as a monument to those other ones who loved him despite themselves. And, of course. His truly staggering ego.

In fact, to be honest, I was barely aware of his presence on TV, but the little I did know of him caused me to dislike him, immensely. Occasionally I stumbled across him thrusting a wand-like microphone into the face of some z-list celebrity on Big Brother\u2019s Big Mouth and immediately reached for the channel changer. I witnessed him dancing over pages of tabloid newspapers, hanging out of copies of Heat and making a spectacle of himself on whatever TV show would have him. I found him obscene, and not in a funny, intriguing way, but vilely, pitifully.One day, my feelings changed.I couldn\u2019t tell you how or why I began to like and appreciate Russell Brand any more than I could tell you why I didn\u2019t like him in the first place, although it coincided with his appearance on Friday Night with Jonathon Ross. His turn of phrase, whilst no less flamboyantly theatrical than it had always been, suddenly become far easier to respect and admire. I realised, to my amazement, that this was not another boring, stupid TV presenter who clutched at the tails of fame and begged to be allowed along for the ride. This man was surprisingly intelligent. More than that, he was charming with it. He rattled off tales of drinking, drugs, loveless sex, and yet drew the audience in, asking for love, and receiving it in abundance. He was witty and bright, smooth and unique. He was fascinating. I admitted that I had been wrong.Brand was on the show to promote his new book, an autobiography which promised to spill the beans on his eventful, destructive, rollercoaster of a life. At the tender age of 32, he has done more in his young life than most of us would ever experience in our wildest nightmares, and he has bounced back, and people love him for it. My Booky Wook is an eye-opening tale of abuse, cruelty, and fear; and that\u2019s just the way Russell treats his own body and mind. The treatment he has received from other people in his life \u2013 and, indeed, the treatment he has in turn meted out \u2013 makes for pretty shocking reading. The casual way in which he describes physical, sexual and mental abuse is often hard to stomach and he does not make it easier for the reader to appreciate the severity; but this is almost certainly deliberate. Brand\u2019s style of story-telling is a bizarre twist on the quintessentially British sense of stiff-upper-lip; despite being unashamedly free with details of sexual exploits and the exact sensations caused by various drugs, he is seemingly incapable of dwelling on emotional difficulties, preferring instead an \u201conwards and upwards\u201d (or possibly downwards) attitude instead. This can make for difficult reading, and I would imagine his seemingly careless attitude would result in many readers finding it increasingly difficult to empathise with his arguably self-imposed troubles. But I found that, despite his openness and willingness to describe everything (and in sometimes unpleasantly intricate detail), it was more what he didn\u2019t say than what he did which made the book truly intriguing.Brand\u2019s oxymoronic self-effacing vanity shines through the pages of the book and makes it the worthwhile read that it is. Others may well have experienced similar journeys, fought similar battles, and travelled similar paths, but it\u2019s unlikely that any of them could produce a book as simultaneously hilarious and heart-wrenchingly sad as this. His intelligence is notable throughout and the fact that the reader knows he has successfully navigated the murky waters of his past to emerge, triumphant, on the other side is what makes it worth reading. 99% of the book is concerned with his downward spiral, only emerging as the success he is now at the very end, and yet he remains extraordinarily upbeat throughout, and the reader is carried along with him.He is not a natural writer, but this doesn\u2019t really matter; Brand\u2019s personality shines through his words, making his account believable, encouraging the reader to follow him through his mucky anecdotes and upsetting memories. He will never be able to write a genuine novel, since I doubt very much that he would be able to separate himself enough, or indeed be prepared to make himself as invisible as a good author necessarily needs to be. But the point of Brand\u2019s memoirs is that he is unfailingly present, that he has seen, done, witnessed and performed all of the offensive and shameful activities he describes. He has come through them and emerged a surprisingly likeable, unfairly intelligent, worryingly normal man. At the end of the book, the reader, despite being armed with the knowledge of some of his more unforgivable deeds, can\u2019t help but wish him endless encouragement and wave after him like his proud mum (who, incidentally, deserves a medal) as he steers a course through the rest of his life. One can only hope that the second half is considerably less rocky than the first."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15056836-molly", "userReview": "just finished this book, finally, after borrowing it to read from the lifeguard at my apt pool this past summer. i picked it up and flipped through a couple pages just to scan, and ended up reading the first quarter in one sun session. next couple days, i read the rest except maybe one or two chapters at the end. b/c summer ended. but i finally went and got my own copy, and even though it's hard for me to read a memoir more than once, i just want it on my shelf. because every time i look at it, it makes me smile. i knew i liked russell brand for a while, he was good in a very cute movie \"forgetting sarah marshall,\" which btw didn't get enough credit in my opinion. and i'd seen russell's show and knew he was smart, opinionated, and very quick witted. entertained me. but really, until i read this book, i had severely underrated him, this book was so well written, easy flow, and so so funny. not slapstick funny. more like, \"this stuff is so funny b/c what he says is dead on what anybody who can relate would be thinking.\" this is the stuff i think about, have experienced some of, reacted like. but his ability to string words and use the english language both creatively and realistically in such a candid, think-outside-the-box expression that resonates with many of his readers, makes reading each sentence fun. but what's really funny, is not just the way he writes, but the actual stories he writes about. you can't make this stuff up. especially how it's written, so intimate and exposing, you can tell it's not been overly doctored up. it's how someone would really talk. especially in the situations he was in. he laid it all out there, and described his painful and awkward, and outcast memories all the while looking back in retrospect and laughing about them now. bringing secrets to the surface and then having the ability to laugh at yourself, about shit you wouldn't laugh at all about at the time it was happening, takes their power away and makes you money in the process. and it's inspiring to go from his early accounts in life to where he is now, and to hear his humility and how he makes light of his success too. b/c nothing is really meaningful unless you give it meaning. and he writes like he believes that. he sounds so smart, yet funny and real at the same time, a combo i don't see often. if u like introspective humor, you'd really like this book. i had no idea how much i liked him."}, {"userName": "Ulrike", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17033532-ulrike", "userReview": "Where do I even begin with this book?

She convinced me that he was a really interesting man and that I should read this here Booky Wook (and with a title like that, how could I refuse?). My cousin wasn't lying. Russell Brand's story is one of the weirdest I've ever read. I mean this in a good way, but also maybe a little bit in a bad way? I don't even know.After getting used to it, I adored the writing style; hilarious and personal. I don't often laugh out loud when I'm reading but I couldn't stop myself with some of the hilarious ways he puts stuff to paper. It's wonderful and I think it sort of makes up for much of his asshole-y behaviour. I mean some of the stuff this guy has done to people, so unapologetically too, is completely appalling, but for some reason I couldn't actually condemn him for it. He's like a puppy you can't stay mad at because he's so charming. I reckon that's why so many people kept throwing chances at him. And luckily so! Russell Brand is kind of a genius (but don't ever tell him that; he's got ego to spare). He's undoubtfully funny and he has these views on life that I can really appreciate. I also found comfort in reading about some of the stuff he went through. I suppose that, in all the madness inside this Booky Wook (and there is madness, lots of it), there is something relatable for all of us. It\u2019s quite difficult to explain. Somewhere in the book, just to set a dumb little example, the guy talks about these thoughts. \u201cWhat if I just do this thing? What if I just do this thing that I know is bad, just to see what happens? How long can I do this bad thing without completely fucking everything up\u201d kind of ideas. I can recall quite a few times in my life when I\u2019ve had these exact thoughts. It had nothing to do with drugs or anything illegal but still, you get the drift! I think that\u2019s about all I have to say for this read. I liked it a lot. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll read his second Booky Wook someday as well.

Brand's jokes are best when he's rattling them out rapid fire with a saucy grin--on paper, there's not as much to them. It doesn't work particularly well as a memoir, either. Brand spends a huge amount of time on his unexceptionable childhood, then a few chapters each recapping his tv shows and talking about how helpful rehab was. Aside from his addiction to drugs and sex, the reader learns pretty much nothing about Brand as a person. And since he's only 34, there isn't yet much to talk about in terms of his career.
