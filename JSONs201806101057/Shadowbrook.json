There\u2019s nothing to be gained in setting out to bash somebody else\u2019s work, not for me, or you, or them. If I do decide to post about a novel that doesn\u2019t work for me, the reason is usually that I see a bigger issue I\u2019d like to address. This time, in talking about Swerling\u2019s Shadowbrook, the issue has to do with historical fiction more generally.The thing about historical fiction that makes it so challening is quite simple. You\u2019ve got to do a lot of extra work, in terms of research, and then there\u2019s the challenge of shifting your mindset. It\u2019s not easy to write from the POV of a character whose life and times are so very different from your own. So first, that acknowledgement. This novel, which encompasses most of the French and Indian War as its backdrop, was an ambitious undertaking.I went and read other reviews of Shadowbrook after I had finished it, which were all pretty positive and very complimentary about the quality of the research that went into the work. Which brings me to the other, primary challenge that goes along with historical fiction. Here it is: you can\u2019t lose track of the fact that this is a story you\u2019re telling. First a story, then a history. Repeat after me: First a story, then a history. A historical novelist who lets him or herself forget this is bound for trouble, and I think Shadowbrook is an example of such a novel.Swerling tries to cover pretty much all of the French and Indian war, fit in every major character and institution and battle. In order to do that she has to spread her two main characters really thin. She\u2019s got them jumping from Louisiana to Manhattan to Quebec to the Adirondacks with little apparent effort.The two major characters (Quentin Hale and Cormac Shea) are young men connected to white slave holding society (in one direction) and various Indian tribes (in the other), which positions them to cover many aspects of the war, but not all of them. The third main character, the young woman called Nicole, feels as though she was constructed completely to fill a void in this net Swerling casts over the entire continent. Nicole, half French, half English, is on her way to join a convent in Quebec when she finds herself traveling with Quentin and Cormac. Without Nicole Swerling wouldn\u2019t have a way to bring in French Catholic sensibilities. At the same time Nicole provides a vague, underdone love interest for Quent. He loves her; she loves him but mon Dieu, she\u2019s made a promise to God.Nicole\u2019s role is to bring various priests, mostly Jesuits, into the picture. Which is important if you\u2019re determined to tell the whole story of the this particular war, because the Catholic church played a major role.Once Nicole is in Quebec she ends up playing a role in the communication between Montcalm and other major historical characters \u2014 something that requires some plot finagling, because she\u2019s cloistered among the very strict Saint Clares. At any rate, that setup keeps her busy while Quent is running from battle to battle, and trying to save his father\u2019s patent, a huge tract of land called Shadowbrook, populated by Quent\u2019s evil elder brother and a lot of slaves, all the better to examine that aspect of the war, of course.And then there\u2019s the second-string love story, which also feels manufactured primarily so the author could fit in the story of the Acadians being expelled from Canada by the English. Cormac Shea falls in love with a young woman in that community and then, determined to find her when she\u2019s expelled, goes to Louisiana. Let me point out one of the linguistic\u2026 infelicities\u2026 which bugged me the most: why would Native Americans in Canada be dreaming about alligators? And if they did, how would they know that such creatures were even called alligators? Beyond that observation, I\u2019m not going to address the matter of historical research directly, because some of what I would have to say comes down to a matter of difference in interpretation.Thus you\u2019ve got characters who are being moved around like puppets to fulfil the author\u2019s need to get the historical facts, as she interprets them, onto the page. The result is a story without a lot of dramatic tension, and certainly without character development. The characters change as historical circumstance dictates. Which is unfortunate, because I think there was a great deal of potential in quite a few of them.All in all, this novel felt too broad and unfocused to me, diluted to the point where it was hard to maintain interest in the characters at all. And of course, as always: this is my take, alone."}, {"userName": "Misfit", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1375548-misfit", "userReview": "I just loved this, couldn't put it down until the end. I, like other reviewers, learned more about this time in American history, the French and Indian Wars, than I ever did in our public shool systems (which really didn't teach us very much history at all). This book has it all, true love, honor, politics, treachery and intrigue, battles and heartbreak. Like other reviwers, most of the historical fiction I read is about England, Scotland and Wales and I had forgotten how fascinating all history is, even our own. Along with that, we had the tale of two men, Quent and Cormac who had the to wear the difficult roles of life between two different civilizations, the white man and the red."}, {"userName": "Jenny Q", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2661064-jenny-q", "userReview": "I love novels set in early America. The birth of America is my favorite period in history and I read and research as much as I can about it. I think it's a time that gets overlooked a lot, especially in fiction, where everybody seems to be more interested in medieval times, the Tudors, Regency, etc. I immediately purchased this book after it was recommended in the American Historical Fiction Group. I was thrown at first by the opening scene. The story begins with the five nuns of St. Clare flagellating themselves in their little chapel in Quebec, which I thought was an odd opening for a story about imperial war. But it turns out their order will play an important role in the story.Adopted brothers Quentin Hale and Cormac Shea divide their time between the white and Indian worlds, occasionally hiring themselves out as wilderness scouts. While thus employed they meet unexpectedly on opposite sides of a skirmish between French and British troops, the latter lead by George Washington. Turns out Cormac was actually looking for Quent, bearing a message from his mother: his father is dying and he is needed back at the family plantation, Shadowbrook. Their long journey from the Ohio Country to New York is made complicated by the young, beautiful and mysterious French woman Nicole Crane, whom Cormac has agreed to escort to Quebec.More complications await them at Shadowbrook, where they arrive to find they are not welcome by Quent's older brother John, who has been squandering the family fortune. Quent begins to think he could be happy again at Shadowbrook and confesses his love to Nicole who tells him she has chosen to give her life to God. Add to Quent's problems a land-obsessed Scotsman who covets Shadowbrook and will stop at nothing to get it, a lawless Indian renegade who has it out for Quent, and the fact that Shadowbrook lies between the two opposing forces as war appears imminent. The French are forming dangerous alliances with the Indian nations, and that's where the order of nuns comes back into play, as Nicole arrives to join them and two powerful French clergymen vie to use their influence with Indians and inhabitants to aid the French cause in the war for Canada and the Ohio territory.I really wanted to love this book...but I didn't. The historical content gets 5 Stars from me. Lots of information on French Canada, its leaders and its inhabitants, on the northern Indian nations; their customs and hardships, and good insights as to why and how each nation chose where to stand in the conflict. The writing itself is very good; great descriptive passages and settings that come to life. However, the story and characterization only get 3 Stars from me. The first half of the book starts off very promising, but then the main characters become separated for long lengths of time and a few subplots come and go and when they finally get back together it's very anti-climactic and doesn't feel truly satisfying. The point of view switches around so much, (there are about 20 different POVs), it's hard to really get to the meat of any one character, so they all come off being rather superficial. And at times I really just wanted to smack Nicole.My final reaction to this book was really more like 3 Stars, but it is too well-researched and crafted to rate it that low, so I'm giving more weight to the historical content. I do think this author is worthy of another chance and so I plan to read the first book in her series about New York City, City of Dreams: A Novel of Nieuw Amsterdam and Early Manhattan."}, {"userName": "Amy S", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1010492-amy-s", "userReview": "Wow. Never would I have thought I could be so engaged in the French and Indian War. This book spans the years of a family in New York State that finds themselves trying to keep one foot on both sides of the war. I was fascinated finding out about Native American/English settler history. What I really appreciated about this book was the fact it didn't pretty up either side of the war. Both the Native Americans and whites did some pretty atrocious things. Our history seems to have swung like a pendulum from demonizing the Native Americans, to making them the innocent victims and the whites the massacre-ists, and hopefully now it will be acceptable to just tell the truth. I would not have wanted to have been a settler on the edge of the \"border\" so to speak. A rough time. The Native American culture was both beautiful, fascinating and violent and terrifying at the same time. Loved finding out so much about their culture, as well as their relations between tribes. Amazing how their views on honor and death were so different from the whites. Post-edit: I think the novel would have been a little better if he would have dropped some of the tangents and sub-plots. He tried to cover a few too many bases.FYI: Novel contains some pretty graphic, realistic violence and war. The Indians were pretty blunt and nonchalant about sex, so it's pretty much the same way in a few scenes."}, {"userName": "Theresa Leone Davidson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson", "userReview": "Rich in historical detail, this novel follows the lives of sort-of stepbrothers Cormac Shea and Quentin Hale. Quentin is the white boy, raised in privilege on a northern plantation (patent) called Shadowbrook, who at the age of six or seven meets half Native American, half white boy Cormac Shea. Shea's mother, a Native American, mistress to Quentin's father, moves into Shadowbrook with her son, despite the fact that Quentin's mother is still very much alive and not so happily married. This is the backdrop, most of the book is when the two are already grown, during the four years that lead up to the Revolutionary War. The fighting between the French and English, the Natives and the Europeans, the Americans and the English, it is all here, in stunning and very violent detail. I loved the characters, a big plus, and I learned a lot about the time period, to be sure. It was, however, unpleasant to read a lot of the book because of the violence, and because it is always depressing to read about man's capability to act in such inhumane ways. The only reason I picked this one at the library (had never heard of it or of the author) is because there is a former estate called Shadowbrook, now a restaurant/event location, close to where I live in New Jersey, and I had my wedding reception there, so I decided to get the book just because of that, and I'm glad I did. Depressing or not, Swerling is a good writer, and if you like historical fiction, I would definitely recommend this."}, {"userName": "Lacy", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/660952-lacy", "userReview": "Beverly Swerling is fast becoming one of my favorite historical fiction authors, period. I think she's probably safely in second place actually, behind only my somewhat embarrassing obsession with Phillipa Gregory. Shadowbrook only has tenuous connections to the characters introduced in  City of Dreams, but it retains that sort of epic, multi-character perspective that makes her other books so appealing. Very enjoyable, all around."}, {"userName": "Janie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6034043-janie", "userReview": "Beverly Swerling\u2019s novels introduced me to early American history, and Shadowbrook is my favourite of them all. It takes place before the American Revolution during the French and Indian wars. There is plenty of history about a conflict that doesn\u2019t get much attention, a war that was not as glamorous or definitively triumphant as 1776, but still essential to understanding the dynamics of the alliances that formed before the colonies finally went to war with Britain. There\u2019s lots of the competent story-telling I\u2019ve come to expect from Swerling. Other reviewers have summarized the plot, so I\u2019ll just focus on why I liked it. This book is more intimate than Swerling\u2019s other novels; she lets us spend time with the people. The two main characters, Quentin Hale and Cormac Shea, arrive at Shadowbrook, their family plantation and immediately the intrigue begins, complications fed by family dynamics, and deepened by war, love, and avarice. There\u2019s lots to keep the pages turning, but it\u2019s the scenes set in Shadowbrook that stand out for me. I loved the small details of everyday life on the farm, the self-sufficient toughness of its workers and tenants. Shadowbrook, a precarious oasis of safety in a perilous time, brought this era of history alive for me."}, {"userName": "Andrea Seaver ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16089182-andrea-seaver", "userReview": "Truly, I wish that the author had just let the story be a story. Entirely too much like reading a textbook through a layer of characters that had been created only for the purpose of being the vehicle of a history lesson. I wanted to be invested in these characters, they had such promise of depth, however, the author frequently left them two dimensional, and their motives unplumbed so that she could encompass more of the period history than was needed. A reader sitting down with a historical novel will generally have some basic knowledge and interest in the time period in which the novel is set. Therefore, we need less of a teaching moment, and more of an escape. A bringing to life of a period in which we are already interested. The character to character conflict seem the purest melodrama, overblown and manufactured. The romance was just suddenly \"there\" with no build, no time to evolve. I will hesitate to pick up any further works by this author."}, {"userName": "Emmy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4838520-emmy", "userReview": "Lots and lots of history here.

I liked the 3 characters and I wish they were the only ones. To many other characters which made the book feel long and boring. I don't care what little George did that one day when Nicole was in the convent. It would have been a better book for me if it wasn't so historically correct.

The novel follows many different characters but the main protagonist of the book seems to be Quentin Hale. The Good:The book is very, very well researched and the inaccuracies are small enough that only the most pedantic historian would nitpick them. The multiple settings are described beautifully and add nice atmosphere. The battles, too, are well written. Some of the characters have interesting arcs if not entirely engaging ones and many have unique voices. Most are depicted as in a morally gray area as well which I think is important in a book that follows a war.The Bad:Quentin Hale's portion of the story was, unfortunately, really flaccid. As the guy we're supposed to be rooting for he comes of bland most of the time. He's always right about everything and is rarely shown as being challenged morally. He leaves the story almost the exact same as he entered it. Everything he does is painted with a positive brush (there is a particularly slimy thing he does at the end that's shown as romantic, too). A lot of characters meet their end too neatly, once having served their usefulness being killed off in ways that left little impact, if any, and a few in particular made me think the deaths were done simply for the fact that it'd make Quent's happy ending easier. There is also a TON of PoV shifts and they can be hard to keep track of. Not only that but I feel as a good chunk of them added nothing to the story and could have been removed entirely to focus more attention towards other areas of the plot that needed more padding. It's hard to connect with any of the characters because of the constant shifts and small amounts of time we get to spend with each of them. It almost feels like Shadowbrook was supposed to be a trilogy but had to nipped down to one book with smaller 'books' inside. The Ugly: The rape, beating, and torture of a 9 year old Ibo slave girl. It was gratuitous and, most importantly, completely unnecessary to the plot. By that point it was already well established that the character who did this was depraved and an all around bad person. Even if it hadn't been established the amount of detail and pages wasted (page amounts that were rarely granted else where in the narrative I might add) on this one event was appalling. That was time, effort, and energy that could have been spent elsewhere. In conclusion:This novel isn't great but I think has enough redeeming qualities that make it worth a look if you're in to mostly accurate historical novels that are set in a time of war. It'll likely frustrate those who enjoy fleshed out characters. It's not for those who are squeamish."}, {"userName": "Kathy Stone", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5207629-kathy-stone", "userReview": "This book is set during the French and Indian War mainly in upstate New York. There is some mention of the Ohio Country which will become Pittsburg, Pennsylvania later and Quebec in Canada. I am unsure exactly where in Canada they were fighting as there was only the map of the Hale Patent at the beginning of this novel. That would be my main complaint of this story is that it was hard to place the actions. The history portions did not bother me as much as I really like History. I did find the text of this novel I bit dense which was why it took so long to read. It has been a while since a book as taken me nine days to read. While that may not be a bad thing in and of itself I recognize that other readers do not like dense novels burdened with a lot of historical information. There is a short bibliographical essay in the acknowledgments on where Beverly Swerling got some of her information for those wanting to do further research. Unfortunately I currently have too any books to read to start that particular list at the present time. I do not see it happening during this calendar year, either so we will all see where my reading takes me in 2014. Shadowbrook is a land grant patent in New York Colony. It was given to Quentin Hale's Great Grandfather originally. This is set in the eighteenth century when there were still slaves in New York to give fair warning to any reader who may be offended by our country's more reprehensible acts of the past. There is one character at the beginning who mentions emancipation, but that is all. The rest of the story takes the reader around the French and Indian War until the French are defeated in Quebec and forced to flee to Louisiana. There is a lot about Indian rights in this novel and as they were either lied to or had their land stolen from them anyway it is hard to fathom what side Swerling is actually on. She tried to show the Indians in a positive light through her narrative, but reading between the lines one can see why they lost their lands. This is another difficult topic in American History, but one cannot go around terrorizing one's neighbors. The Indians seemed to be at a perpetual state of war even before English colonization. There is a brother rivalry in this novel also that threatens the Patent and that is the main story because Quentin finding a spouse."}, {"userName": "Mighty_k24", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10033907-mighty-k24", "userReview": "In 't kort: het boek speelt zich af tussen 1745 en 1758, in de Verenigde Staten en Quebec. De historische setting focust op de oorlog tussen de Engelsen en Fransen om heerschappij in de Nieuwe Wereld, met de Indianen er tussenin. Daarin volgen we Cormac Shea en Quentin Hale, twee blanke halfbroers die grootgebracht zijn bij de Indianen. Zij zijn zogenaamde 'bridge-persons', mannen die de twee beschavingen met elkaar in verband brengen, en hebben een grote droom waarin de Indianen vreedzaam naast de blanken leven.Daarnaast is er ook nog het verhaal van Nicole Crane, een jonge Franse dame van Engelse afkomst, die als Arme Klare het klooster van Quebec wil intreden.Mijn oordeel: een verhaal over trouw, verraad, liefde, dromen en oorlog. Het verhaal wordt chronologisch verteld, maar vanuit verschillende locaties, en dus elke keer door iemand anders verteld. Zo worden verschillende verhalen door elkaar heen verteld, en dat kan even verwarrend zijn. Omdat ik het boek even had laten liggen, ben ik helemaal opnieuw moeten beginnen. Maar de auteur beloont je voor je inspanningen met een ravissant verhaal, waarbij de historische couleur locale zorgt voor een extra toets bij een al heel knap ineengeknutselde roman. En dat de Indianen achteraf met lege handen achterblijven, dat zal niemand verrassen.Ook nog leuk: je steekt er nog wat van op.

It spins the tale by weaving in the stories of everday people and the bearing the times had on people's lives. When I recall how history was taught in school, it required the tedious memorization of names and dates and included so little about people, relationships, the impact of greater political struggles on everyday life. Great book."}, {"userName": "Jsmith568", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11742483-jsmith568", "userReview": "I don't normally write reviews. After seeing the multiple 4 and 5 star reviews for this book, however, I felt compelled. I struggled mightily to finish this book. I love historical fiction but there is very little story in this book. It reads like a text book. The facts of the French and Indian War take over the story and strip any interest from plot. I read the e-book version of this book and there are many, many typos, Many. A ridiculous number. So many in fact that I wonder if the version published as the e-book was really a draft and not the final edited version."}, {"userName": "Phair", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613975-phair", "userReview": "Did not really like this one- it tried to cover too much. Lots of loves lost and found, lots of rushing back & forth across the territory. Seemed like she included every step of every player in the conflict from 1754 to 1769 and beyond. Overall it felt like watching an inevitable disaster unfold in excruciating detail. Painful. I wanted more personal focus and less history. Very graphic depictions of torture were also a turn-off."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4166614-sue", "userReview": "I would have given the book a much higher rating because I enjoyed the main characters, but I found all of the secondary characters and their cousins stories slow moving. I won't give away any spoilers, but epilogue ending was a bit of a cop out. It had very important info about one of the main characters, which was wrapped up in a few sentences. It would have been far more interesting to have been developed rather than all of the secondary characters."}, {"userName": "Charlene", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/894116-charlene", "userReview": "Shadowbrook had its moments - sections that I really felt connected to the characters and the storyline. But overall, I was a little disappointed with it. I started it in early November and put it down numerous times to read something else. I was determined to finish it; so I kept at it. But I have to admit - I did skim and skip a lot!"}], "description": "A sweeping tale of love, ambition, and a war that ignited a revolution...  1754. In a low-lying glen in Ohio Country, where both the French and English claim dominion, the first musket ball fired signals the start of a savage seven-year conflict destined to dismantle France's overreaching empire and pave the way for the American Revolution. In a world on the brink of astonishing change are Quentin Hale, the fearless gentleman-turned-scout, fighting to preserve his beloved family plantation, Shadowbrook; Cormac Shea, the part-Irish, part-Indian woodsman with a foot in both worlds; and the beautiful Nicole Crane, who, struggling to reconcile her love for Hale and her calling to the convent, becomes a pawn in the British quest for territory. Moving between the longhouses of the Iroquois and Shadowbrook's elegant rooms, the frontier's virgin forests and the cobbled streets of Qu\u00e9bec, Swerling weaves a tale of passion and intrigue, faith and devotion, courage and betrayal. Peopled with a cast of unforgettable characters and historical figures, including a young George Washington, this richly textured novel vividly captures the conflict that opened the eighteenth century and ignited our nation's quest for independence. A classic in the making, Shadowbrook is a page-turning tale of ambition, war, and the transforming power of both love and duty.", "title": "Shadowbrook", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/519764.Shadowbrook", "average": 3.71, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1416788586l/519764.jpg", "reviews": 75, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/162281.Beverly_Swerling", "name": "Beverly Swerling"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Literature", "Historical", "North American Hi..."], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/519764.Shadowbrook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/820947.Shadowbrook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13138867-shadowbrook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/278656.City_of_Dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567129.City_of_Glory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15811504-bristol-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3079074-city-of-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8863735-city-of-promise", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
