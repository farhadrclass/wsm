But from the first chapter, this book did not grab me. And I guess I am the anomaly, given how much people are rhapsodizing about this novel, which is fine, not every book is for every reader. So, if you think you might like this book, please do check it out! For certain, this book is readable in that I read it in a few hours. I kept hoping that the amazingness would suddenly appear to me and all the pieces would fall into place. Alas. Nothing I say here is meant to be disrespectful to the writer. Writing books takes time and effort and this writer has put in the work and so none of this rises out of ill will. I am actually not at all familiar with the writer. I also don\u2019t write on Goodreads for the writer. Writers should not read Goodreads reviews of their own work. Goodreads is for readers and it is as a reader I offer these thoughts. Given how this book is about trauma and violence, I wanted to love it (for lack of a better word). The overall premise is well in my writing AND reading wheelhouse and the kind of story I tend to gravitate to. But\u2026 there was a lot of darkness and grittiness and I didn\u2019t feel especially moved by any of it. It was all so clinically brutal. I should have wanted to cry but I just felt\u2026 not much of anything. I did not believe the violence. And I surely did not believe Turtle as a young woman dealing with such a horrifying circumstance. With respect, it felt like a man guessing at how a young woman in her situation would feel. It was unbelievable and not in a good way.The sexual violence was written, all too often, with an uncomfortable amount of romance which is to say if you forgot who the characters were, you\u2019d think this was just a fucked up love story between two un-related grown folks and not, you know, a horrifying tale of incest. I DO understand what the writer was going for, trying to convey the conflict Turtle felt, the push and pull of a girl who is living in an untenable situation she has no choice in, being drawn to her father and repulsed by his abuse, being human and having physical reactions to things she is resistant to and not actively consenting to. But\u2026 the approach here doesn\u2019t work at all. Though Martin sees his daughter as a lover, there should be\u2026 more clarity that Turtle, however conflicted and fraught she finds the situation, does not see herself as her father\u2019s lover. I\u2019m not articulating my thought well here. There\u2019s just a way to go about this and I did not like the way it was handled here.I wanted more interiority from Turtle. The third person narration was a curious choice and I felt so much distance from Turtle and not in a way that felt organic to what I see as the novel\u2019s ambitions. And Turtle SHOULD be the kind of narrator that becomes canon\u2014tough, interesting, smart, fucked up. But because we don\u2019t have the interiority she deserves, the potential of her character is never realized. Several scenes were displays of unbridled sadism and again, I get why, and I am not judging the content. Lord knows, I am not afraid of violence in fiction. I simply question the lack of genuine purpose for that content. The excess of description was really off putting. Like, we get it\u2014it\u2019s water, it\u2019s the woods, it\u2019s a sparsely decorated house. Calm! Down! With! The! Adjectives! And I am fine with descriptive writing but more often than not the prose offered an excess of description that really compromised the pacing. And despite all the description, it was challenging to get a real sense of place. I just started to dread turning the page for fear there would be more description, more \u201clook what I can do with words!\u201d which is not\u2026 ideal. And just\u2026 so much of the description did not make sense. It was just word soup.There is a baffling moment where Turtle\u2019s pussy is described as, \u201ctrim and compact as an anemone bunkered down\" but in the most bizarre way. WHY IS THIS HERE? Also, every time the word \u201cpussy\u201d appears it just\u2026 it\u2019s weird. And then toward the end, Tallent switches it to cunt. But it\u2019s just as jarring. And when we first meet Turtle she is \u201ccoltish\u201d and also her hips are \u201cwide but slender.\u201d Like\u2026 dude, pick one. And of course, you know the next line is going to be that she is beautiful but in a surprising way right? Sure enough, she is described as \u201can ugly face she knows, but an unusual one.\u201d Sigh. Of course.Here is the whole description:\"She is tall for fourteen, coltishly built, with long legs and arms, wide but slender hips and shoulders, her neck long and corded. Her eyes are her most striking feature, blue, almond-shaped in a face that is too lean, with wide, sharp cheekbones, and her crooked, toothy mouth\u2014an ugly face, she knows, and an unusual one.\"The description makes her sound like a Star Trek alien.She gets her period and just dips her fingers in her pussy to feel her \u201cmenarche\u201d and then gives it a lil taste and fine, maybe this would happen, but\u2026 sigh. Why? And like, these are the things that kept jumping out, not like the actually important stuff. The obsession with guns was disproportionate to the role of guns in the overall narrative. There were guns everywhere all the time, just out in the open. I live in an an open carry state and I was still like\u2026 what is happening???? And several times, I thought, if Turtle cleans that gun one more time, I\u2019m going to flip my coffee table.There were so many plot threads that felt abandoned and incomplete. All that energy spent on description might have been better spent on character development and backstory. We know Martin is a sadistic nutcase but that\u2019s it. He says he hates his father but his father comes across as a reasonably decent guy. How does he make money? How does he own such valuable land? What really happened to Turtle\u2019s mother? How on EARTH has he not lost custody of Turtle yet? This one character, Brett\u2019s mother shows up, and turns out, she was best friends with Turtle\u2019s mom, and nothing comes of this. Like, she stops by the house once and that\u2019s that. WHY SWAY? The teenagers were so very precocious and hyper verbal and mostly free to roam the world with few discernible problems. It was like Dawson\u2019s Creek but in Mendocino. The one part that works is the epilogue, of sorts, where we see Turtle in the after of everything that transpires. This part is, of course, like only ten pages. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s me, I guess, not the book."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "[Martin brings home another girl (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jennifer Masterson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28953843-jennifer-masterson", "userReview": "Bam! All the freaking stars!!! Why do we read? I'm serious? Why? Because books like these exist! \"My Absolute Darling\" in my humble opinion is a modern masterpiece! An absolute, all consuming, beautifully written work of art! I loved it so much!I'm completely exhausted. This book was all consuming. I wanted to save Turtle from her monster father all throughout this book. I wanted her to run and get help when she could have. Most of this novel is dark and disturbing but there are glimmers of joy, especially when Turtle is with Jacob. The writing is some of the finest I've ever come across in modern literature, and I dare say it actually got me out of the book rut I was in. There will be much debate about this book to come. Some will absolutely love this novel and others will be absolutely disgusted by the scenes that have graphic abuse of a minor and the language Gabriel Tallent uses to convey them. I do feel these scenes were appropriate because they show the depravity of Turtle's father, Martin. I want to put this out there, if this is a made into a movie I think Michael Shannon should play Martin. I think he would be perfect.I listened to the audio version. The beginning is shaky because the narrator has a husky voice but within the first hour she had me hooked and did a great job with all of the characters voices. Highly recommended for literary fiction fans with an err on the side of caution for people with triggers."}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "Warning: extreme and disturbing material!This is a psychologically chilling, dark and disturbing novel set in remote Mendocino, California, charting the dysfunctional, an understatement, relationship between 14 year old Turtle (Julia) and her end of the world believer, armed to the teeth, survivalist father, Martin, who has stockpiled dried food that will last 3 years. This book has echoes of Helena and Jacob Holbrook's relationship in The Marsh King's Daughter by Karen Dionne, although in comparison to this, that is a picnic in the park. Turtle is a wild child, a daddy's girl, and never happier than when roaming the wild coastal landscape. She is a silent child, lacking friends, and treats with contempt other girls and women, echoing the heartfelt misogyny of her ever loving father. Every morning she wakes up, slings a can of beer to Martin and cracks eggs into her mouth, prior to leaving for school, where she is visibly struggling. Martin is Turtle's world, she is kibble, his absolute darling, his reason for living. Turtle's entire identity is predicated upon Martin's perceptions and attitudes, she knows no other world. This is an intimate character study with a narrative related from Turtle's perspective.Martin is a pathologically sick, brutal and sadistic father, prone to terrorising and belittling Turtle, and sexually abusing her. He is clever, volatile, manipulative, emotionally damaged and obsessed with absolute control over his daughter. Turtle is his possession, anyone that challenges that is in grave danger, none more so than Turtle herself. She routinely practices her shooting with her various guns and commits to the daily cleaning of her guns. However, chinks begin to appear in Turtle's armour as she begins to become aware that others live different lives, with more integrity and decency, and that it is possible for her to have the potential to make friends and relationships that challenge the way she and her father live. Turtle has a primal need for a separate identity from her father, one that has her taking risks as she reaches for alternative choices but one which drives Martin wild with fear, hatred and cruelty. Turtle finds her intentions undone when she meets and befriends Jacob and Brett, mesmerised by their literary and philosophical banter, and taken aback by their respect, attention, and the high value they place on her. Anna, her teacher, eventually manages to connect with Turtle sufficiently for Turtle to break the block preventing her from educationally moving on, as she demonstrates her personal understanding of exacerbate and recalcitrant . Brett and Jacob's family connect with and come to care for Turtle. However, these developments bring their stresses, strains and challenges for Turtle. Her unsettled psyche is still caught up with her unconditional love for Martin, which makes moving on excruciatingly painful. Martin punishes Turtle brutally for her infractions and threatens her friends. Full of shame, self hatred, yet determined to keep her friends safe, Turtle makes a devil's bargain to sacrifice herself for her friends and for her father. A bargain that Turtle will break, not for her own safety and sanity but for another, after which all hell breaks loose.This is a viscerally atmospheric and compelling novel from Gabriel Tallent, taking on the desperately disturbing territory of Martin and Turtle's relationship, a veritable terrifying can of worms. The prose is vital and vibrant, with exquisite descriptions of the wild flora and fauna of the coast. The characters are nuanced and complex, Martin is charming, and with enough self awareness to see the monster that he has become, yet he just does not have the capacity to act on this for change. The trigger for change lies in his beloved kibble, Turtle, but Martin is not going to give up without the fight of his life. It is not easy for Turtle to do the right thing and break the only world she knows, this psychological portrayal feels authentic, change comes gradually, until Turtle reaches the point where she must act, whatever the outcome. This is a raw, intelligent and moving novel that I will not forget. It is undoubtedly a challenging read that I highly recommend. Many thanks to HarperCollins 4th Estate for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "The setting of this story is what first interested me in this novel....having grown up in the San Francisco bay area.The Northern California coast - Mendocino- is one of the natural wonders in the world. It's surrounded by secluded cliff side beaches, bird-rich estuaries, rivers, hiking trails, canyons, waterfalls, giant redwoods, the famous Pygmy Forests of pine and cypress, and it's an unincorporated community. In the late 60's and 70's, Mendocino became the counter culture Community for intentional living with principles such as nonviolence and respect. Communes were popping up like poppies. Berries grew in abundance because the ground was so acid. Today - Mendocino, is not only a picturesque place - but it's become an affluent community - a tourist get-a-way spot--a leap from the hippie days when rural poverty- unemployment- starving artist- plumbing problems - roofing and electrical problems - were more common living conditions. At the start of \"My Absolute Darling\", it's clear by the descriptions--that Author Gabriel Tallent wasn't painting us a rosy picture of Turtle's home life --no matter how gorgeous the beach was. The old house up on the hill\u2026with peeling white paint, boarded windows, an unfinished back deck, grainy redwood kitchen counters, and *Turtle*, 14 years old, has been sleeping on a plywood bed, with an army surplus bag pulled over her since she was 6 years old. She goes to sleep at night listening to rats eating off the dirty dishes in the kitchen. She wakes up in the mornings- going into that kitchen - getting a can of beer to toss to her dad grabs eggs for herself that she cracks right into her mouth. Shabby physical conditions was the least of Turtle's problems. Grandpa Daniel knew it was no way for his son, Martin, to raise a girl, and was definitely more than concerned - and at 'first' not aware of 'how' bad things were --but by the time he did discover 'bruises' on Turtle's body, it was too late to make permanent influential power.....but not for the lack of trying. Martin did whatever he damned pleased. MARTIN WAS NOT A WELL MAN BY ANY STANDARDS WHAT-SO-EVER!!! Here is a sample - mild - normal- type dialogue between Martin and Turtle ---[this scene takes place after Martin discovers Grandpa gave Turtle, his \"Kibble\", a knife]....The reader knows Martin feels jealous and threatened- because Martin 'must' be #1 in her life. Martin owns her - he 'demands' she love only him....( in the way a psychopath sadistic manipulative abusive father would do).... but Martin knows Turtle is upset with him for grabbing the knife away from her and breaking it... and DADDY WANTS TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR HIS DARLING. \"Forget it, Turtle says. It doesn't matter.  \"It does matter. You're mad about it, my love. I'll make it good. \"No, I don't care', she says  \"Kibble, he says, give me the knife, I'm not going to have you pissed at me because that knife is as fragile as a fucking toy. I made a mistake, and I can set that knife up just like you want it, good as new\". \"Something you have to care for\".  \"Well, that's funny, because, Martin says, I thought a knife was supposed to care of you. I thought that was the point\". As I was reading throughout this story --there are so many situations where we see how the 'daddy' manipulates Turtle's thoughts - and is so clever at it. What Martin did next with the knife boggled my mind. He turned Turtle's thinking around- ( while still controlling and abusive) - to where she surrendered inward -- in the same way a turtle retreats it's head into its shell. My god, we see -- and understand - but wish we could change things --( like Turtle's teacher Anna so wanted to do)--how kids who come from families with an abusive parent - physically - emotionally - sexually- and spiritually....STILL LOVE THEM and want to protect the parent who is NOT PROTECTING them. Yes, Turtle hated him on some level too -but most of her life - she just hated herself. The author did give us a very raw and real picture --almost a formula - of what happens with children who are raised day in and day out with the type of father Martin was to her I kept thinking - Turtle is 14... rebellious years... isn't she going to fight back - discover her strong inner identity separate from her father? Where is her voice? Her sense of self worth? And then I read this ---  \"I need that hardness in you. I need you to be hard on me, because I am no good for myself, and you make me do what I want to do but cannot do for myself; but still \u2013 \u2013 you are sometimes not careful; there is something in you, something less than careful, something almost \u2013 \u2013 I don't know, I am not sure, but I know it's there.\"Geeeee....OMG..... I've been typing faster than the speed of light and I just realize this is not a short abbreviated review. I hope my bones forgive me---but without being a part of a book discussion--this is the type of book where my mind has thoughts all over the place. In fact --there were many times when I was reading this novel, I was sitting on the spin bike we have here at the house, and I started reading out loud instead of to myself---because as disturbing as this book is there are some of the most gorgeous sentences.... and when I would read them out loud ..... thank goodness nobody was home because it would've been a little bit embarrassing....but the visuals of Turtle walking barefoot for miles ( shoes?- oh my!), through the huckleberries and the Rhododendrum's ---were lovely -- but then Turtle - our wild nature girl would have me shaking my head...... and once again I would be aware of the authors writing. I was sizzling with mixtures of emotions often - often - often!!! Here's another small excerpt where I have ying/yang thoughts: \"The morning turns to early afternoon, blue cottony, flat-bottomed clouds towing shadows across the forested slopes. A barren clay promontory, the road makes a turn and descends into the eastern most of two gulches, and here a clay pullout overlooks the valley. Long dried ruts. An old VW bus with its tires riding to the ground, ceanothus growing up against the driver's-side quarter panel\". Turtle slits rabbits, and scoops their guts with ease in the same way other teenagers might bake cookies. She uses a gun and a knife with the same ease that other young teenage girls do a cell phone. Her survival skills were very impressive when she first meets Brett and Jacob out in the forest --Brett with a can of EASY CHEESE. The boys lost in the redwoods..... and it started raining and lightning and if it wasn't for Turtle's help -they would have suffered much more .... They considered her a Ninja! Things become much more complicated and intense - once Turtle becomes friends with the boys. Plus, Anna, Turtle's teacher is starting to prove herself trustworthy in Turtle's eyes, too -- but Turtle's mind is split .... loyalty to her dad or not ...We know how her dad feels....  Martin says: \"How big you're getting. How strong. My absolute darling my absolute darling\".\"Yes\". she says.\"Just mine?\" \"Just yours\", she says, and he crashes the side of his face against her hips, looks up at her, his arms encircled the small of her back. \"You promise?\" he says\"I promise\", she says \"No one else's?\"\"No one else's, she says. JUST WAIT.... THINGS COME UNDONE! -Like it or hate it - absolutely disturbing- this won't be a novel a reader will forget. Turtle --( her real name is Julie) --is a very interesting character. Even the 'name' chosen could not have been a pick of a straw.When it comes to animal symbolism, the turtle is a great example of persistence, determination, endurance, and the turtle is a survivor. NOTE: The sexual abuse narrative is the most graphic - ghastly and atrocious that I've ever come across in any fiction novel.....the kind that leaves you with a pit in your belly--readers must be warned.....but I felt it was worth reading because looking at human behavior--the horrifying sides of life --that take place in a person's home - teaches us compassion at a whole deeper level. That annoying spirited person who bugs the heck out of us?.....maybe we have no idea at all what they grew up with."}, {"userName": "Rebbie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6582211-rebbie", "userReview": "There are people who are falsely claiming that those of us who are giving this book a high rating are doing so because we love that it is sordid, incestuous, exploitative, etc. These false accusations are offensive and say more about the individual and their low view of women than it does about anyone else.Here's the truth: If anything, the book is getting high ratings  despite its disturbing content. For proof of this, read any number of the excellent reviews for this book.Also, it's been said that \"real victims\" don't act the way Turtle does. This is also deeply offensive.  There IS NO set standard for a victim's reaction, especially while abuse is presently happening. One size does not fit all. The one thing that truly bothers me is hard to quantify here, but it has to do with the way it's written. It almost feels as if there's a deliberate attempt to stir adrenaline in the reader or even to reap enjoyment from reading about the graphic sexual abuse. I've seen this in some horror movies as well, where the creator appears to want the viewer to enjoy what they're seeing...If I had to guess I'd say that this is the root cause of why so many of us feel uncomfortable, unsettled, or downright disturbed with this book. It isn't the story line per se, but the way that it's presented to the reader."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-jen", "userReview": "My Absolute Darling is absolutely disturbing. And dark. And depressing. Turtle is 14 years old and is being abused by her father - physically, sexually and emotionally. He is an extreme renegade survivalist and has isolated Turtle from friends, from people.They live in a remote part of California along the coast where she often escapes in order to breathe and sort out the emotional mess and confusion she is gripped with. During one of these escapes, she makes a friend. A boy who is a little older than her and she is forced to confront the lies she has been living with.Did I like this? I'm not a sadist. But it was gripping, intense and evoked such a visceral repsonse from disgust, to hate, to hope. I think this author has talent, but not sure he needs to spin a tail in such detail to capture our attention.This is one is tough to rate. It was gripping but if you aren't comfortable with being uncomfortable, this is definitely a novel to stay away from.Would I recommend it? Hmmm.

Very dark and disturbing, but one of the most noteworthy novels I have read this year!Despite some very stellar reviews, I waffled back and forth, unable to decide if really wanted to tackle this one, but thanks to my GR friend, Jennifer Masterson\u2019s review, I took the plunge. I knew going in this story was controversial and perhaps not for everyone. Yet, I still was not emotionally prepared for the intensity of the novel and the almost unbearable passages I had to endure. It is one of those stories I had to read in small doses, but one I couldn\u2019t put down for too long. For those who have read \u2018The Marsh King\u2019s Daughter\u2019 you can\u2019t help but notice some similarities and maybe to some extent, \u2018The Seven Lives of Samuel Hawley\u2019, but while each of those novels were remarkable in their own right, this novel takes those concepts into an entirely new realm. On the surface, Turtle\u2019s upbringing may seem merely unorthodox, to some. She attends school, but often runs wild. Her father, a hardcore survivalist, is inconsistent about his daughter's education, but is absolutely rigid about the lessons in survival he tutors her in. But, if anyone is looking close enough, they will see much more going on. Once the reader is allowed to witness the training Turtle's father puts such a premium on, the sense of dread doesn\u2019t slowly creep up on you, it hits you right between the eyes. It's immediate, violent, extreme, and relentless. But, while Turtle is aware enough on some level that she is different from the other students in school, and she dutifully covers up her bizarre upbringing.\u2018Turtle wonders if there are things that she is blind to that other people see, and what those things might be.\u2019She accepts the confines of her life, copes with her father as best she can, convinced he loves her, until she meets Jacob, purely by chance. The development of this friendship, opens up an entirely new world for Turtle, allowing her a glimpse inside a more normal atmosphere, which makes her yearn for something different, something more, something better for herself. Against insurmountable odds, Turtle fights not only a physically bruising battle, but an internal battle against many psychological angles. It\u2019s exhausting, but her resilience is awe inspiring. \u2018Her moments of happiness occur right at the margin of unbearable. She knows it will not last and she thinks, you can never forget, Turtle, what is like, here, without him. You have to hold tight on to it, how good it is.\u2019This writing is raw, uncompromising and stark, with a minimalistic approach to dialogue, and what dialogue there is, is often filled to capacity with harsh language. The author defers to or relies on descriptive scenery, or scenes of action, allowing peaceful, but heavy silences to dwell in places, as we catch our breaths. Turtle has a long road ahead, her isolation and severe abuse stunting her ability to articulate her emotions in a more profound manner. Turtle struggles mightily with the truth, her inner turmoil nearly as painful as the many other abuses she endures. \u2018Nothing is as difficult as sustained and unremitting contact with your own mind.\u2019But, the underlying and overriding themes and ultimate relief, albeit not perfect, with some demons left to fight and work to be done, is still worth every ounce of agonizing pain I suffered. *Be aware this book could prompt triggers for some readers.Pulling out all the stars for this one- 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Mary Beth *Traveling Sister*", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14233569-mary-beth-traveling-sister", "userReview": "Just got back from a Florida vacation!4.5 stars!!Turtle Alveston is a survivor. She has grown up isolated since the death of her mother, and is raised by her charismatic father Martin, who is an awful man who tortures her. She is fourteen years old. She is raised with lots of guns. They are all hooked on wall pegs in her room. She has a Lewis Machine & Tool AR-10, a Noveske AR-15 and a Remington 870 twelve gauge pump-action shotgun. Her favorite gun is her AR-10. It is so heavy. Every night she dissembles the gun and cleans it with a brass bristled brush and with cotton patches. Turtle loves the forest, and roams all over it. She knows her way and meets a friend named Jacob, in the forest. She is known to go thirty miles across country in a single day. Her Dad says she is part wild cat, you can't wear her out. When she was just a little thing, she would walk all the way to the Little River Market, in her diapers and bare feet. Turtles eyes are cold blue eyes, full of murder and vitriol.Her mother said that it was a mountain lion that got her that way. She says that she was asleep in her bedroom and Martin left the mudroom door open and when Turtle woke up a mountain lion was in bed with her. Turtle doesn't like to go to school. Her teacher asks her why she isn't at school and Turtle raises her hands in helplessness and let's them drop. She says \" I have tried and tried and I fail, and that's all that I ever do.\" When she does go to school, she just sits there and stares out the window and never studies. She isolates herself from the other students and struggles with social skills. Turtle didn't believe in herself, she never tried because she was afraid that she would fail. Once she started trying she got good grades. Martin's Dad was just as bad as he was. He was very sadistic. He was gentle with Turtle. When Turtle meets Jacob, things change for her. He looks at Turtle as if she is the sunrise. They both have a teenage crush with each other. Her life with Martin, her dad, is not safe and he wants Turtle all to himself. Turtle then starts imagining her escape from Martin.  My thoughtsI just loved this book!!! I do not know why I loved it so much. This is another terrible father and daughter relationship. There have been lots of books about this kind of relationship this year. I have read three of them so far and this is the most darkest and disturbing out of all of then. It is very similar to The Marsh King's Daughter. Both daughters loved and adored their fathers, but this one is extremely dark and disturbing comparing the two. I think a lot of people will love this book and others will hate it. I would start out reading the first chapter and after reading it, if you can get passed that chapter, you will be able to read this book. I think many people will not be able to get passed the first chapter, and believe me if you can't pass that chapter, I can deeply understand because it was almost too much for me. The rest of the book gets better, at least that is my honest opinion but it is a very graphic book. I did like the writing style and thought it was beautifully written but I thought that the foul language ruined it, a little. I don't mind foul language but this was a little over the top. I took a 1/2 star off because of it, and that's the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. I thought the characters were done very well. I loved Turtle and my heart just went out for her. If you loved The Marsh King's daughter and you feel you want to go a lot more darker, then I highly recommend it. You have been warned, and hope you can take the plunge, many others won't be able too, and I can deeply understand if you can't."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "It can't be anything but the full five stars.It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that this book might just have ruined the word 'darling' for me. Each time I see it written or hear it spoken, I get that kick in the stomach, the tightening at the back of your throat, the slight tensing of the body you get when you remember something awful. You want desperately to turn away. I have rarely been so overwhelmed with the sheer physicality of my response to a book. I am sickened. I am living someone else's reality. And it is not where I want to be, but I can't look away.At the same time, it is beautiful. The descriptive power Tallent employs emphasises both the wonder of the natural world and the savage brutality experienced by Turtle. But it's no easy dichotomy at work here, she is lost within the abusive world she inhabits, loving and hating her father in equal measure. It demands you consider how it must feel from inside the circle, the physical and sexual assault so clear to us as readers is her normality. It takes more than just someone promising her a better existence before she can see the possibilities her life just might hold. It's so painful to watch her push herself towards this understanding and with every setback you're as angry at her as you are hurt for her. Focusing on the murky nature of human emotion and behaviour, this book beings life to technicolour reality; clarity is the easy answer in fiction and this aims so much higher than that.An outstanding and daring debut, a literary masterpiece, and a piece of emotive fiction that'll be very hard to forget.

This book is about physical, emotional and sexual abuse of a fourteen-year-old girl by her father. It's not an easy read and many will be turned off by it. Hell, we all should be turned off by it!Turtle Alveston is a fourteen-year-old girl living with her survivalist father in Northern California (her Mother is Dead). She knows the land and has no problem going out into the forest exploring on her own and is quite handy with a gun. She can survive off the land, but can she survive within her father's home? A home in which each morning, before leaving for school, she throws her father a beer and let\u2019s not forget in the beginning of the book we learn he puts their dishes out to be licked clean by raccoons before running a little water on them to be used again. At school Turtle is isolated and withdrawn. She is quiet and lacks friends. She struggles with her studies and although she will be passed on to high school it is evident that she is far behind her peers. Turtle has low self-esteem and self-loathing. Martin, her father, is a rough man. He refers to Turtle as his \"absolute darling\" and is systematically physically, emotionally and sexually abusive to her. \" Goddamn Turtle, Goddamn\u201d He is a man of great depravity and it is alarming that no one seems to suspect anything wrong is going on in that house.As Turtle ventures out into the world, she is introduced to many people and begins to see a very different type of life far opposite than the life she has with her misogynist controlling abusive father. With hopes of a better life, will she have the strength and courage to break free and finally be able to live her own life?One complaint about this book is that some of the scenes to me feels as if they were put in there for the shock value. Abuse in all forms is graphic, shocking and horrific but some of the scenes in the book felt, I don't quite know how to put my finger on it, but something about how it was presented felt off. Books such as \"The Roanoke Girls\" or \"The Marsh King's Daughter\" came to mind while reading this book. I feel that those two books were able to pull off what this book could not - a more believable viewpoint on survival-ism (The Marsh King's Daughter) and sick twisted relationships with molestation (The Roanoke girls)No matter what you think of this book, it has people talking, and I believe that was the Author's intention. When a book causes you to think of other books while reading it; well that can be a good thing or a bad thing. In this case, I thought of books that handled the subject matter better.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Bill Kupersmith", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12460952-bill-kupersmith", "userReview": "How did I manage to order a copy of the English edition of this loathsome piece of drivel? It\u2019s a virtual copy of the American version. But it had a different dust jacket. That mattered. As I bathed in the stream of raw sewage that constitutes \u201cdialog\u201d I kept thinking back on Claire Fuller\u2019s Our Endless Numbered Days, which also features abusive father-daughter incest (now, that phrase is a pleonasm!) in the wilds, but is so much subtler and nuanced that for me it epitomized that difference between English and American literature & culture that accounts for my general aversion to contemporary American fiction by male authors. (Among women writers, we have some equal to the best, such as Megan Abbott.) So imagine my perplexity to find on the back a blurb by Claire Fuller herself: \u201cBrilliantly urgent, brutal and uncompromising. Like a witness to a terrible car crash, I couldn\u2019t draw my eyes away.\u201d Well, I agree with \u201cbrutal\u201d tho\u2019 I\u2019ve no notion what \u201curgent\u201d means here. After I read Our Endless Numbered Days, I sent her a comment expressing a desire for a sequel. But I hope she doesn\u2019t have Peggy borrow Turtle\u2019s vocabulary: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to traction my fucking motherfucking goddamn fingers,\u201d she says when she breaks three fingers (later they seem to heal with remarkable speed. Her murderous father\u2019s gun misfires and she thinks: \u201cYou motherfucker . . . you incompetent fuck. Probably he\u2019d done a shitty job of retooling the gun for full auto and it\u2019s jamming. . .\u201d Later: \u201cno, fuck that\u2014you had your chance, you cunt, and you\u2019re in it now. . . . Hold tight to the world and do not let this go and do not fuck this up.\u201d That last phrase seems to be Turtle\u2019s most admirable characteristic and were it possible to express noble ideas in the language of a fiend from the pit of hell possessing a fourteen year old girl, we\u2019d have the author\u2019s message, perhaps. I was less surprised to find another blurb from an English author I\u2019d read: \u201cA gut-wrenching, terrifying novel written so beautifully it sings off the page. Unlike anything I\u2019ve read before.\u201d That\u2019s Kate Hamer, author of The Girl in the Red Coat, whose character Gramps is the most evil and disgusting I\u2019d encountered in recent fiction (including the Gardener in The Butterfly Garden) till I met Turtle\u2019s father Martin. Wasn\u2019t surprised, because from her portrayal of America in Red Coat, I imagine Kate Hamer thinks that most of us Yanks are just like Martin, fondling our guns and expressing our affection for our offspring like this: \u201cHe drops to one knee and takes her into his arms. \u2018Christ,\u2019 he says, \u2018Christ, Jesus Christ, kibble. Be careful. Christ, kibble. Christ.\u2019 He drops her and she stands there, her waist encircled by his embrace. \u2018How big you\u2019re getting,\u2019 he says, \u2018how strong. My absolute darling. My absolute darling.\u2019\u201d He manages to enunciate the messianic title of the Son of God five times in succession, tho\u2019 utterly devoid of any meaning. None of their \u201cfoul oaths\u201d (as they would have been termed in the 18th century (in a Guardian interview Tallent says he\u2019s read Pamela) mean anything. While the daughter oft refers to Martin as a \u201cmotherfucker,\u201d surely \u201cdaughterfucker\u201d would have been more appropriate. Strangely, Martin is also an intellectual autodidact, fond of reading David Hume (maybe 18th-century moralists were right about immoral nature of Hume\u2019s philosophy), using chick-lit expressions such as \u201chave this conversation\u201d and capable of telling his daughter, \u201cThe truth of you, if it is there at all, exists beyond an unbridgeable and irreducible epistemological gap.\u201d When I read that, I was about ready to enunciate an F-bomb myself. The other salient feature of this novel is Tallent\u2019s excessive fixation on firearms, far beyond the needs of the plot. Turtle (her real name\u2019s Julia and the reptilian alias is never explained) carries a 9mm Sig Sauer as well as her grandfather\u2019s Bowie knife (how on earth she manages to sneak them into school, where the presence of a water pistol would lead to suspension and a major incident?) which she obsessively cleans even when she hasn\u2019t been firing it, which makes no sense. The denouement depends on Martin\u2019s having a dirty weapon, which I also cannot imagine. But then I couldn\u2019t imagine either why Anna, Turtle\u2019s former teacher who is concerned about her never called child protective services, which as a mandatory reporter she would have been required by law to do. Nor, for that matter, why Turtle couldn\u2019t have saved Jacob and the other students at the dance after party from the maniacal Martin simply by calling the sheriff. The accounts of Turtle\u2019s shooting a .357 Magnum revolver at a roadside sign from a moving truck and a coin from between a ten-year old girl\u2019s fingers with a Colt .45 M1911 (surely an M1911A1 BTW) were equally unlikely. Neither is a weapon that a 14 year old would be handy with - recoil is terrific). What could have all the editors, agents, teachers, Guardian reviewers, and contemporary novelists have thought they were recommending? I haven\u2019t a clue. But I suspect that My Absolute Darling is another indication of the complete moral and spiritual vacuum that we call Postmodernism. The lush overblown natural descriptions of the Northern California coast give readers of \u201cliterary fiction\u201d the opportunity to pretend that they are reading \u201cserious fiction\u201d while they inwardly can enjoy the comic-book action of a pistol-packin\u2019 kick-ass teen.

Why ever would I have decided to pick up this piece of garbage? Truth be told, I saw so many four and five star reviews that I think I probably read a different book from the rest of them. Yes, I could have cast it aside and believe me I sure wanted to. However, with so many glowing reviews, I figured just one more chapter, another fifty pages and I would come to a point where this \"masterpiece\" would find its way into my brain. Well, that never happened and now I get to add this to my files as a book that never should have been written (in my opinion).Turtle, the fourteen year old daughter of an abusive sicko father, has been abused sexually, physically, and emotionally. She has been brought up to be a survivalist, foul mouthed girl, friendless, doing poorly in school, and alone. She has herself to rely upon plus some \"love\" from her father who calls her his absolute darling. She meets two boys who befriend her. The boys seem as if they are trying out for a sitcom with their banter and their philosophical loquaciousness. They know something is wrong but hey they don't want to tread on Turtle's space and leave her to the whatever it is they sense is wrong. Turtle attends school where the teacher Anna (yes, they call the teacher by their first names ...so very progressive) recognizes the signs in Turtle that the words \"child abuse\" could be written across her forehead. The teacher does nothing. Where the heck was CPS? I don't care what you kinda sorta thought, if you as an educator suspected anything CPS should be notified. In point of fact, if you as an educator fail to do so, you would be liable. Oh well we all make mistakes right?So let's move on from there with Daddy dearest. He so loved his child we keep on reading. He is such a well read man, reading Descartes being his own person and screwing the establishment and really screwing anything and anybody including the young girl he picks up on a \"find yourself\" hiatus from Turtle. He is vile, but he is able to portray his virility and strength and wow can he shoot a gun! He has turned Turtle into a girl who can take care of herself. What an accomplished father correct? They live in a rat infested piece of garbage house off the beaten track of course and commune with nature. They carry around an array of guns and knives and their morning routine includes Turtle tossing her father a can of beer and she downing a few raw eggs and eating on one occasion as she is tutoring her father's pick up girl, scorpions. Yep, they are tough and mean, and able to take anything. Well, then enough with the salient points of this novel! In a word I found this book to be disgusting. I am well aware of the perverted nature of some adults who consider their children chattel to do with as they will but I felt this book went beyond that and in a sense seem to glorify the very nature of the depravity that some bear within them. There was the typical excuse of \"oh my daddy beat me\" as the kind of go to remark one makes when defending their bad behaviors. Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend this book. Sorry, but the aside to how descriptive this author writes to be is just a cover for a book that obviously thinks itself so current and so in your face. OK then rant over and thank god so is my reading of this book. Apologies also to those who found something in this book.

I see the graphic depictions of child abuse--physical and sexual-- as exploitative, part of a wider trend of the sexualization of children in our culture. People aren't raving over this book because of the fine nature writing--they are attracted to the darkness, the sordid details, and the taboo.I would add: examine why you like this. What contribution is it really making to the world? What is the great statement here? Could it have been achieved by other means?In response to an earlier observation I made on this site-- that the central child character\u2019s reaction to her abuse (i.e.,wanting to be raped and responding with gun violence)--was not representative of an abuse/assault victim, another Goodreads member sought to take me in hand by (flippantly and dismissively, I believe) pointing out that an author is under no obligation to create books and characters that are \u201cposter children for victims of sexual violence\u201d. It should be made clear that I was not asking for political correctness. Obviously, authors can do whatever they damn well please. However, I as a reader also have rights: including the right to object. With regards to sexual and physical violence, I believe that authors do have some moral, human, obligation to depict a victim, particularly a child victim, with sensitivity and psychological realism, not perpetuate should-have-died myths or titillate their audience with graphic details, language that romanticizes incest, or exclamations about love. Turtle, the central character in this piece (and her responses) is/are dwarfed by the graphic, sensational, and frankly gratuitous details of the physical, sexual and emotional violence done to her. To me, the descriptions are exploitative. They read like violent male sexual fantasies\u2014descriptions of snuff film scenes. At one point, Turtle painfully and horrifically dangles from ceiling beams while her father holds a knife to her crotch area, ready to impale her should she drop\u2014perhaps the most violent penetration image in the book, but then again, perhaps not. Even a lovable, loyal elderly dog\u2019s evisceration is described in shameful and horrifying detail.Wrap these horrors up in what some call \u201clush\u201d descriptions of the northern Californian landscape, lots of literary and philosophy allusions, and we are supposed to believe this is an American masterpiece. American, it is. Masterpiece, it is not. I don't care what Stephen King says about it.I am not interested in having intellectual debates with other readers about how the story might have changed had Turtle been given a credible inner life and response to her terrible violation. You can't convince me that the author\u2019s choices were necessary ones or served some higher, artistic goal. I also don't happen to believe that being male disqualifies one from apprehending and sensitively and credibly depicting a female\u2019s response to abuse or sexual assault. However, it is perfectly clear to me that Gabriel Tallent was in no way up to the task. While his bank account may not be suffering for it, his book does. My Absolute Darling is an opportunistic, sensational, manipulative piece. It is not great art. It is not art at all."}, {"userName": "Emer ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4629647-emer", "userReview": "I often think a three star review is the hardest to write. For me it's a positive rating and should be viewed as a recommendation to read if the subject matter or author interests you and that's firmly the recommendation that I give to 'My Absolute Darling'. Gabriel Tallent is a wonderful writer. There is absolutely no denying that. However, for me personally this book was too much. I don't think I am the right reader. The novel follows the story of young Turtle Alveston and her abusive upbringing by her father. And it absolutely destroyed me in places. The descriptions of what Turtle endured (psychological, physical and sexual abuse) were so visceral. Reading this was like a sucker punch to my gut. But I think the most crippling part of this read for me was reading about Turtle's attitude to herself. Her inner voice was so harsh. So crass. Callous...Her self-loathing was soul destroying for me as a reader to read about. I got so frustrated at times just wishing that she could see that she was a victim. Wishing that she could realise that her life was not what life should be. And I know that this frustration was because of the magnificent way the story was written but I could not reconcile myself to that. I found the language too severe rather than emotive. It simply was not to my personal taste but if you are a reader that can separate your personal feelings from such severity of word then there is much to savour in the prose. Turtle's world is a supremely isolated one. There are very few moments of true connections when she interacts with other characters in the novel. However two teenage boys from the local high school do somehow manage to break down her walls for a moment or two and it is these precious moments that make this novel sing. These are the moments that truly break the heart because you realise how lost Turtle is. How alone she is. How completely wrong in her beliefs about life she is. Personally I found the middle third of the novel to be the best part. The beginning, I think, shocked me to my core too much and I was unable to properly pick this novel up for a few days after starting. However, that middle third was where I was finally able to appreciate the aim of the writing. Sadly, I did feel that the climax of the novel let the story down. I was going to award four stars but changed my mind upon reading the ending. For me it felt much too dramatic and almost disingenuous to the soul of the book. I was not a fan of the pacing of the storyline; the first two thirds or so of the book had a fairly even pace but for the climax I don't think the change of pace was handled as delicately as it could have been. This is a thought provoking debut novel that deserves the hype it is getting. The author Stephen King is among its many fans. However, it is a book suited to a particular type of reader and sadly it seems, I am not the right kind. I would very much recommend it to anyone interested in literary fiction but who has a more suitable disposition than I do when reading a book containing such severe language and abusive situations. three stars*A copy of this book was kindly provided to me by the publisher, Harper Collins UK: 4th Estate, via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Vanessa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25545124-vanessa", "userReview": "Hard as I tried I just couldn\u2019t love this book.

For me the tie-breaker question is \"would I recommend this book to others?\". After thinking about it further, and hearing interviews with the author, my answer to that question is no.______Having finished My Absolute Darling feels like being chewed up and spat out, covered in muck. Reading this book is a grueling experience, and not one to be undertaken lightly.Equal parts compelling and appalling, I've seen other reviews describe My Absolute Darling as \"unputdownable\". Well, I did put it down. I put it down after a very confronting scene at the end of the first chapter. I put it down for over a month while I read other things and decided whether I wanted to continue with it at all.Now, to be fair, my first attempt at this book came at a bad time. This was the eighth (eighth!) book in a row to throw a surprise incest/child abuse/sexual assault storyline at me. It didn't matter what genre or type of book I picked up, this streak seemed like it would never end. I don't shy away from such difficult content, but nor do I deliberately seek it out, and being constantly blindsided was just too much.What's more, Tallent does not elide or obscure the horrific incidents as many authors do, he puts you in the room while they are happening and gives you the visceral details. It's incredibly tough to read at times.When I eventually returned to the book, I found a gripping story, powerfully told and with unforgettable characters. The tension created is palpable, almost unbearable at times, especially towards the end as the inevitable showdown looms and then plays out.Many scenes from this book will be etched on my memory. Not just the traumatic ones, but the quieter and tender moments too. It's a feat of writing that the setting and characters are so vividly rendered.

Turtle, our 14-year-old protagonist, lives alone with her father in Northern California. Their relationship is bizarre and stinging; Martin, the father, teaches Turtle to shoot and fend for herself. He uses extreme methods to raise her, meaning that some of the scenes in this book are almost too agonizing to read.This is one of those books that are hard to read, but very important! It takes some amazing twists and turns, and it wraps up beautifully in the end leaving the reader with a void inside (that way I haven't said too much). I hated this and I loved it!

Unfortunately, real life kind of got in the way and I failed to realize Banned Book Week was quickly approaching until I received the pop-up reminder on my calendar this morning. It just so happens that by some strange coincidence I had finished My Absolute Darling last week and (of course) had not yet written anything down. While not yet a \u201cbanned\u201d or \u201cchallenged\u201d book, I figure it will only be a matter of time before this selection becomes one due to its disturbing subject matter and the fact that since it is about a 14 year old girl, there\u2019s a good chance young people will want to read it.What you have here is a coming of age story about a girl who named Turtle (actual name Julia). Turtle is a girl who lives up to her moniker \u2013 attempting at all costs to stay inside the safety of her own shell to protect her family secret from getting out. And I\u2019m going to go ahead and spoil this because readers really need to know what they\u2019re getting into here before they decide to add this to their TBR: Turtle\u2019s father is not only emotionally and physically abusive throughout the story, but their relationship is also incestous. I picked this up because of my friend Jennifer\u2019s glowing review. Sadly, I didn\u2019t have a 5 Star reading experience like she did. I appreciate what the author tried to do, but there were some things that pulled me out of the story \u2013 and when you\u2019re reading something that should feel like getting hit in the face with a frying pan for the duration, being pulled away leaves you with a feeling almost like vertigo (which may be beneficial to many readers *shrug*). So what went wrong for me? Well, to begin with, this needed a heavier-handed editor. As I said before, it didn\u2019t always flow for me. My initial thought was it must have been translated to English due to the excessive use of adjectives and detailed descriptions of the local flora and fauna (and at times, Turtle\u2019s \u201cengorged\u201d bits *eww and also not really an accurate descriptor*), while the actual story itself (which should have been graphically brutal if it followed the author\u2019s pattern of writing) was lacking. Not to mention all the G.D. gun talk. If someone needs to be punched in the face like this one did with the foreshadowing, then they probably should stick to easy-readers. The choice of third person narration with everything being only from Turtle\u2019s perspective was off-putting as well. I think this would have been much more powerful if written in first person. The way it was I had tons of questions I wanted answers to that could have been provided (and I\u2019m usually one who is okay with not knowing every detail). But I wanted to know more about what made Martin a monster. Was his upbringing truly terrible? Did he repeat the sins of his father? Was he simply a bullshit artist? I wanted to be in his brain. First person would have made that impossible and I wouldn\u2019t be griping about it. I also assume Martin murdered Turtle\u2019s mother, but that was an open-ended matter as well. I\u2019ll leave it that I\u2019m dubious she died while \u201cabalone diving.\u201d While I do love the \u201cJohn Green\u201d type of teenager, Jacob and Brett were just a little too cool for school in my opinion. And then there was the little something extra (no spoilsies). This story didn\u2019t need a kitchen sink thrown in FFS. Not to mention the over-the-top climax and tidy little ending wrapped up in a bow. Some stories don\u2019t need to end well. This was one of them. As twisted as it is, if this was a YA book it would get more stars from me. I enjoy authors who are willing to push the envelope. As it was, this amounts to a decent debut.

Let me just say that I found it to be an incredibly compelling portrait of survival and coming-of-age: of a girl who is a survivor in the only way she knows how--by hunkering down in her shell (her nickname is Turtle, after all)--until at last she recognizes what she's been experiencing as the abuse it always was. It's also a book that eschews easy stereotypes. Turtle's abusive father, Martin, is an erudite left-wing gun-toting survivalist. To me the notion of survival forms the backbone of this book. Martin is convinced that climate change will soon destroy civilization and that Turtle needs survival skills more than she needs formal education. This sort of existential angst isn't made overly explicit, but it's always there in the background, driving him. You could almost see this book as a study in how people react in the face of impending doom. They don't act well; they retreat into themselves; they abuse their young. I don't want to suggest that any of this excuses Martin's behavior--and the narrative certainly doesn't suggest that at all--but I do see it as one of the drivers of his character and what makes him more than just a cardboard villain. Turtle too has a sense of nature as both an implacable foe and a force that gives her meaning and sustenance. You can see this in how attuned to nature she is, how she's a skilled hunter and survivalist in her own right. Her father taught her well. And this, in many ways, is her conundrum: that the father who taught her so much, who made her who she is and equipped her for survival, has also been traumatizing her for his own selfish ends. How can she ever become her own person, free from his abuse? Well, she can't really--she can just put her head down and do the one good thing he taught her: survive. And sometimes, that's enough."}, {"userName": "Cathy Branciforte", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2749367-cathy-branciforte", "userReview": "Did not finish....could not finish. Disliked this book a lot. I normally don't write about books that I don't finish and don't like giving negative reviews, but with all of the hype on this book, I thought there needed to be some balance of opinions. I really disliked it.....all of the boring descriptions of guns, the long descriptions of everything else. Once I started skimming over entire paragraphs, then pages, I knew I was not going to finish this book. I am sure I'm not the only one.PS. I have since discussed this book with 3 others who have read it and also disliked it, mainly for the themes, the long winded descriptions, the violence, etc. I think there are many readers who just don't review books or give their honest opinions on Goodreads. I tend to rely on the ratings on Goodreads and it does influence what I read and how long I stay with it until I just stop and move on. This was one of those that I thought was just me, but it's not."}, {"userName": "*TANYA*", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29049556-tanya", "userReview": "Gasp.

It's not okay to portray unspeakable violence against a child as though it were a thriller novel and posit it as high literary art. This book, with its overwritten prose that borders on the baroque, glorifies the rape and incest and abuse of Turtle by suggesting that the teen might possibly enjoy it, in her confused love for and loyalty to her sociopathic father. I am aware this book is a critics' darling. It is compulsively readable. Turtle and her friends are impossible not to adore and cheer for. The plot is compelling, until it becomes eye-rolling. The writing, when Tallent is not weighing it down with firearms or landscapes or adjectives\u2014oh, so very many many many adjectives\u2014is vivid and occasionally lovely. But it fails the very character it purports to celebrate. The writer sexualizes the violence against Turtle and demeans her at every step. Although nominally in close third person, Turtle's POV is distant and unnatural, revealing the writer's distance from his character and his exploitation of her as a means to a plot point. It is deeply frustrating and chilling in this era of #MeToo and #TimesUp that we still have to protest this shit: men co-opting women's stories and making money by glorifying their particular pain."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "[adult-on-child emotional/physical/sexual abuse, parent/child incest (not romanticized), kidnapping (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Peter Boyle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter-boyle", "userReview": "And so to the book that has everyone talking. A book bestowed with the highest praise of Stephen King, no less. Or perhaps lumbered with it. It makes me wish I'd read this novel without hearing the hype and having impossibly high expectations. But I can certainly see why it has generated such heated debate.14-year-old Julia \"Turtle\" Alveston is the focus of our attention. She lives on a sprawling, run-down farm with her father Martin, on the North California coast. With a survivalist attitude, Martin has taught Turtle how to take care of herself - she is handy with a gun and can skin a small animal with minimum fuss. But he also subjected her to all manner of abuse, and Turtle is wracked with anxiety and low self-esteem. On an excursion miles from her house, she encounters Jacob and Brett, two boys her own age. With their boundless enthusiasm and immediate extension of friendship, they offer Turtle the first glimpse of a promising future. But it will mean leaving Martin behind, and she doesn't know if she's brave enough for that.Turtle is a fascinating creation. We quickly realise how smart and resourceful she is, but she has a very unhealthy opinion of herself. Years of torture by her sociopathic father have turned her into a self-hating misogynist. She worships Martin - he has taught her everything she knows - but she also understands how dangerous he is: \"I need you to be hard on me, because I am no good for myself and you make me do what I want to do but cannot do for myself; but still, but still \u2014 you are sometimes not careful; there is something in you, something less than careful, something almost \u2014 I don't know, I am not sure, but I know it's there.\"It is the abuse in these pages which will set most tongues wagging. Emotional, physical and worst of all, sexual abuse. I would not consider myself squeamish or easily offended, but I struggled to make it through some of the more graphic passages. Gabriel Tallent certainly knows how to provoke a reaction, I'll give him that. It makes Turtle easy to root for - we read on in the hope that she can escape this monster's clutches, but we are also fearful for the consequences if it doesn't work out.I do have an issue with the dialogue in this story. I don't really understand why Jacob and Brett remain so besotted with Turtle. We know she has a lot going on in her head but externally she surely appears gruff and taciturn. She either responds in monosyllables or insults them, yet they always come back for more. And the boys don't talk like normal teenagers do. I know they are intelligent but they feel impossibly precocious, quoting the likes of Marcus Aurelius in lengthy soliloquys. At one point Jacob describes Martin as \"a colossal douchebag, among the worst to ever sail the lemon verbena seas, a primordial ur-douche the depth and profundity of whose douchism staggers the mind and beggars the imagination.\" That just doesn't ring true as natural teenage dialogue to me.But one thing Gabriel Tallent does extremely well is choreograph an action sequence. An eel fishing adventure that goes wrong, some DIY surgery and the breathless denouement - these are the scenes that will stand out in my mind when I remember this book. And in the tough as nails Turtle and the abominable Martin, he has given us two characters that will live long in the memory. My Absolute Darling is an engrossing, unsettling debut and like it or not, an unforgettable read."}, {"userName": "Sid Nuncius", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47323871-sid-nuncius", "userReview": "I thought My Absolute Darling was outstandingly good. It is beautifully written, remarkably insightful and completely gripping.This is the story of 12-year-old Julia \"Turtle\" Alveson who lives with her survivalist father on the fringes of society in Mendocino, California. She is skilled in guns, survival skills and so on, but at sea with other people and in social situations. Told entirely from Turtle's point of view, we see her struggles with understanding her father's obsessive and abusive behaviour which she (and probably he) believes to be what love is. As events and growing maturity begin to make her more aware, the tension between what she has believed and what she begins to recognise as reality grows and Turtle has to wrestle with where her future lies and how, if at all, she can realise it.This doesn't sound like a great read on the face of it, but it is. I genuinely found it hard to put this book down; the story is gripping, with some passages of incredible tension and real adventure, and Gabriel Tallent takes us right inside that young woman's head with her confusion, self-doubt (often spilling into self-loathing) and resilience in a way which I have seldom experienced. The portraits of her and of her monstrous father are fantastically real, and I found the entire thing completely convincing. Be warned that there are some quite horrifying scenes of child abuse, but they are absolutely justified in the context and excellently judged - a world away from the often offensively facile use of child abuse as a theme in run-of-the-mill thrillers.The prose is excellent. Gabriel Tallent writes in a measured, unmelodramatic but rather lyrical style, which brings the people, especially Turtle, wonderfully to life. Just as a tiny example, we get sentences like this: \"She waits there in the grass, feeling her every thought stored up and inarticulate within her,\" and this sort of brilliant distillation of internal experience shines through the book. The sense of place is excellent and dialogue is completely convincing; I especially liked some wonderful episodes of the jokey, wordy, literate chatter of two High School boys as it contrasted with Turtle's near-silent inarticulacy. I find it hard to express quite how good I thought this book was. It is a rare combination of an utterly gripping story, excellent writing and genuine depth of content. Very, very warmly recommended."}], "description": "Turtle Alveston is a survivor. At fourteen, she roams the woods along the northern California coast. The creeks, tide pools, and rocky islands are her haunts and her hiding grounds, and she is known to wander for miles. But while her physical world is expansive, her personal one is small and treacherous: Turtle has grown up isolated since the death of her mother, in the thrall of her tortured and charismatic father, Martin. Her social existence is confined to the middle school (where she fends off the interest of anyone, student or teacher, who might penetrate her shell) and to her life with her father.Then Turtle meets Jacob, a high-school boy who tells jokes, lives in a big clean house, and looks at Turtle as if she is the sunrise. And for the first time, the larger world begins to come into focus: her life with Martin is neither safe nor sustainable. Motivated by her first experience with real friendship and a teenage crush, Turtle starts to imagine escape, using the very survival skills her father devoted himself to teaching her. What follows is a harrowing story of bravery and redemption. With Turtle's escalating acts of physical and emotional courage, the reader watches, heart in throat, as this teenage girl struggles to become her own hero\u2014and in the process, becomes ours as well.", "title": "My Absolute Darling", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33572350-my-absolute-darling", "average": 3.68, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498911183l/33572350.jpg", "reviews": 3664, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16231256.Gabriel_Tallent", "name": "Gabriel Tallent"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Young Adult", "Did Not Finish", "Abandoned"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33572350-my-absolute-darling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33673469-my-absolute-darling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34675020-my-absolute-darling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35687202-my-absolute-darling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34816838-my-absolute-darling"]}
