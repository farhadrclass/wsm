I tell students and aspiring writers that making theirs unique and personal to them is absolutely essential. I tell myself that I have to keep pushing to improve the one I've already developed in my own stories.Because voice...it's the blanket we build that the reader wraps themselves in while they read our work. The voice can be warm and fuzzy.It can be heavy and soft.It can be prickly and slightly itchy.It can be a million different sensations.One thing I've never even considered, though, is how it can completely change within a story.Marisa Reichardt's Underwater does just that. She introduces us to Morgan, a teenager under a self-imposed house arrest. We don't know exactly why Morgan won't go outside. We catch glimpses of the events that led her to be so scared of the world beyond the threshold. She hints at it, comments on it, reminisces on the tragedy, and we feel every short breath, every skipped heartbeat, every bit of weight carried around by this girl. All because of the voice Reichardt wraps us in.But then...There's Evan. Morgan's mom. Morgan's brother. Her therapist. Her own desire to regain that connection with the life she's turned her back on. And the voice begins to change.It's so subtle. So gradual and smooth that I didn't actually catch it at first. I was about three quarters through the book when I noticed that I could breathe easier. I was smiling. I wasn't gripping the edges of the book so hard that the cover was getting wrinkled. So I flipped back several chapters and realized that Reichardt had been weaving an entirely new blanket for me while I'd been reading. Everything from the descriptive language to the overall sentence structure had been evolving right under my nose without me knowing it. It's brilliant. And so perfect for this story. Because this story is all about change and moving on. We finally discover what's been keeping Morgan locked inside her house all this time. And while this story doesn't get wrapped up in a tidy, neat, bow in some Disney-esque ending, it does leave us with such a wonderful sense of hope.This is a book I hope everyone reads at some point. For students and teachers, it's so relevant. To readers, it's rich with complexity. To writers, it's a study in how an author can create a character so compelling, so layered with emotion, one who changes so much within a story, that the voice has a complete arc of its own, too. And that's why I'm giving Underwater by Marisa Reichardt a full five stars. Her book not only was a heartbreaking read that left me smiling, it made me want to become a better writer.I received an advance copy of UNDERWATER in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/\nOn October 15th Morgan\u2019s life changed forever.

I wish our society didn\u2019t need this. Parents shouldn\u2019t have to fear for their children every time they went to school but every day, they worry and it breaks my heart to think of how we have to live this way. I know the root cause hasn\u2019t been addressed yet especially in the U.S and I\u2019m not sure if it ever will be so until then, books like this are a simple way to comfort and console those of us who survived such tragic events.The story centers around Morgan, a survivor of a mass high school shooting. Most of the story happens in her small apartment where she has spent the last five months of her life since the shooting. Afraid of everything, she doesn\u2019t dare step foot out their apartment door until Evan, the too friendly neighbor comes along. A lot of readers will probably complain why the catalyst for a girl\u2019s change has to be a guy all the time but I really don\u2019t mind in this particularly case because Evan is a great guy who is really right for Morgan. Of course it helps greatly that she has a cool therapist , an adorable little brother and a supportive mother who together form a small but strong network of people to help her get through a difficult phase of her life. At first, I was bothered by the choppy writing but then slowly understood that this is Morgan speaking. The sadness is loud in her words and clipped sentences but as the story progresses, a significant change in her tone is obvious as she opens herself up to getting better, to getting help and helping herself. Overall, its\u2019 a well written story, easy to read, relatable and genuine."}, {"userName": "Paula M. of Her Book Thoughts!", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23287093-paula-m-of-her-book-thoughts", "userReview": "'It turned out I wasn't dying on the outside. I was only dying on the inside, where nobody could see.'\n\u00a0Wow. Underwater stunned me! This is the first 2016 book that I read for this year and boy what a good choice! This debut novel deserves to be in your to read list people, but don't make it stay there for too long. In fact, after reading my review, I highly suggest that you pick this book up immediately and get to reading.\u00a0Morgan doesn't go outside anymore. She study online, she meets with her therapist at her house and she only talks with her mother and her brother. Any other interaction besides that gets her nervous and gives her panic attack. There's a reason behind why Morgan turned out to be this way. You see, she is not used to be like that. But an incident that she witnessed changed everything.\u00a0There's a lot to be praised about Underwater but I'll start with the author's vivid and lyrical writing. It's impossible to read this book without the words tugging your heartstrings. Every emotion that Morgan feels are easily rolling off through the pages and you can't help but feel with her. Her sadness, anxiety, excitement and of course even her joy. Throughout the whole book I feel like Morgan was just a close friend, and she's telling me her story. And I'm savoring each word.\u00a0We can all agree that the plot has been done before. I have read some already. In fact, the concept is not at all new. And like I say everytime, I admire the authors who writes realistic fictions such as this. But what makes Underwater stands out? Underwater doesn't shy away with every issue that a person like Morgan encounters. This novel is raw and real. Every character is alive and will affects you in their own ways. But the most important thing that Underwater have is that it makes you aware. It makes you think! What if you're in the position of Morgans mother? What if you have a friend just like Morgan? What if you're in Morgan's shoes?\u00a0There was a romance aspect in this novel as well but its not really the main point of the story. The guy didn't save Morgan, she saved herself. She didn't save herself for the guy either. She did it for herself. And that's what's important to me.A powerful and mesmerizing novel. That's what Underwater is. There are A LOT of books coming out this year and I'm sure your TBR is already stuffed. But this book is not something you want to miss. Underwater is important, real and provocative. I can't wait to hear more of Marisa Reichardts contribution in the YA table."}, {"userName": "Chelsea \u2764Peril Please\u2764 ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8422853-chelsea-peril-please", "userReview": "1. Breathe2. You are okay.3. You are not dying.\n\n\nProbably my newest and most shocking addiction, book genre wise, is realistic fiction. It might be a surprise to some people who don\u2019t know how neurotic I am (cough, everyone knows, cough) that there was a time before GR (B.GR.) I didn\u2019t like books that made me feel too heavy or weighed down. I still, admittedly, don\u2019t like to feel depressed while reading because it is supposed to be an escape, but my views have changed almost completely-Reading a story that isn\u2019t sugar coated doesn\u2019t make me heavier\u2026.\nit makes me feel whole.\n\nI swim. I float. I breathe. I burn. I hope. I dream. I think. I wonder. I am.\nLet me explain: Before, when I read a book that wasn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, action-packed, full of romance, seeped in the paranormal (perhaps another shocking fact seeing as I don\u2019t read many paranormals anymore), I didn\u2019t find it enjoyable. I found it boring, lacking, and without intrigue. But for some reason, the wonderful year of 2015 was my year of change, my year of adventure, my year of trying new things, expanding my horizons, and, ultimately, stepping widely out of my comfort zone. And it greatly benefitted me. I now have so many favorites for 2015 that I couldn\u2019t possibly list them or remember them all. And, believe me, that\u2019s a good thing! Now, since I was so wonderfully stretched this year, I found a new favorite nook to \u2018hide\u2019 myself in-Realistic Fiction. \nI swear, when I read the first book that was RF in 2015, I literally-literally-face palmed myself. I wasted so many years being a snob, lifting my nose haughtily in the air, turning the other way when realistic fiction was nudged in my direction, that my head was shoved so far up my ass I missed some absolute favorites that I may never find again. Sure, I\u2019ve swept up quite a few\u2026and they were fabulous. But there are so many that I\u2019ve passed over that I will never be able to find all of them again...and that makes me want to curl up in a ball and cry. But that\u2019s neither here nor there. 2015 may have been my best year for books ever, but 2016 will be the year of capitalization. I want to take all the wonderful stories I read in 2015 and use them as inspiration for what I NEED to read in 2016-and this is my first realistic fiction of the year. If this is any indication of what my year will be like\u2026I have no reason to be scared, only good things are heading my way.\nHe chuckles as he rounds the corner and slides down next to me. He knocks his knee against mine. \"You okay? Was it too dark, maybe?\"\"I don't think my problem was the lights being out.\"\"I meant the play. That was some pretty dark shit for a bunch of kindergartners.\" \nLOL >.<I don\u2019t quite know how to explain what this story is about without ruining it, so I\u2019ll be brief. Morgan\u2019s life has been turned upside down: she doesn\u2019t leave her apartment, she takes online classes instead of attending high school, and she sees a therapist every Tuesday and Thursday\u2026in her apartment. She can\u2019t watch the news and she regularly has panic attacks. Her life used to be normal-parties, boys, best friends, and swimming for her high school team. Her life was everything she could ever hope for\u2026.and then it wasn\u2019t. One fateful day-October fifteenth-forever shaped her in ways she never imagined possible. Guilt threatens to smother her and secrets almost bury her alive. If only if only\u2026.if only it hadn\u2019t happened. If only he hadn\u2019t been there\u2026if only. What if [less than] one hour of horror took everything good away from you in the blink of an eye-extinguished all your hopes and dreams by taking your freedom from you in an instant. What would you do? Morgan can\u2019t even fathom walking outside her apartment. Well...at least until Evan moves in next door. \nAnd that's one more thing that makes me know that even though Evan and I live next door to each other, we are miles apart. He will leave his house every day.He will traipse through the courtyard of our building.I will watch him go. He will be a boy living out in the world. I will be a girl peeking out from behind a curtain.\n\nAaahhhh Evan!!!! I adored him, naturally. He was sweet, kind, caring, endearing, loyal, and everything that Morgan needed. He really was so much more than a love interest. He was her rock. He was her light at the end of the tunnel. He was the person that created the spark that stoked her inner fire again. He may have been just one of many inspirations in her life, because she adores her brother and mother, but he was the oxygen she needed to come back to life\u2026.he was her lifeline. \n\"You weren't swimming. You were sitting at the bottom of the pool doing nothing.\"\"I was thinking!\"\"Well, stop thinking!\"\"How am I supposed to do that?\"\n\nAnd it\u2019s crazy because, while I thought he would have a large part in the story since he was in it so much at the beginning, he really wasn\u2019t in it near as much as I\u2019d have hoped. But that\u2019s my point-he wasn\u2019t an extremely large part, but he had a massive impact and burrowed himself deep in my heart. She pushed him away and pushed him away and shunned him, one of my problems with the story even though I could never possibly understand her pain, yet he never gave up on her. It warmed my heart and soul, lighting me from the inside out, igniting my warm fuzzies and fluttery butterflies.\n\"I didn't want it to get cold. That's why I needed you to open up,\" he says. \"Thanks, Superman.\"He grins like he's relieved I'm calling him that. I notice dimples digging into his tan cheeks. There's a part of me that wants to nudge my pointer finger into one of them because they're so cute. \"I'm not superman. Clark Kent, maybe. Not Superman.\"\nThe bonds formed in this book, her mother, brother, Evan, her friends, Brenda [her therapist], they were beautiful. They were by far the biggest highlight and strongest selling point in this story, and I found the relationships wholly realistic-they were honest and raw, gritty and deep. Relationships aren\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows, puppies and kittens, flowers and unicorns-they are harsh and true and fragile as glass\u2026but if you open yourself up, trust in others and in yourself, they can be the most rewarding asset in your life.\nMorgan\u2019s struggles resonated deeply within me\u2026until they didn\u2019t. Ouch, okay, hear me out. The beginning was so strong, and I adored every minute, even in the end. But at one point, when she began to push Evan away (repeatedly) I had a hard time connecting with it. And that\u2019s the thing, you don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s the truth. People have moments in their lives where they are at their lowest and they can\u2019t believe someone would want to go through it with them-for them, and that\u2019s where I lost my ability to understand. I hurt when she hurt, I ached when she ached, and I yearned when she yearned\u2026.but for about ten percent at one point (you\u2019ll know when) I couldn\u2019t fathom why she went there. Other than that?? This book was perfection..and I can\u2019t imagine never having learned about it.Her journey, her quest to restore faith in humanity-and the world-is one I don\u2019t know I could have traveled. A quote from my favorite series of all time sums up Morgan\u2019s life perfectly-\n\u2019It takes ten times as long to pull yourself together as it does to fall apart\u2019\n. And it\u2019s true. It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s right. But most importantly, it applies to me. If what happened to her had happened to me, I might not have been as strong or as courageous as she (well, she gets there, that\u2019s the whole point). It took one moment, maybe 20 minutes, for her world to shatter into oblivion\u2026.yet it took her months to try and walk out her door. Being reduced to a heaping, crumpled pile on the floor is a harsh thing\u2026but it\u2019s what we do after that defines who we are. I only hope I never have to live through such a tragedy\u2026but if I do, I hope I\u2019ll have the courage to put one foot in front of the other and live my life to the fullest. It\u2019s all any of us can do.

It seemed quite obvious that she was suffering once I got into the book, and her limitations because of it was pretty harsh.The storyline in this was part mystery \u2013 over what had actually happened to Morgan at school, and part contemporary romance as Morgan met her new neighbour Evan. This blended quite well and the story flowed nicely, although I did want to find out what had happened a bit quicker than we did.The ending to this was pretty good, and I was pleased that Morgan was able to make the progress she did.6.5 out of 10"}, {"userName": "April (Aprilius Maximus)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20658145-april-aprilius-maximus", "userReview": "[there was a school shooting (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Milka", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1982249-milka", "userReview": "Oh man, this is one of those books that's really hard to review for two reasons. One, I did not want to give away any of the mystery of the book and thus spoil it for someone. Two, I ABSOLUTELY FREAKING LOVED IT AND WRITING REVIEWS FOR BOOKS THAT I JUST WANT TO SHOUT LOVING THINGS ABOUT IT DIFFICULT. I want to start by suggesting that you ADD THIS TO YOUR GOODREADS RIGHT NOW, PREORDER IT AND THEN START TO COUNT DAYS FOR JANUARY 12TH BECAUSE WITH THIS BOOK, YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT. I had heard good things about Underwater from some of my blogging pals, but I never expected it to be this good. And I am kind of happy I didn't, because though I generally do not like surprises, being surprised by a book is one of the best things I know. Underwater focuses on Morgan who hasn't left her apartment for months. Instead of going to normal high school, she has spend most of the junior year taking online classes that allow her to stay inside in her pajamas. She has a rhythm - take classes, watch TV, eat tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches every day for lunch. Why does not Morgan go outside, you may ask? She is scared. She is afraid of losing control. She is terrified of the things that can happen to her if she leaves the protective walls of the apartment. She feels like danger lurks everywhere. No place is safe, expect her apartment. And going to a normal school, living normal life like she used to, feels like something she can never do again.When Evan moves to the apartment next door, he brings with him the smell of ocean and sun. He reminds Morgan of the time before her life came crashing down. He gives her hope of maybe someday being okay again. But unlike Evan, Morgan cannot go outside, even if a part of her would want it. Morgan does not want to burden Evan with her reality, but at the same time she feels like Evan might be able to help her. And maybe Morgan can help Evan too, since she knows something about what happened to someone close to Evan. There's much more to this book than the slowly budding relationship of Morgan and Evan. I loved the relationship between Morgan and Brenda, the therapist Morgan sees twice a week. This kind of patient-therapist relationships are extremely important because of the stigma that is still unfortunately present. I feel like too often relationships like this are portrayed without proper research and because of that they are flat, prejudiced and tend to support the stigmatized attitudes. Reichardt carefully and skillfully builds the relationship between Morgan and Brenda, showing the benefits of therapy and what goes into the process.There's also wonderful family dynamics found from this novel. I loved the relationship between Morgan and her little brother who does not quite understand why Morgan is staying inside, but manages to provide her with support, love and distractions. The dynamic between Morgan and her mother is also extremely interesting, especially after Morgan's distant father is added to the mix. Reichardt writes so well and in a way that made it impossible for me to put this book down. The way she writes the thoughts and feelings of Morgan is extremely touching and easy to connect with despite the fact that I have never experienced the things Morgan goes through. By the end of this book, I had tears in my eyes, because the power of Reichardt prose and characterization managed to take me by storm.There was an element to this book that I did not expect at all. I don't want to spoil it to anyone because I loved the process of figuring it out, puzzling together the pieces of information Reichardt gives, but I can say that it has something to do with why Morgan is so afraid. Though the subject matter of the book and the things Morgan goes through can get very dark, this novel has an incredible sense of hope and new changes that are up for grabs as soon as soon as Morgan feels like she's ready. Underwater is an incredibly promising, mind-blowingly good debut novel that makes me eagerly anticipate Reichardt's future as an author."}, {"userName": "S.M.

The MC deals with anxiety and PTSD and this trauma-induced illness forces her to shut herself inside a small California apartment. But there is nothing gloomy about this novel. Morgan, our heroic MC, has so much depth and competence throughout her story and remains connected to the deepest love for her little brother and mother. The little brother, incidentally, jumps off the page with his boyish charm and innocence, which is contextualized within his own struggle to accept their family\u2019s shifted reality. The microcosm in this apartment is filled with enough hope and support to keep the reader cheering for the main character\u2019s recovery. Step by step. The ease of this author\u2019s language lulls you into Morgan\u2019s world, her story, her struggle. The writing is never heavy-handed. And the anxiety and mental illness born of a traumatic event? It is handled with such authentic expertise that I know readers will easily be able to identify with Morgan. With all her strengths and weaknesses. They will see themselves reflected in her insights, fears, needs. She is real. She is flawed. She is complex and gorgeous in her complexity. And she embodies strength in every literal step she takes toward defining how she can live in the outside world. There is also a love interest, and Evan couldn\u2019t be more amazing. He\u2019s as easy as a California beach day, accepts Morgan for who she is and meets her there without ever forcing her to move outside her comfort zone. Plus, he\u2019s hilarious and swoony and smart\u2014and also quiet when he needs to be. What I found most compelling about the love interest was that he was never the catalyst for Morgan\u2019s recovery, a solution a less competent writer could have easily woven into the storyline. Instead, Evan\u2019s acceptance and patience allows Morgan the physical and mental space she needs to recover. Is she lured to the California beach air? It\u2019s sand? His abs? The water she craves? Yes. And this tension lives throughout the story. But Morgan must decide if this journey beyond her anxiety is one that she wants to take for herself. Not for a boy. Not forced for another. This is an honest read about a teen girl struggling with the crippling effects of anxiety and I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED these pages. It\u2019s hard to imagine a YA fan that wouldn\u2019t."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4233746-janet", "userReview": "LYRICAL, SPARE, AND RICH, all at the same time.

The words were alternately claws digging into me, sirens in my ears, weight on my chest, tears in my eyes. What Morgan felt, I felt. I spent a lot of this book hurting because she was hurting so badly. As an author, making readers care about a character that intensely is not easy to do. This is a testament to Marisa Reichardt's jaw-dropping talent. As devastating as this book is, there is also so much hope infused in the pages. It's the kind of hope that feels slippery and out of reach at times, and that makes it real. There are different levels of hope and strength and they're intertwined. Sometimes they're twisted up in a knot but if they can get out of that knot, they can both become lifelines. When the book starts, Morgan is too scared to step onto her welcome mat. But as the story goes on, she gets stronger in so many ways. You'll cheer for every inch of her progress. If you're like me, you might cheer out loud and startle the Chihuahua sleeping on your lap. Marisa's prose is piercing. It's a storm and a lullaby. The scope of her skill as an author is enormous and I'm still in awe. She has the rare ability to write the kind of voice that not just fully absorbs a reader, but fills the reader up. Her talent is both jaw-dropping and inspiring. This is a book I need to read again. (Good thing I preordered months ago!) This is a book everyone needs to read. This is a book that has imprinted itself on my heart."}, {"userName": "Kels", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28386116-kels", "userReview": "Why can't I be happy to be alive instead of afraid of living?If you're in between books or looking for your next great read, I highly suggest picking this novel up. I've been in such a massive reading slump lately, but this book shook me right out of it. It managed to hold my attention from start to finish, and quite honestly for a debut novel to tackle such heavy and important topics, Underwater completely took me by surprise and stunned me.Marisa Reichardt's writing is artfully balanced. Her prose is compelling, sharp, and tightly woven. Even though I wasn't able to read this in one sitting--busy, busy week for me--I was still able to fly through reading this because it was so easy on the eyes, and incredibly hard to put down. The pacing does seem to fall a little on the slow side at first, but now looking back I see that it is steadied and consistent. It never once dragged for me, nor was I ever bored, but it does take its time building up the characters in a way I can most certainly appreciate. It moves along unhurried and I think that made such a huge difference in how I was able to identify with the main character, Morgan. Speaking of Morgan, I was actually quite surprised at just how much I was able to relate to her and connect with her extreme fear of the outside world. Agoraphobia is one of those fears that I just never really understood how it could be so crippling and panic-inducing, (I mean, there are lots of ways to die at home, you know? Reason #79 as to why I could never be a psychologist.) but the author did such an excellent job of putting Morgan's trauma into a perspective that I could easily make sense of. Reading this book helped me to understand how one moment, one event can change everything about you. It can alter your perceptions. It can place a seed of fear inside you that, that without proper help, can grow out of control and trample you to the ground. I get that now. And I'm so much better because of it. There's also a strong focus on family, which of course I loved. Morgan's family didn't fade into the background. They were there by her side through her hiccups, her breakdowns, and her triumphs. They were supportive and encouraging and gave her the extra push she sometimes needed. But they also existed with problems of their own. You see the toll that Morgan's illness takes on her mom and brother. You understand her mother's exhaustion when she comes home from a hard day of laborious work and still have to work to keep her family together. You get that her brother has a hard time understanding what's going on. And as a bonus, you see that depression and trauma manifests in many forms through her father, who also needs help to combat demons of his own.There's also a romance and let's face it, it's of the insta-love variety. But I didn't mind it so much because it doesn't at all overwhelm the plot in my opinion, and was such a sweet addition. In fact, I think it actually added to the story by showing the importance of Morgan moving forward by reconnecting with not just past friendships but also engaging in new and intimate ones. And okay, maybe the book could have done without it by just allowing Evan and Morgan to blossom as friends, but I still swooned over Evan like it was nobody's business. ;)Underwater is a quiet, heartfelt debut novel about overcoming fear and moving forward through life's setbacks, rediscovering yourself when you fall apart, and learning how to forgive others while also learning the importance of forgiving yourself. More people should be talking about this book. There's a lot of depth to this novel and Marisa Reichardt tackles some very tough topics with an ease that is wholly impressive and feels honest and unforced. Underwater isn't a perfect novel, but it deserves every last one of these five stars I'm giving it. It's a moving and realistic portrayal of trauma, and although it's a short, quick read it packs quite a punch."}, {"userName": "Peach", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16862870-peach", "userReview": "Magic.

The rhythm of the writing was wonderful (there were a lot of short sentences as paragraphs that worked with story and made it even better). The writing pulled at me, evoked a response. It was just . . . pretty. The story itself is wonderful too. It's about bravery and living and caring for others. It leaves an impact.I could hear Morgan's voice loud and clear (or just clear since she had a quiet demeanor). I could easily picture the scenes because of that (and the writing). There was so much feeling in her POV. I could easily connect to her and really feel was she was feeling because it felt so vividly described.There were a couple things that I didn't like. The story lost its momentum towards the end--or maybe that was just me that felt less connected than before--so I didn't get a strong last impression of this book. I felt a much bigger impact from the first three quarters of the book than I did the last one. I also wish I got to now the supporting characters on a deeper level because I don't have much at all to say about them. Ben was really sweet!

It begs to be read in one sitting and commands to be felt deeply. Underwater is a story about Morgan, a 16-year-old girl suffering from agoraphobia after a traumatic event. Morgan hasn\u2019t left the house in months \u2013 she attends school online, has her own little rituals while her family is away and she meets her pro bono therapist in her own living room. Even the thought of going outside makes her panic until the right motivation comes along.When I talk about motivation, I want it to be clear that Evan, the boy that moves in next door, isn\u2019t some easy fix for her illness. I was afraid of that approach when I first read the description, but Reichardt was very careful not to make it seem superficial and easy. She gave Morgan time to heal on her own. Morgan was pushed by her desire to spend time with Evan, but there were so many steps she needed to take first and all of them had very little to do with him. Morgan\u2019s issues aren\u2019t the only thing she faces in this book. Her father struggles with mental illness and alcoholism after many tours in Afghanistan. Morgan doesn\u2019t understand how her father could abandon his family. She can\u2019t forgive him for time lost and for choosing to be homeless rather than live with them. This was, perhaps, the most genuine, honest part of the book. I love that Morgan had to go through her own condition and disappointments in order to better understand her dad. Their (non)relationship was done exceptionally well and I admire Marisa Reichardt for approaching the subject so tactfully. Once again, no easy fixes were offered because such things simply don\u2019t exist in life, but one could take away a strong message of hope even with the open ending and issues that were left unresolved.I love Reichardt\u2019s style mostly because it\u2019s understated. She knows how to convey genuine emotions without resorting to cheap tear-jerkers. The things she introduced in Underwater are some of the biggest open wounds of modern society and yet they were done sensitively and thoughtfully. I can\u2019t wait to see what she does next."}, {"userName": "Julie Eshbaugh", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3334229-julie-eshbaugh", "userReview": "UNDERWATER is about the process of healing, and the powerful way our connectedness can influence that process. The central story is about a girl recovering from a terrible trauma, but there are so many other stories here, too, and they all weave together so beautifully. That's the way this book felt to me... woven like a tapestry, with relationships binding everything together. There were scenes that felt like snapshots--vivid and alive like snapshots from my own family's albums. So many moments (even very small, seemingly incidental moments,) would spring off the page with warmth and life and love, and despite the darkness of the subject matter, my heart would fill with light. There's so much hope in this book--the hope that comes from stubborn determination. Morgan struggles, but she's a fighter. I loved her journey, and I loved this book!

That's really not the case for me! Three stars is a generally positive rating, but it can also mean a lot of different things. It's a book that's good but not special. It's a book that I'm glad I read but probably won't re-read. It's a book that did not meet the high expectations I set for it, despite being an overall enjoyable read. Or, as is the case with Underwater, it's a book that had, quite simply, a mix of elements that worked for me and those that didn't. Now that I got that out of the way, I can certainly see why so many early reviews have gushed about it. The story is very, very timely for what's going in the United States today. It's relevant, and this type of plot line will always hold that sort of haunting feeling. I'm being purposely vague because it takes Morgan, our main character, a little while to reveal exactly what happened to her. Which is actually one of the reasons I struggled with the book, especially in the beginning. I even wanted to put it down for good at one point, because I was not connecting to Morgan at all, and the writing style was definitely something I had to get used to. I wasn't a fan of her narration. But - and this is for readers who want to give up early on like I did - pushing through to the why of the situation is ultimately rewarding. I felt really bad at first because the aftermath of what Morgan is going through - her anxiety, her guilt - is horrible, yet I felt very distanced from her. Her agoraphobia felt like a plot device. I hate to say it, but I couldn't help but think the book a poor man's Everything, Everything.But like I said, the book did improve for me, and I thought Morgan's growth and healing, especially in regards to her tricky relationship with her dad, was very well done. I love that there was a strong theme of family, and that the one person Morgan thought she could never understand or forgive is someone she learned from, by way of his own mistakes and because she was mature enough to see her own situation reflected in his. She does a lot of growing up in this book, and even though some of the situations toward the end seemed too contrived, that at least was handled with more complexity. I do wish the romance had been stronger. The love interest is bland and uninspiring and I couldn't get into their relationship in the slightest. Which, knowing me, is a bummer. With all the glowing reviews out there, I wish I could have liked Underwater more, but I'm glad that at least in the second half I was finally able to connect to the story and sympathize more with Morgan. It's definitely a book that would be great for a book club, with lots of potential for discussion. I will be reading more reviews of it, for sure!

So says Aurora. Though I may catch flak from the Creature from the North herself for quoting her whilst listening to Warpaint's new album Heads up. Under the water, you can't breathe you can't breathe.But.This is a story about a girl who breathes under water. It's the only place she feels safe, in fact it is the only place she can breathe, you see?It's strange, as it often is with strange beauty and stranger things. It is odd, I have been going through some personal stuff, nothing major just hangups mostly, so in a sense I am stuck in a stasis, though however sweet that state is, it is still stasis nonetheless. What I am saying is, I get it, not wanting to leave the sanctuary of your own making. Now I am not comparing wounds, fictional or real nor I am belittling Morgan here, who because of her name reminds me of Eva Green in Camelot a very game precursor of Game of Thrones circa April 2011. And hey, in this new song anything is possible.Anyway, the point is I understand wanting to shut out the world, I can relate if only a little but I do relate to it. The book as a whole felt aqueous,very, and I liked that. Without being overblown this could be seen in another way; a mermaid finding her way into the water again, after being hurt that is. This book was about healing and accepting. Sometimes they are one and the same. Two thingsa ) I didn't realize this was about school shooting but it was all background stuff. All saddening but I guess after so many shootings, numbness is all there is at this point. b ) wasn't expecting romance of any kind but that's what happened from the get-go, a catalyst of sorts, that's what was offered from the start and I guess it was serviceable though a little fictiony and unrealistic. And let's face it, the whole romance and Evan on whole felt tacked on, I mean I didn't buy it. Also Evan did something questionable and it was never explained. I thought maybe it was a ploy to get Morgan out of her shell but nope, that was just Evan being a dick. um, did anyone else noticed few similarities between this and Great American Whatever novel? How this was also about a MC refusing to venture out? Morgan however spent more time indoors than Quinn did, that's for sure. But her character, her story, her arc, her getting through her very real pain was written so beautifully, trauma handled just right. Morgan's the type of character I wanted to like immediately. I really liked Morgan. Sometimes that's even better than actually liking, wanting to like. Should you read this novel? This is kinda book that you can finish in one sitting and I did, more or less. It helped me. Immensely. It was familial that way. It made me want to want again, to go out again, to get a jar paint my face and grab summer again, though this is fall. It made me feel colors again and want to eat them too. So should you read this? I don't know. But for me, after a long while, just like last September it made me feel like me again. This marks the third instance where I came across something featuring surfing and unrelated suffering attached to it, makes me wanna get on a board. So what were they? KeeperThe Shallows (a very watery Blake Lively)and thisUnderwater and can we say, what an awesome UK edition, love it. Prefer it and got this version for that very cover. Happy trails everyone. Back to water.codicil : I just remembered, Under the water was one of the first books of 2016 that I wanted to read. In fact, it was the very first I added to read here back in Dec 2015 I think.

All the other survivors seem to be getting their lives back together, but Morgan can\u2019t seem to move on. She spends her days cooped up in the apartment she shares with her mum and brother until some new neighbours move in next door who might just give her the push she needs to reconnect with the outside world.I have to say, I really loved this book. It drew me in from the first page and didn\u2019t let me go until the heart-warming ending. The first thing that struck me about Underwater was the author\u2019s style of writing. It\u2019s kind of sparse with short sentences, not flowery or purple-prosey at all and the vocabulary is uncomplicated. And yet the author manages to use exactly the right word in every situation so that the reader gets a fantastic sense of place and really feels what Morgan is going through.Considering Morgan spends the majority of the book shut away in her apartment, there are a surprising number of strands to this story. On the one hand we have the way she attempts to deal with her current situation and her fears for the future, but the story also delves into the past - both into the events of last year in her high school, and also into her childhood and her relationship with her father.And the characters. All of them were well-written and well-rounded with plenty of dimensions and flaws and merits. I loved the relationships between them all and how they all suffered with their guilt There is some romance in this, but it\u2019s not overpowering.

I tend to gravitate towards the lighter ones but whenever I do find a good book that deals with grief, loss, and tragedy, I try to take as many of the impactful lessons to heart as I can.I really liked the characters and relationships in this book. A tragedy at school affects Morgan so deeply that she confines herself to her apartment, too frightened of the outside world to consider leaving. She struggles to recover from her PTSD, anxiety, and guilt, and we see Morgan battle her way back to her former self and life. Morgan has such a quirky personality, which I love about her. Her honesty and determination to get better make her such an admirable protagonist. I was rooting for her the whole time.Evan, her new next-door neighbor really helps Morgan along the way to recovery. He's so understanding and sweet, and I love their dialogues. The romance was pretty cute and kept on the side. I appreciate that it didn't overshadow the plot nor did the romance resemble the \"solution\" to all of Morgan's problems. Besides their friendship and eventual relationship, I loved Morgan's family. Her little brother, Ben, is so adorable and inadvertently helps Morgan's progress.Underwater is a special book for so many reasons. The writing is simply flawless. I love how the writing perfectly captures the mood of the story. The pacing is quick, and the story is absorbing from the beginning to the end. The tragedy of the story is revealed to us in small parts throughout the story, and I thought that worked really well in the novel. Morgan's character growth throughout is astounding. I loved seeing her will and progression advance. The messages in this story are well portrayed and well executed. I deeply enjoyed all this book had to offer!I felt Underwater was a great book, yet it didn't really stand out as a favorite book. The ending was cute yet too picture-perfect.

Of course her reason to live in fear everyday isn't something to completely hate her for. She lived through something tragic, a school shooting.
