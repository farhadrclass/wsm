I just love this series and I just couldn't put the book down and finished it in two days. It was a powerful, intriguing, heart pounding non stop adrenaline rush. I love it when a book does that to me! I just love Kate. I just love her character.Kate Burkholder is a tough as nails Chief of Police. She gets a call to go undercover by the sheriff's department in a rural community in New York. There is something strange going on in an Amish community and Kate is perfect for the undercover work. Her Amish upbringing will help her fit in nicely. I loved Kate and her drive to find the truth. She is determined to find out why a young girl was found dead in the woods . The author does a great job of having Kate blend in to the community as a widow. I must say her living quarters were funny. Imagine an old trailer with pink as the main color, rickety floors, dated furniture and there you have Kate's new home as she lives in the new community. I immediately disliked The Bishop. His character was scary, forceful and very controlling. The author really played his character up as he becomes more sinister as the story unfolds. I would not like to run into him in a dark alley. His presence is overpowering and he seems to have a hold on the community much like a cult leader would. Kate's boyfriend Agent John Tomasetti makes it clear that he is not happy that Kate is going undercover. I liked his protectiveness of Kate and was pleasantly surprised when he didn't make to much of a fuss when she decides to go undercover. The town Kate goes to is a typical Amish town but it seems that the town is lacking tourists. I did like the women who welcomed Kate to their sewing circle. were very sweet and made Kate feel at ease. But Kate wonders why there are so many businesses closed? What has caused some of the community to fear The Bishop? Get ready for a thriller that has lots of action, some violence and lots of surprises. This is one book that will keep you up late into the night as you furiously turn pages to read . It is a top notch edge of your seat mystery that will keep you guessing till the end. Can Kate trust anyone in the town? Will her life be in danger as she unravels the secrets buried deep within the community? This book is a heart pounder for sure. It is sadly to say that I am already caught up and up to date in this series and I just hope that I don't have to wait to long for the next book."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "I have loved this series from the beginning, but in the last few years have been able to identify more personally.

Made the acquaintance of these wonderful people, have tasted their food and their delicious homemade ice cream. In this one Chief Katie Burkholder may have gotten over her head, when she is asked to go undercover in upstate New York, after a young Amish girl is found dead. Unable to get any information from the Amish community there, with their natural suspicion of the English, Kate poses as what she once was, an Amish woman. There she finds a Bishop who his people seem to admire and fear. Things are not as clear cut as they appear, as she soon finds out.Suspenseful, many twists and turns, secrets, betrayals.

The story takes place in the winter. One thing you do not want to do here when the temperature is 18\u00b0 F and the windchill is below zero is fall through the ice! How the Amish survive in these conditions without electricity is a wonder to me. I was chilled just reading about the outdoor adventures Kate Burkholder experiences in this book.Kate agrees to go undercover in an Amish community to find out why a 15 year old girl was killed. As a former Amish and current police chief, she is uniquely qualified. Linda Castillo has given Kate the opportunity to see what her life might have been like if she'd stayed Amish, and Kate gets a little nostalgic. The reader gets a wonderful look at the lives of Amish women.Don't get all cozy, though. There is a murder and other illegal activities that put Kate in danger. If you're a fan, you know how dogged Kate is! She will not quit until she figures out what's going on. The tension increases as the story progresses and reaches the conclusion.This is a great addition to the series.

Among The Wicked is the eighth book and there are three novellas. It is as strong as the first in the series! Ms. Castillo\u2019s writing style pulls me in and keeps me reading as Kate suffers the trials and tribulations of solving another crime involving the Amish. The climax had me stunned with a great plot twist!Police Chief Kate Burkholder is asked to go on leave in Painters Mill, OH and go undercover as a plain widow in an Amish community in upstate New York to discover what happened to a young Amish girl found frozen to death and the possible abuse of children. As Kate becomes familiar with the Amish of this community, she is puzzled by the extreme reverence and/or real fear of the families towards their Bishop. She becomes aware of disappearances, physical punishments and strange youth counselling by or with the blessing of Bishop Schrock which would never happen in any other Amish community.Kate\u2019s questions not only focus on the possible crimes in the community, but are self-directed as well. She and BCI Agent Frank Tomasetti\u2019s personal lives are moving along well, but she misses the sense of community the Amish women experience. She has to deal with her feelings about her Amish roots, which need to be made without blinders to keep herself safe and alive in the present.

I finished at midnight last night, unable to stop reading. It is book 8 in the series, but worked ok for me as a stand alone. Kate Burkholder grew up in an Amish community, but left as a teenager, earned a GED, and got a part time job answering the phone at a police substation. She went to community college at night and got a 2 year degree in criminal justice. She has worked her way up to homicide detective in the Columbus PD , when she is offered the job of chief in her hometown, because of her Amish background. In this book, she is asked by NY state police to go undercover and find out why a 15 year old girl turned up dead in an Amish community. She agrees and early on the bad guys are revealed, although there is a twist at the end that I didn't expect.

In Among the Wicked, the eighth of the series, Castillo skirts that issue when Chief Burkholder agrees to go undercover in upstate New York to investigate the suspicious death of a teenage Amish girl. Local law enforcement personnel have been unable to make any headway in the case due to the suspicions fostered by the strict bishop who takes a hard line on Amish-English relationships.Fearing for her safety, Kate\u2019s lover BCI Agent John Tomasetti argues against her accepting the case. But Kate is a dedicated officer with a strong commitment to finding answers to end a threatening situation, even at risk to her own life. As a fellow lawman, Tomasetti understands this; as a loving partner, he is scared. Truthfully, so is Kate, but she forges ahead. It\u2019s been eighteen years since she donned Amish garb and lived the plain life. How will she feel? Can she pull it off without tipping her hand?Taking the name of Kate Miller, she quickly meets members of the Amish community. She finds some of them to be warm and welcoming \u2013 to a point. There are some things they refuse to discuss, such as the death of Rachel Esh or their concerns about the bishop, Eli Shrock. Will Kate eventually manage to find anyone who will confide in her about the girl\u2019s death? What about Bishop Shrock? There are those who seem in awe of him \u2013 or is it fear? Others are openly disdainful, but they are few. Can Kate get them to talk? Or will Tomasetti\u2019s concerns be realized? Although she is posing as a childless widowed Amish woman, Kate is not entirely off the grid. She has a cell phone, which she is able to charge in her rustic rental trailer. She also has a couple of handguns. She checks in daily with local sheriff, Dan Suggs and New York BCI senior investigator Frank Betancourt. Other than that, though, she\u2019s on her own. Having never gone undercover, she must rely on her experience as a former Amish person, and on her investigative training and her instincts.Kate has several late night forays into the woods to the site where Rachel\u2019s body was found and to Shrock\u2019s property, where she learns some surprising things. Will these discoveries come back to haunt her? Upstate New York in the winter is cold, snowy, and unfriendly. I love when the setting plays a role in the story, and this is something that Castillo does well. Not all of Kate\u2019s discoveries are bad, however. Among the women of the sewing circle \u2013 which made me chuckle because Kate cannot sew \u2013 she finds community and friendship that she hadn\u2019t even realized she was missing. It brought me back to my high school and college years when I was involved in church groups. The women kindly overlook her sewing shortcomings and even seem to forgive her overt curiosity and tend to be gossipy and neighborly.Back to the question about danger \u2013 in each of the Burkholder novels so far, Kate has managed to get herself in and out of jams. So it came as no surprise to me when her poking and prodding got her into more than one fix. There is one whopper of a twist, however, that I didn\u2019t see coming, making Among the Wicked perhaps one of my favorite Burkholder novels yet.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Doug Bradshaw", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/808994-doug-bradshaw", "userReview": "This was my first Kate Burkholder story, her 8th. I breezed through it fairly quickly and I enjoyed it. There is a certain coziness to her writing, Kate's relationship to her boyfriend, her everyday comments about the world and how things work, all done in a way that draws you into her world, like a long time friend that you know and can trust.Having grown up as Amish and as an experienced police officer, she is the prefect choice to go into an Amish village undercover, to see what is going on. I enjoyed the way she insinuates herself into the lives of the locals, how vulnerable she becomes without transportation or easy access to help, while living in an old smelly mobile home. But as the title indicates, there is wickedness in this little community and it takes some pretty brave heroics on her part to stick her neck out to solve the riddle of missing people, pregnant young girls and death.I'd go to 4 stars except that I felt that some of the story was a little too formulaic and sometimes put together a little too quickly. But I'd read another of her books if I were book-less in Mexico on vacation and it was for sale in the sundry shop. I'd compare it to watching an NCIS episode on TV.

Among the Wicked #8, her latest novel, is compulsively readable as Chief of Police Officer Kate Burkholder goes undercover to sniff out the rotten doings in a secluded Amish community far from her home in Painters Mill. Always, Castillo's novels retain immense respect for the faith and culture of the Amish while addressing the human frailties which either create susceptibilities or dark traits, to criminal acts. In the midst of a situation where fear and victimization seem rampant, Kate Burkholder realizes the essential goodness of these hardworking people, who have been taken advantage of by a powerful nefarious character. Among the Wicked gets top marks for being highly suspenseful. The driving sense of purpose - to right a wrong- to aid the Amish who fold in upon themselves in crisis and push police out- made this story even more compelling. Castillo is masterful with the genre of literary suspense.

They're emotionally intense, sometimes disturbing stories. And, in each one, we get to know Kate a little more. The latest book, Among the Wicked, takes her into her own emotions by putting her in a role she never expected to be in again, that of an Amish woman.For four years, Kate Burkholder has been police chief of Painters Mill, Ohio, a small community of 5,300, half of whom are Amish. She herself was from an Amish family, but she left when she was eighteen. It was a struggle to survive, earn her GED, work and go to school, but she eventually returned to a community that appreciated her ability to communicate with the Amish. Now, someone else is calling on that skill. There are rumors about the new bishop in an Amish settlement in upstate New York. A young girl was found frozen to death, and there are rumors of abuse and violence. Kate is asked to go undercover. She's the only cop the New York State Bureau of Investigation could find that is fluent in Pennsylvania Dutch. When kids are at risk, Kate is willing to take a difficult job, despite the feelings of her lover, Tomasetti, an agent with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.Kate quickly learns how difficult it is to go undercover with no immediate back-up in a location where she knows no one. She doesn't trust the bishop; others don't trust her. She finds herself in a dangerous, threatening environment, one she didn't expect in the Amish community. But, when she finds her way to a quilting shop, she finds emotions she didn't know she still felt. \"I don't know if it's the part of me that's still Amish - that will always be Amish, or nostalgia, but for the first time since arriving in Roaring Springs, I'm relaxed. I like these women. I'm comfortable with them. And it occurs to me how good it feels to belong. How easy it would be to slip back into the rhythm of the old ways.\" Later, she says, \"I re-entered a life I thought I'd left behind forever.\"I have to admit I missed Kate Burkholder's team in Painters Mill. She really is on her own in New York, but she's a resourceful, strong woman. In every book, readers learn more about Burkholder, and she learns more about herself. She admits she's flawed, \"not always a prudent person, particularly when it comes to my job.\" She likes to win, no holds barred. She's driven. She tries too hard. And, when she realizes that Tomasetti loves her despite her flaws, she's able to reach out, and the couple, a believable pair, both with flaws, reaches a new comfort in their relationship. This self-awareness makes Kate Burkholder a complex, intriguing character.Linda Castillo's Kate Burkholder novels are must-reads for me. They're intense, meaty stories that deal with a fascinating culture. The stories are compelling and fast-paced. But, it's that flawed character, Kate Burkholder, who continues to draw me back. And, Among the Wicked is another excellent book in an outstanding series."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Among the Wicked by Linda Castillo is a 2016 Minotaur publication. I\u2019ve read several of Linda Castillo\u2019s novels back in the day, but I haven\u2019t read any books from this series. I noticed several of my Goodreads friends reading this one a few weeks back and decided to check it out. Now, I have yet another series I have to play catch up with, but for those who have not read the previous installments, I\u2019m thinking you can just jump in anywhere along the way, because this one read just fine as a stand alone. Kate takes a break from her chief of police duties to do an undercover job when a young Amish girl is found dead under suspicious circumstances. With Kate\u2019s past association with the Amish, she\u2019s the perfect person to worm her way into this particular sect, which is more close mouthed than usual. But, her mission proves much more dangerous than she ever could have imagined. The Amish community appears to be a lot more complicated than one might think, but they can also find themselves susceptible to being taken advantage of. I\u2019m not an expert on the Amish, but I did find this setup very interesting. The suspense was pretty tense and the author wastes no time in putting Kate in a dangerous spot, which kept me on edge at all times. At first glance, it would seem the mystery is pretty straightforward, and the obvious suspect does not disappoint, being quite sinister and scary, but the plot is more complex that it appears on the surface and there are a few eyebrow raising twists I never saw coming, which clinched the deal for me. I\u2019m a fan from now on and will definitely go back and read the previous books in the series. Overall, I was pretty impressed with this one and recommend it to fans of the series, for sure, but to anyone who enjoys a good novel of suspense.4 stars"}, {"userName": "Susan Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172713-susan-johnson", "userReview": "One of my favorite things about this series is learning about the Amish culture. Police Chief Kate Burkholder was raised Amish before she left the community. In this book she is approached by New York police to go undercover in an Amish community in northern New York, 20 miles from the Canadian border. A teenager turns up dead and there is concern for the children in the group. Kate is uniquely qualified with her knowledge of the language and culture so she accepts the assignment. The group has a new charismatic Bishop who adheres to the strict rules of the religion. Whispers have been heard of people being punished for not following the rules. Is it an Amish community or a cult? As Kate settles in her undercover role, she finds things even more disturbing than previously thought.

Rachel was Amish and the community she hails from has closed ranks around their Bishop, that believes in the old ways. They need Kate to go undercover into the Amish community and get some answers to what happened to Rachel.Kate is the only one in law enforcement that is fluent in the language and can blend in with Amish. She borrows clothes from her sister and sets up a story for herself. As she meets the women in the community she senses that they are keeping a dangerous secret...that might be worse than just murder. As Kate starts to ask questions she is warned to back off or people will be hurt. How can Kate abandon her assignment when rumours of children being harmed and members disappearing is ongoing? But can she help those in trouble before she is silenced?Linda Castillo has not written a bad novel in the Kate Burkholder series. I have rated them all as four-stars and enjoyed each full-length book. (My only concern with the novellas is that they are not long enough.) This book has less of her team and John Tomasetti in it, but I did like that we got to see Kate in another environment. Kate had to act the part of being Amish at every moment she was with someone. It was interesting to see what parts of being Amish she misses and what parts she is happy to have shed. Her relating to the Amish Community was also a different part to her. The previous books had her relating to the Amish as an outsider, former-Amish and a police officer. The crime(s) in this book were really terrifying and I have to say the suspense was crazy that I stayed up to finish the book.

I hate doing negative reviews, especially for an author I had previously liked. I gave Down a Dark Road 5 stars and I was looking forward to reading this book, Among the Wicked. I was horribly disappointed.If you know Kate Burkholder, she was raised Amish but left when she turned 18. I'm not sure how old she is now but she is definitely no sweet, young thing. She is asked to go undercover as an Amish widow in an Amish community that has not so nice things going on. After being an English for as long as she has, the idea of her passing as an Amish widow, without arousing suspicion, is ludicrous.She goes around poking into everything and asking all sorts of questions and no one 'suspects\"The evil Bishop is a caricature and totally unbelievable. He has sex with young girls, has people beat up and killed and no one fights back. They even throw in sex slave trafficking. The whole book is a terrible farce. I know I am going against the many positive reviews. It might be because I have only read one other book by Linda Castillo and this one, for me, paled in comparison.I received this book from Minotaur in exchange for an honest review.Review posted on Goodreads and Amazon 8/04/2017"}, {"userName": "AH", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255548-ah", "userReview": "This was my first foray into the Kate Burkholder world and I am sure that I will find the time to go back and read the previous books. I have never really read any kind of books about the Amish, so that aspect really intrigued me and kept my interest. I also loved that the book took place not far from where I live in areas that I may visit, which adds a touch of realism to a book of fiction.First off, don\u2019t let the fact that this is book 8 in a series put you off \u2013 especially you OCD types out there who absolutely must read books in order. Among the Wicked can be easily read as a standalone book without any loss of critical information. Actually, the fact that it was part of a series made me happy that I now have something to get back to at a later date.I was quite fascinated with the Amish side of things. I\u2019ve always wondered about their community and while this book does not purport to be a guide to the Amish, it did describe their simple way of life quite effectively. I loved the fact that Kate was raised Amish herself, but that she chose to life away from their community. I enjoyed how Kate was able to insert herself into the community and how she gained the trust of the women around her.This book kept me glued to my seat. I think I devoured it over the course of 2 days. And what an unexpected twist \u2013 I never saw that coming.My only criticism is that Kate spent a lot of time out in the cold walking, riding a scooter, and sometimes even without the requisite amount of warm clothing and foot covering. Winters can be bitterly cold and it amazed me that she never suffered from frostbite.Fantastic Read. Highly recommended.Review posted on Badass Book Reviews. Check it out!Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for a review copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1418580-wendy", "userReview": "Loved this 8th book in the Kate Burkholder series!!"}, {"userName": "KC", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7582369-kc", "userReview": "Thank you NetGalley and Minotaur Books for the advanced digital copy for my honest review. This was one of my favorite Chief Kate Burkholder stories yet.

Terrific story!"}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "This was my first introduction to this author and to Chief of Police Kate Burkholder. Because of her earlier Amish upbringing, Kate is called upon by the sheriff\u2019s department in rural upstate, New York to help investigate the death of a young Amish girl and the Amish community. As she goes undercover as an Amish woman it brings back so many of the ways of life Kate thought she had left behind. Her lover State Agent John Tomasetti is not thrilled that Kate will be only on limited communication and back up should danger arrive. But Kate is determined, more so given the accounts of children in danger that have surfaced. The reader suspects that Kate will end up in danger too as she starts to investigate. Her cover as a widowed Amish woman may be well be her undoing and put her in harm\u2019s way.Though I hadn\u2019t read any previous novels about this character, did not matter a bit. I quickly warmed to Kate and got the gist of her background, current relationship and strength of character. This is a gripping novel about a complex, three dimensional character. I liked Kate and also the Amish setting. I liked the relationship that is shown between the Amish women and the contrast between gossip and those who for various reasons are afraid to talk. At times I was turning over the pages in anticipation of would come next. Needless to say, all is not quite as it should be. I don\u2019t read a lot of crime novels but I enjoyed this one. I liked the way the story unfolded, revealing that some people are not always as they first seem. Littered a bit with use of the f word, this is still an engrossing read that had me on the edge of my seat much of the time."}, {"userName": "Karyn Niedert", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11768919-karyn-niedert", "userReview": "I love Linda Castillo's writing style, and when the opportunity to read her latest bool, \"Among the Wicked\" arose I jumped at it.Castillo's heroine, Chief Kate Burkholder, has been asked to go undercover in upstate New York to infiltrate a small Amish community and make sure there are no nefarious goings on. Interest in the small community has formed after a young girl was found dead, presumably frozen to death, at a nearby lake after a snowstorm. There is concern that other children in the small community may be in danger, and that the charismatic leader of the village, Bishop Schrock, may be doling out punishments severe enough to lead to death.Chief Burkholder, as a fallen away Amish, is absolutely perfect to go into their community as an newly widowed woman seeking a strict order to worship in. I enjoyed thinking through what preparations she would have to account for and learn as she followed through on the mission.One warning, as I was reading the story, my common sense screamed that Kate was asking too many questions, too soon, and making too many rounds of meeting the Amish folks so quickly. Kate mentions \"poking a beehive\" several times, and it seems more like she's whacking one with a baseball bat. I understand that she was undercover for a limited amount of time and needed to make headway in the case as quickly as possible, but it was uncomfortable reading some parts when she was behaving like a bull in a China shop.Castillo delivers several delicious plot twists and manages to move Kate and Tomasetti's relationship forward without it going stale on readers. \"Among the Wicked\" will be on bookseller shelves on July 12, 2016 and I highly recommend picking it up to enjoy as a twisty summer read."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "This is book eight in this series. I have yet to find a book in this series that I have been disappointed about. I really like the Amish aspect of this series. Then there is Kate. She is a strong female lead. She always bring something good to the table. I feel like I get to see another layer of just who Kate is every time that she visits the Amish community. Although this is just part of the reason why I like these books. The other reason is because the storyline is complex. In the beginning I may not always have a clear picture of who is the prime suspect but when I do find out it is not again always in the middle of the story either. So I am glad to have this mystery kept for a while. Always a good ending. Just like the other books, this one is a quick read. I can not wait to read the next one."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "I've read most of the books in this series. They are either 3 or 4 stars for me, and so was this one. The premise in the beginning was definitely intriguing. I thought the possibilities were endless with that story line. I wasn't disappointed there. The author ran with it. Some of this seemed highly out of the realm of plausibility, but I still enjoyed it. The pace moved at a fair clip with all the different things going on. I also like the MC. She is strong, competent, and yet flawed. It all works well together. I think this is one of my favorites in this series so far because I was completely pulled into the story line.
