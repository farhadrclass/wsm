The chapter headings 001.00, etc were a distraction that took me several chapters to even realize what the numbers meant. The descriptions are ugly.I didn't make any connection to Lia and never grew to like her. As written, her character seemed like a spoiled rich brat who was not even kind enough to pick up the phone to speak to the parents of her dead best friend, even when the girl's mother is begging her.She is willing to run off with a young man that she barely knows or likes in order to not have to face the consequences of what she's done to herself. She uses him to get what she wants/needs without giving him even a tiny bit of honesty until she is forced to do so. None of the things she does make me understand her or like her. I simply never grew to care whether or not she got well and had this book been successful for me, I should have cared. Lia makes reference to the fact that she knows she is starving herself so she isn't acting out of unawareness or confusion, she simply doesn't care if she's hurting herself or her family or anyone. Her attitude toward her parents is heartless and cold, although all they try to do throughout the entire book is help her. She blames them for her illness and doesn't ever seem to take responsibility for it on herself. A quote from the end of the book: \"The tiny elf dancer became a wooden doll whose strings were jerked by people not paying attention.\"That seems to say that she still isn't responisible for what she did to herself, if they'd been paying more attention to her, instead of trying to get her to be what they wanted or pursuing their careers, she wouldn't have gotten sick, in her opinion. I'm sure there are many better books about anorexia. This reads like a manual on how to be anorexic. For me this one is a don't bother to read it.NOTE: For anyone who wants to rip into me and tell me that I don't know anything about eating disorders. Well, you don't know me and you don't know what I do or do not know about eating disorders. You don't know what personal experience I might or might not have. So I'd appreciate it, if that's your only intent, if you didn't leave a comment telling me what a bad person I am for not liking a fictional story. My review of a BOOK is not intended to put down or de-value anyone. A careful reading of the review would make it clear that I did not care for the way the author chose to portray this character, not that I was putting her down for having an eating disorder. Let me say that again. If Lia was an alcoholic, chocoholic, shopaholic, drug addict, sex addict, hoarder, snowboarder, prom queen, cheerleader or any other kind of character, I still would NOT have enjoyed the way the story and charcter was presented. I hope that's clear. This isn't an autobiography or Lia's real-life memoirs. It's made up, a story, fiction, not true. There are characters in many books that, for whatever reason, are not likeable. For me, personally, Lia is one of them. Any further comments that are merely tearing into me about what I do or not know, any personal attacks, are not productive. Name calling and hurling insults isn't adding anything to the discussion. If you want to discuss the book, I'll gladly do that.

This book was a really emotional read for me. It's been recommended to me a million times over and I'm so glad I finally picked it up.The writing in this book was incredible. Everything flowed together perfectly and it was more like reading a masterpiece than just reading a book. I'm extremely impressed with the way the author was able to capture all of Lia's experiences with the perfect words, words that fit together so flawlessly it's impossible for them to be described any other way.The portrayal of eating disorders in this book is also PHENOMENAL. I'm truly amazed this isn't an own voices novel with how accurately the author was able to capture the experience of suffering from such a life-altering disorder. Lia's voice is the voice of an anorexic to a \"t\"; The anger, the bitterness, the resentment, the cold-hearted carelessness was so true, it's almost frightening. \"I want to eat like a normal person eats, but I need to see my bones or I will hate myself even more and I might cut out my heart or take every pill that was ever made.\"This is the reality I struggle to live with every single day and I am so grateful someone was able to capture it so precisely. I'm also so thankful this book showed the truly horrifying reality of eating disorders; This is a fatal illness. There are a ton of fictitious works with eating disorders out there, but I don't believe I know of one that incorporates the real consequences of this disorder. Cassie's death, especially the cause, was a crucial part of not only the plot of this story, but why I feel this is such an important read. There's absolutely NO glorification of this illness, and this novel did a fantastic job at showing how dangerous it can be. I can't stress enough how wonderful this representation of EDs was to me and how grateful I am this book exists.The only issue I have with this book is a personal one, and that is how many flashbacks were included. In the beginning of the book, I felt every 5 or so pages I was reading another flashback, which is a bit excessive for my reading tastes. I understand flashbacks are sometimes necessary to fully tell a story, as they are in this novel as well. I just personally prefer novels more focused in the present, and I felt the first half of the book relied very heavily on flashbacks I wasn't too keen on reading.Luckily, the book really picked up for me in the second half. We shy away from the past and move into the approaching end to the story, which was really amazing. This is where we truly see the raw emotion and authenticity of Lia's character & how her illness really affects her. The second half of this book is where I feel it really flourishes and develops into the extremely powerful novel that it is. If it has one final flaw, the ending felt slightly abrupt and I would have loved to see how things progresses from where we end, but I understand the significance of the point the book ended at, so either way, I'm satisfied.Overall, I really loved this book. I seriously felt identified and really saw myself in Lia, which I am inherently grateful for. I do agree with the endless trigger warnings placed on this novel because like many great mental health novels, the content is so authentic, it may be more harmful than helpful. But if you are in a healthy mindset and looking to either learn more about eating disorders or relate to a book based off of your own experiences, Wintergirls is at the top of my recommendations list."}, {"userName": "Karin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72729-karin", "userReview": "Lia fights a war every day.

Two stays in a treatment facility hasn\u2019t cured her; it just forced her to develop techniques to survive in a world of food.

As it turns out, this is exactly right - Lia's sense of self was damaged even before her former best friend Cassie died alone and in pain. Their partnership was a deathly one; both girls aspired to be the skinniest as they struggled to grasp their way into adolescence, both traumatized by events from the past. Lia's choice was starvation. Cassie's was purging. Now that Lia is left to pursue the goal alone, ghosts rise up unbidden and voices haunt her days and nights. The loudest and most horrific is, of course, Cassie reminding her that they have a pact and that she is waiting for Lia between the veil of this world and the next.Anderson does an incredible job of portraying mental illness and eating disorders, opening a door for readers into the inner hell of sufferers."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "ariel says everyone loves this book, and that's probably true, these girls today are probably super-drawn to this kind of story. it's not bad, i just already have a favorite teen-problem-novel about anorexia, one that doesn't have the voice of this narrator, who was so immersed in her dreamworld, she frequently spoke in this forced-poetic voice that i found distracting: \"used to be that my whole body was my canvas - hot cuts lick my ribs, ladder rungs climbing my arms, thick milkweed stalks shooting up my thighs. when i moved to jenniferland, my father made one condition. a daughter who forgets how to eat, well that was bad, but it was just a phase and i was over it. but a daughter who opens her own skin bag, wanting to let her shell fall to the ground so she can dance? that was just sick.\"\"my hands read a braille map hewn from bone, starting with my hollow breasts threaded with blue-vein rivers thick with ice. i count my ribs like rosary beads, muttering incantations, fingers curling under the bony cage. they can almost touch what's hiding inside.\"for me, that voice gets old pretty quick. and the constant crossouts (not pictured); it stands out and makes the layout eye-catching, but not in a positive way, to my elderly eye.i honestly don't understand anorexia. me, i have no discipline. i lack the amount of self-control it takes to not eat the entire pint of ice cream. and even with all of the political/social pressure, i lack the interest/willpower to stop eating fuzzy baby animals. so the rigorous scrutiny of everything that passes the lips of the anorectic, the obsessing and calorie-memorizing and constant vigilance. shit, i'm in grad school, i don't need anything else to think about, for reals. why can't these girls channel this energy into something awesome, like painting or science and bridge-building? i know it is more complicated than all that, but it just seems exhausting and more trouble than it is worth. this put a nice twist on the teenorexia novel; the way it takes it a step further and really plays upon the character's perceived culpability in the death of her best friend, which is of course a factor in her own illness, but is also a whole other potential novel. so i liked the layering of two different enmeshed problems - i appreciated its ambition, but ultimately i prefer my old tried and true book from my junior high \"be aware fair\". i want to like her books so much, and there are still three i plan to read, but so far, the two i have read have seemed like books teen girls would really respond to, but i just can't get into. but greg - sheesh - speak is like his all time favorite. he is such a girl. but not a little gollum-girl:"}, {"userName": "Anne ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23304719-anne", "userReview": "I ship this book.

She looks at food and all she sees are numbers. Calories and numbers, numbers and calories. Counting and starving are two of the things she shares with her best friend, together they're the Wintergirls. But Lia's better, better at counting, and so much better at starving. The story opens with her best friend's sudden death which leaves Lia shackled alone, and lost in the gravity of a disease they once shared.And so Lia tries to find her way.\nMY THOUGHTS\nKnowing me, you had to know this was coming.MY REACTION AFTER READING THE BLURB IN FACTSo we're almost 30 pages into the book when this conversation takes place.Appetite: I seriously don't get it. Me: I don't get it tooAppetite: You know it's stupidMe: Very.Appetite: What are we having for dinner?Me: Everything.We both know the only time I become anorexic is after I've eaten to my gluttonous content and then eaten some more just to convince myself that I shouldn't eat some more. But we don't quit. We don't quit because we do want to get it.About 50 pages later, I can't help it, I get so frustrated with Lia and I just have to say itAND THEN I ASK I'm almost ready to give up when it happens, almost 200 pages into the book, I believe. Somehow my appetite falls along the way or maybe I do(the deafened part of me). And finally:\u25b6 I don't empathize \u25b6 I don't sympathize.\u25b6 I don't even try to justify. \u25b6 I just believe.\n Lia made me see and believe in the gravity of her disorder.\n I believe in the power of lack of will power and in the debilitating, unrelenting voices which threaten to drown out everything else, poisoning and weakening your resolve as they echo and bounce around in your head.  I believe in the surprising and occasional comfort the ground offers, deceiving you into never finding your feet and rising up again. That's just it, Lia made me believe in her story. And finally I found myself yelling: You can do it! You can do it, Lia. You can. Don't listen to those voices saying you can't. Don't let them eat you up. Don't let them take what's left of you.Lia just grew so much. So freaking much. Funny thing is while I was reading, I couldn't see it, I didn't notice the little shifts, the little shaky steps she took towards becoming free. I guess it's this thing where we always expect to see the change when it happens, for it to be some great defining moment - something we can pinpoint and link a memory to. But it wasn't so, and It isn't always so. It's possible people won't get this book the way I do, not everyone will understand Lia. I didn't, not at first. Actually not at all. But the truth of her story, the moral of it, is such an urgent and imparting one . The topic of anorexia is not something I really thought I'd ever read about. Coupled with loss, honestly it's not something to pick up lightly. But I loved this story all the more for it's dark and somber quality. I'll believe anyone who says the writing isn't spectacular or magnificent, or in contrasting view, may be it's overly poetic. I'll concur and go right ahead and nod if someone said parts of this book were annoying and the plot twist wasn't hair-raising and jaw-dropping enough. But I'll answer right back and say: This isn't meant to entertain you, it's meant to bring you right back down to earth, and remind you that there are some things that are beyond our understanding. And that's okay. But the thing is to listen . Even if that's the only thing you can do, listen and not judge what you can't understand.\u26ab \n\nQUOTES I ABSOLUTELY LOVED\n\n\n\u25b6 There is no magic cure, no making it all go away forever.

Amazon seems to have eaten my review (maybe it will be posted in a couple days?). I decided to look for more dissenting opinions on here.4 or 5 stars for great writing. Anderson creates a page turner and certainly has an admirable command of language.2 stars for depth.Most articles and even many books about eating disorders focus on the horror! and the drama! and the hospitalizations! and the emaciation! of it all, making diseases like anorexia sound like sickly appealing bids for popularity. Anderson goes a little beyond that, but not far.I can't really say that anything in this book is _wrong_. The obsessive thoughts and messages running through Lia's head are dead-on. Her behaviors are textbook, and the degradation of her body is sadly a reality for many. We sense that something is not quite right in Lia's world, but Anderson never gives us enough information to speculate as to what's fueling the obsession. We see that Lia is grieving, we see that she hates her family, we see that her self esteem is cripplingly low - but there's not much more to her than that. The reader is likely to interpret her feelings as little more than ordinary teenage angst - when eating disorders are much more than that.I hesitate to write this, because there is no one-size-fits-all description of someone with anorexia or bulimia. But I do wonder at the stereotypes Anderson chooses to embrace and reject. Here's what we know about Cassie: she's an over-extended people-pleaser very involved in her community, but she has low self esteem. All of that sounds like textbook bulimia. Lia, on the other hand, is rich, unhappy, and the daughter of divorced parents. That's about all we know about her outside of her obsession with food and weight-loss. I seriously reject the notion that only rich girls develop anorexia. A stereotype that is commonly true of anorectics, though, is that they are perfectionists, and many are overachievers. Lia is none of these things - and although those aren't requirements for anorexia, Anderson doesn't give us anything else to go on. Lia doesn't care about her grades, doesn't care about pissing people off, doesn't want to go to college, doesn't really do anything or hold any aspirations other than her next goal weight. And while eating disorders commonly do reach this life-consuming point, we never get a glimpse of what Lia is aside from a series of behaviors and pounds lost. To her credit, Anderson includes a paragraph or two describing anxiety. I respect her hesitation to avoid spelling out the lesson to be learned or gift-wrapping the text. But as a writer, Anderson fails to dig. The novel is more like a circus - strange and fascinating to watch, but several steps short of revealing.To be fair, the novel _is_ accurate. It just isn't enough. I am really amazed by reviewers who say, \"Wow, now I understand anorexia!\" when Anderson describes only the obsessive thoughts in Lia's head (of course we have no idea why or how they got there) and the way she behaved in response to those thoughts. Readers, whether they know much or little about eating disorders, won't walk away having gained more insight than an article on Lindsay Lohan would give them.Anderson notes that she interviewed clinicians and visited pro anorexia websites during her research. I just don't feel that that was sufficient. People who are pro eating disorders are sure to love this book the way they love Wasted, but unlike Wasted, we see only the train wreck - without insight.P.S. If I am going to nitpick insignificant details, here they are:1) The police scene is not believable. You can access your voice mail from any phone. So they for sure would have investigated the messages further.2) The car running out of gas (Lia of course drove it on empty for many miles) is too much of a forced, obvious metaphor for me, and Anderson seems a little too proud of this contrived feat.3) The relationships are stiff. Not stiff the way a real relationship can be, but stiff the way they are written.For real, Anderson is a gifted writer. But I think there is more to great literature than a captivating narrative."}, {"userName": "Zo\u00eb", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9303625-zo", "userReview": "WOW.

I have no clue how to begin. I don\u2019t think I ever read a book that left me so lost, for lack of a better word. I\u2019m numb and astonished and a heap of other feelings I can\u2019t even try to begin to explain. I felt physically uncomfortable while reading it and I felt so so sad throughout it. Just, simply put, an overwhelming feeling of sadness and helplessness was always with me. It\u2019s that need you feel as a reader to shield the characters you read about and to save them, but you realize there isn\u2019t anything you can do, but read on.Wintergirls tells the story of Lia, a high school senior who struggles with anorexia. Her best friend, Cassie, who suffers from bulimia, dies and the night that happens, she calls Lia 33 times, but Lia doesn\u2019t pick up. As the story progresses, things get worse and worse for her - she feels guilty for Cassie\u2019s death, she is haunted by the demons in her head, by the demons of her illness, and she unravels. One thing that is very important is that this book does not glamorize eating disorders. They are shown with all the ugliness they have - and trust me, there is so, so much ugliness in them, and it shows that they are not a whim, they are not a trend, they are an illness and, like with many illnesses, they take over your life and you lose yourself in them. I saw Lia struggle so much, and I felt for her and for her family. It\u2019s frightening to see her shrink more and more with every page, see her lie to everyone around her, see her not want to get better, because she hates herself. Food is the enemy, it is pain, she sees herself as \u201cstupid/ugly/stupid/bitch/stupid/fat/ stupid/baby/stupid/loser/stupid/lost\u201d. She feels undeserving, she feels guilty for Cassie\u2019s death, she feels alone, misunderstood, and\u2026lost. She has so much pain cooped up inside, that she resorts to self harm in order to feel\u2026something, to let the pain out. The people around her, although they want to help, at one point, they\u2019d just rather ignore what\u2019s in front of them and pretend that things are okay, instead of pushing harder and get Lia the help that she so desperately needs.This book scared me so much. It\u2019s such a raw, unfiltered look into the world of eating disorders. It\u2019s a huge wake up call to anyone who might think it\u2019s a good idea to try something like that and it doesn\u2019t shy away from anything. I was hovering on the edge of anorexia back in high school, although I didn\u2019t know that back then. I exercised a lot, I ate less and less and I saw myself as fat, even though I weighed about 100 lbs (45 kg) at a height of 5\u20326\u2033 (168 cm). Thankfully, I woke up and never jumped that line. But reading this, it made me think - where would I be now if I didn\u2019t have that wake up call? Exceptionally well researched and written, it\u2019s one of Anderson\u2019s best works. It flows beautifully, it\u2019s haunting, moving and powerful. It may save a life.

It didn't help that I'm literally FREEZING right now (it's winter! I'm cold!) and this book was...it was like reading about a self-destructing snowflake. I always find it intense and confronting to read about eating disorders. I put off this book forever, but I really loved Laurie Halse Anderson's The Impossible Knife of Memory and I knew I needed to read more of her masterpieces. SO I WAS BRAVE. I READ THIS. It definitely affected me. This book is dangerous and beautiful. It's written ridiculously well. Like, the writing lingers in that area between metaphor and reality. And the wording?! OMG HOW IS IT LEGAL TO WRITE THIS WELL.We held hands when we walked down the gingerbread path into the forest, blood dripping from our fingers. We danced with witches and kissed monsters. We turned us into wintergirls, when she tried to leave, I pulled her back into the snow because I was afraid to be alone.Is that not ridiculously beautiful?The topic is tough, obviously, but the author handled it so so well. I was caught between fury and crying half the time. I do NOT think Lia's family supported her. I do NOT think they were helping her emotionally. They saw numbers on a scale, just like she did -- only she wanted them to go down, and they needed them to go up. Anorexia isn't just about food: it's emotional and mental, too. And I feel like Lia did not get the help there that she needed. She needed it from her family...and they let her down. So I found that very emotional to read, because Lia NEEDED someone to stand there telling her she was okay and she was loved. LEMME CRY UGLY UGLY TEARS. Gosh. I really don't know how to review this book. It is like 98% an emotional journey, so the actual things-that-happened are very sparse. There was a lot of purple prose. I thought it was beautiful, but there were times when it felt like a filler. The book made me uncomfortable...but it's supposed to. It doesn't stick a bandaid on at the end, but at the same time, there is a whiff of hope. So this book totally disturbed me and I'm just going to go burrow under my blankets and cry because this book is as beautiful as it is terrible."}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "This was my first read by Laurie Halse Anderson and I now see why people love her writing so much. She has a way of explaining inner thoughts in beautiful and heart-breaking words and phrases, and while the language is poetic it doesn't drown the actual story. \"Wintergirls\" deals with anorexia and bulemia all at once. It's a very strong and impactful story; especially, I would imagine, if you read it as a young adult which this novel is targeted towards. However, you can obviously still read it as an adult and be disturbed and impacted by it. It is an eye-opener when it comes to what anoxeria does to your body and your mind, because it is a scary and honest insight into the protagonist's Lia's thoughts on food and weight and everything body-related. I think this book was special because it was so raw, but also because of its language. Laurie Halse Anderson is a master at her craft, and as mentioned earlier I definitely agree with everyone who claims that she writes beautiful, yet haunting stories."}, {"userName": "Lisa Vegan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan", "userReview": "This book was absolutely mesmerizing! I was completely engrossed and I really enjoyed it. This book gets five stars and not four from me, despite a couple of flaws, because Lia seemed so real and the writing style was wonderful and the language was lovely.I\u2019d highly recommend this book to those treating and caring for those suffering from anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and certain types of mental illnesses. I think it would be very educational for some, and useful for those they\u2019re trying to help.I\u2019d be reluctant to suggest it to young people who suffer from anorexia, bulimia, or severe depression because, as with just about every single book about these subjects, it could be a harmful trigger. It\u2019s not that the book glorifies these ailments, but the graphic descriptions of coping methods could set some off on a dangerous and self-destructive path. Then again, I\u2019m sure this book will appeal to sufferers and it has the potential to actually help them, especially if the book is discussed.As when reading all books about anorexia nervosa, or people starving for whatever reason, reading this made me want to eat! Too much!I cared about Lia and also her step-sister Emma, and I very much enjoyed the numerous references to other young adult and children\u2019s books & authors. The fact that Lia is a reader is impressive. I read a paperback advanced uncorrected reader copy. There were lots of strike thrus and other copy that made me unsure what the final book will be. Pages 224-225 were completely blank with no text. The novel in this form was 278 pages, 282 pages with the acknowledgments.One \u201cerror\u201d drove me nuts. Lia (the main character) and her best friend Cassie and also Lia and a friend Elijah play the Hearts card game, apparently with a deck of cards and not on a computer, but you need a minimum of three players, not just two, in order to play Hearts. (I did message the person who provided the ARC to me about that, and also about one of the author\u2019s choices of wording that didn\u2019t ring true to me. Apparently, the final copy of the first edition of the book is printed, but she\u2019ll message the editor about my concerns, and if they agree with me it\u2019s possible changes will be made in future reprints.)I had very recently read this author\u2019s book Speak. (I had seen the movie years ago. The movie was good; the book is great.) Unlike Speak, which despite the serious subject matter was hilarious, this book was not filled with humor. There were a very few mildly amusing parts but it\u2019s a much darker novel than Speak. It really gets into the mind of an eighteen-year-old girl (told first person by her) suffering from anorexia nervosa and depression. The story is compelling, at times actually terrifying, and I did cry, but reading it was well worth the painful feelings I experienced."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "I did not finish this book. Why? It was hard, frustrating and very slow. This is a book about anorexia nervosa mainly. Lia, of what I know, was anorexic even before the death of her ex bestfriend Cassie. Again, I did not finish this book so maybe it was explained further in the story, I don't know. The thing is... Lia is not just anorexic. She hurts herself in otherways too and keeps having hallucinations. I know how this story ends though, since I read the last pages and it actually surprised me by not being a bad one. I get that this book may have a good/strong message to pass and I hope it makes people think and sensibelize them to anorexia nervosa because a lot don't know what it is or are scared of it. I did not finish this book, not because I did not like it, but because I could not stand how Lia hurted herself and lied to every single person she encountered. It frustrated me to a point that made me just want to close this book and throw it away (which I could not do since I borrowed it from a library) and pick a nice and enjoyable series (The Mortal Instruments or The Gallagher Girls perhaps). This is not me being in denial or something. The thing is I just learned today that I do not really like sad and frustrating books envolving real life problems, mental illness, death and characters I can not connect to all at once. It was just too much...It was not a bad book, just not for me."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "Wintergirls is a story about girl who's struggling with anorexia. It's a pretty quick read, but it didn't move me as much as I thought it would. The story is good. Scary and shocking with a strong message. I don't have a lot insight into the disease so this was a real eye opener for me; I wasn't aware how people with anorexia were able to actually self-discipline themselves to not eat. We're shown through Lia's point of view how she warps her world and relationships that which steers her into depression. It's not just about what she puts into her mouth, but how she perceives her compulsions and the empty void she lives in. It's really an astonishing story that overflows with emotions. However, I wish the characters were a bit more solid. We never really went into their reasons for thinking so negatively. What happened in their lives to get them to this point? In this aspect it felt like the author went very stereotypical teen angst. What really bugged me, though, while reading this book was the writing. It had a lot of analogies and metaphors that were just plain confusing at times. I sometimes didn't know what was real and what wasn't. It also took me a while to realize she was actually hallucinating and not just day dreaming or fantasizing. Additionally, the author uses a lot of different writing formats that were often annoying/distracting/disorienting ::distracting/disorienting/distracting/disorienting/::while not really adding anything to the story. All in all it wasn't anything overly special, though I still enjoyed the story. It had a lot of depth and was really thought provoking, but otherwise it fell flat, just a lil bit.--For more of my reviews, visit my blog at \nXpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "Wintergirls. What can I say about this book? It wasn't an easy read. I have never been exposed to the world of anorexia and bulimia and therefore can't say if it was truthfully and accurately portrayed, but what I can say is that being in Lia's mind definitely was a powerful experience which I will not soon forget. Although I couldn't understand what moved Lia to do certain things, I had a good look at her inner world which was a terrifying and bleak place. Her obsession with calories, not eating and weight loss, the lies, the guilt, the unhappiness, consumed her entire life where she couldn't relax even for a moment. I felt extremely sorry for her.My main concern with this book was the fact that I couldn't quite grasp why exactly Lia loathed herself so much. Yes, her parents divorced and were maybe too busy and neglectful. But was it enough to justify Lia's self-hate? I am not sure. And what exactly made Lia to finally decide to seek help? Maybe these things were explained in the book, but I guess way too subtly for my taste. I also have to note the writing style that was quite impressive, even though not easy to get used to. Final verdict? This is the book that everybody should read, even to just obtain some understanding of what's going on in the minds of people suffering from eating disorders."}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "Not quite as good as Speak but AHHHH STILL SO GOOD.

They called themselves the Wintergirls, the two were competitors in a deadly contest to see who can be the thinnest. But Lia had not spoken to Cassie in months after her trip into the hospital when her weight hit the danger zone. Now, Lia finds that Cassie has died alone in a motel and all Lia wants is answers to what happened. Lia had ignored Cassie's numerous phone calls and is now carrying guilt over the loss of her friend which starts a downward spiral of calorie counting and refusal to eat. To be honest I wasn't a huge fan of Wintergirls when I first started reading this one. I found the pace a bit slow while Lia was often a bit frantic and wasn't even sure I wanted to continue to read and finish the whole book. When done though I was glad I did as this one is a look into a territory that I was not at all familiar with and I think it does a good job showing what a girl like Lia is going through. Lia is an extremely flawed character. Not only is she anorexic but she is also into cutting herself and had never felt comfortable in her own skin. These may be problems that most cannot relate to but this fictional work seemed to give a realistic look into these problems that a lot of young girls do suffer from. If anything give this one a try just to get a look into a world that isn't easy to understand.Lia's story grew on me as it went on and I'd recommend checking this one out to anyone that is the least bit curious about this disease and what someone in Lia's position could possibly be thinking.

Speak is one of my all time favorite novels, so to say I was excited to read Wintergirls was an understatement. I was excited until I realized what Wintergirls was really about: anorexia. Was that something that I wanted to read about. It sounded truly depressing and slightly disturbing. But as hard as it was to read this novel, I felt like it was even harder to put down. Anderson continues to impress my with her beautifully written novels. I\u2019ve seen Anderson\u2019s writing described as lyrical and I have to say that I fully agree. And Wintergirls in no exception. Anderson\u2019s writing is almost hypnotizing, she has a way of explaining a situation thoroughly using as few words as possible. Genius. And it\u2019s so much more than writing, it\u2019s the characterization. Lia\u2019s character is so rawly displayed it\u2019s heartbreaking. I never fully understand the metal effects that an eating disorder can have, I marveled at a part of the text where Lia watches her dad eat.... and how she wishes she could eat like that. Aimlessly, automatic, effortless. For some reason that part really stuck out for me, and it was so simple. I\u2019m sure this novel will make an impact and be discussed, maybe even more so than Speak.

The set-up is standard: Lia is the caucasian, teenaged daughter of divorced parents. Much shock, much surprise. As the book opens, Lia is reeling from the loss of her estranged bestie, Cassie. Cassie, our token warning sign in human form, died suddenly after making repeated, unanswered calls to Lia. 33, in fact. Thankfully, that\u2019s where the cliches stop. Anderson goes on to deliver a stark, heart-wrenching account of Lia\u2019s decision to survive or succumb to this frequently misunderstood disorder. Laurie Halse Anderson is an undoubtedly beautiful writer. Her spare prose brilliantly captures Lia\u2019s internal warfare. Lia wants to eat, but her disease forbids it. Eating disorders are rarely about food. Food is simply the manifestation of a greater problem. Wintergirls  recognizes this issue and instead explores the reasons Lia starved behind. By attempting this feat, Anderson has created a nuanced portrait of a teenager locked in a life or death battle. But without the Danny Tanner, come-to-Jesus speech. THANK LOKI. To sum up: Highly recommended for teens interested in or struggling with an eating disorder. Or anyone because it's just....so. dang. good."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/719063-linda", "userReview": "Normally, I would have just left my two star (really, more like one and a half) rating and gone on my way. But Laurie Halse Anderson is very close to the top of the list of my favorite authors who write for teens, and this is the second title in the row of hers that I've given two stars.It kills me to think she might never write anything as good as Speak or Catalyst again.If I'm going to devote several hours of my life to follow a character through several hundred pages, I need something to hang my hat on. The heroine either needs to be likeable, hateable, or at the very least, needs to make me laugh.Lia did only one thing for me as a reader. You know the book Inkheart, where two characters have the ability to read themselves and others into the pages of a book? Well, Lia made me want to find someone with that ability, because I wanted to enter Wintergirls and strangle her with my bare hands. After she was dead, I'd do the kindest thing, and have her cremated, and I'd even take a mortar and pestle and grind the bits of bone left into powder, then scatter her ashes over a barren landscape where nothing could survive, and her remains wouldn't accidentally nourish anything in the ground, because that's as close as I could come to providing her heart's (seemingly only)desire-- to weigh absolutely nothing.I don't think the reader is supposed to like Lia. I'm not sure if the reader is supposed to identify with her-- I know I didn't. (I identified with her dad, when he finally lost it, and started screaming at her. I identified with her mom, who stopped just shy of tying Lia to a chair and pouring soup down her throat.) Is there a reason the reader is supposed to hope Lia survives? She had no interest in high school, boys, college. She hated her mom, hated her dad, hated her step-mom, hated her therapist, even hated her supposed best friend. (To her credit, she did tolerate her non-sister, but she also traumatized the girl.) We get no glimpse of the \"girl that could be\" without the illness.

That said, the main character is dissociated, so it's hard to feel particuarly close to her as a reader. But I think that's the point. I don't think it's an exaggeration at all to say that some readers will find salvation in this book, and for that alone, it deserves a dozen stars."}, {"userName": "Haley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22329447-haley", "userReview": "2016 Reading Challenge:\n A book with a blue coverOriginally read: 2010Reread: October 2014, March 2016October 2014 / When I first picked up Wintergirls, I was wading quickly into the deep end of an eating disorder without even realising it. If you'd asked me why I struggled so much to eat 'normally', my haughty response would have been something much along the lines of there is nothing wrong with watching what you eat. This book marked the first point in time that I came to realise that I was sick. While I still struggle with my ED, this book was an extreme eye-opener for me. It made me want to recover, and I'm more grateful for that than I can put into words. \nThis girl shivers and crawls under the covers with all her clothes on and falls into an overdue library book, a faerie story with rats and marrow and burning curses. The sentences build a fence around her, a Times New Roman 10-point barricade to keep the thorny voices in her head from getting too close.\nEDIT:October 2014, met Laurie Halse Anderson at a local book signing! The one author I wanted the very most to meet, and she was every bit as wonderful as I could possibly have imagined."}, {"userName": "L\u00f6r K.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59592712-l-r-k", "userReview": "First Read: April 2017Second Read: April 2017Third Read: May 2017Fourth Read: November 2017I might have a really bad obsession with this book.Update after reread: I just finished reading this for the second time and everything I said in my original review stands, goodbye, I love this book more than life itself.This beautiful books gets five solid stars from my eating disordered ass.Where can I even start with this book?Well, first of all, let me start this review with saying THIS is the book about eating disorders you want to read. In a world with a lot of books like Sad Perfect, horribly triggering, non researched, and disgustingly dangerous to the eating disorder community, we have Wintergirls. This book is well researched, so well written, and Laurie Halse Anderson has created a beautiful piece that is so respectful to those with eating disorders. I was really reluctant to start this, as a lot of books about eating disorders in the young adult genre are terribly written and have absolutely no concern for those with eating disorders that will read them, but I am so glad that I decided to sit and read this. Lia is an 18 year old girl with an eating disorder. She wants to be skinny, wants to be the perfect 85 pounds and to look fragile and delicate; bones are her drug of choice, they\u2019re her addiction. She needs them. I cannot talk about this book enough. This is THE book to read about eating disorders, and it was published all the way back in 2009; why is it all the old fiction books about eating disorders are the best ones to read<?. Anderson has done so much research and has portrayed such a beautiful character that I could connect with so easily. Lia broke my heart, and mended it, so many times throughout this book. She\u2019s a wonderful character, and as weird as this sound, I\u2019m kind of honoured she\u2019s a character that represents eating disorders.Anderson has such a way with writing that took me away. The writing style in this is unique for sure, and I\u2019ve seen a few low star reviews that didn\u2019t like the writing style \u2013 I think this is a Marmite situation, you either love it, or you hate it. I loved the chapter styling, how each chapter number was written up as though it were a weight on a scale. I think that was a really sweet touch, and I loved it so, so much. Everything was all connected, and it made me feel a lot more at ease reading this book with my ED. It made me feel like everything made perfect sense.I think there are a few issues with the book and the writing, I will admit that. Number one (which isn\u2019t really the book and more of a content warning) is that this is HEAVILY triggering dor those with an eating disorder. I\u2019m not gonna lie, this triggered me more times than I can count, and that number is definitely in the double figures. It\u2019s so beautifully seductive, if you are at risk of an eating disorder \u2013 do not read this. This is portrayed from the point of view with someone of an eating disorder, so, of course, it\u2019s quite glorified in certain ways and this should be taken into account before you read this. If there is even the slightest risk you could develop, or be triggered, or dragged out of recovery by this, \nplease do not read it\n.The one thing that did annoy me about the writing was the constant crossing out of lines as Lia spoke to herself in her head. I mean, I understand it, I do the exact same thing with my daily thoughts throughout the day, but it\u2019s really hard to read. I mean, I\u2019ve done it a lot in my own writing, but not to the degree Anderson has done in this. There\u2019s nothing wrong with using lines through sentences and words, but with the amount it happens in this book, it is rather frustrating, and you have to keep trying to reconnect to the story.The plot was wonderful, even I couldn\u2019t figure out where it was heading. I think Anderson did such an amazing job creating this book, a much better job than what I could do. I salute her. This is a hard story to write, and Anderson has even said that this was inspired by the readers that wrote to her about their eating disorders \u2013 this must have been hard to write as well for that connection. I applaud her, truly. I can\u2019t sell this book enough. I am so happy with this book and the way that it portrays eating disorders. I think this is a brilliant representation, and that it has really helped shape how people see people with eating disorders \u2013 how we really are, and not what society thinks we are."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael", "userReview": "I've read more than my fair share of scary stores--from the works of Edgar Allen Poe to Stephen King to Richard Matheson. But few of those works have ever chilled me, scared me and horrified me as much as Laurie Halse Anderson's \"Wintergirls.\"Part of it could be that Poe, King and Matheson are dealing in horrors that are terrifying but can be easily rationalized away as being supernatural in nature. The scary part of Anderson's novel is that what you're reading about is all too scarily real for a lot of young people in our world today.Lia is a teenage girl with an eating disorder. The story is told from her first-person persepective, making it all the more compelling. As the story begins, Lia is coming to terms with the death of her one-time best friend Cassie. Cassie called Lia 33 times on the night of her death, but Lia never answered. Now, Lia is haunted by that in the most literal sense of the world. Cassie begins to appear to Lia, questioning her and slowly the novel reveals the nature of their friendship and the scary pact the two made together. One afternoon, the two decide to see who can be the thinnest among them. The pact leads to two admissions to the hospital for Lia and she's slowly on the way to a third. Lia doesn't purge like Cassie does. Instead she denies herself anything more than 500 calories a day and spends hours exercising to try and reduce the few remaining pockets of perceived fat on her body. Lia is convinced that if you can't see bones through her skin, then she's too fat. The obsession with becoming thin is scarily and eerily presented here. Lia focuses on the weight she wants to be, at one point saying the ideal weight would be zero for herself. Lia also feels like she has tiny evil forces inside her that are only released by cutting herself. She also goes to great lengths to ensure that her step-mother and father don't realize she's losing weight, including drinking copious amounts of water before weigh-ins and sewing quarters into her robe that she wears during the weigh-ins. Even the horrifying revelation of how Cassie died doesn't deter Lia from her path toward destruction.Lia's story is a scary, dark one that is probably all too real for many young women in our world today. Anderson's decision to tell the story from inside Lia's head and to see her internal battle with wanting food and convincing herself she can't have it is one of many incredibly vivid moments in a book that will keep your attention. I read and liked her novel \"Speak\" because it allowed readers inside the character's head. \"Wintergirls\" follows the same convention but takes it to a wholly different level. Readers will both identify with Lia, but we're kept detached enough to see that what she's doing isn't heroic, but self-destructive. You'll be rooting for her to get the help she so desparately need and as the situation slowly sinks into greater and greater dispair, you'll be hoping and praying Lia won't meet the same end as Cassie."}, {"userName": "Claudia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70211-claudia", "userReview": "This one was worth the wait. I had to wait while the pre-publication copy flew around my classes. This one is her best. She writes flawlessly in the voice of Lia, a sad, disturbed, disturbing, girl who may or may NOT be recovering from her recent hospitalization for anorexia...We hear everything in Lia's head. Her real thoughts, which she revises out of her own head, her ambivilance toward her parents, her anger she can't quite express, let us know she's sicker than she will admit. We also see her incredibly mixed feeling about Cassie, her former-best friend, whose death because of complications of bulimia. Is Cassie really haunting her? What about their agreement to be Wintergirls -- to be the skinniest? Mythological images and fairy tale images add another layer to this rich story...Persephone is never far from the surface -- the original Wintergirl. Watching Lia waste away from us is some of the most painful reading I have done. Anderson handles her descent into madness with power and skill. Like Lia, we the readers, are almost surprised to see how far she's sunk until it's almost too late.As harrowing as this was to read, I can only imagine the pain it took to be this honest, this close to the bone.
