And it\u2019s no wonder why this is such a sentimental, LK fan favorite...Derek Craven...*dreamy sigh*.Author Sara Fielding wants to observe the workings of London\u2019s underground gaming halls for her latest novel, including the most famous gambling club of all, Craven\u2019s, and the notorious man who runs it. Derek Craven, the sexy, cynical, hardened cockney son of a prostitute, grew up on the rough streets of London and learned to make his way in the dangerous rookeries by any means necessary, eventually accumulating vast wealth and power by running a popular, thriving gaming club. Derek has erected strong defenses and adopted a detached, cool, blas\u00e9 fa\u00e7ade to hide his emotions, protect his heart, and conceal his longing for the things in life he doesn\u2019t think he deserves and can never have: honor, respect, trust, friendship, love, and family. Of course, he never counted on an innocent, brave, inquisitive, genuine, mousy, and tenderhearted spinster like Sara Fielding shaking up his life and tearing down his walls of self-protection.Derek Craven is such an endearing, diamond in the rough hero because he\u2019s a tortured soul and deeply flawed, yet he has a huge, albeit tarnished, heart of gold and such vast potential for love; and when he falls for Sara, he falls hard and forever. The way he cherishes and protects Sara like the world\u2019s greatest treasure is incredibly sweet and romantic. Dreaming of You is a poignant, passionate story about the invincible power of love that tugs the heartstrings and that stays with you a long time after it\u2019s over.

It was one of my fav as the tortured hero goes he was the best. However, I must say looking back on it now I can see that it was an ok read but it also had some questionable moments like when he first sees her and does not help her out but she saves his life. He is a street rat and does not know any other way to be but basic. The fact that he does not have sex with her when she throws herself at him says how hard he was trying to do right by her. He really does think he can never have her as she is too good and pure and he is who he is. So he sends her away and eventually sleeps with another woman who looks like her and calling the heroines name the whole time. This poor woman goes to visit the heroine to ask her to come back and tells her all about what he had done and how he is behaving.  I loved his struggle with his feelings and her emotional and sexual awakening.This was a great story and the characters came alive off the pages for me. Very enjoyable. The masked ball was one of my favorite when he discovers that she is the girl under the mask that he is trying to seduce.

Sara Fielding is a young writer from the country who visits the casino for research on her latest book, but what she finds is one *irresistible* man who doesn't want to give her the time of day.This is one of those books that once you read, you never forget. The lust, the love, the way everything unfolds is perfect. Beautifully strong hero and heroine. You honestly can't lose with this book. It is book 2 of the Gambler series, but can be read as a standalone book. This, along with Kleypas' \"Again the Magic,\" are my all-time favorite books period.

CRAVEN!!!I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for me to talk about this book without excessive gushing! I\u2019ve heard great things about Derek Craven, about how he\u2019s Kleypas\u2019 favourite hero that she\u2019s ever written and now I understand why! Derek is the most haunted, the most broken out of all the heroes she has written. And I thought Kev from the Hathaways was intense! Derek easily stole my heart in  Then Came You and he broke it in  Dreaming of You!And then there\u2019s Sara Rose Fieldings whom I just adore as well! As an author, she\u2019s quiet and observant, always perceptive about the world around her, especially of Derek. She is able to see past the gritty exterior that Derek has protected himself with and see him not as a poor, abandoned Cockney chimney boy and whore, but a man of intelligence and strong will. This has easily become one of my new favourite books! Kleypas has me laughing out loud at some parts and my heart breaking in others. I just love the fact that Kleypas is able to create such vividly real characters with a soul. Derek Craven has definitely topped my list of favourite LK heroes along with Kev Merripen from the Hathaways, Sebastian St. Vincent from the Wallflowers and McKenna! I just can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t read this sooner!Bottom line? If you haven\u2019t read anything by Kleypas before, get out of that hole you\u2019ve been living in and start with the first book in the Gambler series, Then Came You or start with the Wallflowers prequel, Again the Magic! You won\u2019t be disappointed!Favourite Quote:He met her gaze defiantly, his jaw set. A small muscle twitched in his cheek. Then she understood. \u201cAre you having problems with your sight, Mr. Craven?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cOr is it your heart?\u201d"}, {"userName": "Crista", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3194546-crista", "userReview": "I read this book at least once a year, and have been doing so for the past 5 years. There really are not enough words for this love story. Each time I read it, I think that I've romanticized it in my mind, and each time I am left with the same amazed, giddy, and warm-fuzzies that I experienced that last time I read it. If you are a romance fan...this is an absolute MUST READ. DEREK CRAVEN is a name that you'll take with you to the grave! This man is so positively unforgettable that I struggle to capture his character to it's fullest. After 5 readings, I still am left with a further understanding of him....and he is absolutely endearing (to say the least). Derek is a self-made man. He has worked his way from the lowest forms of humanity to become one of the wealthiest and most successful men in England. He is also a man filled with shame. He is afraid of love, desertion, and relationships that could cause him pain. Sara is incredible. She is honest and forthright. Seeing Derek for who he is, not excusing his past behavior, but understanding why he is how he is. She sneaks past all his defenses and as hard as he tries to stay away from her.....he can't. She expects nothing of him, yet FOR HER, he becomes all she could dream of...AND MORE. His love for her is so compelling and believable that it literally takes my breath away. I can not say enough about this book....I read it again yesterday and am still smiling today. Perfect.

When she saves a man from being attacked she is astounded to realize that it is none other than the owner of the renowned gaming hall Mr Derek Craven. In repayment for saving his life he lets the spinsterish but adventurous Miss Fielding into his club for her research; however, the little \u201cmouse\u201d seems to be getting under his skin, cracking the wall he has carefully erected over his emotions and heart.Lisa Kleypas is a very talented writer and this book is one of her best, in fact it is one of the best romances historical or otherwise that I have read. And what makes it so good is Derek Craven, a truly brilliantly well rounded character, you get a glimpse of him in Then Came You but in this book he is outstanding; a truly unforgettable hero. He is a dark and complex character and the more you learn and understand about him and glimpse beneath his cold and mocking exterior you start to fall head over heels in love with him. He has a chequered past, which I won\u2019t reveal any of as I don\u2019t want to spoil it, because of this he doesn\u2019t think he is good enough for Sara; with this mixture of danger and vulnerability I challenge any woman not to fall instantly in love with him!Sara is another prime example of Ms Klepas's skill at creating unforgettable and well rounded character. She wasn\u2019t the typical blushing country maiden and I found her charming, her naivet\u00e9 despite having written a rather worldly book and her good nature made her the kind of person you wish you knew and were friends with. She is definitely one of my favourite heroines. The romance between Derek and Sara was intense, Derek is a man of extremes and when he loves, he love violently and it is coveyed fantastically well on the page. It kept me riveted to the page and Derek and Sara have remained one of my favourite of her couples. Also if you are a fan of the Wallflower Quartet you get a glimpse of Ivo Jenner, Evie\u2019s father, I love how her books all connect together.Anyone with a love for dark, tormented and dangerously complicated heroes as well as those who like wallflower/bluestocking stories (if you love both, you are in luck!) this should make it on your must-read-right-now list, but I recommend that anyone who is a fan of romance give this a try.Sara on Love\"Don't you understand how much even one day of loving each other is worth? Some people are searated by distances that can never cross. All they can do is dream about each other for a lifetime, never having what they want most. How foolish, how wasteful to havr love within your reach and not take it!\"Derek on LoveThere was also the occasional bite of resentment when he realized she had become the source of all pleasure to him, all comfort and peace. She was the first human being he had ever needed. He had lost his freedom in a way he had never imagined possible, bound more securely by her love than by a mile's length of iron chains"}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22412202-danielle", "userReview": "A tortured soul meets a specktacled author.This was a really great one by Lisa Kleypas.Derek was a street-rat on the English streets. He did all kinds of things to survive - most of them lying, cheating, stealing. He worked his way to the top by sleeping with rich, blue-blooded women who funded his club and he became one of the richest men in England. He carries around his past like a hard weight and he doesn't feel he deserves much. And when Sara, the spinster author, saves him one night, he knows for sure that he doesn't deserve her. Oh my lanta, did I love Derek. When he gets angry his cockney accent comes out, and I just wanted to swoon, but then I remembered that we don't do that these days. He's rough. He's gruff. He wants what he wants when he wants it. He doesn't apologize. And he's just down-right dirty. He's the man who would bring a knife to a fist fight.There was so much push and pull in this book. It was flooded with the \"I want her so bad, but I don't deserve her\" and I loved it! Push/pull is my pal. There was so much conflict, and seeing Derek fall for Sara was the sweetest thing I have ever seen. The ending was just perfect, and I need an ex street-rat in my life now.

I acknowledged his tragic past, however, the problem I have encountered with his aspect is that he justifies his actions often irresponsible ones by his past experiences and to me this is not good for his character growth. For me a real \"Hero\" is a character that progresses systematically throughout the story and demonstrate the redeeming qualities that makes the reader... \"accept and forgive\" his wrongdoing, so there is a balance. I found the social judgement on the married woman who had an affair with the hero very unjust one, as every character in this book was disgusted with his ex mistress, but not really about him having sex with her whilst she had marital status and add he is committing to adultery fully without remorse. In those moments, I questioned the author for not allowing the characters to confront Derek for being so brainless by indulging with someone's wife when this woman caused so much pain and trouble because he ever so suddenly got tired of her and rejected her?????? Not only that soon after the dumped woman nearly killed Derek, but insulted Derek's friend and her daughter in her own house and then she planed on hurting the heroine Sara by arranging someone raping her in Derek's friend's house????? I was disappointed at this turn of events, as no one really confronted Derek about him causing all this... He was the responsible one of all the damage caused by his former mistress because he started this by sleeping with her at the first place. He even did not apologize to his friends for causing all the distress...I wish the author could have challenged the hero by allowing his friend's to \"finally\" question his choice of affairs with women, for example...\"You really need to put yourself together and start thinking with your head and not with your lower parts because you actions are affecting other peoples life and we don't want to be expose to this brutality\"His friend did mentioned something at the beginning of the book, but it was very little confrontation and the hero called Lilly a \"BI**T\"... not very appealing to call his friend that was always for him in such a way. The heroine was nearly raped by the heroes ex mistress, but in the next moment was defending him by justifying him by putting the blame on his ex mistress and not on him. But the fact of the matter is, that it takes two to do that tango...so in my humble opinion he was liable in the same level as his former mistress for all the damages caused. Its true that some of these traits add hints of realism to the novel, but this book is a romance novel, hence its design to inspire fantasy and a feeling of enjoyment, I felt none of this. WHY could the hero just talk to his ex mistress instead humiliating her? What did he expect that after he left her like garbage she would just forget about him? he new what the woman was capable of, Yet he could not behave like a \"man\" \"A real man would have a real conversation with her\" and explaining his refusal to be with her in a decent way at least with some level of respect as he could make it at the time. THAT would have been good for his character growth. Instead of doing the right thing, the author gave him the easy way out, by making the \"other woman\" an evil b***h, so that he would look more a \"hero\" compare to her actions by wanting revenge etcetera...I was really not charmed with Derek's cold and disrespectful attitude towards women...He was a rake I gather but he did not have to treat them like trash...I understand he had no choice over his tragic upbringing, but he definitely had a choice after becoming reach and he did not need to sleep with married women so that left a bad taste in my mouth and I had dislike for him. I also understand that this is a romance, but thinking of all the married women he slept with makes me feel immoral...WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE FAMILIES OF THOSE MARRIED WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN? I WOULD RATHER WANT TO READ ABOUT HIM TRYING WIN HEROINE OVER...For me the magic that holds that special sparks that makes the romance cherished went down the drain in here! A true love is about learning to see the beauty in another person (the other significant) regardless of their faults and Sara was willing to accept him with his past, but he chose to be alone and sleep with other women...A special relationship is also about transforming a normal relationship into a deeper one without further interest in others and I could not find that here!"}, {"userName": "Rane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1987431-rane", "userReview": "This was such a beautiful story that had me reading it in about one sitting!

Derek and Sara are as different as day and night, while Derek is left jaded and cold from his past, Sara is very innocent but the sensual level between them sizzles at each meeting. Both have different strengths in each other but together they become stronger and complete. Derek is complete at times, but hides and runs away from Sara as he starts to fall in love with her, Sara shows a great strength as she opens her heart to Derek knowing he may not love her, still willing to take a risk and take a chance on love. It was great to re-visit Lily and Alex as they (mostly Lily) give a push to get Derek and Sara together. While being friends that stand besides the couple in any situation. The villain was a b**** no, really she was, but I found great enjoyment when she was finally stopped by none other the Sara herself.

It's a wonder she actually decided to marry a man, what with the way she loathes them. Moving on from Lily.So, Derek. He is my man. I love his guts. Seriously. Lily claimed he was a heartless, uncaring man, when, obviously, he was not. Lily's problem is that she thinks she's God and prances about trying to control everyone's lives while giggling about how men are like pets blah blah blah. Wow, I thought I was talking about Derek! So. What I like about him is that he actually acts like a man, and not just a woman's version of a man. He's imperfect, and I love him all the more for it. On top of that, he's not afraid to nigh-on strangle a woman to death just because she's a woman. I mean, come one, the lady was a psychotic, murderous bitch and he deserved to defend himself! And underneath all that sexy swagger, he was adorably vulnerable. About Sara. I like her. Truly I do. HOWEVER, I'd like to point out that she is an enormous hypocrite. She goes off for weeks and makes out with a near-stranger, despite being in a relationship with another man. I consider this cheating, whether they were married or not. Then she goes back to her home town and gets pissy with her man because he's the typical pompous a-hole that all the potential-but-not-meant-to-be-husbands are in romance novels. Then she agrees to marry him, despite the fact that she is in love with someone else and had cheated on him numerous times. Now, would Sara have been mad if she found out Perry had been trading spit with another woman? Um, yes. But, you know, it's okay for her to cheat, because she's a woman, and women are exempt from all blame, as they are all innocent angels, and because her potential-but-not-meant-to-husband is a bit pompous and rude.This is how I picture Sara:Now, don't get me wrong. I found Sara to be a likable heroine, because she's kind, accepting, understanding, and sweet. Unlike Lily, she seems to like men, and she's actually nice to Derek, whereas Lily wants to keep her husband, Alex, as a pet. Poor Alex, having to be in love with that witch. Plus, Sara shot a man to save Derek's life, which is badass, for a country girl!An aspect of this book that I really liked was that, for once, it was the hero who had the stalker! NOT THE HEROINE!!!! This was me when I found this out:Yeah?I'd just like to complain about the fact that I once read for an entire hour without the hero showing up, and, frankly, I grew bored of Sara, since she is boring. I do like her, but...I'm generally more interested in the man, and this was very much Sara's story, despite the fact that Derek was the interesting character. However, Lisa Kleypas is fond of her heroines, so...I was forced to muddle through. Derek's \"rejection\" of Sara got old after a time, because the whole \"I'm not good enough for my heroine\" is beyond old. Also, it took waaay too long for Sara and Derek to get together--and I don't mean sex. I just mean...they never really had a relationship. However, once they did get together, it was beautiful to watch. Oh, and Sara actually had nice, likable parents! It's a miracle!!! I was so glad that they FINALLY gave into their love for each other, and I was actually treated to a couple hours of lovely love! Yes, it took too long, but at least when it came, it didn't vanish.Also, two scenes in this book were taken up by various people attempting to rape Sara. Both times, Derek beats the culprits to a pulp. This is what happened when SpongeBob and Patrick glanced at Sara the wrong way:Poor lads! But that's what you get for coming in between Derek and his wummun. Kleypas has lots of different insulting names for men, my favorite being \"bucks,\" since she gets her giggles off degrading men. There were quite a number of bucks attending the balls, and I must say, I'm shocked! How could they allow bucks into the ballroom? Haven't they heard of Lyme Disease? Guess not.^ See that fella up there? He and his buds tried to steal Sara from Derek, but he wasn't having any of that. Poor guys became a hat-hanger. Tears, people. Tears. But for real, I didn't hate this book. It was just a bit slow and boring and not up to par with, well, anything. I was a big fan of the ending, when Derek finally admitted his love for Sara. It was actually really beautiful, and I thoroughly, completely believed him. As an added bouns, we got to see him interacting with his baby girl in the epilogue, which was adorable, because he proved Sara wrong (she'd thought he'd be sort of an aloof father). Also, Kleypas has a thing for heroines named \"Lily.\" She loves them, I hate them. They're always ee--vi--all bee--atch--ezz."}, {"userName": "MaDoReader", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37064828-madoreader", "userReview": "Bueno, por fin he tenido el placer de conocer a Derek Craven ^^Con todo lo que hab\u00eda o\u00eddo hablar de \u00e9l, creo que llevaba hecha otra idea y aunque me ha gustado mucho, siento que Sara le ha robado el protagonismo, he visto el libro muy centrado en ella, y yo quer\u00eda (ansiaba) m\u00e1s Mr. Craven.Por lo dem\u00e1s, qu\u00e9 decir que no se haya dicho ya, hay muchas rese\u00f1as maravillosas en GR, simplemente que os recomiendo su lectura, yo al menos lo he disfrutado.Por cierto Elsa, s\u00ed, la segunda parte del libro es la mejor ;)"}, {"userName": "Tammy Walton Grant", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3047961-tammy-walton-grant", "userReview": "This is going to be another review where I apologize to every GR friend who loves this book. I'm sorry guys, I just didn't. I tried - I really did!I didn't connect with either Derek or Sara, I didn't care for the story, and found myself skipping the love scenes. SKIPPING THE LOVE SCENES, folks. (That doesn't happen very often, I'm a bit of a dirty girl.)The whole book was meh for me, and frankly some parts made me uncomfortable. I dunno what it was, but it was like my brain shied away as soon as the mushy-gushy stuff started happening. This has been the third Lisa Kleypas I've read in the past month. The more I read (especially this one) the more she reminds me of Judith McNaught. The caveat is: McNaught's writing is lusher, with more historical detail, with more angst in her stories and emotional depth in her characters. Of course, I say angst, someone else says overwrought and OTT; tomato, tomahto, lol. This story felt forced to me, shallow and contrived at times. I didn't feel like Derek Craven could carry a book on his own, and Sara - well, she bored the shit out of me. I found it to be soooooooo romantic and sweet that it was cloying and almost OTT. It reminded me of when I was little and used to make up love stories for my Barbie and Ken dolls.(Just so you know, I haven't forgotten my comparison to McNaught. She, too, could be accused of being OTT romantic, especially with her Heroes and the impassioned declarations of love they make in her books, but for some reason she works for me, where Kleypas just didn't with this one.)I had just read Then Came You, where we are introduced to Derek Craven because of his friendship with Lily Lawson. The Craven we meet in that book was interesting, if very rough around the edges. The Derek Craven we meet in his own book, although it starts out well enough (right down to his cut-with-a-knife Cockney accent) it all went downhill for me after the first couple of chapters.And through the whole book, I continually asked myself this question: What the hell happened to his accent?2 stars."}, {"userName": "Celeste", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1062992-celeste", "userReview": "WOW! I loved Dreaming of You by Lisa Kleypas! I would even go so far as to say it rivals my affections for Devil in Winter,(my all time fav LK book) - no easy feat for sure!There are many trials and ups and downs Derek and Sara face throught the book; it is non-stop action from the very beginning. They have got the sweetest relationship. The chemistry between them was electrifying and I couldn't get enough of them! I was actually sad for the book to end! Very good romantic read.And once again I start a series out of order!

I'm rounding to 4 stars.I'll begin by saying that LK's earlier works are definitely from a different era. Perhaps one that doesn't allow romance authors to get too explicit with their love scenes (unfortunately). Not only was I made to wait until 70+% through the book before I actually got to it, the scenes themselves felt rushed, leaving a feeling of dissatisfaction. Now, I know LK can write pretty hot love scenes. By the time the Hathaways series came along, she was already taking the heat up a notch. And her most recent series the Ravenels are even hotter. But her earlier works, at least for me, are not terribly fulfilling in the love scenes department, hence 1 star off.The other .25 star off is for all the pages I skipped trying to get back to the two main characters and their relationship development. I felt like Ivo Jenner and Joyce were given too much text, as well as Sara's ex-fiance. There were some moments I was ticked at Sara's flightiness. But thankfully they were momentary, and anyway I skipped most of it. I do like Derek Craven a lot. But he's not my fav LK Hero. He is legendary, however, and rightly so. But the whole mess with Joyce (and all his other sexual experiences) turned me off.And finally, what's up with the hairy chests??? I know that was the thing way back when, when these romances were written. It was a different day and age before laser hair removal. I'm not fond of hairy men. I had a very hard time trying to imagine a version of naked Derek that was marginally appealing!Come to think of it. I'll give it 3.5 stars, rounded up."}, {"userName": "Zoe", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6168938-zoe", "userReview": "I have reread this book many times since my youth but the most recent reread made me take this book down a peg. I had loved Derek Craven as a character and he alone made the book great for me. I have always thought that his fascination for Sara Fielding came out of nowhere. But Derek was such a compelling character. And what girl doesn't like the idea of a bad boy changing for love? The story itself is the typical bad boy gets redemption through his relationship with the good girl. I reread this book this week for maybe the 100th time. I don't know what happened. I developed a severe disliking for Sara Fielding. Being the person that I am today, Sara Fielding seemed compulsive and immature. I don't know why Derek fell in love with her. What was it about her that was so special? I don't understand. I sure as hell don't like her. And that made it difficult for me to imagine that a man like Derek would be head over heels for her. This is one of those sad moments when you realize that as a reader you have grown out of one of your old favorites. As a young girl, or even young woman, I had only eyes for Derek. But now the woman matters to me, if not more than the male lead. I need to like the female character to love a book. And I didn't like Sara Fielding. She seemed plain and all she seemed to have was her glasses and books. As a character she paled in comparison to Derek. And somehow to me Derek lost part of his allure for being so in love with Sara, if that made sense at all. I still think Lisa Kleypas a great writer. And I like this book well enough. I just don't love this book anymore, much to my regret."}, {"userName": "SheReadsALot", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6270231-shereadsalot", "userReview": "My fave Lisa Kleypas of all time!Derek Craven forever!RATED ALL THE DAMN STARS IN THE SKY!
