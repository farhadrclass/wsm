For someone who knows a decent amount about the Tudors and Medieval England, I was shocked at how big of a role spying played back then. It wasn\u2019t just basic spying either: it was sophisticated and at times, incredibly complicated. Stephen Alford has documented the lives of some of the main players in the spy game, from the talented to the incompetent, the eccentric to the boring.Although Alford\u2019s writing can get a bit choppy here and there as he jumps from spy to spy, he does tie things up well at the end of the chapters and at the very end of the book. Despite the head-hopping, the writing style itself was very engaging for a nonfiction writer and made The Watchers far more enjoyable.To illustrate his point that spying was very important in Tudor England, he had a very lengthy introduction imagining a scenario in which spies did not exist and Elizabeth I really had been assassinated. I would have liked for the introduction to be cut down slightly, but Alford certainly did make his point well.One thing I really liked about The Watchers is that Alford isn\u2019t telling a completely one-sided story of the struggle of Protestants to protect their queen from evil Catholics. We get to see how the Protestant agents felt about their missions, but also get to see things from the point of view of Catholic exiles. it\u2019s rare to find such balanced nonfiction these days, but Alford managed it. The political triumphs of courtiers like Lord Burghley are balanced by accounts of the terrible torture captured Catholics faced. Alford does not depict a picture of a Golden Age as most books about Elizabethan England seem to and we get to see that the ugly side of the Golden Age was quite ugly at times. It\u2019s nice to find a more realistic portrayal of the times.Overall, The Watchers is a great book for both newcomers to history and old hats at it. Personally, I\u2019m looking forward to any future books Stephen Alford publishes.I give this book 4.5/5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars for the purpose of Goodreads ratings."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6947913-jenny", "userReview": "The golden age of England, underneath, was a time when secrets were a form of currency just a precious as gold.Stephen Alford's \"The Watchers: A Secret History of the Reign of Elizabeth I\" was an excellent book about one of my all-time favorite eras of history the Tudor Reign. I've read several books about the Tudors, and this book showed that Elizabeth's rule was a precarious and fragile thing; the Protestant monarch had many enemies at home and abroad, at times her network of spies was all that stood between rule and ruin.First, you have to like a book with such detailed references. A good sign of a non-fiction book's character (or lack thereof) will be revealed if a book has a strong backbone of source material. I also thought the layout of the beginning of the book was excellent, the author set up the characters like that of a playbill, giving a brief description of the parts each person played-out in this game of spies. This was beneficial, since there was a number of players to keep straight, and having a quick guide to turn back to was helpful.Although I was aware of Elizabeth's most trusted advisor William Cecil's cunning, and his web of information that was far-reaching, I did not know to what extent and how wide the network of underground information-gathering reached. Alford showcased the inner-turmoil of the country, where Protestants were once again in favor and Catholics fled the country for fear of persecution or worse. Catholics that left the country, however, were not safe for the ever-watchful eyes of England\u2019s spies. Alford\u2019s book gave in detail a number of entertaining and well-documented accounts of how England\u2019s spies went about procuring their information, and how these spies give evidence against men they had lived with ,worked for, and befriended. The book also described the Throckmorton Plot to overthrow Elizabeth, and place Catholic Mary Queen of Scots on the throne.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Elizabethan or Tudor history, or those interested in reading about the lucrative business of information-gathering. Alford's \"The Watchers: A Secret History of the Reign of Elizabeth I\" was a well-written and thoroughly researched book that I found very entertaining and informative."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul", "userReview": "Elizabeth I reigned for a total of 45 years in England, and the stability she gave as head of state gave us the Golden Age of wealth and greater self-assurance as a nation. The final Tudor monarch saw a cultural advances too, this being the time of Shakespeare and military confidence on the high seas. However, the Europeans saw her very differently; as daughter of Anne Boylen, Henry VIII's second wife, she was considered a bastard and Protestant heretic by catholic Europe. Following her denouncement by the Pope various European rulers prepared plans to dispose her, replacing her with Mary. The event that most people are aware of is the almost invasion by The Spanish Armada, but throughout her reign she was protected by a team of loyal subjects.These men were a motley bunch of ambassadors, codebreakers, and confidence-men and spies who used all sort of covert and overt methods to counter the catholic threat. Infiltrators were sent to the continent to ingratiate themselves with the church, uncovering conspiracies both real and imagined, identified and followed gentlemen who were plotting the overthrow of their Queen. The network tracked priests entering the country under cover, intercepted and deciphered almost all correspondence between suspects in England and their contacts in France, Spain and Italy and neutered the threat that hung over the crown.Drawing on documents from archive and collections, Alford shines a light into this dark and shadowy time of history. The narrative details tense searches across the countryside looking for specific people who were perceived to be a threat to the crown. Traitors who were convicted, sometimes only on hearsay and confessions uttered under torture on the rack, were condemned in horrific ways to die. It is an interesting account of those involved in keeping their monarch safe from all the assassination attempts and plots, but at times was fairly complicated as he details all the people involved in these plots. Worth reading though for those that like their Tudor history."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3458028-ruth", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. The subtitle is \"a secret history of the reign of Elizabeth I\", but I feel that doesn't actually explain just what an insightful, but accessible, book this one is. It includes some really fascinating details on spies and spying in Elizabethan Europe, but it also describes the state of almost perpetual paranoia during a period of history which Hollywood likes to glamorize as the \"golden age\" of monarchy. It wasn't a golden age. Elizabeth maintained a dazzling but strict distance from the majority of her advisors and from the plebs which made her appear all the more awe-inspiring, and she was definitely an extremely intelligent, astute and ruthless individual, who aimed to find outcomes to the issues of the day which put her in the best possible position with little effort on her behalf which I can only admire, but for me the real heroes appear to be the astonishingly clever, worldly, and subtle \"administrators\". They worked to protect the aura of majesty around the Queen, and keep safe both her, and the hard-won religious freedom of an England surrounded by Catholics. The Great Armada was not the climax in English-Spanish military history I was taught at school, but simply one battle in a long cold war, which occasionally boiled over, and was only extinguished when James Stuart came to the throne, complete with his ready-made heirs, and finally resolved the agonies of the Tudor succession (well, for a generation or two, at least). This almost obsessive passion for maintaining the Protestant religious freedom of England was something which James II, the grandson of James Stuart (nor Charles I, to a lesser extent) never understood, but which Charles II understood to his bones.I understand the religious history of the age (at least to a certain extent), but this book brought it alive for me. Think of a relatively minor, new religion (or cult) today, and imagine that a president or prime minister decides that for their own expediency this new religion is going to be what everyone in that country must follow. Now imagine after a bloody tussle of a few decades of back-and-forth, all the \"non-believers\" are essentially persecuted into exile. Some of them will decide to make their homes where they land, but others will do all they can to go home on their own terms (whilst maintaining loyalty to the government) and others will do all they can to destroy the government in the name of the \"old\" religion. Other countries see this an opportunity to invade and take the heretic country for themselves (it's not particularly wealthy, but its geographic location makes it important for trade, and it has been supporting insurgents/terrorists overseas for years), and they spend money and time and decades trying to do so. That is the picture of Elizabethan Europe you get from this book.This book is also interesting for its descriptions of how espionage was actually physically carried out in the 16th century. It surprised me how much is resembled modern espionage. It relied upon having well-placed, non-descript individuals, either motivated by overwhelming loyalty or vast wads of money, or threatened into spying. They wrote their reports, encrypted them and shipped them to their handlers, who then pieced them together to try and form an accurate picture of threats, so they could device counterpolicy. Essentially what happens now.Great book. I could go on for ever about how much I got out of it.. 5 stars. It was amazing."}, {"userName": "Nicholas Whyte", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte", "userReview": "http://nwhyte.livejournal.com/2207951.html[return][return]this is a study of how the leadership of the English government maintained an intelligence service to protect the realm, in particular the Cecils and Sir Francis Walsingham. I'll say up front that I had a couple of disappointments - there is very little about Ireland, and I'd hoped for at least a passing mention of John Bossy's Giordano Bruno theory and didn't get one. But I was very satisfied with the overall detailed picture of the Queen's advisors, determined to preserve her rule at all costs, much more ruthless than she would have been (as witness her dithering over the execution of Mary Queen of Scots) and also somewhat more anti-Catholic. [return][return]It's easy to overlook two very important facts about the historical situation: first, that nobody knew that Elizabeth would live to 1603, and the uncertainty about her succession, which she deliberately fostered to some extent, was profoundly destabilising to those who wanted to think ahead to the next reign; and second, that information just did not really flow between countries - there were no newspapers, statesmen did not give interviews, official communications between rulers and magnates had to be supplemented by intelligence gathered by agents in important centres abroad. One of the tools of statecraft therefore was to have a widespread network of contacts, who would demand regular payment in return for information; this still happens today, of course, but unlike today there was almost no OSINT to check the HUMINT against. Another important point is that most of the information was channeled to the principals directly, and never shown to anyone else except, if really necessary, the Queen.[return][return]Given these two factors, Alford makes it almost uncontroversial, though of course potentially very dangerous, that Walsingham essentially framed Mary Queen of Scots for execution through the Babington Plot; although Babington himself, who was only 24, was clearly a rather slender reed for the restoration of Catholicism, Mary was an ever present temptation for someone more competent while she lived. Walsingham and Cecil were ruthless, but they had seen the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, and indeed had perpetrated plenty of sectarian violence themselves; they knew perfectly well what awaited them in the event of a further change of official ideology. Elizabethan England, providing security at home for economic stability and some encouragement of culture, at the cost of repression of the surviving loyalists to the former regime and paranoia about their foreign allies, seems not so very different from Pinochet's Chile, or the less corrupt Eastern European countries under Communism."}, {"userName": "Ed ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1168406-ed", "userReview": "\u201cThe Watchers\u201d gives us a very different view of Elizabethan England than we (or at least I) are used to. Instead of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Ben Jonson and the university wits there is the constant threat of invasion and the first stirrings of a centralized police state. Elizabeth is not the Gloriana of Spenser\u2019s \u201cFaerie Queen\u201d but a headstrong monarch who put her kingdom at risk by refusing to name a successor. While the arts flourished, voyages of discovery sent out and everyone went to the theater\u2014except when they were closed by the plague\u2014there were undercurrents of treachery, perfidy and treason. The queen might be assassinated, Phillip of Spain\u2019s armies might embark from the Low Countries and cross the narrow sea to land on English beaches and the horror of religious civil war could be imminent. Mary, Queen of Scots and cousin of Elizabeth would be freed from house arrest to rule as a Catholic monarch. None of this happened; Stephen Alford does his best to show that it was due to the machinations of two men, William Cecil and Francis Walsingham, the queen\u2019s spymasters, directors of the watchers of the title and the employers of spies, turncoats and torturers. Alford knows the sources, has a firm sense of narrative and tells the story well.Three actions had to occur for the plot to succeed. The queen had to die, preferably at the hand of a man claiming to be a loyal Englishman and devout Catholic (Elizabeth had already been condemned as a heretic, schismatic and bastard), Mary, her cousin, had to be proclaimed the new queen, soon to marry a Catholic monarch from the continent, either Phillip of Spain or the Duke of Guise of France, and the army of a Catholic country had to invade while Catholic nobles from the north of England and Scotland raised a rebellion. The plots were constant and Alford shows how Cecil and Walsingham\u2019s spies in France and Italy kept track of them while their operatives in the ports kept watch for seditious literature produced by the \u00e9migr\u00e9 community and for priests trying to sneak into the country. Alford begins with a counterfactual account of a successful assassination plot against the queen in 1566 with the chaos and strife that would follow. It sets up his thesis, that all the spying, torturing and killing that took place to keep Elizabeth safe was both necessary and proper. He ends with the queen dying in her bed and James IV of Scotland, soon to be James I of England, ready to accept the crown. He was the son of her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots sent to the block by Elizabeth in 1567. The peaceful succession was quietly arranged during Elizabeth\u2019s last illness by Robert Cecil, son of William Cecil and the new spymaster of the realm.

And, for the most part, this book had what I wanted. There is an insane level of detail here; many, many documents get referenced. I also liked how the author explained all of the broader concepts at work as well, for those of us who don't know off the top of our head the politics of Philip's Spanish court. Yes, there is an obvious bias, but it's so mundane that it didn't really affect my reading. (Alford may be in love with Phelippes, just saying). But anyway. I think this book gave a very comprehensive overview of the state of espionage in Elizabethan England, as well as a pretty good idea of what the political climate was like. It would probably be a great source (that leads to MANY great sources), but I really did read it for fun. And, I do have to say that Alford makes his subject very accessible, so that reading it wasn't a chore and was actually enjoyable.My only slight annoyance was how much he would focus on one particular person, and then completely forget them later on. If you're going to give me someone's life story, you have to finish it. Other than that, there is very little to complain about here."}, {"userName": "Karen Brooks", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2382210-karen-brooks", "userReview": "Sent this book by the publishers, I really looked forward to reading what\u2019s ostensibly a behind the scenes account of Queen Elizabeth I\u2019s reign but from the point of view of the \u201cwatchers\u201d: that is, reporters, listeners, spies \u2013 the men whose speciality was espionage. Elizabethan times, it turns out, are notorious for their extensive use of spies and networks, all of which were established to protect England and ensure the queen\u2019s successful reign. As Alford writes in the introduction, while Elizabeth and her council worked hard to maintain \u201cclever and persuasive projections of political stability, empire, self-confidence and national myth\u201d there was, in fact, \u201ca darker story\u2026 set against a Europe divided and oppressed by religious conflict, civil war and the ambitions of kings and princes.\u201dTaking the crown after her half-sister \u201cBloody Mary\u201d tried to purge the Protestant stain, and trying to stabilise an England divided by religious schism and rapidly changing succession, Elizabeth\u2019s job was not easy. Declaring England as Protestant, but claiming that Catholicism would be tolerated, Elizabeth nonetheless was acutely aware of how precarious her position as ruler and religious head of a reeling nation was. Plots to declare her rule invalid, assassination attempts, never mind trying to overthrow Elizabeth and place Mary Queen of Scots on the throne abounded. Then there was the job of trying to find Elizabeth a suitable husband, all of which meant that though the kingdom flourished in terms of exploration, the humanities and arts, there was also a seething underbelly that threatened to erupt and destroy everything at any time. The greatest threat was that of the Catholics who, discontent with Elizabeth\u2019s heretical leadership and perceiving it as ungodly, sought to rid themselves of Henry VIII\u2019s daughter and restore the \u201ctrue religion\u201d. Working from within their homeland, their overseas networks were extensive, travelling across Europe and involving some of the most powerful people abroad as well. The stage is thus set for espionage, betrayal, treason, propaganda, secrets, torture, faith, martyrdom and lies all of which Sir Francis Walsingham and his successors sought to control. Carefully researched and very well-written, this book is an eye-opener that also makes the mind boggle. The lengths to which various individuals would go to inveigle themselves into (Catholic) families or communities in order to uncover plots and treasons were phenomenal. Conspirators were discovered frequently, many from noble families. The Throckmorton plot was one of the most famous and this is covered in detail throughout the book. Fascinating in its complexity and the degree of commitment and sacrifice believers were ready to make, uncovering it was to prove an even greater triumph.The book goes onto explore the stories, derring-do, successes and failures of many spies and traitors, how far they were willing to go (disguise, denying their identities for long periods, sacrificing family and a \u201cnormal\u201d life for little reward) and from these we also learn how disposed Walsingham and his men were to use torture to uncover secrets and plots and how brutal their interrogation methods were. Some of the spies, or intelligencers, were gentleman and even poets, others were criminals, but many were chameleons, able to shift, camouflage themselves and change with subtlety. There was William Parry, Thomas Phelippes, Gilbery Gifford, Chrales Sledd, Sir Robert Cecil, Burghley, simply to name a few (forgive my memory) - names both known and unknown to history buffs. Perhaps, for those names less familiar, it\u2019s testimony to how well they performed their roles \u2013 they disappeared not simply into the woodwork, but became lost in the pages of history and time until Alford recovers them. Uncovering the plots and deeds of desperate men, these watchers brought many to trial and death and, in doing so, ensured Elizabeth\u2019s long reign. Utilising surviving records, Alford has done an amazing job and recreated in detail a tumultuous but fascinating period. Almost akin to a Renaissance version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, I found this book fascinating, challenging (to keep track of the different names and roles), but also a wonderful insight into what occurs behind the doors, under the tables and in the shadows and whispers of a colourful and deceptively confidant queen\u2019s reign. Like an ice-berg, it was the seven-eights we didn\u2019t see that ensured the topmost part remained afloat. Alford has given us access to that which we don\u2019t normally witness and exposed the intricacy and deadly seriousness of spying in Elizabethan times. A great read for history buffs, writers, anyone who loves tales of espionage and appreciates solid research delivered in an entertaining and engaging manner. 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Libby", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3222446-libby", "userReview": "Deadly danger and intrigue, love of money, monarch and God and a bizarre cast of players make up the incredible melange that is The Watchers.

We study in Douais, Rouen and Rome, and we hide in priest-holes in the English Midlands. Alford spins the tales of Sir Francis Walsingham's vaunted spy network in the days when to be a Catholic was to live under suspicion of treason. Walsingham and his right hand man Thomas Phelippes were masters of the art of \"turning\" a spy into their service. Phelippes was as well a mathematical prodigy, a genius level cypher cracker and a fair forger. Together they patiently gathered information, studied the patterns and protected the Queen from dangers imagined and very real.The Watchers is densely packed with fascinating information. It is told from a slightly unusual point of view, as we are given sympathetic POV's of Catholic exiles, English courtiers and politicians and a motley crew of \"intelligencers.\" Alford writes smoothly and jumps us nimbly through complex plots and counterplots.

The best part of the book is in the very beginning, when the author describes a scenario where Elizabeth is assassinated and what might have happened as a result. This is the terror the government lived with. The fear that her spymasters felt becomes palpable and, as a result, I had a very good sense of why they acted as they did. The book needs editing. It's redundant in many places, repeating information about individuals, plots, and basic history. (I am fine if, say, information is repeated from one chapter to the next, but not from page to page or within the same chapter.) This is my main gripe with the book, because of all the sins for an author to commit, wasting my time is the absolute worst. Rereading the same tidbits over and over again makes me stabby.It reads as if it's cobbled together from lectures. (This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but to a minister's daughter, who grew up with sermons delivered with the slightly dramatic cadence of a university lecture, it was as if my father were reading the book to me. I doubt that's going to be an issue for most readers, but it was definitely odd.) In reality, I'd give this book 3.5 stars.

Indeed, they seem to have been born and grown up together. Beginning with a dramatic what-if episode that serves to highlight just how precarious England's situation was during the latter half of the 16th century, Alford goes on to reveal the characters that were involved in the shadowy intrigues of the day.

Modern technology may have enabled today's watchers to carry out blanket snooping, for instance, but then church records made it possible to keep tabs on the population at large long ago. If anything fundamental has changed or been added in our day it is that information collected can also be used for private commercial purposes, including by unscrupulous news media.The book is a reminder too, that the brutal sectarian violence we see in parts of the world today is nothing new either. And it has afflicted Europe, not only in a bygone age, but in very recent times. We need look no further than the Balkans or Northern Ireland, the saddest thing being that it can be perpetrated by either side, or whichever one has the upper hand. And the book is also a reminder of how religion functioned \u2013 and can still function \u2013 as a means of exercising power. It is little wonder that monarchs placed themselves at its head to maintain that they ruled by Divine right \u2013 and woe betide anyone who dared to disagree. But I feel Alford, and his editors, could have improved on their work. Firstly, I would have welcomed a brief overview of Elizabethan society in the post-feudal, early-modern period. Alford claims that spies came from all sections of society, which I find difficult to believe. The vast majority surely lived in small rural communities, engaged in agricultural labouring or subsistence farming, or were artisans struggling to make a living and lacked the education and means to engage in any such activity. Their main fears would have been harvest failure, the plague or other diseases which could spread very rapidly, and they would have been far removed from the world of those who plotted and planned, wrote encrypted reports and flitted from one side of the Channel to the other. Again and again Alford mentions that this one or that was educated at Oxford or Cambridge. What percentage of the population were they? He seems to be blinded by his own enormous research.Indeed, having done so much of it he seems to have fallen into the trap of trying to use as much as possible, leading I would say to excessive detail for the general reader as well as a good deal of repetition. Did he indeed stitch together a number of separate essays to make a book, as one person has suggested? There are many names to keep track of and I had difficulty at times remembering who was who and which side they were on \u2013 although in some cases they appear to have switched back and forth with such ease that they might not have been very clear about it themselves.My verdict, nevertheless, is that the book is worth reading for the reasons I suggested to start with and for the different perspective it does give on some aspects of Elizabethan times, including the Spanish Armada. But it could have been much better."}, {"userName": "Lyn (Readinghearts)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2124637-lyn-readinghearts", "userReview": "In The Watchers: A Secret History of the Reign of Elizabeth I Stephen Alford presents a book that satisfies both the history buff in me and the side of me that loves mystery and intrigue. Although political intrigue is not a new phenomenon, Tudor England, in particular, the Elizabethan era, had it in spades. The setting of the book is a time when religion was less about worshiping God, and more about power and the riches and control of the world that went with that power. This is no romanticized version of the paranoia and intrigue that surrounded the governments of the day. It is a excellent detailing of the methods and lengths that governments would go to protect themselves in a time when the stakes were the highest and turmoil was the norm. Alford begins the book with a look at what history might have been like if one of the supposed assassination plots against Elizabeth had succeeded. With this alternate look at history, he immediately throws the reading into the feelings of fear and conspiracy that were rampant at the time. And who could blame the Court for these feelings? In the few years after the death of Henry VIII, England had switched from Angelican, to more austere Prostestanism, back to Catholicism, and then back to Protestantism. Also in this time, a pretender to the throne, Lady Jane Grey, had been beheaded, and two monarchs, Edward and Mary, had died without an heir, and the Catholic Church had Mary Queen of Scots waiting in the wings. Enter into this miasma two of the most cunning men in Elizabeth's court, Sir Francis Walsingham and William Cecil, both trusted advisers to Elizabeth and men who would stop at nothing to protect their Queen. It is Walsingham in particular that is adept picking men that he cold \"turn\" to spying. Alford's research and discussion of the many men and varied methods used by Cecil and Walsingham to protect the Queen is well researched and presented in a manner that is easily followed by those interested in and familiar with Elizabeth and her court. He leaves nothing out, detailing the dealings of many of the eras most prolific spies and double agents and the various plots against the Queen. I was particularly fascinated by his discussion of the Throckmorten Plot and the attempts to place Mary Queen of Scots on the throne. The one drawback to this book, as to all non-fiction history books is that the detailed information can be a bit overwhelming to the casual reader. On the other hand, if you are a fan of anything Elizabethan, this book will not disappoint. I am thankful to Bloomsbury Publishing and NEtgalley for giving me the chance to read this book for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Ale", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2852082-ale", "userReview": "I became interested in Elizabethan/Tudor history through the advent of the BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall (which I still need to actually read), so when I started looking into historical accounts of life in that time, I came across a lot of recommendations for Stephen Alford's book.The Watchers is a nonfiction account of the political struggles following the rise of Elizabeth I to the English throne. A staunch Protestant, she was seen by the rest of Catholic Europe as a bastard heretic schismatic, a witch persecuting the good Catholic people of England. To an extent, she did persecute them, so I guess they weren't completely wrong. But what really fascinates Alford is the web of spies (or 'intelligencers') that Elizabeth's Privy Council manage to set up and maintain throughout her 45 year reign. From Catholic priests sent to infiltrate England through to murder conspiracies involving Mary Queen of Scots, the book follows the shadowy characters who brought all the intelligence back to England and the men who were tasked with breaking ciphers and passing laws to protect the Queen.The book's writing is fairly snappy, but Alford does have a tendency to get bogged down in details and prolong a character's 'stay' long after my relationship to them had soured. It doesn't help that a lot of the spies have aliases, which Alford uses interchangeably and which does get confusing after a while. People also drop off only to re-emerge a few chapters later; in Alford's defence, most of the time he does give gentle nudges and reminders about who they are exactly, but it did take a toll on me trying to keep everything up to date. Beyond that, there's not much more to be said. I will credit Alford for getting me interested in Tudor history (I have a number of books I'd like to pick up on the subject), but it isn't a perfect piece of nonfiction. It is, however, a good gateway into espionage in Elizabeth's time and one that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the period and methods. In a sense, this isn't a police or surveillance state as we understand it, but it is one in its infancy. The information network, the fear of retribution, the constant state of uncertainty are all things I can be deeply understanding of, because to an extent they mirror so well the way in which certain things are done in the UK today. Alford's book isn't a revelation, but it's still a cracking read."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan", "userReview": "This gets the fourth star primarily for finding a fairly original subject to write about in Elizabethan England. It is well written but I don't know that I'd have given it 4 stars otherwise. This is about the spy network that was set up by the Elizabethan government. It went through 3 top bosses over the course of Queen Elizabeth's reign with the final one continuing and actually enabling the next King, King James I of England and VI of Scotland. It was rather refreshing to have Elizabeth actually be a minor character in this story. You can tell she took an active interest but mostly she was content to leave the workings of the network to her underlings. I suppose that is a sign of a good CEO, to know when to delegate and actually do delegate it. Walsingham first started the network, under his boss, Lord Burghley (William Cecil). Then BUrghley took it over and finally his son, Robert Cecil took it over and continued it into the next reign. One of the most important things the author does is make you realize just how very precarious the Elizabethan government felt itself to be and why that wasn't just paranoia. It definitely used means that today's readers wouldn't approve of, but were acceptable back then. Note that the concept is still alive: There is some moronic senator who is screaming that we should torture the 19 year old kid who was involved in the Boston Marathon bombings to get more info. I suppose we haven't come as far as we'd like to believe in improving civilization. (Please also note I have no intention of replying to anyone arguing that we should torture the kid so don't even bother to write anything!) Another part that was of interest if a very unimportant point, was that bureaucracy was perfectly in place in Elizabethan times: Supervisors and underlings, departments, etc. That might make a moderately interesting book: tracing the development of bureaucracy through history. There might already be one since business is not one of the subjects I tend to read about. This most certainly enlarged my knowledge of Elizabethan society and government. I do definitely recommend this to anyone wanting in depth knowledge of the era."}, {"userName": "Chad", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16470541-chad", "userReview": "I feel a bit guilty. The last book I read I gave 2 stars but it really deserved 2.5 (maybe 3). This one probably deserves 3.5 and I'm giving it 4. The point to be made about this book is that it is the sort of thing that needs to be written. It's clearly meticulously researched and the author has a passion for the history. But more importantly, it reveals something about the mentality of a certain kind of person that has not changed in over 4 centuries, namely, the spy.In these Elizabethan agents, today's reader can recognize a host of characters who fit the mold of today's spies perfectly: misfits, outcasts, financial incompetents, misanthropes, liars, etc. Some are quite noble, others are low-lifes. It's an extraordinary tale. These agents of the Elizabethan state are risking their necks on the European continent in exchange, most of the time, for rather paltry sums from their directors and minders, who include senior officials with a lot at stake materially in the survival of the British monarchy. These spymasters are among England's richest subjects, but their livelihood depends on the success (and often great courage) of these shadowy commoners, faceless in history.The first half of the book is riveting and moves quickly. The second half starts to bog down a little bit. But all in all one is left with a sense of having looked directly into the minds of spies for the Tudor dynasty. Although the brutality of the punishments meted out against traitors and agents of the papacy is difficult to stomach, and unthinkable in the modern age, the mentality of the agents acting on behalf of the very state authorities doing all the torturing and slow-death executing is immediately recognizable as no different essentially than that of your average MI6 or CIA functionary of today."}, {"userName": "Roman Clodia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia", "userReview": "\"The more obsessively a state watches, the greater the dangers it perceives... balance and perspective are lost\"This is a good account of the anti-Catholic paranoia which proliferated during the reign of Elizabeth (1558-1603), and the men who simultaneously fed it, feared it and built their power upon it. At its heart sit William Cecil, Lord Burghley; and Francis Walsingham - but Alford also uncovers the spies who worked for these men (e.g. Anthony Munday, Robert Poley, the sinister Thomas Phelippes), their victims (e.g. Thomas Campion, Mary Stuart), and the major conspiracies of the reign (e.g. the Babington Plot, the Throckmorton Plot, the Ridolfi Plot).Alford has positioned this as a `popular' history book in that there is little here that is being uncovered for the first time, and rather than using footnotes, he confines his extensive primary sources to notes at the back. He keeps his commentary to a minimum but he makes some important points upfront, drawing implicit rather than explicit comparisons with other historical points at which religious groups have become demonised and made complicit with `treason'.This is a nice antidote to sweeping, idealised ideas of a golden Elizabethan age of prosperity and stability (the Queen's government was frequently near bankruptcy, a state which had important political ramifications in the troubled 1590s), and offers an insight into the way in which this period is being studied in modern academia. The increased use of torture, the forging of confessional documents, the way in which `perfectly loyal English Catholics' were imprisoned and thus alienated all serve to make this both accessible and very relevant to contemporary readers."}, {"userName": "Ben", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7882762-ben", "userReview": "How can a book about Elizabethan espionage be so dry and boring? On paper, it sounds exciting: a chronicle about the various assassination plots and coups to unseat the Queen, the tinderbox of tension between Protestants and Catholics, and the small band of spies and informers that Elizabeth entrusted (Varys on Game of Thrones might call them his \"little birds\") to infiltrate Rome and sniff out the schemes.But the book largely follows the formula, e.g.: John Smythe was a spy for Elizabeth. He went to Rome and learned about the Bathingate plot to assassinate the queen. Cardinal Blackwood and Francis Bolton were implicated in the plot and were arrested and executed. Then we read about another spy, another virtually identical plot, and another set of conspirators executed. And again, and again. It reads like a Law & Order case-of-the-week procedural, except less entertaining.Perhaps the problem is that Elizabeth is so far removed from the book. I understand that most readers know a great deal about her already, so there's no need to include an exhaustive biography. But she's present in this book about as much as Big Brother is in 1984, which is to say, only in spirit. And to me, without Elizabeth, the various spies and conspirators are just bobbing around like croutons in a thin broth that does little to satisfy the appetite."}, {"userName": "Mackay", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1196849-mackay", "userReview": "A fascinating, well written, and deeply researched book about the world of Elizabethan spies, the plots they uncovered, and the consequences of both those plots and the government's reactions thereto.  One of the aspects that made me appreciate this book most were the pains Alford took to show Elizabethan England as it was--we tend to think of it as a \"golden age,\" whereas in truth it was a ferociously uneasy age, full of uncertainty and danger. England and Elizabeth were viewed as heretical and unnatural by the rest of Catholic Europe, and were in their turn frightened of events on the continent (such as the St Bartholomew Day massacre of protestants in Paris, set in motion by the French throne, that spread throughout France, or the Duke of Alba's bloody repression of protestants in the Spanish Netherlands).  Anyway...long point shorter, Alford ably puts his story in context for readers, then tells the story with panache.  What he doesn't do is belabor the object lessons modern states should draw from a study of Elizabethan times: that much can be lost in the search for ultimate state security, and that freedom comes with a certain tacit acceptance of danger. He doesn't belabor the point, but it informs the whole of the book and makes for a richer, more thoughtful reading experience.

The book is exhaustively researched and packed with primary sources, but Alford's writing just doesn't flow. It's convoluted, unfocused, and repetitive, padded with frequent insistences of the drama and tension of sixteenth-century espionage while at the same time totally failing to capture any of that drama or tension for the reader. Alford spends pages talking up specific plots and conspiracies as major flashpoints in Elizabeth's reign, but these threats are then diffused with trivial ease, almost between sentences. In the broadest sense, Alford's framing of the narrative also falls flat: while he tries to paint the Protestant Tudor dynasty as an underdog against Catholic Europe, in practice, England's counterintelligence is so unrestricted that the danger never seems credible; the routine disregard for any right to privacy and the prevalent use of torture during the period leaves Catholic assassins and plotters woefully out of their depth. The main impression I'm left with is that Elizabeth's government endured against foreign plots less due to its own savvy spycraft and more due to the ineptitude, indecisiveness, na\u00efvet\u00e9, and logistical confusion of its enemies."}], "description": "In a Europe aflame with wars of religion and dynastic conflicts, Elizabeth I came to the throne of a realm encircled by menace. To the great Catholic powers of France and Spain, England was a heretic pariah state, a canker to be cut away for the health of the greater body of Christendom. Elizabeth's government, defending God's true Church of England and its leader, the queen, could stop at nothing to defend itself.Headed by the brilliant, enigmatic, and widely feared Sir Francis Walsingham, the Elizabethan state deployed every dark art: spies, double agents, cryptography, and torture. Delving deeply into sixteenth-century archives, Stephen Alford offers a groundbreaking, chillingly vivid depiction of Elizabethan espionage, literally recovering it from the shadows. In his company we follow Her Majesty's agents through the streets of London and Rome, and into the dank cells of the Tower. We see the world as they saw it-ever unsure who could be trusted or when the fatal knock on their own door might come.
