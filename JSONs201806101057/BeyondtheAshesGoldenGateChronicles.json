The novel continues where the first book Out Of The Ruins left off, in the months following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.San Francisco is being rebuilt, with the hope that it will rise like a phoenix from the ashes. Dr Gerald Larkspur still has a house full with his mother, cousins family and his friend Dr Robert King.Robert's sister Ruby, a young widow, has had enough of weddings in her home town. She escapes to San Francisco to help her brother in the hospital. One more woman in Gerald's home. Unknown to Ruby, she is walking straight into another lot of wedding plans.Ruby accompanies Gerald and Robert to the hospital, to help nurse the cancer patients in their pioneering new treatment. She also joins Abby (Robert's fianc\u00e9 and Gerald's cousin) in the displacement camps, helping the people made homeless by the quake.The novel deals with a great many themes including fear. Ruby has a great fear of automobiles, after her husband was killed by one, two years earlier. Gerald owns an automobile, and Ruby learns to face her fears, as she wishes to learn to drive, so that she can be in control. She equates being in control with strength and not being hurt.The theme of being in control runs throughout the novel. Ruby knows of God but does not want to place her life in His hands. She wants to literally and figuratively be in the driving seat. Gerald, as a doctor is used to being in control. Each time a patient dies, he feels a failure. He also takes control of his own life, and refuses to ask for help, as he sees it as a sign of weakness and vulnerability.Surrendering and trusting God is another theme that runs alongside the control issue. Life is hard and cannot be controlled. Surrendering and trusting God does not mean that life suddenly becomes easy, but there will be a peace in life's storms. Both Gerald and Ruby need to hand over the steering wheel of their lives to God.The theme of love runs throughout Beyond The Ashes. Ruby has loved and lost one husband, and is reluctant to open herself up to potentially more hurt. Whilst reading I was reminded of CS Lewis' words on protecting the heart - the only way to prevent a broken heart is to wrap it up and not give it to anyone, but then it will become hard and cold. The characters in the novel are anything but hard and cold. They are all open, friendly and radiating love and hospitality. I love the fact that Gerald's mother always cooks more than is needed, so that anyone can drop in for a meal. There seems to be quite a lot of action set in the kitchen or around the table, which gives the reader a warm, welcoming feeling.Ruby's dachshund Otto is very much a part of the novel, as he follows her and others around. I found it amusing that he growls at her brother Robert because he doesn't like him!As in book one, the issue of prejudice is raised. Again it is tackled with sensitivity, as Abby shows her friend is her friend, regardless of race or what others may say.I enjoyed Beyond The Ashes for many reasons - it's wonderful characters, it's godly themes and that Karen Barnett was not afraid to deal with tough issues of the day - prejudice, cancer, diphtheria, death - all sensitively tackled. Karen Barnett wrote in such a way that I really felt I was there in San Francisco in 1906/7. I am really looking forward to more books in this wonderful series."}, {"userName": "Carole Jarvis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2054668-carole-jarvis", "userReview": "Reviewed at The Power of Words: http://bit.ly/1HlnkNXI chose to read Beyond the Ashes because I had never read any of Karen Barnett's novels, and I'm very glad that I did. Readers will find a lot of realism in this story, dark themes contrasted with spiritual insight and the promise of hope - all elements that I appreciated. Although a sequel to Out of the Ruins, this story can stand alone. This historical romance, set in 1906 shortly after the San Francisco earthquake, has a lot going for it - one of the main things being the historical detail. The city was coming back stronger than ever, great losses overshadowed with new life. Karen's writing is solid and the depth of her research shows, especially when it comes to the medical knowledge in the early 1900s. From the squalor of refugee camps, to Cliff House's grandeur, to the realism of medical procedures and treatments, Karen did a great job at vividly conveying the realism of the time - even through the humor of Ruby's driving lessons!It's funny how, once Gerald opened his house up to family members in need, the number of guests keeps growing - Robert and Abby from the previous book, among others, and now Ruby, Robert's sister. The characters are well developed and very human in their weaknesses, fears and hopes, but it took a while for me to warm up to Gerald and Ruby. My favorite character was Patrick, a minister with a pastor's heart for people, who worked in the refugee camps and spread the gospel through serving people's needs. I hope we see more of him in this series.Another strength is the medical element and I found Gerald and Robert's joint X-ray research into the treatment of cancer fascinating, as they worked with \"long hours, limited funds, and dying patients.\" For me, the best parts of the novel are when Ruby and the other characters were actually working with patients, and the narrative outside of those sections often seemed a little slow. One of my favorite scenes was when Ruby read from the book of Job to the dying Dee, who commented, \"That's my God.\" I love the truthfulness of this quote: \"God doesn't always choose the easy road for us. But He always chooses the best path.\" Past experience made Ruby strive for control, fearing that God wouldn't answer her prayers for protection if she trusted Him completely - and that is something to which many of us can relate. Eventually, through Gerald's influence, Ruby realizes that her only need is God. A spiritual journey like this is what I love about Christian fiction, but I longed for more insight as to how Ruby reached that point.At times the plot seemed a little uneven, slow in places, certain things not fully explained or developed. However, the plot picked up speed toward the end. The conclusion was more abrupt than I like, but the way for book #3 is obviously paved. Gerald and Ruby still face trials and their future is uncertain - but isn't that reflective of life? I'm fully invested in their story and look forward to the next book. Recommended to fans of historical fiction.Thank you to Litfuse Publicity for providing a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Lindsey (Books for Christian Girls)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19266895-lindsey-books-for-christian-girls", "userReview": "[Her view changes near the end and starts trying to trust God (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tressa (Wishful Endings)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2253384-tressa-wishful-endings", "userReview": "Beyond the Ashes brought out lots of different emotions. It was heartfelt, sad, inspirational, humorous, and romantic. It was also full of friendships, family, sacrifice, service, and love. I loved the setting of post-earthquake San Francisco. It's not an historical setting I've read about before. It's also not one that I had thought much about until now. It was such a terrible catastrophe and yet the city dug in to rebuild, not only structurally, but also many people who never would have befriended each other or been unified in a cause were brought together. It was still a tough situation with illnesses and poor housing for so many. I also thought the x-ray research for cancer was rather interesting. I hadn't thought of the time and effort that would have gone into that, and, more importantly, the risks and opposition that would be faced for undertaking such research. I felt for these doctors and patients, as well as the old-fashioned doctors who had trouble letting go of the ways they had always known and how they must have felt threatened by young doctors and new research.Beyond all these details were these characters that I came to love. Ruby with her vivaciousness for facing her fears, speaking what's on her mind, and wanting to be in control. Abby with her calming presence and simpler wants, while also having her own passion for specific things. Robert and his dreams and friendship. Gerald for his stubbornness, humor, intellect, and open mind. I loved how Ruby and Gerald challenged, attracted, and inspired each other. They were a great couple. I also enjoyed getting to know the other characters. The romance wasn't easy in coming, nor in being resolved. Ruby and Gerald both had a tough road and some things to work through before they could find their happily-ever-after.If you enjoy Christian historical romance, then I'd definitely recommend Beyond the Ashes. The inspiration was nicely woven throughout, I loved the characters, felt immersed in the setting, and the romance was perfect. It was well worth the read.Content: CleanSource: I would like to thank Abingdon Press and Litfuse for my complimentary copy, which did not affect my review in any way."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10726512-kristen", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Iola", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164070-iola", "userReview": "here were a lot of things I liked about Beyond the Ashes. Gerald, Ruby and Patrick all came alive on the page as well-developed characters with real hopes, dreams, and fears. None of them were perfect people (although Patrick came close!). Instead, they had faults and foibles just like we all do, with Gerald being uncertain about his cancer research, and Ruby not wanting to risk her heart again. They were backed up by strong secondary characters, including Robert and Abby from Out of the Ruins. The main characters and the minor characters were all excellent, and I hope we see more of them in future books (especially Patrick).The writing was good, showing a depth of research and familiarity with early 20th Century medicine and the post-quake rebuilding of San Francisco, but without being intrusive. There were welcome flashes of humor and some seriously thought-provoking lines. I like that, when I have to stop and reread a line simply because the character says something clever or profound, like: \u201cGod doesn\u2019t owe me answers. My job is to trust.\u201d Indeed. \u201cSomewhere along the line, I discovered marriage isn\u2019t about the dress. It\u2019s about the people.\u201d Something too many people (and romance novels?) seem to forget. \u201cCutting was always the most frightening part of sewing\u2014no going back.\u201d I can relate to that!I was fascinated by the use of x-rays as a method of treating cancer, although that was a bittersweet fascination: time has shown us how dangerous x-rays and other forms of radiation can be, and we still don\u2019t have a cure for cancer over a hundred years later. And cigarettes to cure asthma? The mind boggles. I was also interested by Gerald and Robert using Novocaine: who knew it had been around for so long?The plot, however, was a little uneven. Ruby originally came to San Francisco to watch out for her younger brother, and to work in the hospital. However, she seemed to spend less and less time in the hospital as her relationship with Gerald progressed, which didn\u2019t seem like responsible nurse (or doctor) behavior. The pace slowed in the middle, then increased rapidly before reaching an abrupt end\u2014perhaps too abrupt. It felt like I\u2019d missed something.There was a minor subplot about Abby and an old friend, and I wondered why that had been included\u2014I thought the word count could have been used more profitably in showing Ruby\u2019s inner journey, or ironing out the pacing issues. For example, there were two points where references were made to weeks or months having passed with the problem (first spiritual, then romantic) having been resolved in the time skipped over, which left me feeling as though there were missing pages detailing the resolution. I like to see the character transformation, especially when it\u2019s the spiritual transformation. If a character comes to personal faith in God, I want to see the external events or inner journey which prompted that change. That, to me, is one of the strengths of Christian fiction, and I feel a little cheated if it\u2019s skipped over.Despite all that, I did enjoy Beyond the Ashes. It has excellent characters, solid writing, a strong Christian thread, plenty of conflict, and oodles of romantic tension. It\u2019s made all the more tense because Ruby is a widow and so knows all about passion in marriage, though that never steps over the line into being inappropriate (although there are a couple of potentially awkward/inappropriate scenes as Ruby is living in Gerald\u2019s house with his mother, his cousin, and her brother).While Beyond the Ashes is a sequel, it can easily be read and enjoyed as a stand-alone novel.

Bachelor Dr. Gerald Larkspur had dreams of someday filling his home with a wife and children. Since his home was not damaged by the earthquake, his home now overflows with his extended family and friends until their own homes can be rebuilt. Nurse Ruby Marshall is a young widow grieving the loss of her husband. Her doctor brother Robert invites her to move to San Francisco and stay with him. She is hoping to discover a new purpose by assisting Robert with his cancer research. However, she did not know that she would be staying with Robert in his partner's home, not their own apartment. As San Francisco is being rebuilt, many are living on the streets in tents until shelter is built to hold them. As with any disaster of this kind, the risk of disease is a great threat to all. An outbreak of a potentially deadly disease breaks out in the tent community. Ruby and the doctors must find enough medicine to treat those who have contracted the disease before more die. Keeping the sick quarantined in such conditions is a great challenge. Romance blooms even in these trying conditions. Ruby fights her feelings for Gerald, as she had vowed never to fall in love again and suffer more heartache. But her heart decides otherwise. When Gerald develops symptoms of the very disease he and Robert hope to cure, he makes Robert promise not to tell his family or Ruby. His secret doesn't stay a secret long. Should Gerald and Ruby dare to hope for a cure and do they take a chance at love despite the uncertain outcome?There is much to like about this story. Each of the secondary characters brought added depth to the story line. Ruby's pain and grief of her husbands death was clearly shown. Her moving so far from all she was used to took courage and strength. I like that she didn't shy away from the challenges she faced. Gerald and Robert made a good team in their search to treat and cure cancer. Their heartache was felt when their patient's died as was their determination to find a cure. Being a retired Oncology RN, I enjoyed reading about the medicines of 1906. I found the struggles the doctors' faced, the research and early beginning treatments of cancer to be interesting. Along with struggles and disappointments they each face, the value and importance of friendships and families is evident, hardships, trials, humor, joy, forgiveness, faith and love is woven through the story in a believable way. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. ~~I received an e-book ARC (advanced readers copy) of this book from the author through Netgalley for my honest review~~"}, {"userName": "Nicki Olsen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30069993-nicki-olsen", "userReview": "_______________________________________________*My Thoughts*Wow, wow, wow! Confession time: This cover was such a stunner, I didn't even stop to read the description before signing on for this tour. I'm not a bit sorry I did either!This was kind of a tough read for me. My dear grandmother passed away from a return battle with cancer when I was 6 months old. Though I never knew her in the sense that some of my cousins had, I've always felt that piece of me is missing. It's like a hole in your heart that you learn to live with but never quite get over. That is the reason this was so near to my heart. It was a hard thing to \"witness\" in my mind the pain and heartache of losing so many patients to the deadly disease and even harder when it came to Gerald.Another thing that made it hard to stick with...I made a mistake. Something I call a \"rookie reader\" mistake. I was reading the ebook, typed in the location to find my spot and...landed at the end pages of the book. You wouldn't think one sentence could change the entire outlook a book. It can. That one deadly sentence kept the guess out of the book but I still loved it! In my minds eye, if I essentially ruin the book for myself and still loved it, starting from the beginning should be a real treat!Ruby is my kind of girl!! This red haired girl was a can-do spitfire in her finest form! As if being a widow wasn't hard enough, in the midst of her pain, she did her best to help and to heal. One of my favorite \"strong women\"!I'm completely impressed with Karen's ability to take horrific tragedies and still show God's light at the end of the tunnel. This first work of art is my first book that I've read of Karen's but it cannot be the last because it is such a gem!____________________________________________________*My overall thoughts*Beyond the Ashes by Karen Barnett is a gem among the ashes for sure!

After losing her husband and seeing all her friends married and happy she decides to go live with Robert to free herself from all her well-meaning friends and family who want to see her remarry and to also find purpose for her life. What she did not expect was to find her brother engaged and not only living in the same house as his fianc\u00e9 but also living with his single Doctor friend.Gerald would be happy to remain a bachelor living alone in his house but due to the earthquake his home is not his own and now his friends single sister makes it even fuller. As much as he tried to ignore her he can\u2019t help but find himself attracted to her but when side effects from his research threaten his health he wonders what God has in store for him.What I liked: I really enjoyed this book. I liked all the characters. Ruby had been dealt a blow with the death of her husband and coming to live and work with her brother is a new start for her. When she starts to have feeling for Gerald she fights it because she is scared to death to lose someone else and by facing this fear she also starts to gain her faith in God again. Gerald puts all his effort into his work and research but as he and Robert lose more patience\u2019s and see possible health issues due to the x-ray machine they are using for research he starts to wonder if what he is doing is really helping people. Plus the more time he spends with Ruby the more he want a wife and family yet he worries his health could be in jeopardy. I found this very real and down to earth. The post-earthquake setting lets readers see how much changed and how the city is working to rebuild and the conditions some people had to live and work in. The family dynamics with Robert and his fianc\u00e9\u2019s upcoming wedding add some humor to the sometimes darker story.What I didn\u2019t like: The overall plot of this book was kind of sad. As much as I enjoyed it I just wanted the book to be over as I really don\u2019t enjoy reading about sickness. The ending was okay but still left me feeling somewhat sad for the characters.Overall this was an enjoyable book and a good sequel to the first book in the series.

Set in San Francisco immediately after the earthquake of 1905, Barnett spins a fascinating story of loss, love, and rebirth. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about this unique time period, and Barnett's clear descriptions highlight the history of the day.That historical setting made the story for me, but I became friends with Gerald and Ruby, too. I like the way that Gerald knew what he wanted and went after it. I appreciated his attentiveness and generosity with the people around him, too, and these traits made the story more exciting when they were directed at Ruby. She, too, worked hard to overcome past difficulties and to heal former hurts. Her strength of character and willingness to step outside of her comfort zone make her a slightly unpredictable but extremely likeable main character.The science involved in the story also makes it stand out. Gerald and his partner spend their days doing cancer research, sure that they're on the verge of curing this horrible disease. Having never thought about the history of cancer treatment, I enjoyed learning about it in such a natural and fascinating way - and the scientific explanations about x-rays and treatments added depth and detail to the story in necessary ways.

She has brought this era to life for me. I look forward to the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Victoria Brinius", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12962285-victoria-brinius", "userReview": "I just finished reading \"Beyond the Ashes\" by author Karen Barnett and I really enjoyed it.

Set in the early 1900 during the aftermath of San Francisco's big earthquake, the whole city is in a rebuilding place. Ruby has to come to terms with her loss and decide if she is willing to trust God and love again. This is book 2 in The Golden Gate Chronicles Series, but it can stand completely alone.

How do you trust when you have no power over the lives of the others - or worse, over your own?A beautiful novel about re-building your life, and also a five star reading experience.This is the second installment in the series Golden Gate Chronicles and while you can read it as a standalone novel, I would strongly suggest to read the first volume, as it is almost as good as this is!Ruby is the young widow, used to take life the face-forward way. She needs a new purpose in her life, so she travels to San Francisco destroyed by the earthquake to help there with her nursing experiences. Little does she know that her brother Robert is not living on his own, but in a full house with his colleague Dr. Gerald Larkspur and his whole family (including the fianc\u00e9e Abby, the heroine of the first installment). Ruby is at first shocked by the unexpected living arrangements, but she is fast to fall in love not with just her sister-to-be Abby, but also with the dashing young doctor (while clashing with him all the time!). But Ruby fears to experience another love, as there is no control over the course of life (as she very well knows, losing her young husband too soon) - so she pushes the equally smitten Gerald back. Or it is time to face her fears?Gerald, a solid, predictable man (or better, as he wishes to be) experiences for the first time how much a female can bring into the man\u00b4s life - both fire and gentleness, challenge and peace, love and purpose. So when Ruby finally decides to trust God about his relationship, he is over the moon. Unless the scientific research backfires at him and he faces the very dark future. This was a blast to read. The writing is top-notch with courage and maturity not often experienced in the Christian literature, while being the class act the whole time. The characters are facing the very real problems and I can relate to them very much (mainly with females here - their voices are very authentic!). The authoress doesn\u00b4t shy from elaborating the very human experiences - the tempations while being in love, the pride, the fear. And all that while gracing the pages with classy, but witty and even cheeky humour. The series is also well-researched and brings to the table at least three things I have had a very little knowledge before - the San Francisco earthquake in 1906, the cancer research and the prejudices and even crimes against the Chinese community living there. Recommended read."}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40886485-beverly", "userReview": "I enjoyed this second book in the Golden Gate Chronicles both for its historical events . . . the rebuilding of San Francisco and the use of x-ray machines and radiation in the detection and treatment of cancer . . . as well as the personal faith walks, of learning to over come fear through deeper faith. I appreciated that Barnett included little glimpses back to the first book which took place during the earth quake and in which the relationship between Robert and Abby developed. It had been quite awhile since I had read the first book, and to have natural moments of reflection through thoughts and conversation was very helpful to tie the two stories together in my mind.Looking forward to the third in the series."}, {"userName": "Julie Muenster", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36289428-julie-muenster", "userReview": "I did not find the story compelling.

From beginning to end, the characters of this book are challenged with facing their fears, while learning that conquering them brings more worth then they could ever imagine. Second chances and new beginnings start to bloom as each character learns to trust in God for the amount of time they are given. My Thoughts To be honest, I liked this story more than I thought I was going too. The writing of this story is very well researched and developed. From the scenery of San Francisco during the tragic earthquake and fire in early 1900's, and the beginnings of finding a cure for cancer in medicine. I thought that this book was going to be another historical romance, but it was more than that. It felt real, and as a reader it made the reading experience more enjoyable. I also really appreciated the way Barnett handled her characters. They were human, and as a reader I love reading about character's that have real human attributes and characteristics. It didn't seem as if the author was trying to make them appear human (hopefully that makes sense). Basically, her character's are full of strengths and weaknesses and they strive to learn what it means to live their lives dependent on God. They learn to walk by faith into the multitudes of \"what ifs?\". Gerald was a fantastic character to read. I don't know if the summary gave too much away above, but Gerald is a doctor trying to find the cure for cancer. He's already had too many patients die on him and he's starting to feel the guilt and remorse weigh heavily on him. What is even more compelling about his character is that his body starts to show signs of the certain disease he is trying to find the cure for. I won't say if he does or does not have the disease, but as the reader those passages were very interesting to read (in a good way). Ruby was a good balance for Gerald, and their connection of helping those in need gave them a good common ground. It also made them want to help each other with their own internal battles and from there feelings started to grow. Ruby at times I felt was a tad bit rash or said more things that I felt could have been a little out of character, but then she would add a comment that she wasn't \"feeling herself\" or would recognize that her actions weren't right. As a reader, I like that. Nothing is worse than reading about a character that says whatever they want and doesn't think back on those words. Also, her transformation from the first chapter to the last one was good. Fears that developed in her life started to dissipate as she began to over come her fears. One fear was that she was afraid of automobiles, so as a way to conquer that she learned to drive the very thing that gave her anxiety. It also helped bond her and Gerald, as he helped her learn to drive. It was evident that Ruby was beginning to heal from the early death of her first husband, and was growing to love the new family that her brother had made (which can be read about in the first book) and the new man who had appeared in her life. Overall, this book was really well done. From the interactions of the characters to the development of the story, Barnett treats her stories with much care and precision. Looking forward to the next one. Disclaimer: this book can be read alone!

He is still missing his heart\u2019s desire.Is it really better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all?Welcome back to 1906 San Francisco. When you have historical fiction I am right there because I enjoy history. When you mention the Great San Francisco Earthquake I am hooked. That was an epic disaster that showed the heroism of the people after the devastation as they worked together to heal and rebuild that city. Ms. Barnett gets it! Against this backdrop this time the focus is on Robert\u2019s sister Ruby. Robert, from the previous book, is doing cancer research. I had no idea that there was cancer research going on way back then. Gerald is Robert\u2019s partner in the research and is temporarily housing family and friends left homeless by the Earthquake. That\u2019s how Ruby and Gerald meet and she takes up helping him in his work. Gerald never had a wife and feels cheated. Ruby, on the other hand, is a widow and is emotionally wounded and needs to heal. These two fall in love just as Gerald finds out he, himself, has cancer. This is an emotionally satisfying story as God brings these two needy persons together to help each other, love each other and bring healing to each other. This is a story that you, simply, are not going to want to put down. Do not start this book late at night because it will cost you sleep as you will keep flipping pages as fast as you can read. Ms. Barnett does an outstanding job of bringing Ruby and Gerald to life and you really want them to heal and to succeed. I am already looking forward to the next book in this series.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from LitFuse Publicity for this review.
