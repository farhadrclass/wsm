Or at least that is what my completely lousy math brain would think. After the first volume of Blood Stain, the results of the correctness of my math abilities are yet to come.This volume is more of a super deep character study of an young woman who has been without proper work after her graduation. For a whole two years.I like the concept as I live in a country that is full of highly educated people without any possibility to get work that would even slightly be in sync with their papers. Our leading lady's situation is a little better as she had the opportunity to get jobs in all kind of fields (which are humorously tackled through) despite of being overeducated to them. In real world, it can be extremely challenging to get any work at all if you have too good papers in your pocket, which is kind of paradoxical.What is a girl to do when her family is pressuring, there is no money left and situation is getting tight? Accept a work offer from an known mad scientist, a freak. Or at least that is what the rumors say.And this is all what this volume is, showing the road to accepting a job without shedding much light to what is about to come. For some reason I really enjoyed this slow paced story that really was not a story at all, but just a moment in a character's life. More so, I enjoyed even our main character is a self-centered, neurotic woman.I do not know what is to come, but I have this sense that Blood Stain will be some old school fun that has a little creepiness in it, but a lot more of humor and a good time."}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica", "userReview": "I want you all to know I am a terrible person.As I read this, I kept thinking to myself: Self, this sounds like something written by someone for whom English is not her first language. But that couldn't be because while the author mentions her husband is named Stjepan and despite her last name being \u0160eji\u0107 (married name, probably), her first name is Linda. So I assumedshe was English/North American/Australian/some other country where the name Linda is super common and had married someone from oh, I don't know. Serbia? Romania? Somewhere where names like Stjepan \u0160eji\u0107 are super common. So, obviously, this woman is just a terribly awkward writer and that's why everything reads just a bit off.Do you see how terrible I am? I am TERRIBLE!No, but I get worse, I really do.I was looking at the art. It's appealing - pretty with that photo realism thing going on. I liked it...only...sometimes it was also off, somehow. It reminded me of a more capable version of my 19-year-old niece's art, the stuff she posts to Deviant, stuff that's still somewhat immature, almost as if there's a template to trace and color that's then digitally manipulated to make a fuller picture.I don't know how computer art works, but I know that a lot of it can be found online and that some of it is amazing and some not so much - you know, like all types of art - but that this seemed to be done at the hands of someone who is almost masterful at graphic art but...not...just...quite. But this isn't self-published, so...why the capable-and-good-but-not-great computery art style?\n(if your body angles like this when you're sprinting in heels, in the rain, you're going to fall on your face)I'm an asshole.Because guess what?This author/illustrator is Croatian, which accounts for the way language is used, and she has a presence on DeviantArt along with her husband who is known for his Sunstone webcomic. This is what they're both known for, this particular style of art.And so there I was, judging the content kind of harshly when I should have been accepting and not a jerk. I mean, everything I thought was true but, for some reason, I looked at it all from a negative perspective when, in fact, there's nothing negative at all. This is a story told by someone who is not American and doesn't have to cater to what I'm used to getting from graphic novels and who is known for the type of graphic art she produces.Don't be like me, people. Go into new things with an open mind and a gracious heart. Pretty much, I am the worst.But enough about me. Let's talk about this tale.It's fun!And irritating.This volume is exceptionally slow (again, I'm using American standards and we tend to not enjoy slow build-ups in our comix stories). It starts out \"Somewhere in the asscrack of the Mediterranean\" or something like that (that should have clued me in because what native English speaker/mainstream illustrator sets their story in the Mediterranean but then doesn't stereotype the area?) with a young woman (she's 27) who has been out of college for 2 years with only a degree in chemistry to show for it. She can't keep a job and now she's having problems even finding someone to hire her. She lives with her sister's family and their mother is in the hospital with an unnamed illness, but not one that's expected to be fatal. There's financial strain and sibling rivalry and the like.Elliot Torres is spunky and cute but, man, is she a shit. Again, I was reminded of my niece. Elly wants things because she thinks she should get them but then she hates on herself when she doesn't get them because she's such a loser. She has left several jobs because they were peopled by employees she didn't like, and has been let go from many more because she couldn't focus long enough to learn skills. Sometimes, it was just bad luck and she was fired because the employer couldn't afford to pay her. But the majority of her employment problem is her.I sided with her sister, Claire, on this one. Claire is on maternity leave and also taking care of her younger sister while Claire's husband works to pay the bills. Now, Elly should be helping out around the house, and such, but she doesn't. She plays video games. They help her think. Claire's frazzled. It's hard to have a new baby, a giant baby, and a sick mother to worry over and I so understood her situation, minus the actual infant.Finally, things come to a head and Elly decides to apply for a scientist's assistant position, one for which she's eminently qualified but that she didn't want earlier because someone at the school she used to attend told her the scientist guy was creepy. But, you gotta do what you gotta do, sometimes, and she bites the bullet, has to jump through random hoops, and makes it to the scientiest's lab/home to do her interview, as it were.End of story.So, yeah, plot spoilers? Only, not really because that's obviously what's going to happen, it's just that it probably should have happened in the first third of the book...says the impatient American who has been conditioned to believe graphic novels in this genre need to move at a certain pace.Again, people, don't be like me.Except do read this.I'm going to read the second one. I plan to be way nicer to that one."}, {"userName": "Jeannette Nikolova", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2574284-jeannette-nikolova", "userReview": "Also available on the WondrousBooks blog.\n\n*** 3.5 stars ***\n\n\"Somewhere in the asscrack of the\u00a0Mediterranean...\"\nThis was a lot of fun! Definitely not what one would expect from a title and a cover such as these, but Blood Stain is a great\u00a0parody.Elliot Torres, the main character, is in search of a job after a series of failed attempts(we see hilarious flashbacks of her previous jobs) and she stumbles upon a flier saying that a lab assistant is needed. Her future boss is a weird Frankenstein type of character, who I suppose will turn out to be a big softie.The entire book is very funny(warning: 30% of this volume is sketches and extras and is not part of the actual story), the characters are definitely comic relief and I don't think they should be taken too seriously.\u00a0Elliot herself is sometimes slightly annoying and not just slightly lazy, but so am I, so I found this even funnier.I found the artwork very interesting and different from the things I have read so far. There were attempts at focus in some of the panels, which is not the usual comic book method. Also some of the characters' bubbles were leaking\u00a0which was funny.Considering that only about 80 pages out of the entire volume are part of the story, you can assume correctly that it did not go much of anywhere, but I think the humor makes up for that and I'm definitely looking forward to the next issues."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54484913-chris", "userReview": "Blood Stain was a comic I was eager to read when I first read about it a few months ago. Thanks to Netgalley I had a chance to read the first volume. The illustrative work is beautiful, with lots of black and red to add to the dark yet funny story. The story follows Elly, a recovering-gamer who is living with her sister and her sister's family and needs to get a job to help support the household. She tries a few jobs but none of them stick. She is forced to apply for a job as an assistant to a Doctor, and she travels to his house to begin in her new role, her brain telling her she might be making a mistake due to the creepy voice of the Doctor who she'd only spoken to on the phone. The first volume ends as Elly arrives at her new job, so I was really into the story by then and wanted to see where it went. I can't wait for the second volume of this series. The humour is great, the characters are a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed the little nods to horror and fantasy culture. Really enjoyable, I recommend it for sure. 4/5"}, {"userName": "Sooraya Evans", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55944271-sooraya-evans", "userReview": "I don't know why but the first few pages immediately got me hooked.A woman in her late 20s desperately looking for a job, reluctantly accepts a suspicious opportunity.Bear in mind, this would be another lame and stupid psycho movie plot if not for her lengthy thoughts and monologues.

Her sister kept pushing her on it, and she is also right; two years without job can be pretty damaging. The Doctor looked creepy enough, but I doubt he is evil. I think he would turn out to be a generous person. There were parody jokes about Adam's Family, Gandalf, and so on. These were fun to read. Also, every work tried by Elliot was hilarious!

Elliot Torres needs a job. Money is tight, but somehow she manages to fail spectacularly at everything she tries. She's desperate for work, so desperate that, when a mad scientist needs an assistant ...The cover is a bit misleading, or at least I was expecting something more grim and bloody than I got. Not that that's a bad thing. This is funny, even a bit goofy. Honestly, it's a story that, with different art, would be right at home in an issue of Josie and the Pussycats. Some story points don't make a lot of sense, but they serve to bring characters together where they need to be. This entire volume sets things up for what promises to be an even more entertaining second volume, where Ellie gets to know the mysterious Dr. Stein.Rounding out the volume are all sorts of cool extras, where Linda Sejic reveals the Genesis of the project.

This graphic novel is about a young woman named Elliot who is having trouble finding a job and actually keeping it. She comes from a home that is struggling for money to the point where they are trying to decide which extra things they can cut from their bills, such as the internet or electricity. Elliot is pushed by her sister to find something, anything to help pay her way and so Elliot eventually gathers the courage to apply for a job with a crazy and scary mad scientist, which is nowhere near where she lives. The story continues on from there.I loved how realistic Elliot's position was, and I'm sure it's a situation many people can identify with. She works her way through many jobs, some she leaves through her own fault, but some she does genuinely try and it just doesn't work out for her. The arguing at home is done in such a realistic way and I was surprised how much this helped lead to character development in a graphic novel.The plot was really interesting and engaging too, I was hooked from the beginning. If the plot development and the character development doesn't hook you, then the art will. The pages in this book are consistently beautiful and detailed and catch your eye right from page one. As the story develops and the settings change the art gets even more wonderful.At the end of this novel you can find a bunch of bonus material which is funny and cute and just showcases more wonderful art. I loved this more than I expected and I can't wait to read the next volume.

She finds an unusual ad on a bulletin board (do people still find jobs this way?), but the phone interview seriously creeps her out. But she needs to find a job.

It's a one way ticket, so if things don't work out, what's a girl to do?It feels like a really long set up. We see the creepy doctor on the cover, and he does show up early on, but then it's a lot of backstory about Elliot and her comedy of errors with trying to hold a job. I didn't hate that stuff.

Jobs are hard to come by and her field just isn't hiring it appears as she is in dead end job after dead end job and she's just not good at any of them. When the job she was actually starting to enjoy lets her go, she decides to give the \"creepy\" Chemistry job a try. Characters: The characters are relatively decently developed. I got a good feel for Elly, as she's a loveably clumsy, down on her luck, gamer girl who majored in Chemistry. Aside from the Chem major, I can relate to Elly. I am not fond of her sister, but as we don't always enjoy every character in a novel, that's a normal thing. I look forward to seeing who this Doctor is though. I enjoyed how the dialog between the characters was shaped by the bubbles reflecting the mood of the character. If they were happy, the bubs looked happy. Angry? You get mad bubs. It's funny. Setting: Like others before me, I'm a bit confused on the setting, but I consider it to be an \"Anywhere\" type setting. Until she gets to the creepy home of course. Then it's \"Creepy Home Setting.\" The art of the GN is also beautifully done, in my opinion. The characters are gorgeous. Elly is straight beautiful and Dr. Stein is actually strangely weirdly handsome. Granted, we only get snippets of him in this volume, but still.

It\u2019s called blood stain and the creepy doctor doesn\u2019t even meet the main character Elliot until the last page. The whole comic was her complaining about how hard life is and trying to get a job which is not the impression I got from the synopsis or the cover or title. But I still liked it. The best part though, was the extras at the end when the author told a fairly personal story of her life when things weren\u2019t going great and how she got her creativity back and even went through her creative process.
