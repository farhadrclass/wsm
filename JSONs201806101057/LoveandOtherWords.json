It's indeed very hard to find a novel that will not only connect with you in an entertainment kind of way, but also emotionally when it comes down to sensible topics such as second chances at finding the honesty of the past, family lose, finding a new family for comfort, and also being with the one true person that has showed tenderness, joy, and sadness all in one bundle since the moment you have met. That's who Macy and Elliot are in this flashback of a romance story that fascinate and swoop you off your feet, making you not want to get up from whatever comfortable reading position you read in just so you find out what happens in the next chapter, and the chapter after that, and after that one, and after that one, and so on...\u27b3This romance novel is not like your any day romance novel that's for sure. With the history that Elliot and Macy have, it is that same reason that makes this novel so worth of being enamored by it in ways that one would not expect. That one mystery that makes you question \"what happened to them?\" is always there as well, drawing you to the page and their flashbacks. The contentment between Elliot and Macy is there, even after years of not seeing each other, the warmth and recognition is still there. As an advocate of romances with possessive alpha males, love at first sight, strong held friendships that lead to a romantic affair (in the good way), and finding an ending that doesn't lead you to questioning what happens next, I can declare this new CLo book a masterpiece that is no surprise to me will become a hit for many who adore their writing.\u27b3The emotional side of CLo has one hundred percent shown in this new novel, and to many may enjoy it, but it is indeed a romance that no one should pass along and forget about. It comforts you, it soothes you, it gravitates towards you to continue and enjoy the chemistry that Elliot and Macy have. The messages of the lose, the gain, and the remembrance of family is one that certainly makes you stop and think about what you truly have and the who are the people that surround and care for you. Personally, I have taken my family for granted for so many years, but with the presence of this novel I have succumbed to the realization that family will always be there, through the thick and thin, the enjoyable times and downfall times, and the confusing and understandable times, family will always be there to show us how love truly enhances in an individual.\u27b3Overall, this fictional romance novel that has gained so much of my respect this year and has become one of my favorites can officially be declared as a unique story that so many should read. Those who are fans of Christina Lauren and for those who are not but still rehash to the romance genre, Love and Other Words is a story filled with unique and unforgettable moments. Thank you to my favorite publishers at Gallery Books for providing an early copy that I will forever take advantage of re-reading over and over again. \u27b3ARC kindly provided by Gallery Books in exchange for an honest review...\u27b3Follow Me On:Blog \u2655 Instagram \u2655 Facebook \u2655 Twitter"}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30978160-meredith", "userReview": "Loved Loved Loved!!! This book is pure bliss on so many levels. Not only do we have amazing characters to love, we have amazing characters who love books and words, and their favorite books and favorite words fuel their romance! Love and Other Words is an enthralling read about friendship, first love, and broken hearts. \nI am not including a summary--just read this book! Oftentimes, I find romance novels tend to not go beyond the surface and are often just formulaic. Love and Other Words is a little formulaic, but what makes this so enjoyable is that the characters have depth. While they have their flaws, they are both likable and I loved reading about Elliot and Macy\u2019s friendship and how they came to fall in love. There is also a level of emotional intensity that I was not expecting. While there is a happy ending, there are some unexpected tragedies. I was obsessed while reading this and I had to force myself to put it down! It was a surprisingly good and satisfying escape from the dark thrillers that I normally read.

Macy and Elliot met during an open house when Macy found Elliot reading a book in a closet. Macy's father purchased this second home for them after his wife (Macy's mother) passed away. Macy and her father would go to their cabin home on weekends and spend their summers there. Since the day they first met, when she was 13 and he was 14, Macy and Elliot bonded over their love of books and became best friends who fell in love during their teenage years. They could talk about anything and shared a very close bond. Then their relationship ended, and they had not seen or spoken to each other in eleven years. Then the two meet accidentally in a coffee shop, eleven years later. and the spark is still there. There is a complication of course, isn't there always with romance books - and yes, this is a romance book and a coming of age story rolled into one -even if it is classified as something else. I enjoyed this book from the get-go even though it looks as if it took me 5 days to read. I started this book and had to finish other reading obligations but then tore through this one yesterday. This book is very easy to become absorbed in. I literally could not put this book down. I really enjoyed both characters and really rooted for them, wanting desperately to know what tore them apart eleven years ago. Love and other words is an easy fast read which sucked me in. There was a time or two while reading this book that I wanted to shake both characters - one more than the other. I enjoyed reading about their friendship when they were younger where it was evident that both wanted to be more than friends and the reader could see them flirting with the idea and watch them get close then retreat, get close, hint around at it, then retreat, until finally they became a couple and then.... READ THE BOOK!There is a bit of a reveal which I have mixed feelings about. I can't go into detail, so I won\u2019t give any spoilers away, but I thought \"you have got to be kidding me\" and \"seriously, come on\". Grrr In some ways this felt cliched but it was successful in making me feel several emotions \u2013 just as the characters felt several emotions as well.This is the type of book that can easily be read in one day! It pulls at the heartstrings and delivers! I could feel their friendship, their angst, their chemistry, the love, the heartbreak, the spark, the re-connection. While reading this book I felt as if I were on this emotional journey with Macy and Elliot.Thank you to Simon and Schuster who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest reviewSee more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "I'm not a fan of the term \"chick lit,\" because I think it's often used to downgrade a book, to connote that it shouldn't be taken seriously or it's not as well-written as \"real\" novels. But the truth is, whether you call Christina Lauren's new book, Love and Other Words, \"chick lit,\" \"women's fiction,\" or whatever, I absolutely loved it\u2014gender label be damned!!Macy and Elliot were inseparable as teenagers. Elliot's family lived next door to the house her father built for the two of them to escape to on weekends and holidays, while mourning the death of her mother. Macy and Elliot's shared love of reading, their quiet, contemplative, even sensitive nature, drew them together quickly, and cemented a friendship that was the biggest thing in their lives.But as they grew toward adulthood, their feelings blossomed. Elliot was no longer the awkward, gangly kid she used to know\u2014he was becoming a man she couldn't get out of her mind, one with whom she wanted so much more than companionship, and trading favorite words. He felt the same thing about Macy, and hated the fact that he only was able to spend time with her on weekends and holidays, when he wanted to be with her always.And on the night he finally declared his love for her, something they both felt so intensely, he wound up breaking her heart, leaving her a complete wreck. Macy never spoke to him again, never returned to the house, and left Elliot wondering how things could have changed so drastically, how he was going to live without the person he thought about every day. Macy, too, had to rebuild her life, and she coped by keeping everyone at arm's length, never letting anyone close enough to hurt her, never giving anyone a chance.Eleven years later, Macy feels like she's pulled herself together. She's a pediatric critical care resident, and she's engaged to an older, well-established man with a young daughter. Maybe there's not a lot of passion, but the sex is great, and she feels, well, secure. Isn't that enough? It seems that way until she runs into Elliot one day at a coffee shop near her hospital.\"He's my person. He's always been my person. My best friend, my confidant, probably the love of my life. And I've spent the last eleven years being angry and self-righteous. But at the end of the day, he tore a hole in us, and fate ripped it wide open.\"As Macy and Elliot try to catch up on the last 11 years, the intensity of their feelings for one another come rushing back instantly. But is she willing to throw away the security she's found for a chance to get hurt again? Would they even work as adults anyway, when so much within and between them has changed? And how can they get past what happened 11 years ago if she's not sure she can even talk about it, let alone deal with it?I thought this book was excellent\u2014every heartfelt, emotional, sexy, melodramatic second. Love and Other Words takes the story of best friends who become something more and then throws them into utter discord. You may have your suspicions about what happened but you can't understand what would necessitate not speaking to one another for so long, and building barriers around your life like Macy did.I loved these characters, even when they were being selfish, petulant, or just plain ridiculous. There is just so much heart and emotion in this book, so much love, and I couldn't get enough. I would've devoured the entire book in one day if I wasn't in the middle of my busiest time at work. I know when I pick up my Kindle while I'm sitting at traffic lights so I can squeeze in a page or two, I'm hooked.Christina Lauren, the authors (it's a pen name for two friends) of one of my favorite books from last year, Autoboyography (see my review), once again prove they're excellent storytellers who want you to feel and think and grow along with their characters. Don't worry about what genre this might fall in\u2014just call it \"great fiction,\" or even, \"lit lit.\" (See what I did there?)See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html."}, {"userName": "Nissa | Of Pens and Pages Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41356020-nissa-of-pens-and-pages-book-blog", "userReview": "5 stars!Review at Of Pens and Pages.Christina Lauren packed quite a punch with Love and Other Words. I was a complete mess when I finished it! My heart hurt, my eyes were red, and it took me a really long time to articulate my thoughts about everything I've read. I finished this in one sitting, and was just about wrecked when I read the last line. As I've said, this author duo sure knows how to pack a punch.Alternating between the past and present, Love and Other Words tells the story of Macy Sorensen and Elliot Petropoulos, two people who have found solace in a closet, and a bond through their love of words and books. Friendship blooms, and as summers pass, so does love. But love doesn't always work the way they want, and in the end, their story ends in heartache.Eleven years later, now a pediatric resident, Macy thinks her life is where she wants it to be\u2014a good job, a decent man, an uneventful life. But it all comes crashing down when she and Elliot cross paths once again. Elliot is not letting this chance slip through his fingers. Macy has always been in his heart; his feelings are just as strong, just as intense. He wants to know what happened, and he wants a second chance.\nDo you think about me?\" I asked. Now that he'd raised it, the question gnawed at me.\"Sometimes it feels like I think about you every minute,\" he whispered.\nThis book will reel you in with the beauty of first love, the mystery of Macy and Elliot's fallout, and anticipation and hope for their second chance. Just when you're floating on air from reading Macy and Elliot's growing friendship and blooming love, you get punched in the gut and your heart is wrenched out of your body. This book is a rollercoaster of emotions in beautiful prose, let me tell you.It was so heartwarming to see Macy and Elliot grow up together and become closer each day. Their past was the sweetest, one where you can't control the smile on your face when you think about it. They're friends, but so much more. These two people understood each other, empathized with one another, and stood by each other when they were young. I was fully invested in them and wanted to know what happened to make Macy leave.Aside from Macy and Elliot's relationship, we see different dynamics in the story\u2014Macy and her mother through her mother's letters, Macy and her father, Elliot and his family. Those relationships are what made Macy and Elliot who they are as people. Christina Lauren made wonderful characters, people I adore.Since the story was told in Macy's POV, we get an intimate view of her thoughts and feelings. I adore Macy and admire her for her strength and resilience. Getting inside her head was an emotional experience, but it was one I would never regret. In this story, while I loved Elliot, I loved Macy even more.This book is unlike any of Christina Lauren's works, but sometimes different does not mean it's a bad thing. This book is poignant and unforgettable, and will tug on one's heartstrings. Love and Other Words is a coming of age story of love and loss, forgiving and moving on, and of family, friends, and soulmates. It's a story of coming home.Tropes: Childhood Friends, Friends to Lovers, Neighbors, Second ChancePOV: First Person, Female POVStandalone: Yes*ARC received in exchange for an honest review.

He\u2019s my person. He\u2019s always been my person. My best friend, my confidant, probably the love of my life. And I\u2019ve spent the last eleven years being angry and self-righteous. But at the end of the day, he tore a hole in us, and fate ripped it wide open.LOVE AND OTHER WORDS is by far, different from any of the previous books I have read by Christina Lauren. I was expecting a funny and equally sexy romantic comedy but what I got was a slow building story of first love, lost love, deep sorrow, and ultimately a second chance at a once in a lifetime kind of love. I really didn\u2019t know how to feel about this book. The first half, for me, was too slow. We get the entire story told in the Heroine\u2019s, POV, and at times I wished that we could get inside the Hero\u2019s head. The traveling from past to present helped to depict the depth of the feelings the main characters had for each other. Their shared connection through their mutual love of books made the story so painfully sweet. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of the \u201dslow build\u201d, but for authors I love, I will persevere and I\u2019m so glad that I did because, by the time I got halfway through this one, I fell so hopelessly in love! This is a \u201dwait for it\u201d type of story. It sneaks up on you slowly and then before you know it, you will have tears streaming down your cheeks and be overcome by overwhelming emotions!! Macy and Elliot met when they were around twelve. After Macy\u2019s mother passed away, she and her father were beyond grief-stricken, but her mother left a journal of instructions for her father to follow in order to help him raise and care for their beloved daughter. Her mother asked that if it looked like life was getting Macy down, that her father needed to take her somewhere to get her mind off of her sorrows and bring back the light of happiness in her eyes. So Macy\u2019s dad buys a summer home about an hour\u2019s drive away from San Francisco, and it\u2019s during her first walk through her bedroom that she meets a boy with dark curly hair and soulful hazel eyes hanging out in her walk-in closet, engrossed in a book.The two hit it off from day one and over the next several years they become the best of friends. Always waiting underneath the surface are feelings deeper than friendship and no matter how badly Macy wants to move to the next level past \u201dfriends\u201d, her fear of things going wrong and losing Elliot forever, keep the two from becoming more. Elliot wants to be more so desperately but is ever the patient friend because he too couldn\u2019t imagine his life without Macy in it. Then something happens that tears them apart and eleven years go by before they come face to face again.Macy and Elliot are almost thirty and it would seem that in all the time they\u2019ve spent apart, neither have really been living their lives. They\u2019ve been merely existing. Macy is a pediatric surgeon in her first year of residency. She\u2019s engaged to a forty-two-year-old single father who she has at best, lukewarm feelings for. You will feel like shaking her when you realize that she seems to be content with a relationship that she could live with or without just as easily. The minute she and Elliot run into each other it\u2019s like she's waking up from an eleven-year coma. And it\u2019s the same for Elliot too. I wanted them to go back to what they had but the wall made up of pain and incredible hurt still seems to exist between them. I was dying to find out what had happened all those years ago to cause such a terrible rift and still had such a hold on the two of them.When everything is revealed, my heart split wide open and I had tears streaming down my face. What an emotional rollercoaster that I never expected to ride while reading a Christina Lauren book!! These two can write gut-wrenching, heartbreaking, and emotionally gripping stories just as amazing as their romantic comedies!

I'm still not sure what to do with myself. I feel like I've had my heart torn from my chest. It's been a long time since I've actually shed tears over a book, but this did it. I didn't expect it, either. I think that made it worse. In short, Elliot and Macy were childhood best friends. As they grew up, their slow burn head-over-heels love story was inevitable. Except, something happens (we aren't told what until the end) that breaks them apart, causing Macy to quite literally RUN from Elliot and start a new life elsewhere. The book starts when Macy runs into Elliot ten years later.Elliot has no idea why she ran. In his eyes, Macy broke his heart, and dropped off the planet. As they slowly reconnect, the book splits between past and present, walking us through their original love story and the current one, leading up to the moment that broke them. I almost want to give a trigger warning because what happens really hit me hard - but it would be a major spoiler. If anyone is concerned, feel free to message me (I'm a bit slow with messages but I'll do my best to keep up.) I loved the book, and I fell hard for Macy and Elliot. The story is so sweet and emotional, and I'm still recovering. The only thing that struck me odd was the plot resembled a book called \"Him\" (I can't think of the author at the moment). Both follow best friends to lovers that got broken up, only to rekindle at a wedding years later after being torn apart by a 'mystery event'. I felt like I was reading the same book, although I'll admit, this one was better and much more emotional and the 'event' literally ripped my heart out. I'm not accusing the authors of copying though - I'm sure its a common storyline - but it just felt super close to me.

He was her first real friend, her first love, her first everything. Macy met Elliot when she was 13, and he was 14. She grew up in Berkeley, & after the death of her mother, her dad bought them a cabin they could vacation at. Elliot lived next door and they became very close.

What we had felt like a rupture.\n\nI don't typically read women's fiction, unless of course it's penned by the talented duo that is Christina Lauren. Then I don't even think twice about jumping into the story. Though truth be told, while the story encompasses friendship, life and loss, the romantic element is very much at the heart of everything. So even though it wasn't the steamy romance that I'm used to from theses authors, the emotional connection that I developed to these characters and their story was more than enough to make up for it.Macy Sorensen is a woman that seemingly has her life together with a loving finance and a budding medical career. But then everything comes to a screeching halt when she bumps into the one man that she never forgot or gotten over; Elliot Petropoulos. The boy that was once her everything, her confidant, her best friend, her escape, is now a man. And while it's clear there's a reason for their ultimate rift, the reader is left to wander what could possibly happen to tear apart such a strong bond. The story is told in alternate parts past and present, truly engrossing the readers into the connection that these two develop and share from the time they're just children. You get to experience them becoming friends, to developing feelings, and ultimately falling for one another. Christina Lauren did such a phenomenal job with the development of these characters and their sweet and budding love. You don't feel like you're just reading it, you truly feel engrossed in their experience. It's beautiful, emotional, and so incredibly real. It's a coming of age sort of feel with the addition of true adult feelings in the aftermath. It was, for lack of a better word, beautiful.Elliot clearly never got over Macy, and Macy clearly never got over whatever it was that made her turn away from him. Years apart did nothing to heal the wounds or dim the love they had for each other. The story is brimming with emotion and overrunning with the rawness of their love for each other and pain of their past. It was magnificent and almost painful to read at times. It had me riveted to the pages, eager for just one more morsel to truly understand what could possibly go wrong to tear them apart.This had all the makings of an epic 5 star read for me, until the big reveal happens. Man did I struggle with my feelings about it. And while I can understand how something like that could happen in the circumstances they had, it still felt like a betrayal to everything I had learned about these characters. I'd be lying if I said a part of me didn't absolutely hate it. Because I did. I hated it and it ripped my heart apart at the same time. But after sitting on my rating and review for over a week, I decided that I can't discount everything else this book made me feel, including the ultimate reveal of the truth. I may have hated it, but it also made me feel. It made me feel right along with the characters, and even though a part of me can't help but still feel like it was in part unnecessarily OTT, I get it. I truly do.Love and Other Words was a beautifully crafted coming of age story and second chance romance. It was emotional and all encompassing. It made you feel everything. So much of it. And it left a bit of a gaping hole in your heart at the end, even while mending bits and pieces of it. I hated it and I loved it, and I still can't stop thinking about it.ARC courtesy of publisher in exchange for an honest reviewFind me on:"}, {"userName": "Rachel Reads Ravenously", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-reads-ravenously", "userReview": "4 stars It\u2019s been about two weeks since I finished reading this book and I am still having trouble wrapping my mind about how I feel about it. First off I wanted to address the genre label it\u2019s been given of \u201cwomen\u2019s fiction\u201d. No. Just no. This was a romance through and through. Maybe those in charge want to market CL to a new audience and that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019ve had friends who\u2019ve told me they love these authors but don\u2019t want to read this book because it\u2019s women\u2019s fiction. Ladies, you have nothing to fear! Ignore the label and read on!From the moment I opened up this book, I was in love with it. This was a stay up until 4 am (yes, you read that right. FOUR FRIGGIN AM) and sob your guts out kind of book. It\u2019s so beyond compelling, I couldn\u2019t put the damn kindle down! Second chance romance is my trope, I\u2019ll read anything with that label. Christina Lauren did a wonderful job with it, I fell in love with Macy and Elliott and felt the ups and downs of their relationship, from the past when they fell in love as teens to the present day when they reconnect.This was a 5 star read for me\u2026\u2026 up until the very end. I cannot say exactly what happened as it gives away spoilers, and I do not give away spoilers. I will just say something happened that felt so completely out of character for one of the characters, and it really didn\u2019t settle right. So much so that two weeks later I still have massive issues with it, even though it didn\u2019t bother other people (and I would know, I have been PMing friends who read this like crazy). That being said, my issue with what happened did take away my overall enjoyment of the story and almost kind of marred what I had already read and loved and somewhat ruined it for me. But since this was a 4am-er and made me cry, I am settling with a four star rating. I do think many readers will not have the same issues I had with the book and will love it, so I encourage you if you\u2019re curious to go ahead and read it.This is the angsty, emotional book from Christina Lauren that will break your heart into a million pieces. If that intrigues you even a little bit, I recommend you read this book. ARC provided by the publisher via netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

Two of my criteria are a guaranteed happy ending and romance or at least a love story. That's just how I roll. So I was beyond excited and ecstatic when I received a galley from the publisher, but I also was nervous. I shouldn't have been, but it feels wrong if I didn't at least mention it. Now, for the last three days, I lived for coming home after work to pick up Love and Other Words. I can hardly describe the way this book made me feel.This story is about the past and the present.The past covers the teenage years of Macy and Elliot, and I don't think I've read anything more beautiful than their story. It was absolutely tender, deeply emotional, and incredibly touching. It was beyond beautiful. A slow burn relationship between Macy and Elliot that started as friendship, and gradually became all consuming. They were each other's EVERYTHING. How much they meant to each other was easily comprehensible. Their feelings were palpable, and with each word undeniable.Like I said, it was BEAUTIFUL.The present describes a chance encounter and ultimately gives the couple a second chance. I morned for what they lost, but also cheered with every new encounter.For me what made this book outstanding and an absolute MUST read, is Elliot's bone deep love for Macy. When he talked, I swooned. Even as a teenager, I was already enamored with him. And as an adult he was just - WOW!!! Macy and Elliot were a couple that belonged together. They understood each other better than anyone else. They were yin and yang, the other half, the missing piece. Soulmates.What I liked the most about this story, was the slow build up. The slow burn. There was this amazing relationship that developed in front of my eyes, and I felt like I was part of it. Macy and Elliot didn't rush into anything. They knew what they meant to each other, and slowly built on that foundation, to become MORE.I was literally blown away by this story. I couldn't believe what I was reading, and each day, \u00a0I was almost vibrating deliriously in anticipation.If you love a great love story. A story that is so much more. \u00a0An epic tale about love, loss and forgiveness. A love that conquers all, by touching hearts and minds. In retrospect I didn't really have a choice at all. By opening this book I turned my heart over into the talented hands of the authors, and I didn't regret it one second.What an amazing book, worthy of all the stars!!\u2735 \u2726 \u2737 \u272b \u2737 \u2726 \u2727 \u2735 \u2727 \u2735 \u2726 \u2737 \u272b \u2737 \u2726 \u2727 \u2735 \u2727 \u2735 \u2726 \u2737 \u272b \u2737 \u2726 \u2727 \u2735 \u2727 \u2735 If you want to chat with me about books, find me on Instagram For more of my reviews:My Blog: Book Twins ReviewsFacebook Blog PageTwitterSubscribe to Blog"}, {"userName": "Pavlina Read more sleep less blog\u2764\u2764  ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603203-pavlina-read-more-sleep-less-blog", "userReview": "Live amazon https://www.amazon.com/Love-Other-Wor...\u2b50\ufe0f5 stars \u2b50\ufe0fThis was absolutely fantastic, I loved it so much!The story line is brilliant and unique, this story is based in the past and present and the way it's told is fantastic!I loved every moment of this book!I loved the slow build and even though it's not my favorite style in books in this one was perfect!

They publish a book, I'm reading it. No matter the genre, no matter the blurb, no matter what, really.I love their writing and pretty much loved all the characters carved out by the literary duo.When I first heard about Love and Other Words I was over the moon, I had just finished Roomies and needed my next \nCLo\n fix.Woman's fiction is not a genre I'm often turning to, but I believed Christina Lauren writing woman fiction would just be as interesting character and plot wise only with muted steam. Low key on the sexy times but with enough romantic elements to make it worth my romance reader heart while. In that aspect I'm glad to report I wasn't disappointed!Told alternatively between past and present, Love and Other Words remarkably portrays the unique and touching connection between Macy Sorensen and Elliot Petropoulos.\n\nI never got to fall out of love. I just had to move on.\n\nI started this book loving every word, every detail, all the small features making Christina Lauren's characters unique.\n\nEvery inch of your skin I made diligently; months I slaved over you. You are my masterpiece. I miss you. I love you.\n\nMacy's letters from her mother. Macy's relationship with her dad. Macy's point of view, every single peculiarity, curiosity of her teenage mind. She was a lovely character to discover, to read about and it took very little time for me to fall in love with her. I want to put an emphasis on how much I adored the story Christina Lauren created for her. Her upbringing, her mom, her dad\u2026 It was a beautiful thing to read.\n\nI remember the way he would hug her when he got home from work. He would wrap his arms all the way around her shoulders, press his face into her hair while his body curved over hers. His arms became a set of parentheses bracketing the sweetest secret phrase.\n\nPresent time, the \"now\" Macy is a brilliant new pediatric resident, and shares a comfortable and convenient but overall unhappy relationship with Sean.One day she has the shock of her life when she meets again with Elliot. The one.Any contact between her and Elliot, her best friend from \"Then\" has been severed eleven years ago and we have no idea why.With a painstaking attention to details, Christina Lauren takes us on an excruciating journey through past and present and illustrates one of the sweetest tale of friendship I've had the pleasure to read. To give you an idea of the level of cuteness and the attachement I started to develop for the characters, I had \"My Girl\" vibes reading about Elliot and Macy's tender bonding. I needed this book to never end and I wanted to crawl in it and never leave.Painfully aware the back and forth between past and present was only slowly bringing heartache in its wake, I couldn't help but read voraciously, lovingly, and with complete wonder every little idiosyncrasies, any small detail, whatever scraps of memories once shared by Macy and Elliot, the very fine points of their significant link. The core of their balance. The past POV reeled me in, I wanted to stay in the past and bask in this feeling of love and innocence, of first times, of perfect summers and discoveries.But also I wanted, needed to know what had happened to make Macy and Elliot's world implode, to lead them apart and push Macy to choose conveniency and safety over love and happiness. The present POV felt dull and tasteless, but held hope when Macy accepted to give her relationship with Elliot a chance to start over. To be friends again.Romance, emotional turmoil, loss, friendship and soul searing connections. This book had everything and until 80% I was sure of one thing, this was going to be a 5 stars read.Until we finally learn the cause behind all the hurt. The reason leading soulmates apart for over a decade of time. I honestly had no tangible idea in mind, I could only speculate but any reason I came up with felt... impossibly lame. Whatever had caused them to grow apart must have been huge, that was the only possibility in my mind. And I guess here lies my disappointment. I came to expect something different, something extraordinary, something as original as the rest of the story.The primary reason felt so... clich\u00e9. Absurd and so out of character for Elliot.It's hard to explain without giving away any spoilers. Let's say it felt inadequate in regard to how special both Elliot and Macy treated each other. It felt so mundane suddenly. It made characters I had put so much esteem into, fall hard from their pedestal.And then I felt such disappointment from the authors for taking the easy way out about this one fateful night. It felt so different and held so much contrast in comparison to the amount and care for small details delivered throughout the story, to keep whatever led to this one night mistake pretty vague and surrounded in shadows. Overlooked.To me, this whole story stopped rather abruptly and ended in such an anticlimactic manner when all the building leading to it had been fascinating and spectacular.I would still highly recommend Love and Other Words, I know many readers didn't share my qualms regarding the ending, so it could be my own issue. In any case, the characters, the storyline and the writing deserve my highest praise. Christina Lauren proved once again how talented they are by delivering a tenderly poignant and moving story.I received an Advance Review Copy\nMore reviews and book talk at : \n\nYou can find me here too \u261e"}, {"userName": "Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19949830-taylor", "userReview": "Happy Book Birthday to CL's newest addition to the family! 3.75 out of 5 Stars. So here's the thing: I love Christina Lauren. Ever since I devoured Roomies (yeah, I know, I'm late to the party...), I've been a full-fledged fan. So you can imagine my overjoyed reaction when I discovered I'd won a Goodreads giveaway for an ARC of their newest novel!!! Serious levels of fangirling, y'all! Moving on...This book charmed me from the start and I instantly fell for our two leads. The story was engaging and actually flowed well between the bursts of past and present. It had everything I wanted: humor, some serious slow burning, steam, butterflies, and emotions worthy of tissues. My only flaw that kept it from reaching a higher rating, was that Elliot's portion of the \"what happened that night\" felt really glossed over. I get that it wasn't really supposed to be about that. But I still have a big issue with that and I was only the reader. So rushing past it to get to the bigger reveal and ending just left me feeling torn. I don't feel like I got the resolution I wanted nor did I get to understand the full effect that night had on him. I'm not sure if it was a page-count issues or something else, but I was so invested in this world I would have hung on longer to get the answers I was left seeking. I'm going to dissect these thoughts and work out a full RTC. Thanks again to Goodreads and Gallery Books for the book!

I am a hot mess right now. I\u2019m talking about ALL the feels, ya\u2019ll. Love and Other Words is an adult contemporary romance that is equal parts coming of age, friends becoming lovers, loss and heartache, and second chance romance\u2014all combined in one potent fictional cocktail. It is 100% amazing!You know you have a winner on your hands when you lose sight of the fact that you\u2019re reading fiction because the story seems so real. The intricacies of the plot, as well as the complexity of the characters and their interactions with one another, make the story entirely absorbing and believable. I could not read the pages fast enough.The fact that Elliott and Macy are fellow bibliophiles makes them kindred spirits. However, I have no words to describe my level of adoration of them. I can say the tale of their meeting as awkward tweens, followed by their transition to best friends and then to high school loves, is just as fascinating as the mystery of their fall-out, decade-long separation, and subsequent reunion. Sporadic flashbacks in books can be a distraction if not handled with care. In this case, the timelines are purposeful and orderly; each chapter alternates between \u201cnow\u201d and \u201cthen.\u201d It creates a sense of perfect clarity and honesty to the depth of Macy and Elliott\u2019s relationship. I can\u2019t imagine the story unfolding any other way.The writing duo of Christina Lauren has truly outdone themselves with this tender and deeply moving romance.

The story is told in alternating timelines between Then and Now. Usually I am not a fan of dual timelines, because I never find the past as interesting as the present. But in this case this format worked really well. I was mesmerized by Macy's younger years (the past starts 15 years before and goes until 11 years before). The past was leading us to a dramatic event that happened on New Year's Eve eleven years before. I absolutely could not wait to get to that time period.

Although their memories are obscured by the agony of what happened that night so many years ago, Elliot will come to understand the truth behind Macy\u2019s decade-long silence, and will have to overcome the past and himself to revive her faith in the possibility of an all-consuming love.", "title": "Love and Other Words", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36206591-love-and-other-words", "average": 4.29, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1519633303l/36206591.jpg", "reviews": 860, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6556689.Christina_Lauren", "name": "Christina Lauren"}], "type": ["Romance", "Contemporary", "Romance", "Fiction", "Womens Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36206591-love-and-other-words", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36206545-love-and-other-words", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36228521-love-and-other-words", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36219719-love-and-other-words", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36206669-love-and-other-words", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16102004-beautiful-bastard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16117506-beautiful-stranger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17831614-beautiful-player", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17831616-beautiful-bitch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18775297-sweet-filthy-boy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26813208-thirty-five-and-a-half-conspiracies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489452-thirty-one-and-a-half-regrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198652-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29339972-thirty-six-and-a-half-motives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23263614-thirty-three-and-a-half-shenanigans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40199170-thirty-and-a-half-excuses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments"]}
