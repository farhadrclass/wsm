I couldn't believe my eyes and felt especially stupid when realization hit me: I must have been living under a rock in a God-forsaken place, as never before had I heard of this book:Of course, as soon as I realized that I had to have this book, another realization hit bullseye: remember that God-forsaken place, the one where I lived under a rock? Yes, this book is not available anywhere in Bulgaria. This is where frustration got the better of me...But I said to myself: \"Fear not, Tina, for you have the power of the Internets and the credit card, and have been given upon birth the gift of patience--you shall order this book online from a country where Tim Burton's books actually exist!\".

So, I was kind of interested in his writings. It wasn't a big surprise to find out that the level of awesome weirdness was the same. The characteristic Burton mixture of darkness and uncomfortable tenderness. I mean, he wrote some really freaky poems (technically, not that great, and that is a charming plus) but with such sweetness and sensibility that you feel touched. Well, most of the times, just sad. It is written in a way that seems to be funny, and for some people, this is a book that includes some weird poems that made them laugh and that's it. But after a while, its melancholic humor kicks in, and you just feel bad for most of the characters. And related (I know I did). I wanted to help them, to adopt them and bring them home and have picnics everyday and dance under a rainbow and clean the house while a couple of birds make their beds. However, this is a Burton universe. And from a certain point of view, it's not that different from our real world.Besides the poems, Burton also drew some lovely cartoons (still, not appropriate for children...). If you're going to read about a boy with nails in his eyes, it is nice to see a detailed picture of that, right? Same thing with a girl with many eyes. Imagine the flood she'd cause if you ever make her cry. There are poems like The Girl Who Turned into a Bed, Sue and Jimmy, the Hideous Penguin Boy that made me smile with a feeling of \"what a piece of rare work this guy is\". And others like The Melancholy death of Oyster Boy that almost made me cry. Voodoo girl, funny with a heartbreaking ending line. Anchor baby, simply tragic. Oh, Melonhead! You have to read this good advice.MelonheadThere once was a morose melonhead,who sat there all dayand wished he were dead.But you should be carefulabout the things that you wish.Because the last thing he heardwas a deafening squish.Nice, huh.Rare, isolated creatures, kids that doesn't fit normal standards and are rejected by their parents and laughed at by their neighbors, strange people with odd problems. This book is about all the weirdos that are far more interesting than any other regular, normal people around. Like, a girl with only two eyes, for instance. Pff, boring.I loved it. Like any other book that seems simply written but contains complex ideas, forgotten values and familiar feelings.Oct 26, 13* Also on my blog.* Photo credit: Picture from The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories by Tim Burton."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "A short collection of macabre poems, illustrated like a children's book, but aimed more at the YA market, and delightful for dark-thinking adults as well. There are lots of gory things about eyes, stories of non-human children (toxic, half robot, half oyster etc) and a most inappropriate present from Santa. Occasionally the rhythm doesn't quite work at the first attempt, but even so, it's great fun. It is strongly reminiscent of Hilaire Belloc's Cautionary Tales for Children (my review HERE), but VERY obviously the work of Tim Burton.

I didn't want to simply read, \nI NEDDED to read\n. I felt a need to clear the voices of Mrs. Dalloway from my mind. The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories, was the perfect book to do so. This is a collection of grim short poems/stories depicting the lives and misfortunes of a group of sympathetic outcasts as they try to find their place in the world -- often with tragic results.A stick boy finds himself engulfed in flames when he falls in love with the wrong kind of girl, a voodoo doll is cursed to be forever alone because of the pins sticking out from her heart, a depressed melonhead discovers he should be careful with what he wishes for, and Roy, known as \u2018toxic boy\u2019, learns he cannot coexist with fresh, clean air.Angst and a sense of \u2018not really belonging here\u2019 are a given throughout the poems in an homage to adolescence, and even though the content of some of them is quite dark it is difficult not to empathize with the protagonists.The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories is macabre, disturbing, funny and heartwarming all at the same time. It\u2019s Tim Burton.

I don't know why but for some reason I have always held Burton's creativity on par with Neil Gaiman's, though their style are very dissimilar, but both have distinct styles, that's almost as important as talent. I feel these little stories about grotesque beauty, and what a beauty it was, were full of metaphors, heavy with symbolism. Too many hidden meanings here to be casual, Burton was trying tell us something. In so few words and splashes from his mind, he did rather well. I went into this fully expecting weird quirkiness, maybe little bit of creepy gothicness, but I found most of the stories to be very twisted darkly so, which I end up enjoying anyways. There was a lot of sexual innuendo, more so than in his films, that did surprise me. But I like it when I am surprised. OK, so let's break it down, shall we? Stick Boy and Match Girl was very sweet, but in a Tim Burton fashion. Staring Girl was downright creepy, brrr. Stain Boy and his power was hilarious. OK now, the titular Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy, Jesus that was something else, quite an impact. Wow. It was definitely multilayered, with myriad themes and that ending, it's all about the endings, isn't it R\u00f0hisha? It had a good beginning with these words ( he proposed in the dunes, they wed by the sea) and a good, righteous end. Stain Boy again, haha. The Girl Who Turned into a Bed, well! Roy the Toxic Boy, how ironic. James, my personal favorite but made me said Whattt aloud. Mummy Boy was like a twisted WALL-E. But my absolute favorite was the Anchor Baby, because mermaids and watery stuff, it was so poignant and it had a proper satisfying finish, it was fair like chaos, this was definitely a social commentary. Junk Girl was very meaningful. All these stories strange but good. Tim Burton's stories have always been about the lonely hearts, the misfits, about isolation. Those who shun the world and are often rejected by it. Those distorted monsters, my heroes. I think all his work is basically a retelling of Frankenstein's monster and the need to separate from others' reality, about the misunderstood. I feel like he's trying to find a cure for the sickness of being alive and assuage the hysteria of living in this world. I have always cherished his movies, but his vision transcends even here to the written form as well. I feel like I know him a little better for it, after reading this collection. Is it devious of me to enjoy all this weird craziness and all this misery? But it's so beautiful, she's so beautiful. Do you know you are fake? In the end all I can say is this.

Meanwhile his parents, unmindful of their offspring\u2019s existential crisis, are having some problems of their own--specifically, problems in bed. Recall the long-standing reputation of oysters as powerful aphrodisiacs and you get a clue as to where Oyster Boy\u2019s story is probably headed. Indeed, the circumstances surrounding the untimely demise of Oyster Boy, one of the many bizarre characters in The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories, is nothing if not melancholy. The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories is a collection of poems written by filmmaker Tim Burton. The poems, all 23 of them, are about an unlikely assortment of extraordinary children. Products as they are of the warped imagination of the famous director of Edward Scissorhands, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd, and nearly everything else Johnny Depp starred in as an oddball, they are extraordinary not because they possess above-average strength and intelligence but because they have freakish appearances and sorrowful encounters with fate. A sampling of the titles in this collection yields funny-until-you-realize-they're-not eponymous characters, like The Boy with Nails in His Eyes, The Girl Who Turned Into a Bed, and Melonhead. Mummy Boy, \u201cthe result of an old pharoah's curse,\" and Robot Boy, apparently the consequence of a married woman\u2019s affair with a microwave blender, share with Oyster Boy not only the same gender (obviously) but also the same unenviable feeling of being rejected and neglected, especially by their parents. The twenty odd characters in this book (Oyster Boy and two other characters appear twice) are children who inspire sympathy not so much for their grotesque abnormalities as for the simple ways they get to accept and cope with them. Often their stories end in tragedy, which is how things turn out for Oyster Boy and Roy, The Toxic Boy, but in some cases these strange fellows appear to think, \"To heck with it!\" The cape-wearing Stain Boy, who \"can't fly around tall buildings, / or outrun a speeding train, / the only talent he seems to have / is to leave a nasty stain,\" is coolly unconcerned of his \"sky-high\" dry cleaning bill. The Pin Cushion Queen (\"When she sits alone on her throne / pins push through her spleen.\") sits alone on her throne anyway. Aside from composing the lines that narrate their not so kid-friendly stories, Burton also illustrated the plight of Oyster Boy and his miserable company in this collection. Already in the first drawing, of The Nightmare Before Christmas\u2019 Jack Skellington lookalike Stick Boy and the endearing yet deathly Match Girl, the clearly mismatched young lovers in the first story, shades of Burton\u2019s filmography and strokes guided by his fascination with the great Edward Gorey are at mischievous work. His illustrations add to the dark humor of his playful poems as well as to the intrinsic humanity of his characters, freaks and geeks who are actually--if you'll permit the poor rhyme--beautiful creatures in spite of their ugly features.

None of these stories were cheery, they all have a melancholy sadness or loneliness about them and each of the peculiar creations are misunderstood and isolated. However, the stories are wonderful and funny and entertaining to read and the illustrations just make this book a wonderful one to add to your collection.Although this looks like a children's book in design (verse + pictures usually = kids book) it's certainly got some more disturbing characters and the stories are all somewhat tragic and chaotic. I wouldn't, therefore, recommend this as a book to give to or read to kids, but I would say that the ironic beauty of these stories is certainly worth a go and I loved reading through this book.I also feel like this book has great re-readability to it and I have no doubt that I will pick this up again someday to re-read and re-experience these sad little tales. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Mair\u00e9ad (is roaming the Undying Lands)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9184362-mair-ad-is-roaming-the-undying-lands", "userReview": "\u201cSon, are you happy?

I am completely at a loss for why I liked this anywhere near as much as I did.Let's face it, if you squint right while watching The Nightmare Before Christmas, it's obvious even in Burton's finest work that the specter of Edward Gorey looms large over Burton's material; it has never been more obvious than it is here. Many of his characters even seem to have the same basic brushstrokes Gorey used in his illustrations. Which is not to say they're bad; they just look like Edward Gorey work. Not even as blurred as Bacon's famous study of Pope Pius.And the verse? Absolute doggerel. Even conceding the idea that Burton is using Gerard Manley Hopkins-esque sprung rhythm (which he's not, because sprung rhythm does, at least, HAVE a rhythm), the implementation is so amateurish that it's impossible despite the rhymes to call this anything resembling poetry.but good living Christ on a crutch, is this book funny. Morbid, twisted, insane, gut-churning (despite the pretty cartoons, folks, this is not one to buy for the kiddies; flip through the title story for a good example of why), and full of laughs. One almost gets the idea Burton was going for a place as the anti-Dr. Seuss. Little vignettes about characters who fade in and out like Dish Network reception in a typhoon, popping up unexpectedly here and there and doing exactly what you were hoping they wouldn't.If you are at all a fan of Tim Burton, this is a must-read. If you're not, you're probably going to notice the faults and not find what lies beneath them. ***"}, {"userName": "Charlotte Jones", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8943949-charlotte-jones", "userReview": "This book is full of mad ideas and sometimes disturbing themes, but overall these poems are easy to read, enjoyable and enhanced by the wonderful illustrations provided by Tim Burton.

Filmmaker Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas) tells 23 winsomely macabre stories about boys and girls who don't fit in. Their bodies are misshapen, their habits are odd, and their parents are appalled by them. But they do try hard to be human, like poor unwanted Mummy Boy, who's \"a bundle of gauze\": he goes for a walk in the park with his mummy dog. Some kids are having \"a birthday party for a Mexican girl.\" They think Mummy Boy is a pi\u00f1ata: \"They took a baseball bat and whacked open his head. Mummy Boy fell to the ground; he finally was dead. Inside of his head were no candy or prizes, just a few stray beetles of various sizes.\" For all its simple humor, The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories is a peculiarly disturbing book about the violence that children suffer. It is illustrated in pen and ink, watercolor, and crayon. The themes and imagery are at a young-adult to adult level.", "title": "\u0645\u0631\u06af \u063a\u0645\u200c\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0632 \u067e\u0633\u0631 \u0635\u062f\u0641\u06cc", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2040078._", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1274031864l/2040078.jpg", "reviews": 1755, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5773.Tim_Burton", "name": "Tim Burton"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1223932._", "name": "\u0627\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0632\u06cc"}], "type": ["Poetry", "Fiction", "Short Stories", "Fantasy", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2040078._", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/945817.The_Melancholy_Death_of_Oyster_Boy_Other_Stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/519112.The_Melancholy_Death_of_Oyster_Boy_and_Other_Stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12787855", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119550.La_melanc_lica_muerte_de_Chico_Ostra", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3676686", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8713848-the-melancholy-death-of-oyster-boy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4606874-a-morte-melanc-lica-do-rapaz-ostra-outras-est-rias", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119539.Tim_Burton_s_The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/955119.Burton_on_Burton", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7648998-the-art-of-tim-burton", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7097697-tim-burton-s-corpse-bride", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1505312.Tim_Burton_s_Vincent"]}
