Just before the war begins, a young woman who is confined to a wheelchair meets the love of her life. Of course he goes off to war and perishes in the trenches. Little by little, over ten years, she learns odds and ends of details of what actually happened to him.We learn right at the beginning of the novel that so many soldiers were deserting and getting self-inflicted wounds that army officers decided to make an example of five such men. Instead of shooting them by firing squad, they forced them out unarmed and bound between the French and German trenches at night in a bitter snowstorm. Her lover was one of these men. He died in a hail of bullets and a barrage of grenades or from the bitter cold. Or did he?

When it ended, I liked it a lot. Very much in fact, so it should get four stars! Right? Except that if you have been following the comments I have been making about it at diverse places at GR you will have noted that I have been annoyed, exasperated and at wits' end as I read this book! So what is going on? As I stated, the book is complicated. If you are adept at solving mysteries and love paying close attention to every detail and love unraveling clues, then this book will be perfect for you! You will give it five stars. I am not talented at this. My response was to get thoroughly annoyed. In this book just about all the characters go by numerous names. They go by their name given at birth, their military rank, where they come from and other nicknames too. I jotted down all these details and still was lost much of the time. I was always asking, \u201cWho is that?!\u201d People change identities, there are coded letters that say something completely different from what you assume and people state what they think, but that isn\u2019t always true. All of this put together annoyed me to pieces. I have already seen the movie, so I didn\u2019t even start from scratch. By the end I pretty much understood everything, but not all. To achieve that, I would have to listen to the whole thing from start to finish a second time.At the end it occurred to me that perhaps the author is indeed making a point with all this confusion, particularly with the different names and identities. The confusion is intended; it is part of the message to be imparted by the book! What is the value of a name? Is it important? Does it matter who exactly did that deed? In all the horror of war what is one individual? This book wonderfully shows the absurdity and horror of war. This is its largest merit. This is why you should read the book. I have seen the movie in French. This too proved to be a source of confusion for me. Mathilde, who is looking for her fianc\u00e9, hoping that he has survived WW1, is portrayed very differently in the French movie and in the translated audiobook. How did the author intend her to be seen? In the film she was strong and smart, but sweet and lovely too. In the book she is flippant and sarcastically funny. (She is lame due to a childhood accident.) I object to seeing her portrayed so differently. Why? Although in both she is shown as a strong, determined woman, I felt that her flippant remarks didn\u2019t jive with the setting, Picardy, France, during the first three decades of the 1900s. Here is an example: Mathilde wants to take off to follow another clue, having just that day returned home. When she suggests another trip, Sylvan responds:\u201cIt is not me that is going to squawk. Bibi (his wife) is the one who won\u2019t be pleased.\u201d Leaning forward in her chair, Mathilde murmurs insidiously and ardently, \u201cGive her a good work out tonight. Let\u2019s hear the rafters ring. She always adores you afterwards. She will be putty in our hands.  (Book two, track 4, of the audiobook)I assume you understand how Bibi was to be softened. The next day, off they go, exactly as planned, without a word from Bibi. These words are stranger still given that Mathilde has been raised for many years, almost as a daughter, in their home. Too often the language is too modern. It doesn\u2019t feel either French in character or appropriate for the 1920s. Has the book been poorly translated from French? I listened to the audiobook narrated by Isabel Keating. Has she exaggerated the flippant lines of the translation? Something has gone wrong. The atmosphere, which I so loved in the original French film, was gone from the audiobook presentation. So I will give the book three stars. If I were one who loved solving mysteries, I would have given it four. You decided if the mystery solving will entice or annoy you. I do think it very well shows what actually happens in war. It shows the total absurdity of war. It shows trench warfare at its ugliest. It showed how people were destroyed by the war. Then, at the very end, it also showed how people picked themselves up and made a new life. So it was not depressing. It did not at all end on a sour note. People are strong. All of us are, if we just decide to be. Some pick up the loose ends and go on to make a good life for themselves.Having finished the book I feel it merits four stars, but I did complain a lot, so I am giving it three. Read it rather than listen to it and read it in French if you can. You may then give it five stars. The movie was worth five stars.One more thing: the story is just too complicated for an audiobook."}, {"userName": "Epiero", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38888569-epiero", "userReview": "Una novela que narra la historia de cinco soldados arrojados a la muerte y la b\u00fasqueda de la verdad por Matilde, novia de uno de ellos.

Matilde sabe, en el fondo de su coraz\u00f3n, que su amado Manech sigue vivo, a pesar del telegrama que anunciaba que hab\u00eda ca\u00eddo en combate junto a tantos otros de sus camaradas. Una certeza que se mezcla con el horror y la indignaci\u00f3n cuando, una vez acabada la guerra, un sargento moribundo le cuenta la verdad sobre la \u00faltima vez en que vio a su novio: Manech y otros cuatro soldados, acusados de herirse a s\u00ed mismos para escapar del frente, fueron atados y abandonados en tierra de nadie.

Descubrir\u00e1 historias de amor, de culpa, de abandono, con el trasfondo siempre de la locura colectiva que llev\u00f3 a los hombres a cometer las peores atrocidades en nombre de la patria. Una conmovedora historia de amor a trav\u00e9s del tiempo, envuelta en un apasionante misterio que se va desvelando poco a poco, dejando al descubierto una tupida red de ilusiones, amor y desdicha.Comentario:\"Erase una vez cinco soldados franceses que hac\u00edan la guerra, porque as\u00ed son las cosas\". Es as\u00ed como inicia esta tr\u00e1gica, misteriosa y conmovedora historia de amor y drama compuesta de 14 cap\u00edtulos y 373 p\u00e1ginas.En la noche del s\u00e1bado 6 de enero de 1917 bajo un crudo invierno cinco soldados franceses, heridos, con las manos atadas a la espalda, exhaustos y casi sin esperanzas de sobrevivir, son v\u00edctimas de una de las m\u00e1s crueles decisiones que el ej\u00e9rcito franc\u00e9s procedi\u00f3 sobre sus propios soldados: abandonarlos a su suerte al reducido espacio comprendido entre los frentes franceses y alemanes, expuestos a una carnicer\u00eda latente. Nos encontramos en el contexto hist\u00f3rico de la Primera Guerra Mundial.Qu\u00e9 pas\u00f3 exactamente con estos cinco soldados es una inc\u00f3gnita que se vuelve obsesiva para Matilde Donnay quien se pasar\u00e1 la vida buscando por todos los medios que est\u00e9 a su alcance la verdad sobre el s\u00e1bado 6 y domingo 7 de enero de ese a\u00f1o. Ella es novia del m\u00e1s joven de los cinco desgraciados.Cada cap\u00edtulo conduce a una pista nueva para desentra\u00f1ar la verdad que busca Matilde. La novela se convierte en una especie de novela epistolar, ya que a trav\u00e9s de las cartas que se intercambia Matilde con otros personajes relacionados al asunto poco a poco se ir\u00e1 entretejiendo la historia de aquellos cinco soldados franceses, de esta manera, Matilde intentar\u00e1 armar el puzzle para entender qu\u00e9 fue lo que le pas\u00f3 a su novio en el frente de la trinchera Bingo Crep\u00fasculo.A trav\u00e9s de dichas cartas Matilde se enterar\u00e1 de la vida de los otro cuatro soldados, vidas llenas de historias de amor, amistad, traici\u00f3n, culpa, celos, soledad, que me han conmovido, haciendo a estos personajes entra\u00f1ables. Los personajes que m\u00e1s destaco son Matilde Donnay por su pasi\u00f3n y amor inquebrantable al paso del tiempo, Ese Hombre (Benoit Notre-Dame) por su inteligencia y fortaleza para conducirse ante la adversidad, Celestine Poux por su creatividad infinita para salir airoso incluso en el mism\u00edsimo infierno que es la guerra, Eskimo (Kleber) y Biscotte por su amistad y Tina Lombardi, por su rabiosa determinaci\u00f3n para hacer justicia por sus propios medios pese a arriesgar su propia vida.La obra expone el romanticismo de Matilde por buscar sin desmayo el paradero y destino de su novio alimentando sus esperanzas de encontrarle gracias al amor que siente por \u00e9l, pero tambi\u00e9n la novela revela las consecuencias devastadoras que trajo la guerra para cada una de las almas humanas que la sufrieron directa e indirectamente. La obra, claramente denuncia el sin sentido de la guerra que lo destruye todo, la memoria, los sentimientos m\u00e1s nobles, una vida de dicha, el amor.Una novela para releerse muchas veces.

Mathilde, despite her sarcasm and pig-headedness seems to inspire devotion in everyone she meets. How could you not admire someone who accomplishes as much as she does despite being in a wheelchair? How can you not admire her devotion to Manech? She would not rest until she got to the bottom of what happened to him. And the mystery of what happened to Manech and four other soldiers who were thrown into No-Man's Land by their own leaders keeps you reading on and on. There are so many different versions of what happened that Mathilde's investigation is constantly taking one step forward and two steps back. But there's a constant feeling of momentum--you know Mathilde will get to the bottom of this. As time goes on she gets closer to solving the mystery by meeting people who are closer to what finally happened to Manech.

Over the years, the protagonist gathers these snippets (often helped by her many assistants) and fits themtogether. Reading the book requires careful attention.I thought of a lecture by Bob Woodward that I attended where he discussed how he does research for his books:he does many hours of interviews and investigation,fills files with the results, and then goes backand painstakingly puts all the tiny bits together tomake something out of it.

Something seems fishy about his death so she begins to investigate. She wants to know what happened to him, and something keeps telling her that he is still alive somewhere. She soon learns of five soldiers condemned to death for self-mutilation, one of them was Manech. The reader unravels the clues along with Mathilde as she receives more and more information about her fiance's mysterious death.Honestly, I did not like this book at all. There were too many characters and unnecessary details. The whole book was very confusing and I didn't actually understand what happened until the Chapter where she talks to \"That Man\". I also did not think that this book taught me a lot about WWI. I wasn't expecting too be a history book of course, but I thought I might take something away from it. If I learned anything, it was that the people fighting in the war were not good to there soldiers. Some of them lied and some were thieves, it seems that they were not very good people. I also thought maybe it would give me a better idea of life in France at the time, but again, I was mistaken. It does not describe France from the point of view of an average French woman or even someone without bias at all, it shows France from Mathilde's perspective. Mathilde is not average at all. First of all, she is in a wheel chair so people treat her differently (and I will have to agree with her character that just because she is in a wheel chair, it doesn't mean she is any different, but not everyone in France thinks the way we do). Second, she doesn't describe France because she lives there and why would she need to show the reader something she has already seen. What I mean is, if I was writing a diary entry and I said: \"I walked into my room.\" I wouldn't describe what my room looks like. I already know what it looks like! Adding \"it was small, and my clothes were all over the floor.\" would not make any difference to me because I am the one reading it and I already know what my room looks like. The book was written for the benefit of the character, Mathilde, so therefore she does not need to give an accurate description of France because she already knows what it is like. Third, Mathilde was looking for her \"dead\" fiance. How many women had the time and the means to go and investigate the death of there loved ones? In the book there were two. One was Mathilde and the other was Angelo's lover. All of the other widows accepted the fact that there husbands were dead and had to go on with there lives because they had to support themselves and/or their children. Mathilde however, had this unlimited supply of cash to fund her investigation and she didn't have to work at al. She basically had all the time in the world and all the resources she needed at her fingertips. I feel like this was not the usual case for widowed women in France after WWI.There were too many characters, places, different perspectives, names and it was all too much to keep track of. I also did not think this was a good book to read to help me understand life after WWI. I did not like this book, and I wont recommend it to my friends. I will probably recommend the movie though. I thought the movie was much better than the book. The characters annoyed me (mostly Mathilde), but it is much easier to understand. It also provides a good visual of France at the time, and the trenches."}, {"userName": "Tempo de Ler", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10165683-tempo-de-ler", "userReview": "{Blog} http://tempodler.blogspot.pt/2012/06/...Pela forma como foi escrito, levamos muito tempo a entrar na hist\u00f3ria de Um Longo Domingo de Noivado. Esta dificuldade pode desanimar o leitor que se v\u00ea for\u00e7ado a obrigar-se a ler, de forma a avan\u00e7ar no livro. A dificuldade em associar os nomes \u00e0s personagens, especialmente entre os soldados, vem adicionar bastante \u00e0 confus\u00e3o e torna-se complicado acompanhar Japrisot. O autor n\u00e3o perde sequer muito tempo a descrever estas personagens, faz um apenas um relato apressado do passado de cada um e avan\u00e7a com a narrativa. Al\u00e9m de tudo isto, como vamos colhendo, atrav\u00e9s da investiga\u00e7\u00e3o incessante de Mathilde, diversas pistas, sendo que muitas delas acabam por se revelar nulas, temos que ter sempre presente todas estas informa\u00e7\u00f5es e fazer uma leitura atenta que, consequentemente, tende a ser cansativa.

I was so hooked on this book that when I accidentally left it my office desk drawer two nights ago, I felt positively forlorn and moped around the house all evening, such had been my anticipation for finishing it. I would defy someone to not like this book. The heroine, Mathilde, is funny, and mule-headed, and completely delightful. I loved the secondary characters as well; Japrisot's women are phenomenal and their stories weave together around those of the soldiers so beautifully and unexpectedly.

Their brutal punishment has been hushed up for more than two years when Mathilde Donnay, unable to walk since childhood, begins a quest to find out whether her fianc\u00e9, officially \"killed in the line of duty,\" might still be alive. Mathilde moves throughout the country for information about the men. She encounters many people along the way with different information as well as meeting the loved ones of the other families that the men left behind. This was a bestseller in France and is sort of a mystery, a look into the different ways one story can be told, and a look at life in France during and after the First World War. Because of the many French names I got confused sometimes and wish the characters had been more developed, especially Matilde and her fianc\u00e9, Manech.

The author's writing style was confusing to follow, as he wrote it in present tense and avoided writing conversations using quotations. The plot jumped from one point to another very quickly and with out much notice. There were also too many characters to easily keep track of. The five soldiers each have a name, nickname(s), and number, along with multiple relatives and friends who also have nicknames. It was hard to keep track of all the different relationships and the feelings behind the relationships. Much of the story was told through letters, most of which would randomly start with no introduction.I also felt that much of the plot was unrealistic. I'm not an expert on Post-WWI France, but I doubt that this young orphaned woman would have the money and connections to travel all over France whenever she wanted to. In addition, she wrote letters to and visited many people that she had never met before, then proceeded to ask them very personal questions involving their relationships with people. Almost every time, she got a detailed answer! I don't think that that many people would have shared such personal information to someone that they'd never met. One woman writes to Mathilde after being clearly asked not to by her goddaughter. Why would she write everything to Mathilde, a person she doesn't know, against the wishes of a close relative?At the same time, I thought that the plot as a whole was interesting. The mystery of the fate of the five soldiers was exciting to learn as each new clue was uncovered. I wasn't satisfied by the end, though it made sense. Watching the movie after reading the book was very helpful to understand the plot.Overall, I would recommend this book to a mystery-loving person who can keep track of multiple characters."}, {"userName": "Ninon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16595003-ninon", "userReview": "J'aime d'amour l'adaptation de ce livre en film alors en le choisissant comme lecture j'avais tr\u00e8s peur que mon avis futur sur le livre soit biais\u00e9 mais.... pas du tout !

In the movie, Mathilde has a pronounced limp from polio and is an orphan, rather than a young woman in a wheelchair from a childhood accident with rich parents who are still living. She was more whimsical in the movie too, saying things like, \"If the dog comes into my room before I'm called for supper, Manech is still alive.\" There was none of that in the book.

According to just about every eyewitness Mathilde can find, from haunted survivors to the family members of fellow condemned soldiers, Manech went mad, was tossed bound into No Man\u2019s Land and died alongside four other would-be deserters. But Mathilde searches for him anyway. I think the mystery itself suffered a little from the translation - not that the translation wasn\u2019t gorgeous, with sentences that bit and clawed, but the way the past and present merge and cross each other within pages or even paragraphs made things a little vague, a little hard to remember who was who and who knew what when. It might mildly annoy mystery fans who like to plot out every twist and turn. Fans of romance and war novels and main characters who are delightfully, determinedly obsessed will overlook it. Mathilde is one of the most unique female characters I\u2019ve come across. She\u2019s in a wheelchair but that doesn\u2019t bother her and never once hampers her quest. And she\u2019s ruthlessly, unapologetically focused on that quest - a sacrifice I thought she\u2019d made at the end was respectful and O So Noble of her, but then I remembered this is Mathilde and she doesn\u2019t give one good goddamn about being respectful or noble, she cares about finding Manech. So she made another choice altogether and what a choice it was. She is so snarky it hurts - I can only imagine what she sounds like in the original French - and so clever, and she\u2019s surrounded by a charming cast of characters who love her and will do anything for her, from the cats on up. You really don\u2019t hate anyone in this novel except maybe for the idiots who brought the world to such a senseless stupid war. And though not one page of the novel is from Manech\u2019s perspective, you so quickly want to believe the way Mathilde does, in the face of all the evidence - you *know* he\u2019s dead but you still believe. He\u2019s the ultimate symbol of innocence - young; nicknamed Cornflower by more cynical soldiers who want in their way to protect him; so unable to face the horrors of trench warfare that he retreats into a childlike, cheery sort of insanity; last seen building a snowman in the middle of a firefight. \u201cThere was still that wire ... a wire that snaked its way through all the trenches ... And Mathilde has a cheerful disposition, too. She tells herself that if this wire doesn\u2019t lead her back to her lover, that\u2019s all right, she can always use it to hang herself,\u201d but she\u2019s never one to despair for long: \u201cShe tells herself that she\u2019ll have to go on being mad all by herself.\u201d Though I was happy to go mad along with her."}, {"userName": "Benjamin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1249209-benjamin", "userReview": "Probably one of my favorite college memories is reading a little of this book everyday with gelato and espresso in between class and my shift at the computer lab.

The book opens with five soldiers trudging through the French trenches towards their death. They had been condemned to die because each of them either shot themselves in the hand or made themselves and obvious target for the Germans by raising their hands up for snipers (think Thomas in that episode of Downton Abbey). We have The Eskimo, a carpenter who has traveled the world. Six Sous an angry trade unionist who loves the Tour D'France. That Guy an orphan farmer who doesn't say much. Angel a French-Italian pimp from Marseilles. Then we have Cornflower who also goes by Manech. He's they youngest of this motley crew and also engaged to a girl back home named Mathilde. Before these five are executed a pardon arrives. However the superior officers get around this inconvenience by simply throwing the men into no-mans land with their hands tied behind their backs. It takes some time, but eventually the Germans kill all of them.Or do they? After the first chapter of the book concludes Mathilde wants to know. Mainly she just wants to grieve for her lost fianc\u00e9 and does so by trying to learn how he died. She wants a sense of closure but she also wants justice for her fianc\u00e9. As she talks directly and through letters to people who were in the trenches with Manech the mystery delves deeper.This book is a mystery although its pretty laid back. It flows as placidly as the River Somme when there isn't a battle scene being played out. Mathilde is courageous and very very analytical young women. I was surprised when it was revealed that she was crippled, yet that adds to her character. Overall she reminded me of Audrey Tautou's titular character in Amelie. Then again this book was adapted into a film by the same director as Amelie and starred Audrey Tautou.
