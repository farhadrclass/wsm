In INTERIOR DESIGNS Martha Cummings' journey is internal. Author Laurel-Rain Snow delves deep into her character\u2019s psyche, revealing her doubts, fears, beliefs, and triumphs after her divorce. With the help of her friend Maeve (everybody should have a best friend like Maeve!) she leaps out of her comfort zone. This book is more than a romance, although there are romantic elements in it. Laurel-Rain Snow's background in psychology and social work is evident in this insightful story of a woman who slowly uncovers her true self."}, {"userName": "Laurel-Rain", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1402123-laurel-rain", "userReview": "The sequel to Embrace the Whirlwind, Interior Designs offers a peek into the interior world of Martha Scott Cummings, the interior designer that was an antagonist to Amber Cushing in the first book.Will Martha discover how to change her attitudes and behaviors, while struggling as a single parent to her ten-year-old daughter?Is it possible to put the past behind and carve out a better future?Martha will find out, as she and her best friend Maeve explore their new lives."}, {"userName": " Gigi Ann", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2511429-gigi-ann", "userReview": "My Thoughts...This is the first book I've read by this author, Laurel-Rain Snow. The book \"Interior Designs\" is about girlfriends, family drama, and also an entertaining contemporary second chance at love and romance.Martha is the main character while her girlfriend Maeve, one of the other characters plays a second banana support role. These two women strengthen their bonds and learn the power of a girlfriend. We also learn how the past has shaped some of the characters and affected their present day relationships.
