I think younger children will find it too distressing, but it should be suitable for 6-7 year olds and upwards. We had the French edition lying on our coffee table for several months, and nearly everyone who visited picked it up and read it.The basic story: Otto belongs to David, a Jewish kid in 1930's Germany. His best friend is Oskar, a Gentile. One day, the SS arrive, and take away David and his family. Just before they hustle him into the truck, David gives Otto to his friend.The bear goes through various harrowing adventures. He's blown up by an Allied bomb, then found in the rubble by a black GI and taken to the US. He ends up in the window of a junk shop, and is miraculously spotted one day by Oskar, now an old man. He recognizes Otto by the distinctive ink stain on his face, resulting from an accident 60 years earlier, and immediately buys him.The story is so remarkable that the media get hold of it. That evening, a second miracle happens: there is a phone call from David. Against all the odds, he survived Auschwitz. He saw a newspaper story, and managed to track Oskar down.At the end, the two childhood friends, both bachelors, have moved in together. The final picture is typical Ungerer. They're sitting together happily in David's rather upmarket apartment. Although David is confined to a wheelchair (Auschwitz has apparently left its mark), that hasn't interfered with his ability to appreciate female beauty. The walls are covered with tasteful but extremely racy nude studies.It's just occurred to me that this isn't in fact gratuitous. Without the nudes, many adult readers would ask themselves whether Oskar and David are supposed to be gay. As it is, you can at once see that David, at least, is definitely hetero. Ungerer's clever._______________________________________I was shocked and disappointed to find that the English-language edition has censored the illustration on the last page: the sexy nudes have been replaced by anodyne landscapes. All too typical, alas."}, {"userName": "Manybooks", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks", "userReview": "I have always simply adored Tomi Ungerer as both an author and illustrator, and I also with all my heart and soul much and sweetly appreciate his Otto: The Biography of a Teddy Bear (which was, like most of Tomi Ungerer's picture books, originally seemingly published in German as Otto: Die Autobiographie eines Teddyb\u00e4ren). Both narrative and accompanying illustrations tell a sweet, emotionally gripping, poignantly satisfying, but also of course generally inherently saddening, even infuriating tale of the Holocaust, with a narrative that presents itself as realistic, sometimes humorous, truthful, and also always somewhat hopeful. And even though as an adult, I do tend to find the general storyline, the text, while evocative and horrifying also at least somewhat overly simplistic, for the purpose of introducing the horrors of the Holocaust to youg children (in a picture book format), the author has indeed more than acchieved his intended goals (although personally, I do consider some of Teddy Bear Otto's \"adventures\" in America, but especially the nasty bullying young Jasmin and by extension Otto experience, a bit gratuitous and almost tacked-on for effect, for potential added discussion and debate value).Now I have read some reviews of Otto: The Autobiography of a Teddy Bear that at times rather vociferously fault Tomi Ungerer for having presented the Holocaust as a picture book (for even exposing younger children to the Holocaust, to the horrors of the Third Reich, to what happens during times of war). And while I can to a certain point grudgingly understand and even appreciate this philosophy, I have to (and from personal experience at that) majorly disagree with this attitude, as it both seems to artificially shield children and also, more importantly, it can keep children ignorant of the Holocaust, of the horrors of the Third Reich (and in my opinion, that needs to be avoided at all cost). My own case in point, when my family immigrated from Germany to Canada in 1976 (when I was ten years old), my siblings and I had had absolute no previous information given to us about the Holocaust, neither through the adults in our lives (family members, teachers) nor via reading materials, with the both horrible and psychologically potentially damaging result that we were and especially that always a bit overly sensitive I was completely unprepared for the often vicious, vile bullying, the being constantly called a Nazi, the actual horrors of the Holocaust as they were presented to us, to me (and often basically thrown like personal accusations). And my own mother, when I decided to finally confront her as an adult with the question as to why she never taught me, taught us, about the Holocaust when we were younger still stubbornly insisted on claiming that it had been better to shield us, to leave us innocent for as long as possible (but I call that way of thinking majorly, utterly unenlightened and potentially damaging, as I would definitely have been more emotionally prepared for the bullying I experienced at age ten and less aghast at the horrors of the Holocaust if I had gently and with care been introduced to the Holocaust, to the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis as a younger child). And thus personally, I really do have precious little patience with parents, caregivers and teachers who somehow seem to think that the Holocaust should be off limits to and for the picture book crowd (as it is an attitude that does not take children seriously, and furthermore encases them in a coccoon of artificial security that does or at least has the potential of doing more harm than good).EDITED TO ADD: It has just been brought to my attention (and very much annoyingly so, I might add) that for the English language but especially for the often irrationally puritanical U.S. American market, the illustations of David's apartment have supposedly been \"sanitised\" (and that in the original German version, as well as in the French version, David has a number of paintings of female nudes gracing his walls). This salient fact alone is enough of a sad and frustrating disappointment for me to now seriously consider only three stars for this here (American) English language version of Otto: The Biography of a Teddy Bear (I am really ONLY keeping my original four star rating intact at present because I am pretty well sure that Tomi Ungerer himself most likely did NOT agree with or approve of this visual censorship, and I really do not want the overall rating to be negatively affected) and to also state with both frustration and, yes, even some righteous anger that especially America really does need to grow up and realise that a state of undress is NOT automatically sexuality, that nudity is healthy and that it is actually profoundly unhealthy and potentially damaging to children for the American morality police, for censors and so called do-gooders to keep removing referals to nakedness and even minor depictions of the same from children's literature (including books for the picture book crowd). Of course, considering that many Americans, many American \"parents\" are so massively morally allergic to and offended by nudity (and even a casual depiction, a few innocent images of the same) that they would likely refuse to even consider, refuse to purchase a picture book featuring this, the publisher, Phaidon, might have well considered that its proverbial hands were bound and tied, that it basically needed to remove the images of the nudes on David's apartment walls if it was going to be able to successfully market and sell Otto: The Autobiography of a Teddy Bear in the U.S.A. especially (and also not be facing irate parents and special interest groups rabidly baying with calls demanding boycotts and/or official investigations for supposed paedopilia). And this is not meant in any way as an acceptance on my part of the sad fact that these really in all ways innocent images were likely deliberately redacted and removed, just bit of a point of consideration as to why it might have happened and yes, also some potential understanding of the reasons why Phaidon might have decided to replace the pictures of female nudes on David's apartment walls with a more standard, more innocent and less potentially issue-heavy pictorial offerings (although, in fact, there are no or rather there should be no issues with David having pictures of female nudes on his wall, sigh).And I guess I had also better see about getting my hands on the German and the French versions of Otto: The Biography of a Teddy Bear, to not only verify the validity of the above information regarding the likely illustrative changes, the illustrative censoring, but also and yes much more importantly, to equally check the German and the French narratives to see if there are perhaps also instances of deliberate narrative omissions, censorship and changes between Tomi Ungerer's original texts and the anonymous English language language translation published by Phaidon (which would in my humble opinion be much more problematic an issue than ANY censoring of the accompanying illustrations could ever be, and which would, indeed, and more than likely make me to immediately change my now four star rating to three stars).And a few weeks later now and yes, I have read BOTH the German AND the French language editions of Otto, and the pictures in David's apartment have, indeed, been sanitised in the English language version published by Phaidon (the original nudes have been replaced with some standard and mundane portraits and landscapes). Not only is that both UNACCEPTABLE and puritanically silly, I also have to wonder and with some anger why illustrations of dead and dying soldiers are considered acceptable images for young children to see, but images of nudity, of artistic nakedness are somehow NOT appropriate. But even more problematic at least for me is the fact that in the both the German original and in the French edition, David and his parents are actually described as having been sent to a Concentration Camp, while in the English language edition, this sadness and tragic fact has been muted and softened to simply state that they were sent to a terrible type of prison (come on, the translator should be calling the latter what it was, a Concentration Camp, a Death Camp, especially since that is what both the German and the French texts also and abundantly clearly state). And now, and most definitely, my original four star rating for the English (the American) version of Otto needs to be lowered to but at most three stars, as I am really and massively annoyed and increasingly angered at these silly and in all ways child-unfriendly, nanny-state like changes (and frankly, I think I am actually being quite generous here because if I went by my personal feelings alone, a two star rating would be the end result)."}, {"userName": "Kenny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1642452-kenny", "userReview": "Otto, is a teddy bear that begins his life as a gift for David, a young German Jewish boy; Otto becomes a trusted friend of David and his best friend, Oskar and a willing participant in their childhood pranks. Soon, David and his family are sent away to a concentration camp, and Otto is entrusted to Oskar\u2019s care. The war takes its toll on Oskar\u2019s city and family, and soon Otto is lost. Otto finds himself with a new companion, a U.S. soldier. Otto travels to America, experiencing many different adventures and ultimately landing in an antique store where miraculously he is rediscovered by Oskar and ultimately reunited with David many, many years later.This brilliant book is formatted as a picture book and therefore looks as if it is meant for young readers, but it is not a book for young children. The accompanying illustrations are dark, detailed and somewhat gory pictures of dead soldiers bleeding next to their machine guns, hands sticking out from the rubble of destroyed buildings and fires burning all around. Otto arrives in America to a hero\u2019s welcome, but quickly lands in the hands of thugs and is thrown in the garbage. The bleakness of the illustrations continues even with the reunion of the friends.Otto is a very realistic Holocaust story, and while told from the viewpoint of a teddy bear, it leaves no detail unrevealed. This is the first book I have read by Tomi Ungerer. It will not be my last. I am excited to go the Ungerer journey."}, {"userName": "notgettingenough ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2658311-notgettingenough", "userReview": "Camp Concentration by Disch and Otto by Tom Ungererhttp://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...A pair made in a sort of hell, I guess, birthday books read back to back. I don\u2019t understand why Otto is badly written, when the author is obviously capable of writing good text in English. If you want to write some sort of nightmare for children \u2013 even worse, a nightmare that really happened \u2013 one has to be very careful, I imagine and this isn\u2019t. It uses badly cliched English that is inappropriate for any readership, let alone kids. He describes the bombing of his German town thus: \u2018Among the ruins and the fires lay innocent victims.\u2019 What on earth does that mean? That some of the civilians bombed in German towns weren\u2019t innocent victims? Does he mean anybody killed by these bombs were innocent victims? One could conceive of an argument along the lines of all the innocent victims being in concentrations camps, after all \u2013 two words ignored by this children\u2019s book. Then there is the general dilemma of writing about such a topic for children: I am uneasy about his treatment, really uneasy about picking such a theme and coming up with a happy ending. Finally, the language is stilted, quite unattractive to read. I don\u2019t understand why a child would want to read it. Nor, as an adult, would I consider giving it to a child. \u2018Mummy why did Oskar let those men take his friend away? Why didn\u2019t his mother help? Why didn\u2019t\u2026.If somebody wanted to take my friend away, would you stop them, Mummy?\u2019 \u2018Well, no, I wouldn\u2019t, Oskar. It\u2019s better just to watch when that happens and be glad it isn\u2019t happening to you\u2019. Honestly. The more I think about this book, the more I am really unhappy about it.The pictures are nice. Unfortunately Camp Concentration has no pictures. It does, however, avoid avoiding the words concentration camp. One can only assume, knowing that Disch considers himself too clever for words \u2013 no, not too clever for words, his books are full of his cleverness, little jokes for his friends and so on, exactly the sort of thing I object to when reading clever dicks \u2013 one can only assume that moving the word order is a play on his own camp ways as they are expressed in this book, much as it may have other rationales as well. It was explained to me after I finished reading this \u2013 and I must confess that my reading became cursory after a while \u2013 that I had missed all the clues. Was I supposed to know there were clues and that I was reading a mystery book? If I was supposed to realise this, it was badly communicated to me. If I wasn\u2019t supposed to realise it, we are left with a denouement which is rather like one of those who-dun-its where the author cheats. There are always flashes of good writing in Disch\u2019s work, but the point is, SO WHAT? There are probably a thousand people on goodreads, and tens of thousands of bloggers out there who produce such flashes, or, amazingly, keep it up. I think Disch is lazy, but because he has such tickets on his cleverness, he doesn\u2019t think that matters. I beg to differ. But then, to be fair, I don\u2019t think cleverness is nearly sufficient to produce a good piece of writing. Not nearly. It is interesting to consider that we have here two examples of genre writing, both of which consistently fall down in the writing department. Picture books need good pictures and good text is only ever \u2018nice if you can get it\u2019. Science fiction is full of examples of authors who have great ideas but who can\u2019t write. Six year olds probably don\u2019t care and nor do science fiction buffs.

This would be a great book to use with kids in a classroom, not so great a book for your four year old to pull off the shelf and demand you read to them. It's the story of a teddy bear as he goes from German toy workshop, through World War II where he watches his (Jewish) family taken away, to surviving bombings (one upsetting illustration shows dead and wounded soldiers and burning buildings) and going home with an American G.I. In the end he is the means by which two childhood friends are re-united.

The story told is one in which we follow the life of Otto, a bear made and loved, originally in Germany by David, a Jewish boy caught in the dangerous tide of the Nazi regime. Through Otto we encounter a range of people affected by war and fighting, all of different ages, beliefs, colour and nationality yet all linked through the loss and fear that war brings. It's quite beautiful. Whilst it does deal with the persecution of the Jews, for me, the originality lay in it showing fear that German children also went through with the bombing of their own cities. Ungerer tells us how many of the events in the book are experiences that he had gone through himself and ends of the pertinent lines: The worse the situation, the more you learn"}, {"userName": "Agata", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15729084-agata", "userReview": "Loved this one!

It's also crowded with discussion points: not only does David go to a camp, but Oskar's father fights with the other Germans, then the American soldier is black and poor, then there are bullies, then a homeless woman, and even in the reunion of David and Oskar we have men who never had families, one of whom is in a wheelchair.

I do not, however, feel it was accomplished in the text.The idea of relating historical events through the eyes of a teddy bear who is first gifted to a young German Jewish boy during the Holocaust, then to his friend when he is taken away by the Nazis, then taken by an American soldier to the United States where he ends up in an antique store is rife with possibilities for teaching compassion and tolerance and the consequences when we turn our backs on that ideal.I do not think it is a bad thing to read a picture book about the Holocaust with a 4-year-old. I think it is important for children to know that the evil from fairy tales and fiction can exist and even MORE important for them to know that the good in those fictional stories ALSO exists. It is the way in which they learn to be compassionate, caring, contributing members of the world and human existence.That said, it needs to be done in an age-appropriate way. My issue with the book is not its content. It is the fact that there is little to no character development in the teddy bear character or any of the others who come in and out of the story. The author has told an important, gripping story in a way that bored me completely.If the book is directed at young children it has missed its mark. They will not sit through a story that has so much bland narration and almost no dialogue to engage the reader.I could see it being used in middle or high school just as different way to introduce the idea of the Holocaust, but I do not believe those students are going to be pulled in by the narrative.

It addresses the horrors of the war without going too in depth (there are NO scenes inside the concentration camps, but in some illustrations there were fallen soldiers with gunshot wounds.) And after it was done, it opened up a good discussion with my son about why someone would be sent to a prison if they hadn't done anything wrong. We talked about hate, prejudice, and why someone would write a story about it, and I said, \"So we learn and don't let anyone make the same mistakes again.\" He was a little sad about it, but I think it gave him some ideas to chew on.

His first memories are of being stitched together and being given to David, a Jewish boy living in Germany before WWII. David and his best-friend Oskar always play with Otto, using him for pranks, games and even teaching him to type on a typewriter. Life is a lot of fun for the Otto. However, one day, David starts to wear a yellow star on his jacket. He and his parents are soon carted away by men in leather coats and uniforms. David decides to give his dear teddy bear to Oskar. Many lonely days pass for Oskar and Otto. But even gloomier days soon arrive when Osakar's father is drafted into the army and the bombings start. One day, a sudden explosion sends Otto flying through the air and into the middle a raging battle-field. The teddy bear is spotted by a soldier, but the moment the soldier picks Otto up, they are both shot through the chest. Otto and the soldier, an American G.I., are taken away to a hospital. In hospital, the soldier keeps Otto by his side. When he recovers, he pins a medal on Otto's chest, saying that Otto saved his life, taking the brunt of the bullet. The story makes papers and Otto becomes a mascot of the soldier's regiment. The teddy bear is then taken to America and is given to a sweet girl called Jasmin, the soldier's daughter. But Otto's new home and happiness is once again brutally ended when he is snatched away by mean and violent street urchins, who hit and trample on him and throw him into a bin. Otto is then picked up by an antiques dealer and taken to his shop. Years and years go by, until one rainy evening, when a bulky man stops and carefully examines the shop window. The man recognizes the bear instantly buys him. It is Oskar, Otto's old friend. The story of Oskar, a German tourist and survivor of the war finding his teddy bear in America soon makes the papers. And the day after Otto's picture appears in the paper, Oskar's telephone rings: it is his old friend David. And so, the three friends finally reunite, sharing the sorrows and pains of war and living a peaceful and happy life together. Otto now keeps himself busy, typing the story of his life on David's typewriter. Children will become attached to this loving, innocent protagonist, and will naturally be interested in his life story. Tomi Ungerer deals with one of the darkest chapters of history and pulls off the challenge admirably. This tale will prompt reflection and important questions without causing undue fear.", "title": "Otto: the Autobiography of a Teddy Bear", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6943747-otto", "average": 4.09, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348720749l/6943747.jpg", "reviews": 73, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/72770.Tomi_Ungerer", "name": "Tomi Ungerer"}], "type": ["Childrens", "Historical", "Childrens", "World War II"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6943747-otto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3184413-otto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6943762-otto-autobiographie-eines-teddyb-ren", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1097582.Crictor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2586990-the-three-robbers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16076063-fog-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209777.Moon_Man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567326.No_Kiss_For_Mother"]}
