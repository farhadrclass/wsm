Not necessarily from outright attacks or vitriol, but from the assumption that anything other than \u201cstraight\u201d is an anomaly. That we are the outliers. That in order to find the most basic human needs of love and acceptance, we must be willing to share what society believes sets us apart. It\u2019s a vulnerability that is often taken for granted.And that\u2019s why I wrote Runebinder.I\u2019m done writing books where it\u2019s assumed the protagonist and supporting cast are straight. I\u2019m done writing about queer sexuality as though it\u2019s something that must be explained or justified. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014\u201cissue\u201d books concerning sexuality and coming out are so, so important and always will be. But I think (I hope) we\u2019re moving past that point as a culture.We\u2019re learning that sexuality is a spectrum. That we define sexuality and gender\u2014they don\u2019t necessarily define us unless we want them to.When I wrote Runebinder, I wanted to code queer\u2014to write a world where the reader is brought to assume everyone is queer unless told differently. The protagonist Tenn never comes out. He never says \u201cI identify as X\u201d in order to make the friends or save the world or get the guy. And yeah, that\u2019s a fantasy world, but he also uses magic to hunt down humanoid monsters, so let\u2019s not get too caught up in what\u2019s realistic. When I wrote the first draft ten years ago, it was unheard of to have a gay protagonist in a fantasy story. It makes me incredibly happy to see that tide turning, especially in YA fiction. More and more fantastic writers are creating worlds where everyone is a little bit queer, where sexuality is a spectrum and the discussion fluid.\nWe don\u2019t need to be justified to exist, to have a story worth sharing, or to be on the page. We can be. We can breathe. We can exist and see ourselves without having to define who we are, on or off the page. And that, I think, is a powerful message to queer and straight readers alike.We\u2019ve been around forever.We aren\u2019t going anywhere.We have always been the heroes of our own stories.And now, we get to share them with the world.\nI just legit teared up reading this last part and y'all can't believe how excited I am to read this book when it comes out \n(hi publisher and author if you're reading this can I get an ARC maybe?)\nAlso you can read an extract of the first chapter and it sounds really promising so I'm even more excited *__*"}, {"userName": "Crazy4Books", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16445884-crazy4books", "userReview": "The magic and all the deadly creatures were super fascinating in this LGBT fantasy. The main character Tenn is a hunter who battles monsters as well as depression.\u00a0I liked the world and the lore about the gods, but some of it was a little confusing.\u00a0The plot was compelling and intense.\u00a0The amount of death and violence was captivating. I also loved the mystery element. A book without a hint of mystery is like a character without personality. It builds suspense and drives the reader forward. In Runebinder, we try to uncover why Tenns coveted by the human prophets as well as the monstrous kin. Theres a lot of inner struggle going on and Tenns self pity was difficult to read at times, but I understand he's dealing with depression. He was relatably humble and flawed, but his choices at the end were kind of frustrating. The romance was heartbreakingly adorable. I also thought the twins were awesome and that the incubus was intriguing, but I was wary of getting attached to anyone with all the killing going on.The way the story is told felt a bit odd at times. Im not exactly sure why. Maybe its the third person perspective while only following one character or the use of past tense in some places. I dont usually notice analogies, but this book has an abundance of them. Not all of them were necessary, but some were pretty clever.\u00a0I also wasnt a big fan of the jock stereotype in the first couple pages, but I thought the LGBT rep was great. The writing style just takes some getting use to, but the engaging story made it easy to keep reading.This story leans heavily on the chosen one trope without any real explanation as to why Tenn was chosen. I\u00a0saw the major twist coming, but the second part was unexpected. The pace was well balanced between backstory and fight scenes. I was never bored which is a major accomplishment. I expect the writing will improve as the author publishes more books. The Goodreads ratings had me a little worried at first, but I ended up really enjoying it and after the way things ended Im looking forward to the sequel.*received in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Amber Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30813900-amber-robertson", "userReview": "Thank you NetGalley for sending me an eARC in exchange for reviewDNF @ 10% It's been a while since I've had a DNF.

I feel as though I may have DNF'ed it a little early but when the word 'lust' is mentioned twice within a page I can't help the gag that leaves my body and forces me to drop my phone. Can't deal. I also was struggling with the writing style. I'm not sure if it was just the eARC version but it was formatted a tad strange that let to me getting lost, quite a bit. I really couldn't deal. Not only that, but I feel like you're just expected to know what's going on in this world. It's an urban fantasy mixed with a dystopian from the seems of it but nothing was explained by 10%, something that frustrates me because it leaves me wondering if I missed something pages back.

In a world destroyed by magic and greed, and monsters stalking alleyways, only Hunters remain with the powers to challenge them. But they\u2019re fighting a losing battle. Can Tenn fulfill his destiny as the chosen one, and save the world? Or is a seductive promise from the evil Kin tempt him to destroy it?On reading this, I was expecting an epic fantasy with some fantastic minority representation but unfortunately I was a little underwhelmed, and ultimately confused. The magic system and world building is woefully underdeveloped, and little is explained fully. We never know where, what or how people acquire power etc. and the wider world is neither explored or explained. I think the author went too \u2018big\u2019, and perhaps over exerted their ability to recreate such complex new world system. I think this would have worked better if it had more of an \u2018urban fantasy\u2019 or modern setting, or a smaller world that wasn\u2019t so complicated. In addition to this, we also never really see why Tenn is chosen for his task. It\u2019s as though as the reader we just have to accept things for what they are, without delving any deeper into the \u2018why\u2019 of things - which I found frustrating. It was very one dimensional and vague. Tenn I also found a little underwhelming. He\u2019s intense, and not in a good way, and a victim of the all consuming \u2018instalove\u2019 I hate in novels. I want characters that develop a connection over time, with a shared experience. What I don\u2019t want is instant lusting and swooning after spending less than a day with the subject of your affection. Unfortunately that was the case here, and I admit I sighed heavily. I want more creativity in my characters relationships and more complexities. That said, I loved the LGBT aspect. The writing style I also found a little off putting, with an overuse of analogies that grated with me and left the flow of the story a little stilted. I struggled, even though I found the overall plot interesting enough. It\u2019s a very \u2018typical\u2019 quest type fantasy, that normally wouldn\u2019t bother me, but I just found these characters couldn\u2019t really hold their own on an adventure.

I\u2019m surprised I managed to finish it, thank god for my work bestie for not being here and I\u2019m having dinners on my own, a half hour of reading this crappy book a day, woo.This book just felt a bit underdeveloped for me, there was protentional for it to be full of amazing magic, characters, just an overall great fantasy story but it just fell short. The magic system was just a mess, I still after reading the whole book don\u2019t really know how they got the powers, who decided they were special enough to get powers, how the powers work. I WAS JUST SO CONFUSED. Also, the characters? Weeellllll I didn\u2019t really like them, any of them, especially the main character, I just found him a bit annoying and blah.Another big thing that got on my nerves was the fact there was a lot of insta-love, like a lot of eye rolling, he is amazing, blah, blah unrealistic stuff. I just yeah, I didn\u2019t enjoy this very much.The only two things that are some sort of redeemable qualities to this book is the gay rep, woo \u2013 that and the writing which was okay?

Magic comes back to Earth, and everything goes to hell after the corruptibility of humans is capitalized on by vengeful gods. I loved the elemental control and the concept that people could elect to attune to the different spheres and control water, earth, air, and fire. People having grouped up for survival fighting off hordes of deranged former-humans was so awesome. So basically, the world was really cool, and it has a lot of promise. BUT I could not handle the main character and the intensity of his instalove! Holy moly. He enters into a crazy obsession with a fellow magic-using boy after being with him for less than a day. I immediately began hoping they would not be together to hopefully end the never-ending obsessive thoughts about their future dream house complete with pets. It was too much, and I would roll my eyes every single time it came up (frequently). I eventually started rooting for the evil characters hoping they would kill the main character off so that we could get a new main character. It slowed down the plot frequently and distracted from what should have been a fight for the survival of the human race.

His words will shape the world.\"\nRunebinder\u00a0written by Alex R. Kahler is book one in \"The Runebinder Chronicles\".Although November's theme is Blast from the Past, I promised to review some new releases. Today I am fulfilling that promise.\u00a0Runebinder was published this month on the 14th.Story in a Sentence: In a world destroyed by the misuse of magic and greed for power, Tenn has been singled out by a dangerous Kin named Tom\u00e1s but when another hunter named Jarrett comes bearing the news that he is a prophesized one, Tenn needs to decide which side he is on.Before I preordered this book, I scrolled through Goodreads and found this comment with a quote from the author. It struck me straight in the heart and I knew immediately\u00a0that this is the kind of author I want to support.\"We don\u2019t need to be justified to exist, to have a story worth sharing, or to be on the page. We can be. We can breathe.\u00a0We can exist and see ourselves without having to define who we are, on or off the page.\u00a0And that, I think, is a powerful message to queer and straight readers alike.We\u2019ve been around forever.We aren\u2019t going anywhere.We have always been the heroes of our own stories.And now, we get to share them with the world.\"I wanted to love it. I honestly wanted to. I would love to write an amazing review and tell everyone to read it, but I can't. I pride myself on writing honest reviews and I\u00a0cannot give this book a good one.The main problem with this book is lack of explanation. Why is Tenn the chosen one? What does that mean? How will that impact the fate of the world? Why does Tom\u00e1s want Tenn? (This was kind of answered.) Why does Tom\u00e1s hate being called an incubus? What does Tom\u00e1s mean when he says that Jarett has an alternative motive? The questions were endless and barely answered. I understand that this is a series and we will learn more as the story progresses but I would have appreciated a basic platform to then build upon.The confusion was only made worse by the introduction of new characters. I couldn't comprehend why the mattered, what was their role, and how they came to know the other characters. To be fair, it was answered with most of the characters but in a vague way that still left me confused. A perfect example of\u00a0this is Tori. She goes from\u00a0being barely introduced to becoming a\u00a0character that Tenn nearly kills himself\u00a0for. Now I understand he has a deeply emotional character, but even\u00a0Devon and Dreya were all about saving her too. In summary, the introductions of characters and their dynamics did not flow.Now I loved how the author did the LGBTQ element. It is so original and refreshing. Here is another quote from the author: \"When I wrote Runebinder, I wanted to code queer\u2014to write a world where the reader is brought to assume everyone is queer unless told differently. The protagonist Tenn never comes out. He never says \u201cI identify as X\u201d in order to make the friends or save the world or get the guy.\" The amazing thing is he actually accomplished this. I am ridiculously impressed. It didn't feel forced or overpowering. I genuinely enjoyed his \"code queer\" approach. Incredible. I loved it.Ironically, I do have a problem with the relationships. Tom\u00e1s' relationship with Tenn made complete sense. I mean he is incubus? It is a pretty safe bet that Tenn is going to be immediately attracted to him. I also really enjoyed Tom\u00e1s because I have this thing for\u00a0psychotic bad boys. I always ship in favor of the bad boy no matter the consequences. Anyways... Tenn's relationship with Jarrett's bothered me.\u00a0I understand that he knew Tenn from one of the magic schools before the monsters unleashed hell. He was a year ahead of Tenn and they\u00a0had a flirty relationship involving studying in a library. Despite this adorable backstory, how did Tenn and Jarrett go from a bud of a relationship to being full out lovers? Also are they lovers? They kissed a couple of times and slept in the same bed, but I never got the impression that they went to fourth base. I guess it could have meant the less \"saucy\" version, but I didn't get that impression from Tom\u00e1s. Regardless, their dynamic was just way too instantaneous for me. It didn't feel natural, which was really disappointing because they were so cute together.I am obsessed with monsters. If you read my blog, you know this. I was so excited when I discovered that monsters played a huge role in this book. Now I don't know if I am being picky, but I didn't like them, especially the Howls. When reading about monsters, I want detail. I want to be able to clearly picture them because without that I can't be scared. I heard a lot about them but didn't see a lot of action. Despite this, I LOVED Matthias and Tenn's relationship. The clues gave me shivers. The whole game idea was excellently executed. It was very exciting to read about.Overall, this was disappointing. The premise was cool but done in a way that left me with too many questions. The main character was adorable, but not what I want to see in a \"chosen one\" trope. The ending was confusing yet very intriguing. I am giving it a rating of 2.5 stars rounded up to 3. I am rounding up due to the impressive execution of what the author calls a \"queer code\". I have never seen it work before so I feel that Kahler should get some extra credit. At this point, I am debating whether or not to continue the series, but I am definitely considering it.

It\u2019s still such an exciting thing to discover that a queer YA fantasy is heading to shelves, and when I heard about Runebinder it was no different. I was super keen for this story, and the added bonus that it\u2019s #ownvoices.There were no labels used in Runebinder, but I believe if there were Tenn would ID as gay. He only ever thought about a future with husbands in it so I\u2019m going to go ahead and say that this boy likes boys and probably only boys. Which was AMAZING. Having a gay teen boy at the helm of the start of what I can tell is going to be an intense fantasy series is just exciting as hell. To see a love triangle between three guys, to see Tenn struggle between the good boy and the bad boy, to read about his first crush, and his longing for a normal future with a husband and kids and a cute house. It was just EVERYTHING. Every. Thing.2) It\u2019s set in the real worldRunebinder is set in a future where magic came into the world and everything pretty much went to shit. I thought the world building was on point. I loved the way Kahler weaved the information into the story so naturally instead of just info-dumping and being \u2018done\u2019 with it. Another great thing is that I learned more about the world as Tenn learned more about it, which felt like I was really going on the journey with him.The only thing I was a little confused over were the terms used for the evil magic people. I understood what most of them were, but couldn\u2019t quite grasp the difference between two of them. Keep in mind that I read an ARC of this, though, so that could have been cleared up in the final book. And besides, it didn\u2019t have any real impact on my enjoyment of the book, it was just more of a narrowed-eye moment when I couldn\u2019t figure out which was which.3) The first few chapters were a little hard to get intoI\u2019d say about the first three chapters weren\u2019t as gripping as they could have been. As a reader, you\u2019re thrown straight into Tenn\u2019s world without any kind of preamble. Also, a lot happens in those chapters. I was worried that the rest of the book would have that same feeling of not being able to connect to the story but it certainly disappeared for me. By about the fifth chapter or so I was used to the world and the writing, and by the second half of the book it was in my precious kind of territory so it was definitely worth it to push through.4) It kind of felt like a trilogy in one bookWhich I don\u2019t think was a bad thing at all. The book is divided into three parts, so maybe that\u2019s why? I often feel like books that are broken up into parts are only done so for dramatic effect and I can never really tell why there are parts. But the parts in Runebinder are really distinct in terms of story, setting, and character development.-Overall, I really enjoyed Runebinder! It certainly lived up to my excitement for it as a queer YA fantasy. I really hope that it does well because I would absolutely love to see where Tenn\u2019s story takes him, and who he becomes. If you\u2019re looking for a fresh new fantasy with a queer main character then I point you in the direction of Runebinder.\u00a9 2017, Chiara @ Books for a Delicate Eternity.

All thoughts are my own.I really wanted to love this book, it had been hyped up to be the next big fantasy series, with a LGQBTI+ rep as well - I was completely sold. I didn\u2019t dislike it, I didn\u2019t love it \u2013 I just liked it.The unique world Kahler has created is fascinating, however it is delivered in my opinion quite messily \u2013 which leaves the reader frustrated with the book. There is a lot to this world that Kehler has created, from the world itself (it's kind of post-apocalyptic like Earth but post-apocalyptic because of Magic and Necromancers) to the magic, the rules of the magic, gods and the creatures/beings that roam in it.There was a lot of information that just wasn\u2019t put across in the right way because there is literally so much to learn of this world.I found a few things were briefly brushed upon, but given that this is a series, I am sure that we will learn more about those things in the coming books.I honestly didn\u2019t really enjoy the main character Tenn, he was increasingly frustrating, immature and ill tempered. You know why he is like this as you read the novel but it didn\u2019t stop me from rolling my eyes and wishing he would just stop and use his brain for a moment.I really enjoyed the side characters quite a bit, especially the twins. I find them quite fascinating and I look forward to learning more about them in the coming novels.I am completely living for the LGQBTI+ rep in this novel though. It\u2019s so blood good to read a YA Fantasy Novel with LGQBTI+ rep.Plot wise, the book did have a relatively good plot \u2013 but I found it was quite dragging.

It was good to see another queer protagonist and still have them be a fully rounded character. (Of late too many YA SFF books have had diversity as a unique selling point, without doing the work to make it an aspect of the character rather than tokenism.) The story was quite a typical 'chosen one' scenario with enough twists to make it fresh. The overall feel was quite gothic (or dare I say emo?). Personally I wanted there to be more world building. I also felt I spent the whole book looking for a deeper message under the main theme, only to realise that was the message. It was a bit simplistic for me but that's very much personal preference.

I really really tried to get through it but I just couldn't. First off let me start by saying that the premise of the book sounds great and it was immediately something I wanted to read. I started reading this book with high expectations but with each page that I got through it didn't get better. This review will contain a few spoilers for some of the characters and plot, so don't read past this point if you don't want to be spoiled. One thing that I did really like about the part of the book I was able to read through, was that the main character is a gay man. It was refreshing to have a lead character be gay, and to have his love interests reflect that. It's too often that it's just a secondary character that is gay for the sake of diversity, without being provided any love interests. But really that's where the compliments for this book end with me. It could have been a great book with a great gay lead, but instead the main character, Tenn, is whiny, his thoughts and speech were disjointed for me and very rarely does he sound like a well spoken character. His \"love\" interests, if you can call them that, are pathetic and tacky. The \"good guy\" love interest, Jarrett is introduced as this somewhat mysterious figure but just comes across as stale. Also both the main character and him know each other from their shared past. In fact, they even dated at some point. Now the reason they don't immediately recognize each other, even though only a few years have passed since this version of Earth went to hell, is because magic has altered their appearances. But really, I couldn't understand how based on the descriptions provided by the author. A few scars and some muscle mass does not a physical transformation make. The \"bad guy\" love interest, Tomas, is an incubus, although he seems to dislike being called that? Why? Don't know, couldn't bring myself to read till the end of the book to find out. He does however have a weird tendency to say things that make absolutely no sense. His dialogue was atrocious (all of the dialogue is bad). At one point the author described him as wearing skintight black pants, snakeskin cowboy boots, and no shirt. I'm sorry. That description alone should have been enough to make me stop reading there because anyone who puts a character in that kind of outfit and thinks it's attractive has no taste.The character descriptions of everyone honestly is literally just emo kids from high school. No joke, the author himself even uses the word emo to describe a character. Also apparently after the world fell apart, the characters decided to change their original names to the ones they now call themselves. (ie: Jarrett used to be Kevin, and the lead Tenn used to be Jeremy) Why? No idea. Honestly I think Jeremy is a vast improvement over Tenn, but that's me. Overall I couldn't take anymore of the main character's internal, badly written, dialogue. 40% in and I gave up.This book seems to have been written by someone who wanted to create a cool post-apocalyptic magical world and instead created at best some subpar fanfiction for the genre."}, {"userName": "Tabby", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3982894-tabby", "userReview": "First OffSeriously freakin out about the awesomnessAnd the writing so good Oh and for the so called (LOVE TRIANGLE) Shit I shipped bothNow I need to go to read some.....

Um, yes, this is the book for me! As soon as I read the back cover I was sold. 'Magic is risen. As Magic rises, humanity falls.' proclaims the back. Sounds awesome!I will say, I did have some issues. I felt like the beginning was rushed and it didn't calm down for a good 80 or so pages. It was honestly exhausting! Because of the rushed pacing, I never felt fully grounded in the story, and when I was finally getting some much needed explanations about the world and what was happening, it came too late.I also felt like Jarrett and Tenn's relationship was too rushed, and they needed more time together, but what we saw was cute and maybe in time/in the next book their relationship will grow. Then we have Tomas *ahem* and I seriously wonder about him. I mean, he's totally evil right? He goes around killing...but there's something about him too that intrigues me. We'll have to see!I loved the magic, and the twins. I loved all the ideas and the small explanations we were given, but I want to read more and that's no bad thing. Looking forward to book two, a fine beginning.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. The last 75 pages were interesting though.It's weird. The pacing of this book isn't slow. You start off with intense action and delve right into the world. But.... I just didn't feel connected to it.The relationship between Tenn and Jarret is odd. It's cute but odd. The author tries to downplay the insta-love by making them college buddies who had crushes on each other, which would've worked out fine except Tenn didn't even recognize Jarrett when they meet again. I think the author tries to explain this away with trauma of their world falling apart?I'm not sure.There was also A LOT going on. I imagine because this is book 1 and the author is setting the world building up.Typical MC who has low confidence and is even more crippled with being the chosen one.I would read book 2. Would it be high on my TBR? Probably not.It's s decent read but I just didn't have a ton of reactions. Just writing out this review is hard. Nothing much to say about it. A pretty typical dystopian-esque fantasy novel."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3050338-leah", "userReview": "Check out the full review on my blog!"}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45686441-natasha", "userReview": "Review also on my blogTwitterBookstagramI received an arc from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Runebinder can be best described as a regressed future America with elemental magic, featuring a gay main character. The main character Tenn has power over water. There is also a theme of magic being seen as being associated with the devil in this world.\u00a0So for me, this book really fell in the middle. I had trouble completely grasping the magic system and wish it went into more detail, at least for me. I also had trouble following what exactly was happening at time.\u00a0I did really enjoy the main character. He was interesting to read about. He is kind of presented with two love interested, Jarrett and Thom\u00e1s. I would say of the two I prefer Thom\u00e1s. I found Jarrett kind of... boring. Thom\u00e1s was a really interesting character and there's clearly a lot more to him than what's already been presented. Jarrett was a character I didn't really care about.\u00a0I am interested in the rest of the series, I might read the rest of the books when they come out. I do recommend it if you're looking for an own voices gay fantasy, but I found myself bored at times."}, {"userName": "Laura Henry ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41190064-laura-henry", "userReview": "I was immediately delighted by this book because it is a YA fantasy/apocalypse story featuring a gay main character! A log of people have asked me if i like it just because of the LGBTQ inclusion and the answer is no. This book is an incredible fantasy story as well as being a heartfelt gay story. This book has one of the most dynamic casts of characters and the magic Kahler constructed in this world is super interesting.
