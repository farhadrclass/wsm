You might remember Jane from her series, which was hilarious. She died by being shot by a drunk hunter who thought she was a deer. So, yeah, another decent death. I have death-envy of these people.I like this one too. So many options. I feel like a kid in a candy store!This book was hilarious, especially if you have read the previous series and books in this one. Molly Harper writes the funniest crazy antics and snarky lines ever. I highlighted so many funny quips that my ebook is basically yellow now. So, instead of typing them all out for you, I have decided to type out none of them for you.

This series is definitely one where you need to read one or two earlier books before diving onto this ebook. Many of the cast and crew do cross over and you can get very lost and not enjoy the book as much should you read this as a stand-alone. In fact, it took me a chapter or two to fully get back into the neighborhood.What is great about the author\u2019s writing is that she does try to remind and tell you about the relationships within the course of the story. Once I remembered everything, the book really took off.Fun and quirky, with plenty of sarcasm and humor, this book is a delightful read! The plot is a whirlwind but oh so good. I always end with a smile of my face, with great anticipation for the next book!If you enjoy a fun paranormal story about vampires that is like non-other, you have to try the series!

The humor is great and the romance is cute, although it's not the main relationship focus of the book. The main point here is that Meagan is a foster child with some serious abandonment issues and she's being exposed to Jane's enormous extended family and being drawn in, and she's got no idea how to play that role.There's a B-plot to keep things moving around why Meagan is different, but the focus is clearly on the emotional lives of these characters as it has been through the whole series.

Jane is forced to take them under her wing and roof when the events surrounding their turning and abilities come to the attention of the Council and they want answers or else.First off, I\u2019d like to say the blurb for this book is a bit misleading, but that\u2019s okay because what really happens is far more entertaining. While this can be read as a standalone; the arc is new and the conflict resolves internally, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. There is a large character base in this series and they pop in and out of the storyline along with references to previous situations at random.Meagan Keene, a student at the University of KY and friends with Ophelia Lambert, just wanted to get to know the very handsome and sexy Ben Overby better. When they meet up at a party and make plans to see each other again real soon, she didn\u2019t expect it to be 24 hours later, after she is killed in a freak ultimate frisbee accident and turned into a vampire. A very special hybrid vampire who is breaking all the normal vampire rules and freaking everyone out. Then she accidentally turns Ben into a vampire, all hell breaks loose, and she and Ben are swept up and spirited away to Half Moon Hollow, KY so they can be watched over and studied by Jane until she deems them safe for society.\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to take in,\u201d Jane told me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, but you don\u2019t have a lot of time to mull it over. Also not much choice. It\u2019s pretty much a \u2018come quietly or I involve zip ties\u2019 situation.\u201dMolly Harper\u2019s energetic and zany adventures are the perfect escapism for those who enjoy a strong balance of romance and comedy. From her contemporaries to her paranormals, Harper\u2019s rich and engaging imagination lets loose with her eclectic character, comedic plot lines, and whip smart narrative. Accidental Sire introduces a few new characters and plot thread while bringing us up to speed on past situations and couples. The straightforward storyline along with its invigorating dialogue makes for a fast fun read.Meagan is Jane Jamison part deux. Her snarky wit, suspicious nature, and expressive inner monologue makes her officially one of my top favorite heroines in this series. Orphaned at a young age, Meagan was raised in foster care which resulted in her inability to form long lasting attachments. Her parents\u2019 deaths and her frequent moves from home to home taught her that everyone leaves her eventually. Regardless of her tragic childhood, she has a created a pseudo family of sorts at college with her besties and maintains a strong sense of self, confidence, and motivation.Ben Overby is a sweetie. Smart, attractive, and good natured, he is every mama\u2019s dream for their daughter. Dumped by his childhood girlfriend, Gigi from The Dangers of Dating A Rebound Vampire, #3, when he asked her to marry him, Ben escaped the humiliation by going to U of KY and meets Meagan. He never had a desire to be a vampire so his turning is a shock and he doesn\u2019t take it well.\u201cI had a life before you bit me. I had plans. And they didn\u2019t involve being turned into a vampire. This is not supposed to me be me, OK? I\u2019m the Stiles. I\u2019m the powerless, normal human who sits on the sidelines and watches the people with the superpowers do their thing, and then I help clean up the mess.\u201dThe slow evolution of Meagan and Ben\u2019s relationship is a delightful journey filled with antagonism, humor, sarcasm, and some internal sexual longing. Ben is angry with Meagan for turning him against his will though it was through no fault of her own. He spends a majority of the story alternating between his anger and his attraction to her. Their romance burns very slow but gains ground as they begin to accept their new life.\u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m crazy in love with you or making a doll out of the hair you leave in the drain or anything. But strong \u2018liking you\u2019 feelings, like thinking about you all the time.\u201dHarper does a fabulous job of balancing the internal conflicts Meagan is dealing with being a vampire, her potential boyfriend/childe hating her, being locked out of social media- with the external conflict of a crazy Council scientist who\u2019s determined to crack her\u2019s and Ben\u2019s genetic code. Through any means necessary. Harper uses the time spent at Jane\u2019s to help crack Meagan\u2019s shell and allow her to bond and accept her new vampire family though the ride is a little bumpy.She put her hand on my shoulder, gave it a squeeze. \u201cI know you think I\u2019ve been a bit of a bitch through this whole process.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve actually thought, \u2018Wow, Jane\u2019s being a little bit of a bitch right now,\u2019 and you read my mind?\u201d\u201cYes, and in some ways, you\u2019ve been right. I\u2019ve had to be a bitch. I don\u2019t like it. But that\u2019s my job with the Council. I\u2019m doing what I can to make like easier for vampires without committing overt acts of evil as was the Council\u2019s usual way. And if I have to be kind of mean to keep you safe, so be it. But I do understand what it\u2019s like to have friends who mean more than family could. And I hope someday you start to include some of us in that little circle.\u201dOf course, no Half Moon Hollow story would be complete without getting up close and personal with some of its residents. This rambunctious and quirky cast-from Ophelia\u2019s little sister Georgie whose creepiness is at a level all its own to Jeb the shape-shifting shark to Jane\u2019s bestie and his redneck werewolf wife-will leave you howling as Meagan absorbs her first real experience with a full supernatural community. Jane\u2019s strong presence in here reminded me of all the fun and laughter I had reading the original Jane Jamison series. I loved seeing Jane and her ever irritating sidekick Dick working together again as Jane rushes in to save her \u2018kids\u2019 from the evil scientist and show Meagan that she does indeed matter.Jane threw her arms around me in a bear hug. \u201cI know this is not your fault but please don\u2019t do that to me again,\u201d she whispered into my hair.\u201cI will do my best not to get abducted by a mad scientist a third time.\u201d\u201cSee that you don\u2019t.\u201dI highly recommend picking up Molly Harper\u2019s newest Half Moon Hollow adventure-Accidental sire- if you like your PNRs witty, energetic, and heartfelt."}, {"userName": "Carmel (Rabid Reads)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4561998-carmel-rabid-reads", "userReview": "Full review to follow."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2806016-melanie", "userReview": "My review and an extended sample of the audiobook are posted at Hotlistens.com.I\u2019m a huge fan of of the Half-Moon Hollows series. This series is always able to make me laugh. They are fun and quick reads that I know will put me in my happy place. This one is exactly what I expected from this series. It was exactly what I needed when I started this story (which I listened to in a single day).So this story starts off at University of Kentucky with Meagan Keene (who we met in Big Vamp on Campus). She is friends with Ophelia (can you believe she has friends??). She was talking with Ben Overby at a party. Just moments later, she is hit with a 45 pound barbell that was being used for Ultimate Frisbee by some vamps. She accepts being turned into vamp instead of dying, which is what would\u2019ve happened. A guy named James Marsters (love the Buffy reference here, though I\u2019ll admit that the name makes me think more of Harry Dresden than Spike) offers to turn her and then disappears. Problem is that this isn\u2019t normal. Meagan wakes up way too soon. She also bites Ben when he was visiting her (while she should be dead to the world). He is turned too, which shouldn\u2019t happen.So in this story, Jane has to figure out what is going on. She takes Meagan and Ben back to her place to keep an eye on them until everyone figures out what is going on and they are able to control themselves around humans. They are both working for Jane at the council. The scientist doctor there has an unhealthy obsession with figuring them.This was another fun addition to the series. I loved seeing Jane and the gang again. Georgie has a larger presence in this story, which I really enjoyed. I liked Meagan and Ben\u2019s story. I liked the mystery as they searched for why Meagan and Ben are different from all vampires before them. There are a ton of fun one-liners that made laugh out loud several times (as in all Molly Harper books).NarrationI love Amanda Ronconi\u2019s narration of this series. She is perfect for this series. She really brings out the humor between the characters. I can\u2019t even imagine reading this series. I started off with audiobooks and I don\u2019t see that ever changing.

While the main characters in this one ( Ben and Megan) were a little on the New Adult side for me (sorry college romance just isn't my thing) they were still really fun. Plus all my old favorites were back and up to general hijinks that made me giggle. Seriously though, even for a young couple they weren't too angsty so they earned major points for that plus they were both geeks so I totally rooted for them :) :)This was a total blast to listen too! Amanda Ronconi really brings Molly's writing alive. I do admit that this outing with a huge cast of the main characters, I thought Jane's voice sounded different and Megan sounded more like I was used to hearing Jane so there was a bit of an adjustment for me at the beginning.

Especially in audio! Molly Harper's characters are so much fun. They are in serious situations, but they still manage to spit out a wisecrack here and there. I like how each book brings in new characters, not so much from the main group of Half Moon Hollow characters, but from characters who we only saw as side characters with small parts. For instance, Meagan as one of Ophelia's friends from school and now she's a main character. The connections all build together and you never know who you are going to see in the next book.With Accidental Sire, we are going to get some new vampire skills. Meagan and Ben are not going to be your run of the mill vampires. There are new, off the wall bad guys. But of course, there will be some small link between them and our main characters. I had so much fun watching our main characters not only get used to being vampires, with training from Jane, but also go through testing to see just what new powers they have. They go through a lot of close calls and they work to bring Ben and Meagan closer together. Ben has a hard time at first, but he eventually puts a great spin on his new life. That helps Meagan who feels so guilty for her part in Ben's transformation.As always, I love our main Half Moon Hollow characters and how they all come together for things. They all stick together. The characters have all been created with such fun and crazy characteristics, you can't help but love them. Ben and Meagan are the same way. Ophelia's sister, who now lives with Jane and Gabriel, has some great scenes. I really love Georgie and how she alternates between how an adult would act, and how a child her age would be.If I need a good escape book, I think this is the series I'd pick up. I was fascinated by the difference in Ben and Meagan, but also all the side characters. They all work together to make the book a great adventure, but one with many laughs for me. Increasing the fun is listening to Accidental Sire as an audiobook. Amanda Ronconi totally rocks this series and I can't imagine a Molly Harper book without her.

The concept of being turned into a vampire because of an accident involving extreme Frisbee and a 45 pound weight amused me, but after that it just didn\u2019t capture my attention. I feel like Harper is really stretching this series thin, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much material left for her to play with and every time I read a new book it\u2019s slightly more mundane and I lose more interest.Summing up, this book was kind of okay, but also kind of not.

This is Ben Overby, and Meagan Keene\u2019s story line. ACCIDENTAL SIRE can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty although I recommend reading the series in order for cohesion, backstory and the characters\u2019 histories.Told from first person point of view (Meagan Keene) ACCIDENTAL SIRE follows the unconventional human death and vampire re-birth of University of Kentucky co-eds Meagan Keene and Ben Overby. Following a freak Ultimate Frisbee accident Meagan lay on the verge of death and the only possibility of survival was through a vampire turning. But only twenty-four hours would pass, unlike the usual seventy-two, wherein our story line heroine would wake up a more powerful and hybrid version of the \u2018normal\u2019 vampire. What ensues is the accidental turning of Ben Overby, and the search for the person responsible for the new breed of vampire with above average abilities.As new vampires, Ben and Meagan will fall under the guidance of Jane Jameson-Nightingale, leader of the local chapter of the World Council for the Equal Treatment of the Undead, and a powerful vampire in her own right. Locked down and treated like fledglings just out of the nest, Ben and Meaghan struggle within the confines of the vampire rules and newbie regulations. But someone wants Meaghan and Ben for nefarious purposes, and on more than one occasion our leading couple find themselves caught up in someone else\u2019s plans.There is a large ensemble cast of secondary and supporting characters including many of the previous story line couples, as well as a number of couples from the author\u2019s Jane Jameson series. Meagan is introduced to a world of vampires, shifters and werewolves, as well as a plethora of information about her new life as a supernatural creature of the night.ACCIDENTAL SIRE is a story of family and friendship, and the struggle for two young people to acclimate into the world of the supernatural. Molly Harper weaves humor, fun, romance and conflict into a paranormal story line where creating the ultimate vampire is akin to creating a more perfect human being. The premise is entertaining and enjoyable; the characters are colorful, energetic and sassy; the romance is sweet, sexy but mostly implied. Molly Harper\u2019s ACCIDENTAL SIRE is a heartwarming story that will captivate your attention with its\u2019 lighthearted look at the supernatural.Copy supplied by Netgalleywww.thereadingcafe.com"}, {"userName": "Jen (That's What I'm Talking About)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4017411-jen-that-s-what-i-m-talking-about", "userReview": "Accidental Sire opens at the conclusion of Big Vamp on Campus novella. Series part-timer Ben is smitten with Ophelia\u2019s human friend Megan. But just as they say goodnight, Megan is accidentally struck by a heavy weight and killed. A volunteer vampire agrees to sire her and then vanishes. When Megan wakes after only 24 hours and has two sets of fangs, Jane Jameson and the Vampire Counsel swoop in to discover what is going on and mentor the newly made vampire. It\u2019s been a few books since the story has focused on the original Jane Jameson group and Half-Moon Hollow, but Accidental Sire brings back all the favorites of Half-Moon Hollow and the Council offices. Whether or not it is the return to the familiar setting and characters, Accidental Sire just feels good. Little issues I\u2019ve had with the previous books were nonexistent. The story is tight and the characters likable, without annoying habits or too-stupid-to-live flaws.While Ben and Megan\u2019s story is on the light side, it\u2019s very much appropriate for the college-aged couple. They have an adorable meet-cute, but the whole being turned into a vampire thing puts a damper on their budding romance. I enjoyed the slower pace, which was filled with laugh-out-loud moments. A Molly Harper audiobook wouldn\u2019t be the same without the terrific work of Amanda Ronconi. She has the perfect amount of southern charm, bundled with sharp wit and droll sarcasm to fit Ms. Harper\u2019s characters. I swear I can see Ms. Ronconi roll her eyes when portraying Jane. However, while I love Amanda\u2019s narration, it is very difficult to hear differences between her characters at times. This is compounded by the fact that each Half-Moon Hollow book is written in first person narrative, with each book featuring a different female lead. So it makes for some difficulty following who is speaking at times, most noticeably between the female characters.Accidental Sire is a wonderful mix of Molly Harper\u2019s trademark humor, a sweet romance, and an intriguing mystery. I laughed out loud more than once at silly jokes referencing pop culture and people just being silly. Every character has a bit of snark, and Amanda Ronconi gives the dialogue just the right emphasis, pulling off the sarcasm seamlessly.My Rating: A-Narration: A-"}, {"userName": "Santhiya", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46210916-santhiya", "userReview": "I used to laugh a lot while reading molly harper's books.

The main characters weren't all that interesting. The story didn't have any peaks, or curves (or at least enough drama) to keep me entertained. This is a nice enough story. Personally, I was hoping for more fun."}, {"userName": "\u270eStacey \"The One Night Biter\"", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11431444-stacey-the-one-night-biter", "userReview": "This was truly absolutely the funniest book yet.

Accidental Sire is a joy and pleasure to read. Seeing the characters I have come to love show up was the best part of Accidental Sire for me.The romance in this new Half-Moon Hollow installment was just ok. I have always liked Ben whe I saw him in previous books and I absolutely loved Megan, I thought she is an awesome addition to the series. Megan and Jane's relationship was another highlight for me and I would have been totally ok if that was all this story was. A story of this young girl finding herself in this paranormal world by accident and totally crushing it.However, this is a paranormal romance and its weakest link is Ben. Ben was an absolute jerk for most of Accidental Sire and by the time he and Megan were ready to be together I couldn't help but wish she would find someone else, because I totally think she deserved better.Yes, I admit, Ben did get better in the end. I just think it was too close of not being too little to late. I am happy that they are happy, though LOL.All in all Accidental Sire is as awesome paranormal adventure with an ok romance, but that is enough to make for a great addition to the Half-Moon Hollow series, one of my fave series ever!I want more!"}, {"userName": "decafJess", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12498816-decafjess", "userReview": "Goofy, snarky chick-lit that is the literary equivalent of a marshmallow-covered hot chocolate. Meagan meets Ben at a college party, and what seems at first like a typical meet-cute turns unexpectedly tragic. In the aftermath, Meagan and Ben are vampires, and find themselves cloistered away by a quirky crew of veteran vampires intent on training them to behave in the midst of their new talents and urges. The cast of characters is quirky and heartwarming, including Jane, a children's librarian-turned-vampire boss, the inexplicably-named vampire Dick Cheney, Jed, a man who occasionally turns into a land shark when stressed, and a kind but homicidal immortal child named Georgie, to name a few. Obviously, there's a sinister plot that needs to be solved, family bonding, personal growth, falling in love, etc.I'm generally not a fan of romance, but the romance in this series isn't too overwhelming. It's a quick read, and this author remains one of my favorite guilty pleasures.received via NetgalleydecafJess"}, {"userName": "Jonmontanavega", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42982946-jonmontanavega", "userReview": "I've quoted lines I relish from Sire 3 times just in the past 24 hours. 50% done and I rate Amanda Roconi's narration and Molly Harper's writing, filled with many NON-cliches at 5+ stars.

It was cool to see Ben get his own book but the story does take place from Meagan's PoV.Meagan is an English major at the University of Kentucky that is in her final year. Meagan lost her father at 4 years old and her mother at 15 and then had to live in Foster homes. Meagan worked hard to get scholarships for college and has focused mainly on her grades and her few close friends. She happened to become friends with Ophelia (the heroine from Big Vamp on Campus) and went to a party Ophelia put on, meeting Ben and hitting it off.Ben is in college at the University of Kentucky and is finishing up his degree in programming. He's human but used to go out with Gigi (they broke up in I'm Dreaming of an Undead Christmas), who is connected with the Vampire community in the Half-Moon Hollow area. Ben never intended to become a vampire even if he was more than a little familiar (and friendly) with that community.Ben and Meagan meet at Ophelia's party and find that they have a really strong connection. They talk all night and split apart in the wee hours of the morning, making plans for their first real date. Unfortunately, Meagan is hit by a 45 lb weight that some vampires are using in place of a Frisbee for a more challenging game of \"Ultimate Frisbee\". She's hurt badly and only survives because she's turned into a vampire. Ben goes to visit her and when she wakes up earlier than expected, winds up biting Ben. She doesn't drain him but something about her bite turns him without the blood exchange or her even intending to do so. The counsel is called in and Jane isn't too pleased with Meagan because of the fact that she turned Ben, intentional or not.Jane ends up taking both Meagan and Ben to her place to learn how to be vampires and also try to figure out why Meagan and Ben seem to be somewhat different from normal vampires. Unfortunately, Ben didn't want to be a vampire and he takes his angst over this life change out on Meagan. Meagan had really been starting to like Ben so she was saddened by his change and wished he'd go back to being the Ben she liked before everything happened. Jane's initial issue with Meagan does disappear as she gets to know Meagan better and Ben eventually stops taking his angst out on her. Once Ben starts behaving decently, he and Meagan find their initial attraction wasn't a fluke and gradually become a couple. After everything is settled, like how the new type of vampire was made and by whom, Meagan and Ben are able to start their new vampire lives together and seem to be heading towards an eventual HEA.This was a very enjoyable story. I liked Meagan very much and I can't really think of any complaints about her. I liked the connection between Ben and Meagan in the beginning and I have to admit that his change in attitude towards Meagan did sour me towards him a bit...especially because it took Ben well over half the book for him to get over his angst. Once he got over his attitude, I liked Ben fine. I really liked how Jane and company were able to become a new family for Meagan and make her feel accepted into her new \"community\". Overall, the story was fun and very enjoyable and I'd recommend it. :)* note - I listened to the audio version of this book and the narrator did a great job."}, {"userName": "\u2600Rachael\u2600", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5518849-rachael", "userReview": "More fun and games with the gang."}, {"userName": "Angela Simmons", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2485036-angela-simmons", "userReview": "Sass, snark, and yummy undead goodness, Molly Harper does it again! Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on: Ben Overby\u2019s used to the eclectic residents of Half-Moon Hollow and the shenanigans they get up to. But when Meagan, his girlfriend, is changed into vampire after a freak Ultimate Frisbee accident and rises quicker than normal and changes him into a member of the undead with a single bite, there\u2019s a whole new level of weird he has to figure out. And Meagan, well let\u2019s just say she\u2019s out of her depth. She\u2019s figuring out how to allow herself to be accepted into the strange but loving Half-Moon Hollow family, she\u2019s also dealing with being a new breed of vampire, accidentally siring her first childe (which happens to be her boyfriend) and figuring out how to deal with her feelings towards said boyfriend who is a little cranky at being turned. I always enjoy being back in the weird and wonderful world of Half-Moon Hollow. I\u2019m never really sure what the residents will be up to but I know it\u2019s going to be entertaining and The Accidental Sire did not disappoint.Meagan first made an appearance in Big Vamp on Campus and I was curious to learn more about her. I really liked Meagan. After the death of her mother, she was bounced around from foster home to foster home and she doesn\u2019t really know where she fits in and if she can trust those who claim to care for her so when she becomes a foster-vampire in the Jameson-Nightengale household, she\u2019s not sure if she can really trust Jane and her brood. She\u2019s also trying to work through her feelings towards Ben. I\u2019ve always liked Ben. If you\u2019ve read this series, you\u2019ll know that Ben is Gigi\u2019s ex, so he\u2019s been around for a bit. He\u2019s always been one of the humans in Jane\u2019s crazy paranormal world and now that\u2019s he a vampire, he\u2019s trying to figure out how to navigate this world. The romance was a bit slow and it worked. They had things that had to work out and Meagan had some trust issues she needed to deal with but I was really pleased with how sweet and realistic it was. There\u2019s also a slight suspense element thrown in. What I really enjoyed was seeing the Half-Moon Hollow gang again. It was so nice to see more of Jane and Gabriel now that they are sort of raising Georgie. Although I do have to say, it\u2019s a little weird seeing Ophelia acting all nice and normal. On a sidenote, I would really like to see a short story about Jane and Gabriel raising Georgie. So, while this is part of an on-going series, you don\u2019t have to read the entire series. I would, however, recommend reading Big Vamp on Campus, the prequel to this book to get a better understanding of the characters. Overall, this was another great installment in the series and I devoured this book in one sitting."}], "description": "In Molly Harper's newest paranormal romantic comedy, Ben, Gigi's old boyfriend, must find a way to save his new love after a freak Ultimate Frisbee accident.
