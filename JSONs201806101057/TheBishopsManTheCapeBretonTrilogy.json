It took me at least half-way through to figure out what he was doing, and to shed the preconceptions of what I thought this book was going to be. The last 10050 pages are masterful. _______________________[later]This turned out to be a different novel, a better novel, than the one I was expecting. I know Linden MacIntyre as a journalist, and knew this was about the sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church. So I expected a journalistic exploration of that topic in novel form. Sorry, Mr. MacIntyre; I misunderestimated you.This is a novel about damaged people, damaged communication, and the personally destructive power of secrets. It's about loneliness and isolation, and what that does to people. (And strangely enough, it's the third novel I've read, three of three in 2011, that touches directly or indirectly on orphan-dom. I don't really know what that means, but I am the granddaughter of an orphan, and my father was powerfully affected by that, so there's definitely something going on here). This novel is also about coming from a place \u2013 metaphorical, physical \u2013 that is defined by poverty, trauma and addiction. A place where everyone is related to everyone (who\u2019s yer fadder? or in this case, who's yer mudder?), but there is little intimacy and little meaningful communication or connection between people. There can't be, because there are such huge gaps in self-knowledge and so many secrets.The poverty is not just because of a changing way of life that leads people \"away\" (and priests astray) and leaves those left behind with little to hope for. It is a poverty of spirit built from layers of emptiness that have been laid down over generations as each deals with its own secrets, and most die with them unexorcised. And it's about all kinds of trauma, all kinds of addiction \u2013 personal bedevilment that extends far beyond the priesthood. And yes, it's about the sex scandals in the priesthood too. But these are put into a much broader and much more personal context.It's also about what the priesthood is \u2013 why people enter it and how they struggle to define it for themselves. Beyond that, it's about how the scandals personally affect(ed) those of faith: the wrenching conflict between one's faith, one's trust in one man who represents that faith, and the truth.What it's not is particularly atmospheric of Cape Breton; i.e., the external landscape of the place, although there are lots of descriptions of wind and rain/snow and cold and general bleakness, but these I feel are secondary and irrelevant. There\u2019s a nod to the loss of Gaelic (and it\u2019s important which character retains it, but I won\u2019t spoil that here). I believe the loss of Gaelic is a metaphor for the loss of faith among these Cape Bretoners, whose island became a dumping ground for \"bad\" priests. The internal landscape of Cape Breton is well-told, although it's not a particularly flattering portrait. Here's what I liked, loved even: this book didn't rest on pat explanations. It's too simple merely to say that the forced celibacy of the priesthood leads to aberrant sexual behaviour. Or, that damaged people are attracted to the priesthood, at which point they are damaged further. There is nothing particularly anti-Catholic here (at least, as a non-Catholic, I didn't think so; Catholics might disagree). On the contrary, it's a sensitive and searching portrayal of an issue, and the people involved in it, which respects not just the complexity of their faith but also their humanity.MacIntyre does a great job of what is essentially a character portrait (more than one, in fact) of a flawed and complex human being who happens to be a priest. Father MacAskill starts as a brittle, weak, ineffective priest who knows little of himself or of dealing with the faithful, beyond performing a duty to the Mother Church that implicates him in the scandals. He degenerates from there. As he bottoms out and confronts his own demons, lo and behold \u2013 he becomes not only more human, but also a better priest. (And MacIntyre does a 1000 percent better job of that character arc than I just did, which is why he won the Giller, I'd say). :-pWell. Anyway. MacIntyre\u2019s thesis \u2013 if he can be said to have one \u2013 is that nothing is as simple as it seems, and that priests go awry, as all humans do, when they deny or repress \u2013 or never know \u2013 the truth about themselves. This is also a portrayal of a crisis of faith not in terms of one man's attempt to understand his relationship to God, but to understand his relationship to himself, to his past and to his calling. One other thing: most of the reviews I've read comment on the disjointed nature of the narrative structure, with its flashbacks and flash-forwards. You need to be patient with this, because while it's disorienting at first, it gets more cohesive as the plot unfolds (and in fact, I believe this is intentional. As Fr. MacAskill becomes whole, the threads of time are tied together, and the links between past, present and future start to make sense. It\u2019s quite clever.)Concurrent with that, the dialogue is also disorienting at first. Conversation seems to go nowhere, or seems to rely on some kind of implicit but unspoken understanding between characters to which the reader is not privy. People talk, but there are gaps in dialogue (lots unsaid, lots under the surface), and weird stops, starts and jumps to conclusions as jarring as the jumps back and forth in time. As Fr. MacAskill\u2019s and others\u2019 pasts are revealed, true understanding \u2013 connection, even intimacy \u2013 starts to emerge. And then, sensible dialogue begins. By the last 50 pages, as the timing and the dialogue become whole and rich, this novel starts to feel entirely worthy of the accolades and awards it won (which is to say that I think criticisms of inconsistency, a lack of sure-handedness or trickery with respect to managing the novel's narrative flow or dialogue miss the point). In the last third of the book, one of its most interesting (at least to me) themes coalesces, as the dialogue \u2013 i.e., not what is said but what is not said \u2013 changes: secrets prevent communication which prevents intimacy. And that fundamental, very existential aloneness \u2013 beyond sexual to an all-encompassing kind of connection to oneself, one's past, one's roots and family, and one's vocation, not to mention to others \u2013 is at the root of dysfunction, dread and despair. (There are several interesting references to existentialism, and Fr. MacAskill himself reads Heidegger). A powerful novel. Maybe not a complete 5, but let it stand for now."}, {"userName": "Shane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1798222-shane", "userReview": "A topical story for our times told by an insider, Fr. Duncan MacAskill, who is a \"hit man\" for his church, responsible for removing sexual predators from among his colleagues to safer grounds, (so that they are free to commit more crimes, it seems from the news reports these days).The story focuses on Duncan's unravelling and descent into alcoholism from combinations of the guilt piled on during his childhood, his suppressed feelings towards the women in his life, the isolation of his office, and the \"sins of the fathers\" that he has to clean up.Three stories intersect: Duncan's father and his buddies' wartime \"collateral damage\" which result in later abuse and suicide, Duncan's sojourn in the Honduras during the \"70's which also ends in tragedy, and his present story when he is sent as custodian of an isolated parish in Cape Breton (really intended to get him out of the way of a nosey press), not far from where he grew up and where his closet's skeletons are eagerly awaiting him. Bringing the three story lines into sharper focus and towards a painful resolution is the suicide of a young man in the parish community - by now, a recognized outcome of unresolved sexual abuse. Fr. Duncan is impelled to hunt down the perpetrator, despite having walked away from his previous job. The author draws a sympathetic and haunting portrait of Duncan MacAskill, who seems to bear everyone's guilt, of victims and perpetrators alike. The sense of community in the parish is also evoked very well by people frequently bumping into each other or visiting the priest for a drink, and by illicit sexual couplings between parishioners from among the rather slim pickings available. Viciously guarded family secrets prove to be the only impediments to Duncan finding out \"whodunit.\"The author uses an economy of words, both in narrative and in dialogue to convey a lot. I particularly liked his short treatise on the Burdens of Priesthood (a.k.a. \"what they don't teach you in seminary\"): the struggle against idle speculation, the sterility of moral power in the age of secular celebrity, living alone without privacy, the burden of trust without intimacy, and struggling with fantasies about the ordinary - enough to make one take the cloth and shove it!Despite this being a Giller winner, I couldn't help feel a bit lost in the rapid, and sometimes unwarranted, time shifts - some contrived for effect and pacing. I also felt that the tenses could have been better written and that it would have been okay once in a while to be a bit more direct about what was happening. There were words like \"bum\" \"penis\" and \"anus\" tossed out but the acts behind them were discussed in a roundabout fashion, as if there was fear of a lawsuit in an age when this subject is front and centre of the news."}, {"userName": "Peachy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095554-peachy", "userReview": "With Linden MacIntyre being one of my favourite journalists, I was thrilled to hear of his novel being honoured as the winner of the Scotiabank Giller prize for 2009. After reading the synopsis of the story, I knew it would be an uncomfortable read, but trusted in MacIntyre\u2019s reverence and honesty to make it through. I was not disappointed.The Bishop\u2019s man is a story told in spirals, as we twist and turn through past and present fluidly, giving us a clearer picture of the events that can become cloudy through space and time. It is by way of these happenings that we are presented with brutally honest characters living lives of deceit and despair. These tragically flawed people are human in their beastliness, conflicted, damaged, and eternally struggling to break the vicious cycle of pain and suffering.At times my anger was palpable as the Bishop insisted on covering up the harsh realities of the evil-doings administered by the hands of his precious and misunderstood brotherhood, where \u2018victims\u2019 were only the creations of over-active imaginations and troubled youth. On more than one occasion I wrestled with my understanding of good and evil, and what faith means in today\u2019s modern world. I am of the mind that Catholicism and its primitive structures are in need of a revamp in respect to how the world has changed, and what we\u2019ve learned about humanity along the way. For the sake of the Catholics out there, I pray that they will make the changes that are needed to gain back so many members that they have lost due to their closed-mindedness and denial. As na\u00efve as some may consider it, I will always believe that faith is an important and necessary part of a happy, moral and fulfilling life.Amidst the madness and injustice, we pause to take in the haunting and beautiful descriptions of small towns, where you can hear the fiddle and smell the sea salt lifting off the page. Linden MacIntyre has proven to be an adoring poet in his love of the East coast and of the Gaelic and English languages. His words are profound and emotive, and I look forward to picking up his other novels in the hopes of more of the same.Just a couple of his affecting offerings\u2026\u201cThe future has no substance until it turns the corner into history.\u201d \u201cThe bay is flat, endless pewter beneath the rising moon.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5943943-autumn", "userReview": "\"You know the eagles secret? He never lets us see him scavenging. You only see him soaring. Or sitting high up, somewhere out of reach. Kind of superior. He's very discreet about the mundane, the mortal... It's easier to mythologize that way.\" (346)This book moved me in unexpected ways. As a member of a \"helping\" profession, I often find myself extremely isolated. I work with sexual offenders, addicts, victims- much as the central character of this story- and he truly gets the sense of isolation that comes with this type of work. What a person does to stay centred when hearing tales of hell-on-earth, holding the space with guilt, smugness, entitlement, excuses...then being with the families...and being with my own family. I found myself sympathizing at every turn. Sometimes I shed my own tears.\"How much will I disclose about isolation? The pain of personal impotence?...Living alone without privacy. The burden of trust without intimacy.\" (139)I am facing a time in my own career when I struggle with the idea of a change, some of the reasons shared with our protagonist here, and some of my own ideas about a more simple life. This very much jaded my interaction with the story, and it is rare that I do so much self-disclosure in a book review. Suffice to say, MacIntyre has written a beautiful novel, taking a tragic situation and opening up the doors of the complex exploration, acknowledging that every crime has multiple victims, nothing is ever simple and everyone needs a break sometimes.\"A rest? I don't need a rest. I need an exit.\" (308)"}, {"userName": "Mary Lou", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4109842-mary-lou", "userReview": "I avoided this book because of the repulsiveness of the subject matter and, were it not for book club, would probably have kept on avoiding it. That would have been a shame, as it\u2019s turned out to be a good book. The main character struggles with guilt arising from many \u201csins\u201d of omission and commission in his past, one of them being his role as the bishop\u2019s go-to guy whenever it was time to move a troublesome priest to a place where he might not cause quite so much trouble. The book grapples with the results of child abuse and asks why, but doesn\u2019t attempt to provide easy answers - though I was certainly left with the impression that if only people would be open and would not keep \u201csecrets\u201d many problems would be lessened or avoided. I got a bit annoyed with the style in places as Father MacAskill\u2019s past was revealed in brief bits from his Central America journal and short snatches of childhood memory, but eventually all was revealed and all the threads were woven together. I liked the genuine feeling for place that came through loud and clear.

I was expecting a straight narrative about sexual abuse in one church or community. Instead I got this rich, layered narrative about the priest's role, isolation and the challenges of being both a priest and a man. I loved MacIntyre's style of writing, and the weave of the narrative. Nothing in here was black or white, and the story continued to raise questions throughout.

I didn't expect to like this novel, but I did, very much. I became totally engrossed in it. It's a quiet, psychological novel, written in a well-crafted spare style. The subject couldn't be more important or relevant. The main character, a sympathetic priest who only wants to do the right thing, is given the assignment of helping to cover up the sexual abuses that are increasingly coming to light. His suspicions, and discomfort, increases. This novel is very gripping, in a quiet way.

It felt like every other page where the time or place would shift without warning, but it really fit with the story. It was not difficult to follow, but at times it felt cryptic. What happened in Honduras? What is the real story with Brendan Bell? What are other skeletons hiding in Duncan MacAskill's closet?Secondly, there is a serious subject matter of sexual abuse and the cover ups, but the book covers concepts like post-traumatic stress, struggle of faith, temptations, suicide, violence, addiction, and loss of control just to name a few.

I've always admired Linden MacIntyre as a journalist and assumed he would have an ideally balanced perspective, of both compassion and acuity, for such controversial subject matter as the sexual abuse scandals associated with the Catholic church. That admiration and confidence in the author's vision still didn't give me the stomach, though, for a story so closely ripped from the headlines, with the news of more allegations against another Catholic priest hitting right around the time \"The Bishop's Man\" was longlisted, then shortlisted for the coveted Giller Prize. Long past the time that the book won the prize, I've finally read it, and am glad I did.The voice of Father Duncan MacAskill is dry at first, blandly and reticently stating the facts of his acknowledged work within the Catholic church, among parishes in the Maritimes, as something of a fixer for the bishop. His more benign moniker is \"The Bishop's Man\", but many of his fellow priests refer to him as the \"Exorcist\" for his behind-the-scenes work defusing situations and relocating men of the cloth who have strayed into various forms of scandal. He questions his role and his own faith as the job entails not only covering up unsavoury situations, but also increasingly includes running interference with communities, families, the police and media.Father MacAskill's words and observations may be spare at first, but they are not unaffecting. As he joins a new parish close to his birthplace and slowly establishes new connections and re-establishes dormant family connections, his is not the voice of someone who doesn't care, but that of someone who has cared much too much and is shell shocked by what he has seen and experienced. As he gets thrust more and more reluctantly into situations that test his conscience, he learns harshly that things not what they seem, in what unfolds dramatically before him in the present, but also in pivotal chapters of his own past life.In the end, the bishop's man realizes with some relief and humility that he is just a man, but also beholden to neither the bishop and what the bishop represents, nor to anyone else. That realization leaves much unknown for MacAskill at the end of the book, but leaves the reader glad to have seen him along his journey."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3377268-bill", "userReview": "The relaxed pace of MacIntyre's prose matches the setting of the novel - a boating community coast of Nova Scotia. He feels no need to rush the story, as he slowly introduces us to the characters and the situation that slowly suffocates the personal life of Father Duncan MacAskill. I enjoy this type of skillful writing, where the author slowly leads the reader deep into the narrative, giving him time to exist and understand this world. The strengths of the prose might explain my disappointment with much of the novel. The story is not nearly as powerful as the style. MacIntyre seems to have a good grasp of human politics in family and religion, with the need to cover up scandal in order to put forward the best product possible. He does not convey and notion of what faith looks like. This is where the novel falls apart. The devout priests that we meet are only devout out of a sense of social justice, not out of any deep longing for connection with God. There isn't any compelling evidence as to why Father Duncan would feel \"called\" to the priesthood. There is no call heard throughout the novel.Despite the lack of faith present in the novel, I would have been content enough had the story taken me to a satisfying conclusion. Instead, this leisurely paced novel has a rushed finale, tying up loose ends like this were an episode of a mediocre T.V. drama. The characters and reader deserved better than this.Still, the overall pacing and \"placing\" of the novel yield this recommendation.

The novel is set in the late 1990s of Cape Breton, at a time when the Catholic Church is under siege both from within and without, and when Canada\u2019s fisheries are collapsing. Come into this Father Duncan MacAskill, known among his colleagues as the \u2018Exorcist\u2019, the damage-control man for the Bishop of Antigonish.Duncan himself is in need of damage control, burned out, over-stressed, searching for his own relevance in a Church with diminishing relevance. There is very much the feeling of shadows in this novel, of whispers in the wind, of the reluctance to acknowledge hurt, tragedy, and responsibility. I know of many editors, even writers, who would have condemned the first half of this novel as too introspective, too slow, that the character of Duncan MacAskill is too remote.They would be wrong. As was I. What Linden MacIntyre creates with this cool, distant approach is a fragile foundation he then, in the last few chapters, ruthlessly, and yet with grace, rips out from under the reader\u2019s metaphorical feet and leaves you numb, in my case weeping.

But it was an interesting and unusual perspective on child molestation and the Catholic church, and it never got sordid, so points for that."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "I love Cape Breton literature, but this one wasn't one of my favorites.

I hoped he wouldn't. There was too much to explain. Too much to suppress. But he was moving slowly in my direction, using two canes now.'Hey,' he said. 'I was half expecting to get a call Sunday morning. Then they prayed for poor Willie at Mass. I figured you'd be too busy for boating.''One of these days,' I said.'I hear you're going away for awhile.''Yes. I was just picking up a few supplies.''Okay.''I'll be gone at least a month.' I told him I had a lot to think about. Maybe it was time for a major change of direction in my life.'That'd be a shame,' he said.'Nothing is decided.''You'll be back, though?''Yes.''Don't worry about the boat. I'll look after her for you. I've got good memories with that boat.'I thanked him.His face was suddenly very sad. 'What do you think goes through their minds?' he asked.'We can never know. We can only assume. That there was a moment at the end ... some kind of peace.'He nodded. 'It's a shame, you going. Priesthood needs more down-to-earth people like yourself.'I laughed.'I'm serious,' he said. 'People say that.''No matter what else I'll be, I'll still be a priest. You know what they say: once a priest, always a priest.''But you know what I mean. I'm not talking about ... theoretical.''You can think of me the same as now. I don't plan to change much.'He nodded.'Just don't call me Father any more.''That'll be hard,' he said. 'I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.' And he suddenly gathered both canes in his large left hand and extended his right for a farewell handshake. 'Just in case I don't run into you again.'Impulsively, I stepped forward and put both arms around his sagging shoulders, and my head alongside his where he wouldn't see my eyes.I remember standing like that for a long time, hanging on to his great weakened frame as he gently patted my back, the way you would a frightened child.And I remember the people going about their weekend shopping and glancing uneasily at two grown men hugging in a parking lot.

On the second page I decided I like Father Duncan MacAskill, the priest who tells his story with appealing humility and candor. Add to that the Maritime location, and by the third page, I was hooked.Father MacAskill is the priest the bishop calls on when there are uncomfortable confrontations to be made. He cleans up the mess made when a priest allows his baser urges to overpower his ideals. The bishop makes the decisions, but Father MacAskill does the dirty work, letting the guilty party know his activities have been discovered, in some cases accusations have been made, and where he's being banished to in consequence. He becomes known as the \"Exorcist\", a man most people are not happy to see on their doorsteps.When his own name is mentioned in relation to a past scandal, the bishop decides to get him \"out of the way\" and sends him off to a small parish in Cape Breton near where MacAskill grew up. In the solitude of his empty nights, his own troubled family life comes to the forefront once again. Pushed to the brink by his loneliness and unanswered questions, both about his own family and those of his parishioners, he takes solace in drink and the friendship of a local woman.The growing child molestation scandals in the church and his own apparent ineffectiveness in ministry cause him to question the very foundations of the beliefs he has built his life upon. Through his dark night of the soul he comes to understand that secrets never brought to light will never allow him to live in peace. As someone who is getting tired of books and movies that bash the church, I was reluctant to read this. Fortunately the author is a good writer and exercises restraint instead of depending on sensationalism to tell his story. There's a subtlety to his storytelling that I very much appreciate and makes me want to find out what else he's written. This one is definitely worth the read."}], "description": "Father Duncan MacAskill has spent most of his priesthood as the \u201cExorcist\u201d\u2014an enforcer employed by his bishop to discipline wayward priests and suppress potential scandal. He knows all of the devious ways that lonely priests persuade themselves that their needs trump their vows, but he\u2019s about to be sorely tested himself.While sequestered by his bishop in a small rural parish to avoid an impending public controversy, Duncan must confront the consequences of past cover-ups and the suppression of his own human needs. Pushed to the breaking point by loneliness, tragedy, and sudden self-knowledge, Duncan discovers how hidden obsessions and guilty secrets either find their way to the light of understanding or poison any chance we have for love and spiritual peace.", "title": "The Bishop's Man\n      \n          (The Cape Breton Trilogy #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7980835-the-bishop-s-man", "average": 3.72, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328744972l/7980835.jpg", "reviews": 436, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/419033.Linden_MacIntyre", "name": "Linden MacIntyre"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7980835-the-bishop-s-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7146234-the-bishop-s-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6713808-the-bishop-s-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9886114-the-bishop-s-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7544366-the-bishop-s-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13073964-why-men-lie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822848-punishment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33197773-the-only-caf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2303951.The_Long_Stretch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2303948.Causeway"]}
