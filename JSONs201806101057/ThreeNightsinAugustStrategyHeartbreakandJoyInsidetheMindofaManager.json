It has seemed boring to me. In my one year as a 9 year old little leaguer I would sit down in the outfield because nothing was happening. Baseball lovers have contradicted me on this opinion and this book settles the question once and for all not in my favor. I had no idea how complex, complicated, subtle the game was. 3 Nights in August chronicles a 3 game series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs sometimes pitch by pitch from the view point of the Cardinals manager Tony La Russa. The amount of knowledge, thinking, planning, foretelling, analysis of accumulated data of previous performances and tendencies, consideration of current emotional states, etc., etc., etc. was eye opening to me. I learned what a hit and run is, who Albert Pujos is, that La Russa is fluent in Spanish, has a law degree, is vegetarian (\"I don't eat anything that had a face\")and funds animal rescue efforts. I learned that what pitch is thrown is determined by the inning, the count, the score, the outs and even who might be coming to bat two batters later; that the batters know all of this too and try to predict what is coming their way(I had thought they just got up there and tried to hit whatever showed up); and that even when the managers tell the pitchers or batters to do something specific they just don't follow instructions. I learned that many well paid players don't give it their all because it's just too much trouble and the extra $2M they would earn is unneeded after the $5M base pay. One star player even complained of why his team always \"had to play in the playoffs\" when he would rather have the season finished.So now I will have to read \"Money Ball\" and go to a baseball game with my friend Jon Klein and have him explain the intricacies of what is going on. So much to do, so little time."}, {"userName": "Brad Lyerla", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4384303-brad-lyerla", "userReview": "I write for a blog on the Chicago Cubs sometimes. The blog is owned by a fine writer named Joe Aiello. He recommended H.G. Bissinger's Three Nights in August, a widely admired account of a three games series between the Cardinals and Cubs in August of the 2003 season. It is very worthwhile. There are many reasons why. One is that Bissinger wrote it, in part, as a response to Michael Lewis\u2019 fantastically successful Money Ball. In that vein, Bissinger wrote in his preface:\u201cIn [the aftermath of Moneyball], managers are less managers than middle managers, functionaries whose strategic options during a game require muzzlement, they are only to effect the marching orders coldly calculated and passed down by upper management. It is wrong to say that the new breed doesn\u2019t care about baseball. But it\u2019s not wrong to say that there is no way they could possibly love it, and so much of baseball is about love. * * * Just as they have no interest in the human ingredients that make a player a player and make a game a game: heart, desire, passion, reactions to pressure. After all, these are emotions and what point are emotions if they can\u2019t be quantified?\u201dOne of Bissinger's themes is that baseball is about human beings, including things that go on inside a player's heart and mind that cannot be quantified by sabermetrics. He argues this point by recounting many examples of how Tony LaRussa, the Cardinals manager at that time, had to wrestle with the human side of his players' characters in order to get them to perform at their best. Bissinger's account is compelling, but to be sure, that is no refutation of saber metrics. Modern analytics do not ignore human psychiatry. Indeed, all of the player is baked into the analytics, or so the saber metricians would be quick to argue.Three Nights is so good that I cannot believe that it took me this long to read it. There are many other fascinating interwoven story lines. LaRussa\u2019s take on JD Drew is interesting and seems on the money. The juxtaposition of Rich Ankiel's pitching troubles with Mark Prior's fate-tempting arrogance is eerie. LaRussa's terrible family life is an eye opener. For the first time, I feel a little sorry for the guy. There is a vignette about pitchers throwing at batters and the manager's role. That discussion is terrific too. I have only one complaint about this fine book. The ending is weak. For some reason, Bissinger jumps to the Cardinals loss in the 2004 World Series for his epilogue, instead of wrapping up the 2003 season. This was illogical and did not work for me. But there are many more good things about the book than bad. Any baseball fan will love it and I recommend it highly."}, {"userName": "Lance", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8511956-lance", "userReview": "Rating is more 3 1/2 as while it was great insight into the traditional three-game series, I felt is was a little too rah-rah and that readers who are not Cardinals fans would get a little tired of it. While listening to it, it seemed like even when the Cubs won a game, manager Tony LaRussa and pitching coach Dave Duncan could do no wrong. If anything did go wrong, it was the player's fault. But for hardcore baseball strategy and action, this book is very good."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9500046-dan", "userReview": "Before the glossing over of Tony La Russa's reputation inevitably takes place when he is enshrined in Cooperstown, it is important to note that he was perhaps the most polarizing manager in baseball during his career (with Dusty Baker also being a strong candidate in my mind).3 Nights in August chronicles a 2003 Cardinals-Cubs series near the end of the season. However, the book does not solely focus on those three games, as it also chronicles La Russa's career with the Carlton Fisk and Tom Seaver White Sox and the Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire (along with Rickey Henderson) Oakland A's. The book also focuses on La Russa's previous seasons with the Cardinals, most notably the 2002 season that was marred by the death of star pitcher, and popular teammate, Darryl Kile mid-season. It chronicles the unexpected rise of Albert Pujols and the fearsome trio he formed with Jim Edmonds and Scott Rolen in the mid-2000s.While this book will be most appreciated by Cardinals fans, any fans who enjoy baseball, or even Bissinger's previous works such as Friday Night Lights, would probably find some merit in this book. If there are any downsides Three Nights in August, it is that Bissinger sometimes paints La Russa in too much of a saintly light, when the real truth is that La Russa is more similar to Bill Belichick in his demeanor, with probably more negatives that are more apt to get exposed over a 162-game season.Also, it forces Cardinals fans to live the disappointing 2003 season over again, where mediocre pitching befell the team to 85 wins and a third-place finish (Esteban Yan and Pedro Borbon Jr. are still epynomous with the word \"suck\" when it comes to relievers). On the positive side, there is an epilogue devoted to the 105-win 2004 season, where the Cardinals advanced all the way to the World Series (it is a shame that they cancelled it that year)."}, {"userName": "Jason Phillips", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12426487-jason-phillips", "userReview": "You should buy this book for what it is, and not for what many of these reviews say it is. It is not anti-Moneyball, it is an insiders look at a baseball game in the context of the baseball world and the career of one man, Tony LaRussa. Sabermaniacs have brought a deeper understanding of baseball to the layperson, and have challenged conventional thinking about our great game. This book does not set out to refute ther tenets of sabermetrics, in fact, Moneyball is mentioned only three times in 279 (paperback) pages. Any anti-sabermetric review is probably motivated by an almost zealous subscription to the central teachings of Moneyball.Take the book for what it is: an intelligent, thought-provoking, entertaining, insiders look at the baseball world broken down into three games. There is a great deal of context given here for what is happening on the field and in the mind of the manager. As Mr. LaRussa points out in his Foreward, the book is not about three games, and that most of what you will read \"should really be about baseball in general.\"As far as recent books, the excellent Moneyball's contribution to the avid baseball fan is thinking differently about the assumptions you make about the game, and that different business models can be adopted that offer advantages that can be observed as teams take the field. The contribution of this book is an insiders look at how the game is tactically executed and how the eyes, ears, and experiences of a quarter century affect the minute decisions that affect the whole.Entertainingly written, any baseball fan will enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "globulon", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2313534-globulon", "userReview": "I give this 4 stars because the stars are about subjective reaction and I enjoyed reading it. On the other hand, I can definitely see you getting less mileage out of this book if aren't a fan of LaRussa, the Cardinals, or baseball, or even if you know a lot about the game. I also don't see this as having much staying power over time.That being said, I think I would describe this book as \"effectively wild\" a term he uses to describe Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood. There are plenty of overwritten sentences, and even unintelligible metaphors, but overall I still found the book interesting and even exciting. Of course, I am a LaRussa, Cardinals, baseball fan. I'm also a fan that is ignorant enough to learn something from this book. I found there to be plenty of good explanation in it, although I can imagine for some people I know the explanations might seem boring.The last point I want to bring up is its relationship to \"Moneyball\". \"3 Nights...\" argues against the sabermetric revolution to some degree. I found the argument subtle in the sense that although does make the point explicitly at times he never let's it distract from the main story line of the book. So I found this angle added something to my appreciation to the book. Despite evidence that personally Bissinger is a douche, his point of view in this book is well presented."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2695621-paul", "userReview": "Tony LaRussa is one of the greatest managers in the history of Major League Baseball. This book offers a unique glimpse into the mind of a baseball genius. \"Buzz\" Bissinger, the author of the football classic turned box office hit \"Friday Night Lights\", follows TLR and my favorite team, the St. Louis Cardinals, around during a series against the much-maligned Chicago Cubs towards the end of the Cardinals extremely disappointing 2003 season.I admit that I am totally biased in giving this book five stars. Saying I am a fan of the Cardinals is quite an understatement (as I type this, I am staring at an Albert Pujols bobblehead on my desk, and sitting next to a Cardinals' trash can I've had since my eighth birthday).

The amount of work that LaRussa put into a Pre-season, a season, and even single games is incredible. It was always reassuring to me, as a Cardinal's fan, that he was never going to be out prepared by the other team's manager.

Just beautiful baseball.***Growing up in Texas I didn\u2019t pay much attention to baseball. In Texas football is the only sport that matters, see Friday Night Lights by Buzz Bissinger. Once a year my grandmother would take me to an Astros game at the Astrodome, and that was the extent of my exposure to baseball as a young girl. Until I met B. When I first met B and he told me his favorite thing to do was to watch baseball I groaned. Watch baseball? Wasn\u2019t that about as exciting as watching paint dry. Nothing ever happened in baseball. Boring! But during the years that I dated B he taught me the game. He taught me slowly. We started with the basic rules, then moved on to different batting stances, then defensive positions, then various pitches, etc. He would always quiz me about the game. After a few years he would make up scenarios and then ask me how the play should unfold. When I finally broke off the relationship the only positive thing I knew I took away from it was an understanding and respect for baseball.In 1996 I moved to St. Louis. The same year that La Russa arrived in St. Louis. I quickly learned that they don\u2019t call St. Louis Baseball Heaven for nothing. As football is to Texas, baseball is to St. Louis. It was not long before I considered myself a part of Cardinal Nation. I spent many a car trip listening to Jack Buck call games on KMOX. I was at many the games during the season McGwire sent home runs to Planet Maris. I was at the NLCS game 4 against the Mets where Ankiel threw the wild pitches. I was the NLCS game 7 when the Cards beat the Astros to advance to the 2004 World Series. I was the final game of the 2006 World Series to see the Cardinals win it all. I was in Busch Stadium after the World Series victory parade in 2011 to see what would be La Russa\u2019s last public appearance as the Cardinals skipper. (Wouldn\u2019t B be jealous?)Since its publication I always knew I would read Three Nights in August. When La Russa retired I decided I should read it sooner rather than later. La Russa has been, after all, the only Cardinals manager I\u2019ve ever known. Reading this book was a beautiful experience. Bissinger captures all the drama of each pitch, each inning, for three games against the Cubbies in August 2003. Before I met B I didn\u2019t understand that every pitch was a mini drama playing out. I didn\u2019t understand that a baseball was full of strategy, a thinking man\u2019s game. Bissinger gives you all that more. The behind the scenes look at this series only heightened my already high regard for La Russa. It gave me hope for Mike Matheny\u2019s future as the new manager. Baseball is about more than statistics. It\u2019s about more than wins and losses. It\u2019s about more than pitching and home runs. It\u2019s about more than big contracts and big money. Bissinger gets to the beautiful Gestalt heart of the game.Reading this book was also an emotional experience. I\u2019ll admit to cyring like a baby while reading the chapter D.K. A day or two after Buck died I took flowers and added them to the only memorial that compares Princess Di\u2019s outside Busch Stadium before boarding a plane to Alaska. In Alaska I met up with a girlfriend from Texas and her teenage son. On our third day there I went back to the hotel room where the son had been sleeping in all morning. He told me that one of the Cardinals had died. Yes, I said, Jack Buck died. No, he told me, it was Darryl Kile. That was how I heard about Kile dying in his sleep. My friend\u2019s son grew up and after two tours in Afghanistan died in his sleep in 2008. Yes, that chapter had me sobbing.I only have two very minor complaints about the book: Bissinger used the word bipolar frequently to describe players. Bipolar isn\u2019t cute or funny or inconsequential. Bipolar is more than simple moodiness or unpredictable behavior. It\u2019s a serious disease and when the word is used casually it always rankles me. And I wish he had given Jack Buck more than passing nod. I understand the focus of the book wasn\u2019t about the fans but Jack Buck was an important part of the Cardinals\u2019 mystique. Jack Buck was the Voice of the Cardinals \u2013 and always will be.To make a long review short, if you love baseball, beautiful baseball treat yourself and read this book."}, {"userName": "Matt Mccutchan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16794273-matt-mccutchan", "userReview": "I found the book 3 Nights in August, by Buzz Bissinger to be very good. Buzz Bissinger was the perfect person to write this book about the manager of the St. Louis, Tony La Russa. He has written books about different people and La Russa called Bissinger because he wanted him to write the book. They based the book on a three game series in August, but also had a lot more background. Bissinger had permission to go in the club house and talk with all the players during this three game series. He got to see everything for himself, so he got a good feeling about how it is to be in the clubhouse for the game. It gave him a great perspective to write the book. \tThe book is based on a three game series against the St. Louis Cardinals division rivals, the Chicago Cubs. It is meant to be based around La Russa and all the crazy decisions he has to make. It starts out by talking about La Russa\u2019s background, \u201cNo one else had won the Manager of the Year Award five times\u2026 The White Sox in 1983 when he was still in his Wonder Boy thirties, twice with the Oakland A\u2019s in 1988 and 1992 in his forties, and then with the Cardinals in 1996 and 2002\u201d (3). He was one of the best coaches of all time and he was one of the greatest at strategizing. La Russa prepared for every series the same way, \u201cHe is managing out of fear, preparing as if he had never managed before, striving to prove to the world that he possesses the combination of skills and essentials to the trade: part tactician, part psychologist, and part riverboat gambler\u201d (17). He was scared going into every series and had to prepare for ever series like it was his last. He never wanted to lose and would make bold moves to help his team win. La Russa had a ton of strategic moves to make like when to bunt, when to hit and run, things like that. La Russa also had to decide when a pitcher intentionally hit one of his guys, \u201cAnd then he told him to throw what is standard in situation like this, throw a breaking ball away so it looks like he\u2019s having a little control problem, then hit Gonzalez in the ribs with the next pitch\u201d (119). La Russa always stood up for his players. So if one of his players got hit, he would determine if the pitcher was trying to do it on purpose and if he thought he was, La Russa would hit one of their players back. This was not a bad thing; he was just standing up for his players. La Russa has a lot of things to overcome when managing a team, \u201cAnd then came a different sound altogether, the sound of ball against bone\u201d (217). The Cardinals best pitcher, who was scheduled to make the most important starts of the year got hit in the hand will pitching. He had a slight fracture in his hand and was out for four weeks. La Russa thought this was going to be hard to get through, but with La Russa making some bold decisions in his pitching rotation, he managed to keep his team winning even though his ace was hurt. La Russa did some great things as a coach and was one of the best coaches of all time.\tI really liked the book because I love baseball and I am a fan of Tony La Russa. The way the book was written made in very interesting. They based the book around a three game series, but went back in time to give the reader background knowledge. I found this confusing at sometimes, but for the most part I really liked this part. It gave you a ton of details behind everything and made me really connect to the book. The book really drew me in and since I really like baseball, I connected to the book really well. I really liked seeing how hard it can be managing a major league baseball team and how hard it is being a player. All the tuff decisions coaches have to make and all the time they have to dedicate to the game, really made me appreciate the game even more. I really like the book and would recommend it to other baseball lovers."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/953335-chris", "userReview": "This book was actually recommended to me quite some time ago in a list of professional development and leadership works. I purposely waited until October to read this because despite what people will tell you, October is about baseball first, Halloween second. I was never a big La Russa fan when he managed the Cardinals, and he did nothing to help his stature in my mind by disparaging my Yankees early in the book. As he described the rivalry between the Cards and the Cubs, he insulted the Yankees/Red Sox feuds referring to their battles as a \"tabloid-fueled soap opera about money and ego and sound bites.\" He alleges that the Cubs/Cards feuds are real, the struggle of the hard working common man. And let me be clear: when I say 'he' I refer to Tony La Russa, even though Buzz Bissenger is listed as author. It all about the man in the dugout with the rose colored glasses. Even though Tony pretends to not respect what he refers to as the \"high priced supermodels\" that are the Yankees, he betrays himself by repeatedly referring to Yankee Stadium as \"the stadium\" which only those who respect the Yanks do. I would not recommend this book as a book club selection on a business setting. Those who are not sports fans would be easily turned off. There is a great deal of in-game baseball decision making and minute detail that would turn many off. Being a fan of the diamond, I was intrigued by the chess match decisions that are made by competing managers. But many would not be. What I did like about this work is that it was not a tell-all hat you see from too many athletes and managers. Nor was this a day by day or season by season reflection of one person's life within the game. While certainly there was plenty of backstory included, this was a story of three days in the middle of the season: one series of significance against one team's arch nemesis. This book didn't end with a feel good story of winning the World Series. This was a story about a man trying to pull people together, to help them be the best versions of themselves. This is where the leadership aspect of this reflection comes in to play. Whether or not you are a sports person, as a leader, you will run into the same challenges: direct conversations, coaching and development, helping people overcome adversity, recognizing when people are not going to get it done.  La Russa is open about his failures. Not just between the lines and in the locker room, but mistakes he made in his personal life and the lives of his family. Another major takeaway from this book is that it is the antithesis of Moneyball. Where contemporaries of Billy Beane will focus on the numbers and stats, hey often lose the human side of the sport. La Russa talks about understanding what the numbers will say, it also understanding that there is a layer of humanity that cannot be accounted for in those numbers. How do you quantify clutch? This was another thing that certainly needs to be taken into account if you are a leader. Data tells you a lot. But it does not tell you everything. Relationships are often overlooked in leadership, and that failure can also lead a team, group or business in the wrong direction."}, {"userName": "Joe Hardy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59709012-joe-hardy", "userReview": "A good book and really gave some insight on what Tony la Russa and any manager has to go through on a daily basis. It shows just how hard some people take losing and what they will do to keep it from happening again. It shows the constant struggle of what to do during a game, like when to put in a pinch batter or when to pull out your pitcher and how sometimes the decision that is made doesn't result in a favorable outcome. How one tiny play, pitch or call can completely alter the course of the game and you can't do anything about it. This book shows the power that a manager has while also showing how powerless they are. Overall it is a very good well scripted book that shows just how tough it is to be a manager but also the reward that comes with it."}, {"userName": "Adam N.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4332333-adam-n", "userReview": "Three Nights in AugustA baseball bookIs baseball really more than a game? Well in the book Three Nights in August you will learn all about it. The author of the book is Buzz Bissinger. The genre of this nook is informational. This story takes place in 2005 right in the heart of the season at the new Busch Stadium. Some of the main characters are the manager of the Cubs, Dusty Baker and the manager of the Cardinals, Tony LaRussa. This book takes you through the joy heartbreak and strategy of a major league manager. It takes you through what goes through Tony LaRusssa\u2019s mind as he manages a series against the archrival Chicago Cubs. My rating of the book would have been 4.2 stars out of 5. I thought that it was a good book but it could have been a little bit better. The book Three Nights in August is a page-turner because it is suspenseful, filled with drama, and has a lot of action.One of the reason Three Nights in August is suspenseful is because you never know what is going to happen next. If somebody is going to slam into the catcher or hit a homerun to give his team the lead. I was always on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next in the story. I think that part of what made this a good book is because of the Cubs-Cards rivalry. This book was also filled with a lot of drama. You never knew what was going to happen next. If LaRussa would bring in a relief pitcher or if Dusty would make a counter move and bring in a pinch hitter. I never knew what was going to happen next and that is part of what I thought made it a good book. During one of the games you don know if Albert Pujols, the best hitter in the MLB will be ok to play. This part of the book fascinated me. The book takes you through all of the scouting that the St. Louis Cardinals do to ensure that they know the Cubs better than even they know. This is why I continued to read the book.This book also had a ton of action. One of these moments was \u201c he barrels into Matheny and does a full 360-degree pirouette.\u201d I thought this was a very tense moment in the book and I wanted to find out what happened. Was the runner safe or out. Another example is when LaRussa is deciding whom to put in the starting lineup. He thinks about Edgar Renteria who had to be helped out of the shower because of his bad neck spasms. I wondered weather he would put him in or keep him out.The book Three Nights in August is a page-turner because it is suspenseful, filled with drama, and has a lot of action. I connected with the book because I play travel baseball and have season tickets to the Cubs. I also learned that whenever I am mad about something that a manager does there is so much more thought that goes into it before he even thinks of making the move."}, {"userName": "Niral", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/690229-niral", "userReview": "If you are (as I am) a Cubs fan, this book won't be much fun to read. And yet, although I'm sure part of my dissatisfaction with this book stems from the fact that it's an unabashed shrine to Tony La Russa and all things Cardinal, I think we what really bugged me about it was how blatantly biased it is. Certainly, La Russa is a great manager. Any Cubs fan will agree. The problem here, though, is that the author is so genuinely in the tank for La Russa that every move described in the book frames La Russa as a genius and everyone else (except for his pitching coach, Dave Duncan) as incompetent. Even when a play goes awry, the story is that La Russa told the player the \"right\" thing to do and the player was too pig-headed to listen or just failed to execute. If he had just done what Oracle La Russa had said, the Cardinals would have won the game and every game that season. Maybe there was a truth-in-advertising problem here that I didn't pick up on until about 2 pages before the end of the book. I thought this book was going to be a unique look at the game of baseball through the eyes of a manager, using La Russa as a case study of a mindset in which all managers more or less engage. But in fact, I realized that this was actually a biography of La Russa. And because the author was commissioned *by* La Russa to write it, it's not surprising that all you end up with is filter-less praise for the guy. The book worked best when the author was giving profiles of individual players, such as J.D. Drew. Less compelling was the endless play by play and the odd, corny similes sprinkled throughout. The most frustrating thing was to see La Russa get a pass for his involvement and at least tacit support for the steroids era. He had McGwire on his team and eventually made him his batting coach, but all this warrants in the book is a couple paragraphs implying that unlike Canseco, McGwire was clean. No mention is made of his cowardly testimony in front of Congress. Maybe if you're a Cardinals fan you love this book, but for me it was a mildly insightful wasted opportunity."}, {"userName": "Zach Herman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2666399-zach-herman", "userReview": "Buzz Bissinger is a tremendously unlikable author, and Tony La Russa is an equally unlikable baseball manager. But somehow, Bissinger's book about La Russa is likable -- or, at least, entertaining enough to fill the afternoons of a chilly offseason.The buzz upon its release pegged \"Three Nights\" as a fawning tribute to La Russa's tactical and philosophical genius, but this is not a hagiography. Bissinger clearly admires La Russa and agrees with most of his old-school baseball principles, but he also devotes space to La Russa's troubled family life. The manager's borderline-obsessive behavior during the season is not glorified, but reported dispassionately.The book aims to deconstruct a crucial three-game series between the Cubs and Cardinals in 2003, but Bissinger seems caught in the middle a little bit. He offers some good insight into the unorthodox strategy and in-game maneuvering that made La Russa famous, but he also works hard to explain the game to readers who may be unfamiliar with it. As such, \"Three Nights\" may be more compelling for the novice than for the studied fan, despite its clear ambition to be an in-depth look at the game.Unfortunately, the narrative grinds to a halt whenever Bissinger chooses to interject the sanctimonious twaddle for which his writing is best known. He is an able reporter, but reading his analysis of what ails the game (You guessed it: greed!) is like listening to a child discuss \"Othello.\" Bissinger doesn't waste a lot of space railing against high salaries and selfish players, but it is noticeable when he does. He's simply out of his depth."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay", "userReview": "Bissinger takes sports writing up a notch. Yes, you can see the typical sports metaphors mixed in here, but there are more erudite ones as well. I enjoyed the stories, but was a bit surprised at how Bissinger jumped around. Some at bats are described in incredible detail over the three game series, while sometimes whole innings are mentioned in a sentence. And a lot of the text is about events that happened prior to the games in focus. While I understand writing some background stories, my only complaint with the book is that the tangential anecdotes often have little or no tie to the story. Bissinger covers steriods usage and the death of Cardinal pitcher Kyle earlier in the season, but it really doesn't impact these games. While well written, it could have included some more relatable stories. I grew up in rural Illinois on the dividing line between Cubs and Cardinals territory. And I've only lived in two other places, Chicago and St. Louis. This book really plays to my personal interests and memories. I remember the \"historic\" matchup of Sandberg versus Sutter, which is mentioned here, and Bissinger adds another alliterative matchup during this series -- Pujols versus Prior. Harry Carry would have pointed out that alliteration, Buzz doesn't take the bait, which is like holding off on a wicked curve.On audio, the narrator sounds a bit like the deep voice of the guy who narrates those NFL films. It gets you in the sports mood, expecting a battle of titans. This was a good choice for this book."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156878-jeff", "userReview": "A must-read for anyone who considers themselves a real baseball fan, especially if they followed the game closely in 2003."}, {"userName": "blakeR", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45836-blaker", "userReview": "I'm from St. Louis so I had heard about this book a while ago and just assumed it was sort of a standard puff piece for the Cardinals. Then recently a friend told me, \"No really, it's more than that and you should read it.\" So I did and I was quite impressed with the entire scope of the book, which pretty much examines the minutiae of baseball through the lens of a single three-game series between the Cardinals and Cubs in August of 2003. You don't necessarily have to be a Cardinal fan to enjoy this book. Cubs fans should also apply, as well as anyone who appreciates some of the finer strategy in baseball. I consider myself well-versed for a casual baseball fan, perhaps somewhere on the border between a casual and an obsessive fan. Thus it was quite a treat to gain insight into pretty much every facet of the game -- if Bissinger missed one I'm not aware of it -- from an individual at-bat to hit-and-run, from pitcher preparation to intentionally hitting a batsman, and all through the eyes of one of the most relentlessly intelligent managers in the history of the game.Bissinger weaves an impressive, labyrinth-like narrative that tells the story of the three-game series while frequently pausing to follow individual threads to their point of origin, then zooming back out to the overall narrative. These threads often consisted of the background of an individual player, or a specific type of player, and these were the parts where it was most rewarding to be a Cardinals fan, to learn some of the inside dirt on my favorite players from a decade ago. My main complaint with the book is Bissinger's writing style, which is almost always ostentatious and frequently pretentious. Admittedly this reaction could be colored by knowledge of his real-world personality; he's an unapologetic conservative in the bombastic style of Sean Hannity. But still, I think most objective readers can agree that some of his word choices, analogies and dated pop culture references are oftentimes distracting, which should never be the effect of good prose. Here are some examples so you can judge for yourself: Alou goes for it in his unbridled aggressiveness. He gets a swing on it, a pretty good swing -- a damn good one, actually. He fouls it straight back, meaning that he missed driving it by a matter of only inches. Stephenson throws another fastball, this one better located on the inside. Alou gets a swing on it, a pretty good swing -- a damn good one, actually. 61  Was it really necessary to repeat the same sentence? Dramatic effect is lost in the annoyance of reading it over again. He has the swagger that is the hubris of youth, taking his invincibility for granted when nobody ever should, receiving too much early attention and slathering in it. 75Now I could be wrong, but this just seems like the wrong word choice. You can't \"slather in\" something, you slather something onto something else. As far as I can tell he was looking for a word like \"wallowing.\" But this indicates that Bissinger's grasp on the English language is not as strong as he's representing, which makes some of his other word/phrase choices all the more pretentious. The pitch is more difficult to handle than the first one, that lethal combination of high-heat velocity and location you see sometimes on the Autobahn. 122 Tortured metaphor. What kind of location do you see on the Autobahn? What does that even mean? Bissinger also employed a strange and somewhat arbitary use of italics:Wood comes with a curve that bites low, and Taguchi has no choice but to protect himself because of the count, and he fouls that off too, his fifth in six pitches. 173Then there were just a couple of plain 'ol WTF moments:In addition, the relief game, of which La Russa may well be the key cultural anthropologist, had yet to evolve. 177So this means that La Russa studies the relief game and compares it to other sorts of games? That he studies relievers and analyzes their society and value systems? The analogy makes no sense, especially when he appears to be looking for a word as simple as \"inventor\" or \"inspiration.\" Another case of Bissinger trying to sound smarter than he really is. Then:(Lofton) is Kline's eternal nemesis, the psychotic ex-girlfriend who sends you creepy notes through the mail to remind you she's still around. 246First of all, the analogy of a psycho-ex does not really encapsulate what it means to be an \"eternal nemesis,\" so he starts off with a badly mixed metaphor. Secondly, are there really enough of these types of ex-girlfriends to make this a good universal example? Thirdly, it's just not an apt comparison at all to the relationship of Kline and Lofton, the latter of whom continually takes advantage of the mistakes of the former. It's just bad writing. I grant that I'm probably being extra hard on him just because I disagree with his politics and find him to be kind of a d-bag anyway, so take my criticism for what its worth. On the other hand, a decent writer can spot these sorts of mistakes a mile away, and the compound effect is to really do a disservice to the content of the book, content which is pretty near impeccable. The only other thing I would have changed stylistically is to not try and needlessly manufacture drama -- whether in one particular at-bat, or one particular game or series -- when the narrative is already plenty compelling. So overall, regardless of my writing quibbles I would recommend this book to Cardinals fans, Cubs fans and/or borderline obsessive general baseball fans who are interested in acquiring a finer grasp on the minute strategy behind even the most mundane baseball decisions. It is an invaluable artifact for its in-depth discussion of pretty much every aspect of the game.

At the time it came out, the book was set up in opposition to Michael Lewis' 'Moneyball', about Tony La Russa's former team, the Oakland A's, a couple of years earlier. Where the Billy Beane A's were mastermined by a data-driven approach, La Russa's Cardinals were shown to rely on a mix of preparation and desire. Bissinger is very subtle about it, however. La Russa occupies something of an intermediate position between the Moneyball A's and the matchup method described in Earl Weaver On Strategy, which describes managing some forty years ago. La Russa's Cardinals retain some elements of of Weaver's time, but have bought heavily into technology, just like the A's. The difference is that the Cardinals don't look so much at computed data as at video. The video room is where they hope to make a difference through technology, and to some extent I would say that, from the perspective of twelve years later, baseball's technological revolution has been more long-lasting in that form than via the methods described in Moneyball. The book is written quite engagingly, and switches between the game at hand and the background to it. Recommended to all fans of major-league baseball.

The thread of story telling not only included what was happening in Chicago during the series but also previous stories of a player or an issue that impacted \"today's\" decision in Tony's mind.All in all, my takeaway is that Tony was an MLB manager with a laser focus and an affinity for planning numerous if-then scenarios so he could be prepared for anything that arose late in a game.
