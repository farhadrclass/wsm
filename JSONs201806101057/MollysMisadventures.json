She suddenly realizes that her dreams may not be something she has moved on from and if that isn\u2019t enough. She finds out the boy next door that she spent her childhood crushing on is once again living next door and is still completely crushable.I use the word fun a lot on this blog, but rarely does a book personify a term as completely as this one.

In going back home, her goal is to get her dad situated with a home nurse and get back to her life as soon as possible and move on from her suddenly disastrous marriage. Her plan is complicated by the fact that her obnoxious dad has a reputation with home health care services and hiring a private nurse is not as easy as it would seem. It is complicated further by a pushy, but well meaning, best friend who has decided that the best thing for a broken heart is to get right back in the saddle, as she sets Molly on course that leads to several hilarious dating fiascoes. She also sets Molly up with a blog and a blogging class as she sees an opportunity to convince Molly that what she really wants is what she has always wanted, to be a writer. Muddying up the waters more, is the really hot guy next door and his adorable daughter, who seem to really want to be a part of her life. As Molly reels from one hilarious disaster to the next, she finds that her life may not be what she thought it was and that she has options she never dreamed of.The characters and relationships in this story are incredible. From the ease at which Molly reconnects with the boy next door to dealing with the strained relationship with her mother, the characters jump off the page and become real to the reader.

Molly\u2019s Misadventures was a fun, relevant, and humorous read that was well crafted, highly enjoyable, and exactly what I needed.

As an added wrinkle, when rushing home to pack, she finds her husband entertaining his secretary - with his pants at his ankles. I could not put my kindle down. I adored the snarky humor, inner musings and keenly observant revelations. Although, I wonder \u2013 being a cougarish and platinum tressed book blogger - should I be a bit piqued that she depicted the rest of her blogger class to be populated by \u201cgray and white headed\u201d ladies?

From the beginning where Molly comes home to see the asshat of a husband defiling her couch to her thoughts on her father\u2019s next door neighbor, the bedazzling fiasco and dates from heck. Even the blogging classes with the old ladies especially the one who reads erotic novels this story is so entertaining.Molly is a provider. That is what she does. She provides for herself. She is self sufficient but she also is afraid. Afraid of failing at something she loves. When her marriage goes south thank you asshat and I do mean thank you because if it hadn\u2019t we never would have had the sexy danny, the date where she ends up with the Kama Sutra book or the boss dilemma. From the beginning this story is entertaining and the fun never ends.When Molly has to go home to help her dad is when the fun really kicks up. Her dad really is Mr. Grumpy pants but it is the interactions with her neighbor that keeps this story great. That and Molly\u2019s misadventures that she writes about on the blog that her friend pushed on her. Those adventures are a hoot. The disastrous dates are ones all can relate too. The blogging class with the funny sweet old ladies is a hoot. the sweet dates and wooing from the neighbor boy who Molly has crushed on in high school are sweet. I love the evenings they have on the swing talking. This is his wooing and boy is he wonderful.Danny had a bad marriage but came out of it with a sweet precocious nine yr old girl who captures your heart. So does Danny. He is supportive and honest with Molly. You don\u2019t get a trumped up version. what you see is what you get with him and boy is it a awesome package. He slowly woos Molly and has her thinking of changing careers and places to live. He gives her love and attention something she lacked in her marriage. He also gives her respect and honesty.this is the fun entertaining story of Molly and how she finds a new career and love.

Why? Because OMG it was so funny. No, not funny, FUNNY in all caps because it is laugh out loud funny in some places.This is kinda chick lit but with a slightly more mature heroine. After all, chicklit is about twentysomethings and Molly is more a thirtysomething.Molly is the kind of heroine that you will love and feel sorry for. I mean she walks in on her hubby doing the nasty with his secretary on her couch.YikesThen there's her dad. Again, OMG! Her dad will have you laughing too. He's kind of like Archie Bunker. He can't keep a nurse because he is well...totally uncensored. The only issue I had with dad was a bit of a research issue. My dad had COPD and was on oxygen. To the best of my knowledge most people that are on O2 24/7 do not have tanks that need to be changed. They have a compressor. So technically her dad didn't need a nurse that came every day. But I'll ignore that, because I really loved the story so much.Danny, her crush/love interest was perfect. Loved him. Best hero ever. He was just a fun guy and I loved his daughter too. Maybe he was too perfect and accepting, but this is fiction and I want a guy like him.Then there are the ladies at the blogging class. OMG! (really the OMGs are all necessary) So funny. Again, we all need people like them in our lives. I think the world would be a much happier place.The best part of this book are Molly's blog posts. They are hilarious.

Her sarcastic biting wit and innate sassiness really make her a great character. Molly's father, her friend Dianne, and the \"boy next door\" Danny are also enjoyable characters. Their interactions keep the laughs coming from beginning to end. Through the course of this book, we see Molly grow, finding a new career and a new love.

Don't believe me? Read up a about her misadventures and all your doubts would be cleared up. This book was certainly one of a kind to read and one that you would definitely enjoy. The humor starts right from the point where she sees her \"loyal\" husband and his secretary on HER couch doing the nasty. What a cliche right? That's what Molly thought too. And when her father had represented accurately every type of homophobic patriarchal parent, I was absolutely was gripping this book so hard because, THANK YOU!! The fact that someone had represented how a homophobic character is, especially in a book, is amazing. But I have to admit, her father was indeed humorous. Danny was absolutely adorable and every scene with him and Molly were a bliss. I honestly wouldn't mind re-reading this book from Danny's POV and his lil girl was another blessing. She was such a cute character (And I couldn't even see her, wish I could though), her and Danny, right from their entrance managed to steal my heart.Molly's Blog was (obviously) the BEST part of the book and that means also topping over Danny's part (Sorry D!). Molly was hilarious in her blog and I adored it. She was perfect in every way. I also loved her classmates in the blogging class and Yes, I probably need to hire Chris too.The only reason this is rated 4 Stars is because I'm disappointed that the chapters were extremely small and if that could be improved, Then God send help, D.E Haggerty is coming to destroy everyone's hearts with her amazing writing!!** I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review, all thoughts are my own **"}, {"userName": "Barb Taub", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1623531-barb-taub", "userReview": "In Molly\u2019s Misadventures, author D. E. Haggerty efficiently nails almost every chick lit trope out there. * Heroine with high-powered job but crap love-life? Check. Having chucked her dreams of becoming a writer in favor of the high salary and chance to work for great boss and friend Blake, Molly only has two problems. One is her mean, foul-mouthed father she is dutifully caring for, and the other is her very-soon-to-be-ex husband. \u201cEvery time I closed my eyes, I saw a vision of Darryl\u2019s naked, flabby ass pumping into his secretary. I didn\u2019t want to see that once, let alone over and over again in my dreams.\u201d * Tries the Wrong Guy first? Check. See the naked, flabby ass in #1. * Thinks she\u2019s ugly (but every guy she meets falls madly in love with her)? Check. Molly must have the glittery-est hooha ever because every guy she\u2019s ever met\u2014from her secret high-school crush to the got-it-all-going-on husband of a close friend\u2014is secretly in love with her. * Thinks she\u2019s smart, but has the people-judging skills of the disposable blonde teen in a slasher movie? Sadly, Check. We\u2019re told Molly is smart (University of Chicago t-shirt), but her lack of almost any interpersonal judgement has her drifting through the pages in a perpetually confused fog. * Mommy Issues & Daddy\u2019s Girl? Check. Molly\u2019s parents have been divorced for years. Despite the fact that her father is a self-absorbed, sexist, foul-mouthed tyrant, Molly is still his Little Princess. Plus he\u2019s still preferable to her mother\u2019s brand of hyper-critical communication.Not-Actual physical flaw such as Frizzy Hair? Check. \u201cMy hair is a rat\u2019s nest at the best of times. Combing through my wet hair without the use of generous portions of conditioner is like trying to perform an exorcism without a priest.\u201c * Funny? Okay, Check! Molly\u2019s observations on her world are occasionally laugh out loud funny and often painfully amusing. My favorite paragraph in the book is one we\u2019ve all lived. I hate renting cars. What are they doing all the time behind the counter on the computer? They have my information already, yet they spend an eternity typing away and pressing buttons anyway. It sounds as if the agent is typing about a million words a minute. And I wait and wait some more. How many times will the sales agent ask if I want additional, outrageously expensive insurance before I punch him?Maybe that\u2019s the whole point\u2014to see who will lose their cool first and start throwing punches? When I\u2019m reviewing a book, I often go down a little list of things to consider. In Molly\u2019s Misadventures, the pacing is sure, a brisk march to an obvious finish. The writing is terrific, often funny and entertaining, and with a great balance between dialog and the snarky comments in Molly\u2019s head. Molly\u2019s character is nicely developed, and shows a respectable growth though the book.But the plot of Molly\u2019s Misadventures does have some obvious flaws. One that I found particularly annoying is that Molly is kind of\u2026well\u2026mean. When her supposedly good friend\u2019s husband confesses that he\u2019s always been in love with Molly, her immediate reaction is along the lines of Well, I always knew she was a bitch so let\u2019s throw her under the bus\u2026 And her continuous dates with all the Mr.Wrongs\u2014while amusing\u2014never show any sympathy or compassion for others on the same search as herself. Not only does this reveal that Molly is both clueless and shallow, but the introduction of a completely gratuitous love triangle seems more like the author almost got to the end of her Chick Lit checklist and said, \u201cDamn, I almost forgot the Deceptively Perfect Potential Love Interest. My bad.\u201d Also, I hope it\u2019s not just blogger-jealousy that makes me feel that the instant financial and social success of Molly\u2019s frankly mean-spirited mess of a blog is also a pretty big pill for the reader to swallow.But overall, Molly\u2019s Misadventures is exactly what it looks like\u2014a humorous, entertaining, fast-paced, predictable romantic comedy. While I could wish that writer D.E. Haggerty had addressed a few of my issues with her plot, the amusing and entertaining Molly goes a long way to make up for that. I would give it four stars, and happily reach for another book by this author.**I received this book for free from the publisher or author in exchange for an honest review.

Haggerty is a new author to me and I found this delightful, romantic comedy to be simply light, fun and a joy to read! From the first chapter when Molly finds her asshat husband banging his secretary on their couch, her grumpy, cantankerous father who scares away his nurses, to her discovery that the boy next door, Danny, who she had a major crush on when they were kids, felt the same way about her, I was hooked. Her friend, who wants to set her up on dates, convinces her to write a blog on her experiences of the dates she goes on from a dating APP and OMG are they hilarious! Molly seems to attract every conceivable loser in town! Danny has a very precocious 9 year old daughter who wraps \u2018Miss Molly\u2019 around her little finger and as the days turn into weeks, Molly gets firmly entrenched into their lives. There are little side stories about the funny gray haired ladies in her learning to blog class, a boss demanding she return to her job and him, and with getting to know her mother better. There is some sexual tension going on between Molly and Danny, but this story is not about sex, it is about a second chance at love for both of them and finding it with each other! I highly recommend this fun, lighthearted story by D.E. Haggerty!ARC provided by author in exchange for an honest review.

I am a cover whore, I admit I click on the pretty ones but I also click on the covers that look unique. Molly\u2019s Misadventures is that UNIQUE!!!\u201cI watch the other passengers run to the gate, as if boarding an airplane is a race. We're all taking the same aluminium tube in the sky and landing at the same time, idiots.\u201dMolly has just been bamboozled, catching her douche of a husband banging his secretary in their home. Not hanging around for pleasantries Molly packs and leaves to go and help her grouchy father.\u201cWas I seriously going to stand there and watch my husband get off with his secretary? Um, no, I don\u2019t think so. I waked over to the couch and did the only thing I could think of. I slapped his ass --- hard.Enter the boy next door, Danny!!!Danny, is a single dad raising his daughter, whom Molly has had a major crush on since high school. Somewhat 10 years later he is as good looking as then now. Danny is total dream worthy he loves hard and starts to woo Molly without her even realizing it.I found MMA to be a slow to burn romance, with a very low angst story and some slight twist and turns to keep you invested. But this was not enough for me, I wanted more romance between the two. I felt it was to drawn out. This tale is told in Molly\u2019s POV, her snarky humour was pretty funny and her crazy best friend was really great supporting character.\u201cCan I go blind from rolling my eyes too much?\u201dSo does Molly give up her awesome life in NYC?

What a surprise when she finds her husband having sex with his secretary on her couch. Okay that part isn't fun but it gets really funny as it goes on. Molly goes to her father's house (where she grew up) and while she is interviewing nurses for him she connects with her old friend Dianne. She encourages Molly to start dating and writing since she knew that was something Molly always wanted to do. Dianne sets up a blog for Molly to help her get started writing. That lead to Molly taking a class on blogging which turns out to be so funny because of the other students. They are all seniors who bearly know how to turn on a computer let alone write a blog. Helpful (?) Dianne signed Molly up on a dating website. Knowing Molly couldn't fight Dianne on this she went on some dates and wrote about them on her blog. Then there's Danny who has lived next door since they were kids and Molly always had a crush on him. Now that he is a man, she's even more attracted to him.I love D. E. Haggerty's books but this one just wasn't as captivating as the others. Don't get me wrong, it's good and I enjoyed it but it just wasn't as enticing as I expected. I love the cover of Molly's Misadventures. It's different and eye catching.The characters are wonderful and very believable. Danny was perfect and we can easily see why Molly likes him so much. The ladies in the blogging class were a hoot. I liked how Molly made the best of a bad situation but I didn't like how she was so obsessed with Danny's body. That didn't go with her personality. She had been married 10 years and worked 80 hour weeks in New York so she didn't seem to be interested in her husband. Work seemed to be the most important thing to her so why was she suddenly so obsessed with a man's body and having him?I received this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/967904-christy", "userReview": "Molly's Misadventures tells the story of Molly, a married woman in her 30s who works as personal assistant to multi-millionaire, who rushes home one day to prepare to fly out of town to help her ailing father, only to find her husband screwing his secretary on their lovely couch.She loved that couch.Molly flies home to Wisconsin, where she hasn't been in years, and reconnects not only with old friends, but with the cute boy next door she had a crush on while growing up. Of course, he's not a boy anymore...divorced, with a daughter, Danny is as good looking and irresistible as ever.Encouraged by her friend Diane and Danny to start writing as she always said she would do while growing up, Molly starts a blog. Her \"misadventures\" in dating (because of course, she is now divorcing her husband) make up the bulk of her blog posts.What I liked - good writing, and as always, D.E. Haggerty infuses humor throughout the story. As one who has done the online dating thing, I could identify very much with the disastrous dates that Molly goes on. Yes, things like what happen to Molly DO happen in real life.However - and yes, I know this is a book. Yes, I know I am a divorced, still dating woman in her 40s. Things went just entirely too smoothly, and quit frankly too quickly, for Molly. Most women date for years before finding someone else that they make a connection with. They suffer many - MANY - heartbreaks in that time as well. So, as much as adore D.E. Haggerty as an author, I think she missed the mark on what dating in your 30s is like in this day and age - though she did hit the mark on exactly WHAT you meet when you do the online dating thing.Fun read that will keep you entertained for a few hours when you need it. 3 1/2 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9300716-diana", "userReview": "Wow I totally love this book. Molly\u2019s Misadventures is so fantastic. I laughed all the way through, well not the serious parts though. I loved the way the author D.E. Haggerty wrote this story; it is totally a way I wish I could write. But I can\u2019t write, I can barely write a book review.Molly\u2019s character is great, love her point of view on things. She would be a great friend to have.The book starts out with Molly receiving a call that her dad fired his nurse again and she needed to go home to deal with him. So her boss immediately got her a flight out of NYC and had his driver take her home to get packed and when she walks in the front door, her nice sweet hubby is banging his secretary on the couch OMG!!! Just what she needed, and she didn\u2019t have time to deal with him at that moment she needed to catch a plane. She is back in Wisconsin dealing with her grumpy dad and her friend decided to sign her up for a dating site, nice friend. Her friend also decided she needed to blog about it as well. The blog is awesome!!! I wish I could write a blog like she did. Ok back to the story, just a quick few things, the neighbor boy she grew up with is living next, HOT!!!! Oh and the dating site, you will have to read the book to find out about that. I don\u2019t want to give any more info but if you want to read a really witty and fun story, that you won\u2019t want to put down, or at least I didn\u2019t want to put down this story then this is a good one.

Instead of having the breakdown she deserves, her best friend from home talks (more like forces) her into online dating and then blogging about it. Oh, ya, and don't forget about the hottie childhood crush that lives next door!! Put all of that together and hilarity ensues.The characters are sweet, funny, and endearing. She made them relatable. Sure, you may not be going through the same things they were but the situations felt natural, as did the characters reactions to them.I found myself really connecting with Molly. She totally cracked me up and she was strong, sassy, and driven. She was a fabulous female lead. And don't get me started on Danny! That man was just...sigh.D.E.

The description of this book alone pique my interest and I was not disappointed. Here we have Molly, a married 30 something woman that comes home early one day and finds her husband in a comprising situation. She leaves him and goes back to her hometown to deal with her ill father and ends up running into her high school crush; who has only gotten better with age. Even though she is still a married woman, she cannot deny the attraction she has for him (Danny) after all these years. From the first page and until the last, this book grabs your attention and does not let go.

It was a good book and I liked it but I got bored becaue the story itself is not uniqe and it felt like I have read the book before even if I hadent. The book is well written and there is a clear storyline so it is easy to follow. I can see that a lot of people love this book and I can understand it even if it wasnt exactly what I wanted. I like D.E. Haggertys way of writing and know I will read more from her. If you like romantic comedies and want a quick read, this is a book for you.

From the first page till the last one, I couldn't put this book down. I laughed and moaned with the author as Molly went from one adventure to another. I couldn't help but love her as the author flushed her out to a totally believable person. She has all the problems most 30 year olds have in today's society and tackles everything head on. Her love life took a major dump with a jerk of a husband. This is a kind of coming of age or growing up book. I was wondering about her relationship with her boss, and wasn't surprized by the confession of him. I thought the boy next door Danny couldn't have been more perfect. I kept looking for flaws and his daughter, lol what a jewel. I worried there for awhile that Molly's judgement was going to go against what I wanted, but glad to see she kept her common sense.
