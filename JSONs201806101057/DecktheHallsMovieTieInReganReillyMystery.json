"userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light", "userReview": "I have enjoyed Mary Higgins Clark's other books and with Christmas just around the corner, this seemed to be a good pick.Plot:Regan Reilly, a private investigator in California, is the daughter of funeral director, Luke Reilly, and famous mystery writer, Nora Reilly. Alvirah Meehan, an amateur detective, was a former cleaning lady and a winner of the lottery. When someone looking for 1 million dollars decides to kidnap Luke and his chauffeur, Rosita, these two women must brace the impending windstorm and rescue them--before the boat they are kept on sinks.Good:Lacking in more quantities than I have hair follicles (and people are always complementing me on my thick hair), this book is none-the-less fast-paced and funny (although most of the times inadvertently). The last 100 pages of this slim read whip by--and that isn't just because the writing is about as challenging as a Boxcar children book. There is a lot of action and intense sequences. And while most of the humor made my eyes roll instead of my belly laugh, sometimes a clever joke would crop up and smile creep across my face.Bad:I can not believe that someone of Mary Higgins Clark's caliper wrote this! This is so disgusting that I wanted to \"Deck\" someone's Halls!1. WRITING STYLE:* Number 1 bad thing missing from this \"mystery\" is: subtlety. It was Mary Higgins Clark's trademark in previous books. Instead, the audience is whacked vehemently over the head with a Christmas tree (or a bell or a Christmas tree ornament) whenever a point is to be made. C.B. is a bad guy...he acts strange around his uncle's body. Whack! Jack is going to be Regan's woman...Nora gushes about how much her husband would love her future son-in-law. Whack! Fred is a great guy...and doesn't mind watching the children of a woman he has dated all of two times. Whack! Rosita likes Fred--she's always calling herself \"Cinderella\". Whack! The bad guys relate their entire scheme--who, what, when, where, and why--to their kidnapees. Whack! Whack! Whack! I just wished that I had a wall to hit into. Or a quarter for every time I rolled my eyes. I'd never have to work again!* Characters are introduced in the same way each time: with a paragraph or ten describing every aspect of the character. I mean, here's the first paragraph of Jack Reilly's introduction: \"Jack Reilly had sandy hair that tended to curl, hazel eyes more green than brown even features with a strong jaw and a broad-shouldered, six-foot-two body. Keenly intelligent, quick-witted, and with a sharp sense of humor honed by growing up in a large family, he had undeniable charisma. Both at social gatherings and at work, his laid-back presence somehow filled the room...\" This was good--when I was ten and reading The Babysitters' Club. But mature writers know the real secret to good novels: show your audience *Fill in the blank*, don't tell.2. CHARACTERS: I should say actually \"Caricatures\". Not one character in this book could be described with more than one (okay, maybe two words). I'll prove it.Regan: attractive, smartNora: helplessLuke: braveRosita: momJack: copFred: princeAlvirah: annoying (okay, \"detective\")Petey: stupidC.B.: criminal \"mastermind\"Let's start at the top. Regan has about as much personality as a cheese slice wrapper. For someone supposedly smart and a private investigator, she doesn't do a whole lot of smart things or even investigating. She'd rather think about romancing the man she met ten seconds ago and leave the investigating to someone else. Nora shouldn't have even been included--her little \"Luke would like my future son-in-law\" bit was inappropriate and stupid. Luke is flatter than pancakes. Rosita calls herself \"Cinderella\" to a man she barely knows? Yeah, right. Jack is said to be oh, so many things (charismatic)--but I never saw him act that way. Fred has no problem staying with two kids he barely knows--he only dated their mother twice!--over going to a party. Yeah, right. And what kids would be okay with a guy they probably have met all of one time? Not me! Alvirah is like an annoying, know-it-all, irritating version of Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, and every other child's mystery story hero. She pops in and starts bragging about all the cases she's solved and acting like she owns the world. I don't see how anyone could stand her--she drove me nuts from her cheesy back story to her stupid \"sunburst pin\" cassette tape (that must be one heck of a small cassette--or one heck of a big pin!). And the bad guys are complete doofuses, which leads me to...3. PLOT: The audience knows from the moment they are introduced to The Bad Guys (which is on page 10) that there is no way in hell that Luke and Rosita will not make it out in time for Christmas. These guys are so dumb. Petey talks like a child. C.B. is so smart...all his ideas came out of the latest Sue Grafton or James Patterson novel! Whoopee! Not to mention that there really isn't any mystery. We meet The Bad Guys 10 pages into the book and are robbed of the only other means of asserting a mystery in this horrific holiday hoax--if The Bad Guys get away. However, all the \"Will *fill-in-the-blank* be home for Christmas?\" remarks are a dead give-away that the end will be another \"happily, ever after\". Lastly, the romantic element is cheesy, corny, and stupid. Fred wants to stick around Rosita after two dates and taking care of her kids for two days? Regan falls for Jack after two days during which her dad is kidnapped? I mean, come on.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Mild. Sparse usage of da** and other foul language. Hugh Hefner is brought up. Men hold guns.Overall:I cannot believe I would not like a Mary Higgins Clark book.

Regan\u2019s mom, mystery writer Nora Reilly, sustains a broken leg in a household accident.

This is an interesting and fun mystery. Of course, the reader always knows who the culprit is, but it\u2019s fun to watch the police, Regan and Alvirah arrive at the solution. They have plenty of suspects and follow several wrong leads, but I found their thought process as they examined various clues and red herrings interesting. I\u2019ve never read anything by either of these authors before, so the characters were completely new to me. But I never felt lost and the way they come together seemed plausible. I also thought the writing was seamless; I certainly couldn\u2019t tell if one section was written by Mary and another by Carol. All told, this is a quick, entertaining cozy with a satisfying ending.

I feel like I skipped from 8th grade graduation straight to high school graduation.The book itself is pretty simple, two amateur sleuths get together and with a group of friends save the day, just in the nick of time. What's different though, other than the setting, is that these two authors blend their voices seamlessly. There doesn't seem to be any conflict with where the story was going or any odd jumps in logic that sometimes comes with team ups. This is a light hearted mystery that even with the suspense never takes itself too seriously which allows the read to be fun. Now I'm not going to go into too much detail about the story itself, other than what I put in the synopsis, but I can say that more than one character finds love in this book and to answer my opening question, the only thing that may be better than a Christmas mystery is Christmas love."}, {"userName": "Shirlene", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5700960-shirlene", "userReview": "Luke Reilly owned 3 funeral homes. His wife, Nora, was a successful mystery writer. Their daughter, Regan, was a private investigator. Nora had tripped on a rug that Regan had given to her and broke her leg. Nora was now in the hospital. Regan had come to visit and Luke headed out to attend one of his funerals. The funeral was for a man that had left the majority of his estate to the Seed-Plant-Bloom-and-Blossom Society. His nephew, C.B., Cuthbert Boniface, was extremely upset. Rosita Gonzalez had two young sons she was raising alone and Luke had hired her to work for him. He found out that she drove limo's during her off-time and had asked her to become his chauffeur. She was now waiting outside the hospital to take him to the funeral. Someone knocked on the car window and she recognized a painter that had worked for Luke during the summer. Luke hadn't liked the work he had done and fired him. He had tried to date Rosita but she wasn't interested. She had recently had a couple of dates with a policeman, Fred Torres. He asked if he could sit in the car for a minute where it was warmer because he wanted to talk to Luke. She didn't see a problem and let him inside. She knew she had made a mistake when she turned around and saw him holding a gun. Luke arrived and got in the car. Rosita was told to drive and they picked up C.B. They continued on till they got to a rundown houseboat. They were taken inside and locked in. They were brought fast food and were told that they were going to be held for ransom. Regan was called and the kidnappers asked that $1 million be delivered to them in 24 hours by Regan. Regan happened to have gone by her father's dentist to meet him for an appointment. Alvirah Meehan was there with her husband. Alvirah had won the lottery and was an amateur detective. She gave Regan a ride home when her father never showed and Regan left her phone in Alvirah's car. The phone rang and Alvirah ran into her house with the phone. It was the kidnappers and Alvirah had a recorder on her and recorded the call. She had done some work with the police and knew just who to call for help, Jack Reilly. Jack was no relation to the Reilly family. They were looking for some clue to tell them who had taken Luke and Rosita and first looked to Rosita's ex. He was a gambler and was hard to locate. Fred had relieved the boys babysitter and was now staying with Rosita's boys. The Federal Reserve was getting the money together. The hardest part was the waiting. One of Nora's fans, Alvin Luck, had taken a really good picture of Luke and decided to give it to her as a present while she was in the hospital. He purchased a frame and delivered it to the hospital. He purchased a teddy bear to hold the frame at the hospital gift shop and asked that the gift be delivered in the morning. He didn't sign the card delivered with the gift and had no idea that it was taken as a threat by the police. He was hoping the gift would be received to get him attention as a writer but the police were checking the gift for fingerprints.The kidnappers were a bit inept and Alvirah tried to tell Jack that the kidnappers were following a story like from one of Nora's books. After Nora helped him along with a few of the directions that where given, he believed her. The drop off was made and picked up. Petey dropped the money in the river. The police had put a detector inside the bag of money so it was recovered. C.B. tried to cover what had happened by acting like he knew there was a bug included with the money and wanted to try again. This time the police listened to Alvirah when she told them that Nora had written one more story about a kidnapping and thought that they might follow the same idea. Nora was sent home from the hospital and she tried to find a copy of a story she had written when she was pregnant with Regan. The police tracked down Alvin and determined that he wasn't the kidnapper but rather a fan. He had a copy of the story they were looking for. Regan's father had said something in his conversation with her about a favorite book she had as a kid and she couldn't remember which one it was. Regan went to check on Rosita's kids and saw a book that her mother had given the kids about a little red lighthouse and the George Washington bridge. She remembered the book and figured that he was being held where he could see the bridge.Earnest Bumbles stopped by to drop off a gift for Luke and he mentioned the nephew of the deceased not being too happy that $1 million was given to his society. That set off bells with the ransom being $1 million. Ernest told the Reilly's that C. B. Dingle lived in Fort Lee. This was on the New Jersey side of the Washington Street Bridge. Fred was still with the kids and he found a postcard to Rosita from Petey Commer. The kids told him that Petey had worked for mr. Reilly as a painter. Fred took the kids with him to the Reilly's house to tell them about Petey. He knew they were wondering about the paint in Luke's car, which had been found. The postcard was from a bar near Ft. Lee. The police went there to see if they could find out where Petey was. The patrons at the bar told him about seeing him near a marina that was closed for the winter. Fred was with Regan and Alvirah when they raced to the boat they spotted. It was freezing cold out and a snow storm was coming. The boat was taking on water and sinking. Regan and Fred got Luke and Rosita out as the boat was going under. They were safe. The police caught Petey and CB because they followed the storyline and the police knew their route and the pickup location. The boys were happy to see their mother and Nora was happy to invite Jack Reilly into their house when he came by after the case was over. She was always trying to be a matchmaker for Regan and thought that Jack just might be a possible match for her."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/314565-angie", "userReview": "To be honest I'm teetering between one and two stars.
