Rooting for Sites to get over his own ego and self-plugging and write something decent, moving and real about the conflicts he covered proved fruitless. He endlessly mentioned his blog (I can't remember the name of it) and how it got millions of hits and was saving the world, etc. and how it's a pain to keep up with after a long day in a war zone, but so many were counting on him, etc. sigh, ad nauseum.Worse, the writing was hacked up and breezy, I presume, to make it the book feel like a blog. But this resulted in never enough information being shared. And whenever our intrepid reporter nearly got into a subject and was words away from writing with meat, he suddenly had to rush off to get his sat phone linked to the Yahoo office just in time for a deadline. Good work Kevin!

But I am not. I have seen the good in people and their resilience, but our violent nature is a formidable opponent. It feeds on the myths and lies we tell ourselves about war, that it is about the armies and the combatants, when truly, it is about the destruction of civil life; not just innocent people but our ideals and our humanity. The only hope may come from preserving and sharing the truth.\"This book should be required reading. For everyone. At times this book was almost overwhelming. I was overwhelmed by the sheer weight of knowledge in conflicts I had only a superficial (or nonexistent) knowledge of, the weight of the violence and the destruction and the death contained in these pages. Kevin Sites is a journalist who joins Yahoo! and decides to cover a huge array of conflicts in only one year. There are detailed statistics on every country he visits in the appendixes, but the writing does a solid job of providing background for each area as well. He attempts to interview both sides of warring factions, but he also focuses on the civilians caught in between. Sites is an excellent writer, it feels as though he is sharing these stories with you personally instead of using the dry language often found in reports. He tells the reader about his struggles with events, his fears, his biases, even his troubles with his girlfriend. Instead of detracting from the writing, I feel that it enhances it. The book also comes with a full length DVD that covers most of the events found in the book. I was close to tears at many parts, but actually seeing unarmed combatants being murdered, seeing dead children being pulled from bomb wreckage, hearing women tell about being raped and watching their children being murdered...The American media often ignores these conflicts, regardless of their massive death tolls or the US's involvement. We're fighting a war in the Middle East and yet most people have no understanding of what's going on for either side. This is a travesty. It's important for books like this to be read and spread so that we can be responsible global citizens instead of turning our backs on the rest of the world simply because they're not on the same soil as us."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2609289-katie", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the idea behind this book, but it's not without its problems. Sites' work brings to light many other \"hot zones\" throughout the world that do not receive the same press as places like Iraq and Afghanistan. Ultimately, he promotes an anti-war message by showing the pain and suffering war brings upon people. While I commend his approach, I falls short of executing it. His writing is very scattered and lacks a real flow. Granted, he began this project as a travel blog, so perhaps it worked better in that format than a series of subtitled entries thrown into one book. Additionally, while Sites attempts to bring to highlight lesser-known conflicts, he does not give equal attention to all of the conflicts he covers. His chapter on South America is extremely short and he discusses Haiti in less than 3 pages. Meanwhile, he makes multiple trips to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Lebanon. Clearly, Sites wants to focus on certain conflicts more than others (as do the media networks he criticizes). However, my biggest problem with Sites is his attempt to evoke emotion and sympathy from his readers while at the same time attempting to remain an unbiased journalist. For example, he wants us to feel the pain of land mine victims in order to see the devastating (and lasting) effects of war. But, when he comes upon a bombed out building and starts taking pictures of people in their grief and panic rather then help them; he wants us to understand that he's just doing his job. The one time he actually helps carry a injured woman to medical assistance, he's uncomfortable that he's seen doing this because journalists are not supposed to perform such acts. His writing is fairly emotionless, except for the view times he reflects on his own life, and this distracts from his overall goal to put a human face on war. Ultimately, Sites goals seem to run counter to each other. He wants to be a journalist and remain unbiased, but the story he attempts to tell cannot be told from an unbiased point of view. Conveying pain and suffering involves emotion, not objectivity."}, {"userName": "Yee Mey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2070993-yee-mey", "userReview": "(copied from a blog entry i posted that was inspired by reading this book.)\"sometimes i have this big grand dreams of doing something really heroic to save the world. these dreams are always on the grand scale of working at an international level, or collaborating with international people/organizations.well, i just started watching the complimentary dvd that came with this book. then i started thinking about why there are so many conflicts in the world. i wonder if perhaps a small part of the reason is the lack of people working on the small-scale. we see these conflicts after situations have spiraled way out of control, social structures have crumbled into anarchy, and people seem to have forgotten their humanity. if there are people at the ground level who do their small part, like a volunteer at the local library who reads stories to little children, will they not start building a generation with at least a small memory of what good one person can do? if we have a solid base of people who have no high-flying desire to save the world, but work steadily for their little community, perhaps we will have many strong little communities around the world. surely we can save the world by working our way from the ground level. surely the people on the ground are ever more important now. imagining for a moment the day that politicking eats itself up and dies out\u2026 rather than go away to a \u201cbetter\u201d place, maybe we can make a better place right here. wouldn\u2019t it be better to have many \u201cbetter\u201d places, rather than just one ideal place that everyone runs to after destroying their own? a sort of \u201cwall-e\u201d-inspired idea here.i know, i\u2019m not making a whole lot of sense right now, but these ideas are still very new and i\u2019m just mulling over them. i think my main idea is just this: every small good we do is worth something in the grand scheme of things, perhaps even more so than the big gestures.\""}, {"userName": "Maggie Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/184218-maggie-campbell", "userReview": "\"I hoped that when our national mourning was over, we, as American citizens, might feel a renewed sense of empathy because of this incident- one robust enough to transcend our national boundaries and inspire us to see the rest of the world.\"\"...I marvel at these strong women who have dressed in their best, most colorful clothes to meet us...These same wome, welcoming us with broad smiles and their rolling tongue chants, are forced to hide in the banana groves at night in fear of men bearing torches and guns who search them out.\"\"The story is about being loyal to the truth as a nation, that citizens of a democracy are collectively responsibile for what their troops do in war, good or bad.

It didn't quite work out like the author wanted it to: there was no collective \"Ah ha!\" moment of the US public (I didn't even know about the project until I read this book).

A nice launch pad from which to research on your own. Also included is the complimentary documentary of interesting and never-before-seen footage. The style is not worth writing home about, but the content is. As long as we are human (until Christ comes back - hopefully before 2012 when the world ends) the world will be at war. Human frailties and faults like greed, hubris, sloth, I could keep going, will keep us going to get other people's oil and diamonds, back stab for a higher paying job, and be first in line at the traffic light. It's too bad countries don't teach their children honest history (no matter how much face is lost); it might help to lessen blind perpetuation.

This was nothing less than a monumenally worldview-expanding experience for me.Sites says something near the end of the book to the effect that he's continually amazed by the seemingly willful ignorance of Americans when it comes to the unbelievable amount of conflict happening in the rest of the world; but I think it's not until we come face to face with something like this, of undeniably eye-opening value, that we are able to easily see past the smokescreen of palatability that gets wrapped around much of the information that is served to us here. It's oh so easy to just not go looking too hard beyond our borders.If you're nagged, too, by that feeling that you're not getting the whole story, and if you're brave enough to let go of your willful ignorance and look a little harder, THIS is your next must-read.Thank you, Kevin Sites.

News. Sites became the first reporter hired by Yahoo! after he and a producer friend pitched the idea of the \"Hot Zone\" blog to Yahoo!. Sites had experience as a war-correspondent for CNN and NBC and wanted to explore the stories of people on the ground who were involved in these conflicts in an attempt to put a human face on each side of these wars. His method is notable, especially to me, because he approaches this task as a pioneer in Solo-Journalism: the act of gathering information, writing stories, shooting still and video photography and posting his reports individually, with help only from his contacts and fixers in the various countries and a support staff based in the States. The digital world makes this possible and Sites utilizes a laptop, digital SLR camera and video camera and a satellite phone to collect information and file his reports.
