Having worked in the hospice field for many years. Many of these stories really tugged at my heart.I was informed a few days ago that a very close and dear friend has been diagnosed with this dreadful illness. I believe this book will be a great source of inspiration for her ."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2675257-chris", "userReview": "Bloody brilliant, but I guess I would say that !"}, {"userName": "Sophie Hurley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13040236-sophie-hurley", "userReview": "Halfway through this book and have found the stories very interesting so far. I like the fact its like a book of short stories and I can just read one or two a night before I go to bed! There are some pretty powerful accounts in here of how these people survived their treatment and came out the other side. I would recommend the book to anyone who is going through cancer or if you are a friend or family member of someone who is."}, {"userName": "Helen Keane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13064434-helen-keane", "userReview": "Wow, I got this book last week and am really enjoying it. Nearly finished it but just had to write my review. Having had several family members and friends go through cancer I really wanted to read this. I think the stories are very inspirational and will really help anyone going through this tough disease."}, {"userName": "Katie Collins", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67800535-katie-collins", "userReview": "I really enjoyed reading this book and learning about all the different people and their experiences with cancer. Everyone seemed to cope in their own unique way. The author includes his own story of survival plus a selection of others from different age groups and backgrounds. Sometimes we need to read things like this to appreciate how tough life can be and what it can throw at you. All these people really seem to have come through it in a good way and there's actually a nice little follow up note at the back which I thought was a good idea so you can see how everyone is doing now. Having lost family and friends to this dreadful disease I'm aware the outcome isn't good for everyone but I think this book is a good positive read for anyone going through it or who knows someone affected by cancer. Hence I gave it five stars.I hope the author is able to bring out a later version one day with more great stories of hope!"}, {"userName": "V.A.

Beating the odds and overcoming obstacles makes these survivors true champions. Giving back to their communities gives us all hope that yes we can and will get through this. Very helpful resources at back of book."}, {"userName": "Lucy Lang", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57877090-lucy-lang", "userReview": "I would recommend this book to anyone who has suffered, or has seen someone close suffer, the raw horror of a cancer diagnosis. The stories in this book are strangely soothing, as they chart the journey through the bewildering maze of cancer diagnosis, surgery and chemotherapy. The cancer patients show courage, spirit and a sense of humour, as they describe their ups and downs on their journey to recovery. Very inspiring!"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5861119-katie", "userReview": "All the stories in this book have one thing in common- the narrator credits their current state of survival to a positive attitude, or great mental strength. Cancer does not care about these things. What a kick in the face to all those who have died from cancer- to imply that it is their fault for not being positive or strong enough."}], "description": "The Cancer Survivors Club is a collection of truly inspirational, uplifting and assuring survival stories.
