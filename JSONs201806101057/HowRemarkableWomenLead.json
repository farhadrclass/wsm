Unfortunately - and particularly for women - any topic leads into an Oprah-zone of belief, aspiration, expression and self-actualization.Often, I would appreciate an understanding of capitalism and the workplace.How remarkable women lead is a solid book. It does contain too much over-sharing and 'inspirational role models' for my liking. There is not enough attention on how women's careers in particular were impacted by the global financial crisis. But there are some worthwhile models and modes. The capacity to 'reframe' is particularly useful. Also, there is some strong work in the second half on how to reschedule a ridiculous work schedule."}, {"userName": "Anna Danandeh", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72888282-anna-danandeh", "userReview": "The book does a good job explaining the idea of centered leadership consisting five dimensions of meaning, framing, connecting, engaging, energizing. One or some of these dimensions can be seen in the stories of successful women leaders in top corporations. I won't spoil it, but I found the emphasis on framing, i.e. having a correct and objective view of what has happened, being positive/optimistic and having a healthy lifestyle , i.e. working out, having stress relief plans, and eating healthy, valuable.The concept is explained through the stories. On the plus side, this makes you relate to the stories and see the advice played out. On the minus side, it did not communicate with a top down structure all the time- noticeable particularly in audio format. I like to clip important parts for future reference, so a summary in the end of each story would be a good addition. This would also also reinforce the actionability of the material."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3980735-laura", "userReview": "This reminded me a lot of \"Getting There\", by Gillian Zoe Segal, but a lot less compelling.

It is well worth the read just because of the stories of remarkable women. The downside is that I'm not convinced about the leadership model they have developed. It didn't seem as actionable as other models I have seen. The Centered Leadership model described in the book consists of 5 dimensions.\"Meaning. Makes it possible to reframe. It gives you the courage to step out of your comfort zone and engage with others. It creates the bond and it\u2019s what propels you to speak up. Meaning makes flow possible.\" \"Meaning is the motivation in your life. It\u2019s finding what engages you, what makes your heart beat faster, what gives you energy and creates passion. Meaning enables you to push yourself to the limit of your capabilities\u2014and beyond.\"\"[Positive] Framing. Unlocks the path to meaning. It creates the energy that attracts others to come on board. Framing shows you the opportunities and helps you manage the risks.\" (Authors cited lots of research on optimism and positive psychology.)\"Connecting. Enables you to find new opportunities that are meaningful to you. A tremendous source of energy, turning to others helps you reframe more effectively and build new capabilities. Relationships can be a source of energy, too.\"\"Engaging. Frees you to pursue meaning, to see the world differently, to reach out to others. It\u2019s liberating to make choices and own the outcome\u2014another source of new energy.\"\"Energizing. Helps you fill the room, attract others to you, take on new opportunities and face your fears, and have more positive impact on people who drain you of energy.\"Authors interviewed more than 165 men and women around the world and teased out their similarities. However it doesn't help much in replicating that. In a lot of stories it was clear that those women had enablers for those aspects of centered leadership already in childhood. For example, some already knew in the childhood who they wanted to be: \"\u201cFrom primary school, I knew I wanted to be a lawyer,\u201d says Amina. \u201cAnd I stuck to it.\u201d\". Shirley Tilgham: \"I'm often asked, \"When did you know you wanted to be a scientist?\" And my answer is always \"When didn't I want to be a scientist?\"\" Few others grew up confident: Shirley: \"I always had a fair amount of self-confidence, and that leads to a lot of very positive things. It allows you to be outgoing; it allows you to feel comfortable trying new things, unafraid of embarrassment. I think I was pretty courageous as a child thanks to this sense of absolute security in who I was, and this was because my parents gave me a sense of my true worth.\"Similarly some of the other advice is not very actionable: \"And often, meaning finds you (as opposed to the other way around).\" Authors write that to find meaningful work you have to find and know your strengths. For that they give a list of 24 strengths developed by some psychologists. It includes: \"curiosity, love of learning, judgment, integrity, kindness and loving, citizenship, leadership, appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, spirituality\" etc. How is gratitude a strength? Which career would be better for somebody whose strength is gratitude. And which career wouldn't want people with integrity? In my opinion, a much better way to find your strengths is to take Strength-Finder 2.0 test.Otherwise it was another good reminder to do networking and building relationships, especially sponsorships. Authors also talked about importance of energy management, getting enough sleep, going to gym. Another proof that happiness is important. \"Happiness is not just a nice-to-have goal. Emotional and psychological well-being are critically important to leadership for four very practical reasons: Happiness is motivating; happier teams are more creative; Leaders who exude happiness are more effective; happiness improces physical health, as well as stamina and resilience.\" \"A leader who finds true enjoyment in the work and is energized by it has a positive effect on those around her. Passion, enthusiasm, and energy are infectious\u2014mutually reinforcing when the whole team feels them.\"Finally I have a citation that I can use to explain why I don't like scary movies and sad movies/news :) \"In her experiments, people who experienced positive emotions by watching uplifting and funny films showed greater creativity in problem-solving\u2014and performed better\u2014than viewers of upsetting and sad films.\"I recommend reading this book if you want to read stories of remarkable women or after you have read The Confidence Code and Strength Finder 2.0."}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4455057-katherine", "userReview": "The advice in this book would probably have felt more groundbreaking to me if I weren't lucky enough to be in a work environment where they practice and preach a lot of these principles and really encourage career development conversations. I enjoyed the chapters written by specific women the most, though some of the summaries of interviews with different women and their life stories were good too. Also, it's largely focused on climbing the corporate ladder, so while I'm sure the concepts are applicable across all kinds of careers, you might have to work a little harder to figure out how to apply it if the corporate world is ultimately not your thing. It has a good amount of the annoying stuff that's in business/self-help books, especially those directed at women (\"Women are better than men at connecting because women are the nurturers and evolutionarily...\" blah blah etc.) but there are worse examples too, probably. Good for someone who wants to become an executive and has only just started their career or perhaps is stuck somewhere that they don't have a lot of support for growth."}, {"userName": "geneva  warbucks", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1523753-geneva-warbucks", "userReview": "This book had some great pieces, particularly the five areas they use as their framing: meaning,framing, connecting, engaging, and energizing. The personal stories from various women leaders were useful and this might be a good book for someone just starting out on their leadership journey.

The premise of the book is that women who are leaders follow five principles in their life:Meaning: Do what you love! You're probably not making a fortune off what you love, so you should think about it, make a drastic career transition and success will fall into place. Framing: All women leaders are optimistic. If you're not a successful leader you just need to think more positively. Connecting: This section had some solid tips on networking. Engaging: Take risks to get ahead. Which for the people featured in the book (who all went to expensive, top-ranked schools) this is valid advice. The book doesn't address the cost of risk taking for people who don't have a safety net. Energizing: This was the worst section in my opinion. Essentially, if you feel like you can't do it all, you should do something energizing to find more energy to do more. In addition to ignoring women who aren't from privileged backgrounds, this book references evolutionary biology as a reason that women are better at networking than men. Biology says that women \"tend and befriend\" while men are more combative; this is the same line of thinking that has women staying home to tend the family or says they're too emotional to be leaders. I think this line of thinking that women can have it all is damaging. You need to be fit, an amazing present mother, and an assertive leader, and if you're struggling it's because you're not optimistic enough. It doesn't recognize maybe doing it all isn't the path to happiness for all women. It focuses on the experiences of women in corporate management and tries to force that success paradigm on academia, completely ignoring women in STEM not to mention other arenas for leadership like in the community. We also see a complete lack of recognition of the socioeconomic privilege that gave the profiled women in leadership their leg up in life.Unrealistic book with reasonably good advice on networking and mentorship."}, {"userName": "Kaitlin Oujo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15361429-kaitlin-oujo", "userReview": "The McKinsey approach to female development in the workplace.

While it is aimed at women who work outside the home and have lofty career goals, there is so much to takeaway from this book for any woman who is in a position to lead and work well with others. I listed to it on Audible, and I was captivated by some of the stories and advice shared. The ideas and concepts can easily be translated into my philanthropic commitments and the boards of directors on which I sit. Barsh started this project because she was looking for inspiration for her own career. Once she sat down with some of these women she realized that the stories would translate well to a larger project that many women could access. First it was a website and then a book. Each woman's journey is so different that the book never felt repetitive. The one running theme (besides ambition) was their optimism about their careers and projects that didn't go well. Each woman took failures as learning experiences and managed to use them as a way to grow her career rather than end it.I highly recommend this book to any woman who is in a leadership role or wishes to be in a leadership role, whether professionally or otherwise.

I tried to find counter arguments against Michael Lewis as I don't want to be biased, but in the end I still concluded that what HFT firms are doing is legal robbery. No wonder they are making so much money! No wonder they are offering $200k a year for fresh phds in my field. Then the next question comes: how many of us will take the offer? Would I take any offer to rob a house? Probably not, but how about if it's legal and I will never get caught? Temping, but still no.

To me, this is akin to objecting to too many letters in an epistolary novel, since in the case of both titles, you're likely already aware the format of the book will inform the content. I found Brash's anecdotes to be helpful on balance, and part of a well-thought out structure around individual and team leadership that a woman could easily use at any time in career. I especially appreciate this as a counterpoint to Sandberg's \"Lean In,\" which presented a singular view in the guise of a one-size-fits-all-approach, whereas \"How Remarkable Women Lead\" seems to celebrate the plurality of female experience.

The point that 75% of an individuals capital is in relationships caused me to reconsider the importance of networking. Second, I found the chapter on physical energy compelling.
