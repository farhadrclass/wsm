I've read all the books in this series; loved every one of them, but \"Will You Marry Me\" had me in stitches. I'm a tough sell when it comes to humor. Enter a convention of humans in chickens costumes .... listen to their clucks of conversation ... realize that the convention is not just about being a chicken, but has additional perks, you can't help but join in on the fun reading this hilarious, upbeat cozy mystery. What starts out as a road trip, ends up in more of a village than a town trying to solve a murder while working with Jim Bob, Bob Bob, and Mary Bob and other quirky characters. And then there's the final \"awww moment we've all been waiting for. This one has it all; romance, mystery, murder and downright slapstick humor. Author Jerilyn DuFresne is around to stay, and that's a good thing."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15959594-helen", "userReview": "Will you Marry Me: As posted on Amazon: Every book in this series gets better. The story line is perfect, as the charactors feel like real people (dog) to the point I feel sad when I come to the end of the book. I just love Sam as she so mnuch reminds me of myself, and it is a trat to read that quirky is ok. I just love how people kept coming up chicken! The romance between Sam and George is so sweet. Can't wait to read t he next one!"}, {"userName": "Michelle Adams", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41959799-michelle-adams", "userReview": "Not as impressedI enjoyed the book. Just not as impressed as I was the with the previous 3 in this series. The whole chicken thing was humorous at first, then just made me feel weird and uncomfortable. The characters are relatable. The plot was good. Just wasn't as into this book as the others."}, {"userName": "Jeannie and Louis Rigod", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3049435-jeannie-and-louis-rigod", "userReview": "This fourth volume in a very funny murder mystery series, finds Sam Darling, George, and Clancy on a vacation to the Grand Canyon.Sam, it seems, has forgotten her new meds for her recently diagnosed ADHD.
