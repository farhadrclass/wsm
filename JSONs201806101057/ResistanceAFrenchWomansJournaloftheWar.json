I consider it one of the better books written on the subject. It begins and ends with transcripts of the author\u2018s diary entries. The first date from June 1940 to April 1941, ending two days before the author\u2019s interrogation by the Gestapo. The final diary transcripts date from April 1945, four years later, after American liberation. The intervening section was written immediately after the war. It covers her imprisonment, trial, deportation to Germany and life as a slave worker, classified as a political criminal. The book was first published in 1946 and it was one of the first of its kind. Its immediacy, the author\u2019s candor and rambunctious spirit shine throughout. This is a remarkable book. The author has something vital to tell us and she does it with precision, candor, spirit and humor. Humor in a book detailing the life in labor camps? Yes, biting humor! Humor, when the situation is as bad as it is, almost hurts.I get back from the factory after a truly grueling night, prostrated with exhaustion. I am going to sleep like a log, I know. But then I see my bunk is already occupied. I start to make a fuss, but a plaintive voice beneath my blankets soon pulls me up short: \u2018Oh please, please, don\u2019t be angry. I haven\u2019t got lice and I haven\u2019t made your bed dirty. \u2018I discover this is the new regulation. For lack of space, the day shift and the night shift will take turns to sleep in the same bunks. From now on we will find our bunks already warmed for us. How delightful.  (page 151)I marked line after line that I wanted to quote, but I simply cannot put them all here. One example will have to suffice.Agn\u00e8s Humbert (Oct 12, 1894 \u2013 Sept 19, 1963) was a mature woman of forty-six at the date of her first diary entries. She had a solid political background. An art historian, she is articulate, well-educated, committed and passionate. As a member of the fledgling French Resistance, as one with vivid war experiences of life in labor camps and as one there in the confusion of the war\u2019s aftermath, she describes it all, simply and powerfully. She experienced it all, and she has a remarkable writing ability. All parts are written in the first person present tense. This was one of the most difficult war books I have ever read, difficult simply because she makes it so very real and she makes the reader care. ETA: I should perhaps add that the book has a well written Afterward. I read it in fact both before and again after finishing the book. You get additional information about the author.

It is a unique account of WW11 told from the viewpoint of a French art historian whose acts of bravery and resistance eventually get her arrested. Despite deportation to Germany and two years in a slave labor camp, Humbert maintains her humanity, her sense purpose, not to mention her sense of humor. A wonderful example of these takes place after liberation. Agnes is put in charge of the local German population (her organizing abilities and her personal strength are immediately apparent to the allies). She points a toy gun at the the German civilians and threatens them with it when they are reluctant to follow her orders. Then, she goes off giggling with her friend. There are literary, artistic and intellectual allusions throughout the book. Some of them I had to look up. My GR friend Wendy wrote that this is a woman she would have loved to meet.

Yet during the darkest of the darkest moments and in the most desperate of circumstances, Agn\u00e8s Humbert embodies courage, strength and purpose.R\u00e9sistance was founded by intellectuals who had no knowledge of espionage, intelligence gathering or secret codes. Their strength was drawn from moral anger and used brilliantly in their fight against tyranny and injustice. Agn\u00e8s Humbert, a 46-year-old art historian and ethnographer, was an improbable candidate for the task that lay ahead. Divorced, with two adult sons, she worked at The Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Homme, one of Paris\u2019s most prestigious museums. Co-conspirators included the unlikely Jean Cassou, distinguished cultural and political figure of prewar France, Boris Vild\u00e9, an authority in the Polar Regions, and Anatole Lewitsky, a specialist on Siberian shamanism. Not the usual people selected for an underground movement.R\u00e9sistance is not an easy read because it gives graphic details of what actually happened in the work camps and prisons during World War II. It is intense and candid. While there are betrayals and deaths, it is primarily a story of redemption and about the friendships cemented by a common cause. As the story unfolds, I was captivated by the humour and the laughter; at the same time, I was awestruck by how many risks were taken to distribute their newspaper, R\u00e9sistance.Would I be as courageous? Would I see the danger? Would I resist evil? If you read R\u00e9sistance \u2013 and I strongly suggest you do \u2013 these are the hard-hitting questions you will ask yourself when you meet Agn\u00e8s Humbert.https://ontheroadbookclub.com/"}, {"userName": "Marty Selnick", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2966243-marty-selnick", "userReview": "This book is the actual journal of a Frenchwoman's experiences during World War II. At the start of the war Agn\u00e8s Humbert was a bookish art historian working in a museum in Paris. After the occupation of Paris began Agnes and other staff at the museum were replaced by Nazi sympathizers. Together with some of her friends she decided to form a small resistance cell to share information and publish anti-Nazi propaganda in a pamphlet called 'Resistance'. This cell was composed of other middle classed scholars, artists, writers, and even some social gadflies. All well intentioned amateurs. So, you can imagine a resistance run by amateurs was inevitably riddled with amateur errors. It was not long before the arrests began. Agnes was arrested in 1941 and spent the next four years in abominable circumstances. Prisons, forced labor, and slavery. Throughout she managed to stay alive. This is the story of a remarkable woman who was very brave in dangerous times, and of her ability to deal with very harsh conditions.The book is written in the first person, present tense which gives it a real sense of urgency. The first third of the book is her own journal entries from her time working for the Resistance. The remainder of it was written during the nine months after her liberation, but she continued to write it in the style of a diary as if she had a journal and pen in prison with her. She writes \"my memories are so clear that I am able to commit them to paper as they happened and in strict sequence. I remember everything as clearly as though it was written in notebooks, one event after another\".

Her journal is first person, present tense, and, except for the years in prison, written at the time, as the events occurred. This gives it an immediacy and authenticity both powerful and rare. Her style combines a dispassionate description of often harrowing facts and events with her passoniate, personal reaction to them -- poignant, intelligent, full of rage, humor and humanity. The physical and psychological suffering she endured would have destroyed most people -- and did destroy some of the others she crossed paths with. But she found somewhere the strength to maintain her integrity and her righteous indignation and she survived. A quote from the journal written after her liberation, after all she went through, underlines the relevance of her story today: \"...in the end, national frontiers exist only as lines on maps. There are just people: those who fight for civilization, and those who fight against it. Just those two camps.

A middle-aged Parisian academic who \u2013 by her own admission \u2013 had lived a lot of her life through books, but who nevertheless found steel in her soul when the Germans invaded in 1940. Joining up with like-minded friends and acquaintances, all inspired by speeches by the exiled Charles de Gaulle, she worked within Paris to drive forward a resistance and keep the notion of a Free France constantly in French citizen\u2019s minds. However, that is only the first part of this memoir, as Humbert and her cohorts were soon betrayed and she spent the rest of the war in dank prisons and then working as a slave labourer for the Nazis. The descriptions of what she and her fellow prisoners went through remain incredibly harrowing, but Humbert refused to allow her spirit to buckle \u2013 and it\u2019s that resistance these pages chronicle.Deep down in the British psyche there\u2019s still a grudge towards the French at how easily they surrendered in The Second World War, so it\u2019s refreshing and illuminating to read a first-hand account of the anger which flared up in Paris. Yes, there were people more than happy to collaborate with the invaders and with the new Vichy government, but there were others \u2013 right from the start \u2013 determined to disrupt the machine. Whether that was just sticking up banners for de Gaulle in toilets or other public places, or typing \u201cVive le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle!\u201d on banknotes (as no one could afford to throw away a banknote, so they\u2019d have to be passed hand to hand) or more ambitiously starting an anti-Nazi newspaper, these were people who took great risks for what they believed.But it wasn\u2019t just the politically engaged Humbert met. One of the truly interesting things about the book though is how when Humbert was imprisoned, many of the other inmates were German. Women of the Fatherland who\u2019d committed, in some cases, quite meaningless crimes but were given of years of hard labour in consequence. And even though they were members of Aryan race, they were not spared the cruelty of their captors. As that\u2019s the conclusion Humbert reaches, that there was no shared ideology in Nazism, it just allowed certain Germans to give into their lowest impulses and hurt, humiliate and even kill other people. Humbert herself was beaten, starved of food, water and medical treatment, and had her hand dipped in acid. And yet when recalling these dreadful moments, she is able to insert in moments of humour which show how well her spirit survived. Here she is on the moment her captors told her she was now a grandmother, but \u2013 for no reason other than spite \u2013 rudely refused to answer any of her follow-up questions: \u201cWhat a peculiar sort of woman I must be. Not satisfied with knowing that I am a grandmother, I also have to know the sex of my grandchild, his name and whether my daughter-in-law is well. Doubtless German grandmothers are much less curious!\u201dOnly the opening section of the book, before Humbert is captured, is an actual diary. When she was a prisoner it would have been almost impossible to do (and a risk not worth taking if she was caught). As such most of the book is written in the immediate aftermath of the war, however her anger at the various injustices and humiliations she and her fellow prisoners suffered is still sharp and painful . There are a few odd mistakes (America enters the war a month earlier than it should) and it does have an idealised view of Stalin\u2019s Russia that was commonplace amongst the left in the thirties and forties, but this is a powerful, unremitting, compassionate and inspiring memoir."}, {"userName": "Kiwi Begs2Differ  \u270e", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12287031-kiwi-begs2differ", "userReview": "Another memoir from an eye witness to the horrors of WWII.

Bar-none one of the most compelling reads this year for me. I have been reading about the circumstances of WWII this year from many points of view purely by accident. This book by far exceeds the others. Perhaps it is because I find Agnes to be a testament to the strength of women. Also because most of literature on the subject of the Holocaust seems to be written by men, about men and about only the experiences OF men. This memoir reminded me of the story of Corrie Ten Boom from Haarlem, the Netherlands. I wonder why we have not heard of Agnes before? Considering that, I should hope to see many more stories of women who suffered the Nazi occupation of Western Europe.This book is one that will appeal to your intelligence, but will leave you crushed and tattered at times. It is a difficult read. Heartbreaking to imagine someone going through this experience. It was difficult to acclimate myself to the beginning of the book but after the first 30-50 pages or so...you just can't put it down. Bravo.

Agnes Humbert kept a journal of her daily life from the beginning of June 1940, and even this journal was bordering on foolish with the intensive scrutiny and activity by the SS and their fear of any criticism or protest against their regime. Agnes, along with numerous others from her workplace at a museum in Paris, helped pioneer the resistance movements as they sought to fight the Nazi propaganda and also alert the French people as to what was really happening in their country. Her resistance cell decided to produce a broadsheet \"Resistance\" which they distributed through a network of contacts until the SS finally caught them in April 1941. Her male compatriots were executed by firing squad and Agnes was sentenced to five years imprisonment. From that time until April 1945 Agnes was transported to Germany and worked as a slave labourer in appaling conditions. She was of course unable to write a journal during that time, but according to the afterword, written by Julien Blanc, she had an amazing memory for detail and names and was then able to complete her account of those four years, writing them as a continous journal following the fall of the Third Reich. Her suffering, and those of her fellow prisoners was horrifying. Starvation, freezing conditions, handling chemicals which burned through the flesh, suicides, brutal overseers were all part of those four years.

Technically a journal only up to the point when Humbert's means of recording her experiences were taken away by her captors, the stark and vivid recollections of the author's months and years in confinement, neglect, abuse and forced labor offer testament against the depravity of an entire regime.

She also coordinated the founding of a charity which provided help to Germans who were disenfranchised and dispossessed by the war-people who didn\u2019t resist as she did, but who also did not help the Nazis.

Humbert was a founding member of a resistance group in France during occupation by the Nazis in WWII. Her diary describes not only the fall of France and founding a resistance group, but her imprisonment once she is caught and imprisoned. The bulk of the diary, in fact, describes her imprisonment and her experiences at work camps. The book itself presents a view that isn't too often seen in America. Some details that stand out are the reasons while some of her fellow prisoners were jailed. One woman, a German, was jailed because she traded her meat ration to get shoes for her children.

She was tenacious and feisty (often to her own detriment) and unafraid to the right thing even at risk to herself. Reading about the early days of the French Resistance, it is unbelievable how naiive Humbert and her colleagues were. I'm not surprised that they were caught so quickly, but I can't help but be impressed by their courage. Her story was very interesting, but there are still a few loose ends that we might not be able to ever tie up (as is the nature of these diaries). Still, I found her story quite inspiriting. She must have been an incredible person."}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44379267-katherine", "userReview": "Heartbreaking and frightening how unjust, ignorant and cruel people can be, and on such a massive scale even in our own time. It is only through self-deception that we can pretend that the Third Reich was an aberration far in the past that can't be repeated, that isn't in fact being repeated in some parts of the world today, or that one's own countrymen are somehow above or immune to human depravity. The preservation of human dignity is something we must foster and protect, not assume. Agnes Humbert's is an important book for what it recounts. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": " Barb Bailey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1127910-barb-bailey", "userReview": "This was a well written book that included Agnes Humberts' diary written during the occupation of Paris during WWII. Agnes was part of the original Resistance group along with 9 other patriots . Her remarkable story tells of her arrest, sentencing, and experiences while imprisoned in both France and Germany and then finally of her release.

Agnes is magnetic and indomitable, and even the darkest parts of her narrative are lit by her sheer force of personality.This book is a riveting look into the flip side of the Resistance that I have been reading about for so long. This is the grassroots homegrown French Resistance, and the contact with London is distant and removed - the stuff of rumors, almost. A fascinating addition to my research and highly, highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Sunny", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56895191-sunny", "userReview": "I don't have words.

Technically a journal only up to the point when Humbert's means of recording her experiences were taken away by her captors, the stark and vivid recollections of the author's months and years in confinement, neglect, abuse and forced labor offer testament against the depravity of an entire regime.

Though she might well have weathered the oppressive regime, Humbert was stirred to action by the atrocities she witnessed. In an act of astonishing bravery, she joined forces with several colleagues to form an organized resistance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dvery likely the first such group to fight back against the occupation. (In fact, their newsletter, R\u00c3\u00a9sistance, gave the French Resistance its name.) \nIn the throes of their struggle for freedom, the members of Humbert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s group were betrayed to the Gestapo; Humbert herself was imprisoned. In immediate, electrifying detail, Humbert describes her time in prison, her deportation to Germany, where for more than two years she endured a string of brutal labor camps, and the horror of discovering that seven of her friends were executed by a firing squad. But through the direst of conditions, and ill health in the labor camps, Humbert retains hope for herself, for her friends, and for humanity.\nOriginally published in France in 1946, the book was soon forgotten and is now translated into English for the first time. R\u00c3\u00a9sistance is more than a firsthand account of wartime France: it is the work of a brave, witty, and forceful woman, a true believer who refused to go quietly.", "title": "Resistance: A French Woman's Journal of the War", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3017519-resistance", "average": 4.07, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312031780l/3017519.jpg", "reviews": 159, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2112596.Agn_s_Humbert", "name": "Agn\u00e8s Humbert"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1297150.Barbara_Mellor", "name": "Barbara Mellor"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3923653.Julien_Blanc", "name": "Julien Blanc"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "War", "Autobiography", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3017519-resistance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4043453-resistance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9814745-resistance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6633425-r-sistance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4496719-resistance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35922265-r-sistance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3017520-resistance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3963981-resistance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4496718-resistance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29748326-notre-guerre"]}
